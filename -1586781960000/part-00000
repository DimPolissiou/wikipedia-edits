Its official creation date is July 1971 during the [[Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971]]. In 1971, with [[West Pakistan]] imposing a brutal military crackdown in [[East Pakistan]], the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, ''PADMA'' and ''PALASH'', and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small [[patrol vessel]]s, was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|title=War of Liberation, The|publisher=banglapedia.org}}</ref> These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the [[Indian Air Force]] on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |title=Bangladesh Navy in Liberation War |website=Bangladesh Navy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092723/http://bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |archive-date=13 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Independence to the end of the 20th century===\nThe navy carried out around 45 operations during the war: traditional naval operations and unconventional [[commando]] operations including [[guerrilla warfare]].  In the first leg of the war, defecting [[Bengal]]i sailors joined the guerrilla forces. It was the eight sailors who defected from the [[Pakistan Navy]] submarine ''PNS Mangro'', under construction in France, that pioneered the formation of the naval element during the Liberation War.  Later many other naval personnel participated.  During the Liberation War, [[East Pakistan]] was divided into 11 sectors.  Each sector had a Commander and a demarcated area of responsibility except sector 10. Sector 10 was nominally responsible for the coastal belt but actually operated over the entire country.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Navy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704035414/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, it was imperative for the occupation force to keep ports and harbours operative and the sea lines of communication open. The Bangladesh Navy fought to block the sea lines of communication, and to make the sea and river ports inoperative. They attacked all the seaports including many river ports. [[Operation Jackpot]] is one of the best known and most successful operations. They carried out [[Naval mine|mining]] in the [[Pasur River]] Channel by patrol craft. With other fighters they also carried out attacks against the Pakistan Army.  As a result, Bangladesh became an independent state within the shortest possible time.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Naval Academy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015728/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter independence, especially in the 1970s, additional naval infrastructure was required.

Its official creation date is July 1971 during the [[Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971]]. In 1971, with [[West Pakistan]] imposing a brutal military crackdown in [[East Pakistan]], the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, ''PADMA'' and ''PALASH'', and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small [[patrol vessel]]s, was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|title=War of Liberation, The|publisher=banglapedia.org}}</ref> These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the [[Indian Air Force]] on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |title=Bangladesh Navy in Liberation War |website=Bangladesh Navy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092723/http://bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |archive-date=13 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Independence to the end of the 20th century===\nThe navy carried out around 45 operations during the war: traditional naval operations and unconventional [[commando]] operations including [[guerrilla warfare]].  In the first leg of the war, defecting [[Bengal]]i sailors joined the guerrilla forces. It was the eight sailors who defected from the [[Pakistan Navy]] submarine ''PNS Mangro'', under construction in France, that pioneered the formation of the naval element during the Liberation War.  Later many other naval personnel participated.  During the Liberation War, [[East Pakistan]] was divided into 11 sectors.  Each sector had a Commander and a demarcated area of responsibility except sector 10. Sector 10 was nominally responsible for the coastal belt but actually operated over the entire country.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Navy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704035414/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, it was imperative for the occupation force to keep ports and harbours operative and the sea lines of communication open. The Bangladesh Navy fought to block the sea lines of communication, and to make the sea and river ports inoperative. They attacked all the seaports including many river ports. [[Operation Jackpot]] is one of the best known and most successful operations. They carried out [[Naval mine|mining]] in the [[Pasur River]] Channel by patrol craft. With other fighters they also carried out attacks against the Pakistan Army.  As a result, Bangladesh became an independent state within the shortest possible time.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Naval Academy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015728/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter independence, especially in the 1970s, additional naval infrastructure was required.

It gave immense contributions to the [[Gujarati theatre]], with productions of more than hundred plays, as well as the training and introducing of many major actors and directors.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Gujarati Natak Mandali (1878\u201389) ===\nGujarati theatre was established on the foundation of the Gujarati Natak Mandali. It was founded in response to discontent with the [[Parsi theatre]] company owner Framji Gustadji Dalal. The playwright [[Ranchhodbhai Dave]], who had previously worked with Natak Uttejak Mandali (1875\u201394), helped in the starting and management of the new troupe, which initially started as an amateur group of Gujarati teachers.  On 5 June 1878, three partners, Jayshankar Sarveshvar, Narottam Bhaichand, and Shivshankar Karasanji, co-founded the company, which later became known as Mehtajis' theatre company. Later they were joined by Manekram Dhirajram, Damodar Ratansi Somani, and Lalji Karsanji as new partners. The partners were responsible for various departments of the company.  Sarveshvar was the manager and director of the company. The company pioneered the pure Gujarati culture-influenced theatre, free from any Parsi influences.<ref name=\"ox2\">{{cite book|last=Bhojak|first=Dinkar J.|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195644463.001.0001/acref-9780195644463-e-0201#|title=The Oxford Companion to Indian Theatre|publisher=[[Oxford University]] Press|year=2004|isbn=9780195644463|editor-last=Lal|editor-first=Ananda|location=|pages=|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195644463.001.0001|via=Oxford Reference}}</ref>{{snf|Choksi|2004|pp=11-12}}\n\nThe company first produced ''Lalita Dukhdarshak'' (Lalita's Manifold Sufferings), a reformist play written and directed by Dave. It premiered on 6 January 1878 at the Victoria Theatre in front of an audience of 1200 people. It was the first social tragedy in the Gujarati language, with five acts and thirty-four scenes. It had twenty characters, including the character of Nandan, whose name became synonymous with a fool.<ref name=\"ox2\" />\n\nDave wrote and directed the second play, ''Nal Damayanti'' (Nala and Damayanti), which also became successful.

It gave immense contributions to the [[Gujarati theatre]], with productions of more than hundred plays, as well as the training and introducing of many major actors and directors.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Gujarati Natak Mandali (1878\u201389) ===\nGujarati theatre was established on the foundation of the Gujarati Natak Mandali. It was founded in response to discontent with the [[Parsi theatre]] company owner Framji Gustadji Dalal. The playwright [[Ranchhodbhai Dave]], who had previously worked with Natak Uttejak Mandali (1875\u201394), helped in the starting and management of the new troupe, which initially started as an amateur group of Gujarati teachers.  On 5 June 1878, three partners, Jayshankar Sarveshvar, Narottam Bhaichand, and Shivshankar Karasanji, co-founded the company, which later became known as Mehtajis' theatre company. Later they were joined by Manekram Dhirajram, Damodar Ratansi Somani, and Lalji Karsanji as new partners. The partners were responsible for various departments of the company.  Sarveshvar was the manager and director of the company. The company pioneered the pure Gujarati culture-influenced theatre, free from any Parsi influences.<ref name=\"ox2\">{{cite book|last=Bhojak|first=Dinkar J.|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195644463.001.0001/acref-9780195644463-e-0201#|title=The Oxford Companion to Indian Theatre|publisher=[[Oxford University]] Press|year=2004|isbn=9780195644463|editor-last=Lal|editor-first=Ananda|location=|pages=|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195644463.001.0001|via=Oxford Reference}}</ref>{{snf|Choksi|2004|pp=11-12}}\n\nThe company first produced ''Lalita Dukhdarshak'' (Lalita's Manifold Sufferings), a reformist play written and directed by Dave. It premiered on 6 January 1878 at the Victoria Theatre in front of an audience of 1200 people. It was the first social tragedy in the Gujarati language, with five acts and thirty-four scenes. It had twenty characters, including the character of Nandan, whose name became synonymous with a fool.<ref name=\"ox2\" />\n\nDave wrote and directed the second play, ''Nal Damayanti'' (Nala and Damayanti), which also became successful. Other plays, ''Harishchandra'', ''Madalsa ane Ritudhvaj'' (Madalsa and Ritudhvaj), and ''Banasur Madmardan'' (Taming of Banasur's Arrogance) were also produced by the company.<ref name=\"ox2\" />\n\nChhotalal Mulchand Kapadia of [[Khambhat]] bought the Gujarati Natak Mandali with two other partners.

The songs of the play were written by [[Rasiklal Parikh]] and four shows of it were staged. Later he staged four plays written by Champshi Udeshi, four plays written by Gajendrashankar Pandya as well as many Parsi theatre styled plays. Gajendrashankar Pandya's play ''College Kanya'' (College Girl, 1925) starred popular actors [[Pransukh Nayak]] and Chhagan Romeo as comedians and it created controversy due to some of its dialogue about females; [[Narsinhrao Divetia]], [[Chandravadan Mehta]] and [[Hansa Jivraj Mehta]] led the public protests against the play.<ref name=\"Baradi2003\" /><ref name=\"ox2\" /> \n\nThe company suffered due to internal squabbling and jealousy. Mulani had left the company. After death of Dayashankar Girnara, Sorabji Katrak was brought in as a new director. Bapulal highlighted his directorial mistakes so the owners of the company established a separate Mumbai Urdu Natak Mandali which was closed down after a year and Katrak had to left. The owner Maganlal and Chhotalal were focused on profits only. Bapulal wanted to be a director and writer so he played a major role in outing others. Jaishankar Sundari too left the company and joined Laxmikant Natak Samaj for a brief period before returning to the company. After sometime, he retired from the theatre in 1932. p.19 Mulani also retired in 1932.<ref name=\"gsp\" /><ref name=\"ox\" /> ''Nepolean'' (1937), written by Manilal Pagal, was premiered in Sayaji Theatre in [[Baroda State|Baroda]].{{snf|Choksi|2004|p=18}}\n\nMany poor quality plays produced only for profits led to their failure. The high salaried actors, costly productions and failure of plays led to the loss. With the advent of the cinema, the theatre started to lose its audience.

The episcopal seat is the [[Nottingham Cathedral|Cathedral Church of St Barnabas]] in  [[Nottingham]]. \n\nThe Right Reverend [[Patrick McKinney]] is the 10th [[Bishop of Nottingham (Roman Catholic)|Bishop of Nottingham]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Nottingham Roman Catholic Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Nottingham Cathedral]]\nIt was one of twelve English dioceses created at the [[Universalis Ecclesiae|restoration of the hierarchy]] by [[Pius IX]] in 1850, embracing the counties of Nottingham, Leicester, Derby, Lincoln and Rutland. These had comprised part of the [[Apostolic Vicariate of the Midland District]], when at the request of [[James II of England|King James II]] in 1685, the Holy See divided England into four [[vicariate]]s: the London, the Northern, the Midland and the Western. Before 1840, when the number of vicars apostolic was increased from four to eight, the Midland District consisted of fifteen counties.<ref name=Croft>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11133a.htm Croft, William. \"Diocese of Nottingham.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 27 February 2019</ref>\n\nIn 1850 Nottingham had 24 permanent [[Mission (Christian)|mission]]s, many of these little better than villages. For the most part they originated from chaplaincies which had through penal times been maintained by the Catholic nobility and gentry, or had been founded independently by them. Among these there existed foundations of several religious orders. In Derbyshire the [[Jesuits]] had missions at [[Chesterfield]] and [[Church of the Immaculate Conception, Spinkhill|Spinkhill]], in Lincolnshire at Lincoln, Boston and [[Market Rasen]]. The [[Dominican Order]] was settled in [[Leicester]], the [[Fathers of Charity]] carried on several missions in Leicestershire, and the [[Cistercians]] occupied  [[Mount St Bernard Abbey]] in [[Charnwood Forest]].<ref name=Croft/>\n\nFrom the appearance of the Jesuits in England in 1580 at the special request of Dr [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Allen]], they had done much by their labours to keep alive the Catholic faith in the Nottingham diocese. Of their missions mentioned above some were among the earliest of the Society of Jesus in England dating back some three hundred years. Derby was included in the district or college of the Society called the \"Immaculate Conception\", founded by Father [[Richard Blount]], about 1633, first [[provincial superior]] of the English Province. Extinct for many years, it was partially revived in 1842 as [[Mount St Mary's College]], when the new college and ''convictus'' was established by the then provincial, Father Randall Lythgoe.<ref name=Croft/>\n\nAfter the Reformation, the English Province of the [[Friars Preachers]] ceased to exist, until resuscitated at [[Bornem]] in Flanders by [[Philip Howard (cardinal)|Philip Howard]], later cardinal, who became the first [[prior]] of the Dominicans in 1675. The first introduction of the English Dominicans from Bornem was at [[Hinckley]], whence for many years Leicester was served by them at intervals. Their mission at Leicester was put on a permanent basis in 1798 by the purchase of a house by Father Francis Xavier Choppelle. [[Holy Cross Priory, Leicester]] was begun by Father Benedict Caestryck in 1815 and was opened in 1819. The dedication under the title of [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]] was adopted on account of the celebrated relic of the Holy Cross brought from Bornem.\n\nAfter the lapse of three centuries a monastery of the Cistercian Order was resuscitated in England by the foundation of the [[Mount St Bernard Abbey|Abbey of Mount St Bernard]] in Leicestershire, made possible by the assistance of [[Ambrose Phillips de Lisle]] of [[Grace Dieu Manor]], who after his conversion in December 1825, devoted his energies to the spread of the Catholic faith in England by the re-establishment in the country of monastic institutions. In 1835 he purchased about {{convert|227|acre|km2}} of wild uncultivated land in Charnwood Forest and presented it to the [[Cistercians]].<ref>Purcell, Edmund Sheridan. ''Life and Letters of Ambrose Phillipps de Lisle'', p.66, Macmillan and Co., Ltd., London, 1900</ref> \n\nBeginning with one brother who lived alone in a four-roomed cottage, the community rapidly increased, and a larger building was erected as well as a small chapel, opened by Dr Walsh on 11 October 1837. In a short time this proved insufficient and [[John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury]] offered them \u00a32,000, on condition that a new monastery should be erected, choosing for that purpose the present site of the abbey. It was built from designs by [[Augustus Pugin]]. In 1848 by Papal Brief of [[Pius IX]] the monastery of Mount St Bernard was raised to the dignity of an abbey, and Father Bernard, the first [[mitred abbot]] in England since the Reformation, was consecrated on 18 February 1849.\n\nIn introducing the Cistercians into England, de Lisle had hoped that they would undertake missionary work and with this view he had built three chapels: at [[Grace-Dieu]], [[Whitwick]] and the abbey. On the score of their rule, they declined to take charge permanently of the missions. De Lisle then decided to bring from Italy members of the [[Institute of Charity]]. After much negotiation with the head of the order, [[Aloysius Gentili|Father Gentili]] came to Grace Dieu as chaplain. This was the commencement of the settlement of the Rosminians in the diocese. In 1841 Dr Walsh made over to them the secular mission of [[Loughborough]] founded in 1832 by Father Benjamin Hulme. The buildings were too small to permit of a [[novitiate]] and a college of their own which they were desirous to establish. To carry out this twofold object, about {{convert|9|acre|m2}} were purchased; the foundation stone of the new buildings was laid in May 1843 and in 1844 was opened the first college and novitiate house of the institute in England. The [[Sisters of Mercy]] had come to Nottingham in 1844, and in 1846 entered their convent in close proximity to the cathedral.\n\nThe first Bishop of Nottingham was the Rt Rev. [[Joseph William Hendren]], O.S.F. (born 1792), consecrated on 10 September 1848, as [[Vicar Apostolic]] of the Western District, transferred to the [[bishopric of Clifton]] on 29 September 1850, and to Nottingham on 22 June 1851. The cathedral church of St Barnabas, of the lancet style of architecture, is considered one of the best specimens of the work of Pugin.\n\nOwing to ill-health Dr Hendren resigned in 1853 and was succeeded by Dr [[Richard Roskell]], born at [[Gateacre]], near Liverpool, in 1817. He was sent to [[Ushaw College]] and afterwards to Rome, where he took his degree and was ordained in 1840. He was consecrated in the cathedral by Cardinal Wiseman on 21 September 1853. During his episcopate a number of missions were founded in the counties of the diocese. In Lincolnshire, through the generosity of Thomas Arthur Young of [[Kingerby Hall]], not only was there a church and presbytery built at [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and [[St Mary's Church, Grimsby|Grimsby]], but the [[Premonstratensian]] order was re-introduced into England at [[Crowle, Lincolnshire|Crowle]] and [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]]. Thomas Young also planned to build a church in Lincoln, but it was not until 1893 that [[St Hugh's Church, Lincoln]] was opened.<ref name=stock>[http://taking-stock.org.uk/Home/Dioceses/Diocese-of-Nottingham/Lincoln-St-Hugh-of-Lincoln/ Lincoln - St Hugh of Lincoln] from [[English Heritage]], retrieved 20 December 2015</ref>\n\nIn 1874, owing to Dr Roskell's ill-health, the pope appointed the Rev. [[Edward Gilpin Bagshawe]] of the [[London Oratory]] his [[coadjutor]]. The same year, Dr Roskell tendered his resignation and Dr Bagshawe was consecrated at the [[London Oratory]] on 12 November 1874. Numerous missions necessitated by the development of the mining industry were opened during his administration, and communities of nuns introduced into the diocese, which he served for 27 years. He resigned in 1901 and in 1904 was transferred to the [[Titular see|titular Archbishopric of Seleucia]].\n\nThe Rt Rev. [[Robert Brindle]], Bagshawe's successor, was born at Liverpool on 4 November 1837. The first Roman Catholic chaplain to receive the pension for distinguished and meritorious service, as well as Turkish and Egyptian orders and medals, he was, after his retirement from the army in 1899, on the petition of [[Cardinal Herbert Vaughan]], third [[Archbishop of Westminster]], appointed his assistant, and on the resignation of Dr Bagshawe, received his Brief to the See of Nottingham on 6 November 1901.\n\nIn 1910 there were in the diocese 32,000 Catholics; 84 secular and 44 regular priests; 75 churches with missions attached, 31 without missions; 6 convents for men and 9 for women.\n\nIn 1980, 16 parishes were transferred to the [[Diocese of Hallam]]; this resulted in [[Bassetlaw District|Bassetlaw]] in Nottinghamshire and [[Chesterfield]] and parts of the [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]] in Derbyshire ceasing to be part of the diocese.\n\n==Bishops==\n\n===Past and Present Ordinaries===\n*[[Joseph William Hendren]], O.F.M.

He had been on the run in Tenerife for 20 years. The offences took place over a 34-year period from 1957 to 1991 and involved children aged from six to sixteen.<ref>The Times; 25 February 2014, page 14</ref>  A police spokesperson said that it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that Cullen had not abused more children during his time as a priest. During the court case the diocese insisted there were no records of anybody complaining to the Church at the time, however at least one victim said their parents did report the abuse to the Church.<ref>[http://www.nottinghampost.com/Hyson-Green-priest-Francis-Cullen-admits-sexually/story-20692367-detail/story.html Former Hyson Green priest Francis Cullen admits sexually abusing children] from ''[[Nottingham Post]]'', 24 February 2014, retrieved 1 May 2015</ref>\n\nIn 2011 the Diocesan Safeguarding Co-ordinator reported that there had been \"12 new concerns/allegations which needed to be dealt with\" during the previous year, and that he welcomed the paring back of a Government Vetting and Barring Scheme.<ref>[http://www.grasshopper-hosting.co.uk/Diocese/11_Commissions/Annual%20Reports%2010/2010%20Report%20to%20Inter%20Commisssions.pdf 2010 Annual Report to Inter Commissions Group from the Safeguarding Commission] from [http://www.grasshopper-hosting.co.uk/Diocese/11_Commissions/ Diocese of Nottingham archives] retrieved 14 May 2015</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*Notable churches in the diocese are listed at [[List of Roman Catholic churches in the United Kingdom#Nottingham]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Catholic|wstitle= Diocese of Nottingham\n}}\n\n==External links ==\n*[http://dioceseofnottingham.uk Diocese of Nottingham website]\n\n{{Roman Catholic dioceses in England and Wales}}\n\n{{coord|52.9545| -1.1572|region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Nottingham|Nottingham]]\n[[Category:Nottingham]]\n", "text_old": "{{Construction}}\n{{short description|Suffragan diocese of the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church in England}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox diocese\n| jurisdiction      = Diocese\n| name              = Nottingham\n| latin             = Dioecesis Nottinghamensis\n| local             = <!-- Name in the native language -->\n| image             = Diocese of Nottingham.png\n| image_size        = frameless\n| image_alt         =\n| caption           =\n<!---- Locations ---->\n| country           = [[England]]\n| territory         = Counties of Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham, Rutland and South Humberside except parts of the High Peak and Chesterfield district of Derby and the district of Bassetlaw in Nottingham.\n| province          = [[Province of Westminster|Westminster]]\n| metropolitan      = [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster|Diocese of Westminster]] \n| archdeaconries    =\n| deaneries         = 13\n| subdivisions      =\n| coordinates       = <!-- Use {{coord}} -->\n<!---- Statistics ---->\n| area_km2          = 13,000 <!-- Area in square kilometres, automatically converted -->\n| area_sqmi         = <!-- Area in square miles, automatically converted -->\n| population        = 4,500,000\n| population_as_of  = 2013\n| catholics         = 155,000\n| catholics_percent = 3.4\n| parishes          = 108<!-- Number of parishes in the diocese -->\n| churches          = <!-- Number of churches in the diocese -->\n| congregations     = <!-- Number of congregations in the diocese -->\n| schools           = <!-- Number of church supported schools in the diocese -->\n| members           = <!-- Number of members in the diocese -->\n<!---- Information ---->\n| denomination      = [[Roman Catholic]]\n| rite              = [[Latin Rite]]\n| established       =\n| cathedral         = [[Nottingham Cathedral]]\n| cocathedral       =\n| patron            = <!-- Patron saint(s) of the diocese (or archdiocese) -->\n| patron_title      = <!-- Use to override the default label \"Patron saint\" -->\n| priests           = 130<!-- Number of priests in the diocese -->\n<!---- Current leadership ---->\n| pope              = {{Incumbent pope}} <!-- DO NOT CHANGE.

The episcopal seat is the [[Nottingham Cathedral|Cathedral Church of St Barnabas]] in  [[Nottingham]]. \n\nThe Right Reverend [[Patrick McKinney]] is the 10th [[Bishop of Nottingham (Roman Catholic)|Bishop of Nottingham]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Nottingham Roman Catholic Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Nottingham Cathedral]]\nIt was one of twelve English dioceses created at the [[Universalis Ecclesiae|restoration of the hierarchy]] by [[Pius IX]] in 1850, embracing the counties of Nottingham, Leicester, Derby, Lincoln and Rutland. These had comprised part of the [[Apostolic Vicariate of the Midland District]], when at the request of [[James II of England|King James II]] in 1685, the Holy See divided England into four [[vicariate]]s: the London, the Northern, the Midland and the Western. Before 1840, when the number of vicars apostolic was increased from four to eight, the Midland District consisted of fifteen counties.<ref name=Croft>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11133a.htm Croft, William. \"Diocese of Nottingham.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 27 February 2019</ref>\n\nIn 1850 Nottingham had 24 permanent [[Mission (Christian)|mission]]s, many of these little better than villages. For the most part they originated from chaplaincies which had through penal times been maintained by the Catholic nobility and gentry, or had been founded independently by them. Among these there existed foundations of several religious orders. In Derbyshire the [[Jesuits]] had missions at [[Chesterfield]] and [[Church of the Immaculate Conception, Spinkhill|Spinkhill]], in Lincolnshire at Lincoln, Boston and [[Market Rasen]]. The [[Dominican Order]] was settled in [[Leicester]], the [[Fathers of Charity]] carried on several missions in Leicestershire, and the [[Cistercians]] occupied  [[Mount St Bernard Abbey]] in [[Charnwood Forest]].<ref name=Croft/>\n\nFrom the appearance of the Jesuits in England in 1580 at the special request of Dr [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Allen]], they had done much by their labours to keep alive the Catholic faith in the Nottingham diocese. Of their missions mentioned above some were among the earliest of the Society of Jesus in England dating back some three hundred years. Derby was included in the district or college of the Society called the \"Immaculate Conception\", founded by Father [[Richard Blount]], about 1633, first [[provincial superior]] of the English Province. Extinct for many years, it was partially revived in 1842 as [[Mount St Mary's College]], when the new college and ''convictus'' was established by the then provincial, Father Randall Lythgoe.<ref name=Croft/>\n\nAfter the Reformation, the English Province of the [[Friars Preachers]] ceased to exist, until resuscitated at [[Bornem]] in Flanders by [[Philip Howard (cardinal)|Philip Howard]], later cardinal, who became the first [[prior]] of the Dominicans in 1675. The first introduction of the English Dominicans from Bornem was at [[Hinckley]], whence for many years Leicester was served by them at intervals. Their mission at Leicester was put on a permanent basis in 1798 by the purchase of a house by Father Francis Xavier Choppelle. [[Holy Cross Priory, Leicester]] was begun by Father Benedict Caestryck in 1815 and was opened in 1819. The dedication under the title of [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]] was adopted on account of the celebrated relic of the Holy Cross brought from Bornem.\n\nAfter the lapse of three centuries a monastery of the Cistercian Order was resuscitated in England by the foundation of the [[Mount St Bernard Abbey|Abbey of Mount St Bernard]] in Leicestershire, made possible by the assistance of [[Ambrose Phillips de Lisle]] of [[Grace Dieu Manor]], who after his conversion in December 1825, devoted his energies to the spread of the Catholic faith in England by the re-establishment in the country of monastic institutions. In 1835 he purchased about {{convert|227|acre|km2}} of wild uncultivated land in Charnwood Forest and presented it to the [[Cistercians]].<ref>Purcell, Edmund Sheridan. ''Life and Letters of Ambrose Phillipps de Lisle'', p.66, Macmillan and Co., Ltd., London, 1900</ref> \n\nBeginning with one brother who lived alone in a four-roomed cottage, the community rapidly increased, and a larger building was erected as well as a small chapel, opened by Dr Walsh on 11 October 1837. In a short time this proved insufficient and [[John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury]] offered them \u00a32,000, on condition that a new monastery should be erected, choosing for that purpose the present site of the abbey. It was built from designs by [[Augustus Pugin]]. In 1848 by Papal Brief of [[Pius IX]] the monastery of Mount St Bernard was raised to the dignity of an abbey, and Father Bernard, the first [[mitred abbot]] in England since the Reformation, was consecrated on 18 February 1849.\n\nIn introducing the Cistercians into England, de Lisle had hoped that they would undertake missionary work and with this view he had built three chapels: at [[Grace-Dieu]], [[Whitwick]] and the abbey. On the score of their rule, they declined to take charge permanently of the missions. De Lisle then decided to bring from Italy members of the [[Institute of Charity]]. After much negotiation with the head of the order, [[Aloysius Gentili|Father Gentili]] came to Grace Dieu as chaplain. This was the commencement of the settlement of the Rosminians in the diocese. In 1841 Dr Walsh made over to them the secular mission of [[Loughborough]] founded in 1832 by Father Benjamin Hulme. The buildings were too small to permit of a [[novitiate]] and a college of their own which they were desirous to establish. To carry out this twofold object, about {{convert|9|acre|m2}} were purchased; the foundation stone of the new buildings was laid in May 1843 and in 1844 was opened the first college and novitiate house of the institute in England. The [[Sisters of Mercy]] had come to Nottingham in 1844, and in 1846 entered their convent in close proximity to the cathedral.\n\nThe first Bishop of Nottingham was the Rt Rev. [[Joseph William Hendren]], O.S.F. (born 1792), consecrated on 10 September 1848, as [[Vicar Apostolic]] of the Western District, transferred to the [[bishopric of Clifton]] on 29 September 1850, and to Nottingham on 22 June 1851. The cathedral church of St Barnabas, of the lancet style of architecture, is considered one of the best specimens of the work of Pugin.\n\nOwing to ill-health Dr Hendren resigned in 1853 and was succeeded by Dr [[Richard Roskell]], born at [[Gateacre]], near Liverpool, in 1817. He was sent to [[Ushaw College]] and afterwards to Rome, where he took his degree and was ordained in 1840. He was consecrated in the cathedral by Cardinal Wiseman on 21 September 1853. During his episcopate a number of missions were founded in the counties of the diocese. In Lincolnshire, through the generosity of Thomas Arthur Young of [[Kingerby Hall]], not only was there a church and presbytery built at [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and [[St Mary's Church, Grimsby|Grimsby]], but the [[Premonstratensian]] order was re-introduced into England at [[Crowle, Lincolnshire|Crowle]] and [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]]. Thomas Young also planned to build a church in Lincoln, but it was not until 1893 that [[St Hugh's Church, Lincoln]] was opened.<ref name=stock>[http://taking-stock.org.uk/Home/Dioceses/Diocese-of-Nottingham/Lincoln-St-Hugh-of-Lincoln/ Lincoln - St Hugh of Lincoln] from [[English Heritage]], retrieved 20 December 2015</ref>\n\nIn 1874, owing to Dr Roskell's ill-health, the pope appointed the Rev. [[Edward Gilpin Bagshawe]] of the [[London Oratory]] his [[coadjutor]]. The same year, Dr Roskell tendered his resignation and Dr Bagshawe was consecrated at the [[London Oratory]] on 12 November 1874. Numerous missions necessitated by the development of the mining industry were opened during his administration, and communities of nuns introduced into the diocese, which he served for 27 years. He resigned in 1901 and in 1904 was transferred to the [[Titular see|titular Archbishopric of Seleucia]].\n\nThe Rt Rev. [[Robert Brindle]], Bagshawe's successor, was born at Liverpool on 4 November 1837. The first Roman Catholic chaplain to receive the pension for distinguished and meritorious service, as well as Turkish and Egyptian orders and medals, he was, after his retirement from the army in 1899, on the petition of [[Cardinal Herbert Vaughan]], third [[Archbishop of Westminster]], appointed his assistant, and on the resignation of Dr Bagshawe, received his Brief to the See of Nottingham on 6 November 1901.\n\nIn 1910 there were in the diocese 32,000 Catholics; 84 secular and 44 regular priests; 75 churches with missions attached, 31 without missions; 6 convents for men and 9 for women.\n\nIn 1980, 16 parishes were transferred to the [[Diocese of Hallam]]; this resulted in [[Bassetlaw District|Bassetlaw]] in Nottinghamshire and [[Chesterfield]] and parts of the [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]] in Derbyshire ceasing to be part of the diocese.\n\n==Bishops==\n\n===Past and Present Ordinaries===\n*[[Joseph William Hendren]], O.F.M.
