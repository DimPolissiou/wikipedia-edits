[[Tibetan culture]] has been preserved by the relative isolation of the region from the outside world. Life in Mustang revolves around tourism, [[animal husbandry]] and trade.\n\nThe ''Upper Mustang'' comprise the northern two-thirds of [[Mustang District]] of [[Gandaki Pradesh]], [[Nepal]]. It consists of three rural municipalities namely [[Lo Manthang]], [[Dalome]], and [[Baragung Muktichhetra]].\n\nThe southern third of the district is called '''Thak''' and is the homeland of the [[Thakali people|Thakali]], who speak the [[Thakali language]], and whose culture combines Tibetan and [[Culture of Nepal|Nepalese]] elements. \n\nMustang's status as a kingdom ended in 2008 when its [[Suzerainty|suzerain]] [[Kingdom of Nepal]] became a [[republic]].

In the round of 16, Park's free kick just before halftime struck the left goal post. A late goal from [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] put [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] on top. The final score was 2\u20131 to Uruguay who then advanced to the quarter-finals in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] at the expense of South Korea.\n\n===2010 Asian Games===\nPark, along with [[Kim Jung-woo]], was called to the [[South Korea national under-23 football team|U-23 team]] to participate in the [[2010 Asian Games]] held in [[Guangzhou]]. The team was led by former national team captain [[Hong Myung-bo]]. Park did not play in the first game against [[North Korea national under-23 football team|North Korea]], which ended in a 0\u20131 loss.

In their next match against [[China national under-23 football team|China]], Park played the entire game, scoring a goal in the 50th minute to help South Korea to a 3\u20130 win. In the quarterfinal match against [[Uzbekistan national under-23 football team|Uzbekistan]], Park was once again influential in leading Korea to victory. Park scored his third goal of the tournament a few minutes into the first period of extra time, after the teams played to a 1\u20131 draw in normal time. South Korea eventually won the game 3\u20131, and Park was substituted in the 108th minute. Although Park played in the semifinal match against [[United Arab Emirates national football team|UAE]], he was unable to find the net and South Korea lost 0\u20131 after UAE scored in the last minute of extra time. In the bronze medal game against [[Iran national under-23 football team|Iran]], Park scored his fourth goal of the tournament. With South Korea trailing 3\u20131, Park tapped in the ball from a cross to bring the score to 3\u20132.

His performances were heavily criticized, particularly because he registered no shots on target in either match. He was replaced by [[Kim Shin-wook]] for the team's final match against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. However, it was later revealed that the manager of the team, [[Hong Myung-bo]], told him not to take shots but to open up space for offensive midfielders and make runs to score.
