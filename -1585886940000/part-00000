The school is part of the [[North Scott Community School District]], and has an enrollment of approximately 1,000 students in grades nine through 12.\n\nLocated at 200 South First Street in Eldridge (approximately one mile west of [[U.S. Highway 61]]), North Scott High School draws students from several communities in northern [[Scott County, Iowa]], including [[Eldridge, Iowa|Eldridge]], [[Dixon, Iowa|Dixon]], [[Donahue, Iowa|Donahue]], [[Long Grove, Iowa|Long Grove]], [[Maysville, Iowa|Maysville]], [[McCausland, Iowa|McCausland]], [[Park View, Iowa|Park View]], [[Princeton, Iowa|Princeton]] and surrounding rural areas.\n\n==History==\nNorth Scott High School was completed in 1958 at a cost of $1.2 million, and originally conceived as a junior-senior high facility. Prior to the school's opening, students living in what is now the North Scott School District completed their high school education at one of a number of area high schools \u2013 which included Clinton, Davenport (now [[Davenport Central High School|Davenport Central]]), LeClaire (now part of the [[Pleasant Valley Community School District]]), Wheatland (now Calamus-Wheatland) or DeWitt.\n\nJunior high students continued to attend the high school until 1975, when they were moved into the newly built North Scott Junior High School. The junior high building is located approximately one-quarter mile southwest of the high school campus.\n\nThe high school has undergone many renovations and additions during its 60-year history. One of the most notable projects was the multimillion-dollar fine arts [[auditorium]], a 900-seat venue that was opened in 1982; the auditorium was extensively remodeled in 2017 and 2018. The auditorium has served as the hub for the school's drama productions, music concerts and other meetings. The athletic lobby, cafeteria and administrative offices were also extensively remodeled twice, in 1983 and in 2015.\n\nOther additions through the years have included an auxiliary gymnasium, a special education wing, modern [[library|media center]] with computer labs (updated in the 2010s) and a science and music wing on the school's west end.\n\nIn August 2005, North Scott High School received an $800,000 Smaller Learning Communities Grant, which is aimed at assisting students during their high school years.\n\n==Fine arts==\nLancer Productions offers at least three shows a year with chances for students to participate on and off stage.  Troupe 739 in the International Thespian Society. Lancer Productions have performed at many State and International Thespian Festivals. They have performed many plays and musicals, including ''Schoolhouse Rock Live'', ''[[The Music Man]]'', ''A Piece of My Heart'', ''[[Dark of the Moon (play)|Dark of the Moon]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', ''[[Godspell]]'', ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (musical)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[Loving Lives]]'', and ''[[The Spitfire Grill (musical)]].\n\nThe music department has multiple choirs (including two jazz choirs), two jazz bands, two concert bands, a pit band, a marching band and an orchestra. North Scott's Jazz band has been the winner of many state contests, and its participants winners of many individual honors. On February 25, 2009, it was announced that Jazz I was one of fifteen high school jazz band finalists for the 14th annual [[Essentially Ellington]] competition and festival held at [[Lincoln Center]] in New York City each May.<ref>[http://www.jazzatlincolncenter.org/about/news/2007/pdf/2009-02-25_Essentially%20Ellington%20Finalists.pdf Jazzatlincolncenter.org]</ref>\n\nNorth Scott also has a state-honored speech team, which has had numerous students qualify for the [[Iowa High School Speech Association]]'s state competition in Ames, Iowa. Several Reader's Theatre and Ensemble Acting plays received Division I ratings, the highest honor possible, in all-state competition. The school's duet act for the play \"The Rabbit Hole\" featuring S. Phipps and N. Curlott (both Seniors) was selected as the best out of 800 in Iowa during the 2010 competition. In addition, B.

The school also has a cheerleading squad and a competitive dance team named the Silver Shakers.\n\nNorth Scott is classified as a 4A school (Iowa's largest 48 schools), according to the Iowa High School Athletic Association and Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union; in sports where there are fewer divisions, the Lancers are usually in the largest class (e.g., Class 3A for wrestling, boys soccer, and Class 2A for golf and tennis). Exceptions include football (where the Lancers are in Class 3A, the second-largest tier of schools per the IHSAA) and certain girls' sports, where North Scott is a 4A school in volleyball and girls' basketball, which have five classes, and is a 2A school in girls' soccer, which has three classes. The school is a member of the 10-team [[Mississippi Athletic Conference]] (known to locals as the MAC), which comprises schools from the Iowa [[Quad Cities]], along with Burlington, Clinton and Muscatine high schools.\n\nNorth Scott's boys program enjoys its biggest rivalries with MAC schools Bettendorf and Pleasant Valley.  The girls softball team had a long-standing (over 20 years) rivalry with Davenport West.\n\n===Successes===\nThroughout the school's history, North Scott has enjoyed great success in many of its sports, earning many MAC conference titles and producing all-state athletes that have enjoyed success at the collegiate level and in their careers.\n\nTo date, North Scott has had some very successful teams in many sports and have had several athletes have gone onto outstanding careers at NCAA Division I schools. Lancer softball teams have been to the IGHSAU-sponsored state tournament 12 times in 1987\u20132010, and produced five Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union Players of the Year, either overall or in their enrollment classification.\n\nNorth Scott's football teams have become a formidable force on the gridiron. After years of posting losing records since joining the MAC, the Lancers began showing improvement during the mid-1990s and broke through in 1999, obtaining an 8-1 regular season record, qualifying for the state playoffs for the first time, and producing two eventual all-American athletes at the collegiate level. The school won its first outright MAC championship in 2006, going undefeated during the nine-game regular season and being ranked No. 1 in the state by beating Bettendorf 17\u20130 in the final game of the regular season. Since 2002, the Lancers have gone 78-30, and continue to produce all-state performers.\n\nThe Lancer wrestling program won MAC conference titles in 2004, 2006 and 2017, and six individuals have won state championships, five of those coming since 2000. Meanwhile, the girls' soccer program began rising to prominence in the latter half of the 2000s, winning a state title in 2014 and making multiple state trips since 2012.\n\nIn addition to individual state championships in track (both boys and girls), girls' cross country and wrestling, the following teams have won either state titles or runner-up trophies:\n* '''Boys' basketball''': State runner-up \u2013 2003 (Class 4A); state champion - 2015 (Class 4A).\n* '''Girls' basketball''': State runner-up \u2013 1986 and 1987; state champions - 2017, 2019, and 2020 (Class 4A).\n* '''Indoor boys' track''': State championship \u2013 1962.\n* '''Softball''': State champions \u2013 1987, 1993 and 2002; the first two championships were in a single-class tournament, while the third was in Class 3A. State runner-up trophies were awarded in 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2019. National records: Lindsay Wood: career hits (420), and career runs (344). Longtime softball coach Dennis Johnson was elected to the National Softball Hall of Fame in 1998.\n* '''Girls' cross country''': State team championship in 1988, and state runner-up in 1984. State individual champion: Wendy Bare in 1984.\n* '''Girls' track and field''': State runner up 1985. State individual champions: Wendy Bare (3000 meters) 1985, Kim Schneckloth (800 meters and 1500 meters) 1985.\n* '''Volleyball''': State championship \u2013 1985. State runner-up \u2013 1986.\n*'''Silver Shakers \u2013 Dance Team''': State championship Pom \u2013 1996, 2006, 2015, 2016, 2017. State championship Lyrical - 2016, 2017. State championship Jazz 2017. State runner-up Jazz \u2013 2008, 2016. State runner-up Pom \u2013 2008.\n*'''Cheerleading''': State championship 2016\n\n===National History Day===\nThe [[National History Day]] program at North Scott High School is relatively new, but very successful. Within the past four years, participation from students in this program has grown exponentially. This effect is also shown in the junior high, most likely due to the new teacher, Mrs. Chris Green, for the program. North Scott is very successful in the regional competitions held at St. Ambrose University. From there, many students advance to the State competition held in Des Moines in early May of each year. North Scott has been very lucky with many opportunities each year to send many projects to compete nationally in [[Washington, D.C.]], each year in mid-June.\n\n==Famous alumni==\n* [[Beth Bader]] (class of 1992), professional golfer<ref>{{cite news|title=Bader LPGA bag will be auctioned|url=http://qctimes.com/sports/high-school/bader-lpga-bag-will-be-auctioned/article_87b68cd6-3838-51c5-871d-a66c1fe9dac5.html|accessdate=November 21, 2014|publisher=Quad City Times|date=January 30, 2003}}</ref>\n* [[Mike Busch (baseball)|Mike Busch]] (class of 1986), professional baseball player<ref>{{cite news|last1=Laxen|first1=Jacob|title=Baseball: Mike Busch, the Cyclones\u2019 Sultan of Swat|url=http://amestrib.com/sections/sports/isu-cyclones/baseball-mike-busch-cyclones%E2%80%99-sultan-swat.html|accessdate=November 21, 2014|publisher=Ames Tribune|date=April 4, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Keith Jansen]] (class of 1976), NS High School football standout, business professional at Mandus Group <ref>{{cite news|title=Mandus Group Artillery Solutions|url=http://www.mandusgroup.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hawkeye 105mm Howitzer|url=http://www.mandusgroup.com/hawkeye/}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.north-scott.k12.ia.us/hs/index.html NSHS Webpage] \u2013 The Web page for North Scott High School.\n* [http://www.north-scott.k12.ia.us/ North Scott School District Web site]\n\n{{Mississippi Athletic Conference |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1958]]\n[[Category:Public high schools in Iowa]]\n[[Category:Schools in Scott County, Iowa]]\n[[Category:1958 establishments in Iowa]]\n", "text_old": "{{coord|41.653|-90.584|region:US-IA_type:edu|display=title}}\n{{Infobox School\n| name = North Scott High School\n|superintendent = Joe Stutting\n| conference = [[Mississippi Athletic Conference]] \n| principal = Shane Knoche\n| type = [[Public education|Public]] [[Secondary education|Secondary]]\n| established = 1958\n| grades = 9\u201312\n| ratio = 15.45<ref name=NCES/>\n| staff = 62.85 (FTE)<ref name=NCES/>\n| enrollment = 971 (2017\u201318)<ref name=NCES>{{cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_detail.asp?Search=1&DistrictID=1920940&ID=192094001256|title=North Scott High School|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref>\n| enrollment_as_of = \n| colors = [[Scarlet (color)|Scarlet]] and [[Silver (color)|Silver]] {{Color box|#FF2400|border=darkgray}}{{Color box|silver|border=darkgray}}\n| address = 200 S.

The school is a member of the 10-team [[Mississippi Athletic Conference]] (known to locals as the MAC), which comprises schools from the Iowa [[Quad Cities]], along with Burlington, Clinton and Muscatine high schools.\n\nNorth Scott's boys program enjoys its biggest rivalries with MAC schools Bettendorf and Pleasant Valley.  The girls softball team had a long-standing (over 20 years) rivalry with Davenport West.\n\n===Successes===\nThroughout the school's history, North Scott has enjoyed great success in many of its sports, earning many MAC conference titles and producing all-state athletes that have enjoyed success at the collegiate level and in their careers.\n\nTo date, North Scott has had some very successful teams in many sports and have had several athletes have gone onto outstanding careers at NCAA Division I schools. Lancer softball teams have been to the IGHSAU-sponsored state tournament 12 times in 1987\u20132010, and produced five Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union Players of the Year, either overall or in their enrollment classification.\n\nNorth Scott's football teams have become a formidable force on the gridiron. After years of posting losing records since joining the MAC, the Lancers began showing improvement during the mid-1990s and broke through in 1999, obtaining an 8-1 regular season record, qualifying for the state playoffs for the first time, and producing two eventual all-American athletes at the collegiate level. The school won its first outright MAC championship in 2006, going undefeated during the nine-game regular season and being ranked No. 1 in the state by beating Bettendorf 17\u20130 in the final game of the regular season. Since 2002, the Lancers have gone 78-30, and continue to produce all-state performers.\n\nThe Lancer wrestling program won MAC conference titles in 2004, 2006 and 2017, and six individuals have won state championships, five of those coming since 2000. Meanwhile, the girls' soccer program began rising to prominence in the latter half of the 2000s, winning a state title in 2014 and making multiple state trips since 2012.\n\nIn addition to individual state championships in track (both boys and girls), girls' cross country and wrestling, the following teams have won either state titles or runner-up trophies:\n* '''Boys' basketball''': State runner-up \u2013 2003 (Class 4A); state champion - 2015 (Class 4A).\n* '''Girls' basketball''': State runner-up \u2013 1986 and 1987; state champions - 2017, 2019, and 2020 (Class 4A).\n* '''Indoor boys' track''': State championship \u2013 1962.\n* '''Softball''': State champions \u2013 1987, 1993 and 2002; the first two championships were in a single-class tournament, while the third was in Class 3A. State runner-up trophies were awarded in 2000, 2001 and 2003. National records: Lindsay Wood: career hits (420), and career runs (344). Longtime softball coach Dennis Johnson was elected to the National Softball Hall of Fame in 1998.\n* '''Girls' cross country''': State team championship in 1988, and state runner-up in 1984. State individual champion: Wendy Bare in 1984.\n* '''Girls' track and field''': State runner up 1985. State individual champions: Wendy Bare (3000 meters) 1985, Kim Schneckloth (800 meters and 1500 meters) 1985.\n* '''Volleyball''': State championship \u2013 1985. State runner-up \u2013 1986.\n*'''Silver Shakers \u2013 Dance Team''': State championship Pom \u2013 1996, 2006, 2015, 2016, 2017. State championship Lyrical - 2016, 2017. State championship Jazz 2017. State runner-up Jazz \u2013 2008, 2016. State runner-up Pom \u2013 2008.\n*'''Cheerleading''': State championship 2016\n\n===National History Day===\nThe [[National History Day]] program at North Scott High School is relatively new, but very successful. Within the past four years, participation from students in this program has grown exponentially. This effect is also shown in the junior high, most likely due to the new teacher, Mrs. Chris Green, for the program. North Scott is very successful in the regional competitions held at St. Ambrose University. From there, many students advance to the State competition held in Des Moines in early May of each year. North Scott has been very lucky with many opportunities each year to send many projects to compete nationally in [[Washington, D.C.]], each year in mid-June.\n\n==Famous alumni==\n* [[Beth Bader]] (class of 1992), professional golfer<ref>{{cite news|title=Bader LPGA bag will be auctioned|url=http://qctimes.com/sports/high-school/bader-lpga-bag-will-be-auctioned/article_87b68cd6-3838-51c5-871d-a66c1fe9dac5.html|accessdate=November 21, 2014|publisher=Quad City Times|date=January 30, 2003}}</ref>\n* [[Mike Busch (baseball)|Mike Busch]] (class of 1986), professional baseball player<ref>{{cite news|last1=Laxen|first1=Jacob|title=Baseball: Mike Busch, the Cyclones\u2019 Sultan of Swat|url=http://amestrib.com/sections/sports/isu-cyclones/baseball-mike-busch-cyclones%E2%80%99-sultan-swat.html|accessdate=November 21, 2014|publisher=Ames Tribune|date=April 4, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Keith Jansen]] (class of 1976), NS High School football standout, business professional at Mandus Group <ref>{{cite news|title=Mandus Group Artillery Solutions|url=http://www.mandusgroup.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hawkeye 105mm Howitzer|url=http://www.mandusgroup.com/hawkeye/}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.north-scott.k12.ia.us/hs/index.html NSHS Webpage] \u2013 The Web page for North Scott High School.\n* [http://www.north-scott.k12.ia.us/ North Scott School District Web site]\n\n{{Mississippi Athletic Conference |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1958]]\n[[Category:Public high schools in Iowa]]\n[[Category:Schools in Scott County, Iowa]]\n[[Category:1958 establishments in Iowa]]\n", "name_user": "Tom Barrister 2", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSuccesses:updated to reflect state runner-up finish in 2019", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Scott_High_School"}

[[Track and field|athlete]] from Switzerland competing in category [[T54 (classification)|T54]] wheelchair racing events. Hug, nicknamed 'The Silver Bullet', has competed in four [[Summer Paralympic Games]] for Switzerland, winning two bronze medals in his first Games in Athens in 2004. In 2010 he set four world records in four days, and at the 2011 World Championships he won a gold in the 10,000 metres and four silver medals, losing the gold in three events to long term rival [[David Weir (athlete)|David Weir]]. This rivalry continued into the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in London, where Hug won two silvers, in the 800m and the marathon. In the [[2013 IPC Athletics World Championships|2013 World Championships]] Hug dominated the field, winning five golds and a silver. During the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]] in Rio, Hug was one of the most consistent competitors in the T54 class, winning two golds, in the 800 m and marathon, and two silvers medals, in the 1500m and 500m.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzz.ch/sport/paralympics-marcel-hug-champion-von-rio-ld.117435|title=Marcel Hug, Champion von Rio|last=Wey|first=Alexandra|work=nzz.ch|access-date=18 September 2016|via=NZZ}}</ref>\n\nAs well as numerous World and European track medals, Hug is also a world class marathon athlete, winning the men's elite wheelchair event at the [[Berlin Marathon|Berlin]], ([[2011 Berlin Marathon|2011]], [[2012 Berlin Marathon|2012]]), [[New York City Marathon|New York City]] ([[2013 New York City Marathon|2013]], [[2016 New York City Marathon|2016]], [[2017 New York City Marathon|2017]]), [[London Marathon|London]] ([[2014 London Marathon|2014]], [[2016 London Marathon|2016]]), [[Chicago]] ([[2016 Chicago Marathon|2016]]), and [[Boston Marathon]]s ([[2015 Boston Marathon|2015]], [[2016 Boston Marathon|2016]], [[2017 Boston Marathon|2017]], [[2018 Boston Marathon|2018]]).\n\n==Career history==\n\n===Early career===\nHug was born in the municipality of [[Pfyn]] in Switzerland in 1986.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Swiss+silver+bullet.-a0302595333 |title=The Swiss silver bullet |accessdate=13 April 2014 |date=1 September 2012 |publisher=thefreelibrary.com |work=Swiss News |first=Carina |last=Scheuringer}}</ref> Born with [[spina bifida]], Hug grew up on a farm, the youngest of four brothers.<ref name=\"marcelhug\">{{cite web |url=http://www.marcelhug.com/d/biografie/ |title=Biography |publisher=marcelhug.com |accessdate=13 April 2014}}</ref> As a young child, he met Swiss wheelchair racer, and Hug's sporting idol, [[Franz Nietlispach]], beginning Hug's desire to take up athletics.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /> The ten-year-old Hug was introduced to racing when a sports teacher brought in an old racing wheelchair.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /> This led to Hug competing in his first wheelchair race that year, the 3&nbsp;km youth race which was part of the Schenkon Marathon.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /> Winning this event inspired him to take up wheelchair athletics and he joined the Swiss Paraplegic Centre in [[Nottwil]] where he teamed up with trainer Paul Odermatt.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /><ref name=\"marcelhug\" />\n\nThe following years saw Hug develop from a junior athlete into an elite racer and he began competing in both Switzerland and abroad.<ref name=\"marcelhug\" /> In 2001 he made the athletics team for Wheelchair Sport Switzerland (''Rollstuhlsport Schweiz''), and the same year he was accepted into the sports school at Kreuzlingen. Hug described the fact that he was the only wheelchair athlete at the school as being \"immensely important for my personal development.\"<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /> In 2002 Hug accepted a place at the Schule fur Beruf und Weiterbildung (School for Employment and Further Education) in [[Romanshorn]], believing that an education outside sport would be vital in his later life.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" />\n\n===Elite career===\nHug competed in his first world class international when he was selected to represent Switzerland at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] in Athens despite not being part of the national team setup. He took part in both men's wheelchair relay races the [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metre relay T53\u2013T54|4 \u00d7 100m T53\u2013T54]] and [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metre relay T53\u2013T54|4 \u00d7 400m T53\u2013T54]], although Switzerland failed to progress through to the finals in either events.

There he competed in four tracks events: the [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 400 metres T54|400m]], [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 800 metres T54|800m]], [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metres T54|1,500m]] and [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 5000 metres T54|5,000m]]; and the [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's marathon T54|marathon]]. By his own admission the games were a disappointment, as he failed to record a single podium finish, crashing out in both the 1,500m and the marathon.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /><ref name=\"IPC bio\" /> His fortunes changed over the next two years and this was highlighted by his results in the 2010 season. Between the 24 and 27 June 2010 Hug competed at a race meet in Switzerland. There he set new world records in four events in the T54 category: the 800m (1:31.12), 1,500m (2:54.51), 5,000m (9:53.05) and 10,000m (19:50.04).<ref name=\"IPC bio\" />\n\nThe next major competition for Hug was the [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championship]] held in Christchurch, New Zealand. Despite going into the Championship as the new world champion, David Weir, whose records Hug had broken in 2010, was also hitting form as he eyed the Paralympic finals in his home capital of London in 2012. Hug ambitiously entered all eight events available to him. He was disqualified from his less favoured sprint events, the [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100m]] and [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships \u2013 Men's 200 metres|200m]], but in the mid distance [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships \u2013 Men's 400 metres|400m]], he took the silver, finishing second to China's [[Liu Chengming]]. In the 800m, 1,500m and 5,000m Hug faced Weir in the finals, and was unable to beat his British rival, taking silver behind Weir in all three events. Hug was still able to leave the Championship with a gold when he took the 10,000m, but failed to complete the marathon.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /><ref name=\"IPC bio\" /> It was during these championships that Hug gained the nickname 'The Silver Bullet', given to him in reference to his trademark silver helmet that he wears when racing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.lyon-2013.com/call-him-king-hug/ |title=Call him King Hug ! |first=Renaud |last=Goude |accessdate=13 April 2014 |date=28 July 2013 |publisher=lyon-2013.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225020504/http://en.lyon-2013.com/call-him-king-hug/ |archivedate=25 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/feature/weir-i-d-put-money-marcel-hug-win-gold |title=Weir: I\u2019d put money on Marcel Hug to win gold |accessdate=13 April 2014 |date=5 July 2013 |publisher=paralympic.org}}</ref>\n\n2011 also saw Hug win his first major city marathon event when he came first in the [[2011 Berlin Marathon]].<ref name=\"nyrr\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nyrr.org/newsroom/press-release/world-champions-marcel-hug-and-manuela-sch%C3%A4r-join-new-york-city-marathon-wheelchair-field |title=World Champions Marcel Hug and Manuela Sch\u00e4r Join New York City Marathon Wheelchair Field |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2014 |publisher=nyrr.org}}</ref>\n[[File:London Marathon 2013 Men's Wheelchair.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hug, in his trademark silver helmet challenges David Weir at the [[2013 London Marathon]]]]\nThe 2011 World Championships set the scene for the build-up to the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]], held in London. Hug entered five events, reaching the finals in all of them. In the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 400 metres T54|400m]] he qualified in second place in his heat, but finished fifth in the final. In the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 800 metres T54|800m]] he came through his heat in second place to David Weir, and the result was repeated in the final, Hug taking silver to Weir's gold. In both the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metres|1,500m]] and [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 5000 metres|5,000m]] he finished just outside the medals in fourth place.<ref name=\"Infostrada bio\" /> In the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's marathon|marathon]], the final race of the Athletics program of the Paralympics, only a second separated Weir in gold, Hug in silver and Australia's [[Kurt Fearnley]] in bronze.

(classification)|T54]] wheelchair racing events. Hug, nicknamed 'The Silver Bullet', has competed in four [[Summer Paralympic Games]] for Switzerland, winning two bronze medals in his first Games in Athens in 2004. In 2010 he set four world records in four days, and at the 2011 World Championships he won a gold in the 10,000 metres and four silver medals, losing the gold in three events to long term rival [[David Weir (athlete)|David Weir]]. This rivalry continued into the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in London, where Hug won two silvers, in the 800m and the marathon. In the [[2013 IPC Athletics World Championships|2013 World Championships]] Hug dominated the field, winning five golds and a silver. During the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]] in Rio, Hug was one of the most consistent competitors in the T54 class, winning two golds, in the 800 m and marathon, and two silvers medals, in the 1500m and 500m.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzz.ch/sport/paralympics-marcel-hug-champion-von-rio-ld.117435|title=Marcel Hug, Champion von Rio|last=Wey|first=Alexandra|work=nzz.ch|access-date=18 September 2016|via=NZZ}}</ref>\n\nAs well as numerous World and European track medals, Hug is also a world class marathon athlete, winning the men's elite wheelchair event at the [[Berlin Marathon|Berlin]], ([[2011 Berlin Marathon|2011]], [[2012 Berlin Marathon|2012]]), [[New York City Marathon|New York City]] ([[2013 New York City Marathon|2013]], [[2016 New York City Marathon|2016]], [[2017 New York City Marathon|2017]]), [[London Marathon|London]] ([[2014 London Marathon|2014]], [[2016 London Marathon|2016]]), [[Chicago]] ([[2016 Chicago Marathon|2016]]), and [[Boston Marathon]]s ([[2015 Boston Marathon|2015]], [[2016 Boston Marathon|2016]], [[2017 Boston Marathon|2017]], [[2018 Boston Marathon|2018]]).\n\n==Career history==\n\n===Early career===\nHug was born in the municipality of [[Pfyn]] in Switzerland in 1986.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Swiss+silver+bullet.-a0302595333 |title=The Swiss silver bullet |accessdate=13 April 2014 |date=1 September 2012 |publisher=thefreelibrary.com |work=Swiss News |first=Carina |last=Scheuringer}}</ref> Born with [[spina bifida]], Hug grew up on a farm, the youngest of four brothers.<ref name=\"marcelhug\">{{cite web |url=http://www.marcelhug.com/d/biografie/ |title=Biography |publisher=marcelhug.com |accessdate=13 April 2014}}</ref> As a young child, he met Swiss wheelchair racer, and Hug's sporting idol, [[Franz Nietlispach]], beginning Hug's desire to take up athletics.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /> The ten-year-old Hug was introduced to racing when a sports teacher brought in an old racing wheelchair.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /> This led to Hug competing in his first wheelchair race that year, the 3&nbsp;km youth race which was part of the Schenkon Marathon.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /> Winning this event inspired him to take up wheelchair athletics and he joined the Swiss Paraplegic Centre in [[Nottwil]] where he teamed up with trainer Paul Odermatt.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /><ref name=\"marcelhug\" />\n\nThe following years saw Hug develop from a junior athlete into an elite racer and he began competing in both Switzerland and abroad.<ref name=\"marcelhug\" /> In 2001 he made the athletics team for Wheelchair Sport Switzerland (''Rollstuhlsport Schweiz''), and the same year he was accepted into the sports school at Kreuzlingen. Hug described the fact that he was the only wheelchair athlete at the school as being \"immensely important for my personal development.\"<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /> In 2002 Hug accepted a place at the Schule fur Beruf und Weiterbildung (School for Employment and Further Education) in [[Romanshorn]], believing that an education outside sport would be vital in his later life.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" />\n\n===Elite career===\nHug competed in his first world class international when he was selected to represent Switzerland at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] in Athens despite not being part of the national team setup.

There he took his first major international gold medal when he won the men's 10,000m in the T54 (23:06.71). He collected a further three medals at the games, silvers in the 400m (48.97), 800m (1:39.10) and 5,000m (11:20.68).<ref name=\"Infostrada bio\">{{cite web |url=http://ipc.infostradasports.com/asp/lib/theasp.asp?pageid=8937&sportid=513&personid=688389&refreshauto=1 |title=Hug, Marcel |accessdate=13 April 2014 |publisher=ipc.infostradasports.com}}</ref> In the 400m he lost the gold to British racer [[David Weir (athlete)|David Weir]], beginning a rivalry between the two athletes that would define many of their races on the track and in marathons over the following years.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /><ref name=\"IPC bio\" />\n\nIn 2008 Hug travelled to Beijing with the Swiss team to compete in the [[2008 Summer Paralympics|Summer Paralympics]]. There he competed in four tracks events: the [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 400 metres T54|400m]], [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 800 metres T54|800m]], [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metres T54|1,500m]] and [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 5000 metres T54|5,000m]]; and the [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's marathon T54|marathon]]. By his own admission the games were a disappointment, as he failed to record a single podium finish, crashing out in both the 1,500m and the marathon.<ref name=\"Scheuringer\" /><ref name=\"IPC bio\" /> His fortunes changed over the next two years and this was highlighted by his results in the 2010 season. Between the 24 and 27 June 2010 Hug competed at a race meet in Switzerland. There he set new world records in four events in the T54 category: the 800m (1:31.12), 1,500m (2:54.51), 5,000m (9:53.05) and 10,000m (19:50.04).<ref name=\"IPC bio\" />\n\nThe next major competition for Hug was the [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championship]] held in Christchurch, New Zealand. Despite going into the Championship as the new world champion, David Weir, whose records Hug had broken in 2010, was also hitting form as he eyed the Paralympic finals in his home capital of London in 2012. Hug ambitiously entered all eight events available to him.

Gray]], 1869</small>\n}}\n\nThe '''yellow-faced honeyeater''' (''Caligavis chrysops'') is a small to medium-sized bird in the [[honeyeater]] [[family (biology)|family]], Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be [[contact call]]s, are animated two-note calls variously described as ''terric, terric'', ''cr-rook, cr-rook'' or ''put-put, put-put''.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Yellow-faced Honeyeater callistemon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower|The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs.]]\n\n===Habitat===\nAcross its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitats\u2014in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied.

The results of the field experiment did not support the \"[[ecological trap]]\" and \"predator influx\" theories and contribute to a belief that [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] may not be as problematic as previously thought.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Do yellow-faced honeyeater (''Lichenostomus chrysops'') nests experience higher predation at forest edges? |last1=Boulton | first1=R.L. | last2=Clarke | first2=M.F. | journal =Wildlife Research | year= 2003 |volume=30| issue=2| pages=119\u2013125 | doi=10.1071/WR02055}}</ref><!-- cites prev 3 sentences --> In some areas the species is considered a pest because of its intrusion into orchards and urban gardens where it damages fruit.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book |last=Beruldsen |first=Gordon |authorlink=Gordon Beruldsen |year=1980 |title=A Field Guide to Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds |location=Adelaide, S.A. |publisher=Rigby |isbn=978-0-7270-1202-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Higgins |first=Peter |first2=J.

The club has competed in the [[National Rugby League]] since [[NRL season 1999|1999]] after a joint-venture was formed between the [[St. George Dragons]] (est. 1921) and the [[Illawarra Steelers]] (est. 1982).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Warne-Smith |first=Drew |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/saints-face-test-with-nerves-of-steelers/story-e6frg7mf-1225933040209 |title=Saints face test with nerves of Steelers |date=2 October 2010 |work=[[The Australian]] |access-date=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120914083856/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/saints-face-test-with-nerves-of-steelers/story-e6frg7mf-1225933040209 |archive-date=14 September 2012}}</ref> They officially formed as the game's first joint-venture club on 23 September 1998 and remain the only cross-city team in the NRL.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wilson |first=Andy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/03/wigan-st-helens-super-league-grand-final |title=Wigan prepare to slay Dragons after crushing St Helens in Grand Final |date=3 October 2010 |work=guardian.co.uk |access-date=24 July 2011}}</ref> The team has its headquarters and leagues clubs in both [[Wollongong]] and the Sydney suburb of [[Kogarah, New South Wales|Kogarah]], and train and play games regularly at [[Wollongong Showground|WIN Stadium]] in Wollongong, as well as at [[Jubilee Oval]] in Kogarah. From 2006 to 2018 the club was jointly owned by the St. George Dragons 50%, Illawarra Steelers 25% and [[WIN Corporation]] 25%. In August 2018 WIN Corporation purchased the Illawarra Steelers remaining 25% stake.\n\nThe Dragons reached the [[grand final]] in their first season in [[1999 NRL season|1999]], losing to the [[Melbourne Storm]]. St. George Illawarra are one of only two clubs (the other being the [[Sydney Roosters]] in 1908) to finish runners-up in their inaugural season. The St. George Illawarra Dragons also field teams in local competitions within the [[St George, New South Wales|St. George]] and [[Illawarra]] regions. In 2010, the Dragons won their second successive minor premiership and became the first team to be awarded the [[J. J. Giltinan Shield]] in consecutive years since the [[National Rugby League]] was formed in 1998.\n\nThe Dragons won the [[2010 NRL Grand Final]] against the [[Sydney Roosters]], defeating them 32\u20138 at [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]], [[Sydney]]. They then won the [[2011 World Club Challenge]], defeating the [[Wigan Warriors]] 21\u201315 at [[DW Stadium]] in the UK. With its [[World Club Challenge]] victory, the club became the first Australian team since the [[Brisbane Broncos]] in 1992-3 to win the minor premiership, premiership and World Club Challenge simultaneously.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|St. George Dragons|Illawarra Steelers}}\nIn the wake of the [[Super League war]] of the mid-1990s, and the resulting [[Australian Rugby League season 1997|split competition of 1997]], the [[Illawarra Steelers]] found themselves struggling financially and seemed unlikely to survive past 1999. The [[St. George Dragons]] largely financed a proposal for a joint venture which would see the St George Illawarra Dragons playing in both Kogarah and Wollongong. Essentially, St George would provide the money while Illawarra would provide a broader junior and fan base. With the NRL's intention to rationalise the competition from 20 teams down to 14 teams and with a $4M incentive and a relaxing of salary cap requirements for a joint venture, the Dragons and the Steelers ensured their survival by forming the League's first joint venture on 23 September 1998.<ref>{{Cite news\n  | title = NRL predicts more teams to seek $4m merger bonus\n  | work = [[Illawarra Mercury]]\n  | place = Australia\n  | page = 44\n  | publisher = [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]]\n  | date = 29 September 1998\n  | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news980930_0130_6398\n  | accessdate = 13 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===David Waite and Andrew Farrar (1999\u20132002)===\nA joint venture entity being a new concept in Australian rugby league, the public watched closely in anticipation of success or failure. No-one was certain how the top players sourced from the two clubs would perform when they ran out onto the field. They were unsuccessful in their first outing, losing to the [[Parramatta Eels]] 20\u201310, but by the 4th round they had started to form some cohesion and would go on to achieve a top eight position on the competition ladder by the end of the regular season. In the semi-finals the Dragons won against the [[Melbourne Storm]] at Olympic Park, before returning to Sydney to dispose of the [[Sydney Roosters]] and the [[Cronulla Sharks]] to reach the Grand Final.\n\nIn the 1999 Grand Final the Dragons were leading by 14\u20130 at the break in front of a world record crowd of 107,999. A fairytale of a title in their first year as a joint venture seemed destined to come true; something of an advertisement to any other clubs considering the option of a joint venture, but the Storm recovered from their poor start and went into the final minutes of the game with the Dragons leading by 18\u201312. The Dragons were forced to perform a drop kick from their own goal line, and on the fifth tackle [[Brett Kimmorley]] kicked high towards the Dragon's corner of the field. As the Storm's winger Craig Smith caught the ball over the goal-line he was knocked unconscious in a tackle by [[Jamie Ainscough]] and lost the ball. Referee [[Bill Harrigan]] deferred to the [[video referee]] who ruled a penalty try on the grounds that contact had been made with the head, giving Melbourne a 20\u201318 lead and the premiership title.\n\nIn the 2000 season though they had a rough start, and in Round 5, the Dragons recorded their worst defeat for the club, losing 70\u201310 against the [[Melbourne Storm]]. This was the first game these two teams played against each other since the 1999 grand final, and was played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. On 3 May to the surprise and shock of fans and club officials, [[Anthony Mundine]] announced his retirement from the club and rugby league in general with immediate effect to pursue a career in [[boxing]]. The Dragons were not going well in the first half of the 2000 season, and the main coach [[David Waite]] was replaced with assistant coach, [[Andrew Farrar]]. Soon after the replacement of coaches, the Dragons recorded their best ever win. They defeated the [[New Zealand Warriors]] 54\u20130 in round 14 at WIN Stadium, with debutant [[Amos Roberts]] scoring a record 22 points (one try and nine goals) for any first grade player on debut. The Dragons, however, missed out of the finals series, and came 9th. Despite their poor season, [[Trent Barrett]] was awarded with the [[Dally M Medal]].\n\n===Nathan Brown (2003\u20132008)===\nIn 2003, Nathan Brown, the joint venture's first number 9 achieved the position of coach, becoming the youngest non-playing coach in premiership history at the age of 29. The Dragons finished the season 10th. Nathan Brown was also involved in a sideline incident when he had slapped Trent Barrett in Wollongong during a game against Manly, and was issued a $5000 fine.\n\n2004 saw the final season of the try scoring talent [[Nathan Blacklock]]. An extraordinary scoreline was seen in the round 25 clash with Manly. Trailing 34\u201310 after 53 minutes the Dragons came back to win the match 36\u201334. This was the second biggest comeback in Australian Rugby League history. Finishing 5th, the Dragons were eliminated in the first round of the finals after losing in a thrilling game 30\u201331 to 4th placed Penrith.\n\nIn 2005, after their worst start to a season yet (losing 5 of their first 6 games), the St. George Illawarra side finished second in a close season on the ladder at completion of the 2005 season, just behind minor premiers the [[Parramatta Eels]] on points difference. After progressing to the finals they defeated local rivals the [[Cronulla Sharks]] 28\u201322 in the quarter final of the finals series though the Dragons eventually fell 12\u201320 to eventual champions the [[Wests Tigers]] in the Preliminary Final. The Dragons broke the ground record at [[WIN Stadium]] twice in the 2005 season. First against rivals the [[Sydney Roosters]] and then at their home quarter final game against the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]].\n\nIn early 2006, WIN Television Network bought a 25% stake in the Illawarra Steelers Club for $6.5 million, erasing most of the debt Illawarra had to St. George. This formalised the strong support the network has shown for the Steelers in years gone by and ensured that Wollongong continued to host world class rugby league matches.\n\nAfter a bad start to the 2006 season, the Dragons put on a midseason 7-game winning streak. This was followed by a form slump, with a record five consecutive losses, only to return to form with a victory over the [[Wests Tigers|Tigers]], and continue this positive form leading into the finals. The Dragons ended the regular season in sixth position.\n\nIn the finals campaign, St George Illawarra faced the [[Brisbane Broncos]] at [[Suncorp Stadium]] in the first round, the Dragons won the game 20\u20134. In the second round, they met the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] winning 28\u20130. In the grand final qualifier, they played the [[Melbourne Storm]], where the Dragons went down 24\u201310 bowing out of season 2006. The Dragons can take solace from the fact that they did defeat the eventual premiers, Brisbane, three times during the 2006 season&nbsp;\u2013 26\u201312 at Wollongong in Round 4, 18\u201316 at Suncorp Stadium in Round 15 and the aforementioned qualifying final match.\n\nSeason 2007 saw an early injury to [[Mark Gasnier]] in the [[Rugby League Charity Shield (Australia)|Charity Shield]] match against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] creating another poor start for the Dragons. Combined with the loss of key players such as [[Luke Bailey (rugby league)|Luke Bailey]], [[Trent Barrett]] and [[Shaun Timmins]] in the off-season, the Dragons faced NRL newcomers, the [[Gold Coast Titans]], in Round 1. The Dragons won the historic match 20\u201318, however lost 6 more matches after that leaving the Dragons sitting in 15th place on the NRL Ladder. This was a very inexperienced Dragons team that seemed destined for a poor injury plagued season. However, in Round 17 (vs [[Canberra Raiders]] at [[WIN Stadium]]), the Dragons scored four times more points than their previous game average, winning the match 58\u201316, equalling their highest ever score and their largest victory in three years. The Dragons season ended with a 28\u201324 loss to the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] at Brookvale Oval, finishing in 13th place, their lowest finish to date.\n\n2008 saw the end of an era, with coach [[Nathan Brown (rugby league born 1973)|Nathan Brown]]'s contract not renewed after yet another poor start to the season, winning 1 of their first 6 matches. The club received a boost in May when former dual-code international player [[Wendell Sailor]] joined the team. Several notable players departed at the end of the year including [[Jason Ryles]]<ref>{{Cite news |last=Webster |first=Andrew |url=http://illawarra.yourguide.com.au/news/local/sport/rugby-league/ryles-quits-dragons/794116.aspx |title=Ryles quits Dragons |date=21 June 2008 |work=[[Illawarra Mercury]] |access-date=21 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712135145/http://illawarra.yourguide.com.au/news/local/sport/rugby-league/ryles-quits-dragons/794116.aspx |archive-date=12 July 2012}}</ref> and captain [[Mark Gasnier]]. The Dragons finished the season in 7th place, however they lost in the first round of the finals to eventual premiers [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] (whom they defeated 20\u201318 in round 11) 34\u20136 at [[Brookvale Oval]] ending yet another disappointing season. The era under Brown was one of frustration for Dragons fans, as there were high expectations for the strong side, but ultimately no premierships.\n\n===Wayne Bennett (2009\u20132011)===\n2009, a new season a new coach and ground sponsor WIN at Jubilee Oval. Several new faces joined the club, including Jeremy Smith, Darius Boyd, Neville Costigan, Michael Weyman and Luke Priddis. The season opener against the Storm ended in a thrilling golden point extra time loss (17\u201316). Round 3 set a new crowd record with the victorious return to WIN Jubilee against Cronulla.\n\nThey were consistently placed first on the competition ladder in 2009, contributed by a continuous winning streak of seven games since their win against the North Queensland Cowboys on 14 June. They lost first position after a three-game losing streak while the Canterbury Bulldogs won all games in that period, but remain in the top three. However, in the final round of the 2009 regular season, St. George Illawarra defeated in-form Parramatta Eels 37\u20130, a game in which winger Brett Morris obtained a hat-trick and man of the match honours, while the Bulldogs lost 34\u201312 to the Wests Tigers. In the same game, St. George Illawarra five-eighth [[Jamie Soward]] surpassed [[Harry Bath]]'s record for most points in a season by a St. George player. As a result, the Dragons won the minor premiership for the 2009 and Wayne Bennett's first season at the club, but the team was eliminated from the finals after losing both their finals matches, therefore becoming the first minor premiers since 1993. In the first match they were humbled in front of a packed Jubilee Stadium, before travelling to face Bennett's former team. The Broncos defeated the Dragons. Season 2010 saw the club lose seven matches&nbsp;\u2013 the same tally as in the 2009 home-and-away season, against eventual wooden spooners the Melbourne Storm, 2008 premiers the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, their perennial bogey team the Canberra Raiders, 2003 premiers the [[Penrith Panthers]] in round 17, the [[Gold Coast Titans]] in extra time in round 20, Bennett's old team the Brisbane Broncos in round 21 and a second time to the [[Canberra Raiders]] in round 24. The team has been placed first since round five.\n\nThe team won its second minor premiership in succession (the first NRL team to do so since the inception of the NRL in 1998) with victory against the Newcastle Knights in the penultimate round of the [[2010 NRL season]]. The Dragons had led the competition from round five right through to the final round, spending 21 consecutive weeks on top of the ladder and therefore spending the longest period of time on top of the ladder in NRL history (not including the Melbourne Storm).\n\nSt George Illawarra met Manly in the first week of the 2010 finals and produced a 28\u20130 victory. The Dragons then defeated [[Wests Tigers]] 13\u201312 with [[Jamie Soward]] kicking the winning field goal for a place in the [[2010 NRL Grand Final]].\n\nIn the [[2010 NRL Grand Final]], St. George Illawarra defeated the [[Sydney Roosters]] 32\u20138, to secure the club's first grand final victory. The Dragons overcame a poor first half performance to pull a thrilling victory out of the hat. This victory made Wayne Bennett's grand final record at 7 wins from 8 and thus continuing Brian Smith's poor grand final record of 4 losses from 4. [[Darius Boyd]] won a premiership with Bennett and the Brisbane Broncos in 2006, won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground in the match.  The Grand Final victory also ended 31 years of hurt for St. George fans as the club had lost previous finals in 1985, 1992, 1993, 1996 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-10-03/dragons-romp-to-sweet-16th/2283388/|title=Dragons romp to sweet 16th|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref>\n\nSt George Illawarra began their 2011 Season with pre-season wins in trials over Canterbury and South Sydney in the Charity Shield. The club also claimed its first [[World Club Challenge]] Championship, defeating [[Wigan Warriors]] 21\u201315 at [[DW Stadium]]. As of Round 14 2011, the Dragons have won 10 straight (excluding a 14\u201314 draw against Parramatta in Round 13).\n\nIt was announced in March 2011 that Bennett would leave St. George after the 2011 season, signing a four-year deal with the [[Newcastle Knights]] from the 2012 season onwards. Steve Price was named as his successor.\n\n===Steve Price and Paul McGregor (2012 \u2013 present)===\n[[File:Dragons cheerleaders.jpg|thumb|right|The club's cheersquad, The Flames, performing during the Dragons' Anzac Day match against the Roosters in 2018.]]\n2012 saw the club with a new coach. The Dragons narrowly missed out on a Finals spot, finishing up in 9th position. Several notable players departed from the club at the end of the season, including [[Ben Hornby]] and [[Dean Young (rugby league)|Dean Young]], who both retired from the sport. The start of the 2013 season saw the arrival of few key acquisitions, namely Gerard Beale from the Broncos and [[Tyson Frizell]] from the Cronulla Sharks. The season was plagued by inconsistent form, alongside injuries and speculation regarding Price's future at the club. After winning three straight matches on the lead up to the annual Anzac Day clash with the Roosters, it was announced that Price would be signed for another year with an option for a second at the clubs disposal. Despite the clubs faith in Price as well as the arrival of star fullback [[Josh Dugan]] from Canberra \u2013 in a mid-season transfer, the club was unable to string together consistent performances and finished the year at 14th position.\n\nStar five-eighth [[Gareth Widdop]] joined the club for 2014, but by late May 2014, just after the star signing of [[Benji Marshall]], the board sacked Price as coach due to some embarrassing defeats to start the season. Assistant coach [[Paul McGregor (rugby league)|Paul McGregor]] was named as his replacement until the end of the season, and was eventually employed full-time following improved results. This culminated in the club returning to the finals in [[2015 NRL season|2015]] and enjoying a successful year.\n\nIn the 2017 NRL Season, St George lead the competition after the first eight rounds before a dramatic slide which saw the club record only six wins for the rest of the season.

The merged entity's logo was taken directly from that of St George, with the addition of \"Illawarra\" to the bottom of the emblem. The emblem reflected the rich history of the St George Dragons, including an incredible 11 consecutive premierships, and the future strength of the club with the Illawarra.\n\nThe club name Dragons, is a shortened version of \"Dragonslayers\", the original nickname of St George. The emblem features a red shield with a silhouette of [[St. George]], overlaid with a white stylised [[Dragon]], with the words \"ST. GEORGE\" and \"ILLAWARRA\" above and below the shield respectively. It was originally intended for St George to face right and the Dragon to face left.\n\n===Jerseys===\nWhen the St George Illawarra Dragons were formed in 1998, it was decided that the jersey of St George (first used in 1945), the famous \"Red V\" on white, would become the main jersey for the new club. The red used was changed to the scarlet tone used by the Steelers.\n\nThe alternate jersey initially used by the club was red and white horizontal stripes, similar to the 1921 St George Jersey known as the \"blood and bandages\". Since 2006, this Jersey has been reserved for use as the St George Illawarra Heritage Jersey for special occasions. This Jersey is worn during [[NRL Heritage Round|Heritage Round]], when the Dragons confront fierce local rivals the [[Bulldogs RLFC]].\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, the club used a jersey similar to the Steelers main jersey for Heritage matches, acknowledging the rugby league history of the Illawarra region, though not as a full-time alternate strip. This jersey was predominantly red with white stripes on the sleeves. With [[Adidas]] producing the club's official merchandise from 2006, a generic Adidas design&nbsp;\u2013 predominantly red with three white stripes down the sleeves&nbsp;\u2013 was adopted as the full-time alternate strip; before another re-design in 2008, which better reflected the old Steelers jersey.\n\nReebok produced supporter and team kits from the 2010 season. Again the Red V was the Main jersey and the Alternate jersey was a red design with white slash marks. [[XBlades]] became the main jersey supplier for the 2018 season and onwards.\n\n<gallery perrow=\"4\" align=\"center\" caption=\"St George Illawarra \u2013 Jerseys\">\nImage:St. George Illawarra Dragons home jersey 1999.svg|Main Jersey (1999\u2013)\n</gallery>\n\n==Home grounds==\n[[Image:OKI Jubilee Grandstand.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Inside Jubilee Oval]]\n[[File:WIN Stadium5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Inside WIN Stadium]]\nThe Dragons have two home grounds, reflecting the joint nature of the club:\n\n* [[WIN Stadium]] (1999\u2013present)\n* [[Jubilee Oval]] (1999, 2003\u201307, 2009\u2013present)\n\nHalf of the Dragons home matches are played at [[WIN Stadium]] (previously the home ground of the Illawarra Steelers) and the half at [[Jubilee Oval]] (previously the home of the St George Dragons).\n\nThe club has previously played Sydney home games out of the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] (2000\u20132002) and [[Stadium Australia]] (2008), as well as the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] on special occasions.\n\nThe club has taken their home ground advantage away from their usual home grounds to the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] for the [[Club ANZAC Game]] against the [[Sydney Roosters]] in the 2004, 2006, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018 seasons. In 2002 when the match was first held, the Sydney Football Stadium was, at the time, one of the Dragons' main home grounds, whilst in 2008 the match was played at ANZ Stadium, a very unpopular move amongst supporters.\n[[Image:CarltonStadium.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Outside Jubilee Oval, that includes a Walk of Fame]]\n\n=== Right Game Right Venue Strategy ===\n\nIn 2013, the club entered into a four-year agreement with the NRL to move 4 of their 12 home games to one of the major Sydney stadiums (Allianz Stadium, Sydney Cricket Ground, ANZ Stadium).\n\nThe strategic intent was to replicate the success of the annual game played against Sydney Roosters on ANZAC day. As part of this initiative, the club and the NRL sought to introduce an annual Heritage Round game against South Sydney at the SCG.\n\nIn 2017, the club announced that the NRL had only provided three appropriate games to support this initiative for the 2017 season.\n\nIt was announced that from the 2018 NRL season that all games (except for the ANZAC clash Vs the [[Sydney Roosters]] and one other round) would be shared equally between Kogarah and Wollongong.\n\n{{-}}\n'''Stadium records'''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Highest Attendances at WIN Jubilee Oval'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, after a major restructure of its operations, the Steelers Club has trading profitably over the last 12 months.{{when|date=July 2012}}{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Twenty percent of the club premises were sold to Bermuda-based Billionaire and owner of WIN Corp, [[Bruce Gordon (businessman)|Bruce Gordon]].

The St. George Illawarra Dragons also have a huge following in south-east Queensland, as a significant number of the club's 'Red V' memberships are from people in this area. The Dragons also have a large number of supporters from all over NSW, with the club receiving record crowds at away games at [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]] (Stadium Australia) at [[Sydney Olympic Park]]. Some notable supporters of the team include [[Sally Fitzgibbons]], [[John Stanley (radio broadcaster)|John Stanley]], [[Dave Gleeson]], [[Morris Iemma]], [[Graham Richardson]], [[Barrie Unsworth]], [[Ian McNamara]], [[Stephanie Magiros]], [[Josh Hazlewood]], [[Moises Henriques]], [[Bryan Brown]], [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]], [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], [[Kerry O'Keeffe]], [[Mitchell Starc]], [[Matthew Jurman]], [[Billy Dib]], [[Jihad Dib]], [[Melissa Perrine]], [[Tony Squires]], [[Lara Pitt]], [[Ken Rosewall]], [[Geoff Harvey]], [[Michael Dalton (rugby league)|Mike Dalton]], [[Drew Morphett]], [[Matt Moran]], [[Stephen Jones (Australian politician)|Stephen Jones]], [[Graham Perrett]], [[John Hewson]], [[John Howard]],<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26177004-601,00.html |title=Former PM John Howard sounded out to overhaul rugby league, chair commission |date=2009-10-07 |work=[[The Australian]] |access-date=2009-10-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009081458/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26177004-601,00.html |archive-date=2009-10-09 |publisher=[[News Limited]]}}</ref> [[Mark Latham]]<ref name=\"Dodson\">{{cite news | last=Dodson | first=Louise |title=Latham has a stack of influential support | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=Fairfax Digital |date = 2004-08-24 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/23/1093246444388.html |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref> [[Robert McClelland (Australian politician)|Robert McClelland]]<ref name=\"Dodson\" /> and [[Brett Lee]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lee |first=Brett |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/04/1064988454362.html |title=Bat and ball?

The Bulldogs were founded in 1935, 14 years after St George. St. George inflicted a RL record 91\u20136 defeat of Canterbury in 1935 but Canterbury enjoyed premiership success first, however St. George recorded 11 straight premierships in the years following (1955\u20131966). It was also the Bulldogs who put an end to their Premiership run in 1967, when the Bulldogs beat them by 1 point in the preliminary final to face the Rabbitohs in the Grand Final. Since then, both clubs have inflicted Premiership defeats on the other, St George defeating the Bulldogs in 1979, Canterbury returning the favour in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rl1908.wordpress.com/Clubs/Canterbury-Bulldogs.htm |title=Canterbury Bulldogs |last=Fagan |first=Sean |website=RL1908.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601140655/http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Canterbury-Bulldogs.htm |archive-date=1 June 2009}}</ref> The two sides are rivals in the [[NRL Heritage Round]]. The Bulldogs and the Dragons also unofficially have a territorial rivalry, with fans from both teams coming in large amounts around [[Arncliffe, New South Wales|Arncliffe]], [[Earlwood]], [[Kingsgrove, New South Wales|Kingsgrove]], [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]], and [[Panania]].\n\n===Parramatta Eels===\nThe St. George Illawarra Dragons and Parramatta Eels rivalry stretched back to 1977 when the St. George Dragons and Parramatta played out the first ever drawn Grand Final result. Parramatta, seeking their first minor premiership after they finished the season on the top of the ladder at the end of the regular season, were beaten 22-0 in the Grand Final Rematch by St. George, who won their first Grand Final since 1966.\n\nThere were many controversial matches between the St. George Illawarra Dragons and the Parramatta Eels. Firstly, in Round 18 2005, the Parramatta Eels won 40-14 in a match which saw [[Trent Barrett]] and [[PJ Marsh]] trade blows after Marsh\u2019s crude charge-down attempt at Barrett, sparking an all-in brawl whitest, the Eels' [[Wade McKinnon]] sprinted to score a match-turning 80 metre try.\n\nA less memorable match saw no points scored between the two teams in Round 13 2006 in the first 70 minutes of play before the Eels slotted a field goal with nine minutes remaining, before the Dragons struck back with two one-pointers to take a 2-1 lead. The Dragons then scored a try through [[Matt Cooper (rugby league)|Matt Cooper]] with mere seconds remaining on the clock to claim an 8-1 victory.\n\nIn the 2009 NRL Finals Series, The St. George Illawarra Dragons finished as the Minor Premiership and faced the Parramatta Eels who finished 8th on the ladder, A week earlier at the same venue, St. George Illawarra had defeated Parramatta 37-0 but in the finals game, Parramatta won 25-12 with Parramatta player [[Jarryd Hayne]] scoring a brilliant solo try. As of the [[2019 NRL season]], this has been the last time where St. George Illawarra and Parramatta have met in a finals series.\n\n===Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks===\nSt George Illawarra's fiercest rivalries is with their Southern neighbour, [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]]. The Sharks originally were part of the St George juniors area, and the Sharks are often referred \nto as St George's \"little brother\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Cronulla-Sharks.htm |title=Cronulla Sharks |last=Fagan |first=Sean |website=RL1908.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830112321/http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Cronulla-Sharks.htm |archive-date=30 August 2009}}</ref> The Dragons have had the same amount of success as the Sharks, who have also won one premiership. In fact, since the Dragons entered the competition in 1999, both the Dragons and Sharks have finished higher than the other six times apiece. The rivalry increased in 2005 when they met in a final at a sold out WIN Stadium; the Dragons winning 28\u201322. Cronulla finished the [[1999 NRL season|1999 season]] as minor premiers, but the Dragons beat them 26\u20138 in the preliminary final to progress to the 1999 NRL Grand Final at the Sharks' expense. The Dragons trailed 0\u20138 at halftime.\n\nBoth clubs have been accused of poaching players from the other, and compete for fans in the same region. In 1999, the Cronulla CEO infamously cut up a St George Jersey after a match at [[Endeavour Field|Toyota Stadium]]. During the Super League war, Cronulla-Sutherland was one of only 3 Sydney teams to join the rival competition, entrenching further spite from Dragons fans (Both the [[St George Dragons]] and the [[Illawarra Steelers]] were loyal to the ARL during the [[Super League War]]).\n\nIn 2009, former Dragons captain [[Trent Barrett]] switched to the Sharks after two years in the [[Super League]]. In his return match to Kogarah in round 3, 2009, Barrett was injured and with him went any hopes Cronulla had of winning the premiership (in the preceding year, the Sharks had finished equal-first) that year. Other players to have switched clubs include Lance Thompson and Jeremy Smith (Dragons to Sharks), Beau Scott, Sam Isemonger and Matt Bickerstaff (Sharks to Dragons) and Colin Best (Sharks to Dragons and then back again, as of 2011). In another match in 2009, Sharks captain [[Paul Gallen]] was found guilty of a racial slur involving then Dragons forward [[Mickey Paea]].\n\n[[Image:Charity Shield.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Rugby League Charity Shield (Australia)|Charity Shield]] logo]]\n\n===South Sydney Rabbitohs===\nSt George won 15 premierships before merging with Illawarra. In 2010 they won their first NRL premiership as a merged entity. The South Sydney Rabbitohs have won the most premierships with 21, the Sydney Roosters next on 14 premierships. The Rabbitohs and Dragons met several times in grand finals prior to the merger and being the north-eastern neighbours of St George, had many fierce encounters. The most significant match of this rivalry is the [[Rugby League Charity Shield (Australia)|Charity Shield]], a pre-season fixture between the two sides that was abandoned after the 1999 match but was revived after Souths were re-admitted to the NRL in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rabbitohs.com.au/News/Club-News/Rabbitohs-and-Dragons-Launch-25th-Charity-Shield.html |title=Rabbitohs and Dragons Launch 25th Charity Shield |date=2008-01-31 |website=Rabbitohs official site |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115213821/https://www.rabbitohs.com.au/News/Club-News/Rabbitohs-and-Dragons-Launch-25th-Charity-Shield.html |archive-date=2009-01-15}}</ref>\n\n===Sydney Roosters===\n[[File:Dragons_vs_Roosters,_Anzac_Day_2018.jpg|thumb|right|The pre-match formalities taking place prior to the 2018 Anzac Day clash between the two clubs.]]\nSt George has another strong rivalry with the [[Sydney Roosters]]. St George's first premiership was a 31\u201314 victory over Easts in the [[1941 NSWRFL season]] Grand Final. During 1995, the Roosters had secret discussions to merge with the Dragons, with the Dragons jersey and emblem to disappear. Fans were outraged, and the attempt aborted. St George Illawarra annually contests the [[Club ANZAC Game]] against the Roosters, a tradition dating back to the 1970s, but has been contested regularly since 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rl1908.wordpress.com/clubcomps/ANZAC-Day.htm |title=Rugby League & ANZAC Day |last=Fagan |first=Sean |website=RL1908.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601203449/http://www.rl1908.com/clubcomps/ANZAC-Day.htm |archive-date=2009-06-01}}</ref> The Dragons achieved their first NRL premiership by defeating the Roosters 32\u20138 in the hotly contested [[2010 NRL Grand Final]].\n\n===Brisbane Broncos===\nPrior to the joint-venture, both St George and Illawarra had created strong rivalries with Brisbane in the early 1990s. St George and [[Brisbane Broncos]] contested the [[1992 NSWRL season|1992]] and [[1993 NSWRL season|1993]] [[Grand Final]]s, creating a fierce rivalry (see [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1993]]). Also, Illawarra had produced some memorable performances against Brisbane, including the infamous [[1989 Panasonic Cup (rugby league)|1989 Panasonic Cup]] Final (which Brisbane won) and the 1992 Tooheys Challenge Cup Final (won by Illawarra).\n\nThe St George Illawarra Dragons had the longest winning streak against the Brisbane Broncos than any other club (eight, from round 23, 2005 to round 4, 2009 inclusive, including one final in 2006), across five years. With former [[Brisbane Broncos]] coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]] at the helm of St George Illawarra, and [[Wendell Sailor]], a popular face in the NRL and a former Bronco, the rivalry only increased. In 2009, the Dragons defeated the Broncos at [[Suncorp Stadium]] early, and were then beaten in [[Wollongong]] by the Broncos later on in the season. One game a piece, the two sides met up in [[Brisbane]] in the finals, where they lost to the Broncos 24\u201310, thus ending the Dragons season and also that of [[Wendell Sailor]]'s career. Ironically, his first and last games for the Dragons were both against the Broncos.\n\nSome memorable matches between the Dragons and the Broncos have included:\n*Round 11, 2002: Brisbane were at the top of the ladder undefeated at the time until they ran into the Dragons at [[Sydney Football Stadium|Aussie Stadium]] on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The Dragons won 28\u201320 to inflict Brisbane's first defeat of the season, but in round 17 the Broncos got them back with a 34\u201322 victory at [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]].\n*Round 26, 2003: The Dragons were out of finals contention and the Broncos the previous week had lost a then club-record breaking sixth straight loss when the two teams came together at [[Lang Park|Suncorp Stadium]] in the final round of the 2003 season. The second-string Dragons side, without more than half of its first grade side stunned the Broncos 26\u201325 with hooker [[Mark Riddell]] kicking an improbable penalty goal with just over 90 seconds remaining. This condemned the Broncos to their seventh loss in succession and gave Dragons fans some hope for the 2004 season.\n*Round 12, 2004: Not even an early try from [[Mark Gasnier]] (who was dropped from the [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales State of Origin team]] for disciplinary issues) could inspire the Dragons as they lost by just two points, 24\u201322.\n*Round 23, 2005: In a potential Grand Final preview, scores were locked at 0\u20130 for the majority of the first half before the Dragons broke away in the second half to record a 24\u20134 win and instigate Brisbane's then-traditional late-season poor form.\n*Round 15, 2006: With the Dragons trailing 16\u201312 with two minutes remaining, Dragons winger [[Brett Morris]] scored his first-ever first grade try in the corner in the dying minutes after catching a [[Mathew Head]] [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]]. The try was allowed, leaving Dragons hooker [[Aaron Gorrell]] (in a twist of irony, he later went on to play for the Broncos) with the sideline conversion to win the game. Gorrell nailed it and the Dragons won the match 18\u201316.\n*2nd Qualifying Final, 2006: The Dragons upset the Broncos 20\u20134, the third time the Dragons defeated Brisbane in that year. The Broncos ultimately went on to win the premiership.\n*Round 13, 2008: [[Wendell Sailor]] played his first game for the Dragons against the Broncos, but was rested just before halftime following a jaw injury suffered in the first half. The Dragons won 34\u201316.\n*Round 23, 2008: Sailor marked his return to [[Lang Park|Suncorp Stadium]] with his first try since coming back to rugby league in a win to the Dragons, 24\u201320.\n*Round 4, 2009: [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]], [[Darius Boyd]] and a host of others opposed the Broncos for the first time in their lives. Despite conceding an early try to [[Israel Folau]], the Dragons won 25\u201312 with Wendell Sailor appropriately scoring the match winning try.\n*2nd Semi-Final, 2009: The Broncos ended the Dragons season with a 24\u201310 win, and the Dragons became the first minor premiers in 16 years to be eliminated in just the 2nd round of the Finals.\n*2nd Semi-Final, 2011: The Broncos beat the Dragons 13\u201312 field goal kicked by Darren Lockyer in overtime, Darren won the game with a fractured cheekbone that he received late in the game, this also turned out to be Darren Lockyer's last game for the Broncos and Wayne Bennett (coaching) and Mark Gasnier's last for the Dragons.\n*Round 1, 2018: In the season opener, [[Ben Hunt (rugby league)|Ben Hunt]] played his first game for the Dragons after leaving the Broncos the year before, the Dragons beat the Broncos 34\u201312 with Hunt scoring an intercept try off a poor pass from Broncos recruit [[Matt Lodge]].\n\nPlayers who played for the Dragons who have won premierships with Brisbane include [[Darius Boyd]] and [[Luke Priddis]], who also won a premiership with [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] in 2003. Others of note include [[Nick Emmett]] who was brought to the club by Wayne Bennett, and [[Neville Costigan]], who was sacked just before the Broncos' 2006 success.\n\n===Melbourne Storm===\nThese two teams played in the Grand Final in 1999. It is remembered for the penalty try conceded by Dragons winger [[Jamie Ainscough]] that cost the Dragons the premiership. It was the Dragons' first NRL Grand Final appearance as a merger and the Storm's first Grand Final appearance in just its second year in existence. The Dragons had led 14\u20130 at halftime only for Melbourne to come back and claim a controversial 20\u201318 win following the penalty try two minutes from time.\n\nThe two teams have also had some memorable, not to mention controversial matches in the decade that followed, none more so than the Grand Final rematch in 2000 which saw the Storm annihilate the Dragons 70\u201310 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] (this remains St George Illawarra's biggest defeat as a joint-venture to date). In the lead up to that match, then-Dragons five-eighth [[Anthony Mundine]] had claimed that the Storm were not worthy premiers, sparking anger from the Storm's fans and players, thus the catalyst for the huge win. The Dragons however did claim revenge later that year with a 50\u20134 win at WIN Stadium (that also remains the Storm's worst ever defeat to date).\n\nThe 2009 season opened with these two teams going head to head in another much talked about match. Dragons five-eighth [[Jamie Soward]] was labelled a 'rag doll' in defence whilst trying to stop the Storm's [[Greg Inglis]] scoring a try, however ever since that match Soward's game has matured. The Dragons lost 17\u201316 in extra time, with Inglis scoring the match winning field goal. In the return match, Soward was also the centre of attention as he used his foot to prevent Inglis again from scoring, resulting in an eight-point try and Soward being put on report (he was reprimanded for this). The Dragons won this match 26\u201312. In round 4, 2010, the Dragons were the last team to lose premiership points to the Storm before their salary cap scandal was revealed.\n\nThe rivalry re-ignited when the Dragons were also involved in a controversial loss to Storm at the start of the 2014 season. In their round 6 game at AAMI Park, a refereeing and timekeeping error resulted in Storm scoring a try after the siren had gone, to win them the match. In the 80th minute, Dragons were ahead 24\u201322. The full-time siren sounded in the 80th minute, prior to the Storm player in possession being tackled. After the tackle was completed, the referees allowed play to continue, rather than ending the match, which gave Storm the chance to spread the ball in an elongated play, which resulted in a try and conversion in the 81st minute, giving them the win, 28\u201324.\n\n==Club records==\n'''{{details| List of St. George Illawarra Dragons records}}'''\n'''(As of the end of the 2019 season)'''\n\n===Player records===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Most Games for the Dragons'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The club has competed in the [[National Rugby League]] since [[NRL season 1999|1999]] after a joint-venture was formed between the [[St. George Dragons]] (est. 1921) and the [[Illawarra Steelers]] (est. 1982).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Warne-Smith |first=Drew |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/saints-face-test-with-nerves-of-steelers/story-e6frg7mf-1225933040209 |title=Saints face test with nerves of Steelers |date=2 October 2010 |work=[[The Australian]] |access-date=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120914083856/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/saints-face-test-with-nerves-of-steelers/story-e6frg7mf-1225933040209 |archive-date=14 September 2012}}</ref> They officially formed as the game's first joint-venture club on 23 September 1998 and remain the only cross-city team in the NRL.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wilson |first=Andy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/03/wigan-st-helens-super-league-grand-final |title=Wigan prepare to slay Dragons after crushing St Helens in Grand Final |date=3 October 2010 |work=guardian.co.uk |access-date=24 July 2011}}</ref> The team has its headquarters and leagues clubs in both [[Wollongong]] and the Sydney suburb of [[Kogarah, New South Wales|Kogarah]], and train and play games regularly at [[Wollongong Showground|WIN Stadium]] in Wollongong, as well as at [[Jubilee Oval]] in Kogarah. From 2006 to 2018 the club was jointly owned by the St. George Dragons 50%, Illawarra Steelers 25% and [[WIN Corporation]] 25%. In August 2018 WIN Corporation purchased the Illawarra Steelers remaining 25% stake.\n\nThe Dragons reached the [[grand final]] in their first season in [[1999 NRL season|1999]], losing to the [[Melbourne Storm]]. St. George Illawarra are one of only two clubs (the other being the [[Sydney Roosters]] in 1908) to finish runners-up in their inaugural season. The St. George Illawarra Dragons also field teams in local competitions within the [[St George, New South Wales|St. George]] and [[Illawarra]] regions. In 2010, the Dragons won their second successive minor premiership and became the first team to be awarded the [[J. J. Giltinan Shield]] in consecutive years since the [[National Rugby League]] was formed in 1998.\n\nThe Dragons won the [[2010 NRL Grand Final]] against the [[Sydney Roosters]], defeating them 32\u20138 at [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]], [[Sydney]]. They then won the [[2011 World Club Challenge]], defeating the [[Wigan Warriors]] 21\u201315 at [[DW Stadium]] in the UK. With its [[World Club Challenge]] victory, the club became the first Australian team since the [[Brisbane Broncos]] in 1992-3 to win the minor premiership, premiership and World Club Challenge simultaneously.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|St. George Dragons|Illawarra Steelers}}\nIn the wake of the [[Super League war]] of the mid-1990s, and the resulting [[Australian Rugby League season 1997|split competition of 1997]], the [[Illawarra Steelers]] found themselves struggling financially and seemed unlikely to survive past 1999. The [[St. George Dragons]] largely financed a proposal for a joint venture which would see the St George Illawarra Dragons playing in both Kogarah and Wollongong. Essentially, St George would provide the money while Illawarra would provide a broader junior and fan base. With the NRL's intention to rationalise the competition from 20 teams down to 14 teams and with a $4M incentive and a relaxing of salary cap requirements for a joint venture, the Dragons and the Steelers ensured their survival by forming the League's first joint venture on 23 September 1998.<ref>{{Cite news\n  | title = NRL predicts more teams to seek $4m merger bonus\n  | work = [[Illawarra Mercury]]\n  | place = Australia\n  | page = 44\n  | publisher = [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]]\n  | date = 29 September 1998\n  | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news980930_0130_6398\n  | accessdate = 13 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===David Waite and Andrew Farrar (1999\u20132002)===\nA joint venture entity being a new concept in Australian rugby league, the public watched closely in anticipation of success or failure. No-one was certain how the top players sourced from the two clubs would perform when they ran out onto the field. They were unsuccessful in their first outing, losing to the [[Parramatta Eels]] 20\u201310, but by the 4th round they had started to form some cohesion and would go on to achieve a top eight position on the competition ladder by the end of the regular season. In the semi-finals the Dragons won against the [[Melbourne Storm]] at Olympic Park, before returning to Sydney to dispose of the [[Sydney Roosters]] and the [[Cronulla Sharks]] to reach the Grand Final.\n\nIn the 1999 Grand Final the Dragons were leading by 14\u20130 at the break in front of a world record crowd of 107,999. A fairytale of a title in their first year as a joint venture seemed destined to come true; something of an advertisement to any other clubs considering the option of a joint venture, but the Storm recovered from their poor start and went into the final minutes of the game with the Dragons leading by 18\u201312. The Dragons were forced to perform a drop kick from their own goal line, and on the fifth tackle [[Brett Kimmorley]] kicked high towards the Dragon's corner of the field. As the Storm's winger Craig Smith caught the ball over the goal-line he was knocked unconscious in a tackle by [[Jamie Ainscough]] and lost the ball. Referee [[Bill Harrigan]] deferred to the [[video referee]] who ruled a penalty try on the grounds that contact had been made with the head, giving Melbourne a 20\u201318 lead and the premiership title.\n\nIn the 2000 season though they had a rough start, and in Round 5, the Dragons recorded their worst defeat for the club, losing 70\u201310 against the [[Melbourne Storm]]. This was the first game these two teams played against each other since the 1999 grand final, and was played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. On 3 May to the surprise and shock of fans and club officials, [[Anthony Mundine]] announced his retirement from the club and rugby league in general with immediate effect to pursue a career in [[boxing]]. The Dragons were not going well in the first half of the 2000 season, and the main coach [[David Waite]] was replaced with assistant coach, [[Andrew Farrar]]. Soon after the replacement of coaches, the Dragons recorded their best ever win. They defeated the [[New Zealand Warriors]] 54\u20130 in round 14 at WIN Stadium, with debutant [[Amos Roberts]] scoring a record 22 points (one try and nine goals) for any first grade player on debut. The Dragons, however, missed out of the finals series, and came 9th. Despite their poor season, [[Trent Barrett]] was awarded with the [[Dally M Medal]].\n\n===Nathan Brown (2003\u20132008)===\nIn 2003, Nathan Brown, the joint venture's first number 9 achieved the position of coach, becoming the youngest non-playing coach in premiership history at the age of 29. The Dragons finished the season 10th. Nathan Brown was also involved in a sideline incident when he had slapped Trent Barrett in Wollongong during a game against Manly, and was issued a $5000 fine.\n\n2004 saw the final season of the try scoring talent [[Nathan Blacklock]]. An extraordinary scoreline was seen in the round 25 clash with Manly. Trailing 34\u201310 after 53 minutes the Dragons came back to win the match 36\u201334. This was the second biggest comeback in Australian Rugby League history. Finishing 5th, the Dragons were eliminated in the first round of the finals after losing in a thrilling game 30\u201331 to 4th placed Penrith.\n\nIn 2005, after their worst start to a season yet (losing 5 of their first 6 games), the St. George Illawarra side finished second in a close season on the ladder at completion of the 2005 season, just behind minor premiers the [[Parramatta Eels]] on points difference. After progressing to the finals they defeated local rivals the [[Cronulla Sharks]] 28\u201322 in the quarter final of the finals series though the Dragons eventually fell 12\u201320 to eventual champions the [[Wests Tigers]] in the Preliminary Final. The Dragons broke the ground record at [[WIN Stadium]] twice in the 2005 season. First against rivals the [[Sydney Roosters]] and then at their home quarter final game against the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]].\n\nIn early 2006, WIN Television Network bought a 25% stake in the Illawarra Steelers Club for $6.5 million, erasing most of the debt Illawarra had to St. George. This formalised the strong support the network has shown for the Steelers in years gone by and ensured that Wollongong continued to host world class rugby league matches.\n\nAfter a bad start to the 2006 season, the Dragons put on a midseason 7-game winning streak. This was followed by a form slump, with a record five consecutive losses, only to return to form with a victory over the [[Wests Tigers|Tigers]], and continue this positive form leading into the finals. The Dragons ended the regular season in sixth position.\n\nIn the finals campaign, St George Illawarra faced the [[Brisbane Broncos]] at [[Suncorp Stadium]] in the first round, the Dragons won the game 20\u20134. In the second round, they met the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] winning 28\u20130. In the grand final qualifier, they played the [[Melbourne Storm]], where the Dragons went down 24\u201310 bowing out of season 2006. The Dragons can take solace from the fact that they did defeat the eventual premiers, Brisbane, three times during the 2006 season&nbsp;\u2013 26\u201312 at Wollongong in Round 4, 18\u201316 at Suncorp Stadium in Round 15 and the aforementioned qualifying final match.\n\nSeason 2007 saw an early injury to [[Mark Gasnier]] in the [[Rugby League Charity Shield (Australia)|Charity Shield]] match against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] creating another poor start for the Dragons. Combined with the loss of key players such as [[Luke Bailey (rugby league)|Luke Bailey]], [[Trent Barrett]] and [[Shaun Timmins]] in the off-season, the Dragons faced NRL newcomers, the [[Gold Coast Titans]], in Round 1. The Dragons won the historic match 20\u201318, however lost 6 more matches after that leaving the Dragons sitting in 15th place on the NRL Ladder. This was a very inexperienced Dragons team that seemed destined for a poor injury plagued season. However, in Round 17 (vs [[Canberra Raiders]] at [[WIN Stadium]]), the Dragons scored four times more points than their previous game average, winning the match 58\u201316, equalling their highest ever score and their largest victory in three years. The Dragons season ended with a 28\u201324 loss to the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] at Brookvale Oval, finishing in 13th place, their lowest finish to date.\n\n2008 saw the end of an era, with coach [[Nathan Brown (rugby league born 1973)|Nathan Brown]]'s contract not renewed after yet another poor start to the season, winning 1 of their first 6 matches. The club received a boost in May when former dual-code international player [[Wendell Sailor]] joined the team. Several notable players departed at the end of the year including [[Jason Ryles]]<ref>{{Cite news |last=Webster |first=Andrew |url=http://illawarra.yourguide.com.au/news/local/sport/rugby-league/ryles-quits-dragons/794116.aspx |title=Ryles quits Dragons |date=21 June 2008 |work=[[Illawarra Mercury]] |access-date=21 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712135145/http://illawarra.yourguide.com.au/news/local/sport/rugby-league/ryles-quits-dragons/794116.aspx |archive-date=12 July 2012}}</ref> and captain [[Mark Gasnier]]. The Dragons finished the season in 7th place, however they lost in the first round of the finals to eventual premiers [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] (whom they defeated 20\u201318 in round 11) 34\u20136 at [[Brookvale Oval]] ending yet another disappointing season. The era under Brown was one of frustration for Dragons fans, as there were high expectations for the strong side, but ultimately no premierships.\n\n===Wayne Bennett (2009\u20132011)===\n2009, a new season a new coach and ground sponsor WIN at Jubilee Oval. Several new faces joined the club, including Jeremy Smith, Darius Boyd, Neville Costigan, Michael Weyman and Luke Priddis. The season opener against the Storm ended in a thrilling golden point extra time loss (17\u201316). Round 3 set a new crowd record with the victorious return to WIN Jubilee against Cronulla.\n\nThey were consistently placed first on the competition ladder in 2009, contributed by a continuous winning streak of seven games since their win against the North Queensland Cowboys on 14 June. They lost first position after a three-game losing streak while the Canterbury Bulldogs won all games in that period, but remain in the top three. However, in the final round of the 2009 regular season, St. George Illawarra defeated in-form Parramatta Eels 37\u20130, a game in which winger Brett Morris obtained a hat-trick and man of the match honours, while the Bulldogs lost 34\u201312 to the Wests Tigers. In the same game, St. George Illawarra five-eighth [[Jamie Soward]] surpassed [[Harry Bath]]'s record for most points in a season by a St. George player. As a result, the Dragons won the minor premiership for the 2009 and Wayne Bennett's first season at the club, but the team was eliminated from the finals after losing both their finals matches, therefore becoming the first minor premiers since 1993. In the first match they were humbled in front of a packed Jubilee Stadium, before travelling to face Bennett's former team. The Broncos defeated the Dragons. Season 2010 saw the club lose seven matches&nbsp;\u2013 the same tally as in the 2009 home-and-away season, against eventual wooden spooners the Melbourne Storm, 2008 premiers the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, their perennial bogey team the Canberra Raiders, 2003 premiers the [[Penrith Panthers]] in round 17, the [[Gold Coast Titans]] in extra time in round 20, Bennett's old team the Brisbane Broncos in round 21 and a second time to the [[Canberra Raiders]] in round 24. The team has been placed first since round five.\n\nThe team won its second minor premiership in succession (the first NRL team to do so since the inception of the NRL in 1998) with victory against the Newcastle Knights in the penultimate round of the [[2010 NRL season]]. The Dragons had led the competition from round five right through to the final round, spending 21 consecutive weeks on top of the ladder and therefore spending the longest period of time on top of the ladder in NRL history (not including the Melbourne Storm).\n\nSt George Illawarra met Manly in the first week of the 2010 finals and produced a 28\u20130 victory. The Dragons then defeated [[Wests Tigers]] 13\u201312 with [[Jamie Soward]] kicking the winning field goal for a place in the [[2010 NRL Grand Final]].\n\nIn the [[2010 NRL Grand Final]], St. George Illawarra defeated the [[Sydney Roosters]] 32\u20138, to secure the club's first grand final victory. The Dragons overcame a poor first half performance to pull a thrilling victory out of the hat. This victory made Wayne Bennett's grand final record at 7 wins from 8 and thus continuing Brian Smith's poor grand final record of 4 losses from 4. [[Darius Boyd]] won a premiership with Bennett and the Brisbane Broncos in 2006, won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground in the match.  The Grand Final victory also ended 31 years of hurt for St. George fans as the club had lost previous finals in 1985, 1992, 1993, 1996 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-10-03/dragons-romp-to-sweet-16th/2283388/|title=Dragons romp to sweet 16th|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref>\n\nSt George Illawarra began their 2011 Season with pre-season wins in trials over Canterbury and South Sydney in the Charity Shield. The club also claimed its first [[World Club Challenge]] Championship, defeating [[Wigan Warriors]] 21\u201315 at [[DW Stadium]]. As of Round 14 2011, the Dragons have won 10 straight (excluding a 14\u201314 draw against Parramatta in Round 13).\n\nIt was announced in March 2011 that Bennett would leave St. George after the 2011 season, signing a four-year deal with the [[Newcastle Knights]] from the 2012 season onwards. Steve Price was named as his successor.\n\n===Steve Price and Paul McGregor (2012 \u2013 present)===\n[[File:Dragons cheerleaders.jpg|thumb|right|The club's cheersquad, The Flames, performing during the Dragons' Anzac Day match against the Roosters in 2018.]]\n2012 saw the club with a new coach. The Dragons narrowly missed out on a Finals spot, finishing up in 9th position. Several notable players departed from the club at the end of the season, including [[Ben Hornby]] and [[Dean Young (rugby league)|Dean Young]], who both retired from the sport. The start of the 2013 season saw the arrival of few key acquisitions, namely Gerard Beale from the Broncos and [[Tyson Frizell]] from the Cronulla Sharks. The season was plagued by inconsistent form, alongside injuries and speculation regarding Price's future at the club. After winning three straight matches on the lead up to the annual Anzac Day clash with the Roosters, it was announced that Price would be signed for another year with an option for a second at the clubs disposal. Despite the clubs faith in Price as well as the arrival of star fullback [[Josh Dugan]] from Canberra \u2013 in a mid-season transfer, the club was unable to string together consistent performances and finished the year at 14th position.\n\nStar five-eighth [[Gareth Widdop]] joined the club for 2014, but by late May 2014, just after the star signing of [[Benji Marshall]], the board sacked Price as coach due to some embarrassing defeats to start the season. Assistant coach [[Paul McGregor (rugby league)|Paul McGregor]] was named as his replacement until the end of the season, and was eventually employed full-time following improved results. This culminated in the club returning to the finals in [[2015 NRL season|2015]] and enjoying a successful year.\n\nIn the 2017 NRL Season, St George lead the competition after the first eight rounds before a dramatic slide which saw the club record only six wins for the rest of the season. In the final match of the regular season, St George played against Canterbury with a win guaranteeing them a finals spot and jumping ahead of North Queensland. With under ten minutes to play, St George were ahead on the scoreboard before two quick tries gave Canterbury a 26\u201320 victory.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/dragons/how-it-all-went-wrong-for-the-dragons-in-season-2017/news-story/e8093254b682d51a4f6020b506003924 |title=Did the Dragons really choke? |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=2020-02-18 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Brundson |first=Simon |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/live-nrl-st-george-illawarra-dragons-v-canterbury-bulldogs-score-updates-result-blog/news-story/ad1bb34be8c16d4c69ab0ef9d3c0a91a |title=Dragons v Bulldogs NRL: 2017 finals series, Will Hopoate stats |date=2017-09-03 |work=Fox Sports |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Parkinson |first=Andrew |url=http://www.theleader.com.au/story/4899147/widdop-labels-season-a-failure-after-dragons-miss-finals/ |title=Widdop labels season a 'failure' after Dragons miss finals |date=2017-09-04 |work=St George & Sutherland Shire Leader |access-date=2018-07-19 |url-status=live |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe 2018 season saw the arrival of two star signings, English international [[James Graham (rugby league)|James Graham]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/03/02/james-graham-giving-st-george-illawarra-dragons-pack-extra-belief/ |title=Graham giving Dragons pack extra beef and belief |last=Stanton |first=Tanisha |date=2018-03-02 |website=National Rugby League |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913073706/https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/03/02/james-graham-giving-st-george-illawarra-dragons-pack-extra-belief/ |archive-date=2018-09-13 |access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> and the [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian]] and Queensland halfback [[Ben Hunt (rugby league)|Ben Hunt]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ryan |first=Nathan |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/st-george-illawarra-offer-brisbane-halfback-ben-hunt-lengthy-multimillion-dollar-deal/news-story/e42c28b0def0e5c290a6d3029aa10967 |title=Brisbane halfback Ben Hunt accepts St George Illawarra\u2019s lengthy multi-million dollar deal offer |date=2017-01-20 |work=Fox Sports Australia |access-date=2020-02-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306181127/https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/st-george-illawarra-offer-brisbane-halfback-ben-hunt-lengthy-multimillion-dollar-deal/news-story/e42c28b0def0e5c290a6d3029aa10967 |archive-date=2017-03-06 |language=en-AU}}</ref> These signings and a successful season culminated in the club returning to the finals in [[2018 NRL season|2018]] and enjoyed a successful year.

The merged entity's logo was taken directly from that of St George, with the addition of \"Illawarra\" to the bottom of the emblem. The emblem reflected the rich history of the St George Dragons, including an incredible 11 consecutive premierships, and the future strength of the club with the Illawarra.\n\nThe club name Dragons, is a shortened version of \"Dragonslayers\", the original nickname of St George. The emblem features a red shield with a silhouette of [[St. George]], overlaid with a white stylised [[Dragon]], with the words \"ST. GEORGE\" and \"ILLAWARRA\" above and below the shield respectively. It was originally intended for St George to face right and the Dragon to face left.\n\n===Jerseys===\nWhen the St George Illawarra Dragons were formed in 1998, it was decided that the jersey of St George (first used in 1945), the famous \"Red V\" on white, would become the main jersey for the new club. The red used was changed to the scarlet tone used by the Steelers.\n\nThe alternate jersey initially used by the club was red and white horizontal stripes, similar to the 1921 St George Jersey known as the \"blood and bandages\". Since 2006, this Jersey has been reserved for use as the St George Illawarra Heritage Jersey for special occasions. This Jersey is worn during [[NRL Heritage Round|Heritage Round]], when the Dragons confront fierce local rivals the [[Bulldogs RLFC]].\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, the club used a jersey similar to the Steelers main jersey for Heritage matches, acknowledging the rugby league history of the Illawarra region, though not as a full-time alternate strip. This jersey was predominantly red with white stripes on the sleeves. With [[Adidas]] producing the club's official merchandise from 2006, a generic Adidas design&nbsp;\u2013 predominantly red with three white stripes down the sleeves&nbsp;\u2013 was adopted as the full-time alternate strip; before another re-design in 2008, which better reflected the old Steelers jersey.\n\nReebok produced supporter and team kits from the 2010 season. Again the Red V was the Main jersey and the Alternate jersey was a red design with white slash marks. [[XBlades]] became the main jersey supplier for the 2018 season and onwards.\n\n<gallery perrow=\"4\" align=\"center\" caption=\"St George Illawarra \u2013 Jerseys\">\nImage:St. George Illawarra Dragons home jersey 1999.svg|Main Jersey (1999\u2013)\n</gallery>\n\n==Home grounds==\n[[Image:OKI Jubilee Grandstand.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Inside Jubilee Oval]]\n[[File:WIN Stadium5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Inside WIN Stadium]]\nThe Dragons have two home grounds, reflecting the joint nature of the club:\n\n* [[WIN Stadium]] (1999\u2013present)\n* [[Jubilee Oval]] (1999, 2003\u201307, 2009\u2013present)\n\nHalf of the Dragons home matches are played at [[WIN Stadium]] (previously the home ground of the Illawarra Steelers) and the half at [[Jubilee Oval]] (previously the home of the St George Dragons).\n\nThe club has previously played Sydney home games out of the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] (2000\u20132002) and [[Stadium Australia]] (2008), as well as the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] on special occasions.\n\nThe club has taken their home ground advantage away from their usual home grounds to the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] for the [[Club ANZAC Game]] against the [[Sydney Roosters]] in the 2004, 2006, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018 seasons. In 2002 when the match was first held, the Sydney Football Stadium was, at the time, one of the Dragons' main home grounds, whilst in 2008 the match was played at ANZ Stadium, a very unpopular move amongst supporters.\n[[Image:CarltonStadium.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Outside Jubilee Oval, that includes a Walk of Fame]]\n\n=== Right Game Right Venue Strategy ===\n\nIn 2013, the club entered into a four-year agreement with the NRL to move 4 of their 12 home games to one of the major Sydney stadiums (Allianz Stadium, Sydney Cricket Ground, ANZ Stadium).\n\nThe strategic intent was to replicate the success of the annual game played against Sydney Roosters on ANZAC day. As part of this initiative, the club and the NRL sought to introduce an annual Heritage Round game against South Sydney at the SCG.\n\nIn 2017, the club announced that the NRL had only provided three appropriate games to support this initiative for the 2017 season.\n\nIt was announced that from the 2018 NRL season that all games (except for the ANZAC clash Vs the [[Sydney Roosters]] and one other round) would be shared equally between Kogarah and Wollongong.\n\n{{-}}\n'''Stadium records'''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Highest Attendances at WIN Jubilee Oval'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The St. George Illawarra Dragons also have a huge following in south-east Queensland, as a significant number of the club's 'Red V' memberships are from people in this area. The Dragons also have a large number of supporters from all over NSW, with the club receiving record crowds at away games at [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]] (Stadium Australia) at [[Sydney Olympic Park]].

The Bulldogs were founded in 1935, 14 years after St George. St. George inflicted a RL record 91\u20136 defeat of Canterbury in 1935 but Canterbury enjoyed premiership success first, however St. George recorded 11 straight premierships in the years following (1955\u20131966). It was also the Bulldogs who put an end to their Premiership run in 1967, when the Bulldogs beat them by 1 point in the preliminary final to face the Rabbitohs in the Grand Final. Since then, both clubs have inflicted Premiership defeats on the other, St George defeating the Bulldogs in 1979, Canterbury returning the favour in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rl1908.wordpress.com/Clubs/Canterbury-Bulldogs.htm |title=Canterbury Bulldogs |last=Fagan |first=Sean |website=RL1908.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601140655/http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Canterbury-Bulldogs.htm |archive-date=1 June 2009}}</ref> The two sides are rivals in the [[NRL Heritage Round]]. The Bulldogs and the Dragons also unofficially have a territorial rivalry, with fans from both teams coming in large amounts around [[Arncliffe, New South Wales|Arncliffe]], [[Earlwood]], [[Kingsgrove, New South Wales|Kingsgrove]], [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]], and [[Panania]].\n\n===Parramatta Eels===\nThe St. George Illawarra Dragons and Parramatta Eels rivalry stretched back to 1977 when the St. George Dragons and Parramatta played out the first ever drawn Grand Final result. Parramatta, seeking their first minor premiership after they finished the season on the top of the ladder at the end of the regular season, were beaten 22-0 in the Grand Final Rematch by St. George, who won their first Grand Final since 1966.\n\nThere were many controversial matches between the St. George Illawarra Dragons and the Parramatta Eels. Firstly, in Round 18 2005, the Parramatta Eels won 40-14 in a match which saw [[Trent Barrett]] and [[PJ Marsh]] trade blows after Marsh\u2019s crude charge-down attempt at Barrett, sparking an all-in brawl whitest, the Eels' [[Wade McKinnon]] sprinted to score a match-turning 80 metre try.\n\nA less memorable match saw no points scored between the two teams in Round 13 2006 in the first 70 minutes of play before the Eels slotted a field goal with nine minutes remaining, before the Dragons struck back with two one-pointers to take a 2-1 lead. The Dragons then scored a try through [[Matt Cooper (rugby league)|Matt Cooper]] with mere seconds remaining on the clock to claim an 8-1 victory.\n\nIn the 2009 NRL Finals Series, The St. George Illawarra Dragons finished as the Minor Premiership and faced the Parramatta Eels who finished 8th on the ladder, A week earlier at the same venue, St. George Illawarra had defeated Parramatta 37-0 but in the finals game, Parramatta won 25-12 with Parramatta player [[Jarryd Hayne]] scoring a brilliant solo try. As of the [[2019 NRL season]], this has been the last time where St. George Illawarra and Parramatta have met in a finals series.\n\n===Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks===\nSt George Illawarra's fiercest rivalries is with their Southern neighbour, [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]]. The Sharks originally were part of the St George juniors area, and the Sharks are often referred \nto as St George's \"little brother\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Cronulla-Sharks.htm |title=Cronulla Sharks |last=Fagan |first=Sean |website=RL1908.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830112321/http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Cronulla-Sharks.htm |archive-date=30 August 2009}}</ref> The Dragons have had the same amount of success as the Sharks, who have also won one premiership. In fact, since the Dragons entered the competition in 1999, both the Dragons and Sharks have finished higher than the other six times apiece. The rivalry increased in 2005 when they met in a final at a sold out WIN Stadium; the Dragons winning 28\u201322. Cronulla finished the [[1999 NRL season|1999 season]] as minor premiers, but the Dragons beat them 26\u20138 in the preliminary final to progress to the 1999 NRL Grand Final at the Sharks' expense. The Dragons trailed 0\u20138 at halftime.\n\nBoth clubs have been accused of poaching players from the other, and compete for fans in the same region. In 1999, the Cronulla CEO infamously cut up a St George Jersey after a match at [[Endeavour Field|Toyota Stadium]]. During the Super League war, Cronulla-Sutherland was one of only 3 Sydney teams to join the rival competition, entrenching further spite from Dragons fans (Both the [[St George Dragons]] and the [[Illawarra Steelers]] were loyal to the ARL during the [[Super League War]]).\n\nIn 2009, former Dragons captain [[Trent Barrett]] switched to the Sharks after two years in the [[Super League]]. In his return match to Kogarah in round 3, 2009, Barrett was injured and with him went any hopes Cronulla had of winning the premiership (in the preceding year, the Sharks had finished equal-first) that year. Other players to have switched clubs include Lance Thompson and Jeremy Smith (Dragons to Sharks), Beau Scott, Sam Isemonger and Matt Bickerstaff (Sharks to Dragons) and Colin Best (Sharks to Dragons and then back again, as of 2011). In another match in 2009, Sharks captain [[Paul Gallen]] was found guilty of a racial slur involving then Dragons forward [[Mickey Paea]].\n\n[[Image:Charity Shield.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Rugby League Charity Shield (Australia)|Charity Shield]] logo]]\n\n===South Sydney Rabbitohs===\nSt George won 15 premierships before merging with Illawarra. In 2010 they won their first NRL premiership as a merged entity. The South Sydney Rabbitohs have won the most premierships with 21, the Sydney Roosters next on 14 premierships. The Rabbitohs and Dragons met several times in grand finals prior to the merger and being the north-eastern neighbours of St George, had many fierce encounters. The most significant match of this rivalry is the [[Rugby League Charity Shield (Australia)|Charity Shield]], a pre-season fixture between the two sides that was abandoned after the 1999 match but was revived after Souths were re-admitted to the NRL in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rabbitohs.com.au/News/Club-News/Rabbitohs-and-Dragons-Launch-25th-Charity-Shield.html |title=Rabbitohs and Dragons Launch 25th Charity Shield |date=2008-01-31 |website=Rabbitohs official site |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115213821/https://www.rabbitohs.com.au/News/Club-News/Rabbitohs-and-Dragons-Launch-25th-Charity-Shield.html |archive-date=2009-01-15}}</ref>\n\n===Sydney Roosters===\n[[File:Dragons_vs_Roosters,_Anzac_Day_2018.jpg|thumb|right|The pre-match formalities taking place prior to the 2018 Anzac Day clash between the two clubs.]]\nSt George has another strong rivalry with the [[Sydney Roosters]]. St George's first premiership was a 31\u201314 victory over Easts in the [[1941 NSWRFL season]] Grand Final. During 1995, the Roosters had secret discussions to merge with the Dragons, with the Dragons jersey and emblem to disappear. Fans were outraged, and the attempt aborted. St George Illawarra annually contests the [[Club ANZAC Game]] against the Roosters, a tradition dating back to the 1970s, but has been contested regularly since 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rl1908.wordpress.com/clubcomps/ANZAC-Day.htm |title=Rugby League & ANZAC Day |last=Fagan |first=Sean |website=RL1908.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601203449/http://www.rl1908.com/clubcomps/ANZAC-Day.htm |archive-date=2009-06-01}}</ref> The Dragons achieved their first NRL premiership by defeating the Roosters 32\u20138 in the hotly contested [[2010 NRL Grand Final]].\n\n===Brisbane Broncos===\nPrior to the joint-venture, both St George and Illawarra had created strong rivalries with Brisbane in the early 1990s. St George and [[Brisbane Broncos]] contested the [[1992 NSWRL season|1992]] and [[1993 NSWRL season|1993]] [[Grand Final]]s, creating a fierce rivalry (see [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1993]]). Also, Illawarra had produced some memorable performances against Brisbane, including the infamous [[1989 Panasonic Cup (rugby league)|1989 Panasonic Cup]] Final (which Brisbane won) and the 1992 Tooheys Challenge Cup Final (won by Illawarra).\n\nThe St George Illawarra Dragons had the longest winning streak against the Brisbane Broncos than any other club (eight, from round 23, 2005 to round 4, 2009 inclusive, including one final in 2006), across five years. With former [[Brisbane Broncos]] coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]] at the helm of St George Illawarra, and [[Wendell Sailor]], a popular face in the NRL and a former Bronco, the rivalry only increased. In 2009, the Dragons defeated the Broncos at [[Suncorp Stadium]] early, and were then beaten in [[Wollongong]] by the Broncos later on in the season. One game a piece, the two sides met up in [[Brisbane]] in the finals, where they lost to the Broncos 24\u201310, thus ending the Dragons season and also that of [[Wendell Sailor]]'s career. Ironically, his first and last games for the Dragons were both against the Broncos.\n\nSome memorable matches between the Dragons and the Broncos have included:\n*Round 11, 2002: Brisbane were at the top of the ladder undefeated at the time until they ran into the Dragons at [[Sydney Football Stadium|Aussie Stadium]] on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The Dragons won 28\u201320 to inflict Brisbane's first defeat of the season, but in round 17 the Broncos got them back with a 34\u201322 victory at [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]].\n*Round 26, 2003: The Dragons were out of finals contention and the Broncos the previous week had lost a then club-record breaking sixth straight loss when the two teams came together at [[Lang Park|Suncorp Stadium]] in the final round of the 2003 season. The second-string Dragons side, without more than half of its first grade side stunned the Broncos 26\u201325 with hooker [[Mark Riddell]] kicking an improbable penalty goal with just over 90 seconds remaining. This condemned the Broncos to their seventh loss in succession and gave Dragons fans some hope for the 2004 season.\n*Round 12, 2004: Not even an early try from [[Mark Gasnier]] (who was dropped from the [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales State of Origin team]] for disciplinary issues) could inspire the Dragons as they lost by just two points, 24\u201322.\n*Round 23, 2005: In a potential Grand Final preview, scores were locked at 0\u20130 for the majority of the first half before the Dragons broke away in the second half to record a 24\u20134 win and instigate Brisbane's then-traditional late-season poor form.\n*Round 15, 2006: With the Dragons trailing 16\u201312 with two minutes remaining, Dragons winger [[Brett Morris]] scored his first-ever first grade try in the corner in the dying minutes after catching a [[Mathew Head]] [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]]. The try was allowed, leaving Dragons hooker [[Aaron Gorrell]] (in a twist of irony, he later went on to play for the Broncos) with the sideline conversion to win the game. Gorrell nailed it and the Dragons won the match 18\u201316.\n*2nd Qualifying Final, 2006: The Dragons upset the Broncos 20\u20134, the third time the Dragons defeated Brisbane in that year. The Broncos ultimately went on to win the premiership.\n*Round 13, 2008: [[Wendell Sailor]] played his first game for the Dragons against the Broncos, but was rested just before halftime following a jaw injury suffered in the first half. The Dragons won 34\u201316.\n*Round 23, 2008: Sailor marked his return to [[Lang Park|Suncorp Stadium]] with his first try since coming back to rugby league in a win to the Dragons, 24\u201320.\n*Round 4, 2009: [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]], [[Darius Boyd]] and a host of others opposed the Broncos for the first time in their lives. Despite conceding an early try to [[Israel Folau]], the Dragons won 25\u201312 with Wendell Sailor appropriately scoring the match winning try.\n*2nd Semi-Final, 2009: The Broncos ended the Dragons season with a 24\u201310 win, and the Dragons became the first minor premiers in 16 years to be eliminated in just the 2nd round of the Finals.\n*2nd Semi-Final, 2011: The Broncos beat the Dragons 13\u201312 field goal kicked by Darren Lockyer in overtime, Darren won the game with a fractured cheekbone that he received late in the game, this also turned out to be Darren Lockyer's last game for the Broncos and Wayne Bennett (coaching) and Mark Gasnier's last for the Dragons.\n*Round 1, 2018: In the season opener, [[Ben Hunt (rugby league)|Ben Hunt]] played his first game for the Dragons after leaving the Broncos the year before, the Dragons beat the Broncos 34\u201312 with Hunt scoring an intercept try off a poor pass from Broncos recruit [[Matt Lodge]].\n\nPlayers who played for the Dragons who have won premierships with Brisbane include [[Darius Boyd]] and [[Luke Priddis]], who also won a premiership with [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] in 2003. Others of note include [[Nick Emmett]] who was brought to the club by Wayne Bennett, and [[Neville Costigan]], who was sacked just before the Broncos' 2006 success.\n\n===Melbourne Storm===\nThese two teams played in the Grand Final in 1999. It is remembered for the penalty try conceded by Dragons winger [[Jamie Ainscough]] that cost the Dragons the premiership. It was the Dragons' first NRL Grand Final appearance as a merger and the Storm's first Grand Final appearance in just its second year in existence. The Dragons had led 14\u20130 at halftime only for Melbourne to come back and claim a controversial 20\u201318 win following the penalty try two minutes from time.\n\nThe two teams have also had some memorable, not to mention controversial matches in the decade that followed, none more so than the Grand Final rematch in 2000 which saw the Storm annihilate the Dragons 70\u201310 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] (this remains St George Illawarra's biggest defeat as a joint-venture to date). In the lead up to that match, then-Dragons five-eighth [[Anthony Mundine]] had claimed that the Storm were not worthy premiers, sparking anger from the Storm's fans and players, thus the catalyst for the huge win. The Dragons however did claim revenge later that year with a 50\u20134 win at WIN Stadium (that also remains the Storm's worst ever defeat to date).\n\nThe 2009 season opened with these two teams going head to head in another much talked about match. Dragons five-eighth [[Jamie Soward]] was labelled a 'rag doll' in defence whilst trying to stop the Storm's [[Greg Inglis]] scoring a try, however ever since that match Soward's game has matured. The Dragons lost 17\u201316 in extra time, with Inglis scoring the match winning field goal. In the return match, Soward was also the centre of attention as he used his foot to prevent Inglis again from scoring, resulting in an eight-point try and Soward being put on report (he was reprimanded for this). The Dragons won this match 26\u201312. In round 4, 2010, the Dragons were the last team to lose premiership points to the Storm before their salary cap scandal was revealed.\n\nThe rivalry re-ignited when the Dragons were also involved in a controversial loss to Storm at the start of the 2014 season. In their round 6 game at AAMI Park, a refereeing and timekeeping error resulted in Storm scoring a try after the siren had gone, to win them the match. In the 80th minute, Dragons were ahead 24\u201322. The full-time siren sounded in the 80th minute, prior to the Storm player in possession being tackled. After the tackle was completed, the referees allowed play to continue, rather than ending the match, which gave Storm the chance to spread the ball in an elongated play, which resulted in a try and conversion in the 81st minute, giving them the win, 28\u201324.\n\n==Club records==\n'''{{details| List of St. George Illawarra Dragons records}}'''\n'''(As of the end of the 2019 season)'''\n\n===Player records===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Most Games for the Dragons'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
