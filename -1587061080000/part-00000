He was unable to see the objects and thus failed the challenge.<ref name=\"Flam\"/>\n\nApplicant Fei Wang appeared before the skeptic audience July 2014 with the claim that he could send energy through his hand using a type of [[therapeutic touch]]. The organizers set up a double blind test involving a volunteer selected by Wang to place their hand in a box while wearing noise canceling headphones and a blindfold. Wang or the control person ([[Jamy Ian Swiss]]) depending on the roll of a die would insert their hand also in the box (not touching the volunteer) for several seconds. Swiss was selected to be the control because Wang felt that Swiss does not have the ability that is being tested. After either Wang or the Control (Swiss) had placed their hand in the box, the volunteer would state which energy was felt. Wang had to get 8 out of 9 correct in order to pass to the final Million Dollar challenge. After the volunteer was unable to feel the energy that Wang said he was sending through his hand on the first two tries, the test was concluded as it was no longer possible for Wang to win the challenge even if he was chosen correct on the remaining tries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Million Dollar Challenge|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=534&v=l20jQj0FZ_E|publisher=JREF|accessdate=April 28, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313210632/https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=534&v=l20jQj0FZ_E|archivedate=March 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTech journalist Lee Hutchinson approached the JREF after writing an article for Ars Technica about directional [[Ethernet]] cables that claim to \"keep your audio signal completely free of electromagnetic interference\".

The organizers set up a double blind test involving a volunteer selected by Wang to place their hand in a box while wearing noise canceling headphones and a blindfold. Wang or the control person ([[Jamy Ian Swiss]]) depending on the roll of a die would insert their hand also in the box (not touching the volunteer) for several seconds. Swiss was selected to be the control because Wang felt that Swiss does not have the ability that is being tested. After either Wang or the Control (Swiss) had placed their hand in the box, the volunteer would state which energy was felt. Wang had to get 8 out of 9 correct in order to pass to the final Million Dollar challenge.

The hymn is sometimes sung at weddings or funerals, and in Ireland is associated with Christmas as well as Easter. An English translation was written in 1923 by Richard Hoyle (1875\u20131939).

Indian authorities have interpreted the law to mean a person cannot have a second country's passport simultaneously with an Indian one \u2014 even in the case of a child who is claimed by another country as a citizen of that country, and who may be required by the laws of the other country to use one of its passports for foreign travel (such as a child born in United States or in Australia to Indian parents), and the Indian courts have given the executive branch wide discretion over this matter.\n\nOn the recommendations of a High-Level Committee on Indian Diaspora, the [[Government of India]] decided to register Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) of a certain category, as has been specified in the Section 7A of the [[Citizenship Act, 1955]], as Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) cardholders.<ref name=\"Introduction\">{{cite web|title=Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) Cardholder - Introduction|url=http://mha1.nic.in/pdfs/intro.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs|accessdate=16 April 2016}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nBefore 29 January 2015, travellers holding OCI card were required to carry the passport which contained the lifetime visa while traveling to India. This requirement was done away with that day and OCI card holders no longer require the visa sticker passport. The OCI card (the blue booklet) in conjunction with a current valid foreign passport is sufficient to travel to and from [[India]].\n\nPreviously, the government could cancel OCI status of people who obtained it by fraud, showed acts of unpatriotism, or broke a law punishable with at least two years in jail before five years of having issued OCI. The [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019]] gives the government additional power to strip people of their Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status if they violate any local law, whether it is a petty offense or a serious felony. The new act makes the rules much more strict for OCI card holders in a justified attempt to preserve the status\u2019s dignity.

The ''OCI'' was introduced in response to demands for [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] by the [[Indian diaspora]], particularly in developed countries.

This requirement was done away with that day and OCI card holders no longer require the visa sticker passport. The OCI card (the blue booklet) in conjunction with a current valid foreign passport is sufficient to travel to and from [[India]].\n\nPreviously, the government could cancel OCI status of people who obtained it by fraud, showed acts of unpatriotism, or broke a law punishable with at least two years in jail before five years of having issued OCI. The [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019]] gives the government additional power to strip people of their Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status if they violate any local law, whether it is a petty offense or a serious felony. The new act makes the rules much more strict for OCI card holders in a justified attempt to preserve the status\u2019s dignity. However, it also has a proviso which gives the person whose OCI status is at stake the power of being heard by the government before they come to a verdict.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50670393|title=Why India's new citizenship bill is controversial|date=2019-12-11|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> \n\nIn March 2020 visa-free travel granted to OCI holders were put on hold till 15 April due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/india-suspends-visas-attempt-coronavirus-spread-200312035057594.html|title=India suspends visas in attempt to contain coronavirus spread|website=www.aljazeera.com}}</ref>\n\n==Eligibility==\nThe Government of India, on application, may register any person as an Overseas Citizen of India, if the person:\n* was a citizen of India on 26 January 1950 or at any time thereafter; or\n* belonged to a territory that became part of India after 15 August 1947; or\n* was eligible to become a citizen of India on 26 January 1950; or\n* is a child or a grandchild or a great-grandchild of such a citizen; or\n* is a minor child of such persons mentioned above; or\n* is a minor child and whose both parents are citizens of India or one of the parents is a citizen of India; or \n* is a spouse of foreign origin of a citizen of India or spouse of foreign origin of an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder registered under section 7A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and whose marriage has been registered and subsisted for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the application\n\nNo person, who or either of whose parents or grandparents or great grandparents is or had been a citizen of Pakistan & Bangladesh, is eligible for registration as an Overseas Citizen of India.<ref name=\"Eligibility criteria\">{{cite web|title=Eligibility criteria|url=http://mha1.nic.in/pdfs/oci-brochure.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs|accessdate=16 April 2016}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> Persons who served as a member of any foreign military are also ineligible to receive an OCI card.<ref>{{cite web |title=No OCI card to people with military background |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/no-oci-card-to-people-with-military-background/articleshow/55374143.cms |website=The Economic Times |accessdate=15 April 2019 |date=11 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Visa {{!}} India Visa Application {{!}} Faqs {{!}} Oci {{!}} General Oci Questions {{!}} Who Is Not Eligible To Apply For An Oci Card |url=https://www.in.ckgs.us/faq/oci/general-oci-questions/848/who-is-not-eligible-to-apply-for-an-oci-card#848 |website=www.in.ckgs.us |accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Application==\nApplications for OCI can only be made online at [https://ociservices.gov.in/ ociservices.gov.in].

In case the birth certificate is issued by a foreign authority, it must be apostilled or endorsed by the concerned Indian diplomatic mission abroad. In the case of a minor child whose parents are both Indian citizens or who has at least one parent holding Indian citizenship, evidence may comprise a copy of the child's birth certificate that mentions its parents, a copy of Indian passport of at least one of the parents or copy of the Domicile Certificate or Nativity Certificate issued by a Competent Authority supporting the Indian origin of at least one parent or any other proof substantiating the status of at least one parent as being either an Indian citizen or being of Indian origin. If the parents are divorced, a court order of dissolution of marriage which specifically mentions that the legal custody of the child is with the parent who is applying for the OCI card must be submitted.\n\nEvidence as spouse of foreign origin of a citizen of India or spouse of foreign origin of an OCI Cardholder may be provided in the form of a registered marriage certificate. In the case of spouse of an Indian citizen, a copy of the Indian Passport of the spouse or copy of the Domicile Certificate or Nativity Certificate issued by the Competent Authority in respect of the Indian spouse or any other proof substantiating the status of the spouse as being an Indian citizen.

In 2009, the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs granted OCI card holders parity with NRIs for working as doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, advocates, architects, and chartered accountants. And the parity with NRIs was extended to entry fees for national monuments, historical sites, and museums. Further, in 2012, the privilege was added that Indian State governments should ensure that OCI registration booklets are treated as overseas citizens\u2019 identification and included a facilitated rule for providing proof of residence.<ref name=\"Daniel Naujoks 2013\">Daniel Naujoks. 2013.
