The Titans compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC South|South]] division. Previously known as the [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]], the team began play in [[1960 Houston Oilers season|1960]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL). The Oilers won the first two AFL Championships, and joined the NFL as part of the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] in [[1970 Houston Oilers season|1970]].\n\nThe team [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocated]] from Houston to Tennessee in [[1997 Tennessee Oilers season|1997]], and played at the [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] for one season. The team then moved to Nashville in [[1998 Tennessee Oilers season|1998]] and played in [[Vanderbilt Stadium]].

Except for minor color changes throughout the years, this logo remained the same until the team was renamed the Titans in 1999. The logo was originally called \"Ol' Riggy\", but this was dropped before the start of the 1974 season.\n\nThe Oilers' uniforms consisted of blue or white jerseys, red trim, and white pants. From 1966 through 1971, the pants with both the blue and white jerseys were silver, to match the color of the helmets. The team commonly wore light blue pants on the road with the white jerseys from 1972 through 1994, with the exception of the 1980 season, and selected games in the mid 80s, when the team wore an all-white road combination. For selected games in 1973 and 1974, and again from 1981 through 1984, the Oilers wore their white jerseys at home. The light blue pants were discarded by coach [[Jeff Fisher]] in 1995.\n\nFrom 1960 to about 1965 and from 1972 to 1974, they wore blue helmets; from 1966 to 1971, the helmets were silver; and they were white from 1975 to 1998.\n\nDuring the 1997\u201398 period, when they were known as the \"Tennessee Oilers\", the team had an alternate logo that combined elements of the [[flag of Tennessee]] with the derrick logo. The team also wore their white uniforms in home games, as opposed to their time in Houston, when their blue uniforms were worn at home \u2013 in the two years as the Tennessee Oilers, the team only wore their colored jerseys twice, for road games against the [[Miami Dolphins]] and a [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] game against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]; they wore all-white exclusively in their last year under the Tennessee Oilers banner.\n\nWhen the team was renamed the Titans, the club introduced a new logo: a circle with three stars, similar to that found on the [[flag of Tennessee]], containing a large \"T\" with a trail of flames similar to a comet. The uniforms consisted of white helmets, red trim, and either navy or white jerseys. White pants were normally worn with the navy jerseys, and navy pants were worn with the white jerseys. On both the navy and white jerseys, the outside shoulders and sleeves were light Titans blue. In a game against the [[Washington Redskins]] in 2006, the Titans wore their navy jerseys with navy pants for the first time.\n\nSince 2000, the Titans have generally worn their dark uniforms at home throughout the preseason and regular season. They have worn white at home during daytime contests on many occasions for September home games to gain an advantage with the heat except in the 2005, 2006, and 2008 seasons.\n\nThe Titans introduced an alternate jersey in 2003 that was light Titans blue, with navy outside shoulders and sleeves. That jersey was usually worn with the road blue pants. When it was the alternate jersey from 2003 to 2007, the Titans wore the jersey twice in each regular season game (and once in the preseason). They always wore the Titans blue jersey in their annual divisional game against the [[Houston Texans]] and for other selected home games which came mostly against a team from the old AFL ([[American Football League]]). Their selection in those games were representative of the organization's ties to Houston and the old AFL. In November 2006, the Titans introduced light Titans blue pants in a game at the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The pants were reminiscent of the ones donned by the Oilers. In December 2006, they combined the Titans blue pants with the Titans blue jersey to create an all Titans blue uniform \u2013 [[Vince Young]] appeared in this uniform in the cover art for the ''[[Madden NFL 08]]'' video game.\n\nDuring the 2006 season, the Titans wore seven different uniform combinations, pairing the white jersey with all three sets of pants (white, Titans blue, navy blue), the navy jersey with the white and navy pants, and the Titans blue jersey with navy and Titans blue pants. In a 2007 against the [[Atlanta Falcons]], the Titans paired the navy blue jersey with the Titans blue pants for the first time. They also wore the navy blue jerseys with the light blue pants against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. The team paired the Titans blue jerseys with the white pants for the first time on November 14, 2013, in a home game against the [[Indianapolis Colts]].\n\nIn 2008, the Titans blue jerseys became the regular home uniforms, with the navy blue jerseys being relegated to alternate status,<ref>{{cite web|last=Samuel|first=Michael|title=Titans Decide To Change Their Home Uniform|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/35313-titans-decide-to-change-their-home-uniform|website=Bleacher Report|date=July 6, 2008|accessdate=December 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722195036/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/35313-titans-decide-to-change-their-home-uniform|archive-date=July 22, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> but not worn until 2013 \u2014 ''see below''.\n\nIn 2009, the NFL and the Hall of Fame committee announced that the Tennessee Titans and [[Buffalo Bills]] would begin the 2009 NFL preseason in the Hall of Fame Game. The game, played on Sunday, August 9, 2009, at Canton's [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] Field at [[Fawcett Stadium]], was nationally televised on [[NBC]].

The Titans compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC South|South]] division. Previously known as the [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]], the team began play in [[1960 Houston Oilers season|1960]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL). The Oilers won the first two AFL Championships, and joined the NFL as part of the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] in [[1970 Houston Oilers season|1970]].\n\nThe team [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocated]] from Houston to Tennessee in [[1997 Tennessee Oilers season|1997]], and played at the [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] for one season. The team then moved to Nashville in [[1998 Tennessee Oilers season|1998]] and played in [[Vanderbilt Stadium]]. For those two years, they were known as the \"Tennessee Oilers\", but changed their name to \"Tennessee Titans\" for the [[1999 Tennessee Titans season|1999 season]]. The team currently plays at [[Nissan Stadium]] in Nashville, which opened in 1999 as Adelphia Coliseum. The Titans' training facility is at Saint Thomas Sports Park, a {{convert|31|acre|adj=on}} site at the MetroCenter complex in Nashville.<ref>{{cite news|title=Titans Practice Facility Renamed \"Saint Thomas Sports Park\"|url=https://www.titansonline.com/news/titans-practice-facility-renamed-saint-thomas-sports-park-10455494|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=TitansOnline.com|date=July 11, 2013|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630212206/https://www.titansonline.com/news/titans-practice-facility-renamed-saint-thomas-sports-park-10455494|archive-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the club's history, the Titans have played in the [[Super Bowl]] once ([[Super Bowl XXXIV|XXXIV]], at the end of the [[1999 NFL season]]); the Titans lost 23\u201316 to the [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Houston Oilers|History of the Tennessee Titans}}\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n[[File:AFCS-Uniform-TEN.PNG|thumb|left|The Tennessee Titans uniforms used from [[1999 Tennessee Titans season|1999]]\u2013[[2017 Tennessee Titans season|2017]].]]\n\nWhen the team debuted as the Houston Oilers in 1960, the club's logo was an oil rig [[derrick]]. Except for minor color changes throughout the years, this logo remained the same until the team was renamed the Titans in 1999. The logo was originally called \"Ol' Riggy\", but this was dropped before the start of the 1974 season.\n\nThe Oilers' uniforms consisted of blue or white jerseys, red trim, and white pants. From 1966 through 1971, the pants with both the blue and white jerseys were silver, to match the color of the helmets. The team commonly wore light blue pants on the road with the white jerseys from 1972 through 1994, with the exception of the 1980 season, and selected games in the mid 80s, when the team wore an all-white road combination. For selected games in 1973 and 1974, and again from 1981 through 1984, the Oilers wore their white jerseys at home. The light blue pants were discarded by coach [[Jeff Fisher]] in 1995.\n\nFrom 1960 to about 1965 and from 1972 to 1974, they wore blue helmets; from 1966 to 1971, the helmets were silver; and they were white from 1975 to 1998.\n\nDuring the 1997\u201398 period, when they were known as the \"Tennessee Oilers\", the team had an alternate logo that combined elements of the [[flag of Tennessee]] with the derrick logo. The team also wore their white uniforms in home games, as opposed to their time in Houston, when their blue uniforms were worn at home \u2013 in the two years as the Tennessee Oilers, the team only wore their colored jerseys twice, for road games against the [[Miami Dolphins]] and a [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] game against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]; they wore all-white exclusively in their last year under the Tennessee Oilers banner.\n\nWhen the team was renamed the Titans, the club introduced a new logo: a circle with three stars, similar to that found on the [[flag of Tennessee]], containing a large \"T\" with a trail of flames similar to a comet. The uniforms consisted of white helmets, red trim, and either navy or white jerseys. White pants were normally worn with the navy jerseys, and navy pants were worn with the white jerseys. On both the navy and white jerseys, the outside shoulders and sleeves were light Titans blue. In a game against the [[Washington Redskins]] in 2006, the Titans wore their navy jerseys with navy pants for the first time.\n\nSince 2000, the Titans have generally worn their dark uniforms at home throughout the preseason and regular season. They have worn white at home during daytime contests on many occasions for September home games to gain an advantage with the heat except in the 2005, 2006, and 2008 seasons.\n\nThe Titans introduced an alternate jersey in 2003 that was light Titans blue, with navy outside shoulders and sleeves. That jersey was usually worn with the road blue pants. When it was the alternate jersey from 2003 to 2007, the Titans wore the jersey twice in each regular season game (and once in the preseason). They always wore the Titans blue jersey in their annual divisional game against the [[Houston Texans]] and for other selected home games which came mostly against a team from the old AFL ([[American Football League]]). Their selection in those games were representative of the organization's ties to Houston and the old AFL. In November 2006, the Titans introduced light Titans blue pants in a game at the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The pants were reminiscent of the ones donned by the Oilers. In December 2006, they combined the Titans blue pants with the Titans blue jersey to create an all Titans blue uniform \u2013 [[Vince Young]] appeared in this uniform in the cover art for the ''[[Madden NFL 08]]'' video game.\n\nDuring the 2006 season, the Titans wore seven different uniform combinations, pairing the white jersey with all three sets of pants (white, Titans blue, navy blue), the navy jersey with the white and navy pants, and the Titans blue jersey with navy and Titans blue pants. In a 2007 against the [[Atlanta Falcons]], the Titans paired the navy blue jersey with the Titans blue pants for the first time. They also wore the navy blue jerseys with the light blue pants against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. The team paired the Titans blue jerseys with the white pants for the first time on November 14, 2013, in a home game against the [[Indianapolis Colts]].\n\nIn 2008, the Titans blue jerseys became the regular home uniforms, with the navy blue jerseys being relegated to alternate status,<ref>{{cite web|last=Samuel|first=Michael|title=Titans Decide To Change Their Home Uniform|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/35313-titans-decide-to-change-their-home-uniform|website=Bleacher Report|date=July 6, 2008|accessdate=December 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722195036/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/35313-titans-decide-to-change-their-home-uniform|archive-date=July 22, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> but not worn until 2013 \u2014 ''see below''.\n\nIn 2009, the NFL and the Hall of Fame committee announced that the Tennessee Titans and [[Buffalo Bills]] would begin the 2009 NFL preseason in the Hall of Fame Game. The game, played on Sunday, August 9, 2009, at Canton's [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] Field at [[Fawcett Stadium]], was nationally televised on [[NBC]].

They also have historical rivalries with former divisional opponents such as the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Baltimore Ravens]] (formerly the original [[Cleveland Browns]]) and [[Buffalo Bills]], and during their time as the Houston Oilers, shared an [[Governor's Cup (Texas)|in-state rivalry]] with the [[Dallas Cowboys]].\n\n===Divisional rivalries===\n{{See also|Jaguars\u2013Titans rivalry|Texans\u2013Titans rivalry}}\nSince their founding, the Jaguars have been seen from time to time as the Titans' primary rival due to constantly competitive games between the two franchises. The rivalry was heated in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to the success of both franchises at the time, including a season in which Jacksonville went 14-2 and Tennessee went 13-3. That season, all three of Jacksonville's losses (including the playoffs) came against the Titans, who went on to play in [[Super Bowl XXXIV]]. The rivalry then cooled with both teams experiencing misfortune in the late 2000s to early 2010s, but both teams ended lengthy playoff droughts in [[2017 NFL season|2017]].\n\nThe Texans see the Titans as their primary rival due to the Titans' previous history in Houston until their relocation to Tennessee. The Titans dominated the rivalry in the early 2000s, but the series has since evened out in the 2010s.\n\nThe Colts have been very dominant in their rivalry with the Titans since the creation of the AFC South, with quarterbacks [[Peyton Manning]] and later [[Andrew Luck]] leading the Colts to consistent success against the Titans and the rest of the division.

The story follows a group of female middle school students who choose to become [[magical girl]]s, subsequently battling surreal enemies known as \"witches.\" In consequence, they learn of the anguish and peril associated with their new role.\n\nThe first ten episodes of the series aired in Japan on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] and [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] between January and March 2011, while the final two episodes were delayed until April 2011 due to the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. A [[manga]] adaptation of the series and various spin-off manga series have been published by [[Houbunsha]] and licensed in North America by [[Yen Press]]. A novelization by [[Nitroplus]] was released in August 2011, and a dedicated magazine titled ''Manga Time Kirara Magica'' was launched by Houbunsha in June 2012.</onlyinclude> A video game for the [[PlayStation Portable]] was released in March 2012 and another for [[PlayStation Vita]] was released in December 2013. A [[Puella Magi Madoka Magica: The Movie|film series]] has also been produced; it consists of two films recapping the anime series and released in October 2012. A third film featuring an original story was released on October 26, 2013, and a concept film acting as a trailer for a new project was screened in December 2015. A [[smartphone]] game, ''[[Magia Record]]'', launched in August 2017, and an anime adaptation premiered in January 2020.\n\n''Puella Magi Madoka Magica'' has received widespread critical acclaim; critics praised the complex narrative, visuals, artistic direction, and soundtrack of the series as well as its unconventional approach to the magical girl subgenre. It became a commercial success; each [[Blu-ray Disc]] volume sold more than 50,000 copies in Japan. The series garnered a variety of awards, such as the Television Award at the 16th [[Animation Kobe]] Awards, as well as 12 ''[[Newtype]]'' Anime Awards and the Grand Prize for animation in the 2011 [[Japan Media Arts Festival|Japan Media Arts awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica characters}}\n\nIn the fictional city of Mitakihara, Japan, a middle school student named [[Madoka Kaname]] and her friend [[List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica characters#Sayaka Miki|Sayaka Miki]] encounter a small, cat-like creature named [[List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica characters#Kyubey|Kyubey]]. It offers a contract in which a girl may have any wish granted in exchange for obtaining magical powers and being tasked with fighting witches. Meanwhile, a transfer student and magical girl named [[Homura Akemi]] tries to stop Madoka from making the contract with Kyubey. Madoka and Sayaka then meet [[Mami Tomoe]], an [[upperclassman]] at the same school who is also a magical girl. Noticing their indecisiveness on whether to become a magical girl, Mami offers to take Madoka and Sayaka along on her witch hunts so they may learn of the responsibilities that come with being a magical girl.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=That Would Be Truly Wonderful |series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica |network=[[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] |number=2 |episodelink=List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica episodes#ep2 |airdate=January 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, after witnessing Mami's death at the hands of a witch, Madoka realizes the life of a magical girl is filled with danger, anguish, and suffering.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=I'm Not Afraid of Anything Anymore |series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica |network=[[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] |number=3 |episodelink=List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica episodes#ep3 |airdate=January 21, 2011}}</ref> This is further enforced by the appearance of [[List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica characters#Kyoko Sakura|Kyoko Sakura]], a veteran magical girl whose wish indirectly caused the death of her family. Madoka also discovers magical girls give up their souls to form their Soul Gems, the source of their magic, and that when Soul Gems become too tainted with despair, magical girls change into witches. \n\nSayaka decides to become a magical girl after learning that doing so would allow her to heal a young musician who she admires. However, her classmate Hitomi Shizuki confesses to him first, causing Sayaka to become disillusioned and fall into an inescapable despair that turns her into a witch.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=I Was Stupid, So Stupid |series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica |network=[[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] |number=8 |episodelink=List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica episodes#ep8 |airdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> Kyubey reveals to Madoka that he is of an alien race that has been harvesting the emotions of magical girls for centuries to use as energy to counteract the spread of [[entropy]], and thus stave off the [[heat death of the universe]]. Madoka also learns that Homura is a magical girl from a different timeline who has repeated the same month countless times to try to save Madoka from a grisly fate. \n\nMadoka and Kyoko attempt to reverse Sayaka's transformation, but the plan fails and Kyoko is forced to sacrifice herself to allow Madoka to escape, leaving Homura as the only remaining magical girl. Following this, an extremely powerful witch known as Walpurgisnacht approaches the city. Homura attempts to stop it, but is defeated. She prepares to rewind time to repeat the month again, but Madoka stops her. With the past month's events in mind, Madoka decides to become a magical girl and makes a wish to stop the creation of all witches in the past, present, and future. The scope of this wish rewrites history and the laws of the universe, and her existence as a human is erased from time. She transcends into a cosmic phenomenon called \"The Law of Cycles\", which appears to all magical girls at the moment before they become witches and rescues them by taking them to a heavenly paradise. A new reality, in which Homura is the only one who remembers Madoka, is formed.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=My Very Best Friend |series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica |network=[[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] |number=12 |episodelink=List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica episodes#ep12 |airdate=April 21, 2011}}</ref> Homura vows to continue fighting in honor of Madoka.\n\n==Production==\n\nWhile collaborating on ''[[Hidamari Sketch]]'' and ''[[Monogatari (series)|Bakemonogatari]]'', [[Akiyuki Shinbo]] told [[Aniplex]] producer Atsuhiro Iwakami he wanted to create a new magical girl series, beginning the development of ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica''. During the early planning stage, Iwakami decided not to adapt an existing work to give Shinbo more freedom in his direction style.<ref name=\"megami\">{{Cite journal |date=October 25, 2010 |script-title=ja:\u65b0\u623f\u662d\u4e4b\u00d7\u865a\u6df5\u7384\u00d7\u84bc\u6a39\u3046\u3081\u00d7\u30b7\u30e3\u30d5\u30c8 1\u5927\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u59cb\u52d5 |trans-title=Akiyuki Shinbo \u00d7 Gen Urobuchi \u00d7 Ume Aoki \u00d7 Shaft: The Start of One Large Project |journal=[[Megami Magazine]] |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Gakken]] |issue=127 |page=115}}</ref> Another goal of the project was to develop an anime that would appeal to a wider audience than the usual demographic for media within the magical girl subgenre.

Because ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica'' is an original series rather than an adaptation of an existing work, his main goal was \"coming up with a high-quality piece of entertainment\". After helping to recruit the staff, he allowed them freedom to develop the content of the story, providing minimal guidance. After viewing the character designs that Aoki created, he was sure he could trust the creative talent of the team. In an interview with [[Anime News Network]] after the series finished airing in Japan, Iwakami said, \"I don't matter much; it's up to those talents to do their work. If something comes to a stand-still I might intervene, but they did an excellent job and I was very happy seeing the results in episode one.\"<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\" />\n\n===Writing===\nDuring the pre-writing planning phase, Iwakami asked Urobuchi to make the storyline \"heavy\".<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\" /> Shinbo specified it should contain copious amounts of blood and violence, elements that were unusual in the magical girl genre. Iwakami also asked for many of the magical girl characters to be killed throughout the series.<ref name=\"AsahiInterview\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-08-30/madoka-magica-writer-urobuchi-compares-plot-to-al-qaeda |title=''Madoka Magica'' Writer Urobuchi Compares Plot to Al-Qaeda |last=Loo |first=Egan |date=August 8, 2011 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |access-date=May 6, 2014}}</ref> Urobuchi said he had no trouble with these requirements, referencing his past reputation as a writer of very dark and somber stories, the extent of which Shinbo had not known.<ref name=\"4Gamer\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/130/G013023/20110617067/ |last=Kajita |first=Mafia |date=June 17, 2011 |publisher=4Gamer.net |language=Japanese |script-title=ja:\u9b3c\u54ed\u8857\u300d\u304b\u3089\u300c\u6c99\u8036\u306e\u5504\u300d\u300c\u9b54\u6cd5\u5c11\u5973\u307e\u3069\u304b\u2606\u30de\u30ae\u30ab\u300d\u307e\u3067\u30df\u30c3\u30c1\u30ea\u8cea\u554f\u653b\u3081\uff01 |trans-title=Very hard barrage of questions from ''Kikoku street'', ''Song of Saya'' to ''Magical Girl Madoka \u2606 Magika''! |access-date=May 8, 2014}}</ref> \n\nOne objective was for the script to contrast starkly with the way the anime was to be marketed. Shinbo planned to advertise the series in an innocent and pure manner that would deliberately conceal its dark undertones.<ref name=\"UltraJumpEgg\">{{Cite web |url=http://ultrajumpegg.com/#/column/0004/0029/02 |title=\u811a\u672c\u5bb6\u3000\u865a\u6df5\u7384\u3055\u3093\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3000\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u672c\u8a8c\u300eULTRA NEXT\u300f\u5897\u88dc\u7248 |date=July 27, 2011 |publisher=[[Ultra Jump#History|Ultra Jump Egg]] |language=Japanese |trans-title=Interview with scriptwriter Gen Urobuchi - ''Ultra Jump'' 'Ultra Next' extended version |access-date=May 6, 2013}}</ref> For example, the title logo was rendered using rounded fonts that would appear harmless to audiences. Urobuchi further misled fans by using his [[Twitter]] account to persuade them the plot of the series was innocuous. The true nature of the series was disguised because Shinbo wanted its dark themes to be a complete surprise to the viewers.<ref name=\"4Gamer\" /> Iwakami later defended the mature themes in the ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica'', stating, \"the story of ''Madoka'' is serious but it's not entirely inappropriate for children. For example, there's nothing sexually explicit in it. There's some death, but it's not gratuitous; it can be explained within the context of the story.\"<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\" />\n\nShinbo granted Urobuchi a large amount of autonomy in writing the series and determining the path of the story.<ref name=\"KoikeAndUrobuchi\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-01-29 |title=Report: Kazuo Koike and Gen Urobuchi Chat |last=Ransom |first=Ko |date=January 29, 2012 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref> In describing his interactions with Iwakami and Shinbo while working on the series, Urobuchi commented that \"neither one is the type to show their hand, they would always wait for me to make the next move\".<ref name=\"UrobuchiFocusPanel\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2012/otakon/4 |title=Gen Urobuchi Focus panel |last=Sevakis |first=Justin |date=July 27, 2012 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |access-date=May 8, 2014}}</ref> To create a successful deconstruction of the magical girl genre, Urobuchi studied aspects of traditional magical girl media that were \"troubling or overlooked\".<ref name=\"AsahiInterview\" /> He also stated the plot development was heavily influenced by the character drawings by Aoki. He also credited  [[horror fiction]] author [[Stephen King]] and Shinbo's previous projects such as ''[[Hidamari Sketch]]'' and ''[[Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha]]'' as inspirations for the series.<ref name=\"KoikeAndUrobuchi\" />\n\nUrobuchi attributed his past experience working on projects with screenwriters Ichiro Itano and [[Y\u014dsuke Kuroda]] as a major influence in his writing for ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica'', and has referred to both of them as his mentors.<ref name=\"UrobuchiFocusPanel\" /> To set the initial pacing of the series, Urobuchi used a technique he credited to Kuroda. The first episode would throw the viewer into a specific part of the story with unknown context, the second episode would define the rules governing the story's setting, and the third episode would divulge the revelation in the plot to hook the viewer.<ref name=\"KoikeAndUrobuchi\" /> The twist in the third episode was determined during the project proposal stage and involves the death of Mami, a main character. This decision was controversial; Urobuchi said production staff continually approached him and asked him to reconsider because of their fondness for the character. He refused and the plot remained unchanged during production. Urobuchi realized this progression could be very hard for viewers to accept and might hurt the overall series' success with some audiences; he said, \"I always thought this is an age where entertainment basically is about soothing and healing, like adopting a style where unchanging day-to-day life is to continue forever\".<ref name=\"UltraJumpEgg\" />\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Ultra Jump#History|Ultra Jump Egg]]'', Urobuchi gave insight into his writing philosophy, stating that he believed the overarching plot of a story was more important than the characters in it. He said he would first determine the actions and the ultimate fate of a character before even assigning it a name, and contrasted this with other writing methods that first focused on developing the characters and then creating a storyline for them to follow. He again defended his decision to have Mami die, saying this could have the effect of making the character more memorable, saying, \"I think there are quite many characters who became immortal exactly because they died, like [[Caesar Zeppeli]] in ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' or [[Raoh]] in ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''. Precisely because of the way they died, they were able to live forever.\"<ref name=\"UltraJumpEgg\" />\n\n===Character design===\n[[File:Madokacharacters.jpg|thumb|From left to right: Kyoko Sakura, Sayaka Miki, Madoka Kaname, Kyubey (in lap), Homura Akemi (standing), and Mami Tomoe]]\n\nUrobuchi stated that Sayaka was his favorite character overall and said her plotline was the most enjoyable to write.<ref name=\"AnimagiC2013\">{{Cite interview |last=Urobuchi |first=Gen |title=Nitro+ Q&A Panel |work=[[AnimagiC]] 2013 |place=Bonn, Germany |date=July 27, 2013 |subjectlink=Gen Urobuchi}}</ref> Because of her grim fate by the end of the series, a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair, he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so Sayaka could be spared. Urobuchi declined, saying her death was integral to the overarching story.<ref name=\"UrobuchiFocusPanel\" /> Shinbo then asked if she could be brought back to life, saying he had become very attached to the character. Urobuchi again refused, saying this would be impossible because of the already-established rules governing the story.<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\" /> Shinbo acquiesced to this but said he believed there may have been too large a burden placed on the characters who were young, middle-school girls.<ref name=\"UrobuchiFocusPanel\" />\n\nThe alien character Kyubey was also envisioned and designed by Urobuchi. Iwakami stated that as one of the primary antagonists in the series, \"the mash-up of cuteness and darkness is the central theme to ''Madoka'', and Kyubey is an epitome of that theme\".<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\" /> A central goal in Urobuchi's writing was to highlight the moral and ethical dissonance between Kyubey and the young middle school girls, which was done through actions such as Kyubey eating its own corpse to recycle energy.<ref name=\"KoikeAndUrobuchi\" /> He compared the character to monsters in the works of horror fiction author [[H. P. Lovecraft]], commenting of Kyubey: \"he isn't evil, it is his lack of feelings that make him scary\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2012/sakura-con/6 |title=Gen Urobuchi, Katsushi Ota and Atsuhiro Iwakami Q&A |last=Lamb |first=Lynzee |date=April 6, 2012 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |access-date=May 12, 2014}}</ref> Urobuchi also remarked upon the moral ambiguity the series displays in an interview with ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', stating \"Al-Qaeda brought down the Twin Towers due to their self-righteousness. Justice for some people is an evil for others. Good intentions, kindness, and hope will not necessarily make people happy.\"<ref name=\"AsahiInterview\" />\n\nDue to unforeseen scheduling problems with Shaft, production of the series was postponed for three years following the completion of its writing. Once the issues were resolved, production began without further complications.<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\" /> The animation studio led the conception and design of the witches, and created each one's individual backstory.<ref name=\"UrobuchiFocusPanel\" /> Urobuchi had originally envisioned the witches to be similar to conventional monsters such as [[Godzilla]], but upon seeing the surreal concept art for one of the main witches, Walpurgis Night, he said; \"How can Homura possibly fight against something like this?\" Designers from Shaft added quotations from the German folklorist [[Faust]] to the series.<ref name=\"AnimagiC2013\" /> Throughout production, the animation production team [[Gekidan Inu Curry]] had freedom to insert new details and to modify existing ones from the original script; for example, during a scene in the final episode in which the team added black wings to Homura\u2014something that was not included in Urobuchi's writing.

The story follows a group of female middle school students who choose to become [[magical girl]]s, subsequently battling surreal enemies known as \"witches.\" In consequence, they learn of the anguish and peril associated with their new role.\n\nThe first ten episodes of the series aired in Japan on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] and [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] between January and March 2011, while the final two episodes were delayed until April 2011 due to the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. A [[manga]] adaptation of the series and various spin-off manga series have been published by [[Houbunsha]] and licensed in North America by [[Yen Press]]. A novelization by [[Nitroplus]] was released in August 2011, and a dedicated magazine titled ''Manga Time Kirara Magica'' was launched by Houbunsha in June 2012.</onlyinclude> A video game for the [[PlayStation Portable]] was released in March 2012 and another for [[PlayStation Vita]] was released in December 2013.

A [[smartphone]] game, ''[[Magia Record]]'', launched in August 2017, and an anime adaptation premiered in January 2020.\n\n''Puella Magi Madoka Magica'' has received widespread critical acclaim; critics praised the complex narrative, visuals, artistic direction, and soundtrack of the series as well as its unconventional approach to the magical girl subgenre. It became a commercial success; each [[Blu-ray Disc]] volume sold more than 50,000 copies in Japan. The series garnered a variety of awards, such as the Television Award at the 16th [[Animation Kobe]] Awards, as well as 12 ''[[Newtype]]'' Anime Awards and the Grand Prize for animation in the 2011 [[Japan Media Arts Festival|Japan Media Arts awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica characters}}\n\nIn the fictional city of Mitakihara, Japan, a middle school student named [[Madoka Kaname]] and her friend [[List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica characters#Sayaka Miki|Sayaka Miki]] encounter a small, cat-like creature named [[List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica characters#Kyubey|Kyubey]].

Meanwhile, a transfer student and magical girl named [[Homura Akemi]] tries to stop Madoka from making the contract with Kyubey. Madoka and Sayaka then meet [[Mami Tomoe]], an [[upperclassman]] at the same school who is also a magical girl. Noticing their indecisiveness on whether to become a magical girl, Mami offers to take Madoka and Sayaka along on her witch hunts so they may learn of the responsibilities that come with being a magical girl.<ref>{{cite episode | title = That Would Be Truly Wonderful | episodelink = List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica episodes#ep2 | series = Puella Magi Madoka Magica | network = [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] | airdate = January 14, 2011 | number = 2}}</ref>\n\nHowever, after witnessing Mami's death at the hands of a witch, Madoka realizes the life of a magical girl is filled with danger, anguish, and suffering.<ref>{{cite episode | title = I'm Not Afraid of Anything Anymore | episodelink = List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica episodes#ep3 | series = Puella Magi Madoka Magica | network = [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] | airdate = January 21, 2011 | number = 3}}</ref> This is further enforced by the appearance of [[List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica characters#Kyoko Sakura|Kyoko Sakura]], a veteran magical girl whose wish indirectly caused the death of her family. Madoka also discovers magical girls give up their souls to form their Soul Gems, the source of their magic, and that when Soul Gems become too tainted with despair, magical girls change into witches. \n\nSayaka decides to become a magical girl after learning that doing so would allow her to heal a young musician who she admires. However, her classmate Hitomi Shizuki confesses to him first, causing Sayaka to become disillusioned and fall into an inescapable despair that turns her into a witch.<ref>{{cite episode | title = I Was Stupid, So Stupid | episodelink = List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica episodes#ep8 | series = Puella Magi Madoka Magica | network = [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] | airdate = February 25, 2011 | number = 8}}</ref> Kyubey reveals to Madoka that he is of an alien race that has been harvesting the emotions of magical girls for centuries to use as energy to counteract the spread of [[entropy]], and thus stave off the [[heat death of the universe]]. Madoka also learns that Homura is a magical girl from a different timeline who has repeated the same month countless times to try to save Madoka from a grisly fate. \n\nMadoka and Kyoko attempt to reverse Sayaka's transformation, but the plan fails and Kyoko is forced to sacrifice herself to allow Madoka to escape, leaving Homura as the only remaining magical girl. Following this, an extremely powerful witch known as Walpurgisnacht approaches the city. Homura attempts to stop it, but is defeated. She prepares to rewind time to repeat the month again, but Madoka stops her. With the past month's events in mind, Madoka decides to become a magical girl and makes a wish to stop the creation of all witches in the past, present, and future. The scope of this wish rewrites history and the laws of the universe, and her existence as a human is erased from time. She transcends into a cosmic phenomenon called \"The Law of Cycles\", which appears to all magical girls at the moment before they become witches and rescues them by taking them to a heavenly paradise. A new reality, in which Homura is the only one who remembers Madoka, is formed.<ref>{{cite episode | title = My Very Best Friend | episodelink = List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica episodes#ep12 | series = Puella Magi Madoka Magica | network = [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] | airdate = April 21, 2011 | number = 12}}</ref> Homura vows to continue fighting in honor of Madoka.\n\n==Production==\n\nWhile collaborating on ''[[Hidamari Sketch]]'' and ''[[Monogatari (series)|Bakemonogatari]]'', [[Akiyuki Shinbo]] told [[Aniplex]] producer Atsuhiro Iwakami he wanted to create a new magical girl series, beginning the development of ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica''. During the early planning stage, Iwakami decided not to adapt an existing work to give Shinbo more freedom in his direction style.<ref name=\"megami\">{{cite journal|journal=[[Megami Magazine]]|script-title=ja:\u65b0\u623f\u662d\u4e4b\u00d7\u865a\u6df5\u7384\u00d7\u84bc\u6a39\u3046\u3081\u00d7\u30b7\u30e3\u30d5\u30c8 1\u5927\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u59cb\u52d5|trans-title=Akiyuki Shinbo \u00d7 Gen Urobuchi \u00d7 Ume Aoki \u00d7 Shaft: The Start of One Large Project|issue=127|publisher=[[Gakken]]|date=October 25, 2010|page=115|language=Japanese}}</ref> Another goal of the project was to develop an anime that would appeal to a wider audience than the usual demographic for media within the magical girl subgenre. Iwakami and Shinbo intended their series to be accessible to \"the general anime fan\".<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2011-09-07/interview-atsuhiro-iwakami|title=Interview: Atushio Iwakami|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|first=Gia|last=Manry|date=September 7, 2011|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref> Shinbo then asked [[Gen Urobuchi]] to work on the project as a scriptwriter and [[Ume Aoki]] as a character designer.<ref name=\"megami\"/> Takahiro Kishida was engaged to adapt Aoki's character designs for the television series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-10-28/magica-anime-adds-composer-kajiura-durarara-kishida|title=''Magica'' Anime Adds Composer Kajiura, Durarara's Kishida|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=October 28, 2010|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn his role as producer, Iwakami took a mostly hands-off approach. Because ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica'' is an original series rather than an adaptation of an existing work, his main goal was \"coming up with a high-quality piece of entertainment\". After helping to recruit the staff, he allowed them freedom to develop the content of the story, providing minimal guidance. After viewing the character designs that Aoki created, he was sure he could trust the creative talent of the team. In an interview with [[Anime News Network]] after the series finished airing in Japan, Iwakami said, \"I don't matter much; it's up to those talents to do their work. If something comes to a stand-still I might intervene, but they did an excellent job and I was very happy seeing the results in episode one.\"<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nDuring the pre-writing planning phase, Iwakami asked Urobuchi to make the storyline \"heavy\".<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\"/> Shinbo specified it should contain copious amounts of blood and violence, elements that were unusual in the magical girl genre. Iwakami also asked for many of the magical girl characters to be killed throughout the series.<ref name=\"AsahiInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-08-30/madoka-magica-writer-urobuchi-compares-plot-to-al-qaeda|title=''Madoka Magica'' Writer Urobuchi Compares Plot to Al-Qaeda|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|first=Egan|last=Loo|date=August 8, 2011|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}</ref> Urobuchi said he had no trouble with these requirements, referencing his past reputation as a writer of very dark and somber stories, the extent of which Shinbo had not known.<ref name=\"4Gamer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/130/G013023/20110617067/|script-title=ja:\u9b3c\u54ed\u8857\u300d\u304b\u3089\u300c\u6c99\u8036\u306e\u5504\u300d\u300c\u9b54\u6cd5\u5c11\u5973\u307e\u3069\u304b\u2606\u30de\u30ae\u30ab\u300d\u307e\u3067\u30df\u30c3\u30c1\u30ea\u8cea\u554f\u653b\u3081\uff01|trans-title=Very hard barrage of questions from ''Kikoku street'', ''Song of Saya'' to ''Magical Girl Madoka \u2606 Magika''!|publisher=4Gamer.net|language=Japanese|first=Mafia|last=Kajita|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=May 8, 2014}}</ref> \n\nOne objective was for the script to contrast starkly with the way the anime was to be marketed. Shinbo planned to advertise the series in an innocent and pure manner that would deliberately conceal its dark undertones.<ref name=\"UltraJumpEgg\">{{cite web|url=http://ultrajumpegg.com/#/column/0004/0029/02|title=\u811a\u672c\u5bb6\u3000\u865a\u6df5\u7384\u3055\u3093\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3000\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u672c\u8a8c\u300eULTRA NEXT\u300f\u5897\u88dc\u7248|publisher=[[Ultra Jump#History|Ultra Jump Egg]]|language=Japanese|trans-title=Interview with scriptwriter Gen Urobuchi - ''Ultra Jump'' 'Ultra Next' extended version|date=July 27, 2011|accessdate=May 6, 2013}}</ref> For example, the title logo was rendered using rounded fonts that would appear harmless to audiences. Urobuchi further misled fans by using his [[Twitter]] account to persuade them the plot of the series was innocuous. The true nature of the series was disguised because Shinbo wanted its dark themes to be a complete surprise to the viewers.<ref name=\"4Gamer\"/> Iwakami later defended the mature themes in the ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica'', stating, \"the story of ''Madoka'' is serious but it's not entirely inappropriate for children. For example, there's nothing sexually explicit in it. There's some death, but it's not gratuitous; it can be explained within the context of the story.\"<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\"/>\n\nShinbo granted Urobuchi a large amount of autonomy in writing the series and determining the path of the story.<ref name=\"KoikeAndUrobuchi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-01-29|title=Report: Kazuo Koike and Gen Urobuchi Chat|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|first=Ko|last=Ransom|date=January 29, 2012|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}</ref> In describing his interactions with Iwakami and Shinbo while working on the series, Urobuchi commented that \"neither one is the type to show their hand, they would always wait for me to make the next move\".<ref name=\"UrobuchiFocusPanel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2012/otakon/4|title=Gen Urobuchi Focus panel|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|first=Justin|last=Sevakis|date=July 27, 2012|accessdate=May 8, 2014}}</ref> To create a successful deconstruction of the magical girl genre, Urobuchi studied aspects of traditional magical girl media that were \"troubling or overlooked\".<ref name=\"AsahiInterview\"/> He also stated the plot development was heavily influenced by the character drawings by Aoki. He also credited  [[horror fiction]] author [[Stephen King]] and Shinbo's previous projects such as ''[[Hidamari Sketch]]'' and ''[[Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha]]'' as inspirations for the series.<ref name=\"KoikeAndUrobuchi\"/>\n\nUrobuchi attributed his past experience working on projects with screenwriters Ichiro Itano and [[Y\u014dsuke Kuroda]] as a major influence in his writing for ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica'', and has referred to both of them as his mentors.<ref name=\"UrobuchiFocusPanel\"/> To set the initial pacing of the series, Urobuchi used a technique he credited to Kuroda. The first episode would throw the viewer into a specific part of the story with unknown context, the second episode would define the rules governing the story's setting, and the third episode would divulge the revelation in the plot to hook the viewer.<ref name=\"KoikeAndUrobuchi\"/> The twist in the third episode was determined during the project proposal stage and involves the death of Mami, a main character. This decision was controversial; Urobuchi said production staff continually approached him and asked him to reconsider because of their fondness for the character. He refused and the plot remained unchanged during production. Urobuchi realized this progression could be very hard for viewers to accept and might hurt the overall series' success with some audiences; he said, \"I always thought this is an age where entertainment basically is about soothing and healing, like adopting a style where unchanging day-to-day life is to continue forever\".<ref name=\"UltraJumpEgg\"/>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Ultra Jump#History|Ultra Jump Egg]]'', Urobuchi gave insight into his writing philosophy, stating that he believed the overarching plot of a story was more important than the characters in it. He said he would first determine the actions and the ultimate fate of a character before even assigning it a name, and contrasted this with other writing methods that first focused on developing the characters and then creating a storyline for them to follow. He again defended his decision to have Mami die, saying this could have the effect of making the character more memorable, saying, \"I think there are quite many characters who became immortal exactly because they died, like [[Caesar Zeppeli]] in ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' or [[Raoh]] in ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''. Precisely because of the way they died, they were able to live forever.\"<ref name=\"UltraJumpEgg\"/>\n\n===Character design===\n[[File:Madokacharacters.jpg|thumb|From left to right: Kyoko Sakura, Sayaka Miki, Madoka Kaname, Kyubey (in lap), Homura Akemi (standing), and Mami Tomoe]]\n\nUrobuchi stated that Sayaka was his favorite character overall and said her plotline was the most enjoyable to write.<ref name=\"AnimagiC2013\">{{cite interview|first=Gen|last=Urobuchi|subjectlink=Gen Urobuchi|title=Nitro+ Q&A Panel|work=[[AnimagiC]] 2013|location=Bonn, Germany|date=July 27, 2013}}</ref> Because of her grim fate by the end of the series, a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair, he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so Sayaka could be spared. Urobuchi declined, saying her death was integral to the overarching story.<ref name=\"UrobuchiFocusPanel\"/> Shinbo then asked if she could be brought back to life, saying he had become very attached to the character. Urobuchi again refused, saying this would be impossible because of the already-established rules governing the story.<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\"/> Shinbo acquiesced to this but said he believed there may have been too large a burden placed on the characters who were young, middle-school girls.<ref name=\"UrobuchiFocusPanel\"/>\n\nThe alien character Kyubey was also envisioned and designed by Urobuchi. Iwakami stated that as one of the primary antagonists in the series, \"the mash-up of cuteness and darkness is the central theme to ''Madoka'', and Kyubey is an epitome of that theme\".<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\"/> A central goal in Urobuchi's writing was to highlight the moral and ethical dissonance between Kyubey and the young middle school girls, which was done through actions such as Kyubey eating its own corpse to recycle energy.<ref name=\"KoikeAndUrobuchi\"/> He compared the character to monsters in the works of horror fiction author [[H. P. Lovecraft]], commenting of Kyubey: \"he isn't evil, it is his lack of feelings that make him scary\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2012/sakura-con/6|title=Gen Urobuchi, Katsushi Ota and Atsuhiro Iwakami Q&A|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|first=Lynzee|last=Lamb|date=April 6, 2012|accessdate=May 12, 2014}}</ref> Urobuchi also remarked upon the moral ambiguity the series displays in an interview with ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', stating \"Al-Qaeda brought down the Twin Towers due to their self-righteousness. Justice for some people is an evil for others. Good intentions, kindness, and hope will not necessarily make people happy.\"<ref name=\"AsahiInterview\"/>\n\nDue to unforeseen scheduling problems with Shaft, production of the series was postponed for three years following the completion of its writing. Once the issues were resolved, production began without further complications.<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\"/> The animation studio led the conception and design of the witches, and created each one's individual backstory.<ref name=\"UrobuchiFocusPanel\"/> Urobuchi had originally envisioned the witches to be similar to conventional monsters such as [[Godzilla]], but upon seeing the surreal concept art for one of the main witches, Walpurgis Night, he said; \"How can Homura possibly fight against something like this?\" Designers from Shaft added quotations from the German folklorist [[Faust]] to the series.<ref name=\"AnimagiC2013\"/> Throughout production, the animation production team [[Gekidan Inu Curry]] had freedom to insert new details and to modify existing ones from the original script; for example, during a scene in the final episode in which the team added black wings to Homura\u2014something that was not included in Urobuchi's writing. Urobuchi praised this aspect of the production, commenting, \"additions by the animation production team added more mystery and depth to [the] characters, and without them, it would have been very difficult to write any further stories in the world of the series\".<ref name=\"KoikeAndUrobuchi\"/>\n\n===Music===\nIwakami and Shinbo recruited [[Yuki Kajiura]] to compose the soundtrack for the series after Urobuchi recommended her. Shinbo had previously worked with Kajiura on ''[[Le Portrait de Petit Cossette]]''; Urobuchi told of the inspirational effect the music from that series had on him while writing parts of the script. Urobuchi said he had long been a fan of Kajiura's anime soundtracks and  praised her work ethic, saying she would always familiarize herself with the story's plotline while composing for it.<ref name=\"UrobuchiFocusPanel\"/> [[J-pop|Japanese pop music]] duo [[ClariS]] was also commissioned to perform the series' opening theme {{nihongo|\"[[Connect (ClariS song)|Connect]]\"|\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30c8|Konekuto}}.<ref name=\"OpeningAndEndingThemes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-12-09/noragaki-puella-magi-madoka-magica-promos-streamed|title=''Noragaki'', ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica'' Promos Streamed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 9, 2010|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}</ref> Iwakami involved himself in the song's development to ensure it would fit with the series, marking one of the few times he intervened in an aspect of the production.<ref name=\"IwakamiInterview\"/> Both \"Connect\" and the ending theme \"[[Magia (Kalafina song)|Magia]]\" by [[Kalafina]] were revealed in a television commercial several weeks before the series' premiere in Japan.<ref name=\"OpeningAndEndingThemes\"/>\n\n==Broadcast and distribution==\n{{see also|List of Puella Magi Madoka Magica episodes}}\n[[File:MadokaBluRayBoxSet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blu-ray]] Box Set for the anime series.]]\n\nOn January 7, 2011, ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica'' debuted on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]] (MBS), [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] (TBS), and [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting]] (CBC) in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nitroplus.co.jp/news/2011/01/110107_1884.php|script-title=ja:\"\u865a\u6df5\u7384\"\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u69cb\u6210\u30fb\u811a\u672c \u300c\u9b54\u6cd5\u5c11\u5973\u307e\u3069\u304b\u2606\u30de\u30ae\u30ab\u300d\u653e\u9001\u958b\u59cb\uff01|publisher=[[Nitroplus]]|trans-title=\"Kyofuchigen\" series composition and screenplay \"Magical Girl Madoka\u2606Magika\" starts broadcasting!|language=Japanese|date=January 7, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701170547/http://www.nitroplus.co.jp/news/2011/01/110107_1884.php|archivedate=July 1, 2014}}</ref> The first ten episodes aired weekly without interruption and were made available for streaming on [[Nico Nico Douga]] and [[BIGLOBE]]'s Anime One service.

Citing particularly challenging drawings for episodes 11 and 12, Urobuchi and Iwakami planned to have Shaft continue to improve the episodes up until their rescheduled broadcasts.

He said Shaft was always pressed for time during the production process and only just completed each episode before its air time.

Tarim, along with other American and Turkish-American graduate students, wrote a charter school proposal and received approval from the Texas Education Agency in April 2000, months before the first campus opened in August.\n\nWithin ten years, Harmony expanded to thirty-three campuses across the state, reaching as far as El Paso and Dallas. Now{{When|date=June 2017}} at seventeen years and 54 campuses, Harmony has reached its goal of operating fifty schools and educating 35,000 students by 2020.\n\n==Academic performance==\nHarmony Public Schools works to break down the educational barriers for low-socioeconomic students in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields. Its project-based learning method and STEM SOS model requires students to complete multiple hands-on projects per year in select fields, then present their findings to the community. This motivates students to master complex academic concepts and gives them practice at lifelong skills, such as public speaking and communications.<ref>http://www.cosmostx.org/AboutUs.aspx</ref>\n\nEvery Harmony campus passed or exceeded the state's academic standards in 2016, with six of its campuses earning all seven available academic distinctions and two of its districts earning the post-secondary readiness distinction.\n\nIn 2011 the [[Texas Education Agency]] (TEA) rated 21 of the 33 Harmony schools as \"Exemplary\" or \"Recognized\", while the remainder were \"Acceptable\".<ref name=\"KastnerDiscord1\">Kastner, Lindsay. \"Harmony schools causing discord.\" ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]''.
