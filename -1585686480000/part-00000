It was the second highest-grossing film of 2004 behind ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' and was declared a hit. Khan was subsequently nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2005. He also starred alongside [[Amrita Arora]] in a music video called Disco 82 Remix by DJ Aqeel for UMI-10.\n\nKhan had 4 releases in 2005. He played an obsessive lover in ''[[Vaada (film)|Vaada]]'' alongside [[Arjun Rampal]] and [[Ameesha Patel]]. He then starred in ''[[Shabd (film)|Shabd]]'' as a photography professor, which he was very excited about because he had always wanted to do a film with [[Aishwarya Rai]]. His third release, [[Anubhav Sinha]]'s action thriller ''[[Dus]]'', where he played a cop, did well. It was Big Hit and was the third highest-grossing film of 2005. Khan's final release of the year, ''[[Shaadi No. 1]]'', flopped at the box office.\n\nHe starred in [[Sohail Khan]]'s action multi-starrer, ''[[Fight Club - Members Only]]'' in 2006. Next, he appeared in ''[[Rocky: The Rebel]]''. Khan revealed that he had ghost-written some scenes in the film. He had first begun script-writing when he was studying in London.\n\nBoth of his films in 2007 were action multi-starrers. Anubhav Sinha's ''[[Cash (2007 film)|Cash]]'' was originally meant to be the sequel to Dus, but ended up differently. Due to this, some of the cast of Dus also star in Cash. It performed reasonably well in its first week, but was unable to replicate the success of Dus and was eventually declared a flop. His next film, ''[[Speed (2007 film)|Speed]]'', also failed at the box office.\n\nIn 2008, Khan had the leading role as a news reporter in [[Apoorva Lakhia]]'s ''[[Mission Istaanbul]]'' opposite [[Vivek Oberoi]].

At the time of its release, the film broke the record for having the highest budget for a Bollywood film. It had an excellent opening weekend on [[Diwali]], collecting {{INR}}480&nbsp;million, but was a below-average grosser. He also filmed ''[[Sharafat Gayi Tel Lene]]'', a comedy thriller film. However, it ran into production hassles and is yet to be released.\n\nKhan had a special appearance as an unfaithful fianc\u00e9 in the 2010 [[Ranbir Kapoor]]\u2013[[Priyanka Chopra]] starrer, ''[[Anjaana Anjaani]]''.\n\nIn 2011, the actor ventured into production with his co-owned production house, Born Free Entertainment along with friend and actress [[Dia Mirza]] and her husband, Sahil Sanga. Their first film, ''[[Love Breakups Zindagi]]'', was released on 7 October 2011, and was met with a lukewarm response.\n\nIn 2012, Khan played a supporting role in ''[[Tezz]]'', which stars Anil Kapoor and [[Ajay Devgan]] in the lead.

This is one of many steps in the process of converting certain [[amino acids]] and fats into energy. Individuals with PA cannot perform this conversion because the enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase is nonfunctional. The essential amino acids [[valine]], [[methionine]], [[isoleucine]], and [[threonine]], as well as odd-chain [[fatty acids]] (hence the mnemonic \"VOMIT\"), are simply converted to propionyl-CoA, before the process stops, leading to a buildup of propionyl-CoA and other toxic chemicals. Instead of being converted to methylmalonyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA is then converted into [[propionic acid]], which builds up in the bloodstream. This in turn causes an accumulation of dangerous acids and toxins, which can cause damage to the organs.\n\nIn many cases, propionic acidemia can damage the brain, heart, kidney, liver, cause seizures and delays to normal development like walking or talking. During times of illness the affected person may need to be hospitalized to prevent breakdown of proteins within the body. Dietary needs must be closely managed by a metabolic [[geneticist]] or metabolic [[dietician]].\n\nMutations in both copies of the ''[[Propionyl-CoA carboxylase|PCCA]]'' or ''[[PCCB]]'' [[gene]]s cause propionic acidemia.<ref name=\"pamr\">[http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/barry_lab/ropionic-Aciademia.cfm http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/barry_lab/ropionic-Aciademia.cfm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829225331/http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/barry_lab/ropionic-Aciademia.cfm |date=2008-08-29 }}<br />Barry Lab - Vector and Virus Engineering.

Mutations in the ''PCCA'' or ''PCCB'' genes disrupt the function of the enzyme, preventing these acids from being metabolized. As a result, [[propionyl-CoA]], propionic acid, [[ketones]], [[ammonia]], and other [[toxic]] compounds accumulate in the [[blood]], causing the signs and symptoms of propionic [[acidemia]].\n\n==Diagnosis==\nElevated metabolites of propionic acid (for example, 3-hydroxypropionate, methylcitrate, tiglylglycine, propionylglycine) found in blood and urine along with normal biotinidase levels.<ref>{{Citation|last=Shchelochkov|first=Oleg A.|title=Propionic Acidemia|date=1993|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92946/|work=GeneReviews\u00ae|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Margaret P.|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle|pmid=22593918|access-date=2019-09-29|last2=Carrillo|first2=Nuria|last3=Venditti|first3=Charles|editor2-last=Ardinger|editor2-first=Holly H.|editor3-last=Pagon|editor3-first=Roberta A.|editor4-last=Wallace|editor4-first=Stephanie E.}}</ref>\n\n==Management==\nPatients with propionic acidemia should be started as early as possible on a low protein diet.

This is one of many steps in the process of converting certain [[amino acids]] and fats into energy. Individuals with PA cannot perform this conversion because the enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase is nonfunctional. The essential amino acids [[valine]], [[methionine]], [[isoleucine]], and [[threonine]], as well as odd-chain [[fatty acids]] (hence the mnemonic \"VOMIT\"), are simply converted to propionyl-CoA, before the process stops, leading to a buildup of propionyl-CoA and other toxic chemicals. Instead of being converted to methylmalonyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA is then converted into [[propionic acid]], which builds up in the bloodstream. This in turn causes an accumulation of dangerous acids and toxins, which can cause damage to the organs.\n\nIn many cases, propionic acidemia can damage the brain, heart, kidney, liver, cause seizures and delays to normal development like walking or talking. During times of illness the affected person may need to be hospitalized to prevent breakdown of proteins within the body. Dietary needs must be closely managed by a metabolic [[geneticist]] or metabolic [[dietician]].\n\nMutations in both copies of the ''[[Propionyl-CoA carboxylase|PCCA]]'' or ''[[PCCB]]'' [[gene]]s cause propionic acidemia.<ref name=\"pamr\">[http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/barry_lab/ropionic-Aciademia.cfm http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/barry_lab/ropionic-Aciademia.cfm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829225331/http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/barry_lab/ropionic-Aciademia.cfm |date=2008-08-29 }}<br />Barry Lab - Vector and Virus Engineering. ''Gene therapy for Propionic Acidemia''</ref> These genes contain instructions to form alpha- and beta-subunits of PCC, the [[enzyme]] called [[propionyl-CoA carboxylase]] ({{EC number|6.4.1.3}}).\n\nPCC is required for the normal breakdown of the essential amino acids valine, isoleucine, threonine, and methionine, as well as certain odd-chained fatty-acids. Mutations in the ''PCCA'' or ''PCCB'' genes disrupt the function of the enzyme, preventing these acids from being metabolized. As a result, [[propionyl-CoA]], propionic acid, [[ketones]], [[ammonia]], and other [[toxic]] compounds accumulate in the [[blood]], causing the signs and symptoms of propionic [[acidemia]].\n\n==Diagnosis==\nElevated metabolites of propionic acid (for example, 3-hydroxypropionate, methylcitrate, tiglylglycine, propionylglycine) found in blood and urine along with normal biotinidase levels.<ref>{{Citation|last=Shchelochkov|first=Oleg A.|title=Propionic Acidemia|date=1993|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92946/|work=GeneReviews\u00ae|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Margaret P.|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle|pmid=22593918|access-date=2019-09-29|last2=Carrillo|first2=Nuria|last3=Venditti|first3=Charles|editor2-last=Ardinger|editor2-first=Holly H.|editor3-last=Pagon|editor3-first=Roberta A.|editor4-last=Wallace|editor4-first=Stephanie E.}}</ref>\n\n==Management==\nPatients with propionic acidemia should be started as early as possible on a low protein diet.
