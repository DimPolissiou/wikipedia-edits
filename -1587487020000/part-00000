This word had been used by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] since the 1st century to refer to Great Britain, and more specifically the [[Roman Britain|Roman province of Britain]]. This word derives from a [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word, \u03a0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 (Prettanike) or \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 (Brettaniai), used by [[Pytheas]], an explorer from [[Marseille|Massalia]] who visited the [[British Islands]] around 320 BC. The Greek word itself comes from the common Brythonic ethnonym reconstructed as ''*Pritan\u012b'', itself from Proto-Celtic ''*k\u02b7ritanoi'' (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/k\u02b7er-|''*k\u02b7er-'']] 'to cut, make').\n\nThe Romans called Brittany ''[[Armorica]]''. It was a quite indefinite region that extended along the [[English Channel]] coast from the [[Seine]] estuary, then along the Atlantic coast to the [[Loire]] estuary and, according to several sources, maybe to the [[Garonne]] estuary. This term probably comes from a [[Gallic language|Gallic]] word, ''aremorica'', which means \"close to the sea\".<ref>{{Cite book|author=Pierre-Yves Lambert|title=La Langue Gauloise|year=1997|page=34}}</ref> Another name, ''Letauia'' (in English \"[[Litavis]]\"), was used until the 12th century. It possibly means \"wide and flat\" or \"to expand\" and it gave the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for Brittany: ''Llydaw''.<ref>{{Cite book|author=L\u00e9on Fleuriot|title=Les Origines de la Bretagne|publisher=Payot|year=1980|pages=53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], many [[Britons]] settled in western Armorica, and the region started to be called ''Britannia'', although this name only replaced ''Armorica'' in the sixth century or perhaps by the end of the fifth.<ref>{{Cite book|author=L\u00e9on Fleuriot|title=Les Origines de la Bretagne|pages=52\u201353|publisher=Payot|year= 1980}}</ref> Later, authors like [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] used the terms ''Britannia minor'' and ''Britannia major'' to distinguish Brittany from Britain.\n\nBreton-speaking people may pronounce the word ''Breizh'' in two different ways, according to their region of origin. Breton can be divided into two main dialects: the ''KLT'' ([[Cornouaille|Kerne]]-Leon-[[Tr\u00e9gor|Tregor]]) and the dialect of [[Vannes]]. KLT speakers pronounce it {{IPA-br|br\u025bjs|}} and would write it ''Breiz'', while the Vannetais speakers pronounce it {{IPA-br|br\u025b\u03c7|}} and would write it ''Breih''. The official spelling is a compromise between both variants, with a ''z'' and an ''h'' together. In 1941, efforts to unify the dialects led to the creation of the so-called ''Breton zh'', a standard which has never been widely accepted.<ref name=\"Walter\"/> On its side, [[Gallo language]] has never had a widely accepted writing system and several ones coexist. For instance, the name of the region in that language can be written ''Berta\u00e8yn'' in ''ELG'' script, or ''Bert\u00e8gn'' in ''MOGA'', and a couple of other scripts also exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://7seizh.info/2013/04/23/bertaeyn-galeizz-change-de-nom-un-evenement-pas-si-anodin/|title=Berta\u00e8yn Galeizz change de nom.

After the [[last glacial period]], the warmer climate allowed the area to become heavily wooded. At that time, Brittany was populated by relatively large communities who started to change their lifestyles from a life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers. Agriculture was introduced during the [[5th millennium BC]] by migrants from the south and east. However, the [[Neolithic Revolution]] in Brittany did not happen due to a radical change of population, but by slow immigration and exchange of skills.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Julian|date=2004-12-01|title=Current debates on the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in Britain and Ireland|journal=Documenta Praehistorica|volume=31|pages=<!-- 113\u2013130 -->|at=p. 117|doi=10.4312/dp.31.8|issn=1854-2492|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nNeolithic Brittany is characterised by important [[megalithic architectural elements|megalithic production]] and sites such as [[Quelf\u00e9nnec]], it is sometimes designated as the \"core area\" of megalithic culture.<ref>Mark Patton, ''Statements in Stone: Monuments and Society in Neolithic Brittany'', Routledge, 1993, p.1</ref> The oldest monuments, [[cairn]]s, were followed by princely tombs and [[stone row]]s.

They gave their name to the city of [[Rennes]] (''Roazhon'' in Breton language, in the center of the d\u00e9partement) and to the town of [[Redon]] (in the south of the ''d\u00e9partement'', bordering the ''d\u00e9partement'' of [[Loire-Atlantique]] in the administrative ''r\u00e9gion'' of [[Pays de la Loire]], where its suburb town of [[Saint-Nicolas-de-Redon]] is located; however the city of Redon was founded around AD 832 under the initial name of ''Riedones'', long after the ''Redones'' people were assimilated to Bretons ; the cultural link between ''Riedones'' and the former ''Redones'' people is highly probable but difficult to recover and the name of ''Riedones'' may have been written from a local usage preserving the name of the former people in the vernacular oral language from a reading of an ancient Greek orthography).\n* The [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]], who lived in the present [[Morbihan]] ''[[d\u00e9partement]]'' and gave their name to the city of [[Vannes]]. Despite confusion by the classical scholar [[Strabo]], they were unrelated to the [[Adriatic Veneti]].\n\nThose people had strong economic ties to the [[Insular Celts]], especially for the [[tin]] trade. Several tribes also belonged to an \"Armorican [[confederation]]\" which, according to [[Julius Caesar]], gathered the [[Curiosolitae]], the [[Redones]], the [[Osismii]], the [[Unelli]], the [[Caletes]], the [[Lemovices]] and the Ambibarii.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Commentarii de Bello Gallico|author=Julius Caesar|page=75|work=VII}}</ref> The last four peoples mentioned by Caesar were respectively located in [[Cotentin]] (Lower-Normandy), [[pays de Caux]] (Upper-Normandy), [[Limousin]] (Aquitany) and the location of the Ambibarii is unknown. The Caletes are sometimes also considered as Belgians and \u2033Lemovices\u2033 is probably a mistake for \u2033[[Lexovii]]\u2033 (Lower-Normandy).\n\n===Gallo-Roman era===\n[[File:Corseul - Temple de Mars 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The temple of Mars in [[Corseul]].]]\nThe region became part of the [[Roman Republic]] in 51 BC. It was included in the province of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]] in 13 BC. Gallic towns and villages were redeveloped according to Roman standards, and several cities were created. These cities are Condate ([[Rennes]]), Vorgium ([[Carhaix]]), Darioritum ([[Vannes]]) and Condevincum or Condevicnum ([[Nantes]]). Together with Fanum Martis ([[Corseul]]), they were the capitals of the local [[civitas|civitates]]. They all had a [[grid plan]] and a [[forum (Roman)|forum]], and sometimes a temple, a [[basilica]], [[thermae]] or an [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]], like [[Carhaix]]. \n\nThe Romans also built three major roads through the region. However, most of the population remained rural. The free peasants lived in small huts, whereas the landowners and their employees lived in proper [[villa rustica|villae rusticae]]. The Gallic deities continued to be worshiped, and were often assimilated to the Roman gods. Only a small number of statues depicting Roman gods were found in Brittany, and most of the time they combine Celtic elements.<ref name=\"roman\">{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ac-rennes.fr/cst/doc/dossiers/archeo/archeo/classique.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040531074132/http://www2.ac-rennes.fr/cst/doc/Dossiers/archeo/archeo/classique.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=31 May 2004|title=Arch\u00e9ologie classique|editor=Universit\u00e9 de Rennes II|accessdate=26 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 3rd century AD, the region was attacked several times by [[Franks]], [[Alamanni]] and pirates. At the same time, the local economy collapsed and many farming estates were abandoned. To face the invasions, many towns and cities were fortified, like [[Nantes]], [[Rennes]] and [[Vannes]].<ref name=\"roman\"/>\n\n[[File:France Pays bretons map.svg|left|upright=1.35|thumb|A [[French language|French]] map of the traditional regions of Brittany in [[Kingdom of France|Ancien R\u00e9gime France]]. The earlier state of [[Domnonia]] or [[Domnon\u00e9e]] that united Brittany comprised the counties along the north coast.]]\n\n===Immigration of Britons===\nToward the end of the 4th century, the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] of what is now Wales and the [[South West Peninsula|South-Western peninsula of Great Britain]] began to emigrate to [[Armorica]]. The history behind such an establishment is unclear, but medieval Breton, Angevin and Welsh sources connect it to a figure known as [[Conan Meriadoc]]. Welsh literary sources assert that Conan came to Armorica on the orders of the Roman usurper [[Magnus Maximus]],{{efn| Magnus Maximus was a native of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in [[Spain]], being born on the estate of [[Count Theodosius]].}} who sent some of his British troops to Gaul to enforce his claims and settled them in Armorica. This account was supported by the Counts of Anjou, who claimed descent from a Roman soldier{{efn|Presumably this soldier was in the employ of [[Gratian]].}} expelled from Lower Brittany by Conan on Magnus's orders. Regardless of the truth of this story, Brythonic (British Celtic) settlement probably increased during the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain]] in the 5th and 6th centuries. \n\nScholars such as [[L\u00e9on Fleuriot]] have suggested a two-wave model of migration from Britain which saw the emergence of an independent Breton people and established the dominance of the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Breton language]] in Armorica.<ref>[[L\u00e9on Fleuriot]], ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l\u2019\u00e9migration'', Paris, Payot, 1980.</ref> Their [[petty kingdom]]s are now known by the names of the French counties that succeeded them\u2014[[Domnon\u00e9e]] ([[Devon]]), [[Cornouaille]] ([[Cornwall]]), [[Viscounty of L\u00e9on|L\u00e9on]] ([[Caerleon]]); but these names in Breton and [[Latin]] are in most cases identical to their British homelands. (In Breton and French, however, [[Gwened (kingdom)|Gwened]] or [[Pays Vannetais|Vannetais]] continued the name of the indigenous [[Veneti (Gauls)|Veneti]].) Although the details remain confused, these colonies consisted of related and intermarried dynasties which repeatedly unified (as by the 7th-century [[Saint Judica\u00ebl]]) before splintering again according to Celtic inheritance practices. \n\nThe area was finally consolidated in the 840s under [[Nominoe]] in resistance to [[Franks|Frank]]ish control.<ref>Smith, Julia M. H. ''Province and Empire: Brittany and the Carolingians'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, pp.80\u201383.</ref> Among the immigrant Britons, there were some clergymen who helped the [[evangelisation]] of the region, which was still pagan, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[[File:Britonia6hcentury.png|thumb|left|The [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] community around the 6th century. The sea was a communication medium rather than a barrier.]]\n\n===Battle of the Catalaunian Plains===\nThe army recruited for [[Flavius Aetius]] to combat [[Attila the Hun]] at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]] included Romans, Visigoths, Franks, Alans and Armoricans, amongst others.  The Alans were placed front and centre, opposite the Huns. The Armoricans supplied archers who attacked the Huns' front lines during the main battle and thwarted Attila's night assault on the Roman camp with a hail of arrows \"like rain\".  After the battle was won, Aetius sent the Alans to Armorica and Galicia.\n\n===Riothamus===\nThe late 5th century Brittonic leader [[Riothamus]] received correspondence from the eminent Roman jurist [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] and was called \"King of the Britons\" by [[Jordanes]].  Some suggest that he was a Breton, though others believe that he was from Britain, pointing to the passage that he arrived in the land of the Biturges \"by way of Ocean\", which would hardly have been efficient or required for a Breton.  Both historians describe Riothamus's losing battle against King [[Euric]] of the Visigoths at [[D\u00e9ols]] around the year 470.  \n\nIn response to a plea from the Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]], Riothamus had led twelve thousand men to establish a military presence in [[Bourges]] in central Gaul, but was betrayed by [[Arvandus]], the Praetorian Prefect of Gaul, and subsequently ambushed by Euric's army.{{efn|The Visigoths' version of events was that they had saved the Roman empire from a British invasion.}} After a long battle, the Armorican survivors escaped to [[Avallon]] in [[Burgundy]], after which they are lost to history.  According to Breton king-lists, Riotham survived and reigned as Prince of [[Domnonia]] until his death sometime between 500 and 520, though this may have been a different person.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Nominoe triumphant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A 1922 nationalist engraving of [[Nominoe]], first king of Brittany.]]\n[[File:Battle of La Roche-Derrien.jpg|Right|thumb|upright|[[Battle of La Roche-Derrien|Battle of Ar Roc'h-Derrien]] during the [[War of the Breton Succession]]]]\nAt the beginning of the medieval era, Brittany was divided between three kingdoms, [[Domnon\u00e9e|Domnonea]], [[Cornouaille]] and [[Bro\u00ebrec]].

His son [[Erispoe]] secured the independence of the new kingdom of Brittany and won the [[Battle of Jengland]] against [[Charles the Bald]]. The Bretons won another war in 867, and the kingdom reached then its maximum extent: it received parts of [[Normandy]], [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]] and [[Anjou]] and the [[Channel Islands]].\n\nBrittany was heavily attacked by the [[Vikings]] at the beginning of the 10th century. The kingdom lost its eastern territories, including [[Normandy]] and [[Anjou]], and the county of [[Nantes]] was given to [[Fulk I, Count of Anjou|Fulk I of Anjou]] in 909. However, Nantes was seized by the Vikings in 914, and was eventually liberated by [[Alan II, Duke of Brittany|Alan II of Brittany]] in 937 with the support of his god-brother King [[\u00c6thelstan]] of England. Alan II totally expelled the Vikings from Brittany and recreated a strong Breton state. He paid homage to [[Louis IV of France]] (who was \u00c6thelstan's nephew and had returned from England in the same year as Alan II) and thus Brittany ceased to be a kingdom and became a duchy.\n\nSeveral Breton lords helped [[William the Conqueror]] to invade England and received large estates there (e.g. William's double-second cousin [[Alan Rufus]] and the latter's brother [[Brian of Brittany]]). Some of these lords were powerful rivals. Medieval Brittany was far from being a united nation. The French king maintained envoys in Brittany, alliances contracted by local lords often overlapped and there was no specific Breton consciousness. For example, Brittany replaced [[Latin]] with French as its official language in the 13th century, 300 years before France did so itself, and the [[Breton language]] never had any formal status. The [[foreign policy]] of the duchy changed many times; the dukes were usually independent but they often contracted alliances with England or France. Their support for each nation became very important during the 14th century, because the English kings then started to claim the French throne.\n\nThe [[Breton War of Succession]], a local episode of the [[Hundred Years' War]], saw the House of [[Blois]], backed by the French, fighting with the House of [[Montfort of Brittany|Montfort]], backed by the English. The Montforts won in 1364 and enjoyed a period of total independence until the end of the Hundred Years' War, because France was weakened and stopped sending royal envoys to the Court of Brittany.  English diplomatic failures led to the Breton cavalry commanders Arthur, Comte de Richemont (later to become [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany]]) and his nephew [[Peter II, Duke of Brittany]] playing key roles on the French side during the deciding stages of the War (the [[Battle of Patay]], the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)]], the [[Battle of Formigny]] and the [[Battle of Castillon]]).  However, Brittany lost the [[Mad War]] against France in 1488, mostly because of its internal divisions which were exacerbated by the corruption at the court of [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]]. Indeed, some Breton lords were fighting on the French side.\n\n===Union with the French Crown and modern period===\n{{main|Union of Brittany and France}}\n[[File:Anne de bretagne.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne of Brittany]] is regarded in Brittany as a conscientious ruler who defended the duchy against France.]]\nAfter the [[Mad War]], the duke [[Francis II of Brittany|Francis II]] could not marry off his daughter [[Anne of Brittany|Anne]] without the King of France's consent. Nonetheless, she married the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1490, but this led to a severe crisis with France. [[Charles VIII of France]] besieged [[Rennes]] and had the marriage cancelled. He eventually married [[Anne of Brittany]]. After he died childless, the duchess had to marry his heir and cousin [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]]. Anne unsuccessfully tried to preserve Breton independence, but she died in 1514 and the union between the two crowns was formally carried out by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1532. He granted several privileges to Brittany, such as exemption from the [[gabelle]], a tax on salt which was very unpopular in France.<ref>Constance De La Warr, ''A Twice Crowned Queen: Anne of Brittany'', Peter Owen, 2005</ref>  Under the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], Brittany and France were governed as separate countries under the same crown, so Breton aristocrats in the French [[Court (royal)|royal court]] were classed as [[Prince \u00e9tranger|Princes \u00e9trangers]] (foreign princes).\n\nFrom the 15th to the 18th century, Brittany reached an economic golden age.{{efn|Brittany was proverbially wealthy throughout much of its history: it prospered from trade before and during Roman rule, mid-ninth century legal documents reveal peasant landowners suing lords for trespass. The House of [[Counts and dukes of Penthi\u00e8vre|Penthi\u00e8vre]] was wealthy, Breton dowries raised impoverished nobles such as [[Jean II de Brosse]] to riches, and Duchess Anne's fortune contributed to the [[French Renaissance]], to palaces such as [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] and to the [[Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley]]}} The region was located on the seaways between Spain, England and the [[Netherlands]] and it greatly benefited from the creation of a [[French colonial empire]]. Local seaports like [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Saint-Brieuc]] quickly expanded, and [[Lorient]], first spelled \"L'Orient\", was founded in the 17th century. [[Saint-Malo]] was then known for its [[French corsairs|corsairs]], Brest was a major base for the [[French Navy]] and [[Nantes]] flourished with the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. On its side, the inland provided [[hemp]] ropes and canvas and [[linen]] sheets. However, [[Colbertism]], which encouraged the creation of many factories, did not favour the Breton industry because most of the royal factories were opened in other provinces. Moreover, several conflicts between France and England led the latter to restrain its trade, and the Breton economy went into recession during the 18th century.\n\nTwo significant revolts occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries: the [[Revolt of the papier timbr\u00e9]] (1675) and the [[Pontcallec conspiracy]] (1719). Both arose from attempts to resist centralisation and assert Breton constitutional exceptions to tax.<ref>Jo\u00ebl Cornette, Le marquis et le R\u00e9gent.

Brittany also lost all its privileges. Three years later, the area became a centre of [[royalist]] and Catholic resistance to the Revolution during the [[Chouannerie]]. During the 19th century, Brittany remained in economic recession, and many Bretons emigrated to other French regions, particularly to Paris. This trend remained strong until the beginning of the 20th century. Nonetheless, the region was also modernising, with new roads and railways being built, and some places being industrialised. [[Nantes]] specialised in [[shipbuilding]] and food processing (sugar, exotic fruits and vegetables, fish...), [[Foug\u00e8res]] in glass and shoe production, and [[metallurgy]] was practised in small towns such as [[Ch\u00e2teaubriant]] and [[Inzinzac-Lochrist|Lochrist]], known for its [[labour movement]]s.\n\nThe region remained deeply Catholic, and during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], the conservative values were strongly reasserted. When the Republic was re-established in 1871, there were rumours that Breton troops were mistrusted and mistreated at [[Camp Conlie]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] because of fears that they were a threat to the Republic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rennes.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/Telechargements/rennais/rn382/histoire.pdf |title=Rennes, guide histoire |format=PDF |accessdate=3 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718175622/http://www.rennes.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/Telechargements/rennais/rn382/histoire.pdf |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:RAF attack Saint Malo 31 Jul 1942.jpg|thumb|A [[Royal Air Force]] attack on [[Saint-Malo]] in 1942.]]\nDuring the 19th century, the [[Breton language]] started to decline precipitously, mainly because of the [[Francization]] policy conducted under the [[Third French Republic|Third Republic]].

It was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940 and freed after [[Operation Cobra]] in August 1944. However, the areas around [[Saint-Nazaire]] and [[Lorient]] only surrendered on 10 and 11 May 1945, several days after the German capitulation. The two port towns had been virtually destroyed by Allied air raids, like [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Saint-Malo]], and other towns, such as [[Nantes]] and [[Rennes]], had also suffered.\n\nIn 1956, Brittany was legally reconstituted as the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Region of Brittany]], although the region excluded the ducal capital of [[Nantes]] and the [[Loire-Atlantique|surrounding area]]. Nevertheless, Brittany retained its cultural distinctiveness, and a new cultural revival emerged during the 1960s and 1970s. Bilingual schools were opened, singers started to write songs in Breton, and ecological catastrophes such as the [[Amoco Cadiz oil spill]] or the [[MV Erika|Erika oil spill]] and water pollution because of intensive pig farming favoured new movements to protect the natural heritage.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{See also|Politics of France}}\n\n===Traditional subdivisions===\n\nBrittany as a political entity disappeared in 1790, when it was divided into five [[d\u00e9partement]]s.

They were often called \"pays\" or \"bro\" (\"country\" in French and [[Breton language|Breton]]) and they also served as fiscal and military districts.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Mikael Bodlore-Penlaez and Divi Kervella|title=Atlas de Bretagne \u2013 Atlas Breizh|publisher=Coop Breizh|year=2011|isbn=978-2-84346-496-6|page=100}}</ref> Brittany is also divided between ''[[Lower Brittany]]'' (\"Basse Bretagne\" and \"Breizh Izel\"), corresponding to the western half, where [[Breton language|Breton]] is traditionally spoken, and ''[[Upper Brittany]]'' (\"Haute Bretagne\" and \"Breizh Uhel\"), corresponding to the eastern half, where [[Gallo language|Gallo]] is traditionally spoken.

When it was an independent duchy, the [[Estates of Brittany]], which can be compared to a parliament, met in various towns: [[Dinan]], [[Plo\u00ebrmel]], [[Redon]], [[Rennes]], [[Vitr\u00e9, Ille-et-Vilaine|Vitr\u00e9]], [[Gu\u00e9rande]], and, most of all, [[Vannes]], where they met 19 times, and [[Nantes]], 17 times. The Court and the government were also very mobile, and each dynasty favoured its own castles and estates. The dukes mostly lived in [[Nantes]], [[Vannes]], [[Redon]], [[Rennes]], [[Foug\u00e8res]], [[Dol-de-Bretagne]], [[Dinan]] and [[Gu\u00e9rande]]. All these towns except Vannes are located in [[Upper Brittany]], thus not in the Breton speaking area.\n\nAmong all these towns, only [[Nantes]], [[Rennes]] and [[Vannes]], which were the biggest ones, could really pretend to the capital status. The dukes were crowned in Rennes and they had a large castle there; it was however destroyed during the 15th century. Vannes, on its side, was the seat of the Chamber of Accounts and of the Parliament until the union with France. The Parliament was then transferred to Rennes, and the Chamber of Accounts to Nantes. Nantes, nicknamed \"the city of the Dukes of Brittany\", was also the permanent residence of the last dukes. The [[Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne]] still stands in the city centre. Nowadays, [[Rennes]] is the only official capital of the [[Brittany (administrative region)|region of Brittany]]. It is also the seat of an [[ecclesiastical province]] encompassing Brittany and the [[Pays de la Loire]] region.\n\n===Present subdivisions===\n{{see also|Administrative divisions of France|Brittany (administrative region)|Loire-Atlantique}}\n[[File:Bretagne historique 2.png|thumb|The [[Brittany (administrative region)|region Brittany]] comprises four historical Breton ''d\u00e9partements''. [[Loire-Atlantique]], in light blue, is part of the [[Pays de la Loire]] region.]]\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], Brittany was divided into five ''[[d\u00e9partement]]s'', each made up of three or four ''[[arrondissements of France|arrondissements]]''. The arrondissements are further divided in [[cantons of France|cantons]], which are themselves made up of one or several [[communes of France|communes]]. The communes and the d\u00e9partements have a local council elected by their citizens, but arrondissements and cantons are not run by elected officials. The cantons serve as an [[electoral]] district for the election of the d\u00e9partement councils and arrondissements are run by a subprefect appointed by the [[President of the French Republic|French president]]. The president also appoints a prefect in each d\u00e9partement.\n\nBecause the d\u00e9partements are small and numerous, the French government tried to create wider regions during the 20th century. For the Breton nationalists, it was an occasion to recreate Brittany as a political and administrative entity, but the new region had to be economically efficient. [[Nantes]] and its ''d\u00e9partement'', [[Loire-Atlantique]], raised concerns because they were off-centered, more integrated with the [[Loire Valley]] than with the Breton peninsula. The French government and local politicians also feared that [[Nantes]], because of its population and its former Breton capital status, would have maintained a harmful competition with [[Rennes]] to get the regional institutions and investments.\n\nSeveral drafts for French regions had been proposed since the 1920s, and the definitive regions were drawn in 1956. The new Brittany had four d\u00e9partements, and [[Loire-Atlantique]] formed the [[Pays de la Loire]] region together with parts of [[Anjou]], [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]] and [[Poitou]]. In 1972, the regions received their present competencies, with an elected regional council. Since then, the [[Brittany (administrative region)|region of Brittany]] has had its own [[Regional Council of Brittany|council]] and administrative bodies.\n\n===Reunification===\n{{see also|Bretagne R\u00e9unie}}\n[[File:Bienvenue en Bretagne historique.jpg|thumb|This [[Loire-Atlantique]] road sign reads \"welcome to historical Brittany\".]]\nWhen the [[Brittany (administrative region)|region of Brittany]] was created, several local politicians opposed the exclusion of [[Loire-Atlantique]], and the question still remains.\n\nThe obstacles to reunification are the same as in 1956: having [[Nantes]] in Brittany could harm the position of [[Rennes]] and create an economic imbalance between [[Lower Brittany|Lower]] and [[Upper Brittany]]. Moreover, the [[Pays de la Loire]] region could not exist without [[Loire-Atlantique]], because it would lose its political and economic capital. Without Loire-Atlantique, the other d\u00e9partements would not form an efficient region any more, and would have to integrate neighbouring regions such as the [[Centre-Val de Loire]] and [[Poitou-Charentes]].\n\nHowever, several institutions have backed the reunification, such as the regional council of Brittany since 2008 and the Loire-Atlantique council since 2001. Some politicians like [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]], the French prime minister and former [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Nantes]], favour instead the creation of a \"Greater West region\", which would encompass Brittany and the [[Pays de la Loire]] region. Polls show that 58% of the Bretons and 62% of the inhabitants in [[Loire-Atlantique]] favour the reunification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/story/47615/bretagne-nantes-guerre-frontieres|title=Bretagne, la guerre des fronti\u00e8res|date=20 December 2011|editor=Slate.fr}}</ref>\n\n===Political tendencies===\n{{main|Politics of Brittany}}\nUntil the end of the 20th century, Brittany had been characterised by a strong Catholic and conservative influence. However, some areas such as the industrial region around [[Saint-Nazaire]] and [[Lorient]] and the surroundings of [[Tr\u00e9guier]] are traditional Socialist and Communist strongholds. Left-wing parties, mainly the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist party]] and [[the Greens (France)|the Greens]], have become more and more powerful after the 1970s and they have formed a majority in the [[Regional Council of Brittany]] since 2004. The [[Loire-Atlantique]] and [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] councils have also been held by the left since 2004. \n\nThe Socialist party has held the [[C\u00f4tes-d'Armor]] council since 1976, and the [[Finist\u00e8re]] council since 1998. On its side, [[Morbihan]] remains a right-wing stronghold. The local parties have a very small audience, except the [[Union D\u00e9mocratique Bretonne]] which has seats at the Regional Council and in other local assemblies. It advocates more autonomy for the region and its positions are very close to the Socialist parties. It also has a strong ecological orientation. The audience of far-right parties is lower in Brittany than in the rest of France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rue89.com/2012/04/04/la-bretagne-terre-de-resistance-lextreme-droite-230769|title=La Bretagne, terre de r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame droite|editor=Rue89|date=4 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and natural history==\n[[File:Bretagne Cote granit rose 01.jpg|thumb|The [[C\u00f4te de Granit Rose|Pink Granite Coast]] around [[Tr\u00e9gastel]].]]\nBrittany is the largest French [[peninsula]]. It is around {{convert|34030|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and stretches towards the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered to the north by the [[English Channel]], to the south by the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the waters located between the western coast and [[Ushant|Ushant island]] form the [[Iroise Sea]].\n\nThe Breton coast is very indented, with many cliffs, [[ria]]s and [[Cape (geography)|cape]]s. The [[Gulf of Morbihan]] is a vast [[natural harbour]] with some forty islands that is almost a closed sea. In total, around 800 islands lie off the mainland; the largest being [[Belle \u00cele]], in the south. Brittany has over {{convert|2860|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline; it represents a third of the total French coastline.\n\nThe region is generally hilly because it corresponds to the western end of the [[Armorican massif]], a very old range that also extends in [[Normandy]] and the [[Pays de la Loire]] region. Because of this continuity, the Breton border with the rest of France is not marked by any strong geographical landmark, apart from the river [[Couesnon]], which separates Brittany from [[Normandy]].\n\n[[File:L'ELLez pr\u00e8s de sa source.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bog]] around the [[Monts d'Arr\u00e9e]].]]\nThe [[Armorican massif]] reaches its maximal elevation outside of Brittany, in neighbouring [[Mayenne]], at 417 m, and slopes towards the west before straightening on its western extremity, with the [[Montagnes Noires]] and the [[Monts d'Arr\u00e9e]]. The highest hill in Brittany is the ''Roc'h Ruz'' in the Monts d'Arr\u00e9e, at {{convert|385|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is closely followed by several neighbouring hills culminating at around 384 m above sea level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.plouneour-menez.fr/fr/patrimoine-naturel.php|title=Le Roc'h RUZ , point culminant de la Bretagne|editor=Ploum\u00e9our-M\u00e9nez}}</ref>\n\nCoastal areas are usually named ''Armor'' or ''Arvor'' (\"by the sea\" in Breton), and the inland is called ''Argoat'' (\"by the forest\"). The best soils were primitively covered by large forests which had been progressively replaced by [[bocage]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. The Breton bocage, with its small fields enclosed by thick hedgerows, has almost disappeared since the 1960s to fit the modern agricultural needs and methods, particularly mechanisation.\n\nSeveral forests still exist, such as the [[Paimpont forest]], sometimes said to be the Arthurian [[Broc\u00e9liande]]. The poor and rocky areas are covered by large [[heathland]] and [[moorland]]s, and Brittany has several [[marsh]]es, like the [[Bri\u00e8re]], included in a [[Regional natural parks of France|regional natural park]]. Another regional park encompasses the [[Monts d'Arr\u00e9e]] and the [[Iroise Sea|Iroise]] seacoast. The Iroise Sea is also a [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|UNESCO biosphere reserve]].\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Bretagne Finistere PointeduRaz15119.jpg|thumb|The [[Pointe du Raz]], one of the westernmost extents of both Brittany and Metropolitan France.]]\nThe Breton peninsula appeared during the [[Cadomian Orogeny]], which formed its northern coastline, between [[Guingamp]] and [[Foug\u00e8res]]. The southern part emerged during the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogeny]]. At the same time, an intense volcanic activity left large quantities of [[granite]]. Between the Cadomian and Hercynian periods, the region was submerged several times and the sea left [[fossil]]s and [[sedimentary rock]]s, mostly [[schist]] and [[sandstone]]. Because of the absence of [[limestone]], soils in Brittany are usually acid. \n\nThe [[Armorican massif]] straightened and flattened several times during the formation of the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]]. Changes in sea levels and climate led to a strong erosion and to the formation of more [[sedimentary rock]]s. [[Metamorphism]] is responsible for the distinctive local blue schist and for the rich subsoil of the [[Groix|Groix island]], which comprises [[glaucophane]] and [[epidote]].<ref name=\"geology\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bretagne-environnement.org/Sous-sol/Le-contexte-breton/Histoire-geologique|title=L'histoire g\u00e9ologique de la Bretagne|editor=Portail de l'information environnementale en Bretagne|author=Emmanu\u00e8le Savelli|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320132724/http://www.bretagne-environnement.org/Sous-sol/Le-contexte-breton/Histoire-geologique|archivedate=20 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Quaternary]] glaciations, Brittany was covered by [[loess]] and rivers started to fill the valleys with alluvial deposits. The valleys themselves were a result of a strong tectonic activity between the [[African plate|African]] and the [[Eurasian plate]]. The present Breton landscape did not acquired its final shape before one million years ago. The Breton subsoil is characterised by a huge amount of [[fracture (geology)|fractures]] that form a large [[aquifer]] containing several millions square meters of water.<ref name=\"geology\"/>\n\n===Climate===\nBrittany lies within the [[Temperateness|north temperate zone]]. It has a changeable, [[maritime climate]], similar to [[Cornwall]]. Rainfall occurs regularly but sunny, cloudless days are also common. In the summer months, temperatures in the region can reach {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, yet the climate remains comfortable, especially when compared to the French regions located south of the [[Loire River|Loire]]. The temperature difference between summer and winter is about fifteen degrees, but it varies depending on the proximity of the sea. The weather is generally milder on the seacoast than inland but rainfall occurs with the same intensity on both. The [[Monts d'Arr\u00e9e]], despite their low elevation, have much more rainfall than the rest of the region. The south coast, between [[Lorient]] and [[Pornic]], enjoys more than 2,000 hours of sunshine per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/index.php?s=&d=|title=Normales et records des stations m\u00e9t\u00e9o de France \u2013 Infoclimat|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n[[File:Poissonlune mole2.jpg|thumb|An [[ocean sunfish]] exhibiting its characteristic horizontal basking behaviour several miles off [[Penmarch]].]]\nBrittany's wildlife is typical of France with several distinctions. On one hand, the region, due to its long coastline, has a rich oceanic fauna, and some birds cannot be seen in other French regions. On the other hand, the species found in the inland are usually common for France, and because Brittany is a peninsula, the number of species is lower in its western extremity than in the eastern part.\n\nA variety of seabirds can be seen close to the seaside, which is home to colonies of [[Great cormorant|cormorants]], [[European herring gull|gulls]], [[razorbill]]s, [[northern gannet]]s, [[common murre]]s and [[Atlantic puffin]]s.

As in other French regions, formal education before the 19th century was the preserve of the elite. Before 1460, Brittany did not have a university, and Breton students had to go to [[Angers]], [[Poitiers]] or [[Caen]]. The [[University of Nantes]] was founded under the duke [[Francis II of Brittany|Francis II]], who wanted to affirm the Breton independence from France. All the traditional disciplines were taught here: arts, theology, law and medicine. During the 17th century, it had around 1,500 students. It declined during the 18th century, mostly because [[Nantes]] was flourishing with the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and paid no attention to its cultural institutions. \n\nA [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] eventually asked the university to be relocated to [[Rennes]], more devoted to culture and science, and the faculties progressively moved there after 1735.<ref name=\"ind\u00e9pendance\">''[http://www.espace-sciences.org/science/10065-sciences-ouest/20106-Annee-1993/10235-93/10880-gros-plan/16926-histoire/16927-la-lente-mise-en-place-des/index.html \u00abLa Lente Mise en Place des Universit\u00e9s Bretonnes\u00bb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319203017/http://www.espace-sciences.org/science/10065-sciences-ouest/20106-Annee-1993/10235-93/10880-gros-plan/16926-histoire/16927-la-lente-mise-en-place-des/index.html |date=19 March 2012 }}'', Science Ouest N\u00b093</ref> The transfer was interrupted by the [[French Revolution]], and all the French universities were dissolved in 1793.\n\n[[Napoleon]] reorganised the French education system in 1808.

A new [[University of Rennes]] was progressively recreated during the 19th century. In the meantime, several laws were promoted to open schools, notably for girls. In 1882, [[Jules Ferry]] succeeded in passing a law which made primary education in France free, non-clerical (la\u00efque) and mandatory. Thus, free schools were opened in almost every villages of Brittany. Jules Ferry also promoted education policies establishing French language as the language of the Republic, and mandatory education was a mean to eradicate regional languages and dialects. In Brittany, it was forbidden for the pupils to speak [[Breton language|Breton]] or [[Gallo language|Gallo]], and the two were strongly depreciated. Humiliating practices aimed at stamping out the Breton language and culture prevailed in state schools until the late 1960s.<ref>[http://www.breizh.net/icdbl/saozg/endangered.htm#Image%20No.%202:%20Breton%20is%20a%20hindrance%20to%20good%20citizenship ICBL information about Breton] at breizh.net</ref> In response, the [[Diwan (school)|Diwan schools]] were founded in 1977 to teach Breton by [[Language immersion|immersion]].

The number of exploitations tends to diminish, but as a result, they are merged into very large estates. Brittany is the first producer in France for vegetables ([[green bean]]s, onions, [[artichoke]]s, potatoes, tomatoes...). Cereals are mostly grown for cattle feeding. Wine, especially [[muscadet]], is made in a small region south of [[Nantes]]. Brittany is the first region in France for fishing.

Nonetheless, French was not widely known before the 19th century, and two [[regional language]]s exist in Brittany: [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Gallo language|Gallo]]. They are separated by a [[language border]] that has constantly moved back since the Middle Ages. \n\nThe current border runs from [[Plouha]] on the [[English Channel]] to the [[Rhuys Peninsula]] on the [[Bay of Biscay]]. Because of their origins and practice, Breton and Gallo can be compared to [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Scots language]] in Scotland{{Citation needed|reason=the Breton and Gallo pages linked to here suggest this sentence is incorrect|date=October 2019}}. Both have been recognised as \"Langues de Bretagne\" (languages of Brittany) by the [[Regional Council of Brittany]] since 2004.\n\n====Breton====\n{{main|Breton language}}\n[[File:Road signs bilingual Breton in Quimper.jpg|thumb|left|Bilingual road signs can be seen in traditional Breton-speaking areas.]]\nBreton is a [[Celtic language]] derived from the historical [[Common Brittonic]] language, and is most closely related to [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. It was imported to Western [[Armorica]] during the 5th century by Britons fleeing the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain]]. Since the 13th century, long before the [[union of Brittany and France]], the main administrative language of the Duchy of Brittany had been French, which had evolved from Latin. Breton remained the language of the rural population, but since the [[Middle Ages]] the [[bourgeoisie]], the [[nobility]], and the higher clergy have spoken French.\n\nGovernment policies in the 19th and 20th centuries made education compulsory and, at the same time, forbade the use of Breton in schools to push non-French speakers into adopting the French language. Nevertheless, until the 1960s Breton was spoken or understood by many of the inhabitants of western Brittany. During the 1970s, Breton schools were opened and the local authorities started to promote the language, which was on the brink of extinction because parents had stopped teaching it to their children.\n\nHaving declined from more than one million speakers around 1950 to about 200,000 in the first decade of the 21st century, of whom 61% are more than 60 years old, Breton is classified as \"severely endangered\" by the UNESCO [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]]. However, the number of children attending bilingual classes has risen 33% between 2006 and 2012 to 14,709.<ref name=\"Broudic2009\">[[Fa\u00f1ch Broudic]], 2009.

Most of them are very similar to each other, with only some phonetic and lexical differences. The three main dialects spoken in the western end of Brittany, the '''Cornouillais'', around [[Quimper]], the ''L\u00e9onard'', around [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on]], and the ''Tr\u00e9gorrois'', around [[Tr\u00e9guier]], are grouped into the ''KLT group'' (Kerne-Leon-Treger), in opposition to the ''Vannetais'', spoken around [[Vannes]], which is the most differentiated Breton dialect.\n\nAccording to a 1999 INSEE survey, 12% of the adults of Brittany speak Breton.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 2003|title=Langue bretonne et autres langues : pratique et transmission|url=https://www.epsilon.insee.fr/jspui/bitstream/1/11835/1/oc92_lan.pdf|journal=INSEE|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n====Gallo====\n{{main|Gallo language}}\n[[File:Parc\u00e9 - panneau D23.jpg|thumb|Signs in Gallo are very rare and the writing systems they use are unknown by most of the speakers.]]\nGallo is spoken on the eastern half of Brittany. It is not itself a Celtic language. Like French, it is also descended from Latin (and is classified in the [[Langues d'o\u00efl]] branch), but has some Celtic influences, particularly in its vocabulary, whereas French has influences from both Celtic ([[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]) and [[Frankish language|Frankish]] (the [[Germanic language]] which arrived after Latin in much of the rest of France).\n\nUnlike Breton, Gallo does not have a long promotion history and it is still often perceived as a poor rural dialect. Moreover, because of its linguistic relationship with Gallo, French imposed itself more easily as the main language in [[Upper Brittany]] than in Breton speaking areas. Gallo was simply felt to be an incorrect way of speaking French rather than a separate language. Gallo transmission from parents to children is extremely low and efforts to standardise and publish books in Gallo did not reverse the decline of the language and its lack of [[prestige dialect|prestige]].<ref name=\"rapport\"/>\n\nGallo is also threatened by the Breton [[language revival]], because Breton is gaining ground in territories that were not previously part of the main Breton-speaking area, and most of all because Breton appears as the national language of Brittany, thus leaving no place for Gallo.<ref name=\"rapport\"/>\n\nGallo had never been written before the 20th century, and several writing systems were created. They are however rarely known by the population and signs in Gallo are often unreadable, even for fluent speakers. In [[Loire-Atlantique]], where Gallo is not promoted at all by the local authorities, many people do not even know the word \"Gallo\" and have no idea that it has writing systems and publications.<ref name=\"rapport\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.prefics.org/credilif/travaux/RapportGallo1.pdf|title=Pratiques et repr\u00e9sentations de la langue et de la culture r\u00e9gionales en Haute Bretagne|author=Andr\u00e9 Le Coq & Philippe Blanchet|editor=Centre de Recherche sur la Diversit\u00e9Linguistique de la Francophonie|year=2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002225736/http://www.prefics.org/credilif/travaux/RapportGallo1.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Gallo community is estimated at between 28,300<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/insee_regions/bretagne/themes/octant/oc92/oc92art3.pdf|title=Langue bretonne et autres langues : pratique et transmission|editor=INSEE}}</ref> and 200,000<ref name=\"rapport\"/> speakers.

During the Briton emigration to Brittany, several Christian missionaries, mostly Welsh, came in the region and founded dioceses. They are known as the \"Seven founder saints\":\n* [[Paul Aurelian|Paol Aoreliann]], at [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on]],\n* [[Tudwal]], at [[Tr\u00e9guier]],\n* [[Brioc|Brieg]], at [[Saint-Brieuc]],\n* [[Malo (saint)|Malo\u00f9]], at [[Saint-Malo]],\n* [[Samson of Dol|Samsun of Dol]], at [[Dol-de-Bretagne]],\n* [[Padarn]], at [[Vannes]],\n* [[Corentin of Quimper|Kaourintin]], at [[Quimper, Finist\u00e8re|Quimper]].\n\nOther notable early missionaries are [[Gildas]] and the Irish saint [[Columbanus]]. In total, Brittany numbers more than 300 \"[[saint]]s\" (only a few recognised by the Catholic Church) and, since the 19th century at least, it has been known as one of the most devoutly Catholic regions in France, together with the neighbouring [[Pays de la Loire]] region. The proportion of students attending Catholic private schools is the highest in France. The [[patron saint]] of Brittany is [[Saint Anne]], the Virgin's mother, but [[Ivo of Kermartin]], a 13th-century priest, called Saint-Yves in French and Sant-Erwan in Breton, can also be considered as a patron saint. His feast, the 19 May, is Brittany's national day.\n\n[[File:FRANCE - Bretagne - Locronan - Chapelle.JPG|thumb|left|A chapel and a calvary in [[Locronan]], Finist\u00e8re.]]\nMany distinctive traditions and customs have also been preserved in Brittany. Among them, the \"[[Pardon (ceremony)|Pardon]]s\" are one of the most traditional demonstrations of popular Catholicism. These [[sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|penitential ceremonies]] occur in some villages in [[Lower Brittany]] on the [[feast day]] of the parish's saint. The penitents form a procession and they walk together to a [[shrine]], a church or any sacred place. Some Pardons are reputed for their length, and they all finish by large meals and popular feasts.\n\n[[File:002 Ploudiry ossuaire 2 ankou.JPG|thumb|A sculpted [[Ankou]] in [[Ploudiry]].]]\nThere is a very old [[pilgrimage]] called the ''[[Tro Breizh]]'' (tour of Brittany), where the pilgrims walk around Brittany from the grave of one of the seven founder saints to another. Historically, the pilgrimage was made in one trip (a total distance of around 600&nbsp;km) for all seven saints. Nowadays, however, pilgrims complete the circuit over the course of several years. In 2002, the Tro Breizh included a special pilgrimage to [[Wales]], symbolically making the reverse journey of the Welshmen Sant Paol, Sant Brieg, and Sant Samzun.<ref>''Bretagne: poems'' (in French), by Amand Gu\u00e9rin,\nPublished by P. Masgana, 1842: page 238</ref>\n\nThe most powerful folk figure is the [[Ankou]] or the \"Reaper of Death\". Sometimes a skeleton wrapped in a shroud with the Breton flat hat, sometimes described as a real human being (the last dead of the year, devoted to bring the dead to Death), he makes his journeys by night carrying an upturned scythe which he throws before him to reap his harvest. Sometimes he is on foot but mostly he travels with a cart, the ''Karrig an Ankou'', drawn by two oxen and a lean horse. Two servants dressed in the same shroud and hat as the Ankou pile the dead into the cart, and to hear it creaking at night means you have little time left to live.<ref>[[Anatole le Braz]], ''La Legende de la Mort'', BiblioBazaar reprint, LLC, 2009, pp. 430ff.</ref>\n\nAs official religious statistics are forbidden in France, there are no official figures about religious practices in Brittany. However, successive polls show that the region tends to be more and more [[irreligion|nonreligious]]. Catholic religion has started to decline after the [[Second World War]], during the urbanisation of Brittany. A poll conducted in 2006 showed that [[Morbihan]] was the only ''[[d\u00e9partement]]'' to have a strong Catholic population, around 70% of its inhabitants belonging to that religion. [[Loire-Atlantique]] and [[C\u00f4tes-d'Armor]] were among the least Catholic French ''d\u00e9partements'', with only 50% of Catholics, while [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] and [[Finist\u00e8re]] were at around 65%. Other religions are almost non-existent, apart from [[Islam]] which gathers between 1 and 3% of the inhabitants in [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] and [[Loire-Atlantique]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifop.com/media/poll/religions_geo.pdf|title=\u00c9l\u00e9ments d'analyse g\u00e9ographique de l'implantation des religions en France|editor=Ifop|date=December 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Fr Josselin Castle from river with flowers.JPG|thumb|[[Josselin Castle]].]]\nBrittany is home to many [[megalith]]ic monuments; the words ''[[menhir]]'' and ''[[dolmen]]'' come from the [[Breton language]]. The largest menhir alignments are the [[Carnac stones]]. Other major sites include the [[Barnenez]] [[cairn]], the [[Locmariaquer megaliths]], the [[Menhir de Champ-Dolent]], the [[Mane Braz]] [[tumulus]] and the [[Gavrinis]] tomb. Monuments from the [[Roman Gaul|Roman]] period are rare, but include a large temple in [[Corseul]] and scarce ruins of villas and city walls in [[Rennes]] and [[Nantes]].\n\nBrittany has a large number of medieval buildings. They include numerous [[Romanesque style|Romanesque]] and [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] churches, usually built in local [[sandstone]] and [[granite|granit]], castles and half-timbered houses visible in villages, towns and cities. Several Breton towns still have their medieval walls, such as [[Gu\u00e9rande]], [[Concarneau]], [[Saint-Malo]], [[Vannes]], [[Foug\u00e8res]] and [[Dinan]]. Major churches include [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on Cathedral]], [[Tr\u00e9guier Cathedral]], [[Dol Cathedral]], [[Nantes Cathedral]] and the [[Kreisker chapel]]. Most of the Breton castles were rebuilt between the 13th and the 15th century, such as the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Suscinio]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Dinan]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Combourg]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Largo\u00ebt]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Tonqu\u00e9dec]], the [[Josselin Castle]] and the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Tr\u00e9cesson]]. The most impressive castles can be seen along the border with France, where stand the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Foug\u00e8res]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vitr\u00e9]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2teaubriant]] and the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Clisson]].\n\n[[File:Cahire.JPG|thumb|left|A traditional house in [[Plougoumelen]].]]\nThe [[French Renaissance]] occurred when Brittany lost its independence. The Renaissance architecture is almost absent in the region, except in [[Upper Brittany]], close to the border with France. Major sites include the [[Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne]], the last permanent residence of the dukes, which displays the transition from late Gothic to Renaissance style. The [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2teaubriant]], a former fortress, was transformed into a vast palace in the Italian style.\n\n[[File:B\u00e9nodet - Le Minaret.jpg|thumb|An [[Art Deco]] villa in [[B\u00e9nodet]].]]\nIn [[Lower Brittany]], the medieval style never totally disappeared. However, local innovations permitted some changes and the birth of a particular style. Its most distinctive feature is the [[parish close]], which displays an elaborately decorated church surrounded by an entirely walled churchyard. Many villages still have their closes, they date from the 16th and 17th centuries and sometimes include an elaborately carved [[calvary (sculpture)|calvary sculpture]].\n\nDuring the 17th and the 18th centuries, the main [[seaport]]s and towns obtained a typical French look, with [[baroque]] and [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] buildings. [[Nantes]], which was at the time the biggest French harbour, received a theatre, large avenues and quays, and [[Rennes]] was redesigned after a fire in 1720. At the same period, the wealthy [[ship-owner]]s from [[Saint-Malo]] built many mansions called \"Malouini\u00e8res\" around their town. Along the coast, [[Vauban]] and other French architects designed several citadels, such as in [[Le Palais]] and [[Port-Louis, Morbihan|Port-Louis]]. In rural areas, Breton houses remained simple, with a single floor and a [[longhouse]] pattern. They were built with local materials: mostly granite in [[Lower Brittany]] and [[schist]] in [[Upper Brittany]]. [[Slate]]s and [[thatching|reeds]] were usually used for roofing. During the 19th century, the Breton architecture was mainly characterised by the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] and [[Eclecticism]]. [[Clisson]], the southernmost Breton town, was rebuilt in an Italian [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style around 1820. The Breton [[lighthouse]]s were mostly built during the 19th century. The most famous are [[Ar Men]], [[Phare d'Eckm\u00fchl]], [[La Vieille]] and [[La Jument]]. The lighthouse on the [[\u00cele Vierge]] is, with 77 meters, the highest in Europe.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, several [[seaside resort]]s were created along the coast and villas and hotels were built in [[historicism (art)|historicist]], [[Art Nouveau]], and later in the [[Art Deco]] styles. These architectures are particularly present in [[Dinard]], [[La Baule]] and [[B\u00e9nodet]]. Architecture from the 20th century can be seen in [[Saint-Nazaire]], [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Lorient]], three cities destroyed during the [[Second World War]] and rebuilt afterwards, and in the works of the Breton nationalist architects like [[James Bouill\u00e9]] and [[Olier Mordrel]].\n\n===Fine arts===\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 078.jpg|thumb|''The Beautiful Ang\u00e8le'' by [[Paul Gauguin]].]]\nUntil the 19th century, [[Catholicism]] had been the main inspiration for Breton artists. The region has a great number of [[baroque]] [[retable]]s, made between the 17th and the 19th century. Breton sculptors were also famous for their ship models that served as [[ex-voto]]s and for their richly decorated furniture, which features na\u00efve Breton characters and traditional patterns. The [[box-bed]] is the most famous Breton piece of furniture. The Breton style had a strong revival between 1900 and the [[Second World War]] and it was used by the [[Seiz Breur]] movement. The Seiz Breur artists also tried to invent a modern Breton art by rejecting French standards and mixing traditional techniques with new materials. The leading artists of that period were the designer [[Ren\u00e9-Yves Creston]], the illustrators [[Jeanne Malivel]] and [[Xavier Haas]], and the sculptors [[Raffig Tullou]], [[Francis Renaud (sculptor)|Francis Renaud]], [[Georges Robin]], [[Joseph Savina]], [[Jules-Charles Le Bozec]] and [[Jean Fr\u00e9our]].\n\nBrittany is also known for its [[needlework]], which can be seen on its numerous headdress models, and for its [[faience]] production, which started at the beginning of the 18th century. [[Quimper faience]] is known worldwide for its bowls and plates painted by hand, and other towns, such as [[Pornic]], also maintain a similar tradition. The potteries usually feature na\u00efve Breton characters in traditional clothing and daily scenes. The designs have a strong traditional Breton influence, but [[Orientalism]] and [[Art Deco]] have also been used.\n\nBecause of its distinct culture and natural landscape, Brittany has inspired many French artists since the 19th century. The [[Pont-Aven School]], which started to emerge in the 1850s and lasted until the beginning of the 20th century, had a decisive influence on modern painting. The artists who settled in [[Pont-Aven]] wanted to break away from the [[Academic art|Academic style]] of the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] and later from [[Impressionism]] when it began to decline. Among them were [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Paul Signac]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Paul S\u00e9rusier]] and [[Raymond Wintz]]. Before them, Brittany had also been visited by Academic and Romantic painters like [[Jean Antoine Th\u00e9odore de Gudin]] and [[Jules Achille No\u00ebl]] who were looking for dramatic seascapes and storms.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Brittany|Breton dance}}\n[[File:Bagad.JPG|thumb|The [[Lann-Bihou\u00e9]] [[bagad]].]]\nSince the early 1970s, Brittany has experienced a tremendous revival of its folk music. Numerous festivals were created, along with smaller ''[[fest noz|fest-noz]]'' (popular feasts). The ''[[bagad]]o\u00f9'', bands composed of [[bagpipe]]s, [[bombard (music)|bombards]] and drums (including [[Snare drum|snare]]), are also a modern creation, inspired by the Scottish [[pipe band]]s. The [[Lann-Bihou\u00e9]] bagad, one of the most well-known, belongs to the [[French Navy]]. It is the only one that does not take part to the annual bagado\u00f9 competitions. [[Celtic harp]] is also common, as are vocals and dances. The [[Kan ha diskan]] is the most common type of singing. The performers sing calls and responses while dancing. Breton dances usually imply circles, chains or couples and they are different in every region. The oldest dances seem to be the [[passepied]] and the [[gavotte]], and the newest ones derive from the [[quadrille]] and [[French Renaissance]] dances.\n\n[[File:Nolwenn Leroy - Alan Stivell.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nolwenn Leroy]] and [[Alan Stivell]] (2012).]]\nIn the 1960s, several Breton artists started to use contemporary patterns to create a Breton pop music. Among them, [[Alan Stivell]] highly contributed to popularise the [[Celtic harp]] and Breton music in the world. He also used [[American rock|American]] [[rock and roll]] in his works and influenced 1970s Breton bands such as [[Kornog]], [[Gwerz]] and [[Tri Yann]], who revived traditional songs and made them popular across France. [[Soldat Louis]] is the main Breton rock band,{{fact|date=March 2019}} and Breton singers include [[Gilles Servat]], [[Glenmor]], [[Dan Ar Braz]], [[Yann-Fa\u00f1ch Kemener]], [[Denez Prigent]], [[Nolwenn Korbell]] and [[Nolwenn Leroy]]. The [[Manau (group)|Manau]] [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] group from Paris has strong Breton and Celtic inspirations.\n\n[[Yann Tiersen]], who composed the soundtrack for ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'', the [[Electro (music)|Electro]] band [[Yelle]] and the [[avant-garde]] singer [[Brigitte Fontaine]] are also from Brittany. The 19th-century composer [[Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray]] was one of the first western European composers to be influenced by what is now known as [[world music]].\n\n===Legends and literature===\n[[File:Botrel.jpg|thumb|The singer-songwriter [[Th\u00e9odore Botrel]] dressed in traditional Breton costume.]]\nBrittany is closely associated with the [[Matter of Britain]] and [[King Arthur]]. According to [[Wace]], [[Broc\u00e9liande]] is located in Brittany and it is nowadays considered to be [[Paimpont forest]]. There, ruins of a castle surrounded by a lake are associated with the [[Lady of the Lake]], a [[dolmen]] is said to be [[Merlin]]'s tomb and a path is presented as [[Morgan le Fay]]'s [[Val sans Retour]]. [[Tristan and Iseult]] are also said to have lived in Brittany. Another major Breton legend is the story about [[Ys]], a city swallowed by the ocean.\n\nBreton literature before the 19th century was mostly oral.  The oral tradition entertained by medieval poets died out during the 15th century and books in [[Breton language|Breton]] were very rare before 1850. At that time, local writers started to collect and publish local tales and legends and wrote original works.  Published between 1925 and the [[Second World War]], the literary journal [[Gwalarn]] favoured a modern Breton literature and helped translating widely known novels into Breton.  After the war, the journal ''Al Liamm'' pursued that mission. Among the authors writing in Breton are [[Auguste Brizeux]], a Romantic poet, the [[neo-Druid]]ic bard [[Erwan Berthou]], [[Th\u00e9odore Claude Henri, vicomte Hersart de la Villemarqu\u00e9|Th\u00e9odore Hersart de La Villemarqu\u00e9]], who collected the local legends about [[King Arthur]], [[Roparz Hemon]], founder of [[Gwalarn]], [[P\u00ear-Jakez Helias]], [[Glenmor]], [[P\u00ear Denez]] and [[Meavenn]].\n\nBreton literature in French includes 19th-century historical novels by [[\u00c9mile Souvestre]], travel journals by [[Anatole Le Braz]], poems and novels by [[Charles Le Goffic]], the works of the singer-songwriter [[Th\u00e9odore Botrel]] and of the maritime writer [[Henri Queff\u00e9lec]]. Brittany is also the birthplace of many French writers like [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Ernest Renan]], [[F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Robert de Lamennais]] and [[Pierre Ab\u00e9lard]] [[Max Jacob]], [[Alfred Jarry]], [[Victor Segalen]], [[Xavier Grall]], [[Jean Rouaud]], [[Ir\u00e8ne Frain]], [[Herve Jaouen]]<ref>Herv\u00e9_Jaouen</ref>, [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]], [[Pierre-Jakez H\u00e9lias]], [[Tristan Corbi\u00e8re]], [[Paul F\u00e9val]], [[Jean Gu\u00e9henno]], [[Arthur Bern\u00e8de]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Patrick Poivre d'Arvor]]\n\nThe ''[[Asterix]]'' comics, set during the time of [[Julius Caesar]] and written in the second half of the twentieth century, are set in Armorica, now Brittany.\n\n===Museums===\nThe Museum of Brittany, located in [[Rennes]], was founded in 1856. Its collections are mainly dedicated to the history of the region. Museums dedicated to [[Prehistory]] and local [[megalith]]s are located in [[Carnac]] and [[Penmarch]], while several towns like [[Vannes]] and [[Nantes]] have a museum presenting their own history.\n\nThe [[Museum of Fine Arts of Rennes]] owns a large collection of Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities as well as drawings and engravings by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] and [[Rembrandt]]. Its French art collection gathers works by [[Georges de La Tour]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Camille Corot]] and [[Robert Delaunay]]. It has also works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Rubens]], [[Peter Lely]] and [[Paolo Veronese]]. The collections of the [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nantes|Museum of Fine Arts of Nantes]] are more dedicated to modern and contemporary art and contain works by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Paul Signac]], [[Tamara de Lempicka]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Pierre Soulages]] and [[Piero Manzoni]]. The Museums of Fine Arts of [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Quimper]] offer similar collections, with large quantities of French painting together with the works of some Italian and Dutch artists. The Museum of Fine Arts [[Pont-Aven]] is dedicated to the [[School of Pont-Aven]]. Contemporary sculptures can be seen in the park around the Ch\u00e2teau de Kergu\u00e9hennec, in [[Bignan]].\n\nMuseums in [[Saint-Malo]], [[Lorient]] and [[Douarnenez]] are dedicated to ships and maritime traditions and history. The [[Mus\u00e9e national de la Marine]] has a large annex in Brest and a submarine is opened to visitors in [[Lorient]]. In the same town, it is also possible to visit the [[Keroman Submarine Base]] built in 1942, and the ''Cit\u00e9 de la voile [[\u00c9ric Tabarly]]'', a museum dedicated to sailing. In [[Saint-Nazaire]], where many [[Ocean liner|transatlantic ships]] where built, including ''[[SS Normandie]]'' and ''[[SS France (1961)|SS France]]'', a museum showing transatlantic interiors was installed in a [[Second World War]] base. Nantes has a [[Jules Verne Museum|museum dedicated to Jules Verne]], a [[Natural History Museum of Nantes|Natural History Museum]] and a museum of archaeology and design, the [[Mus\u00e9e Dobr\u00e9e]].\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:Tonnerres de Brest 2012 - G\u00f6theborg - 003.jpg|thumb|The ''[[G\u00f6theborg (ship)|G\u00f6theborg]]'' ship replica at the Brest tall ship meeting in 2012.]]\nBrittany has a vibrant calendar of festivals and events. It hosts some of France's biggest contemporary music festivals, such as [[La Route du Rock]] in [[Saint-Malo]], the [[Vieilles Charrues Festival|Vieilles Charrues]] in [[Carhaix]], the [[Rencontres Trans Musicales]] in [[Rennes]], the Festival du Bout du Monde in [[Crozon]], the [[Hellfest (French music festival)|Hellfest]] in [[Clisson]] and the Astropolis in Brest. The [[Festival Interceltique de Lorient]] welcomes each year participants all the [[Celtic nations]] and their diasporas. [[La Folle Journ\u00e9e]], in [[Nantes]], is the largest classical music festival in France.\n\nThe Breton culture is highlighted during the ''F\u00eate de la Bretagne'', which occurs in many places around Saint-Yves's day (19 May), and during the Festival de Cornouaille in [[Quimper]]. Several towns also organise [[historical re-enactment]]s and events celebrating local traditions, such as the Filets Bleus in [[Concarneau]] which celebrates fishing.\n\nBrittany also has some film festivals like the [[Three Continents Festival]] in [[Nantes]]. The [[Utopiales]] international science fiction festival is held in the same city. Brest and [[Douarnenez]] both organise large [[tall ship]] meetings.\n\n===Sport===\n[[Association football|Football]], cycling and sailing are the three most popular sports in Brittany. Major football teams are the [[FC Nantes]], the [[Stade Rennais F.C.]], the [[FC Lorient]], the [[Stade Brestois 29]], the [[Vannes OC]] and the [[En Avant de Guingamp]]. Professional footballers coming from the region also form the [[Brittany national football team]] which sometimes plays with national teams.\n\nSeveral Bretons have won the [[Tour de France]]: [[Bernard Hinault]], [[Louison Bobet]], [[Jean Robic]] and [[Lucien Petit-Breton]] as riders, and [[Cyrille Guimard]] as a ''[[directeur sportif]]''.\n\nSailing is particularly important for sea-resorts like [[La Trinit\u00e9-sur-Mer]], [[Pornichet]], [[Concarneau]], [[Lorient]] and the [[\u00eeles de Gl\u00e9nan]], where a prestigious school is located. A great number of Bretons have become acclaimed sailors, such as: [[\u00c9ric Tabarly]], [[Lo\u00efck Peyron]], [[Jean Le Cam]], [[Michel Desjoyeaux]], [[Olivier de Kersauson]], [[Thomas Coville]], [[Vincent Riou]] and [[Marc Pajot]]. The [[Route du Rhum]], the [[Transat Qu\u00e9bec-Saint-Malo]], the [[Jules Verne Trophy]] are the main Breton sailing competitions. The [[Solitaire du Figaro]] stages often start in Brittany.\n\n[[Gouren]], a style of [[folk wrestling]], is the most popular Breton sport. The [[Boule bretonne]] is related to [[p\u00e9tanque]]. The ''Palets'', common in [[Upper Brittany]] and in other French regions, is also related to p\u00e9tanque, but players use iron disks instead of balls and they have to throw them on a wooden board.\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Galette \u0153uf saucisse.JPG|thumb|[[Galette]]s served with eggs and sausages.]]\nAlthough [[Muscadet]] and Gros Plant white wines are produced south of the [[Loire River|Loire]], the traditional drink of Brittany is [[cider]]. Brittany is the second-largest cider-producing region in France.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaoueg.bzh/le-cidre |title=Le Cidre&nbsp;\u2013 Mediaoueg , Ar Vediaoueg&nbsp;\u2013 La M\u00e9diath\u00e8que |publisher=Mediaoueg.bzh |date= |accessdate=3 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910212009/http://www.mediaoueg.bzh/le-cidre/ |archive-date=10 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Breton cider is traditionally served in a bowl or a cup. Brittany also has a long beer-brewing tradition, tracing its roots back to the 17th century. Young artisanal brewers are keeping a variety of beer types alive,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bierbreizh.info/ |title=bierbreizh&nbsp;\u2013 Accueil |publisher=Bierbreizh.info |date= |accessdate=3 May 2011}}</ref> such as ''Coreff de Morlaix'', ''Tri Martolod'' and ''Britt''. Stronger alcohols include the ''[[chouchen]]'', a sort of [[mead]] made with wild honey, and an apple [[eau de vie]] called ''lambig''.\n\n[[Cr\u00eape]]s and [[galette]]s are the two most well-known Breton dishes. The cr\u00eapes, made and served with butter, are eaten for dessert and the galettes are usually salty and made with [[buckwheat]]. They traditionally replaced bread as basic food and they can be served with cheese, sausages, bacon, mushrooms or eggs. They can be accompanied by Breton [[buttermilk]] called ''lait ribot''. Brittany also has a dish similar to the [[pot-au-feu]] known as the [[kig ha farz]], which consists of stewed pork or beef with [[buckwheat]] dumplings.\n\nSurrounded by the sea, Brittany offers a wide range of fresh seafood and fish, especially [[mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s. Among the seafood specialities is a fish stew called [[cotriade]]. The [[beurre blanc]] sauce, invented in [[Saint-Julien-de-Concelles]], close to [[Nantes]], is often served with fish. Brittany is also known for its salt, mainly harvested around [[Gu\u00e9rande]] and used in butter and milk caramels. The region is notable for its biscuit factories, many towns having their own: [[Quimper]], [[Lorient]], [[Pont-Aven]], [[Saint-Brieuc]], BN and [[Lef\u00e8vre-Utile|LU]] in [[Nantes]], La Trinitaine in [[La Trinit\u00e9-sur-Mer]], and Galettes Saint-Michel in [[Saint-Michel-Chef-Chef]]. They usually make their biscuits with salted butter and sell them in iron boxes. Famous Breton [[pastry|pastries]] include the ''[[kouign amann]]'' (\"butter cake\" in Breton) made with bread dough and high quantities of butter and sugar, and the  ''[[far Breton|far]]'', a sort of sweet [[Yorkshire pudding]] usually made with plums.\n\n==Transport==\n\n=== Road ===\n[[File:Borne N786.jpg|thumb|An old road sign on the Route Nationale 786 in [[Tr\u00e9veneuc]].]]\nUntil the 1970s, the Breton road network was poor because maritime and rail transport prevailed. The French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] implemented a major road construction plan in the 1970 and Brittany received over 10&nbsp;billion [[French francs|francs]] of investments during 25 years.<ref>[http://www.espace-sciences.org/science/10065-sciences-ouest/20109-Annee-1996/10195-125/10680-gros-plan/12801-histoire-et-societe/12803-le-plan-routier-breton/index.html Plan routier Breton (2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105230921/http://www.espace-sciences.org/science/10065-sciences-ouest/20109-Annee-1996/10195-125/10680-gros-plan/12801-histoire-et-societe/12803-le-plan-routier-breton/index.html |date=5 November 2013 }}</ref> More than 10,000&nbsp;km of [[controlled-access highway|motorways]] were built, permitting Breton road transport to multiply by four.

It also provides a link to southern [[Normandy]], terminating in Paris. In south Brittany the [[Route nationale 165]] performs a similar role along the south coast providing connections between [[Nantes]], [[Vannes]], [[Lorient]], [[Quimper]] and [[Brest, France|Brest]]. The Route nationale 164 crosses the centre of the peninsula and connects [[Rennes]] to [[Loud\u00e9ac]], [[Morlaix]] and [[Ch\u00e2teaulin]], and the Route nationale 166 links [[Rennes]] to [[Vannes]]. The Route nationale 137 provides connections between [[Saint-Malo]], [[Rennes]] and [[Nantes]] and terminates in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n[[Nantes]] is linked to Paris by the [[A11 autoroute]], and [[Rennes]] is both on the [[A81 autoroute]] to Paris and the [[A84 autoroute]] to [[Caen]]. These highways are standard French [[toll road]].\n\n=== Air ===\n[[File:Morlaix-Viaduc-1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Morlaix]] railway viaduct is one of the highest in France.]]\nThe biggest Breton airport is [[Nantes Atlantique Airport]]. Destination served include the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Morocco. It will be replaced around 2017 by the new [[A\u00e9roport du Grand Ouest]], located 30&nbsp;km to the north-west of Nantes. The [[Brest Bretagne Airport]] is the second airport in Brittany. It is followed by [[Rennes - Saint-Jacques Airport|Rennes \u2013 Saint-Jacques]], [[Lorient South Brittany Airport|Lorient South Brittany]] and [[Dinard - Pleurtuit - Saint-Malo Airport|Dinard \u2013 Saint-Malo]]. The [[Saint-Brieuc - Armor Airport|Saint-Brieuc \u2013 Armor]] airport serves flights between Brittany and the [[Channel Islands]]. Others smaller airport operates domestic flights in [[Quimper - Cornouaille Airport|Quimper]], and [[Lannion - C\u00f4te de Granit Airport|Lannion]].\n\n=== Rail ===\n[[File:Ms Bretagne.jpg|thumb|The [[Brittany Ferries]] ''MS Bretagne'' off Saint-Malo.]]\nBrittany is on two major [[TGV]] lines, one linking Paris to [[Nantes]] and [[Le Croisic]], on the south coast, and another linking Paris to [[Rennes]] and [[Brest, France|Brest]]. The [[LGV Atlantique]] which stops at Le Mans will be extended to Rennes in 2017, providing faster connections between Paris and Brittany. TGV train services also link the region with cities such as [[Lyon]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Marseille]], and [[Lille]]. Secondary train services are operated by [[TER Bretagne]] which provides connections between small towns such as [[Vannes]], [[Carhaix]], [[Roscoff]] and [[Paimpol]]. TER Bretagne also manages coach lines and connections between Rennes and Nantes. [[TER Pays de la Loire]] operates trains between Nantes and smaller towns in [[Loire-Atlantique]].\n\n=== Sea ===\nThere are ferry services that take passengers, vehicles and freight to Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands. The main companies are [[Brittany Ferries]] which operates lines between [[Plymouth]] and [[Roscoff]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Saint-Malo]], and [[Roscoff]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. [[Irish Ferries]] operates the route [[Rosslare Europort|Rosslare]]-[[Roscoff]] and [[Condor Ferries]] link [[Saint-Malo]] with [[Jersey]].\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling has always been one of the main sports of Brittany, but leisure cycling and the infrastructure to support it have been growing extremely rapidly. An extensive network of cycle paths and recommended cycle routes has opened up all over the region. Some of these are routes using mainly smaller roads and both signposted and maintained by communes individually, but many are based on dedicated cycle paths often formed by converting disused railway tracks. These help form routes such as 'V\u00e9lodyss\u00e9e' from Roscoff to Nantes and several major routes under the 'V' label (following signs V1, V2 etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://velo.tourismebretagne.com/|title=La Bretagne \u00e0 v\u00e9lo : Pr\u00e8s de 1500 km d\u2019itin\u00e9raires v\u00e9los !|website=velo.tourismebretagne.com|accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref> The old tow-path of the Nantes-Brest canal is now open to cyclists along its entire 385&nbsp;km length though in places (unlike rail-based cycle paths) it is very meandering and leaving the path will both shorten the distance and provide variety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bretonbikes.com/cycling-holidays-FAQ.html#canal|title=Cycling holidays in france FAQ page for all your questions|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a general rule cyclists are very well respected in the region and many larger towns have cycle-lanes \u2013 however traffic is 'cycle-friendly' even in their absence.\n\n== Symbols ==\n[[File:Drapeau Bretagne.jpg|thumb|The modern flag of Brittany.]]\nThe modern [[flag of Brittany]] was designed in 1923. It is called ''Gwenn ha Du'' (\"white and black\" in [[Breton language|Breton]]) and it features eleven [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] spots (their number may vary) and nine stripes, the black ones represent the Breton speaking historical dioceses, and the white ones symbolise the [[gallo language|gallo]] speaking dioceses. The flag was created to replace the traditional ermine plain standard, considered too aristocratic and royalist. It was inspired by the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] and the British [[Red Ensign]].<ref>[[Francis Favereau]], ''Bretagne contemporaine \u2013 Culture, langue, identit\u00e9''? page 210, Skol Vreizh, Morlaix, 2005, {{ISBN|2-911447-72-7}}.</ref> Since the 1920s, the flag has become very popular and it is flown from a large number of institutions. Apart from the ermine flag, Breton historic banners include the [[Kroaz Du]], a white flag with a black cross, the perfect negative of the [[St Piran's Flag|Cornish flag]].\n\n[[File:Hermine passante collet\u00e9e.svg|left|thumb|The ermine was the [[heraldic badge|badge]] of several dukes of Brittany.]]\nThe coat of arms of Brittany, ''ermine plain'', was adopted by [[John III, Duke of Brittany|John III]] in 1316. Ermine had been used in Brittany long before, and there is no clue about its origin. It was probably chosen by the dukes because of its similarity with the French [[fleur-de-lis]]. The [[ermine]], or stoat, as an animal became the [[heraldic badge|badge]] of [[John IV, Duke of Brittany|John IV]] at the end of the 14th century. It appeared later on numerous locations, including churches and castles. According to popular traditions, [[Anne of Brittany]] was hunting with her court when she saw a white ermine who preferred to die than to cross a dirty marsh. This episode would have inspired the duchess' motto : ''\"Potius mori quam foedari\"'' (\"rather death than dishonour\").<ref>Gwenc'hlan Le Scou\u00ebzec, ''Guide de la Bretagne'', page 40, Coop Breizh, Sp\u00e9zet, 1987; and ''Le Journal de la Bretagne des origines \u00e0 nos jours'', page 106, Larousse, Paris, 2001</ref> The motto has later been reused by Breton regiments, local [[Resistance during World War II|World War II Resistants]] and cultural movements.\n\nThe Breton anthem, although not official, is ''[[Bro Gozh ma Zado\u00f9]]'' \u2013 (\"Old Land of My Fathers\"). It re-employs both the [[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau|Welsh anthem]]'s music and that of \"Bro Goth agan Tasow\" (the national anthem of Cornwall; its lyrics were written at the end of the 19th century).\n\nColloquial Breton emblems include the Celtic [[triskelion]], the [[menhir]]s and [[dolmen]]s, local dishes such as the [[galette]]s, the [[Bigouden]] headdress and the traditional black round hat, the fisherman and his yellow raincoat, etc. ''BZH'' is a common abbreviation for \"Breizh\" (\"Brittany\" in Breton) and people often put BZH stickers on their car-plates, although it is forbidden under French laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&dateJO=19670707&numTexte=&pageDebut=06810&pageFin=|title=Fac-simil\u00e9 JO du 07/07/1967, page 06810 \u2013 Legifrance|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> ''[[.bzh]]'' is an approved Internet [[top level domain]] for the [[Breton people|Breton]] culture and languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domainesinfo.fr/english/136/brittany-s-bzh-the-next-regional-domain.php|title=The domain www.domainesinfo.fr is registered by NetNames|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings|title=Delegated Strings \u2013 ICANN New gTLDs|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"\" widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Tombeau Merlin Broc\u00e9liande195.JPG|[[Merlin]]'s tomb in the [[Broc\u00e9liande]] forest, [[Paimpont forest|Paimpont]]\nFile:Crucuno dolmen.jpg|A dolmen in [[Plouharnel]]\nFile:Guerande Tor.jpg|The city wall of [[Gu\u00e9rande]]\nFile:Tour-qui-qu-en-grogne-DS62.jpg|Castle of [[Saint-Malo]], ''Qui Qu'en Grogne'' Tower\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau Suscinio.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Suscinio]]\nFile:Phare IleVerge PM.jpg|[[\u00cele Vierge]] lighthouse\nFile:Parlement de Bretagne-2006.jpg|Parlement of Brittany in [[Rennes]]\nFile:Abbacy and lighthouse of Saint-Mathieu.jpg|Abbey and lighthouse of [[Pointe Saint-Mathieu|Saint-Mathieu]]\nFile:20 Moulin vert.JPG|''Ar Meilho\u00f9 Glaz'', a [[Bagad]] from [[Quimper]]\nFile:PLcdm 2009 S 028.JPG|''Festival du chant de marin'', sea songs festival in [[Paimpol]]\nFile:Batz-sur-Mer Coiffe.jpg|A Breton headdress from [[Batz-sur-Mer]]\nFile:W.

This word had been used by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] since the 1st century to refer to Great Britain, and more specifically the [[Roman Britain|Roman province of Britain]]. This word derives from a [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word, \u03a0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 (Prettanike) or \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 (Brettaniai), used by [[Pytheas]], an explorer from [[Marseille|Massalia]] who visited the [[British Islands]] around 320 BC. The Greek word itself comes from the common Brythonic ethnonym reconstructed as ''*Pritan\u012b'', itself from Proto-Celtic ''*k\u02b7ritanoi'' (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/k\u02b7er-|''*k\u02b7er-'']] 'to cut, make').\n\nThe Romans called Brittany ''[[Armorica]]''. It was a quite indefinite region that extended along the [[English Channel]] coast from the [[Seine]] estuary, then along the Atlantic coast to the [[Loire]] estuary and, according to several sources, maybe to the [[Garonne]] estuary. This term probably comes from a [[Gallic language|Gallic]] word, ''aremorica'', which means \"close to the sea\".<ref>{{Cite book|author=Pierre-Yves Lambert|title=La Langue Gauloise|year=1997|page=34}}</ref> Another name, ''Letauia'' (in English \"[[Litavis]]\"), was used until the 12th century. It possibly means \"wide and flat\" or \"to expand\" and it gave the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for Brittany: ''Llydaw''.<ref>{{Cite book|author=L\u00e9on Fleuriot|title=Les Origines de la Bretagne|publisher=Payot|year=1980|pages=53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], many [[Britons]] settled in western Armorica, and the region started to be called ''Britannia'', although this name only replaced ''Armorica'' in the sixth century or perhaps by the end of the fifth.<ref>{{Cite book|author=L\u00e9on Fleuriot|title=Les Origines de la Bretagne|pages=52\u201353|publisher=Payot|year= 1980}}</ref> Later, authors like [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] used the terms ''Britannia minor'' and ''Britannia major'' to distinguish Brittany from Britain.\n\nBreton-speaking people may pronounce the word ''Breizh'' in two different ways, according to their region of origin. Breton can be divided into two main dialects: the ''KLT'' ([[Cornouaille|Kerne]]-Leon-[[Tr\u00e9gor|Tregor]]) and the dialect of [[Vannes]]. KLT speakers pronounce it {{IPA-br|br\u025bjs|}} and would write it ''Breiz'', while the Vannetais speakers pronounce it {{IPA-br|br\u025b\u03c7|}} and would write it ''Breih''. The official spelling is a compromise between both variants, with a ''z'' and an ''h'' together. In 1941, efforts to unify the dialects led to the creation of the so-called ''Breton zh'', a standard which has never been widely accepted.<ref name=\"Walter\"/> On its side, [[Gallo language]] has never had a widely accepted writing system and several ones coexist. For instance, the name of the region in that language can be written ''Berta\u00e8yn'' in ''ELG'' script, or ''Bert\u00e8gn'' in ''MOGA'', and a couple of other scripts also exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://7seizh.info/2013/04/23/bertaeyn-galeizz-change-de-nom-un-evenement-pas-si-anodin/|title=Berta\u00e8yn Galeizz change de nom.

After the [[last glacial period]], the warmer climate allowed the area to become heavily wooded. At that time, Brittany was populated by relatively large communities who started to change their lifestyles from a life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers. Agriculture was introduced during the [[5th millennium BC]] by migrants from the south and east.

Several tribes also belonged to an \"Armorican [[confederation]]\" which, according to [[Julius Caesar]], gathered the [[Curiosolitae]], the [[Redones]], the [[Osismii]], the [[Unelli]], the [[Caletes]], the [[Lemovices]] and the Ambibarii.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Commentarii de Bello Gallico|author=Julius Caesar|page=75|work=VII}}</ref> The last four peoples mentioned by Caesar were respectively located in [[Cotentin]] (Lower-Normandy), [[pays de Caux]] (Upper-Normandy), [[Limousin]] (Aquitany) and the location of the Ambibarii is unknown. The Caletes are sometimes also considered as Belgians and \u2033Lemovices\u2033 is probably a mistake for \u2033[[Lexovii]]\u2033 (Lower-Normandy).\n\n===Gallo-Roman era===\n[[File:Corseul - Temple de Mars 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The temple of Mars in [[Corseul]].]]\nThe region became part of the [[Roman Republic]] in 51 BC. It was included in the province of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]] in 13 BC. Gallic towns and villages were redeveloped according to Roman standards, and several cities were created. These cities are Condate ([[Rennes]]), Vorgium ([[Carhaix]]), Darioritum ([[Vannes]]) and Condevincum or Condevicnum ([[Nantes]]). Together with Fanum Martis ([[Corseul]]), they were the capitals of the local [[civitas|civitates]]. They all had a [[grid plan]] and a [[forum (Roman)|forum]], and sometimes a temple, a [[basilica]], [[thermae]] or an [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]], like [[Carhaix]]. \n\nThe Romans also built three major roads through the region. However, most of the population remained rural. The free peasants lived in small huts, whereas the landowners and their employees lived in proper [[villa rustica|villae rusticae]]. The Gallic deities continued to be worshiped, and were often assimilated to the Roman gods. Only a small number of statues depicting Roman gods were found in Brittany, and most of the time they combine Celtic elements.<ref name=\"roman\">{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ac-rennes.fr/cst/doc/dossiers/archeo/archeo/classique.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040531074132/http://www2.ac-rennes.fr/cst/doc/Dossiers/archeo/archeo/classique.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=31 May 2004|title=Arch\u00e9ologie classique|editor=Universit\u00e9 de Rennes II|accessdate=26 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 3rd century AD, the region was attacked several times by [[Franks]], [[Alamanni]] and pirates. At the same time, the local economy collapsed and many farming estates were abandoned. To face the invasions, many towns and cities were fortified, like [[Nantes]], [[Rennes]] and [[Vannes]].<ref name=\"roman\"/>\n\n[[File:France Pays bretons map.svg|left|upright=1.35|thumb|A [[French language|French]] map of the traditional regions of Brittany in [[Kingdom of France|Ancien R\u00e9gime France]]. The earlier state of [[Domnonia]] or [[Domnon\u00e9e]] that united Brittany comprised the counties along the north coast.]]\n\n===Immigration of Britons===\nToward the end of the 4th century, the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] of what is now Wales and the [[South West Peninsula|South-Western peninsula of Great Britain]] began to emigrate to [[Armorica]]. The history behind such an establishment is unclear, but medieval Breton, Angevin and Welsh sources connect it to a figure known as [[Conan Meriadoc]]. Welsh literary sources assert that Conan came to Armorica on the orders of the Roman usurper [[Magnus Maximus]],{{efn| Magnus Maximus was a native of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in [[Spain]], being born on the estate of [[Count Theodosius]].}} who sent some of his British troops to Gaul to enforce his claims and settled them in Armorica. This account was supported by the Counts of Anjou, who claimed descent from a Roman soldier{{efn|Presumably this soldier was in the employ of [[Gratian]].}} expelled from Lower Brittany by Conan on Magnus's orders. Regardless of the truth of this story, Brythonic (British Celtic) settlement probably increased during the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain]] in the 5th and 6th centuries. \n\nScholars such as [[L\u00e9on Fleuriot]] have suggested a two-wave model of migration from Britain which saw the emergence of an independent Breton people and established the dominance of the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Breton language]] in Armorica.<ref>[[L\u00e9on Fleuriot]], ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l\u2019\u00e9migration'', Paris, Payot, 1980.</ref> Their [[petty kingdom]]s are now known by the names of the French counties that succeeded them\u2014[[Domnon\u00e9e]] ([[Devon]]), [[Cornouaille]] ([[Cornwall]]), [[Viscounty of L\u00e9on|L\u00e9on]] ([[Caerleon]]); but these names in Breton and [[Latin]] are in most cases identical to their British homelands. (In Breton and French, however, [[Gwened (kingdom)|Gwened]] or [[Pays Vannetais|Vannetais]] continued the name of the indigenous [[Veneti (Gauls)|Veneti]].) Although the details remain confused, these colonies consisted of related and intermarried dynasties which repeatedly unified (as by the 7th-century [[Saint Judica\u00ebl]]) before splintering again according to Celtic inheritance practices. \n\nThe area was finally consolidated in the 840s under [[Nominoe]] in resistance to [[Franks|Frank]]ish control.<ref>Smith, Julia M. H. ''Province and Empire: Brittany and the Carolingians'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, pp.80\u201383.</ref> Among the immigrant Britons, there were some clergymen who helped the [[evangelisation]] of the region, which was still pagan, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[[File:Britonia6hcentury.png|thumb|left|The [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] community around the 6th century. The sea was a communication medium rather than a barrier.]]\n\n===Battle of the Catalaunian Plains===\nThe army recruited for [[Flavius Aetius]] to combat [[Attila the Hun]] at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]] included Romans, Visigoths, Franks, Alans and Armoricans, amongst others.  The Alans were placed front and centre, opposite the Huns. The Armoricans supplied archers who attacked the Huns' front lines during the main battle and thwarted Attila's night assault on the Roman camp with a hail of arrows \"like rain\".  After the battle was won, Aetius sent the Alans to Armorica and Galicia.\n\n===Riothamus===\nThe late 5th century Brittonic leader [[Riothamus]] received correspondence from the eminent Roman jurist [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] and was called \"King of the Britons\" by [[Jordanes]].  Some suggest that he was a Breton, though others believe that he was from Britain, pointing to the passage that he arrived in the land of the Biturges \"by way of Ocean\", which would hardly have been efficient or required for a Breton.  Both historians describe Riothamus's losing battle against King [[Euric]] of the Visigoths at [[D\u00e9ols]] around the year 470.  \n\nIn response to a plea from the Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]], Riothamus had led twelve thousand men to establish a military presence in [[Bourges]] in central Gaul, but was betrayed by [[Arvandus]], the Praetorian Prefect of Gaul, and subsequently ambushed by Euric's army.{{efn|The Visigoths' version of events was that they had saved the Roman empire from a British invasion.}} After a long battle, the Armorican survivors escaped to [[Avallon]] in [[Burgundy]], after which they are lost to history.  According to Breton king-lists, Riotham survived and reigned as Prince of [[Domnonia]] until his death sometime between 500 and 520, though this may have been a different person.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Nominoe triumphant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A 1922 nationalist engraving of [[Nominoe]], first king of Brittany.]]\n[[File:Battle of La Roche-Derrien.jpg|Right|thumb|upright|[[Battle of La Roche-Derrien|Battle of Ar Roc'h-Derrien]] during the [[War of the Breton Succession]]]]\nAt the beginning of the medieval era, Brittany was divided between three kingdoms, [[Domnon\u00e9e|Domnonea]], [[Cornouaille]] and [[Bro\u00ebrec]].

His son [[Erispoe]] secured the independence of the new kingdom of Brittany and won the [[Battle of Jengland]] against [[Charles the Bald]]. The Bretons won another war in 867, and the kingdom reached then its maximum extent: it received parts of [[Normandy]], [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]] and [[Anjou]] and the [[Channel Islands]].\n\nBrittany was heavily attacked by the [[Vikings]] at the beginning of the 10th century. The kingdom lost its eastern territories, including [[Normandy]] and [[Anjou]], and the county of [[Nantes]] was given to [[Fulk I, Count of Anjou|Fulk I of Anjou]] in 909. However, Nantes was seized by the Vikings in 914, and was eventually liberated by [[Alan II, Duke of Brittany|Alan II of Brittany]] in 937 with the support of his god-brother King [[\u00c6thelstan]] of England. Alan II totally expelled the Vikings from Brittany and recreated a strong Breton state. He paid homage to [[Louis IV of France]] (who was \u00c6thelstan's nephew and had returned from England in the same year as Alan II) and thus Brittany ceased to be a kingdom and became a duchy.\n\nSeveral Breton lords helped [[William the Conqueror]] to invade England and received large estates there (e.g. William's double-second cousin [[Alan Rufus]] and the latter's brother [[Brian of Brittany]]). Some of these lords were powerful rivals. Medieval Brittany was far from being a united nation. The French king maintained envoys in Brittany, alliances contracted by local lords often overlapped and there was no specific Breton consciousness. For example, Brittany replaced [[Latin]] with French as its official language in the 13th century, 300 years before France did so itself, and the [[Breton language]] never had any formal status. The [[foreign policy]] of the duchy changed many times; the dukes were usually independent but they often contracted alliances with England or France. Their support for each nation became very important during the 14th century, because the English kings then started to claim the French throne.\n\nThe [[Breton War of Succession]], a local episode of the [[Hundred Years' War]], saw the House of [[Blois]], backed by the French, fighting with the House of [[Montfort of Brittany|Montfort]], backed by the English. The Montforts won in 1364 and enjoyed a period of total independence until the end of the Hundred Years' War, because France was weakened and stopped sending royal envoys to the Court of Brittany.  English diplomatic failures led to the Breton cavalry commanders Arthur, Comte de Richemont (later to become [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany]]) and his nephew [[Peter II, Duke of Brittany]] playing key roles on the French side during the deciding stages of the War (the [[Battle of Patay]], the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)]], the [[Battle of Formigny]] and the [[Battle of Castillon]]).  However, Brittany lost the [[Mad War]] against France in 1488, mostly because of its internal divisions which were exacerbated by the corruption at the court of [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]]. Indeed, some Breton lords were fighting on the French side.\n\n===Union with the French Crown and modern period===\n{{main|Union of Brittany and France}}\n[[File:Anne de bretagne.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne of Brittany]] is regarded in Brittany as a conscientious ruler who defended the duchy against France.]]\nAfter the [[Mad War]], the duke [[Francis II of Brittany|Francis II]] could not marry off his daughter [[Anne of Brittany|Anne]] without the King of France's consent. Nonetheless, she married the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1490, but this led to a severe crisis with France. [[Charles VIII of France]] besieged [[Rennes]] and had the marriage cancelled. He eventually married [[Anne of Brittany]]. After he died childless, the duchess had to marry his heir and cousin [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]]. Anne unsuccessfully tried to preserve Breton independence, but she died in 1514 and the union between the two crowns was formally carried out by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1532. He granted several privileges to Brittany, such as exemption from the [[gabelle]], a tax on salt which was very unpopular in France.<ref>Constance De La Warr, ''A Twice Crowned Queen: Anne of Brittany'', Peter Owen, 2005</ref>  Under the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], Brittany and France were governed as separate countries under the same crown, so Breton aristocrats in the French [[Court (royal)|royal court]] were classed as [[Prince \u00e9tranger|Princes \u00e9trangers]] (foreign princes).\n\nFrom the 15th to the 18th century, Brittany reached an economic golden age.{{efn|Brittany was proverbially wealthy throughout much of its history: it prospered from trade before and during Roman rule, mid-ninth century legal documents reveal peasant landowners suing lords for trespass. The House of [[Counts and dukes of Penthi\u00e8vre|Penthi\u00e8vre]] was wealthy, Breton dowries raised impoverished nobles such as [[Jean II de Brosse]] to riches, and Duchess Anne's fortune contributed to the [[French Renaissance]], to palaces such as [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] and to the [[Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley]]}} The region was located on the seaways between Spain, England and the [[Netherlands]] and it greatly benefited from the creation of a [[French colonial empire]]. Local seaports like [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Saint-Brieuc]] quickly expanded, and [[Lorient]], first spelled \"L'Orient\", was founded in the 17th century. [[Saint-Malo]] was then known for its [[French corsairs|corsairs]], Brest was a major base for the [[French Navy]] and [[Nantes]] flourished with the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. On its side, the inland provided [[hemp]] ropes and canvas and [[linen]] sheets. However, [[Colbertism]], which encouraged the creation of many factories, did not favour the Breton industry because most of the royal factories were opened in other provinces. Moreover, several conflicts between France and England led the latter to restrain its trade, and the Breton economy went into recession during the 18th century.\n\nTwo significant revolts occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries: the [[Revolt of the papier timbr\u00e9]] (1675) and the [[Pontcallec conspiracy]] (1719). Both arose from attempts to resist centralisation and assert Breton constitutional exceptions to tax.<ref>Jo\u00ebl Cornette, Le marquis et le R\u00e9gent.

Brittany also lost all its privileges. Three years later, the area became a centre of [[royalist]] and Catholic resistance to the Revolution during the [[Chouannerie]]. During the 19th century, Brittany remained in economic recession, and many Bretons emigrated to other French regions, particularly to Paris. This trend remained strong until the beginning of the 20th century. Nonetheless, the region was also modernising, with new roads and railways being built, and some places being industrialised. [[Nantes]] specialised in [[shipbuilding]] and food processing (sugar, exotic fruits and vegetables, fish...), [[Foug\u00e8res]] in glass and shoe production, and [[metallurgy]] was practised in small towns such as [[Ch\u00e2teaubriant]] and [[Inzinzac-Lochrist|Lochrist]], known for its [[labour movement]]s.\n\nThe region remained deeply Catholic, and during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], the conservative values were strongly reasserted. When the Republic was re-established in 1871, there were rumours that Breton troops were mistrusted and mistreated at [[Camp Conlie]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] because of fears that they were a threat to the Republic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rennes.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/Telechargements/rennais/rn382/histoire.pdf |title=Rennes, guide histoire |format=PDF |accessdate=3 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718175622/http://www.rennes.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/Telechargements/rennais/rn382/histoire.pdf |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:RAF attack Saint Malo 31 Jul 1942.jpg|thumb|A [[Royal Air Force]] attack on [[Saint-Malo]] in 1942.]]\nDuring the 19th century, the [[Breton language]] started to decline precipitously, mainly because of the [[Francization]] policy conducted under the [[Third French Republic|Third Republic]].

It was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940 and freed after [[Operation Cobra]] in August 1944. However, the areas around [[Saint-Nazaire]] and [[Lorient]] only surrendered on 10 and 11 May 1945, several days after the German capitulation. The two port towns had been virtually destroyed by Allied air raids, like [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Saint-Malo]], and other towns, such as [[Nantes]] and [[Rennes]], had also suffered.\n\nIn 1956, Brittany was legally reconstituted as the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Region of Brittany]], although the region excluded the ducal capital of [[Nantes]] and the [[Loire-Atlantique|surrounding area]]. Nevertheless, Brittany retained its cultural distinctiveness, and a new cultural revival emerged during the 1960s and 1970s. Bilingual schools were opened, singers started to write songs in Breton, and ecological catastrophes such as the [[Amoco Cadiz oil spill]] or the [[MV Erika|Erika oil spill]] and water pollution because of intensive pig farming favoured new movements to protect the natural heritage.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{See also|Politics of France}}\n\n===Traditional subdivisions===\n\nBrittany as a political entity disappeared in 1790, when it was divided into five [[d\u00e9partement]]s. The Breton d\u00e9partements more or less correspond to the nine Catholic [[diocese]]s that appeared at the beginning of the Middle Ages. They were often called \"pays\" or \"bro\" (\"country\" in French and [[Breton language|Breton]]) and they also served as fiscal and military districts.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Mikael Bodlore-Penlaez and Divi Kervella|title=Atlas de Bretagne \u2013 Atlas Breizh|publisher=Coop Breizh|year=2011|isbn=978-2-84346-496-6|page=100}}</ref> Brittany is also divided between ''[[Lower Brittany]]'' (\"Basse Bretagne\" and \"Breizh Izel\"), corresponding to the western half, where [[Breton language|Breton]] is traditionally spoken, and ''[[Upper Brittany]]'' (\"Haute Bretagne\" and \"Breizh Uhel\"), corresponding to the eastern half, where [[Gallo language|Gallo]] is traditionally spoken.

When it was an independent duchy, the [[Estates of Brittany]], which can be compared to a parliament, met in various towns: [[Dinan]], [[Plo\u00ebrmel]], [[Redon]], [[Rennes]], [[Vitr\u00e9, Ille-et-Vilaine|Vitr\u00e9]], [[Gu\u00e9rande]], and, most of all, [[Vannes]], where they met 19 times, and [[Nantes]], 17 times. The Court and the government were also very mobile, and each dynasty favoured its own castles and estates. The dukes mostly lived in [[Nantes]], [[Vannes]], [[Redon]], [[Rennes]], [[Foug\u00e8res]], [[Dol-de-Bretagne]], [[Dinan]] and [[Gu\u00e9rande]]. All these towns except Vannes are located in [[Upper Brittany]], thus not in the Breton speaking area.\n\nAmong all these towns, only [[Nantes]], [[Rennes]] and [[Vannes]], which were the biggest ones, could really pretend to the capital status. The dukes were crowned in Rennes and they had a large castle there; it was however destroyed during the 15th century. Vannes, on its side, was the seat of the Chamber of Accounts and of the Parliament until the union with France. The Parliament was then transferred to Rennes, and the Chamber of Accounts to Nantes. Nantes, nicknamed \"the city of the Dukes of Brittany\", was also the permanent residence of the last dukes. The [[Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne]] still stands in the city centre. Nowadays, [[Rennes]] is the only official capital of the [[Brittany (administrative region)|region of Brittany]]. It is also the seat of an [[ecclesiastical province]] encompassing Brittany and the [[Pays de la Loire]] region.\n\n===Present subdivisions===\n{{see also|Administrative divisions of France|Brittany (administrative region)|Loire-Atlantique}}\n[[File:Bretagne historique 2.png|thumb|The [[Brittany (administrative region)|region Brittany]] comprises four historical Breton ''d\u00e9partements''. [[Loire-Atlantique]], in light blue, is part of the [[Pays de la Loire]] region.]]\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], Brittany was divided into five ''[[d\u00e9partement]]s'', each made up of three or four ''[[arrondissements of France|arrondissements]]''. The arrondissements are further divided in [[cantons of France|cantons]], which are themselves made up of one or several [[communes of France|communes]]. The communes and the d\u00e9partements have a local council elected by their citizens, but arrondissements and cantons are not run by elected officials. The cantons serve as an [[electoral]] district for the election of the d\u00e9partement councils and arrondissements are run by a subprefect appointed by the [[President of the French Republic|French president]]. The president also appoints a prefect in each d\u00e9partement.\n\nBecause the d\u00e9partements are small and numerous, the French government tried to create wider regions during the 20th century. For the Breton nationalists, it was an occasion to recreate Brittany as a political and administrative entity, but the new region had to be economically efficient. [[Nantes]] and its ''d\u00e9partement'', [[Loire-Atlantique]], raised concerns because they were off-centered, more integrated with the [[Loire Valley]] than with the Breton peninsula. The French government and local politicians also feared that [[Nantes]], because of its population and its former Breton capital status, would have maintained a harmful competition with [[Rennes]] to get the regional institutions and investments.\n\nSeveral drafts for French regions had been proposed since the 1920s, and the definitive regions were drawn in 1956. The new Brittany had four d\u00e9partements, and [[Loire-Atlantique]] formed the [[Pays de la Loire]] region together with parts of [[Anjou]], [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]] and [[Poitou]]. In 1972, the regions received their present competencies, with an elected regional council. Since then, the [[Brittany (administrative region)|region of Brittany]] has had its own [[Regional Council of Brittany|council]] and administrative bodies.\n\n===Reunification===\n{{see also|Bretagne R\u00e9unie}}\n[[File:Bienvenue en Bretagne historique.jpg|thumb|This [[Loire-Atlantique]] road sign reads \"welcome to historical Brittany\".]]\nWhen the [[Brittany (administrative region)|region of Brittany]] was created, several local politicians opposed the exclusion of [[Loire-Atlantique]], and the question still remains.\n\nThe obstacles to reunification are the same as in 1956: having [[Nantes]] in Brittany could harm the position of [[Rennes]] and create an economic imbalance between [[Lower Brittany|Lower]] and [[Upper Brittany]]. Moreover, the [[Pays de la Loire]] region could not exist without [[Loire-Atlantique]], because it would lose its political and economic capital. Without Loire-Atlantique, the other d\u00e9partements would not form an efficient region any more, and would have to integrate neighbouring regions such as the [[Centre-Val de Loire]] and [[Poitou-Charentes]].\n\nHowever, several institutions have backed the reunification, such as the regional council of Brittany since 2008 and the Loire-Atlantique council since 2001. Some politicians like [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]], the French prime minister and former [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Nantes]], favour instead the creation of a \"Greater West region\", which would encompass Brittany and the [[Pays de la Loire]] region. Polls show that 58% of the Bretons and 62% of the inhabitants in [[Loire-Atlantique]] favour the reunification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/story/47615/bretagne-nantes-guerre-frontieres|title=Bretagne, la guerre des fronti\u00e8res|date=20 December 2011|editor=Slate.fr}}</ref>\n\n===Political tendencies===\n{{main|Politics of Brittany}}\nUntil the end of the 20th century, Brittany had been characterised by a strong Catholic and conservative influence. However, some areas such as the industrial region around [[Saint-Nazaire]] and [[Lorient]] and the surroundings of [[Tr\u00e9guier]] are traditional Socialist and Communist strongholds. Left-wing parties, mainly the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist party]] and [[the Greens (France)|the Greens]], have become more and more powerful after the 1970s and they have formed a majority in the [[Regional Council of Brittany]] since 2004. The [[Loire-Atlantique]] and [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] councils have also been held by the left since 2004. \n\nThe Socialist party has held the [[C\u00f4tes-d'Armor]] council since 1976, and the [[Finist\u00e8re]] council since 1998. On its side, [[Morbihan]] remains a right-wing stronghold. The local parties have a very small audience, except the [[Union D\u00e9mocratique Bretonne]] which has seats at the Regional Council and in other local assemblies. It advocates more autonomy for the region and its positions are very close to the Socialist parties. It also has a strong ecological orientation. The audience of far-right parties is lower in Brittany than in the rest of France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rue89.com/2012/04/04/la-bretagne-terre-de-resistance-lextreme-droite-230769|title=La Bretagne, terre de r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame droite|editor=Rue89|date=4 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and natural history==\n[[File:Bretagne Cote granit rose 01.jpg|thumb|The [[C\u00f4te de Granit Rose|Pink Granite Coast]] around [[Tr\u00e9gastel]].]]\nBrittany is the largest French [[peninsula]]. It is around {{convert|34030|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and stretches towards the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered to the north by the [[English Channel]], to the south by the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the waters located between the western coast and [[Ushant|Ushant island]] form the [[Iroise Sea]].\n\nThe Breton coast is very indented, with many cliffs, [[ria]]s and [[Cape (geography)|cape]]s. The [[Gulf of Morbihan]] is a vast [[natural harbour]] with some forty islands that is almost a closed sea. In total, around 800 islands lie off the mainland; the largest being [[Belle \u00cele]], in the south. Brittany has over {{convert|2860|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline; it represents a third of the total French coastline.\n\nThe region is generally hilly because it corresponds to the western end of the [[Armorican massif]], a very old range that also extends in [[Normandy]] and the [[Pays de la Loire]] region. Because of this continuity, the Breton border with the rest of France is not marked by any strong geographical landmark, apart from the river [[Couesnon]], which separates Brittany from [[Normandy]].\n\n[[File:L'ELLez pr\u00e8s de sa source.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bog]] around the [[Monts d'Arr\u00e9e]].]]\nThe [[Armorican massif]] reaches its maximal elevation outside of Brittany, in neighbouring [[Mayenne]], at 417 m, and slopes towards the west before straightening on its western extremity, with the [[Montagnes Noires]] and the [[Monts d'Arr\u00e9e]]. The highest hill in Brittany is the ''Roc'h Ruz'' in the Monts d'Arr\u00e9e, at {{convert|385|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is closely followed by several neighbouring hills culminating at around 384 m above sea level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.plouneour-menez.fr/fr/patrimoine-naturel.php|title=Le Roc'h RUZ , point culminant de la Bretagne|editor=Ploum\u00e9our-M\u00e9nez}}</ref>\n\nCoastal areas are usually named ''Armor'' or ''Arvor'' (\"by the sea\" in Breton), and the inland is called ''Argoat'' (\"by the forest\"). The best soils were primitively covered by large forests which had been progressively replaced by [[bocage]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. The Breton bocage, with its small fields enclosed by thick hedgerows, has almost disappeared since the 1960s to fit the modern agricultural needs and methods, particularly mechanisation.\n\nSeveral forests still exist, such as the [[Paimpont forest]], sometimes said to be the Arthurian [[Broc\u00e9liande]]. The poor and rocky areas are covered by large [[heathland]] and [[moorland]]s, and Brittany has several [[marsh]]es, like the [[Bri\u00e8re]], included in a [[Regional natural parks of France|regional natural park]]. Another regional park encompasses the [[Monts d'Arr\u00e9e]] and the [[Iroise Sea|Iroise]] seacoast. The Iroise Sea is also a [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|UNESCO biosphere reserve]].\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Bretagne Finistere PointeduRaz15119.jpg|thumb|The [[Pointe du Raz]], one of the westernmost extents of both Brittany and Metropolitan France.]]\nThe Breton peninsula appeared during the [[Cadomian Orogeny]], which formed its northern coastline, between [[Guingamp]] and [[Foug\u00e8res]]. The southern part emerged during the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogeny]]. At the same time, an intense volcanic activity left large quantities of [[granite]]. Between the Cadomian and Hercynian periods, the region was submerged several times and the sea left [[fossil]]s and [[sedimentary rock]]s, mostly [[schist]] and [[sandstone]]. Because of the absence of [[limestone]], soils in Brittany are usually acid. \n\nThe [[Armorican massif]] straightened and flattened several times during the formation of the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]]. Changes in sea levels and climate led to a strong erosion and to the formation of more [[sedimentary rock]]s. [[Metamorphism]] is responsible for the distinctive local blue schist and for the rich subsoil of the [[Groix|Groix island]], which comprises [[glaucophane]] and [[epidote]].<ref name=\"geology\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bretagne-environnement.org/Sous-sol/Le-contexte-breton/Histoire-geologique|title=L'histoire g\u00e9ologique de la Bretagne|editor=Portail de l'information environnementale en Bretagne|author=Emmanu\u00e8le Savelli|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320132724/http://www.bretagne-environnement.org/Sous-sol/Le-contexte-breton/Histoire-geologique|archivedate=20 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Quaternary]] glaciations, Brittany was covered by [[loess]] and rivers started to fill the valleys with alluvial deposits. The valleys themselves were a result of a strong tectonic activity between the [[African plate|African]] and the [[Eurasian plate]]. The present Breton landscape did not acquired its final shape before one million years ago. The Breton subsoil is characterised by a huge amount of [[fracture (geology)|fractures]] that form a large [[aquifer]] containing several millions square meters of water.<ref name=\"geology\"/>\n\n===Climate===\nBrittany lies within the [[Temperateness|north temperate zone]]. It has a changeable, [[maritime climate]], similar to [[Cornwall]]. Rainfall occurs regularly but sunny, cloudless days are also common. In the summer months, temperatures in the region can reach {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, yet the climate remains comfortable, especially when compared to the French regions located south of the [[Loire River|Loire]]. The temperature difference between summer and winter is about fifteen degrees, but it varies depending on the proximity of the sea. The weather is generally milder on the seacoast than inland but rainfall occurs with the same intensity on both. The [[Monts d'Arr\u00e9e]], despite their low elevation, have much more rainfall than the rest of the region. The south coast, between [[Lorient]] and [[Pornic]], enjoys more than 2,000 hours of sunshine per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/index.php?s=&d=|title=Normales et records des stations m\u00e9t\u00e9o de France \u2013 Infoclimat|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n[[File:Poissonlune mole2.jpg|thumb|An [[ocean sunfish]] exhibiting its characteristic horizontal basking behaviour several miles off [[Penmarch]].]]\nBrittany's wildlife is typical of France with several distinctions. On one hand, the region, due to its long coastline, has a rich oceanic fauna, and some birds cannot be seen in other French regions. On the other hand, the species found in the inland are usually common for France, and because Brittany is a peninsula, the number of species is lower in its western extremity than in the eastern part.\n\nA variety of seabirds can be seen close to the seaside, which is home to colonies of [[Great cormorant|cormorants]], [[European herring gull|gulls]], [[razorbill]]s, [[northern gannet]]s, [[common murre]]s and [[Atlantic puffin]]s.

As in other French regions, formal education before the 19th century was the preserve of the elite. Before 1460, Brittany did not have a university, and Breton students had to go to [[Angers]], [[Poitiers]] or [[Caen]]. The [[University of Nantes]] was founded under the duke [[Francis II of Brittany|Francis II]], who wanted to affirm the Breton independence from France. All the traditional disciplines were taught here: arts, theology, law and medicine. During the 17th century, it had around 1,500 students. It declined during the 18th century, mostly because [[Nantes]] was flourishing with the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and paid no attention to its cultural institutions. \n\nA [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] eventually asked the university to be relocated to [[Rennes]], more devoted to culture and science, and the faculties progressively moved there after 1735.<ref name=\"ind\u00e9pendance\">''[http://www.espace-sciences.org/science/10065-sciences-ouest/20106-Annee-1993/10235-93/10880-gros-plan/16926-histoire/16927-la-lente-mise-en-place-des/index.html \u00abLa Lente Mise en Place des Universit\u00e9s Bretonnes\u00bb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319203017/http://www.espace-sciences.org/science/10065-sciences-ouest/20106-Annee-1993/10235-93/10880-gros-plan/16926-histoire/16927-la-lente-mise-en-place-des/index.html |date=19 March 2012 }}'', Science Ouest N\u00b093</ref> The transfer was interrupted by the [[French Revolution]], and all the French universities were dissolved in 1793.\n\n[[Napoleon]] reorganised the French education system in 1808.

A new [[University of Rennes]] was progressively recreated during the 19th century. In the meantime, several laws were promoted to open schools, notably for girls. In 1882, [[Jules Ferry]] succeeded in passing a law which made primary education in France free, non-clerical (la\u00efque) and mandatory. Thus, free schools were opened in almost every villages of Brittany. Jules Ferry also promoted education policies establishing French language as the language of the Republic, and mandatory education was a mean to eradicate regional languages and dialects. In Brittany, it was forbidden for the pupils to speak [[Breton language|Breton]] or [[Gallo language|Gallo]], and the two were strongly depreciated.

The number of exploitations tends to diminish, but as a result, they are merged into very large estates. Brittany is the first producer in France for vegetables ([[green bean]]s, onions, [[artichoke]]s, potatoes, tomatoes...). Cereals are mostly grown for cattle feeding. Wine, especially [[muscadet]], is made in a small region south of [[Nantes]]. Brittany is the first region in France for fishing.

Nonetheless, French was not widely known before the 19th century, and two [[regional language]]s exist in Brittany: [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Gallo language|Gallo]]. They are separated by a [[language border]] that has constantly moved back since the Middle Ages. \n\nThe current border runs from [[Plouha]] on the [[English Channel]] to the [[Rhuys Peninsula]] on the [[Bay of Biscay]]. Because of their origins and practice, Breton and Gallo can be compared to [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Scots language]] in Scotland{{Citation needed|reason=the Breton and Gallo pages linked to here suggest this sentence is incorrect|date=October 2019}}. Both have been recognised as \"Langues de Bretagne\" (languages of Brittany) by the [[Regional Council of Brittany]] since 2004.\n\n====Breton====\n{{main|Breton language}}\n[[File:Road signs bilingual Breton in Quimper.jpg|thumb|left|Bilingual road signs can be seen in traditional Breton-speaking areas.]]\nBreton is a [[Celtic language]] derived from the historical [[Common Brittonic]] language, and is most closely related to [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. It was imported to Western [[Armorica]] during the 5th century by Britons fleeing the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain]]. Since the 13th century, long before the [[union of Brittany and France]], the main administrative language of the Duchy of Brittany had been French, which had evolved from Latin. Breton remained the language of the rural population, but since the [[Middle Ages]] the [[bourgeoisie]], the [[nobility]], and the higher clergy have spoken French.\n\nGovernment policies in the 19th and 20th centuries made education compulsory and, at the same time, forbade the use of Breton in schools to push non-French speakers into adopting the French language. Nevertheless, until the 1960s Breton was spoken or understood by many of the inhabitants of western Brittany. During the 1970s, Breton schools were opened and the local authorities started to promote the language, which was on the brink of extinction because parents had stopped teaching it to their children.\n\nHaving declined from more than one million speakers around 1950 to about 200,000 in the first decade of the 21st century, of whom 61% are more than 60 years old, Breton is classified as \"severely endangered\" by the UNESCO [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]]. However, the number of children attending bilingual classes has risen 33% between 2006 and 2012 to 14,709.<ref name=\"Broudic2009\">[[Fa\u00f1ch Broudic]], 2009.

Most of them are very similar to each other, with only some phonetic and lexical differences. The three main dialects spoken in the western end of Brittany, the '''Cornouillais'', around [[Quimper]], the ''L\u00e9onard'', around [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on]], and the ''Tr\u00e9gorrois'', around [[Tr\u00e9guier]], are grouped into the ''KLT group'' (Kerne-Leon-Treger), in opposition to the ''Vannetais'', spoken around [[Vannes]], which is the most differentiated Breton dialect.\n\nAccording to a 1999 INSEE survey, 12% of the adults of Brittany speak Breton.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 2003|title=Langue bretonne et autres langues : pratique et transmission|url=https://www.epsilon.insee.fr/jspui/bitstream/1/11835/1/oc92_lan.pdf|journal=INSEE|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n====Gallo====\n{{main|Gallo language}}\n[[File:Parc\u00e9 - panneau D23.jpg|thumb|Signs in Gallo are very rare and the writing systems they use are unknown by most of the speakers.]]\nGallo is spoken on the eastern half of Brittany. It is not itself a Celtic language. Like French, it is also descended from Latin (and is classified in the [[Langues d'o\u00efl]] branch), but has some Celtic influences, particularly in its vocabulary, whereas French has influences from both Celtic ([[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]) and [[Frankish language|Frankish]] (the [[Germanic language]] which arrived after Latin in much of the rest of France).\n\nUnlike Breton, Gallo does not have a long promotion history and it is still often perceived as a poor rural dialect. Moreover, because of its linguistic relationship with Gallo, French imposed itself more easily as the main language in [[Upper Brittany]] than in Breton speaking areas. Gallo was simply felt to be an incorrect way of speaking French rather than a separate language. Gallo transmission from parents to children is extremely low and efforts to standardise and publish books in Gallo did not reverse the decline of the language and its lack of [[prestige dialect|prestige]].<ref name=\"rapport\"/>\n\nGallo is also threatened by the Breton [[language revival]], because Breton is gaining ground in territories that were not previously part of the main Breton-speaking area, and most of all because Breton appears as the national language of Brittany, thus leaving no place for Gallo.<ref name=\"rapport\"/>\n\nGallo had never been written before the 20th century, and several writing systems were created. They are however rarely known by the population and signs in Gallo are often unreadable, even for fluent speakers. In [[Loire-Atlantique]], where Gallo is not promoted at all by the local authorities, many people do not even know the word \"Gallo\" and have no idea that it has writing systems and publications.<ref name=\"rapport\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.prefics.org/credilif/travaux/RapportGallo1.pdf|title=Pratiques et repr\u00e9sentations de la langue et de la culture r\u00e9gionales en Haute Bretagne|author=Andr\u00e9 Le Coq & Philippe Blanchet|editor=Centre de Recherche sur la Diversit\u00e9Linguistique de la Francophonie|year=2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002225736/http://www.prefics.org/credilif/travaux/RapportGallo1.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Gallo community is estimated at between 28,300<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/insee_regions/bretagne/themes/octant/oc92/oc92art3.pdf|title=Langue bretonne et autres langues : pratique et transmission|editor=INSEE}}</ref> and 200,000<ref name=\"rapport\"/> speakers.

During the Briton emigration to Brittany, several Christian missionaries, mostly Welsh, came in the region and founded dioceses. They are known as the \"Seven founder saints\":\n* [[Paul Aurelian|Paol Aoreliann]], at [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on]],\n* [[Tudwal]], at [[Tr\u00e9guier]],\n* [[Brioc|Brieg]], at [[Saint-Brieuc]],\n* [[Malo (saint)|Malo\u00f9]], at [[Saint-Malo]],\n* [[Samson of Dol|Samsun of Dol]], at [[Dol-de-Bretagne]],\n* [[Padarn]], at [[Vannes]],\n* [[Corentin of Quimper|Kaourintin]], at [[Quimper, Finist\u00e8re|Quimper]].\n\nOther notable early missionaries are [[Gildas]] and the Irish saint [[Columbanus]]. In total, Brittany numbers more than 300 \"[[saint]]s\" (only a few recognised by the Catholic Church) and, since the 19th century at least, it has been known as one of the most devoutly Catholic regions in France, together with the neighbouring [[Pays de la Loire]] region. The proportion of students attending Catholic private schools is the highest in France. The [[patron saint]] of Brittany is [[Saint Anne]], the Virgin's mother, but [[Ivo of Kermartin]], a 13th-century priest, called Saint-Yves in French and Sant-Erwan in Breton, can also be considered as a patron saint. His feast, the 19 May, is Brittany's national day.\n\n[[File:FRANCE - Bretagne - Locronan - Chapelle.JPG|thumb|left|A chapel and a calvary in [[Locronan]], Finist\u00e8re.]]\nMany distinctive traditions and customs have also been preserved in Brittany. Among them, the \"[[Pardon (ceremony)|Pardon]]s\" are one of the most traditional demonstrations of popular Catholicism. These [[sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|penitential ceremonies]] occur in some villages in [[Lower Brittany]] on the [[feast day]] of the parish's saint. The penitents form a procession and they walk together to a [[shrine]], a church or any sacred place. Some Pardons are reputed for their length, and they all finish by large meals and popular feasts.\n\n[[File:002 Ploudiry ossuaire 2 ankou.JPG|thumb|A sculpted [[Ankou]] in [[Ploudiry]].]]\nThere is a very old [[pilgrimage]] called the ''[[Tro Breizh]]'' (tour of Brittany), where the pilgrims walk around Brittany from the grave of one of the seven founder saints to another. Historically, the pilgrimage was made in one trip (a total distance of around 600&nbsp;km) for all seven saints. Nowadays, however, pilgrims complete the circuit over the course of several years. In 2002, the Tro Breizh included a special pilgrimage to [[Wales]], symbolically making the reverse journey of the Welshmen Sant Paol, Sant Brieg, and Sant Samzun.<ref>''Bretagne: poems'' (in French), by Amand Gu\u00e9rin,\nPublished by P. Masgana, 1842: page 238</ref>\n\nThe most powerful folk figure is the [[Ankou]] or the \"Reaper of Death\". Sometimes a skeleton wrapped in a shroud with the Breton flat hat, sometimes described as a real human being (the last dead of the year, devoted to bring the dead to Death), he makes his journeys by night carrying an upturned scythe which he throws before him to reap his harvest. Sometimes he is on foot but mostly he travels with a cart, the ''Karrig an Ankou'', drawn by two oxen and a lean horse. Two servants dressed in the same shroud and hat as the Ankou pile the dead into the cart, and to hear it creaking at night means you have little time left to live.<ref>[[Anatole le Braz]], ''La Legende de la Mort'', BiblioBazaar reprint, LLC, 2009, pp. 430ff.</ref>\n\nAs official religious statistics are forbidden in France, there are no official figures about religious practices in Brittany. However, successive polls show that the region tends to be more and more [[irreligion|nonreligious]]. Catholic religion has started to decline after the [[Second World War]], during the urbanisation of Brittany. A poll conducted in 2006 showed that [[Morbihan]] was the only ''[[d\u00e9partement]]'' to have a strong Catholic population, around 70% of its inhabitants belonging to that religion. [[Loire-Atlantique]] and [[C\u00f4tes-d'Armor]] were among the least Catholic French ''d\u00e9partements'', with only 50% of Catholics, while [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] and [[Finist\u00e8re]] were at around 65%. Other religions are almost non-existent, apart from [[Islam]] which gathers between 1 and 3% of the inhabitants in [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] and [[Loire-Atlantique]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifop.com/media/poll/religions_geo.pdf|title=\u00c9l\u00e9ments d'analyse g\u00e9ographique de l'implantation des religions en France|editor=Ifop|date=December 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Fr Josselin Castle from river with flowers.JPG|thumb|[[Josselin Castle]].]]\nBrittany is home to many [[megalith]]ic monuments; the words ''[[menhir]]'' and ''[[dolmen]]'' come from the [[Breton language]]. The largest menhir alignments are the [[Carnac stones]]. Other major sites include the [[Barnenez]] [[cairn]], the [[Locmariaquer megaliths]], the [[Menhir de Champ-Dolent]], the [[Mane Braz]] [[tumulus]] and the [[Gavrinis]] tomb. Monuments from the [[Roman Gaul|Roman]] period are rare, but include a large temple in [[Corseul]] and scarce ruins of villas and city walls in [[Rennes]] and [[Nantes]].\n\nBrittany has a large number of medieval buildings. They include numerous [[Romanesque style|Romanesque]] and [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] churches, usually built in local [[sandstone]] and [[granite|granit]], castles and half-timbered houses visible in villages, towns and cities. Several Breton towns still have their medieval walls, such as [[Gu\u00e9rande]], [[Concarneau]], [[Saint-Malo]], [[Vannes]], [[Foug\u00e8res]] and [[Dinan]]. Major churches include [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on Cathedral]], [[Tr\u00e9guier Cathedral]], [[Dol Cathedral]], [[Nantes Cathedral]] and the [[Kreisker chapel]]. Most of the Breton castles were rebuilt between the 13th and the 15th century, such as the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Suscinio]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Dinan]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Combourg]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Largo\u00ebt]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Tonqu\u00e9dec]], the [[Josselin Castle]] and the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Tr\u00e9cesson]]. The most impressive castles can be seen along the border with France, where stand the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Foug\u00e8res]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vitr\u00e9]], the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2teaubriant]] and the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Clisson]].\n\n[[File:Cahire.JPG|thumb|left|A traditional house in [[Plougoumelen]].]]\nThe [[French Renaissance]] occurred when Brittany lost its independence. The Renaissance architecture is almost absent in the region, except in [[Upper Brittany]], close to the border with France. Major sites include the [[Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne]], the last permanent residence of the dukes, which displays the transition from late Gothic to Renaissance style. The [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2teaubriant]], a former fortress, was transformed into a vast palace in the Italian style.\n\n[[File:B\u00e9nodet - Le Minaret.jpg|thumb|An [[Art Deco]] villa in [[B\u00e9nodet]].]]\nIn [[Lower Brittany]], the medieval style never totally disappeared. However, local innovations permitted some changes and the birth of a particular style. Its most distinctive feature is the [[parish close]], which displays an elaborately decorated church surrounded by an entirely walled churchyard. Many villages still have their closes, they date from the 16th and 17th centuries and sometimes include an elaborately carved [[calvary (sculpture)|calvary sculpture]].\n\nDuring the 17th and the 18th centuries, the main [[seaport]]s and towns obtained a typical French look, with [[baroque]] and [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] buildings. [[Nantes]], which was at the time the biggest French harbour, received a theatre, large avenues and quays, and [[Rennes]] was redesigned after a fire in 1720. At the same period, the wealthy [[ship-owner]]s from [[Saint-Malo]] built many mansions called \"Malouini\u00e8res\" around their town. Along the coast, [[Vauban]] and other French architects designed several citadels, such as in [[Le Palais]] and [[Port-Louis, Morbihan|Port-Louis]]. In rural areas, Breton houses remained simple, with a single floor and a [[longhouse]] pattern. They were built with local materials: mostly granite in [[Lower Brittany]] and [[schist]] in [[Upper Brittany]]. [[Slate]]s and [[thatching|reeds]] were usually used for roofing. During the 19th century, the Breton architecture was mainly characterised by the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] and [[Eclecticism]]. [[Clisson]], the southernmost Breton town, was rebuilt in an Italian [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style around 1820. The Breton [[lighthouse]]s were mostly built during the 19th century. The most famous are [[Ar Men]], [[Phare d'Eckm\u00fchl]], [[La Vieille]] and [[La Jument]]. The lighthouse on the [[\u00cele Vierge]] is, with 77 meters, the highest in Europe.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, several [[seaside resort]]s were created along the coast and villas and hotels were built in [[historicism (art)|historicist]], [[Art Nouveau]], and later in the [[Art Deco]] styles. These architectures are particularly present in [[Dinard]], [[La Baule]] and [[B\u00e9nodet]]. Architecture from the 20th century can be seen in [[Saint-Nazaire]], [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Lorient]], three cities destroyed during the [[Second World War]] and rebuilt afterwards, and in the works of the Breton nationalist architects like [[James Bouill\u00e9]] and [[Olier Mordrel]].\n\n===Fine arts===\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 078.jpg|thumb|''The Beautiful Ang\u00e8le'' by [[Paul Gauguin]].]]\nUntil the 19th century, [[Catholicism]] had been the main inspiration for Breton artists. The region has a great number of [[baroque]] [[retable]]s, made between the 17th and the 19th century. Breton sculptors were also famous for their ship models that served as [[ex-voto]]s and for their richly decorated furniture, which features na\u00efve Breton characters and traditional patterns. The [[box-bed]] is the most famous Breton piece of furniture. The Breton style had a strong revival between 1900 and the [[Second World War]] and it was used by the [[Seiz Breur]] movement. The Seiz Breur artists also tried to invent a modern Breton art by rejecting French standards and mixing traditional techniques with new materials. The leading artists of that period were the designer [[Ren\u00e9-Yves Creston]], the illustrators [[Jeanne Malivel]] and [[Xavier Haas]], and the sculptors [[Raffig Tullou]], [[Francis Renaud (sculptor)|Francis Renaud]], [[Georges Robin]], [[Joseph Savina]], [[Jules-Charles Le Bozec]] and [[Jean Fr\u00e9our]].\n\nBrittany is also known for its [[needlework]], which can be seen on its numerous headdress models, and for its [[faience]] production, which started at the beginning of the 18th century. [[Quimper faience]] is known worldwide for its bowls and plates painted by hand, and other towns, such as [[Pornic]], also maintain a similar tradition. The potteries usually feature na\u00efve Breton characters in traditional clothing and daily scenes. The designs have a strong traditional Breton influence, but [[Orientalism]] and [[Art Deco]] have also been used.\n\nBecause of its distinct culture and natural landscape, Brittany has inspired many French artists since the 19th century. The [[Pont-Aven School]], which started to emerge in the 1850s and lasted until the beginning of the 20th century, had a decisive influence on modern painting. The artists who settled in [[Pont-Aven]] wanted to break away from the [[Academic art|Academic style]] of the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] and later from [[Impressionism]] when it began to decline. Among them were [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Paul Signac]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Paul S\u00e9rusier]] and [[Raymond Wintz]]. Before them, Brittany had also been visited by Academic and Romantic painters like [[Jean Antoine Th\u00e9odore de Gudin]] and [[Jules Achille No\u00ebl]] who were looking for dramatic seascapes and storms.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Brittany|Breton dance}}\n[[File:Bagad.JPG|thumb|The [[Lann-Bihou\u00e9]] [[bagad]].]]\nSince the early 1970s, Brittany has experienced a tremendous revival of its folk music. Numerous festivals were created, along with smaller ''[[fest noz|fest-noz]]'' (popular feasts). The ''[[bagad]]o\u00f9'', bands composed of [[bagpipe]]s, [[bombard (music)|bombards]] and drums (including [[Snare drum|snare]]), are also a modern creation, inspired by the Scottish [[pipe band]]s. The [[Lann-Bihou\u00e9]] bagad, one of the most well-known, belongs to the [[French Navy]]. It is the only one that does not take part to the annual bagado\u00f9 competitions. [[Celtic harp]] is also common, as are vocals and dances. The [[Kan ha diskan]] is the most common type of singing. The performers sing calls and responses while dancing. Breton dances usually imply circles, chains or couples and they are different in every region. The oldest dances seem to be the [[passepied]] and the [[gavotte]], and the newest ones derive from the [[quadrille]] and [[French Renaissance]] dances.\n\n[[File:Nolwenn Leroy - Alan Stivell.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nolwenn Leroy]] and [[Alan Stivell]] (2012).]]\nIn the 1960s, several Breton artists started to use contemporary patterns to create a Breton pop music. Among them, [[Alan Stivell]] highly contributed to popularise the [[Celtic harp]] and Breton music in the world. He also used [[American rock|American]] [[rock and roll]] in his works and influenced 1970s Breton bands such as [[Kornog]], [[Gwerz]] and [[Tri Yann]], who revived traditional songs and made them popular across France. [[Soldat Louis]] is the main Breton rock band,{{fact|date=March 2019}} and Breton singers include [[Gilles Servat]], [[Glenmor]], [[Dan Ar Braz]], [[Yann-Fa\u00f1ch Kemener]], [[Denez Prigent]], [[Nolwenn Korbell]] and [[Nolwenn Leroy]]. The [[Manau (group)|Manau]] [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] group from Paris has strong Breton and Celtic inspirations.\n\n[[Yann Tiersen]], who composed the soundtrack for ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'', the [[Electro (music)|Electro]] band [[Yelle]] and the [[avant-garde]] singer [[Brigitte Fontaine]] are also from Brittany. The 19th-century composer [[Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray]] was one of the first western European composers to be influenced by what is now known as [[world music]].\n\n===Legends and literature===\n[[File:Botrel.jpg|thumb|The singer-songwriter [[Th\u00e9odore Botrel]] dressed in traditional Breton costume.]]\nBrittany is closely associated with the [[Matter of Britain]] and [[King Arthur]]. According to [[Wace]], [[Broc\u00e9liande]] is located in Brittany and it is nowadays considered to be [[Paimpont forest]]. There, ruins of a castle surrounded by a lake are associated with the [[Lady of the Lake]], a [[dolmen]] is said to be [[Merlin]]'s tomb and a path is presented as [[Morgan le Fay]]'s [[Val sans Retour]]. [[Tristan and Iseult]] are also said to have lived in Brittany. Another major Breton legend is the story about [[Ys]], a city swallowed by the ocean.\n\nBreton literature before the 19th century was mostly oral.  The oral tradition entertained by medieval poets died out during the 15th century and books in [[Breton language|Breton]] were very rare before 1850. At that time, local writers started to collect and publish local tales and legends and wrote original works.  Published between 1925 and the [[Second World War]], the literary journal [[Gwalarn]] favoured a modern Breton literature and helped translating widely known novels into Breton.  After the war, the journal ''Al Liamm'' pursued that mission. Among the authors writing in Breton are [[Auguste Brizeux]], a Romantic poet, the [[neo-Druid]]ic bard [[Erwan Berthou]], [[Th\u00e9odore Claude Henri, vicomte Hersart de la Villemarqu\u00e9|Th\u00e9odore Hersart de La Villemarqu\u00e9]], who collected the local legends about [[King Arthur]], [[Roparz Hemon]], founder of [[Gwalarn]], [[P\u00ear-Jakez Helias]], [[Glenmor]], [[P\u00ear Denez]] and [[Meavenn]].\n\nBreton literature in French includes 19th-century historical novels by [[\u00c9mile Souvestre]], travel journals by [[Anatole Le Braz]], poems and novels by [[Charles Le Goffic]], the works of the singer-songwriter [[Th\u00e9odore Botrel]] and of the maritime writer [[Henri Queff\u00e9lec]]. Brittany is also the birthplace of many French writers like [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Ernest Renan]], [[F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Robert de Lamennais]] and [[Pierre Ab\u00e9lard]] [[Max Jacob]], [[Alfred Jarry]], [[Victor Segalen]], [[Xavier Grall]], [[Jean Rouaud]], [[Ir\u00e8ne Frain]], [[Herve Jaouen]]<ref>Herv\u00e9_Jaouen</ref>, [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]], [[Pierre-Jakez H\u00e9lias]], [[Tristan Corbi\u00e8re]], [[Paul F\u00e9val]], [[Jean Gu\u00e9henno]], [[Arthur Bern\u00e8de]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Patrick Poivre d'Arvor]]\n\nThe ''[[Asterix]]'' comics, set during the time of [[Julius Caesar]] and written in the second half of the twentieth century, are set in Armorica, now Brittany.\n\n===Museums===\nThe Museum of Brittany, located in [[Rennes]], was founded in 1856. Its collections are mainly dedicated to the history of the region. Museums dedicated to [[Prehistory]] and local [[megalith]]s are located in [[Carnac]] and [[Penmarch]], while several towns like [[Vannes]] and [[Nantes]] have a museum presenting their own history.\n\nThe [[Museum of Fine Arts of Rennes]] owns a large collection of Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities as well as drawings and engravings by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] and [[Rembrandt]]. Its French art collection gathers works by [[Georges de La Tour]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Camille Corot]] and [[Robert Delaunay]]. It has also works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Rubens]], [[Peter Lely]] and [[Paolo Veronese]]. The collections of the [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nantes|Museum of Fine Arts of Nantes]] are more dedicated to modern and contemporary art and contain works by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Paul Signac]], [[Tamara de Lempicka]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Pierre Soulages]] and [[Piero Manzoni]]. The Museums of Fine Arts of [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Quimper]] offer similar collections, with large quantities of French painting together with the works of some Italian and Dutch artists. The Museum of Fine Arts [[Pont-Aven]] is dedicated to the [[School of Pont-Aven]]. Contemporary sculptures can be seen in the park around the Ch\u00e2teau de Kergu\u00e9hennec, in [[Bignan]].\n\nMuseums in [[Saint-Malo]], [[Lorient]] and [[Douarnenez]] are dedicated to ships and maritime traditions and history. The [[Mus\u00e9e national de la Marine]] has a large annex in Brest and a submarine is opened to visitors in [[Lorient]]. In the same town, it is also possible to visit the [[Keroman Submarine Base]] built in 1942, and the ''Cit\u00e9 de la voile [[\u00c9ric Tabarly]]'', a museum dedicated to sailing. In [[Saint-Nazaire]], where many [[Ocean liner|transatlantic ships]] where built, including ''[[SS Normandie]]'' and ''[[SS France (1961)|SS France]]'', a museum showing transatlantic interiors was installed in a [[Second World War]] base. Nantes has a [[Jules Verne Museum|museum dedicated to Jules Verne]], a [[Natural History Museum of Nantes|Natural History Museum]] and a museum of archaeology and design, the [[Mus\u00e9e Dobr\u00e9e]].\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:Tonnerres de Brest 2012 - G\u00f6theborg - 003.jpg|thumb|The ''[[G\u00f6theborg (ship)|G\u00f6theborg]]'' ship replica at the Brest tall ship meeting in 2012.]]\nBrittany has a vibrant calendar of festivals and events. It hosts some of France's biggest contemporary music festivals, such as [[La Route du Rock]] in [[Saint-Malo]], the [[Vieilles Charrues Festival|Vieilles Charrues]] in [[Carhaix]], the [[Rencontres Trans Musicales]] in [[Rennes]], the Festival du Bout du Monde in [[Crozon]], the [[Hellfest (French music festival)|Hellfest]] in [[Clisson]] and the Astropolis in Brest. The [[Festival Interceltique de Lorient]] welcomes each year participants all the [[Celtic nations]] and their diasporas. [[La Folle Journ\u00e9e]], in [[Nantes]], is the largest classical music festival in France.\n\nThe Breton culture is highlighted during the ''F\u00eate de la Bretagne'', which occurs in many places around Saint-Yves's day (19 May), and during the Festival de Cornouaille in [[Quimper]]. Several towns also organise [[historical re-enactment]]s and events celebrating local traditions, such as the Filets Bleus in [[Concarneau]] which celebrates fishing.\n\nBrittany also has some film festivals like the [[Three Continents Festival]] in [[Nantes]]. The [[Utopiales]] international science fiction festival is held in the same city. Brest and [[Douarnenez]] both organise large [[tall ship]] meetings.\n\n===Sport===\n[[Association football|Football]], cycling and sailing are the three most popular sports in Brittany. Major football teams are the [[FC Nantes]], the [[Stade Rennais F.C.]], the [[FC Lorient]], the [[Stade Brestois 29]], the [[Vannes OC]] and the [[En Avant de Guingamp]]. Professional footballers coming from the region also form the [[Brittany national football team]] which sometimes plays with national teams.\n\nSeveral Bretons have won the [[Tour de France]]: [[Bernard Hinault]], [[Louison Bobet]], [[Jean Robic]] and [[Lucien Petit-Breton]] as riders, and [[Cyrille Guimard]] as a ''[[directeur sportif]]''.\n\nSailing is particularly important for sea-resorts like [[La Trinit\u00e9-sur-Mer]], [[Pornichet]], [[Concarneau]], [[Lorient]] and the [[\u00eeles de Gl\u00e9nan]], where a prestigious school is located. A great number of Bretons have become acclaimed sailors, such as: [[\u00c9ric Tabarly]], [[Lo\u00efck Peyron]], [[Jean Le Cam]], [[Michel Desjoyeaux]], [[Olivier de Kersauson]], [[Thomas Coville]], [[Vincent Riou]] and [[Marc Pajot]]. The [[Route du Rhum]], the [[Transat Qu\u00e9bec-Saint-Malo]], the [[Jules Verne Trophy]] are the main Breton sailing competitions. The [[Solitaire du Figaro]] stages often start in Brittany.\n\n[[Gouren]], a style of [[folk wrestling]], is the most popular Breton sport. The [[Boule bretonne]] is related to [[p\u00e9tanque]]. The ''Palets'', common in [[Upper Brittany]] and in other French regions, is also related to p\u00e9tanque, but players use iron disks instead of balls and they have to throw them on a wooden board.\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Galette \u0153uf saucisse.JPG|thumb|[[Galette]]s served with eggs and sausages.]]\nAlthough [[Muscadet]] and Gros Plant white wines are produced south of the [[Loire River|Loire]], the traditional drink of Brittany is [[cider]]. Brittany is the second-largest cider-producing region in France.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaoueg.bzh/le-cidre |title=Le Cidre&nbsp;\u2013 Mediaoueg , Ar Vediaoueg&nbsp;\u2013 La M\u00e9diath\u00e8que |publisher=Mediaoueg.bzh |date= |accessdate=3 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910212009/http://www.mediaoueg.bzh/le-cidre/ |archive-date=10 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Breton cider is traditionally served in a bowl or a cup. Brittany also has a long beer-brewing tradition, tracing its roots back to the 17th century. Young artisanal brewers are keeping a variety of beer types alive,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bierbreizh.info/ |title=bierbreizh&nbsp;\u2013 Accueil |publisher=Bierbreizh.info |date= |accessdate=3 May 2011}}</ref> such as ''Coreff de Morlaix'', ''Tri Martolod'' and ''Britt''. Stronger alcohols include the ''[[chouchen]]'', a sort of [[mead]] made with wild honey, and an apple [[eau de vie]] called ''lambig''.\n\n[[Cr\u00eape]]s and [[galette]]s are the two most well-known Breton dishes. The cr\u00eapes, made and served with butter, are eaten for dessert and the galettes are usually salty and made with [[buckwheat]]. They traditionally replaced bread as basic food and they can be served with cheese, sausages, bacon, mushrooms or eggs. They can be accompanied by Breton [[buttermilk]] called ''lait ribot''. Brittany also has a dish similar to the [[pot-au-feu]] known as the [[kig ha farz]], which consists of stewed pork or beef with [[buckwheat]] dumplings.\n\nSurrounded by the sea, Brittany offers a wide range of fresh seafood and fish, especially [[mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s. Among the seafood specialities is a fish stew called [[cotriade]]. The [[beurre blanc]] sauce, invented in [[Saint-Julien-de-Concelles]], close to [[Nantes]], is often served with fish. Brittany is also known for its salt, mainly harvested around [[Gu\u00e9rande]] and used in butter and milk caramels. The region is notable for its biscuit factories, many towns having their own: [[Quimper]], [[Lorient]], [[Pont-Aven]], [[Saint-Brieuc]], BN and [[Lef\u00e8vre-Utile|LU]] in [[Nantes]], La Trinitaine in [[La Trinit\u00e9-sur-Mer]], and Galettes Saint-Michel in [[Saint-Michel-Chef-Chef]]. They usually make their biscuits with salted butter and sell them in iron boxes. Famous Breton [[pastry|pastries]] include the ''[[kouign amann]]'' (\"butter cake\" in Breton) made with bread dough and high quantities of butter and sugar, and the  ''[[far Breton|far]]'', a sort of sweet [[Yorkshire pudding]] usually made with plums.\n\n==Transport==\n\n=== Road ===\n[[File:Borne N786.jpg|thumb|An old road sign on the Route Nationale 786 in [[Tr\u00e9veneuc]].]]\nUntil the 1970s, the Breton road network was poor because maritime and rail transport prevailed.

It also provides a link to southern [[Normandy]], terminating in Paris. In south Brittany the [[Route nationale 165]] performs a similar role along the south coast providing connections between [[Nantes]], [[Vannes]], [[Lorient]], [[Quimper]] and [[Brest, France|Brest]]. The Route nationale 164 crosses the centre of the peninsula and connects [[Rennes]] to [[Loud\u00e9ac]], [[Morlaix]] and [[Ch\u00e2teaulin]], and the Route nationale 166 links [[Rennes]] to [[Vannes]]. The Route nationale 137 provides connections between [[Saint-Malo]], [[Rennes]] and [[Nantes]] and terminates in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n[[Nantes]] is linked to Paris by the [[A11 autoroute]], and [[Rennes]] is both on the [[A81 autoroute]] to Paris and the [[A84 autoroute]] to [[Caen]]. These highways are standard French [[toll road]].\n\n=== Air ===\n[[File:Morlaix-Viaduc-1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Morlaix]] railway viaduct is one of the highest in France.]]\nThe biggest Breton airport is [[Nantes Atlantique Airport]]. Destination served include the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Morocco. It will be replaced around 2017 by the new [[A\u00e9roport du Grand Ouest]], located 30&nbsp;km to the north-west of Nantes. The [[Brest Bretagne Airport]] is the second airport in Brittany. It is followed by [[Rennes - Saint-Jacques Airport|Rennes \u2013 Saint-Jacques]], [[Lorient South Brittany Airport|Lorient South Brittany]] and [[Dinard - Pleurtuit - Saint-Malo Airport|Dinard \u2013 Saint-Malo]]. The [[Saint-Brieuc - Armor Airport|Saint-Brieuc \u2013 Armor]] airport serves flights between Brittany and the [[Channel Islands]]. Others smaller airport operates domestic flights in [[Quimper - Cornouaille Airport|Quimper]], and [[Lannion - C\u00f4te de Granit Airport|Lannion]].\n\n=== Rail ===\n[[File:Ms Bretagne.jpg|thumb|The [[Brittany Ferries]] ''MS Bretagne'' off Saint-Malo.]]\nBrittany is on two major [[TGV]] lines, one linking Paris to [[Nantes]] and [[Le Croisic]], on the south coast, and another linking Paris to [[Rennes]] and [[Brest, France|Brest]]. The [[LGV Atlantique]] which stops at Le Mans will be extended to Rennes in 2017, providing faster connections between Paris and Brittany. TGV train services also link the region with cities such as [[Lyon]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Marseille]], and [[Lille]]. Secondary train services are operated by [[TER Bretagne]] which provides connections between small towns such as [[Vannes]], [[Carhaix]], [[Roscoff]] and [[Paimpol]]. TER Bretagne also manages coach lines and connections between Rennes and Nantes. [[TER Pays de la Loire]] operates trains between Nantes and smaller towns in [[Loire-Atlantique]].\n\n=== Sea ===\nThere are ferry services that take passengers, vehicles and freight to Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands. The main companies are [[Brittany Ferries]] which operates lines between [[Plymouth]] and [[Roscoff]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Saint-Malo]], and [[Roscoff]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. [[Irish Ferries]] operates the route [[Rosslare Europort|Rosslare]]-[[Roscoff]] and [[Condor Ferries]] link [[Saint-Malo]] with [[Jersey]].\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCycling has always been one of the main sports of Brittany, but leisure cycling and the infrastructure to support it have been growing extremely rapidly. An extensive network of cycle paths and recommended cycle routes has opened up all over the region. Some of these are routes using mainly smaller roads and both signposted and maintained by communes individually, but many are based on dedicated cycle paths often formed by converting disused railway tracks. These help form routes such as 'V\u00e9lodyss\u00e9e' from Roscoff to Nantes and several major routes under the 'V' label (following signs V1, V2 etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://velo.tourismebretagne.com/|title=La Bretagne \u00e0 v\u00e9lo : Pr\u00e8s de 1500 km d\u2019itin\u00e9raires v\u00e9los !|website=velo.tourismebretagne.com|accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref> The old tow-path of the Nantes-Brest canal is now open to cyclists along its entire 385&nbsp;km length though in places (unlike rail-based cycle paths) it is very meandering and leaving the path will both shorten the distance and provide variety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bretonbikes.com/cycling-holidays-FAQ.html#canal|title=Cycling holidays in france FAQ page for all your questions|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a general rule cyclists are very well respected in the region and many larger towns have cycle-lanes \u2013 however traffic is 'cycle-friendly' even in their absence.\n\n== Symbols ==\n[[File:Drapeau Bretagne.jpg|thumb|The modern flag of Brittany.]]\nThe modern [[flag of Brittany]] was designed in 1923. It is called ''Gwenn ha Du'' (\"white and black\" in [[Breton language|Breton]]) and it features eleven [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] spots (their number may vary) and nine stripes, the black ones represent the Breton speaking historical dioceses, and the white ones symbolise the [[gallo language|gallo]] speaking dioceses. The flag was created to replace the traditional ermine plain standard, considered too aristocratic and royalist. It was inspired by the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] and the British [[Red Ensign]].<ref>[[Francis Favereau]], ''Bretagne contemporaine \u2013 Culture, langue, identit\u00e9''? page 210, Skol Vreizh, Morlaix, 2005, {{ISBN|2-911447-72-7}}.</ref> Since the 1920s, the flag has become very popular and it is flown from a large number of institutions. Apart from the ermine flag, Breton historic banners include the [[Kroaz Du]], a white flag with a black cross, the perfect negative of the [[St Piran's Flag|Cornish flag]].\n\n[[File:Hermine passante collet\u00e9e.svg|left|thumb|The ermine was the [[heraldic badge|badge]] of several dukes of Brittany.]]\nThe coat of arms of Brittany, ''ermine plain'', was adopted by [[John III, Duke of Brittany|John III]] in 1316. Ermine had been used in Brittany long before, and there is no clue about its origin. It was probably chosen by the dukes because of its similarity with the French [[fleur-de-lis]]. The [[ermine]], or stoat, as an animal became the [[heraldic badge|badge]] of [[John IV, Duke of Brittany|John IV]] at the end of the 14th century. It appeared later on numerous locations, including churches and castles. According to popular traditions, [[Anne of Brittany]] was hunting with her court when she saw a white ermine who preferred to die than to cross a dirty marsh. This episode would have inspired the duchess' motto : ''\"Potius mori quam foedari\"'' (\"rather death than dishonour\").<ref>Gwenc'hlan Le Scou\u00ebzec, ''Guide de la Bretagne'', page 40, Coop Breizh, Sp\u00e9zet, 1987; and ''Le Journal de la Bretagne des origines \u00e0 nos jours'', page 106, Larousse, Paris, 2001</ref> The motto has later been reused by Breton regiments, local [[Resistance during World War II|World War II Resistants]] and cultural movements.\n\nThe Breton anthem, although not official, is ''[[Bro Gozh ma Zado\u00f9]]'' \u2013 (\"Old Land of My Fathers\"). It re-employs both the [[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau|Welsh anthem]]'s music and that of \"Bro Goth agan Tasow\" (the national anthem of Cornwall; its lyrics were written at the end of the 19th century).\n\nColloquial Breton emblems include the Celtic [[triskelion]], the [[menhir]]s and [[dolmen]]s, local dishes such as the [[galette]]s, the [[Bigouden]] headdress and the traditional black round hat, the fisherman and his yellow raincoat, etc. ''BZH'' is a common abbreviation for \"Breizh\" (\"Brittany\" in Breton) and people often put BZH stickers on their car-plates, although it is forbidden under French laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&dateJO=19670707&numTexte=&pageDebut=06810&pageFin=|title=Fac-simil\u00e9 JO du 07/07/1967, page 06810 \u2013 Legifrance|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> ''[[.bzh]]'' is an approved Internet [[top level domain]] for the [[Breton people|Breton]] culture and languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domainesinfo.fr/english/136/brittany-s-bzh-the-next-regional-domain.php|title=The domain www.domainesinfo.fr is registered by NetNames|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings|title=Delegated Strings \u2013 ICANN New gTLDs|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"\" widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Tombeau Merlin Broc\u00e9liande195.JPG|[[Merlin]]'s tomb in the [[Broc\u00e9liande]] forest, [[Paimpont forest|Paimpont]]\nFile:Crucuno dolmen.jpg|A dolmen in [[Plouharnel]]\nFile:Guerande Tor.jpg|The city wall of [[Gu\u00e9rande]]\nFile:Tour-qui-qu-en-grogne-DS62.jpg|Castle of [[Saint-Malo]], ''Qui Qu'en Grogne'' Tower\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau Suscinio.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Suscinio]]\nFile:Phare IleVerge PM.jpg|[[\u00cele Vierge]] lighthouse\nFile:Parlement de Bretagne-2006.jpg|Parlement of Brittany in [[Rennes]]\nFile:Abbacy and lighthouse of Saint-Mathieu.jpg|Abbey and lighthouse of [[Pointe Saint-Mathieu|Saint-Mathieu]]\nFile:20 Moulin vert.JPG|''Ar Meilho\u00f9 Glaz'', a [[Bagad]] from [[Quimper]]\nFile:PLcdm 2009 S 028.JPG|''Festival du chant de marin'', sea songs festival in [[Paimpol]]\nFile:Batz-sur-Mer Coiffe.jpg|A Breton headdress from [[Batz-sur-Mer]]\nFile:W.

The population was 6,362 at the 2010 census, up from 5,891 at the 2000 [[census]]. It is situated at the most northwestern point of the [[San Gorgonio Pass]]\n\nThe area was planted with many cherry trees, for which Cherry Valley was named. While many of the trees have long since been removed and replaced with homes, a few can still be spotted in backyards throughout the area.\n\n==History==\nIn the early 1800s, the area was known as the San Gorgonio Rancho, an outpost for the [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel|San Gabriel Mission]]. A large portion of the area was a Spanish Land Grant made to a man by the name of Paulino Weaver.\u00a0In 1853, Weaver sold some of his land to Dr. Isaac William Smith, who was struck by the land's natural beauty while looking for stray cattle. Dr. Smith purchased a 1,000 acres for $1,000 from Weaver and established Smith Ranch and [https://www.hsresort.com/history.html Highland Springs Ranch & Inn].\u00a0The original Smith residence stood near where the swimming pool is today. In 1862, Smith's ranch was dubbed \"Smith Station\" and was made a stagecoach stop.\u00a0In 1865, a young Wyatt Earp drove the route from San Bernardino to La Paz, Arizona on which Smith Station was a popular stop.\n\nFrom 1864 to 1866, the route through Highland Springs along the Bradshaw Trail was the single connecting line for passenger, mail and the express travel between Southern California and the eastern regions of the nation.\u00a0Smith's Station slowly developed into a hotel bustling with traffic.\u00a0In 1884, the Smith property was purchased by a Los Angeles company that built a three-story hotel on the property called Highland Home.\u00a0The first cherry trees in the area were planted here, contributing to the name that it is still known by today.\n\nIn 1927, Fred and William Hirsch bought the old Smith place, renamed it Highland Springs Resort, and developed it into a health resort.\u00a0Fred Hirsch himself was made healthy through following the philosophy of Professor Arnold Ehret, who was an early proponent of juice fasting and colon cleansing. The restaurant on the resort was vegetarian and Hirsch grew a lot of the produce served at the restaurant on the property.\u00a0He also grew his own grapes and operated a small vineyard. The resort became known as \"The Last Resort\" as many sick people who were not able to get well with traditional methods, were able to recover through Hirsch's health practices while staying at the resort.\n\n==Geography==\nCherry Valley is located at {{coord|33|58|29|N|116|58|13|W|type:city}} (33.974848, -116.970300).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nWith an elevation of 2,980 feet above sea level, Cherry Valley is at the highest point on the San Gorgonio Pass between [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]].\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|8.1|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] system, Cherry Valley has a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]], abbreviated \"Csa\" on climate maps.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=706040&cityname=Cherry+Valley%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Cherry Valley, California]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0612916|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715024047/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0612916|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Cherry Valley CDP|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Cherry Valley had a population of 6,362.

While many of the trees have long since been removed and replaced with homes, a few can still be spotted in backyards throughout the area.\n\n==History==\nIn the early 1800s, the area was known as the San Gorgonio Rancho, an outpost for the [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel|San Gabriel Mission]]. A large portion of the area was a Spanish Land Grant made to a man by the name of Paulino Weaver.\u00a0In 1853, Weaver sold some of his land to Dr. Isaac William Smith, who was struck by the land's natural beauty while looking for stray cattle. Dr. Smith purchased a 1,000 acres for $1,000 from Weaver and established Smith Ranch and [https://www.hsresort.com/history.html Highland Springs Ranch & Inn].\u00a0The original Smith residence stood near where the swimming pool is today. In 1862, Smith's ranch was dubbed \"Smith Station\" and was made a stagecoach stop.\u00a0In 1865, a young Wyatt Earp drove the route from San Bernardino to La Paz, Arizona on which Smith Station was a popular stop.\n\nFrom 1864 to 1866, the route through Highland Springs along the Bradshaw Trail was the single connecting line for passenger, mail and the express travel between Southern California and the eastern regions of the nation.\u00a0Smith's Station slowly developed into a hotel bustling with traffic.\u00a0In 1884, the Smith property was purchased by a Los Angeles company that built a three-story hotel on the property called Highland Home.\u00a0The first cherry trees in the area were planted here, contributing to the name that it is still known by today.\n\nIn 1927, Fred and William Hirsch bought the old Smith place, renamed it Highland Springs Resort, and developed it into a health resort.\u00a0Fred Hirsch himself was made healthy through following the philosophy of Professor Arnold Ehret, who was an early proponent of juice fasting and colon cleansing.

Kr\u00fcger was born and grew up with his brother Gotthard de Beauclair in the artists' colony on [[Monte Verit\u00e0]]. In 1920 his mother moved with the two children to [[Darmstadt]] , where the family came from. From 1921 to 1930 he went to school in Darmstadt.\n\nIn 1930 de Beauclair began studying general mechanical engineering at the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]]. After completing his studies, he was initially taken on as a research assistant and then as an assistant at the Institute for Practical Mathematics (IPM), headed by [[Alwin Walther]]. There he was involved in the construction of an automatic calculator with punched tape programming, which was destroyed during the bombing of Darmstadt like the entire IPM. He also worked on the development of devices for Fourier analysis . From 1939 he developed together with Hans-Joachim Dreyer, both from IPM to the company OTT in [[Kempten]], a new type of electromechanical cutting wheel integration system to solve differential equations, the DGM-IPM-Ott, of which there are still assemblies in the inventory of the German Museum Munich.\n\nIn 1942 he met [[Konrad Zuse]] in Berlin, who showed him the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3 computer system]]. As head of the precision engineering workshop at the IPM, de Beauclair subsequently supported Zuse with the work on the [[Z4 (computer)|Z4]] Among other things, the IPM supplied punching devices for punched tape that were used to control the program sequence and to save intermediate results. Zuse and de Beauclair became friends. In January 1945, de Beauclair became Dr.-Ing. With Alwin Walther at the TU Darmstadt with a thesis on multidimensional Fourier synthesis doctorate.\n\nIn April 1945, like many other men, he was interned by the French military for no reason, and brought to [[Alsace]] while traveling to the Allg\u00e4u . In December 1945, his civilian status was recognized and de Beauclair released from internment. However, he was seriously ill with tuberculosis, was unable to work and had to be hospitalized from 1946 to 1950.<ref name=\"HO\" /> In 1949 his doctoral thesis was published.\n\nAfter being released from the hospital, the family moved to [[Stuttgart]] in late 1950 . Initially de Beauclair worked for the [[G\u00f6ttingen]] company PHYWE in sales, then from 1955 as a development engineer and laboratory manager at SEL, where Dr.-Ing. Dreyer was active. There he was involved in the development of the ER 56 electronic computer and suitable peripheral devices. After the SEL Informatik plant was closed in 1960, he moved to the German Bundespost, where he worked as head of the computerization department at the Central Post Office in Darmstadtthe postal check and savings bank services worked and was there in particular responsible for programming the IT systems. He led the project for microfilming receipts in the course of automatic receipt reading. Due to the microfilming, the documents should also be available in the EDP after processing and should therefore remain legally valid. In addition, the banks tried to save storage space in the early 1960s. Microfilming was a key project for the success of bank automation.\n\nIn 1968 his book, Calculating with Machines, a visual history of computing technology from its origins to 1964, was published by the FAZ, then reviewed and reprinted in 2005 by Springer-Verlag.<ref name=\"HO\" /> In 1977 he retired at the age of 65 as Chief Post Office Director.<ref name=\"AUG\" />\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn May 2002, he was awarded the Prochorov Order of the International Informatization Academy (Moscow) at the Deutsches Museum in Munich.
