After arriving at [[Jakku]] to retrieve a map containing the coordinates where [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) is to be found, Ren kills an old priest named Lor San Tekka ([[Max von Sydow]]), and captures Resistance pilot [[Poe Dameron]] ([[Oscar Isaac]]), who has also been sent to recover the map by General [[Princess Leia|Princess Leia Organa]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]). Ren soon learns that the pilot had entrusted his [[astromech droid]], [[BB-8]], with the map. Poe flees with the help of rogue stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]] ([[John Boyega]]), who later finds BB-8, and the scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]). Finn, Rey, and BB-8 escape Jakku in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', and are soon intercepted by the ship's former owner, [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), and his co-pilot [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]).\n\nIt is revealed that Ren is the son of Han and Leia, originally named Ben,<ref>{{cite web|last=Dennis|first=Catrina|title=Legacy of My Mother: 5 Women Who Changed the ''Star Wars'' Galaxy|date=May 6, 2016|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/legacy-of-my-mother-5-women-who-changed-the-star-wars-galaxy|website=StarWars.com|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref> and was once one of Luke's [[Jedi]] pupils. He was corrupted to the [[dark side (Star Wars)|dark side]] of [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]] by the First Order's [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] ([[Andy Serkis]]), and helped destroy Luke's new Jedi Academy. However, Ren still feels the pull of the light side of the Force and seeks the strength to overcome it from his grandfather [[Darth Vader]], whose burnt helmet is in Ren's possession. Arriving at [[Maz Kanata]]'s ([[Lupita Nyong'o]]) castle on [[Takodana]], Ren captures Rey, who he senses has seen the map. While interrogating her, he realizes that she is strong with the Force, though unaware of it. Rey finds herself able to resist his powers and experience Ren's emotions, and confronts him over his fear that he will never be as powerful as his grandfather. She later uses the \"[[Jedi mind trick]]\" to compel her stormtrooper guard to let her escape. Han arrives at the First Order's superweapon, [[Starkiller Base]], as part of the Resistance's plan to destroy it.\n\nAfter Han plants explosives to destroy the base, he confronts Ren\u2014calling him by his real name, Ben\u2014and implores him to abandon the dark side, warning him that Snoke will kill him once he has control of the galaxy. Ren tells Han he feels conflicted, and asks his father for help, which Han promises to give; Ren then ignites his lightsaber, impaling and killing Han. An enraged Chewbacca fires at Ren, wounding him. As Finn and Rey flee the damaged base, Ren follows and confronts them. Finn fights Ren with [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s recovered lightsaber, but Ren overpowers and severely wounds him. Rey then takes up the lightsaber and, using the Force, begins to overcome Ren, striking him on the face with the lightsaber. Before the duel is finished, they are separated by a seismic fissure created by the collapsing base. Rey and the others escape as Snoke orders [[General Hux]] ([[Domnhall Gleeson]]) to evacuate the base and bring Ren to him to complete his training.\n\n====''The Last Jedi'' (2017)====\n{{main|Star Wars: The Last Jedi}}\nRen's inner conflict continues into ''The Last Jedi'', particularly through his conversations with Rey, with whom he connects through the Force. Rey learns from Luke why Ben Solo turned to the dark side: Luke had seen a vision of the destruction Ben would cause and was briefly tempted to kill him in his sleep; when Ben awoke to see Luke with his lightsaber drawn, he turned on his uncle and destroyed the Jedi Temple. Rey believes that there is still good in Ren, and resolves to bring him back to the light side.\n\nMeanwhile, Ren is reproached by Snoke for his failure to defeat Rey, and Ren tries to prove himself by leading an attack on a lead Resistance starship. He hesitates to destroy it after sensing his mother's presence, but his wingmen destroy the ship's bridge, almost killing Leia. Upon Rey's arrival, Ren captures her and brings her to Snoke, who tortures her for Luke's location before ordering Ren to kill her. Instead of complying, Ren uses the Force to ignite Luke's lightsaber at Snoke's side and cut him in half, and subsequently slays Snoke's royal guard with Rey's assistance. After the guards are slain, Ren reveals to Rey his goal to create a new order in the galaxy, separate from the legacies created by Snoke and Luke, and beseeches Rey to join him. He forces her to acknowledge that her parents abandoned her, and tells her that he is the only one who truly cares about her. Rey refuses to join him, realizing that Ren will not turn back to the light side; the two briefly struggle over Anakin's lightsaber with the Force, resulting in the weapon breaking in half and knocking both warriors unconscious.\n\nAfter Rey escapes, Ren frames her for Snoke's assassination, uses the Force to choke Hux until he acknowledging Ren as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, and orders his forces to attack the Resistance base on Crait. When Luke appears during the attack, Ren orders his men to fire on him, to no effect; Luke remains standing, revealing that he is only present as a Force projection, serving as a distraction to allow the Resistance to escape from the First Order. After Luke vanishes, the First Order storms the base, but the Resistance has already evacuated. Ren shares a final look with Rey through the Force before Rey slams the door to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and escapes with the Resistance.\n\n====''The Rise of Skywalker'' (2019)====\n{{main|Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker}}\nIn ''The Rise of Skywalker'', Ren has been ruling as the Supreme Leader of the First Order for a year. In the film's beginning, Ren searches for a Sith wayfinder to lead him to the Sith planet [[Exegol]], with the hopes of killing the resurrected [[Emperor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) as a show of his power. When Ren finds the wayfinder and arrives on Exegol, Palpatine reveals that he has been manipulating Ren and the First Order, having created Snoke as a means of turning Ren to the dark side. Palpatine unveils the Final Order, a massive armada of planet-killing Star Destroyers. Palpatine offers the armada to Ren in a bid to form a new Empire\u2014with Ren as Emperor\u2014on the condition that he kill Rey.\n\nRen searches the galaxy for Rey and continues corresponding with her through the Force to discern her location. Rey has been searching for a second wayfinder; Ren tries to stop her from finding it. Eventually, Ren informs Rey that she is Palpatine's granddaughter, and furthermore, they are a dyad in the Force with extremely powerful potential when joined together. He urges her once more to take his hand, and to overthrow Palpatine together. Rey refuses, but Ren is unwilling to kill her and follows her to [[Kef Bir]], the location of the second wayfinder. Meeting her on the wreckage of the [[second Death Star]], Ren destroys Rey's wayfinder and duels her. The duel ends with Rey impaling Ren, who had been distracted by his dying mother, Leia, reaching out to him through the Force. A guilt-ridden Rey uses the Force to heal Ren and leaves aboard his ship, after telling him that she wanted to take Ben Solo's hand, but not Kylo Ren's. Alone on the wreckage, Ren converses with a memory of his father, Han Solo; he throws away his lightsaber, renouncing his role as Supreme Leader and reclaiming his old identity of Ben Solo.\n\nBen rushes to help Rey defeat Palpatine on Exegol. Rey senses his presence and uses their Force connection to give him Anakin's lightsaber, which Ben uses to defeat the Knights of Ren. Palpatine then senses Rey and Ben's connection as a dyad of the Force, and absorbs their energy to restore his full power, before casting Ben into an abyss. However, Rey manages to defeat and kill Palpatine before dying from the effort. Ben climbs out of the abyss and finds Rey's inert body. Ben manages to transfer all of his life essence into her, successfully resuscitating her but sacrificing his own life in the process. They share a passionate kiss before Ben dies peacefully in Rey's arms. His body fades away simultaneously with his mother's, becoming one with the Force.\n\n===Related works and promotional material===\nKylo is a playable character in the 2015 ''The Force Awakens'' add-on to the ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'' video game, with an ''Infinity'' character figurine available separately.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2015/10/12/the-force-awakens-kylo-ren-poe-dameron/ |title=''Disney Infinity: The Force Awakens'' Dated, Adds Kylo Ren And Poe Dameron |work=Forbes |first=Andy |last=Robertson |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/12/09/disney-infinitys-star-wars-the-force-awakens-lets-john-boyega-play-with-himself/ |title=Disney Infinity's ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' lets John Boyega play with himself |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |first=Giancarlo |last=Valdes |date=December 9, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-force-awakens-play-set-for-disney-infinity-3-0-edition-now-available |title=''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' Play Set for ''Disney Infinity 3.0'' Edition Now Available |publisher=StarWars.com |date=December 18, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2015/12/16/disney-infinity-star-wars-the-force-awakens-game/77412314/ |title=''Infinity'' adds to ''Force Awakens'' experience |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Brian |last=Truitt |date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref> He is also a character in the [[strategy video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Force Arena]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Compendio|first1=Chris|title=Kylo Ren and Rey Finally Join Mobile Game ''Star Wars: Force Arena''|url=https://screenrant.com/kylo-ren-rey-star-wars-force-arena/|publisher=Screen Rant|date=November 9, 2017|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Hasbro]] has released a {{convert|3+3/4|in|cm|adj=on}} Kylo Ren action figure,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blastr.com/2015-8-14/leaked-peek-hasbros-kylo-ren-captain-phasma-and-10-more-force-awakens-action-figures |title=Leaked peek at Hasbro's Kylo Ren, Captain Phasma and 10 more ''The Force Awakens'' action figures |publisher=[[Blastr]] |first=Jeff |last=Spry |date=August 14, 2015 |accessdate=January 3, 2016}}</ref> and a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} figure in their Black Series line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rebelscum.com/03-Kylo-Ren-The-Black-Series-Star-Wars-Hasbro-2015.asp |title=03 Kylo Ren from Hasbro's The Black Series |publisher=Rebelscum.com |first=D.

After arriving at [[Jakku]] to retrieve a map containing the coordinates where [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) is to be found, Ren kills an old priest named Lor San Tekka ([[Max von Sydow]]), and captures Resistance pilot [[Poe Dameron]] ([[Oscar Isaac]]), who has also been sent to recover the map by General [[Princess Leia|Princess Leia Organa]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]). Ren soon learns that the pilot had entrusted his [[astromech droid]], [[BB-8]], with the map. Poe flees with the help of rogue stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]] ([[John Boyega]]), who later finds BB-8, and the scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]). Finn, Rey, and BB-8 escape Jakku in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', and are soon intercepted by the ship's former owner, [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), and his co-pilot [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]).\n\nIt is revealed that Ren is the son of Han and Leia, originally named Ben,<ref>{{cite web|last=Dennis|first=Catrina|title=Legacy of My Mother: 5 Women Who Changed the ''Star Wars'' Galaxy|date=May 6, 2016|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/legacy-of-my-mother-5-women-who-changed-the-star-wars-galaxy|website=StarWars.com|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref> and was once one of Luke's [[Jedi]] pupils. He was corrupted to the [[dark side (Star Wars)|dark side]] of [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]] by the First Order's [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] ([[Andy Serkis]]), and helped destroy Luke's new Jedi Academy. However, Ren still feels the pull of the light side of the Force and seeks the strength to overcome it from his grandfather [[Darth Vader]], whose burnt helmet is in Ren's possession. Arriving at [[Maz Kanata]]'s ([[Lupita Nyong'o]]) castle on [[Takodana]], Ren captures Rey, who he senses has seen the map. While interrogating her, he realizes that she is strong with the Force, though unaware of it. Rey finds herself able to resist his powers and experience Ren's emotions, and confronts him over his fear that he will never be as powerful as his grandfather. She later uses the \"[[Jedi mind trick]]\" to compel her stormtrooper guard to let her escape. Han arrives at the First Order's superweapon, [[Starkiller Base]], as part of the Resistance's plan to destroy it.\n\nAfter Han plants explosives to destroy the base, he confronts Ren\u2014calling him by his real name, Ben\u2014and implores him to abandon the dark side, warning him that Snoke will kill him once he has control of the galaxy. Ren tells Han he feels conflicted, and asks his father for help, which Han promises to give; Ren then ignites his lightsaber, impaling and killing Han. An enraged Chewbacca fires at Ren, wounding him. As Finn and Rey flee the damaged base, Ren follows and confronts them. Finn fights Ren with [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s recovered lightsaber, but Ren overpowers and severely wounds him. Rey then takes up the lightsaber and, using the Force, begins to overcome Ren, striking him on the face with the lightsaber. Before the duel is finished, they are separated by a seismic fissure created by the collapsing base. Rey and the others escape as Snoke orders [[General Hux]] ([[Domnhall Gleeson]]) to evacuate the base and bring Ren to him to complete his training.\n\n====''The Last Jedi'' (2017)====\n{{main|Star Wars: The Last Jedi}}\nRen's inner conflict continues into ''The Last Jedi'', particularly through his conversations with Rey, with whom he connects through the Force. Rey learns from Luke why Ben Solo turned to the dark side: Luke had seen a vision of the destruction Ben would cause and was briefly tempted to kill him in his sleep; when Ben awoke to see Luke with his lightsaber drawn, he turned on his uncle and destroyed the Jedi Temple. Rey believes that there is still good in Ren, and resolves to bring him back to the light side.\n\nMeanwhile, Ren is reproached by Snoke for his failure to defeat Rey, and Ren tries to prove himself by leading an attack on a lead Resistance starship. He hesitates to destroy it after sensing his mother's presence, but his wingmen destroy the ship's bridge, almost killing Leia. Upon Rey's arrival, Ren captures her and brings her to Snoke, who tortures her for Luke's location before ordering Ren to kill her. Instead of complying, Ren uses the Force to ignite Luke's lightsaber at Snoke's side and cut him in half, and subsequently slays Snoke's royal guard with Rey's assistance. After the guards are slain, Ren reveals to Rey his goal to create a new order in the galaxy, separate from the legacies created by Snoke and Luke, and beseeches Rey to join him. He forces her to acknowledge that her parents abandoned her, and tells her that he is the only one who truly cares about her. Rey refuses to join him, realizing that Ren will not turn back to the light side; the two briefly struggle over Anakin's lightsaber with the Force, resulting in the weapon breaking in half and knocking both warriors unconscious.\n\nAfter Rey escapes, Ren frames her for Snoke's assassination, uses the Force to choke Hux until he acknowledging Ren as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, and orders his forces to attack the Resistance base on Crait. When Luke appears during the attack, Ren orders his men to fire on him, to no effect; Luke remains standing, revealing that he is only present as a Force projection, serving as a distraction to allow the Resistance to escape from the First Order. After Luke vanishes, the First Order storms the base, but the Resistance has already evacuated. Ren shares a final look with Rey through the Force before Rey slams the door to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and escapes with the Resistance.\n\n====''The Rise of Skywalker'' (2019)====\n{{main|Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker}}\nIn ''The Rise of Skywalker'', Ren has been ruling as the Supreme Leader of the First Order for a year. In the film's beginning, Ren searches for a Sith wayfinder to lead him to the Sith planet [[Exegol]], with the hopes of killing the resurrected [[Emperor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) as a show of his power. When Ren finds the wayfinder and arrives on Exegol, Palpatine reveals that he has been manipulating Ren and the First Order, having created Snoke as a means of turning Ren to the dark side. Palpatine unveils the Final Order, a massive armada of planet-killing Star Destroyers. Palpatine offers the armada to Ren in a bid to form a new Empire\u2014with Ren as Emperor\u2014on the condition that he kill Rey.\n\nRen searches the galaxy for Rey and continues corresponding with her through the Force to discern her location. Rey has been searching for a second wayfinder; Ren tries to stop her from finding it. Eventually, Ren informs Rey that she is Palpatine's granddaughter, and furthermore, they are a dyad in the Force with extremely powerful potential when joined together. He urges her once more to take his hand, and to overthrow Palpatine together. Rey refuses, but Ren is unwilling to kill her and follows her to [[Kef Bir]], the location of the second wayfinder. Meeting her on the wreckage of the [[second Death Star]], Ren destroys Rey's wayfinder and duels her. The duel ends with Rey impaling Ren, who had been distracted by his dying mother, Leia, reaching out to him through the Force. A guilt-ridden Rey uses the Force to heal Ren and leaves aboard his ship, after telling him that she wanted to take Ben Solo's hand, but not Kylo Ren's. Alone on the wreckage, Ren converses with a memory of his father, Han Solo; he throws away his lightsaber, renouncing his role as Supreme Leader and reclaiming his old identity of Ben Solo.\n\nBen rushes to help Rey defeat Palpatine on Exegol. Rey senses his presence and uses their Force connection to give him Anakin's lightsaber, which Ben uses to defeat the Knights of Ren. Palpatine then senses Rey and Ben's connection as a dyad of the Force, and absorbs their energy to restore his full power, before casting Ben into an abyss. However, Rey manages to defeat and kill Palpatine before dying from the effort. Ben climbs out of the abyss and finds Rey's inert body. Ben manages to transfer all of his life essence into her, successfully resuscitating her but sacrificing his own life in the process. They share a passionate kiss before Ben dies peacefully in Rey's arms. His body fades away simultaneously with his mother's, becoming one with the Force.\n\n===Related works and promotional material===\nKylo is a playable character in the 2015 ''The Force Awakens'' add-on to the ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'' video game, with an ''Infinity'' character figurine available separately.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2015/10/12/the-force-awakens-kylo-ren-poe-dameron/ |title=''Disney Infinity: The Force Awakens'' Dated, Adds Kylo Ren And Poe Dameron |work=Forbes |first=Andy |last=Robertson |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/12/09/disney-infinitys-star-wars-the-force-awakens-lets-john-boyega-play-with-himself/ |title=Disney Infinity's ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' lets John Boyega play with himself |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |first=Giancarlo |last=Valdes |date=December 9, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-force-awakens-play-set-for-disney-infinity-3-0-edition-now-available |title=''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' Play Set for ''Disney Infinity 3.0'' Edition Now Available |publisher=StarWars.com |date=December 18, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2015/12/16/disney-infinity-star-wars-the-force-awakens-game/77412314/ |title=''Infinity'' adds to ''Force Awakens'' experience |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Brian |last=Truitt |date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref> He is also a character in the [[strategy video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Force Arena]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Compendio|first1=Chris|title=Kylo Ren and Rey Finally Join Mobile Game ''Star Wars: Force Arena''|url=https://screenrant.com/kylo-ren-rey-star-wars-force-arena/|publisher=Screen Rant|date=November 9, 2017|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Hasbro]] has released a {{convert|3+3/4|in|cm|adj=on}} Kylo Ren action figure,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blastr.com/2015-8-14/leaked-peek-hasbros-kylo-ren-captain-phasma-and-10-more-force-awakens-action-figures |title=Leaked peek at Hasbro's Kylo Ren, Captain Phasma and 10 more ''The Force Awakens'' action figures |publisher=[[Blastr]] |first=Jeff |last=Spry |date=August 14, 2015 |accessdate=January 3, 2016}}</ref> and a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} figure in their Black Series line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rebelscum.com/03-Kylo-Ren-The-Black-Series-Star-Wars-Hasbro-2015.asp |title=03 Kylo Ren from Hasbro's The Black Series |publisher=Rebelscum.com |first=D.

It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"<ref name=\"91I71\" />\n\nFIFA president [[Gianni Infantino]] stated: \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true. A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.\"<ref name=\"kVyG9\" /> Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be \"the best World Cup ever\", as 98% of the stadiums were sold out, there were three billion viewers on TV around the world and seven million fans visited the fan fests.<ref name=\"kl1QG\" />\n\nHowever, the tournament was called a distraction from the international isolation and economic difficulties Russia has been facing.<ref name=\"FhofV\" /><ref name=\"ve3Sg\" /><ref name=\"M6MSu\" />\n\n==Broadcasting rights==\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights}}\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than four million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2&nbsp;June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so. On 12&nbsp;July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014; match scheduling was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as it was in 2014. Many matches aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history.<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

football|football]] tournament contested by [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] and took place between 14&nbsp;June and 15&nbsp;July 2018 in Russia. It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\nThe 22-member [[FIFA Council|FIFA Executive Committee]] convened in [[Z\u00fcrich]] on 2&nbsp;December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.<ref name=\"WFQKr\" /> Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.

Controversial issues included the level of racism in Russian football,<ref name=\"emKvG\" /><ref name=\"LlUcj\" /><ref name=\"hjJfX\" /> human rights abuses by the Russian government,<ref name=\"hkImm\" /> and discrimination against [[LGBT]] people in wider Russian society.<ref name=\"qKYJ4\" /><ref name=\"rMyFt\" /> Russia's involvement in the [[War in Donbass|ongoing conflict in Ukraine]] had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]].<ref name=\"eGuva\" /><ref name=\"tQHRS\" /> In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that \"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\".<ref name=\"UeAW8\" />\n\nAllegations of [[corruption]] in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England's [[The Football Association|FA]] to boycott the tournament.<ref name=\"mZGjr\" /> They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and [[Sepp Blatter]] had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.<ref name=\"sRBCC\" /> FIFA appointed [[Michael J. Garcia]], a US attorney, to investigate and produce [[Garcia Report|a report]] on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. [[Greg Dyke]] called for a re-examination of the affair and [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] called for a boycott of the World Cup.<ref name=\"zt9ZM\" /><ref name=\"2xMiJ\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in Eckert's independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7&nbsp;June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Qualification===\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations\u2014the 209 [[List of FIFA Member Associations|FIFA member associations]] except automatically qualified hosts Russia\u2014applied to enter the qualifying process.<ref name=\"riaYh\" /> [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] were later disqualified before playing their first matches,<ref name=\"zimbabwe\" /><ref name=\"indonesia\" /> while [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] and [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], who joined FIFA on 13&nbsp;May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.<ref name=\"k8fRX\" /> Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.<ref name=\"fifa20150320\" /><ref name=\"hstri\" /> The first qualification game, between [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] and [[Mongolia national football team|Mongolia]], began in [[Dili]] on 12&nbsp;March 2015 as part of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC's qualification]],<ref name=\"45Ip9\" /> and the main qualifying draw took place at the [[Konstantinovsky Palace]] in [[Strelna]], [[Saint Petersburg]], on 25&nbsp;July 2015.<ref name=\"L1urj\" /><ref name=\"crlmz\" /><ref name=\"lzli9\" /><ref name=\"press release\" />\n\nOf the 32&nbsp;nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20&nbsp;countries competed at the previous tournament in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]].

It was the first time three [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four [[Arab world|Arab nations]] (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.<ref name=\"vviY2\" />\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden, and three-time runners-up and third placed in 2014 the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (for the first time since 2002).

/>\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15&nbsp;June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first

name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Each city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />{{dead link|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29&nbsp;September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion was spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8&nbsp;October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium\u2014the two largest stadiums in Russia\u2014were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.

The arena hosted its first match on 21&nbsp;April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished [[Central Stadium (Volgograd)|Central Stadium]] site, at the foot of the [[Mamayev Kurgan]] memorial complex. It was commissioned on 3&nbsp;April 2018.<ref name=\"j2Lhd\" />\n* Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"<ref name=\"91I71\" />\n\nFIFA president [[Gianni Infantino]] stated: \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true. A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.\"<ref name=\"kVyG9\" /> Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be \"the best World Cup ever\", as 98% of the stadiums were sold out, there were three billion viewers on TV around the world and seven million fans visited the fan fests.<ref name=\"kl1QG\" />\n\nHowever, the tournament was called a distraction from the international isolation and economic difficulties Russia has been facing.<ref name=\"FhofV\" /><ref name=\"ve3Sg\" /><ref name=\"M6MSu\" />\n\n==Broadcasting rights==\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights}}\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than four million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2&nbsp;June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so. On 12&nbsp;July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014; match scheduling was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as it was in 2014. Many matches aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history.<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

Fisher Unwin]],{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=41}} where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'' gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.\n\nEarly on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images.  Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. [[Father Brown]] is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story \"The Flying Stars\", Father Brown entreats the character [[Flambeau (character)|Flambeau]] to give up his life of crime: \"There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I've known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Chesterton |first=G.

This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts.{{sfn|Ker|2011}}\n\nThe talks were very popular.

He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, Catholic theologian<ref>Bridges, Horace J. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/ethicaladdresses21ameruoft#page/20/mode/2up \"G.

Chesterton a Theologian?,\" ''The Chesterton Review''. (Rep. by [http://catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0499.html ''CERC: Catholic Education Research Center''].)</ref> and [[apologist]], debater, and mystery writer. He was a columnist for the ''Daily News'', ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', and his own paper, ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]''; he also wrote articles for the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', including the entry on [[Charles Dickens]] and part of the entry on Humour in the 14th edition (1929). His best-known character is the priest-detective [[Father Brown]],<ref name=\"Father Brown on Chesterton,\"/> who appeared only in short stories, while ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on [[distributism]] were popularised through ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', published by [[Seward Collins]] in New York.\n\nOf his nonfiction, ''Charles Dickens: A Critical Study'' (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to [[Ian Ker]] (''The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845\u20131961'', 2003), \"In Chesterton's eyes Dickens belongs to [[Merry England|Merry]], not [[Puritan]], England\"; Ker treats Chesterton's thought in Chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time.\n\nChesterton's writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.<ref>Douglas, J. D.

Dickens' approach is one of these. Another is represented by [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]], whom Chesterton knew well: satirists and social commentators following in the tradition of [[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler]], vigorously wielding paradox as a weapon against complacent acceptance of the conventional view of things.\n\nChesterton's style and thinking were all his own, however, and his conclusions were often opposed to those of Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. In his book ''[[Heretics (book)|Heretics]]'', Chesterton has this to say of Wilde: \"The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde.  It is the [[carpe diem]] religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch7.html chapter 7]}}  More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: \"Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.\"\n\nChesterton and Shaw were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions.  Although rarely in agreement, they both maintained good will toward, and respect for, each other. However, in his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In ''Heretics'' he writes of Shaw:\n\n{{quote |After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch4.html chapter 4]}}}}\n\nShaw represented the new school of thought, [[modernism]], which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' he writes: \"The worship of will is the negation of will \u2026 If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch20.html chapter 20]}}\n\n[[File:Title Page of Orthodoxy, by G.K. Chesterton.png|thumb|Title page of the 1909 edition of ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'', first published in the previous year]]\nThis style of argumentation is what Chesterton refers to as using 'Uncommon Sense' \u2013 that is, that the thinkers and popular philosophers of the day, though very clever, were saying things that were nonsensical. This is illustrated again in ''Orthodoxy'': \"Thus when Mr. H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), 'All chairs are quite different', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them 'all chairs'.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1908b | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html chapter 3]}} Or, again from ''Orthodoxy'':\n\n<blockquote>The wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless \u2013 one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is \u2013 well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html|title=The Suicide of Thought>|work=dmu.ac.uk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nChesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both [[progressivism]] and [[conservatism]], saying, \"The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = The Blunders of Our Parties| newspaper = Illustrated London News | date = 19 April 1924}}.</ref> He was an early member of the [[Fabian Society]], but resigned from it at the time of the Boer War.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holroyd |first1=Michael |title=Bernard Shaw Vol 2 |date=1989 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |isbn=978-0701133504 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 214] |url=https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 }}</ref>\n\nAnother contemporary and friend from schooldays was [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|Edmund Bentley]], inventor of the [[clerihew]].  Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend's first published collection of poetry, ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), which popularised the clerihew form.  Chesterton was also godfather to Bentley's son, [[Nicolas Bentley|Nicolas]], and opened his novel ''The Man Who Was Thursday'' with a poem written to Bentley.\n\n===Charges of anti-Semitism===\n\nChesterton faced accusations of [[anti-Semitism]] during his lifetime, saying in chapter 13 of ''[[The New Jerusalem (Chesterton book)|The New Jerusalem]]'' (1920) that it was something \"for which my friends and I were for a long period rebuked and even reviled\". Despite his prostestations to the contrary, the accusation continues to be repeated.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1455054,00.html | title = Last orders | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 9 April 2005}}.</ref> An early supporter of [[Alfred Dreyfus|Captain Dreyfus]], by 1906 he had turned into an [[Dreyfus Affair|anti-dreyfusard]].<ref>Chesterton, Gilbert.

Chesterton writes that popular perception of Jewish moneylenders could well have led Edward I's subjects to regard him as a \"tender father of his people\" for \"breaking the rule by which the rulers had hitherto fostered their bankers' wealth\". He felt that Jews, \"a sensitive and highly civilized people\" who \"were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready for use\", might legitimately complain that \"Christian kings and nobles, and even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the fury of the poor\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Anthony | last = Julius | authorlink = Anthony Julius | title = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2010 | page = 422| title-link = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = G.

We desired that in some fashion, and so far as possible, Jews should be represented by Jews, should live in a society of Jews, should be judged by Jews and ruled by Jews. I am an Anti-Semite if that is Anti-Semitism. It would seem more rational to call it Semitism.</blockquote> In the same place he proposed the thought experiment (describing it as \"a parable\" and \"a flippant fancy\") that Jews should be admitted to any role in English public life on condition that they must wear distinctively Middle Eastern garb, explaining that \"The point is that we should know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land.\"\n\nChesterton, like Belloc, openly expressed his abhorrence of [[Hitler]]'s rule almost as soon as it started.<ref name = \"Pearce2005\">{{cite book | last = Pearce|first= Joseph|authorlink= Joseph Pearce| title= Literary Giants, Literary Catholics | year = 2005 | publisher = Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-58617-077-6|page= 95}}</ref> As [[Rabbi Stephen Wise]] wrote in a posthumous tribute to Chesterton in 1937 : \n<blockquote>When Hitlerism came, he was one of the first to speak out with all the directness and frankness of a great and unabashed spirit.

In ''The Feud of the Foreigner'' (1920) he said that the Jew \"is a foreigner far more remote from us than is a Bavarian from a Frenchman; he is divided by the same type of division as that between us and a Chinaman or a Hindoo. He not only is not, but never was, of the same race.\"<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\"/>\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Man'', while writing about human sacrifice, Chesterton suggested that medieval stories about [[Blood libel|Jews killing children]] might have resulted from a distortion of genuine cases of devil-worship. Chesterton wrote: <blockquote>the Hebrew prophets were perpetually protesting against the Hebrew race relapsing into an idolatry that involved such a war upon children; and it is probable enough that this abominable apostasy from the God of Israel has occasionally appeared in Israel since, in the form of what is called ritual murder; not of course by any representative of the religion of Judaism, but by individual and irresponsible diabolists who did happen to be Jews.<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\"/><ref name=Everlasting>{{cite book|title=The Everlasting Man|author=G.

Chesterton Anti-Semitic?,\"] by Dale Ahlquist.</ref>\n\n===Opposition to eugenics===\nIn ''Eugenics and Other Evils'' Chesterton attacked [[eugenics]] as Britain was moving towards passage of the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913]]. Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed \"mentally defective\"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, \"It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children.\"<ref name=Eugenics/> He blasted the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including \"Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs.

It is senseless to talk about breeding them; for they are not a breed.

The quotation is from Chesterton's 1929 book, ''The Thing: Why I am a Catholic'', in the chapter, \"The Drift from Domesticity\":\n\n<blockquote>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'<ref>Chesterton, G. K. (1929).

Fisher Unwin]],{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=41}} where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'' gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.\n\nEarly on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images.  Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. [[Father Brown]] is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story \"The Flying Stars\", Father Brown entreats the character [[Flambeau (character)|Flambeau]] to give up his life of crime: \"There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I've known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Chesterton |first=G.

This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts.{{sfn|Ker|2011}}\n\nThe talks were very popular.

He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, Catholic theologian<ref>Bridges, Horace J. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/ethicaladdresses21ameruoft#page/20/mode/2up \"G.

Chesterton a Theologian?,\" ''The Chesterton Review''. (Rep. by [http://catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0499.html ''CERC: Catholic Education Research Center''].)</ref> and [[apologist]], debater, and mystery writer. He was a columnist for the ''Daily News'', ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', and his own paper, ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]''; he also wrote articles for the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', including the entry on [[Charles Dickens]] and part of the entry on Humour in the 14th edition (1929). His best-known character is the priest-detective [[Father Brown]],<ref name=\"Father Brown on Chesterton,\"/> who appeared only in short stories, while ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on [[distributism]] were popularised through ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', published by [[Seward Collins]] in New York.\n\nOf his nonfiction, ''Charles Dickens: A Critical Study'' (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to [[Ian Ker]] (''The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845\u20131961'', 2003), \"In Chesterton's eyes Dickens belongs to [[Merry England|Merry]], not [[Puritan]], England\"; Ker treats Chesterton's thought in Chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time.\n\nChesterton's writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.<ref>Douglas, J. D. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-27-52.0.html \"G.K. Chesterton, the Eccentric Prince of Paradox,\"] ''Christianity Today'', 8 January 2001.</ref><ref>Gray, Robert.

Dickens' approach is one of these. Another is represented by [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]], whom Chesterton knew well: satirists and social commentators following in the tradition of [[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler]], vigorously wielding paradox as a weapon against complacent acceptance of the conventional view of things.\n\nChesterton's style and thinking were all his own, however, and his conclusions were often opposed to those of Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. In his book ''[[Heretics (book)|Heretics]]'', Chesterton has this to say of Wilde: \"The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde.  It is the [[carpe diem]] religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch7.html chapter 7]}}  More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: \"Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.\"\n\nChesterton and Shaw were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions.  Although rarely in agreement, they both maintained good will toward, and respect for, each other. However, in his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In ''Heretics'' he writes of Shaw:\n\n{{quote |After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch4.html chapter 4]}}}}\n\nShaw represented the new school of thought, [[modernism]], which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' he writes: \"The worship of will is the negation of will \u2026 If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch20.html chapter 20]}}\n\n[[File:Title Page of Orthodoxy, by G.K. Chesterton.png|thumb|Title page of the 1909 edition of ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'', first published in the previous year]]\nThis style of argumentation is what Chesterton refers to as using 'Uncommon Sense' \u2013 that is, that the thinkers and popular philosophers of the day, though very clever, were saying things that were nonsensical. This is illustrated again in ''Orthodoxy'': \"Thus when Mr. H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), 'All chairs are quite different', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them 'all chairs'.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1908b | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html chapter 3]}} Or, again from ''Orthodoxy'':\n\n<blockquote>The wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless \u2013 one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is \u2013 well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html|title=The Suicide of Thought>|work=dmu.ac.uk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nChesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both [[progressivism]] and [[conservatism]], saying, \"The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = The Blunders of Our Parties| newspaper = Illustrated London News | date = 19 April 1924}}.</ref> He was an early member of the [[Fabian Society]], but resigned from it at the time of the Boer War.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holroyd |first1=Michael |title=Bernard Shaw Vol 2 |date=1989 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |isbn=978-0701133504 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 214] |url=https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 }}</ref>\n\nAnother contemporary and friend from schooldays was [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|Edmund Bentley]], inventor of the [[clerihew]].  Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend's first published collection of poetry, ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), which popularised the clerihew form.  Chesterton was also godfather to Bentley's son, [[Nicolas Bentley|Nicolas]], and opened his novel ''The Man Who Was Thursday'' with a poem written to Bentley.\n\n===Charges of anti-Semitism===\n\nChesterton faced accusations of [[anti-Semitism]] during his lifetime, saying in chapter 13 of ''[[The New Jerusalem (Chesterton book)|The New Jerusalem]]'' (1920) that it was something \"for which my friends and I were for a long period rebuked and even reviled\". Despite his prostestations to the contrary, the accusation continues to be repeated.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1455054,00.html | title = Last orders | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 9 April 2005}}.</ref> An early supporter of [[Alfred Dreyfus|Captain Dreyfus]], by 1906 he had turned into an [[Dreyfus Affair|anti-dreyfusard]].<ref>Chesterton, Gilbert.

Chesterton writes that popular perception of Jewish moneylenders could well have led Edward I's subjects to regard him as a \"tender father of his people\" for \"breaking the rule by which the rulers had hitherto fostered their bankers' wealth\". He felt that Jews, \"a sensitive and highly civilized people\" who \"were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready for use\", might legitimately complain that \"Christian kings and nobles, and even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the fury of the poor\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Anthony | last = Julius | authorlink = Anthony Julius | title = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2010 | page = 422| title-link = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = G.

We desired that in some fashion, and so far as possible, Jews should be represented by Jews, should live in a society of Jews, should be judged by Jews and ruled by Jews. I am an Anti-Semite if that is Anti-Semitism. It would seem more rational to call it Semitism.</blockquote> In the same place he proposed the thought experiment (describing it as \"a parable\" and \"a flippant fancy\") that Jews should be admitted to any role in English public life on condition that they must wear distinctively Middle Eastern garb, explaining that \"The point is that we should know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land.\"\n\nChesterton, like Belloc, openly expressed his abhorrence of [[Hitler]]'s rule almost as soon as it started.<ref name = \"Pearce2005\">{{cite book | last = Pearce|first= Joseph|authorlink= Joseph Pearce| title= Literary Giants, Literary Catholics | year = 2005 | publisher = Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-58617-077-6|page= 95}}</ref> As [[Rabbi Stephen Wise]] wrote in a posthumous tribute to Chesterton in 1937 : \n<blockquote>When Hitlerism came, he was one of the first to speak out with all the directness and frankness of a great and unabashed spirit.

His own bones are the sacred relics; his own blood is the [[Januarius#Blood|blood of St. Januarius]].\"<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\">{{cite book|pages=85\u201387|title=Chesterton's Jews: Stereotypes and Caricatures in the Literature and Journalism of G.K.

In ''The Feud of the Foreigner'' (1920) he said that the Jew \"is a foreigner far more remote from us than is a Bavarian from a Frenchman; he is divided by the same type of division as that between us and a Chinaman or a Hindoo. He not only is not, but never was, of the same race.\"<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\"/>\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Man'', while writing about human sacrifice, Chesterton suggested that medieval stories about [[Blood libel|Jews killing children]] might have resulted from a distortion of genuine cases of devil-worship. Chesterton wrote: <blockquote>the Hebrew prophets were perpetually protesting against the Hebrew race relapsing into an idolatry that involved such a war upon children; and it is probable enough that this abominable apostasy from the God of Israel has occasionally appeared in Israel since, in the form of what is called ritual murder; not of course by any representative of the religion of Judaism, but by individual and irresponsible diabolists who did happen to be Jews.<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\"/><ref name=Everlasting>{{cite book|title=The Everlasting Man|author=G.

Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed \"mentally defective\"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, \"It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children.\"<ref name=Eugenics/> He blasted the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including \"Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs. That is the situation; and that is the point \u2026 we are already under the Eugenist State; and nothing remains to us but rebellion.\"<ref name=Eugenics>{{cite book|title=Eugenics and Other Evils|author=Gilbert Keith Chesterton|publisher=Cassell and Company, Ltd|location=London, UK|year=1922}}</ref>\n\nHe derided such ideas as founded on nonsense, \"as if one had a right to dragoon and enslave one's fellow citizens as a kind of chemical experiment\".<ref name=Eugenics/>\n\nChesterton also mocked the idea that poverty was a result of bad breeding: \"[it is a] strange new disposition to regard the poor as a race; as if they were a colony of Japs or Chinese coolies \u2026 The poor are not a race or even a type. It is senseless to talk about breeding them; for they are not a breed. They are, in cold fact, what Dickens describes: 'a dustbin of individual accidents,' of damaged dignity, and often of damaged gentility.\"<ref name=Eugenics/>\n\n===\"Chesterbelloc\"===\n{{See also|G.

The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think.
