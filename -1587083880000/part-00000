Cruise missiles are designed to deliver a large [[warhead]] over long distances with high precision. Modern cruise missiles are capable of travelling at [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] or high [[Aerodynamics#Incompressible aerodynamics|subsonic]] speeds, are self-navigating, and are able to fly on a non-[[Ballistics|ballistic]], extremely low-altitude trajectory.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Fieseler Fi-103.jpg|thumb|A Fieseler Fi-103, the German [[V-1 flying bomb]]]]\nThe idea of an \"aerial torpedo\" was shown in the British 1909 film ''[[The Airship Destroyer]]'', where flying torpedoes controlled wirelessly are used to bring down airships bombing London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/rpav_britain.html |title=Remote Piloted Aerial Vehicles : The 'Aerial Target' and 'Aerial Torpedo' in Britain |publisher=Ctie.monash.edu.au |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916, American aviator [[Lawrence Sperry]] built and patented an \"aerial torpedo\", the [[Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane]], a small biplane carrying a TNT charge, a Sperry [[autopilot]] and a barometric altitude control. Inspired by these experiments, the United States Army developed a similar flying bomb called the [[Kettering Bug]]. Germany had also flown trials with remote-controlled aerial gliders ''(Torpedogleiter)'' built by Siemens-Schuckert beginning in 1916.<ref>Roger Branfill-Cook, \"Torpedo\", Seaforth Publishing, Great Britain 2014</ref>\n\nIn the period between the World Wars the UK developed the [[RAE Larynx|Larynx (Long Range Gun with Lynx Engine)]], which underwent a few flight tests in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/twcruz_1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813001620/http://www.vectorsite.net/twcruz_1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 August 2007|title=[1.0] The Aerial Torpedo|date=13 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], [[Sergei Korolev]] headed the [[Group for the Study of Reactive Motion|GIRD]]-06 cruise missile project from 1932 to 1939, which used a rocket-powered boost-[[glide bomb]] design. The 06/III (RP-216) and 06/IV (RP-212) contained gyroscopic guidance systems.<ref>\"Object No. 212\", 1936 report in _Tvorcheskoi Nasledie Akedemika Sergeya Pavlovicha Koroleva_</ref> The vehicle was designed to boost to 28&nbsp;km altitude and glide a distance of 280&nbsp;km, but test flights in 1934 and 1936 only reached an altitude of 500 meters.\n\nIn 1944, Germany deployed the first operational cruise missiles in [[World War II]]. The [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]], often called a [[flying bomb]], contained a [[gyroscope]] guidance system and was propelled by a simple [[pulsejet]] engine, the sound of which gave it the nickname of \"buzz bomb\" or \"doodlebug\". Accuracy was sufficient only for use against very large targets (the general area of a city), while the range of 250&nbsp;km was significantly lower than that of a bomber carrying the same payload. The main advantages were speed (although not sufficient to outperform contemporary propeller-driven interceptors) and expendability. The production cost of a V-1 was only a small fraction of that of a [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] [[ballistic missile]], carrying a similar-sized warhead.<ref>Both missiles were manufactured under the heavy use of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Nazi slave labour]].</ref> Unlike the V-2, the initial deployments of the V-1 required stationary launch ramps which were susceptible to bombardment. Nazi Germany, in 1943, also developed the [[Mistel]] [[composite aircraft]] program, which can be seen as a rudimentary air-launched cruise missile, where a piloted fighter-type aircraft was mounted atop an unpiloted bomber-sized aircraft that was packed with explosives to be released while approaching the target. Bomber-launched variants of the V-1 saw limited operational service near the end of the war, with the pioneering V-1's design reverse-engineered by the Americans as the [[Republic-Ford JB-2]] cruise missile.\n\nImmediately after the war the [[United States Air Force]] had 21 different guided missile projects, including would-be cruise missiles.  All but four were cancelled by 1948,&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Air Materiel Command]] [[BANSHEE]], the [[SM-62 Snark]], the [[SM-64 Navaho]], and the [[MGM-1 Matador]]. The BANSHEE design was similar to [[Operation Aphrodite]]; like Aphrodite, it failed, and was cancelled in April 1949.<ref>[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA162646 The Evolution of the Cruise Missile by Werrell, Kenneth P.] see PDF page 92 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304213844/http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA162646 |date=4 March 2007 }}</ref> Concurrently, the US Navy's Operation: BUMBLEBEE, was conducted at Topsail Island, North Carolina, from c. 1 June 1946, to 28 July 1948.<ref>[[Operation Bumblebee]]{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}</ref> Operation: BUMBLEBEE produced proof-of-concept technologies that influenced the US military's other missile projects.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] experimented further with the concept, deploying early cruise missiles from land, submarines and aircraft. The main outcome of the United States Navy submarine missile project was the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] missile, based upon the V-1.\n\nThe United States Air Force's first operational surface-to-surface missile was the winged, mobile, nuclear-capable [[MGM-1 Matador]], also similar in concept to the V-1. Deployment overseas began in 1954, first to West Germany and later to the Republic of China (Taiwan) and South Korea. On 7 November 1956, U.S. Air Force deployed Matador units in West Germany, whose missiles were capable of striking targets in the Warsaw Pact, from their fixed day-to-day sites to unannounced dispersed launch locations. This alert was in response to the crisis posed by the Soviet attack on Hungary which suppressed the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].\n\nBetween 1957 and 1961 the United States followed an ambitious and well-funded program to develop a nuclear-powered cruise missile, [[Supersonic Low Altitude Missile]] (SLAM). It was designed to fly below the enemy's radar at speeds above [[Mach number|Mach]] 3 and carry [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]] that it would drop along its path over enemy territory. Although the concept was proven sound and the 500 [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]] engine finished a successful test run in 1961, no airworthy device was ever completed. The project was finally abandoned in favor of [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] development.\n\nWhile [[ballistic missile]]s were the preferred weapons for land targets, heavy nuclear and [[conventional weapon]] tipped cruise missiles were seen by the USSR as a primary weapon to destroy United States naval [[carrier battle group]]s. Large submarines (for example, [[Echo-class submarine|Echo]] and [[Oscar-class submarine|Oscar]] classes) were developed to carry these weapons and shadow United States battle groups at sea, and large bombers (for example, [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Backfire]], [[Tupolev Tu-95|Bear]], and [[Tupolev Tu-160|Blackjack]] models) were equipped with the weapons in their air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) configuration.\n\n==General design==\nCruise missiles generally consist of a [[guidance system]], payload, and [[aircraft propulsion]] system, housed in an [[airframe]] with small wings and [[empennage]] for flight control. Payloads usually consist of a conventional warhead or a [[Nuclear Weapon|nuclear warhead]]. Cruise missiles tend to be propelled by [[jet engine]], with [[turbofan]] engines in particular being preferred due to their greater efficiency at low altitude and subsonic speed.\n\n===Guidance systems===\n{{Main|Missile guidance}}\nGuidance systems also vary greatly. Low-cost systems use a [[radar altimeter]], barometric altimeter and [[clock]] to navigate a [[Digital data|digital]] strip [[map]]. More advanced systems use [[inertial guidance]], [[satellite guidance]] and [[TERCOM|terrain contour matching (TERCOM)]]. Use of an [[automatic target recognition|automatic target recognition (ATR)]] algorithm/device in the guidance system increases accuracy of the missile. The [[Standoff Land Attack Missile]] features an ATR unit from [[General Electric]].\n\n==Categories==\nCruise missiles can be categorized by size, speed (subsonic or supersonic), and range, and whether launched from land, air, surface ship, or submarine. Often versions of the same missile are produced for different launch platforms; sometimes air- and submarine-launched versions are a little lighter and smaller than land- and ship-launched versions.\n\nGuidance systems can vary across missiles. Some missiles can be fitted with any of a variety of navigation systems ([[Inertial navigation]], [[TERCOM]], or [[satellite navigation]]). Larger cruise missiles can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead, while smaller ones carry only conventional warheads.\n\n===Hypersonic===\n{{redirect|Hypersonic Missiles|the Sam Fender album|Hypersonic Missiles (album)}}\nA [[hypersonic flight|hypersonic speed]] cruise missile would travel at least five times the [[speed of sound]] ([[Mach number|Mach]] 5).\n<!-- Please maintain list in alphabetical order -->\n\n*[[3M22 Zircon]] {{flagicon|RUS}} Hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nextbigfuture.com/2016/02/russia-will-refit-nuclear-powered.html|title=Russia will refit nuclear powered guided missile cruiser with mach 5 hypersonic 3M22 missiles with 2022 deployment - NextBigFuture.com|date=21 February 2016}}</ref>\n*[[BrahMos-II]] (\u2248600\u2013800&nbsp;km) {{flagicon|IND}}/{{flagicon|RUS}} is a hypersonic missile currently under development in India and Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-10-09/news/30260244_1_air-version-stealth-supersonic-cruise-missile-india-s-defence-research|title=Hypersonic version of Brahmos on the way|date=9 October 2011|work=The Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmos.com/newscenter.php?newsid=102|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212050609/http://brahmos.com/newscenter.php?newsid=102|archivedate=12 December 2010|url-status=dead|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref>\n*[[Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle]] {{flagicon|IND}} Hypersonic scramjet demonstration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theprint.in/defence/drdo-test-fires-futuristic-missile-tech-but-its-success-is-in-doubt/249386/|title=DRDO test-fires futuristic missile tech, but its success is in doubt|last=Philip|first=Snehesh Alex|date=2019-06-12|website=ThePrint|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-starts-work-on-hypersonic-weapon/story-NAg6ViN9W94ll4CsfGDNYP.html|title=DRDO starts work on \u2018next-gen\u2019 hypersonic weapon|date=2019-10-20|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n*[[High Speed Strike Weapon]] missile based on [[Boeing X-51]]. {{flagicon|US}}\n*[[Kh-90]] (3,000\u20134,000&nbsp;km) {{flagicon|USSR}}/{{flagicon|RUS}} is a hypersonic [[Air-to-surface missile|air-to-surface cruise missile]] developed in 1990 by the USSR and later by Russia.

Both missile types are configurable for either conventional or nuclear warheads.\n\n[[File:BRAHMOS Launcher.JPG|thumb|left|[[Indian Army]]'s BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles mounted on Mobile Autonomous Launchers (MAL).]]\nThe USAF adopted the AGM-86 for its bomber fleet while AGM-109 was adapted to launch from trucks and ships and adopted by the USAF and Navy. The truck-launched versions, and also the Pershing II and SS-20 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles, were later destroyed under the bilateral INF (Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces) treaty with the USSR.\n\nThe British [[Royal Navy]] (RN) also operates cruise missiles, specifically the U.S.-made Tomahawk, used by the RN's nuclear submarine fleet. UK conventional warhead versions were first fired in combat by the RN in 1999, during the [[Kosovo War]] (the United States fired cruise missiles in 1991). The [[Royal Air Force]] uses the [[Storm Shadow]] cruise missile on its [[Tornado GR4]] aircraft. It is also used by France, where it is known as SCALP EG, and carried by the [[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'s [[Mirage 2000]] and [[Rafale]] aircraft.\n\nIndia and Russia have jointly developed the supersonic cruise missile [[BrahMos]]. There are three versions of the Brahmos: ship/land-launched, air-launched and sub-launched. The ship/land-launched version were operational as of late 2007.

In this short time frame, the Soviet Union was working on nearly ten different types of cruise missiles. However, due to resources, most of the initial types of cruise missiles developed by the Soviet Union were Sea- Launched Cruise Missiles or Submarine-Launched Cruise Missiles ([[Submarine-launched cruise missile|SLCM]]<nowiki/>s). The [[KSShch|SS-N-1]] cruise missile was developed to have different configurations to be fired from a submarine or a ship. However, as the time progressed, the Soviet Union began to work on air launched cruise missiles as well ([[Air-launched cruise missile|ALCM]]). These ACLM missiles were typically delivered via bombers designated as \"Blinders\" or \"Backfire\". The missiles in this configuration were called the AS-1, and AS-2 with eventual new variants with more development time. The main purpose of Soviet-based cruise missiles was to have defense and offensive mechanisms against enemy ships; in other words most of the Soviet cruise missiles were anti-ship missiles. the 1980s the Soviet Union had developed an arsenal of cruise missiles nearing 600 platforms which consisted of land, sea, and air delivery systems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arkin|first=William|date=May 1983|title=Soviet Cruise Missile Programs|journal=Arms Control Today|volume=13|issue=4|pages=3\u20134|jstor=23623103}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\n{{See also|United States and weapons of mass destruction}}\n[[File:Agm-129 acm.jpg|thumb|right|An [[AGM-129 ACM]] of the [[United States Air Force]]]]\n\nThe United States has deployed four nuclear cruise missiles at one time or another.\n*[[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] submarine-launched missile, out of service\n*[[AGM-86 ALCM]] air-launched cruise missile, 350 to 550 missiles and [[W80 (nuclear warhead)|W80]] warheads still in service\n*[[Tomahawk (missile)|BGM-109 Tomahawk]] cruise missile in nuclear submarine-, surface ship-, and ground-launched models, nuclear models out of service but warheads kept in reserve.\n*[[AGM-129 ACM]] Advanced Cruise missile, out of service<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tinker.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123299303 |title=Cruise missile career comes to a close |publisher=U.S. Air Force, Tinker Air Force Base public affairs |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220061518/http://www.tinker.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123299303 |archivedate=20 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Efficiency in modern warfare===\nCurrently cruise missiles are among the most expensive of single-use weapons, up to several million dollars apiece. One consequence of this is that its users face difficult choices in [[targeting (warfare)|target allocation]], to avoid expending the missiles on targets of low value. For instance, during [[Operation Enduring Freedom|the 2001 strikes on Afghanistan]] the United States attacked targets of very low monetary value with cruise missiles, which led many to question the efficiency of the weapon. However, proponents of the cruise missile counter that the same argument applies to other types of [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s: they are cheaper than human pilots when total training and infrastructure costs are taken into account, not to mention the risk of loss of personnel. As demonstrated in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn|Libya in 2011]] and prior conflicts, cruise missiles are much more difficult to detect and intercept than other aerial assets (reduced radar cross-section, infrared and visual signature due to smaller size), suiting them to attacks against static air defense systems.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Affordable Weapon System]]\n* [[Cruise missile submarine]]\n* [[Eugene Vielle]] (pioneer of technology that led to the Cruise missile)\n* [[Expendable launch system]]\n* [[List of cruise missiles]]\n* [[List of rocket aircraft]]\n* [[Lists of weapons]]\n* [[Low Cost Miniature Cruise Missile]]\n* [[NATO reporting name]] (has lists of various Soviet missiles)\n* [[Weapon of mass destruction]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons}}\n*[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA162646 The Evolution of the Cruise Missile by Werrell, Kenneth P.]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100815011742/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1981/jan-feb/werrell.htm The Cruise Missile: Precursors and Problems by Werrell, Kenneth P.]\n*[https://fas.org/nuke/intro/cm/index.html An introduction to cruise missiles]&nbsp;\u2014 From the website of the Federation of American Scientists (FAS)\n*[https://missilethreat.csis.org/ Missile Threat: A Project of the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]]]\n\n{{Missile types}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cruise Missile}}\n[[Category:Cruise missiles| ]]\n[[Category:Missile types]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||missile that follows a ballistic trajectory|Ballistic missile}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Tomahawk Block IV cruise missile.jpg|thumb|United States [[Tomahawk cruise missile]]]]\n[[File:Taurus ILA2006.JPG|thumb|[[Taurus KEPD 350]] cruise missile of the [[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]]]]\n\nA '''cruise missile''' is a [[Missile|guided missile]] used against terrestrial targets, that remains in the atmosphere and flies the major portion of its flight path at approximately constant speed.

Inspired by these experiments, the United States Army developed a similar flying bomb called the [[Kettering Bug]]. Germany had also flown trials with remote-controlled aerial gliders ''(Torpedogleiter)'' built by Siemens-Schuckert beginning in 1916.<ref>Roger Branfill-Cook, \"Torpedo\", Seaforth Publishing, Great Britain 2014</ref>\n\nIn the period between the World Wars the UK developed the [[RAE Larynx|Larynx (Long Range Gun with Lynx Engine)]], which underwent a few flight tests in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/twcruz_1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813001620/http://www.vectorsite.net/twcruz_1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 August 2007|title=[1.0] The Aerial Torpedo|date=13 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], [[Sergei Korolev]] headed the [[Group for the Study of Reactive Motion|GIRD]]-06 cruise missile project from 1932 to 1939, which used a rocket-powered boost-[[glide bomb]] design. The 06/III (RP-216) and 06/IV (RP-212) contained gyroscopic guidance systems.<ref>\"Object No. 212\", 1936 report in _Tvorcheskoi Nasledie Akedemika Sergeya Pavlovicha Koroleva_</ref> The vehicle was designed to boost to 28&nbsp;km altitude and glide a distance of 280&nbsp;km, but test flights in 1934 and 1936 only reached an altitude of 500 meters.\n\nIn 1944, Germany deployed the first operational cruise missiles in [[World War II]]. The [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]], often called a [[flying bomb]], contained a [[gyroscope]] guidance system and was propelled by a simple [[pulsejet]] engine, the sound of which gave it the nickname of \"buzz bomb\" or \"doodlebug\". Accuracy was sufficient only for use against very large targets (the general area of a city), while the range of 250&nbsp;km was significantly lower than that of a bomber carrying the same payload. The main advantages were speed (although not sufficient to outperform contemporary propeller-driven interceptors) and expendability. The production cost of a V-1 was only a small fraction of that of a [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] [[ballistic missile]], carrying a similar-sized warhead.<ref>Both missiles were manufactured under the heavy use of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Nazi slave labour]].</ref> Unlike the V-2, the initial deployments of the V-1 required stationary launch ramps which were susceptible to bombardment. Nazi Germany, in 1943, also developed the [[Mistel]] [[composite aircraft]] program, which can be seen as a rudimentary air-launched cruise missile, where a piloted fighter-type aircraft was mounted atop an unpiloted bomber-sized aircraft that was packed with explosives to be released while approaching the target. Bomber-launched variants of the V-1 saw limited operational service near the end of the war, with the pioneering V-1's design reverse-engineered by the Americans as the [[Republic-Ford JB-2]] cruise missile.\n\nImmediately after the war the [[United States Air Force]] had 21 different guided missile projects, including would-be cruise missiles.  All but four were cancelled by 1948,&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Air Materiel Command]] [[BANSHEE]], the [[SM-62 Snark]], the [[SM-64 Navaho]], and the [[MGM-1 Matador]]. The BANSHEE design was similar to [[Operation Aphrodite]]; like Aphrodite, it failed, and was cancelled in April 1949.<ref>[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA162646 The Evolution of the Cruise Missile by Werrell, Kenneth P.] see PDF page 92 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304213844/http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA162646 |date=4 March 2007 }}</ref> Concurrently, the US Navy's Operation: BUMBLEBEE, was conducted at Topsail Island, North Carolina, from c. 1 June 1946, to 28 July 1948.<ref>[[Operation Bumblebee]]{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}</ref> Operation: BUMBLEBEE produced proof-of-concept technologies that influenced the US military's other missile projects.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] experimented further with the concept, deploying early cruise missiles from land, submarines and aircraft. The main outcome of the United States Navy submarine missile project was the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] missile, based upon the V-1.\n\nThe United States Air Force's first operational surface-to-surface missile was the winged, mobile, nuclear-capable [[MGM-1 Matador]], also similar in concept to the V-1. Deployment overseas began in 1954, first to West Germany and later to the Republic of China (Taiwan) and South Korea. On 7 November 1956, U.S. Air Force deployed Matador units in West Germany, whose missiles were capable of striking targets in the Warsaw Pact, from their fixed day-to-day sites to unannounced dispersed launch locations. This alert was in response to the crisis posed by the Soviet attack on Hungary which suppressed the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].\n\nBetween 1957 and 1961 the United States followed an ambitious and well-funded program to develop a nuclear-powered cruise missile, [[Supersonic Low Altitude Missile]] (SLAM). It was designed to fly below the enemy's radar at speeds above [[Mach number|Mach]] 3 and carry [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]] that it would drop along its path over enemy territory. Although the concept was proven sound and the 500 [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]] engine finished a successful test run in 1961, no airworthy device was ever completed. The project was finally abandoned in favor of [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] development.\n\nWhile [[ballistic missile]]s were the preferred weapons for land targets, heavy nuclear and [[conventional weapon]] tipped cruise missiles were seen by the USSR as a primary weapon to destroy United States naval [[carrier battle group]]s. Large submarines (for example, [[Echo-class submarine|Echo]] and [[Oscar-class submarine|Oscar]] classes) were developed to carry these weapons and shadow United States battle groups at sea, and large bombers (for example, [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Backfire]], [[Tupolev Tu-95|Bear]], and [[Tupolev Tu-160|Blackjack]] models) were equipped with the weapons in their air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) configuration.\n\n==General design==\nCruise missiles generally consist of a [[guidance system]], payload, and [[aircraft propulsion]] system, housed in an [[airframe]] with small wings and [[empennage]] for flight control. Payloads usually consist of a conventional warhead or a [[Nuclear Weapon|nuclear warhead]]. Cruise missiles tend to be propelled by [[jet engine]], with [[turbofan]] engines in particular being preferred due to their greater efficiency at low altitude and subsonic speed.\n\n===Guidance systems===\n{{Main|Missile guidance}}\nGuidance systems also vary greatly. Low-cost systems use a [[radar altimeter]], barometric altimeter and [[clock]] to navigate a [[Digital data|digital]] strip [[map]]. More advanced systems use [[inertial guidance]], [[satellite guidance]] and [[TERCOM|terrain contour matching (TERCOM)]]. Use of an [[automatic target recognition|automatic target recognition (ATR)]] algorithm/device in the guidance system increases accuracy of the missile. The [[Standoff Land Attack Missile]] features an ATR unit from [[General Electric]].\n\n==Categories==\nCruise missiles can be categorized by size, speed (subsonic or supersonic), and range, and whether launched from land, air, surface ship, or submarine. Often versions of the same missile are produced for different launch platforms; sometimes air- and submarine-launched versions are a little lighter and smaller than land- and ship-launched versions.\n\nGuidance systems can vary across missiles. Some missiles can be fitted with any of a variety of navigation systems ([[Inertial navigation]], [[TERCOM]], or [[satellite navigation]]). Larger cruise missiles can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead, while smaller ones carry only conventional warheads.\n\n===Hypersonic===\n{{redirect|Hypersonic Missiles|the Sam Fender album|Hypersonic Missiles (album)}}\nA [[hypersonic flight|hypersonic speed]] cruise missile would travel at least five times the [[speed of sound]] ([[Mach number|Mach]] 5).\n<!-- Please maintain list in alphabetical order -->\n\n*[[3M22 Zircon]] {{flagicon|RUS}} Hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nextbigfuture.com/2016/02/russia-will-refit-nuclear-powered.html|title=Russia will refit nuclear powered guided missile cruiser with mach 5 hypersonic 3M22 missiles with 2022 deployment - NextBigFuture.com|date=21 February 2016}}</ref>\n*[[BrahMos-II]] (\u2248600\u2013800&nbsp;km) {{flagicon|IND}}/{{flagicon|RUS}} is a hypersonic missile currently under development in India and Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-10-09/news/30260244_1_air-version-stealth-supersonic-cruise-missile-india-s-defence-research|title=Hypersonic version of Brahmos on the way|date=9 October 2011|work=The Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmos.com/newscenter.php?newsid=102|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212050609/http://brahmos.com/newscenter.php?newsid=102|archivedate=12 December 2010|url-status=dead|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref>\n*[[Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle]] {{flagicon|IND}} Hypersonic scramjet demonstration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theprint.in/defence/drdo-test-fires-futuristic-missile-tech-but-its-success-is-in-doubt/249386/|title=DRDO test-fires futuristic missile tech, but its success is in doubt|last=Philip|first=Snehesh Alex|date=2019-06-12|website=ThePrint|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-starts-work-on-hypersonic-weapon/story-NAg6ViN9W94ll4CsfGDNYP.html|title=DRDO starts work on \u2018next-gen\u2019 hypersonic weapon|date=2019-10-20|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n*[[High Speed Strike Weapon]] missile based on [[Boeing X-51]]. {{flagicon|US}}\n*[[Kh-90]] (3,000\u20134,000&nbsp;km) {{flagicon|USSR}}/{{flagicon|RUS}} is a hypersonic [[Air-to-surface missile|air-to-surface cruise missile]] developed in 1990 by the USSR and later by Russia.

Both missile types are configurable for either conventional or nuclear warheads.\n\n[[File:BRAHMOS Launcher.JPG|thumb|left|[[Indian Army]]'s BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles mounted on Mobile Autonomous Launchers (MAL).]]\nThe USAF adopted the AGM-86 for its bomber fleet while AGM-109 was adapted to launch from trucks and ships and adopted by the USAF and Navy. The truck-launched versions, and also the Pershing II and SS-20 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles, were later destroyed under the bilateral INF (Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces) treaty with the USSR.\n\nThe British [[Royal Navy]] (RN) also operates cruise missiles, specifically the U.S.-made Tomahawk, used by the RN's nuclear submarine fleet. UK conventional warhead versions were first fired in combat by the RN in 1999, during the [[Kosovo War]] (the United States fired cruise missiles in 1991). The [[Royal Air Force]] uses the [[Storm Shadow]] cruise missile on its [[Tornado GR4]] aircraft. It is also used by France, where it is known as SCALP EG, and carried by the [[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'s [[Mirage 2000]] and [[Rafale]] aircraft.\n\nIndia and Russia have jointly developed the supersonic cruise missile [[BrahMos]]. There are three versions of the Brahmos: ship/land-launched, air-launched and sub-launched. The ship/land-launched version were operational as of late 2007.

In this short time frame, the Soviet Union was working on nearly ten different types of cruise missiles. However, due to resources, most of the initial types of cruise missiles developed by the Soviet Union were Sea- Launched Cruise Missiles or Submarine-Launched Cruise Missiles ([[Submarine-launched cruise missile|SLCM]]<nowiki/>s). The [[KSShch|SS-N-1]] cruise missile was developed to have different configurations to be fired from a submarine or a ship. However, as the time progressed, the Soviet Union began to work on air launched cruise missiles as well ([[Air-launched cruise missile|ALCM]]). These ACLM missiles were typically delivered via bombers designated as \"Blinders\" or \"Backfire\". The missiles in this configuration were called the AS-1, and AS-2 with eventual new variants with more development time. The main purpose of Soviet-based cruise missiles was to have defense and offensive mechanisms against enemy ships; in other words most of the Soviet cruise missiles were anti-ship missiles. the 1980s the Soviet Union had developed an arsenal of cruise missiles nearing 600 platforms which consisted of land, sea, and air delivery systems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arkin|first=William|date=May 1983|title=Soviet Cruise Missile Programs|journal=Arms Control Today|volume=13|issue=4|pages=3\u20134|jstor=23623103}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\n{{See also|United States and weapons of mass destruction}}\n[[File:Agm-129 acm.jpg|thumb|right|An [[AGM-129 ACM]] of the [[United States Air Force]]]]\n\nThe United States has deployed four nuclear cruise missiles at one time or another.\n*[[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] submarine-launched missile, out of service\n*[[AGM-86 ALCM]] air-launched cruise missile, 350 to 550 missiles and [[W80 (nuclear warhead)|W80]] warheads still in service\n*[[Tomahawk (missile)|BGM-109 Tomahawk]] cruise missile in nuclear submarine-, surface ship-, and ground-launched models, nuclear models out of service but warheads kept in reserve.\n*[[AGM-129 ACM]] Advanced Cruise missile, out of service<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tinker.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123299303 |title=Cruise missile career comes to a close |publisher=U.S. Air Force, Tinker Air Force Base public affairs |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220061518/http://www.tinker.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123299303 |archivedate=20 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Efficiency in modern warfare===\nCurrently cruise missiles are among the most expensive of single-use weapons, up to several million dollars apiece. One consequence of this is that its users face difficult choices in [[targeting (warfare)|target allocation]], to avoid expending the missiles on targets of low value. For instance, during [[Operation Enduring Freedom|the 2001 strikes on Afghanistan]] the United States attacked targets of very low monetary value with cruise missiles, which led many to question the efficiency of the weapon. However, proponents of the cruise missile counter that the same argument applies to other types of [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s: they are cheaper than human pilots when total training and infrastructure costs are taken into account, not to mention the risk of loss of personnel. As demonstrated in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn|Libya in 2011]] and prior conflicts, cruise missiles are much more difficult to detect and intercept than other aerial assets (reduced radar cross-section, infrared and visual signature due to smaller size), suiting them to attacks against static air defense systems.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Affordable Weapon System]]\n* [[Cruise missile submarine]]\n* [[Eugene Vielle]] (pioneer of technology that led to the Cruise missile)\n* [[Expendable launch system]]\n* [[List of cruise missiles]]\n* [[List of rocket aircraft]]\n* [[Lists of weapons]]\n* [[Low Cost Miniature Cruise Missile]]\n* [[NATO reporting name]] (has lists of various Soviet missiles)\n* [[Weapon of mass destruction]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons}}\n*[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA162646 The Evolution of the Cruise Missile by Werrell, Kenneth P.]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100815011742/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1981/jan-feb/werrell.htm The Cruise Missile: Precursors and Problems by Werrell, Kenneth P.]\n*[https://fas.org/nuke/intro/cm/index.html An introduction to cruise missiles]&nbsp;\u2014 From the website of the Federation of American Scientists (FAS)\n*[https://missilethreat.csis.org/ Missile Threat: A Project of the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]]]\n\n{{Missile types}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cruise Missile}}\n[[Category:Cruise missiles| ]]\n[[Category:Missile types]]\n", "name_user": "Natg 19", "label": "safe", "comment": "DisambiguateZarbtoZarb missileusingpopups", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile"}

It is fully recognised as part of the Anglican Communion and has around 3,000 members in its constituent orders. The society is made up of several distinct orders: the brothers of the First Order (Society of St Francis, SSF); the sisters of the First Order (Community of St Francis, CSF); the Sisters of the Second Order (Community of St Clare, OSC); the brothers and sisters of the Third Order (Third Order of St Francis, TSSF).<ref>\"The Society of Saint Francis - The Constitution\"</ref>\n\n[[Francis of Assisi]] and [[Clare of Assisi]], the founders of the Franciscan movement, produced separate rules for three parallel orders - the First Order were to be mendicant friars, embracing poverty as a gift from God and living community life in the world  by serving the poor. The Second Order were to be a parallel community of sisters living a more enclosed life of prayer and contemplation. The Third Order was to consist of brothers and sisters not living in community, nor under full monastic vows, but nevertheless taking simple promises and following a rule of life in the world. These three orders still co-exist as parts of the Franciscan family in Anglicanism as well as in other Christian denominations. Francis also wrote a rule for those wishing to follow the contemplative life (in the style of the Second Order), but living alone as Christian hermits.\n\nThe [[Society of St. Francis]] includes an order of tertiaries, people who have taken promises and are followers of a version of the Franciscan Rule but do not live together in community.<ref>''The Manual of the Third Order of the Society of Saint Francis; part 2: European Province.''

They are a Third Order society of Men and Women who live out of community. Currently this Order has members in the United States of America, Canada and Ireland.\n\n===First Order===\n{{Main|Society of St Francis|Community of St Francis}}\nFirst Order Franciscans live in community under traditional vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. In the Anglican Communion the male first order is known as the [[Society of St Francis]], and brothers have the initials 'SSF' after their name; the female first order is known as the [[Community of St Francis]], and sisters have the initials 'CSF' after their name. The First Order brothers and sisters operate worldwide, dividing themselves into internal provinces, and have around 200 members.\n\n===Second Order===\n{{Main|Community of St. Clare}}\nSecond Order Franciscans live in enclosed community, taking the same traditional vows but following a version of the Rule of St Francis modified to reflect a more contemplative lifestyle. Second Order sisters are often known as \"Poor Clares\", though they should properly be known as the Order of St Clare or the Community of St Clare. The sisters have the initials \"OSC\" after their names. They are the smallest part of the Franciscan family and are currently active only in the United Kingdom at St Mary's Convent, Freeland, Oxfordshire. The sisters believe that their \"enclosed\" life does not mean being \"shut in\", but rather an opportunity to live and work together on one site in real community.<ref>The community describes this on [http://oscfreeland.wordpress.com/the-community/ this webpage].</ref> The former second order convent in New York, opened in 1922, closed in 2003 following the death of the last sister of the [[Former religious orders in the Anglican Communion#Poor Clares of Reparation and Adoration (OSC)|Poor Clares of Reparation and Adoration (OSC)]].\n\n===Third Order===\nA Third Order of Saint Francis (TSSF), with the same name as the Catholic third order, exists in the [[Anglican Communion]], alongside the Anglican Society of St Francis and Community of St Francis (First Order Franciscans), and the [[Community of St. Clare]] (Anglican Second Order of Franciscan Sisters).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThird Order Franciscans live as a dispersed community, which means that they meet together regularly for prayer, study, and fellowship, but live individually on a day-to-day basis. Some live alone, others as part of a family. Members may be single or married, ordained or lay, and male or female. They do not take the traditional three-fold vow of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]], but they do enter into a binding promise and live by a rule of life based upon Francis of Assisi's original Third Order rule.\n\n===Other Franciscan orders===\nWhilst the Society of St Francis (First, Second and Third Orders), operating worldwide, is widely recognized as the principal branch of Franciscanism within the Anglican Communion, there are other religious orders following the Franciscan rule, and living the Franciscan life. Those that are officially recognized as part of the Anglican Communion include the following:\n\n'''First Order'''\n* The Korean Franciscan Brotherhood (KFB) is a First Order male community in formation in Korea, with assistance from the Society of St Francis. An SSF brother has headed the KFB since its formation in 1994, and by an agreement reached in 2001 will continue to support KFB in achieving full independence as an order.<ref>The agreement and history are outlined [http://communities.anglicancommunion.org/communities/detail.cfm?ID=61&types=byname here] at the Anglican Communion website.</ref> The brothers are building friaries and a retreat centre.[http://www.francis.or.kr]\n* The Sisters of St Francis (SSF) is a Korean community of First Order sisters living in a convent at [[Cheongwon County]], Korea. The sisters engage in community work and parish work within the Anglican Church of Korea.\n* The Society of the Franciscan Servants of Jesus and Mary (FSJM) is a community of women founded in 1935, and living in a convent at Posbury in Devon. The sisters accept guests for retreats and also have a small retreat cottage which is sometimes available for guests. The community is small in number, and has ceased much of its active community work.\n* The Daughters of St Francis is a community of women following the Franciscan rule in Korea.<ref>Details [http://communities.anglicancommunion.org/communities/detail.cfm?ID=58&types=byname here] on the Anglican Communion website.</ref>\n* The [[Former religious orders in the Anglican Communion#Order of St Elizabeth of Hungary|Order of St Elizabeth of Hungary]] was an early experiment in Franciscan First Order life for women, founded during the First World War and named after the Franciscan divine Elizabeth of Thuringia. Operating extensively in England and Australia, the society declined rapidly in the 1980s and closed in the 1990s.\n\n'''Second Order and hermitage'''\n* The [[Little Brothers of Francis]] (LBF) is a small Australian community of men, whose three founders were First Order brothers (SSF) who felt called to a more individual and contemplative life. They live according to the Rule of St Francis for Hermitages, and thus bring a further dimension to the Franciscan family within Anglicanism.\n* The [[Little Sisters of Saint Clare]] (LSSC)[https://web.archive.org/web/20100902173451/http://www.stclarelittlesisters.org/] is a fresh expression of the Second Order rule founded in 2002. The sisters wear traditional habit and follow the contemplative life, but they currently live as a dispersed community (though with regular Chapter meetings) pending the funds to establish a physical convent.\n* The [[Society of Our Lady of the Isles]] (SOLI) is a contemplative community living on [[Fetlar]], an island in Shetland (Scotland), according to a hybrid rule derived from a blending of the Franciscan Second Order rule and the Cistercian rule. Oblate sisters live enclosed within the community, whilst fully professed sisters live as solitary sisters, engaging with community activities at prescribed times.\n\n'''Third Order'''\n* The Company of Jesus is an unusual order in two respects. Firstly, it is a deliberate mix of the Franciscan and Benedictine rules, forming a \"hybrid\" community. Secondly, although it is a Third Order movement, it bears many of the characters of the First Order. The members spend large amounts of time in community in traditional habit and the order maintains a residential monastery (Livingstone Monastery in Virginia) where members may live the monastic life, despite their Third Order status.\n\n'''The Order of Saint Francis'''\n*The '''Order of Saint Francis (OSF)''' is an active, Apostolic Christian religious order within the Franciscan tradition.  The OSF admits members of the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] Communion (and churches in [[full communion]]).  Rather than living in an enclosed communal setting, OSF brothers live independently in different parts of the world, with ministries based on the needs of their local communities.  Members are baptized men who have been confirmed within the Anglican Communion, and who voluntarily commit to living by a set of vows for a term of years or for life.  The Order of Saint Francis is a dispersed order, which welcomes men with dual vocations (clergy as well as lay).  Brothers may also be married or single and can be found in the United States, Canada, and Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.osffranciscans.com/faq.htm|title=Order of Saint Francis|website=Order of Saint Francis|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref> The acceptance of married men has necessitated changes to the traditional vows, particularly those of chastity and poverty.

The Third Order was to consist of brothers and sisters not living in community, nor under full monastic vows, but nevertheless taking simple promises and following a rule of life in the world. These three orders still co-exist as parts of the Franciscan family in Anglicanism as well as in other Christian denominations. Francis also wrote a rule for those wishing to follow the contemplative life (in the style of the Second Order), but living alone as Christian hermits.\n\nThe [[Society of St. Francis]] includes an order of tertiaries, people who have taken promises and are followers of a version of the Franciscan Rule but do not live together in community.<ref>''The Manual of the Third Order of the Society of Saint Francis; part 2: European Province.''

They are a Third Order society of Men and Women who live out of community. Currently this Order has members in the United States of America, Canada and Ireland.\n\n===First Order===\n{{Main|Society of St Francis|Community of St Francis}}\nFirst Order Franciscans live in community under traditional vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. In the Anglican Communion the male first order is known as the [[Society of St Francis]], and brothers have the initials 'SSF' after their name; the female first order is known as the [[Community of St Francis]], and sisters have the initials 'CSF' after their name. The First Order brothers and sisters operate worldwide, dividing themselves into internal provinces, and have around 200 members.\n\n===Second Order===\n{{Main|Community of St. Clare}}\nSecond Order Franciscans live in enclosed community, taking the same traditional vows but following a version of the Rule of St Francis modified to reflect a more contemplative lifestyle. Second Order sisters are often known as \"Poor Clares\", though they should properly be known as the Order of St Clare or the Community of St Clare. The sisters have the initials \"OSC\" after their names. They are the smallest part of the Franciscan family and are currently active only in the United Kingdom at St Mary's Convent, Freeland, Oxfordshire. The sisters believe that their \"enclosed\" life does not mean being \"shut in\", but rather an opportunity to live and work together on one site in real community.<ref>The community describes this on [http://oscfreeland.wordpress.com/the-community/ this webpage].</ref> The former second order convent in New York, opened in 1922, closed in 2003 following the death of the last sister of the [[Former religious orders in the Anglican Communion#Poor Clares of Reparation and Adoration (OSC)|Poor Clares of Reparation and Adoration (OSC)]].\n\n===Third Order===\nA Third Order of Saint Francis (TSSF), with the same name as the Catholic third order, exists in the [[Anglican Communion]], alongside the Anglican Society of St Francis and Community of St Francis (First Order Franciscans), and the [[Community of St. Clare]] (Anglican Second Order of Franciscan Sisters).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThird Order Franciscans live as a dispersed community, which means that they meet together regularly for prayer, study, and fellowship, but live individually on a day-to-day basis. Some live alone, others as part of a family. Members may be single or married, ordained or lay, and male or female. They do not take the traditional three-fold vow of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]], but they do enter into a binding promise and live by a rule of life based upon Francis of Assisi's original Third Order rule.\n\n===Other Franciscan orders===\nWhilst the Society of St Francis (First, Second and Third Orders), operating worldwide, is widely recognized as the principal branch of Franciscanism within the Anglican Communion, there are other religious orders following the Franciscan rule, and living the Franciscan life. Those that are officially recognized as part of the Anglican Communion include the following:\n\n'''First Order'''\n* The Korean Franciscan Brotherhood (KFB) is a First Order male community in formation in Korea, with assistance from the Society of St Francis. An SSF brother has headed the KFB since its formation in 1994, and by an agreement reached in 2001 will continue to support KFB in achieving full independence as an order.<ref>The agreement and history are outlined [http://communities.anglicancommunion.org/communities/detail.cfm?ID=61&types=byname here] at the Anglican Communion website.</ref> The brothers are building friaries and a retreat centre.[http://www.francis.or.kr]\n* The Sisters of St Francis (SSF) is a Korean community of First Order sisters living in a convent at [[Cheongwon County]], Korea. The sisters engage in community work and parish work within the Anglican Church of Korea.\n* The Society of the Franciscan Servants of Jesus and Mary (FSJM) is a community of women founded in 1935, and living in a convent at Posbury in Devon. The sisters accept guests for retreats and also have a small retreat cottage which is sometimes available for guests. The community is small in number, and has ceased much of its active community work.\n* The Daughters of St Francis is a community of women following the Franciscan rule in Korea.<ref>Details [http://communities.anglicancommunion.org/communities/detail.cfm?ID=58&types=byname here] on the Anglican Communion website.</ref>\n* The [[Former religious orders in the Anglican Communion#Order of St Elizabeth of Hungary|Order of St Elizabeth of Hungary]] was an early experiment in Franciscan First Order life for women, founded during the First World War and named after the Franciscan divine Elizabeth of Thuringia. Operating extensively in England and Australia, the society declined rapidly in the 1980s and closed in the 1990s.\n\n'''Second Order and hermitage'''\n* The [[Little Brothers of Francis]] (LBF) is a small Australian community of men, whose three founders were First Order brothers (SSF) who felt called to a more individual and contemplative life. They live according to the Rule of St Francis for Hermitages, and thus bring a further dimension to the Franciscan family within Anglicanism.\n* The [[Little Sisters of Saint Clare]] (LSSC)[https://web.archive.org/web/20100902173451/http://www.stclarelittlesisters.org/] is a fresh expression of the Second Order rule founded in 2002. The sisters wear traditional habit and follow the contemplative life, but they currently live as a dispersed community (though with regular Chapter meetings) pending the funds to establish a physical convent.\n* The [[Society of Our Lady of the Isles]] (SOLI) is a contemplative community living on [[Fetlar]], an island in Shetland (Scotland), according to a hybrid rule derived from a blending of the Franciscan Second Order rule and the Cistercian rule. Oblate sisters live enclosed within the community, whilst fully professed sisters live as solitary sisters, engaging with community activities at prescribed times.\n\n'''Third Order'''\n* The Company of Jesus is an unusual order in two respects. Firstly, it is a deliberate mix of the Franciscan and Benedictine rules, forming a \"hybrid\" community. Secondly, although it is a Third Order movement, it bears many of the characters of the First Order. The members spend large amounts of time in community in traditional habit and the order maintains a residential monastery (Livingstone Monastery in Virginia) where members may live the monastic life, despite their Third Order status.\n\n'''The Order of Saint Francis'''\n*The '''Order of Saint Francis (OSF)''' is an active, Apostolic Christian religious order within the Franciscan tradition.  The OSF admits members of the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] Communion (and churches in [[full communion]]).  Rather than living in an enclosed communal setting, OSF brothers live independently in different parts of the world, with ministries based on the needs of their local communities.  Members are baptized men who have been confirmed within the Anglican Communion, and who voluntarily commit to living by a set of vows for a term of years or for life.  The Order of Saint Francis is a dispersed order, which welcomes men with dual vocations (clergy as well as lay).  Brothers may also be married or single and can be found in the United States, Canada, and Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.osffranciscans.com/faq.htm|title=Order of Saint Francis|website=Order of Saint Francis|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref> The acceptance of married men has necessitated changes to the traditional vows, particularly those of chastity and poverty.

The CFC seeks to follow Jesus in the footsteps of [[Saint Francis of Assisi|Francis]] and [[Clare of Assisi|Clare]] by living simply and humbly, serving and praying with and for the marginalized members of the communities they live in and by helping to re-build the church in their contexts. As a contemporary expression of the Franciscan tradition, members \u2013 lay and clergy, partnered or single- live individually, in common or with their families and support themselves through secular or church-related employment. The members of the CFC vow poverty, chastity and obedience seeking to place these evangelical counsels into a [https://cfcfranciscans.org/new-page contemporary expression] (simplicity, fidelity, humility).

Charlie is on the run on a floating circus, with six lions in tow, aiming to return them to the wild of Morocco and to rescue his parents who have been kidnapped by a sinister corporation known as the Corporacy\n\nThe first book is known simply as ''Lionboy''. The sequel, ''Lionboy: The Chase'', continues the story of Charlie and the lions, with most of the story set in Venice. It was published by Puffin in the summer of 2004. The final instalment of the trilogy, ''Lionboy: The Truth'', concludes the story and was published in January 2006. I like cat wet\n\n==Setting==\n\nThe series is set at an unspecified time in the Earth's future. The world in the books mostly resembles the modern day world, with a few key differences. These differences are hinted at rather than explained outright. Firstly, most of the world's oil has been used up, and petrol cars are now only used by the very rich, elite and powerful. [[Aeroplanes]] are not flown at all \u2013 sea travel is once again the dominant form of overseas travel.

Charlie, closely avoiding being kidnapped himself, sets out to find them and ends up on board Circe, a [[circus]] ship making its way to Paris. On board he befriends most of the circus performers as well as (using the ability) a pride of beautiful performing lions who seek the boy's help to escape their cruel trainer, Maccomo. Meanwhile, the vicious criminal Rafi Sadler, who is employed by the Corporacy, is hot on his heels, going to any lengths to get his hands on Charlie. The circus ship arrives in Paris and Charlie escapes with the lions. They make their way to [[Gare d'Austerlitz]] where they hide on the Orient Express which is destined for [[Venice]], the place Charlie's parents are rumoured to have been taken.\n\nWhile traversing from the Circe to the train station, Charlie and the lions meet a strange and mysterious lion-like creature.

Charlie is on the run on a floating circus, with six lions in tow, aiming to return them to the wild of Morocco and to rescue his parents who have been kidnapped by a sinister corporation known as the Corporacy\n\nThe first book is known simply as ''Lionboy''. The sequel, ''Lionboy: The Chase'', continues the story of Charlie and the lions, with most of the story set in Venice. It was published by Puffin in the summer of 2004. The final instalment of the trilogy, ''Lionboy: The Truth'', concludes the story and was published in January 2006.\n\n==Setting==\n\nThe series is set at an unspecified time in the Earth's future. The world in the books mostly resembles the modern day world, with a few key differences. These differences are hinted at rather than explained outright. Firstly, most of the world's oil has been used up, and petrol cars are now only used by the very rich, elite and powerful. [[Aeroplanes]] are not flown at all \u2013 sea travel is once again the dominant form of overseas travel. The world (at least, the parts seen in Charlie's journey) now seems to run efficiently on solar and wind power.\n\nThe major world superpower in the series is known only as the Empire, and the text contains hints that this is actually the United States.
