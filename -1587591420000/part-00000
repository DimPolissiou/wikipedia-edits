Subsequently, these soldiers, stationed in [[Arlon]], wore the wild boar (emblem of the [[Ardennes]]) on their green berets. One regiment was not enough to hold the east lines, so in August 1934, the regiment was divided into three and a bicycle battalion was added. On 24 March 1937, three regiments were created: 1st, 2nd and 3rd ''R\u00e9giment des Chasseurs Ardennais'' they were located in Arlon, [[Bastogne]] and [[Vielsalm]]. Each unit was structured with one HQ battalion, three battalions to three companies of mixed cyclists (three ''packs'' of riflemen and three packs of MG) one motorcycle company each with each three motorbike squadrons, and one squadron with three [[Belgian combat vehicles of World War II#T15 light tank|T-15 tanks]]; one company with four [[T-13 tank destroyer|T-13 tanks]] armed with 47mm antitank cannons; and finally one medical company. On July 1, 1939, these were formed into a division. Following the [[mobilization]] of the Belgian Army in late 1939 this division comprised 35,000 men, and a second division of three more regiments was created.\n\n===Second World War===\nIn the [[Second World War]], the ''Chasseurs Ardennais'' took part in heavy fighting after Belgium was [[Battle of Belgium|invaded]] on 10 May 1940; the Germans noted the fierce resistance of the Belgians and the ''Chasseurs Ardennais'' were no exception.

[[Wuhan]], the capital of [[Hubei]] province, China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite

[[Mimis Pierrakos]] was killed during the war (later, during the 1950s, his bones were transferred from Albania back to Athens).

That same year, Vangelis Panakis and [[Kostas Linoxilakis]] came to the club and quickly became the side's new star players. Panathinaikos was again champion for the [[1952\u201353 Panhellenic Championship]].\n\nUntil 1959, the team had also won seven of the last eight [[Athens Football Clubs Association|Athens Championships]], the regional championships organised in Greece. In 1959, [[Mimis Domazos]], the emblematic captain of the team, made his first appearance with Panathinaikos and the same year took place the first season under the new system of Alpha Ethniki ([[1959\u201360 Alpha Ethniki]]).

Moreover, the team won two more Greek Cups, in [[1966\u201367 Greek Cup|1967]] and [[1968\u201369 Greek Cup|1969]]. Also, during these years, a long process of rejuvenation took place in the club. Notable players retired, such as Panakis, Linoxilakis, [[Takis Loukanidis]] and [[Andreas Papaemmanouil]], and the team had to count on young players like Domazos, [[Antonis Antoniadis]], [[Anthimos Kapsis]], [[Kostas Eleftherakis]] and [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]].\n\n[[Stjepan Bobek]] was the main contributor to this process.

The stadium is located on [[Alexandras Avenue]] and is most commonly referred to as ''Leoforos'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for \"Avenue\"). It is considered one of the most historic stadiums in Greece, as it was used by the [[Greece national football team|Greek national team]] as home ground for many years (most recently for the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] qualifying matches) and even by Panathinaikos' biggest rivals, [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], on various occasions.\n\nPanathinaikos left ''Leoforos'' in 1984 to play in the newly-built [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]]. In 2000, then-club president Angelos Filippidis announced a return to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, following a \u20ac7 million renovation. Capacity was reduced from 25,000 to 16,620, new dressing rooms were built and modular stand roofing was added in compliance with [[UEFA]] requirements, but in 2004, stricter standards were announced and the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium would need further expansion were it to remain suitable for UEFA-sanctioned matches. This was precluded by local zoning regulations and the team had to return to the Olympic Stadium once more until a new stadium, the proposed [[Votanikos Arena]], was built. The ''Leoforos'' ground was due for demolition.\n\nOn 27 January 2007, the board of Panathinaikos decided to reuse the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium for the team's 2007\u201308 domestic league and UEFA Cup home games. Additionally, the club officials decided to install new lawn, new seats and upgrade the press conference room and the restrooms.\n\nAs of October 2013, and due to the club's and the country's financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium have been put on hold. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again.\n\nThe current president of the club, [[Giannis Alafouzos]], declared his intention for another renovation of the stadium and the capacity increase, while the [[Panathinaikos Movement]] made its propositions for a total reconstruction.\n\nIn 2019 the owner of Panathinaikos basketball team presented a funding plan for the construction of  the new football and basketball stadiums of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]] \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

That same year, the [[Panathinaikos F.C.

In 2013, was decided the move of the club from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the team. Located in the area of [[Koropi]], [[Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center]] became a new training ground and Academy base of Panathinaikos.\n\n==Financial information==\nUntil 1979, football in Greece was still in amateur level. The team, such as the other departments of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]], depended on the financial support of the club's members, while the president (responsible for all athletic departments) was elected by the Board members. In 1979, the Greek football turned professional and the Vardinogiannis family purchased the football department. [[Yiorgos Vardinogiannis|Giorgos Vardinogiannis]] became the new president.<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> Vardinogiannis family were the owners of the club the next decades.\n\nOn 22 April 2008, and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50%\u2014after 30 years of full ownership\u2014through a \u20ac80 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% (as before) and the new shareholders 34%. [[Pavlos Giannakopoulos]], [[Nikos Pateras]], [[Adamantios Polemis]] and [[Andreas Vgenopoulos (businessman)|Andreas Vgenopoulos]] were the main investors, plus other minor shareholders. Nikos Pateras was selected to be the new president.\n\nIn 2011, due to financial problems and management disagreements, the direction decided to reduce the budget and sell many players. In 2012, the owner of [[Skai TV]], [[Giannis Alafouzos]], devised a plan to take Vardinogiannis' shares (54.7%) and make them available to fans around Greece so that everyone could contribute, so that Panathinaikos could overcome the crisis.<ref name=\"alafouzos1\"/> His intention was to create a new, for the Greek athletic standards, [[List of fan-owned sports teams|supporter-owned football club]]. On 2 July 2012, the '''Panathenaic Alliance''' finally opened to the public so that everyone could be a member and contribute a desired amount in return for privileges. A few days later, Giannis Vardinogiannis gave his shares\u201454.7% of Panathinaikos\u2014to the Alliance, while the other shareholders maintained their percentage. The members of the Alliance through elections compose the Board of Directors and elect the club's president. The first president elected was [[Giannis Alafouzos]]. In 2013, was decided the move of the team from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the club.

Messaris, who scored again three goals, became a hero and chant for the fans.\n\n=== Crisis and WWII years ===\nIn 1931, a serious disagreement between leading board member [[Apostolos Nikolaidis (athlete)|Apostolos Nikolaidis]] from one side, and some players (most notably [[Angelos Messaris]]) and club's officials on the other side,<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> regarding the [[professionalization]] in the [[Football in Greece|Greek football]], which lasted two years, damaged the club and led to a counterproductive period. In the meantime, the HFF [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] had commenced in 1932. The last bright moment for the Greens before World War II was winning the Cup for the first time in 1940 against Aris, 3\u20131.\n\nIn 1940, with the break out of the [[Greco-Italian War]], many players of the club joined the [[Hellenic Army]]. [[Mimis Pierrakos]] was killed during the war (later, during the 1950s, his bones were transferred from Albania back to Athens). During the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] from 1941 to 1944, many players of the team became members of [[United Panhellenic Organization of Youth]] (PEAN) resistance organization.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xyzcontagion.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/podosfairo-polemos-katoxi-emfylios |title=Football during the War |website=Xyzcontagion.wordpress.com  |language=Greek }}</ref> while [[Michalis Papazoglou]] had a leading role in the resistance group of [[Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz]].\n\nAfter this long crisis period, Panathinaikos had to wait until 1949 to win again a Greek Championship under the guidance of the Austrian coach [[Johann Strnad]]. That same year, Vangelis Panakis and [[Kostas Linoxilakis]] came to the club and quickly became the side's new star players. Panathinaikos was again champion for the [[1952\u201353 Panhellenic Championship]].\n\nUntil 1959, the team had also won seven of the last eight [[Athens Football Clubs Association|Athens Championships]], the regional championships organised in Greece. In 1959, [[Mimis Domazos]], the emblematic captain of the team, made his first appearance with Panathinaikos and the same year took place the first season under the new system of Alpha Ethniki ([[1959\u201360 Alpha Ethniki]]). Panathinaikos was the champion team.\n\n=== 1960s: The Golden Decade, the Bobek's rejuvenation ===\nDuring the next years, Panathinaikos were again champions in [[1960\u201361 Alpha Ethniki|1961]], [[1961\u201362 Alpha Ethniki|1962]], [[1963\u201364 Alpha Ethniki|1964]], [[1964\u201365 Alpha Ethniki|1965]], [[1968\u201369 Alpha Ethniki|1969]] and [[1969\u201370 Alpha Ethniki|1970]]. Moreover, the team won two more Greek Cups, in [[1966\u201367 Greek Cup|1967]] and [[1968\u201369 Greek Cup|1969]]. Also, during these years, a long process of rejuvenation took place in the club. Notable players retired, such as Panakis, Linoxilakis, [[Takis Loukanidis]] and [[Andreas Papaemmanouil]], and the team had to count on young players like Domazos, [[Antonis Antoniadis]], [[Anthimos Kapsis]], [[Kostas Eleftherakis]] and [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]].\n\n[[Stjepan Bobek]] was the main contributor to this process. In 1963, he became the club's head coach, changing the playing style of the team to a 4\u20133\u20133 and created a new team based on young players (the \"Bobek's rejuvenation\"). Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the Championship of 1964 without a loss, making them one of the two teams that has won the Greek Championship (with its modern system) undefeated.<ref name=\"paohistory2\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229045544/http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archivedate=29 December 2015\n |title=History\n |website=Pao.gr\n |accessdate=23 June 2011\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref> Notable players of the team included Panakis, Domazos, [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]], [[Totis Filakouris]], [[Frangiskos Sourpis]] and [[Aristidis Kamaras]].\n\nWith the establishment of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military regime]], the president of the club, [[Loukas Panourgias]], was forced out of the presidency.

The stadium is located on [[Alexandras Avenue]] and is most commonly referred to as ''Leoforos'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for \"Avenue\"). It is considered one of the most historic stadiums in Greece, as it was used by the [[Greece national football team|Greek national team]] as home ground for many years (most recently for the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] qualifying matches) and even by Panathinaikos' biggest rivals, [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], on various occasions.\n\nPanathinaikos left ''Leoforos'' in 1984 to play in the newly-built [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]]. In 2000, then-club president Angelos Filippidis announced a return to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, following a \u20ac7 million renovation. Capacity was reduced from 25,000 to 16,620, new dressing rooms were built and modular stand roofing was added in compliance with [[UEFA]] requirements, but in 2004, stricter standards were announced and the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium would need further expansion were it to remain suitable for UEFA-sanctioned matches. This was precluded by local zoning regulations and the team had to return to the Olympic Stadium once more until a new stadium, the proposed [[Votanikos Arena]], was built. The ''Leoforos'' ground was due for demolition.\n\nOn 27 January 2007, the board of Panathinaikos decided to reuse the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium for the team's 2007\u201308 domestic league and UEFA Cup home games. Additionally, the club officials decided to install new lawn, new seats and upgrade the press conference room and the restrooms.\n\nAs of October 2013, and due to the club's and the country's financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium have been put on hold. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again.\n\nThe current president of the club, [[Giannis Alafouzos]], declared his intention for another renovation of the stadium and the capacity increase, while the [[Panathinaikos Movement]] made its propositions for a total reconstruction.\n\nIn 2019 the owner of Panathinaikos basketball team presented a funding plan for the construction of  the new football and basketball stadiums of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]] \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

In 2013, was decided the move of the club from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the team. Located in the area of [[Koropi]], [[Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center]] became a new training ground and Academy base of Panathinaikos.\n\n==Financial information==\nUntil 1979, football in Greece was still in amateur level. The team, such as the other departments of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]], depended on the financial support of the club's members, while the president (responsible for all athletic departments) was elected by the Board members. In 1979, the Greek football turned professional and the Vardinogiannis family purchased the football department. [[Yiorgos Vardinogiannis|Giorgos Vardinogiannis]] became the new president.<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> Vardinogiannis family were the owners of the club the next decades.\n\nOn 22 April 2008, and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50%\u2014after 30 years of full ownership\u2014through a \u20ac80 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% (as before) and the new shareholders 34%.
