After playing for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Chicago White Sox]], Sosa joined the Cubs in 1992 and became regarded as one of the game's best hitters. Sosa hit his 400th home run in his 1,354th game and his 5,273rd at-bat, reaching this milestone quicker than any player in [[National League]] history. He is one of nine players in MLB history to hit 600 career home runs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/sortable.jsp?c_id=mlb#elem=%5Bobject+Object%5D&tab_level=child&click_text=Sortable+Player+hitting&sectionType=sp&statType=hitting&page=1&ts=1529343009753&sortColumn=hr&sortOrder='desc'&extended=0&split=&season=2018&game_type='R'&playerType=ALL&timeframe=&season_type=ALL&league_code='MLB'|title=Sortable Player Stats|website=Major League Baseball|language=en|access-date=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Sosa and [[Mark McGwire]] achieved national fame for their [[home run]]-hitting prowess in pursuit of [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|Roger Maris' home run record]].

He also struck out 150 times, fourth most in the American League. Sosa started the 1991 season by hitting 2 home runs and driving in 5 runs. However, he would slump for the rest of the year and ended up batting .203 with 10 home runs and 33 runs batted in.\n\n===Chicago Cubs (1992&ndash;2004)===\nThe White Sox traded Sosa and [[Ken Patterson]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[outfielder]] [[George Bell (outfielder)|George Bell]] before the 1992 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/01/03/score-20-flashback-1-white-sox-trade-sosa-to-cubs-for-bell/|title=Flashback #1: White Sox Trade Sosa To Cubs For Bell (1992)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSosa batted .260 with 8 home runs and 25 RBIs in his first season with the Cubs. Although not spectacular numbers, it showed that Sosa improved as a hitter. In 1993, Sosa batted .261 with 33 [[home runs]] with 93 RBIs. He also showed his speed by stealing 38 bases. He became the Cubs' first 30-30 player in their history. Sosa continued to hit for power and speed in 1994 but he also improved his batting average. He ended up batting .300 with 25 home runs, 70 RBIs, and 22 [[stolen bases]].\n\nSosa was named to his first All-Star team in 1995. In 144 games, he batted .268 with 36 home runs and 119 RBIs. Sosa continued his success with the Cubs in 1996 as he batted .273 with 40 home runs and 100 RBIs. However, the next year, Sosa struggled. Despite hitting 36 home runs with 119 RBIs, Sosa batted just .251. He struggled to get on base(.300 on-base percentage) and led the league in strikeouts with 174.\n\nAfter years as a respected power/speed threat with a rocket arm in right field, he emerged during the 1998 season as one of baseball's greatest. It was in this season that both Sosa and [[Mark McGwire]] were involved in the \"[[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|home run record chase]]\", when both players' prowess for hitting [[home run]]s drew national attention as they attempted to pass [[Roger Maris]]' single season home run mark of 61 home runs that had stood since 1961. For the early months of the year, Sosa trailed McGwire significantly, being as many as 16 homers behind at one point in May. But as the chase progressed, Sosa would rally and eventually tie McGwire with 46 home runs each on August 10, after a couple months of straggling within a few homers for the lead. However, the moment was short lived as McGwire would pull away slightly and reach 62 home runs to break the record first on September 8, but once again Sosa would excitingly heat up the race by tying McGwire once again at 62 on September 13. Eleven days later, with two games left to play in the season, the two were tied at 66 home runs each. Sosa would end the season with 66 after playing both games without a home run(still a team record), just behind McGwire's 70 after hitting two home runs in each of the last two games. However, Sammy had become the first Major League batter ever to hit 66 home runs in a season. It was during that season, that Cubs announcer [[Chip Caray]] nicknamed him \"'''Slammin' Sammy'''\", a nickname that quickly spread. In addition, Sammy produced then career highs in batting average and slugging percentage, at .308 and .647 respectively. Sosa also led the league in [[RBI]]s and runs scored. [[File:Sosa cubs jersey.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Sosa wore #21 with the Cubs in honor of his childhood idol [[Roberto Clemente]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cunniff | first = Bill | title = Sosa plays host at party at his island mansion | page = 3 | work = Chicago Sun-Times | date = November 26, 1999 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB424463A5BF794&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | accessdate = October 4, 2008 }}</ref>]]  Also in 1998, Sosa's 416 total bases were the most in a single season since [[Stan Musial]]'s 429 in 1948. Sosa's performance in the month of June, during which Sosa belted 20 home runs, knocked in 47 runs, and posted an .842 [[slugging percentage]], was one of the greatest offensive outbursts in major league history. Sosa won the [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|National League Most Valuable Player Award]] for leading the Cubs into the playoffs in 1998, earning every first-place vote except for the two cast by [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] writers, who voted for McGwire. He and McGwire shared ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's 1998 \"[[Sportsman of the Year]]\" award. Sosa was honored with a [[ticker-tape parade]] in his honor in New York City, and he was invited to be a guest at US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1999 [[State of the Union Address]]. 1998 was also the first time the Cubs made the post-season since 1989. The Cubs qualified as the NL Wild Card team, but were swept by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1998 National League Division Series#Atlanta Braves vs. Chicago Cubs|NLDS]].\n\nIn the 1999 season, Sosa hit 63 home runs, again trailing Mark McGwire, who hit 65. In the 2000 season, Sosa led the league by hitting 50 home runs. He received the [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading MLB in homers.<ref>{{cite news |last=MacMullan |first=Jackie |title=A bronze homage to Babe |date=October 17, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=E3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/214273981.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+17%2C+2002&author=JACKIE+MACMULLAN&pub=Boston+Globe&desc=A+BRONZE+HOMAGE+TO+BABE&pqatl=google |access-date=November 8, 2011 |quote=By 2001, they were paying their own way to present Sammy Sosa with his Babe Ruth Award.}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, he hit 64 home runs, becoming the first player to hit 60 home runs in three seasons in his career. However, he did not lead the league in any of those seasons; in 2001, he finished behind [[Barry Bonds]], who hit 73 homers, breaking the single-season home run record set by McGwire in 1998 (70). In the same season he set personal records in [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored (146), [[Run batted in|RBI]] (160), [[Base on balls|walks]] (116), [[on-base percentage]] (.437), [[slugging percentage]] (.737), and [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (.328).<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" /> He led the majors in runs and RBI, was 2nd in home runs, 2nd in slugging percentage, 1st in total bases, 3rd in walks, 4th in on-base percentage, 12th in batting average, and 15th in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. He also surpassed his 1998 number in total bases, racking up 425. Sosa once again led the league in home runs with 49 in 2002. Known as a free-swinger in his early years, and as a good [[strikeout]] candidate, Sammy became an effective hitter for average. He owns numerous team records for the Cubs, and he holds the major-league record for the most home runs hit in a month (20, in June 1998). In recognition of his accomplishments as a hitter, Sosa won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] (an award for offensive output, voted on by managers and coaches) in 1995 and in 1998 through 2002.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\n{{anchor|Corked bat incident}}\nIn 2003, the Cubs won the National League Central Division title. The year was not all good news for Sosa, however. In May, he spent his first period on the [[disabled list]] since 1996 after having an injured toenail removed. On June 3, 2003, Sosa was ejected from a Chicago Cubs-[[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] game in the first inning when umpires discovered he had been using a [[corked bat]].<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2003/0603/1562772.html Sosa ejected after cork is found in shattered bat.] (June 4, 2003) ESPN.com.

He sneezed very violently, causing severe back pain. He was diagnosed with back spasms and placed on the disabled list. Later, he fell into one of the worst slumps of his career, only snapping out of it during the last week of the season. He was greatly depressed when the officials told him he couldn't play. He finished with 35 homers, far below his numbers of his best years.  In his final 10 years with the Cubs he clubbed 479 home runs; the most in history over a 10-year span. The final straw for the Cubs was an incident in late 2004. Sosa requested to sit out the last game of the season, which was at home against the [[Atlanta Braves]], and he left [[Wrigley Field]] early in the game. It was his last time in a Cubs uniform.\n\n===Baltimore Orioles and year off (2005&ndash;2006)===\n[[File:Sosa Spring training.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Sosa in spring training with the Orioles in 2005]]\nOn January 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Sosa to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in exchange for [[infielder]]-outfielder [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]], infielder [[Mike Fontenot]], and RHP Dave Crouthers. To facilitate the deal, Sosa and his [[sports agent|agent]] agreed to waive the clause that guaranteed his 2006 salary, and the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]] indicated it would not object to that agreement. Under the deal, Sosa earned $17.875&nbsp;million for the 2005 season, with the Cubs paying $7&nbsp;million of his salary. By playing for the 2005 Orioles alongside fellow 500-home-run batter [[Rafael Palmeiro]], Sosa and Palmeiro became the first [[500 home run club]] members in history to play together on the same team after reaching the 500 home run plateau.{{efn|[[Hank Aaron]] reached 500 homers shortly after his teammate [[Eddie Mathews]] (512 homers) retired.|group=lower-alpha}}\n\nSosa finished the 2005 season batting .221 with 14 home runs, his worst performance since 1992, and continuing his post-2001 trend of declines in batting average, homers, total bases, and RBI. On December 7, 2005, the Orioles decided not to offer him an arbitration contract, effectively ending his Baltimore Orioles tenure and making him a free agent.\n\nIn 2005, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' published an update of their 1999 book ''Baseball's 100 Greatest Players''. Sosa did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher, he was ranked at Number 95. During a stretch of nine consecutive years, Sosa hit 35 or more home runs and 100+ RBIs, all with the Chicago Cubs.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\nAt the end of January 2006, the [[Washington Nationals]] offered Sosa two different minor-league offers, both of which he turned down. On February 15, 2006, Sosa's agent [[Adam Katz]] stated: \"We're not going to put him on the retirement list. We decided that [not putting him on that list] was the best thing to do. But I can say, with reasonable certainty, that we've seen Sammy in a baseball uniform for the last time.\"<ref>Jayson Stark (February 16, 2006).

This was the same contract that Sosa turned down the previous year from the Nationals.

He started the 2007 season as the Rangers' designated hitter and occasional right fielder.\nAt the same time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's number 21 to new pitcher [[Jason Marquis]], who coincidentally served up Sosa's 600th career home run. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111,CST-SPT-deluca22.article|title=Sosa's 21 a long-distance number|last=DeLuca|first=Chris|date=February 22, 2007|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 4, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014727/http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111%2CCST-SPT-deluca22.article|archivedate=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn April 26, 2007, Sosa made history by hitting a home run in his 45th major league ballpark.

Sosa became only the fifth man in history, following [[Babe Ruth]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Hank Aaron]], and [[Barry Bonds]], to hit 600 regular season home runs. The home run was the first one that Sosa had recorded against the Cubs, and as a result he has hit a home run against every active MLB team.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2911022 | title=Sosa becomes fifth player to blast 600 home runs | work=Associated Press | publisher=ESPN | date=June 20, 2007 | accessdate=June 19, 2017}}</ref> Sosa is the Cubs' all-time home run leader, having hit 545 with that team.\n\nOn May 28, 2008, Sosa announced that he instructed his agent not to offer his services to any MLB team for the 2008 season, and planned on filing for retirement, but never did.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3415614|title=Sosa not pursuing MLB job, says he intends to retire in 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2008 |work=ESPN.com|publisher= |date= }}</ref>\n\nOn December 25, 2008, Sosa announced he intended to unretire and play in the [[World Baseball Classic]] and once again test the free agent market in hopes of signing with a Major League ballclub in 2009.

However, he was not selected as part of the Dominican Republic's roster.  He remained a free agent and did not actively look for a team.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Sosa announced his intention to retire from baseball.

A candidate remains eligible for inclusion on subsequent ballots as long as he receives a minimum of 5.0% of the vote from the BBWAA.\n\nOn October 2, 2016 at a press conference at [[Fenway Park]], MLB Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]] said that anonymous drug tests from 2003 were inconclusive because \"it was hard to distinguish between certain substances that were legal, available over the counter, and not banned under our program.\"<ref name=\"espn.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/17706532/david-ortiz-says-did-wrong-03-failed-drug-test|title=Manfred: Possible Ortiz was PED-free in '03|publisher=}}</ref> Manfred argued that \"it was important to make people understand that even if your name was on that list, that it was entirely possible that you were not a positive\".<ref name=\"vocativ.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vocativ.com/364281/david-ortiz-retirement/|title=David Ortiz Gets A Steroid Hall Pass From MLB's Commissioner|date=October 3, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> Furthermore, Manfred sustained that the 2003 test was supposed to be confidential and it would be unfair to judge players based on \"leaks, rumors, innuendo, [and] not confirmed positive test results\".<ref name=\"espn.com\"/> Manfred finished by stating that Hall of Fame voters should use their best judgment and only consider confirmed testing by the MLB as there were many \"legitimate scientific questions about whether or not those were truly positives.\"<ref name=\"vocativ.com\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nSosa is married to Sonia Rodr\u00edguez, a Dominican TV dancer as a child,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cruz|first1=H\u00e9ctor J.|title=\u00c9l tambi\u00e9n es un humano, no lo olviden|url=http://www.listindiario.com/el-deporte/2010/06/07/145150/el-tambien-es-un-humano-no-lo-olviden|access-date=July 1, 2016|publisher=[[List\u00edn Diario]]|date=June 7, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701193035/http://www.listindiario.com/el-deporte/2010/06/07/145150/el-tambien-es-un-humano-no-lo-olviden|archivedate=July 1, 2016|language=Spanish|at=Note: The vedettes of the TV program \"{{illm|S\u00e1bado de Corpor\u00e1n|es}}\" were known as \"corporette\".|url-status=dead}}</ref> with whom he has six children: Keysha, Kenia, Sammy Jr., Michael, Kalexy and Rolando.

The buzz around this drastic change prompted him to go on a Spanish-language television station to deny that he was ill, or that he hated being dark-skinned, or that his new skin tone was the result of steroid use. Sosa explained that he uses a [[skin bleaching|bleaching cream]] before going to bed that softens and lightens his skin.<ref>{{cite

Republic|Dominican]] [[United States|American]] former professional [[baseball]] [[right fielder]] who played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for 19 seasons, primarily with the [[Chicago Cubs]]. After playing for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Chicago White Sox]], Sosa joined the Cubs in 1992 and became regarded as one of the game's best hitters. Sosa hit his 400th home run in his 1,354th game and his 5,273rd at-bat, reaching this milestone quicker than any player in [[National League]] history. He is one of nine players in MLB history to hit 600 career home runs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/sortable.jsp?c_id=mlb#elem=%5Bobject+Object%5D&tab_level=child&click_text=Sortable+Player+hitting&sectionType=sp&statType=hitting&page=1&ts=1529343009753&sortColumn=hr&sortOrder='desc'&extended=0&split=&season=2018&game_type='R'&playerType=ALL&timeframe=&season_type=ALL&league_code='MLB'|title=Sortable Player Stats|website=Major League Baseball|language=en|access-date=June 18, 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn 1998, Sosa and [[Mark McGwire]] achieved national fame for their [[home run]]-hitting prowess in pursuit of [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|Roger Maris' home run record]]. With the Cubs, Sosa became a 7-time [[MLB All-Star|All-Star]] while holding numerous [[List of Chicago Cubs team records|team records]]. He finished his career with stints with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] and the Rangers for a second time.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\">[https://www.baseball-reference.com/s/sosasa01.shtml Sammy Sosa career stats.] Baseball-Reference.com. Accessed June 5, 2007.</ref> With the Rangers, Sosa hit his 600th career home run to become the fifth player in MLB history to reach the milestone. \n\nSosa is second all-time in home runs among foreign-born MLB players and is one of only three National League players since 1900 to reach 160 [[RBI]]s in a season (2001). He is also the only player to have hit 60 or more home runs in a single season three times.\n\nIn a 2005 [[congressional hearing]], Sosa{{emdash}}through his attorney{{emdash}}denied having used [[performance-enhancing drugs]] during his playing career.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSosa was born in the [[Dominican Republic]].

He hit his first career [[home run]] off [[Roger Clemens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/mlb/events/mlb_sosa_five_hundred_hr.jsp|title=BASEBALL; Sammy Sosa joins the 500 club|publisher=|via=www.MLB.com}}</ref>\n\nOn July 29, 1989, the Rangers traded Sosa with [[Wilson \u00c1lvarez]] and [[Scott Fletcher (baseball)|Scott Fletcher]] to the Chicago White Sox for [[Harold Baines]] and [[Fred Manrique]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/30/sports/baseball-baines-to-rangers-for-fletcher.html|title=BASEBALL; Baines to Rangers For Fletcher|first=|last=AP|date=July 30, 1989|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref> In 1990, Sosa batted .233 with 15 home runs, 70 [[runs batted in]], 10 [[Triple (baseball)|triples]], and 32 stolen bases. He also struck out 150 times, fourth most in the American League. Sosa started the 1991 season by hitting 2 home runs and driving in 5 runs. However, he would slump for the rest of the year and ended up batting .203 with 10 home runs and 33 runs batted in.\n\n===Chicago Cubs (1992&ndash;2004)===\nThe White Sox traded Sosa and [[Ken Patterson]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[outfielder]] [[George Bell (outfielder)|George Bell]] before the 1992 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/01/03/score-20-flashback-1-white-sox-trade-sosa-to-cubs-for-bell/|title=Flashback #1: White Sox Trade Sosa To Cubs For Bell (1992)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSosa batted .260 with 8 home runs and 25 RBIs in his first season with the Cubs. Although not spectacular numbers, it showed that Sosa improved as a hitter. In 1993, Sosa batted .261 with 33 [[home runs]] with 93 RBIs. He also showed his speed by stealing 38 bases. He became the Cubs' first 30-30 player in their history. Sosa continued to hit for power and speed in 1994 but he also improved his batting average. He ended up batting .300 with 25 home runs, 70 RBIs, and 22 [[stolen bases]].\n\nSosa was named to his first All-Star team in 1995. In 144 games, he batted .268 with 36 home runs and 119 RBIs. Sosa continued his success with the Cubs in 1996 as he batted .273 with 40 home runs and 100 RBIs. However, the next year, Sosa struggled. Despite hitting 36 home runs with 119 RBIs, Sosa batted just .251. He struggled to get on base(.300 on-base percentage) and led the league in strikeouts with 174.\n\nAfter years as a respected power/speed threat with a rocket arm in right field, he emerged during the 1998 season as one of baseball's greatest. It was in this season that both Sosa and [[Mark McGwire]] were involved in the \"[[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|home run record chase]]\", when both players' prowess for hitting [[home run]]s drew national attention as they attempted to pass [[Roger Maris]]' single season home run mark of 61 home runs that had stood since 1961. For the early months of the year, Sosa trailed McGwire significantly, being as many as 16 homers behind at one point in May. But as the chase progressed, Sosa would rally and eventually tie McGwire with 46 home runs each on August 10, after a couple months of straggling within a few homers for the lead. However, the moment was short lived as McGwire would pull away slightly and reach 62 home runs to break the record first on September 8, but once again Sosa would excitingly heat up the race by tying McGwire once again at 62 on September 13. Eleven days later, with two games left to play in the season, the two were tied at 66 home runs each. Sosa would end the season with 66 after playing both games without a home run(still a team record), just behind McGwire's 70 after hitting two home runs in each of the last two games. However, Sammy had become the first Major League batter ever to hit 66 home runs in a season. It was during that season, that Cubs announcer [[Chip Caray]] nicknamed him \"'''Slammin' Sammy'''\", a nickname that quickly spread. In addition, Sammy produced then career highs in batting average and slugging percentage, at .308 and .647 respectively. Sosa also led the league in [[RBI]]s and runs scored. [[File:Sosa cubs jersey.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Sosa wore #21 with the Cubs in honor of his childhood idol [[Roberto Clemente]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cunniff | first = Bill | title = Sosa plays host at party at his island mansion | page = 3 | work = Chicago Sun-Times | date = November 26, 1999 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB424463A5BF794&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | accessdate = October 4, 2008 }}</ref>]]  Also in 1998, Sosa's 416 total bases were the most in a single season since [[Stan Musial]]'s 429 in 1948. Sosa's performance in the month of June, during which Sosa belted 20 home runs, knocked in 47 runs, and posted an .842 [[slugging percentage]], was one of the greatest offensive outbursts in major league history. Sosa won the [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|National League Most Valuable Player Award]] for leading the Cubs into the playoffs in 1998, earning every first-place vote except for the two cast by [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] writers, who voted for McGwire. He and McGwire shared ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's 1998 \"[[Sportsman of the Year]]\" award. Sosa was honored with a [[ticker-tape parade]] in his honor in New York City, and he was invited to be a guest at US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1999 [[State of the Union Address]]. 1998 was also the first time the Cubs made the post-season since 1989. The Cubs qualified as the NL Wild Card team, but were swept by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1998 National League Division Series#Atlanta Braves vs. Chicago Cubs|NLDS]].\n\nIn the 1999 season, Sosa hit 63 home runs, again trailing Mark McGwire, who hit 65. In the 2000 season, Sosa led the league by hitting 50 home runs. He received the [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading MLB in homers.<ref>{{cite news |last=MacMullan |first=Jackie |title=A bronze homage to Babe |date=October 17, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=E3 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/214273981.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+17%2C+2002&author=JACKIE+MACMULLAN&pub=Boston+Globe&desc=A+BRONZE+HOMAGE+TO+BABE&pqatl=google |access-date=November 8, 2011 |quote=By 2001, they were paying their own way to present Sammy Sosa with his Babe Ruth Award.}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, he hit 64 home runs, becoming the first player to hit 60 home runs in three seasons in his career. However, he did not lead the league in any of those seasons; in 2001, he finished behind [[Barry Bonds]], who hit 73 homers, breaking the single-season home run record set by McGwire in 1998 (70). In the same season he set personal records in [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored (146), [[Run batted in|RBI]] (160), [[Base on balls|walks]] (116), [[on-base percentage]] (.437), [[slugging percentage]] (.737), and [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (.328).<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" /> He led the majors in runs and RBI, was 2nd in home runs, 2nd in slugging percentage, 1st in total bases, 3rd in walks, 4th in on-base percentage, 12th in batting average, and 15th in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. He also surpassed his 1998 number in total bases, racking up 425. Sosa once again led the league in home runs with 49 in 2002. Known as a free-swinger in his early years, and as a good [[strikeout]] candidate, Sammy became an effective hitter for average. He owns numerous team records for the Cubs, and he holds the major-league record for the most home runs hit in a month (20, in June 1998). In recognition of his accomplishments as a hitter, Sosa won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] (an award for offensive output, voted on by managers and coaches) in 1995 and in 1998 through 2002.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\n{{anchor|Corked bat incident}}\nIn 2003, the Cubs won the National League Central Division title. The year was not all good news for Sosa, however. In May, he spent his first period on the [[disabled list]] since 1996 after having an injured toenail removed. On June 3, 2003, Sosa was ejected from a Chicago Cubs-[[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] game in the first inning when umpires discovered he had been using a [[corked bat]].<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2003/0603/1562772.html Sosa ejected after cork is found in shattered bat.] (June 4, 2003) ESPN.com.

Accessed June 5, 2007.</ref> Sosa finished the season with 40 home runs, and he hit two more in the [[2003 National League Championship Series|2003 NLCS]] against the [[Florida Marlins]], which the Cubs led 3 games to 1 before ultimately falling in seven games.\n\nIn May 2004, Sosa suffered an odd injury while sitting next to his locker chatting with reporters before a game in San Diego's [[Petco Park]]. He sneezed very violently, causing severe back pain. He was diagnosed with back spasms and placed on the disabled list. Later, he fell into one of the worst slumps of his career, only snapping out of it during the last week of the season. He was greatly depressed when the officials told him he couldn't play. He finished with 35 homers, far below his numbers of his best years.  In his final 10 years with the Cubs he clubbed 479 home runs; the most in history over a 10-year span. The final straw for the Cubs was an incident in late 2004. Sosa requested to sit out the last game of the season, which was at home against the [[Atlanta Braves]], and he left [[Wrigley Field]] early in the game. It was his last time in a Cubs uniform.\n\n===Baltimore Orioles and year off (2005&ndash;2006)===\n[[File:Sosa Spring training.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Sosa in spring training with the Orioles in 2005]]\nOn January 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Sosa to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in exchange for [[infielder]]-outfielder [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]], infielder [[Mike Fontenot]], and RHP Dave Crouthers. To facilitate the deal, Sosa and his [[sports agent|agent]] agreed to waive the clause that guaranteed his 2006 salary, and the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]] indicated it would not object to that agreement. Under the deal, Sosa earned $17.875 million for the 2005 season, with the Cubs paying $7 million of his salary. By playing for the 2005 Orioles alongside fellow 500-home-run batter [[Rafael Palmeiro]], Sosa and Palmeiro became the first [[500 home run club]] members in history to play together on the same team after reaching the 500 home run plateau.{{efn|[[Hank Aaron]] reached 500 homers shortly after his teammate [[Eddie Mathews]] (512 homers) retired.|group=lower-alpha}}\n\nSosa finished the 2005 season batting .221 with 14 home runs, his worst performance since 1992, and continuing his post-2001 trend of declines in batting average, homers, total bases, and RBI. On December 7, 2005, the Orioles decided not to offer him an arbitration contract, effectively ending his Baltimore Orioles tenure and making him a free agent.\n\nIn 2005, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' published an update of their 1999 book ''Baseball's 100 Greatest Players''. Sosa did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher, he was ranked at Number 95. During a stretch of nine consecutive years, Sosa hit 35 or more home runs and 100+ RBIs, all with the Chicago Cubs.<ref name=\"BBREF.com\" />\n\nAt the end of January 2006, the [[Washington Nationals]] offered Sosa two different minor-league offers, both of which he turned down. On February 15, 2006, Sosa's agent [[Adam Katz]] stated: \"We're not going to put him on the retirement list. We decided that [not putting him on that list] was the best thing to do.

This was the same contract that Sosa turned down the previous year from the Nationals. The contract included an invitation to [[spring training]], where Sosa competed for a spot in the lineup with [[Nelson Cruz]], [[Jason Botts]], and other rookies/prospects.<ref>T. R.

He started the 2007 season as the Rangers' designated hitter and occasional right fielder.\nAt the same time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's number 21 to new pitcher [[Jason Marquis]], who coincidentally served up Sosa's 600th career home run. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111,CST-SPT-deluca22.article|title=Sosa's 21 a long-distance number|last=DeLuca|first=Chris|date=February 22, 2007|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 4, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014727/http://www.suntimes.com/sports/deluca/268111%2CCST-SPT-deluca22.article|archivedate=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn April 26, 2007, Sosa made history by hitting a home run in his 45th major league ballpark. He has also homered in [[Champion Stadium|The Ballpark at Disney's Wide World of Sports]], near [[Orlando, Florida]], a usually minor-league and [[Spring training]] park that hosted a regular season series between the Rangers and the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] in May 2007, although he did not hit a homer at the two regular season games the Cubs played at the Tokyo Dome in 2000 vs. the Mets.\n\nOn June 20, 2007, Sosa hit a home run off of [[Jason Marquis]] during an inter-league game against the Chicago Cubs. Sosa became only the fifth man in history, following [[Babe Ruth]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Hank Aaron]], and [[Barry Bonds]], to hit 600 regular season home runs. The home run was the first one that Sosa had recorded against the Cubs, and as a result he has hit a home run against every active MLB team.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2911022 | title=Sosa becomes fifth player to blast 600 home runs | work=Associated Press | publisher=ESPN | date=June 20, 2007 | accessdate=June 19, 2017}}</ref> Sosa is the Cubs' all-time home run leader, having hit 545 with that team.\n\nOn May 28, 2008, Sosa announced that he instructed his agent not to offer his services to any MLB team for the 2008 season, and planned on filing for retirement, but never did.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3415614|title=Sosa not pursuing MLB job, says he intends to retire in 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2008 |work=ESPN.com|publisher= |date= }}</ref>\n\nOn December 25, 2008, Sosa announced he intended to unretire and play in the [[World Baseball Classic]] and once again test the free agent market in hopes of signing with a Major League ballclub in 2009.

However, he was not selected as part of the Dominican Republic's roster.  He remained a free agent and did not actively look for a team.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Sosa announced his intention to retire from baseball.

His [[English people|English]] paternal ancestors emigrated to America in the 17th century, originally settling in [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland]]. Knotts' brothers were named Willis, William, and Ralph.\n\nDon's mother was 40 at the time of his birth and his father suffered from mental illness; he had a [[nervous breakdown]] due to the stress of Don's birth.

After high school, he traveled to [[New York City]] to try to make his way as a comedian but returned home to attend West Virginia University when his career failed to take off. After his college freshman year, Knotts joined the U.S. Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops.<ref name=drill /> He toured the western [[Pacific Islands]] as a comedian as part of a G.I. variety show called \"Stars and Gripes\".<ref name=biography>{{cite web |url = http://www.biography.com/people/don-knotts-9542240 |title = Biography of Don Knotts |website = biography.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nHis [[ventriloquist]] act included a dummy named Danny \"Hooch\" Matador. In a ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine interview in the 1970s, he said that he had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the [[Australasia|South Pacific]].\n\nKnotts served in the U.S. Army from June 21, 1943, to January 6, 1946. Discharged in the rank of Technician Grade 5, which was the equivalent then of a Corporal. During his military service, Knotts was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 4 bronze service stars), Army Good Conduct Medal, Marksman Badge (with an [[M1 Carbine]]) and Honorable Service lapel pin.\n\nKnotts returned to West Virginia University after being demobilized and graduated in 1948. He married and moved back to New York, where connections he had made while in the Special Services Branch helped him break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on the radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character \"Windy Wales\" on a radio Western called \"[[Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders]]\".<ref name=obituary>{{cite web |url = http://www.legacy.com/ns/don-knotts-obituary/16845505 |title = Don Knotts Obituary |website = legacy.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts got his first major break on television in the [[soap opera]] ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on [[Steve Allen]]'s variety show, as part of Allen's repertory company, most notably in Allen's mock \"Man in the Street\" interviews, always as an extremely nervous man. He remained with the Allen program through the 1959\u20131960 season. From October 20, 1955, through September 14, 1957, Knotts appeared in the Broadway play version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants]]'', in which he played two roles, listed on the playbill as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher.<ref>{{cite web |title = No Time for Sergeants: Opening Night Cast |work = [[Playbill (magazine)|Playbill]] |date = March 30, 2014 }}</ref> In 1958, Knotts appeared for the first time on film with [[Andy Griffith]] in the film version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants (1958 film)|No Time for Sergeants]]''.

Knotts took the role of Barney Fife, the deputy\u2014and originally cousin\u2014of Sheriff [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Andy Taylor]] (portrayed by Griffith).

He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever frustrated that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm \"Don Knotts.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522043858/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm |date=May 22, 2008 }} Museum of Broadcast Communications</ref>}}\n\nWhen the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his [[straight man]], similar to their roles in ''No Time for Sergeants''. However, it was quickly discovered that the show was funnier with the roles reversed. As Griffith maintained in several interviews, \"By the second episode, I knew that Don should be funny, and I should play straight.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = Mayberry Memories: The Andy Griffith Show Photo Album |edition = 40 |year = 2000 |publisher = Thomas Nelson Inc |isbn = 1-55853-830-5 |page = 6 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts believed remarks by Griffith that ''The Andy Griffith Show'' would end after five seasons, and he began to look for other work, signing a five-film contract with [[Universal Studios]]. He was caught off guard when Griffith announced that he would continue the show after all, but Knotts's hands were tied. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed a contract when Griffith announced his decision; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character's absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife's having finally made the \"big time,\" joining the Raleigh, North Carolina police force.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = The Andy Griffith Show Book |edition = 3 |year = 2000 |publisher = Macmillan |isbn = 0-312-26287-6 |page = 129 }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Mayberry film career ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Ernie Ford Don Knotts Andy Griffith Special 1967.JPG|thumb|On a 1967 Andy Griffith special, Knotts plays the outraged wife of [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], as Griffith looks on]]\nKnotts went on to star in a series of film comedies that drew on his high-strung persona from the television series: he had a cameo appearance in [[United Artists]]' ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and starred in [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]'' (1964). Knotts then began his Universal five-film contract with ''[[The Ghost and Mr. Chicken]]'' (1966), ''[[The Reluctant Astronaut]]'' (1967), ''[[The Shakiest Gun in the West]]'' (1968), ''[[The Love God?]]'' (1969) and ''[[How to Frame a Figg]]'' (1971). Knotts reprised his role as Barney Fife several times in the 1960s: he made five guest appearances on ''The Andy Griffith Show'' (gaining him another two Emmy Awards), and he later appeared once on the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Mayberry RFD]]'', where he was present as best man for the marriage of Andy Taylor and his longtime love, [[Helen Crump]].\n\nAfter making ''How to Frame a Figg'', Knotts's five-film contract with Universal finished. He continued to work steadily, though he did not appear as a regular on any successful television series until his appearance on ''[[Three's Company]]'' in 1979. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Knotts served as the spokesman for [[Dodge]] trucks and was featured prominently in a series of print ads and dealer brochures. On television, he went on to host a variety show/sitcom hybrid on [[NBC]], ''The Don Knotts Show'', which aired Tuesdays during the fall of 1970, but the series was low-rated and short-lived. He also made frequent guest appearances on other shows such as ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[Here's Lucy]]''. In 1970, he appeared as a Barney Fife-like police officer in the pilot of ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]''. In 1972, Knotts voiced an animated version of himself in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby Doo Movies]]'': \"The Spooky Fog of Juneberry\", in which he played a lawman resembling Barney Fife, and \"Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner\". He also appeared as Felix Unger in a stage version of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'', with [[Art Carney]] as Oscar Madison.\n\nBeginning in 1975, Knotts was teamed with [[Tim Conway]] in a series of [[slapstick]] films aimed at children, including the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'' (1975) and its sequel, ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]'' (1979). They also did two independent films, the boxing comedy ''[[The Prize Fighter]]'' (1979), and the mystery-comedy ''[[The Private Eyes (1980 film)|The Private Eyes]]'' (1980). Knotts co-starred in several other Disney films, including ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]]'' (1976), ''[[No Deposit, No Return]]'' (1976), ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hot Lead and Cold Feet]]'' (1978).\n\n=== ''Three's Company'' ===\nIn 1979, Knotts returned to series television in his second most identifiable role, the wacky-but-lovable landlord [[Ralph Furley]] on ''[[Three's Company]]''. The series, which was already an established hit, added Knotts to the cast when the original landlords, [[Helen Roper]] and her husband [[Stanley Roper]] (a married couple played by [[Audra Lindley]] and [[Norman Fell]], respectively) left the series to star in their own short-lived spin-off series (''[[The Ropers]]'').\n\nOn set, Knotts easily integrated himself to the already-established cast who were, as [[John Ritter]] put it, \"so scared\" of Knotts because of his star status when he joined the cast. When [[Suzanne Somers]] left the show after a contract dispute in 1981, the writers started giving the material meant for Somers's Chrissy to Knotts's Furley. Knotts remained on the series until it ended in 1984. The ''Three's Company'' script supervisor, Carol Summers, became Knotts' agent and often accompanied him to personal appearances.\n\n=== Later years ===\nIn 1986, Don Knotts reunited with Andy Griffith in the made-for-television film ''[[Return to Mayberry]]'', again reprising his Barney Fife role. In early 1987, Knotts joined the cast of the first-run syndication comedy ''[[What a Country!]]'', playing Principal Bud McPherson for the series' remaining 13 episodes. The sitcom was produced by Martin Rips and Joseph Staretski, who had previously worked on ''Three's Company''. In 1988, Knotts joined Andy Griffith in another show, playing the recurring role of pesky neighbor Les Calhoun on ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' until 1992.\n\nAfter that, Knotts's roles were sporadic, including a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Big Bully (film)|Big Bully]]'' (1996) as the principal of the high school. In 1998, Knotts played a small but pivotal role as a mysterious TV repairman in ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]''. That year, his home town of [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], changed the name of the street formerly known as ''South University Avenue'' ([[U.S. Route 119 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 119]]) to ''Don Knotts Boulevard'' on \"Don Knotts Day.\" Also that day, in honor of Knotts's role as Barney Fife, he was named an honorary deputy sheriff with the [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] Sheriff's Department.\n\nKnotts was recognized in 2000 with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He continued to act on stage, but much of his film and television work after 2000 was as voice talent. In 2002, he appeared again with [[Scooby-Doo]] in the video game ''[[Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights]]''. (Knotts also spoofed his appearances on that show in various promotions for [[Cartoon Network]] and in a parody on ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', where he was teamed with [[Phyllis Diller]].) In 2003, Knotts teamed up with [[Tim Conway]] again to provide voices for the direct-to-video children's series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]'', which continued until his death. In 2005, he was the voice of Mayor Turkey Lurkey in ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' (2005), his first Disney movie since 1979. On September 12, 2003, Knotts was in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in a stage version of ''[[On Golden Pond (play)|On Golden Pond]]'' when he received a call from [[John Ritter]]'s family telling him that his former ''Three's Company'' co-star had died of an [[aortic dissection]] that day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Knotts and his co-stars attended the funeral four days later. Knotts had appeared with Ritter one final time in a cameo on ''[[8 Simple Rules]] for Dating My Teenage Daughter''. It was an episode that paid homage to their earlier television series. Knotts was the last ''Three's Company'' star to work with Ritter.\n\nDuring this period of time, [[macular degeneration]] in both eyes caused the otherwise robust Knotts to become virtually blind. His live appearances on television were few. In 2005, Knotts parodied his Ralph Furley character while playing a [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]] variation in a ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' sketch on ''[[TV Land Award|The 3rd Annual TV Land Awards]]''. He parodied that part one final time in \"Stone Cold Crazy\", an episode of the sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''. In the show, Knotts played Fez and Jackie's new landlord. This was his last live-action television appearance. His final role was in ''[[Air Buddies]]'' (2006) (a direct-to-video sequel to ''[[Air Bud]]''), voicing the sheriff's deputy dog, Sniffer.\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\nKnotts was married three times. His marriage to Kathryn Metz lasted from 1947 until their divorce in 1964. He married Loralee Czuchna in 1974 and they divorced in 1983. His third marriage was to Frances Yarborough, from 2002 until his death in 2006. From his first marriage, Knotts had a son, Thomas Knotts, and a daughter, actress [[Karen Knotts]] (born April 2, 1954).\n\nKnotts struggled with [[hypochondria]] and [[macular degeneration]].<ref name=\"biography\" /><ref name=\"Obit\">{{cite news |last1 = Collins |first1 = Scott |title = Don Knotts, star of 'The Andy Griffith Show,' dead at 81 |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/25/nation/la-na-donknotts-obit/2 |accessdate = July 19, 2017 |work = Los Angeles Times |date = February 25, 2006 }}</ref> [[Betty Lynn]], one of Knotts' co-stars on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', described him as a \"very quiet man.

He also starred in multiple comedic films, including playing Luther Heggs in ''[[The Ghost and Mr. Chicken]]'' (1966) and Henry Limpet in ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]'' (1964). In 1979 ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked him #27 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.<ref>{{cite book |title = TV Guide Guide to TV |year = 2004 |publisher = Barnes and Noble |isbn = 0-7607-5634-1 |page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780760756348/page/596 596] |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780760756348/page/596 }}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nJesse Donald Knotts was born in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], the youngest of four sons born to farmer William Jesse Knotts and his wife, Elsie Luzetta Knotts (''n\u00e9e'' Moore). His parents were married in [[Spraggs, Pennsylvania]]. His [[English people|English]] paternal ancestors emigrated to America in the 17th century, originally settling in [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland]]. Knotts' brothers were named Willis, William, and Ralph.\n\nDon's mother was 40 at the time of his birth and his father suffered from mental illness; he had a [[nervous breakdown]] due to the stress of Don's birth. Afflicted with [[schizophrenia]] and [[alcoholism]], he sometimes terrorized Don with a knife,<ref>{{cite book |last = de Vis\u00e9 |first = Daniel |date = 2015 |title = Andy and Don: The Making of a Friendship and a Classic American TV Show |page = 5 |location = New York |publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn = 1-4767-4773-3 }}</ref> causing Don to turn inward at an early age. The elder Knotts died of [[pneumonia]] when Don was 13 years old. Don and his three brothers were then raised by their mother, who ran a [[boarding house]] in Morgantown. She died in 1969 at age 84. Her son William preceded her in death in 1941 at age 31. They are buried in the family plot at Beverly Hills Memorial Park in Morgantown. Don graduated from [[Morgantown High School]].

After high school, he traveled to [[New York City]] to try to make his way as a comedian but returned home to attend West Virginia University when his career failed to take off. After his college freshman year, Knotts joined the U.S. Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops.<ref name=drill /> He toured the western [[Pacific Islands]] as a comedian as part of a G.I. variety show called \"Stars and Gripes\".<ref name=biography>{{cite web |url = http://www.biography.com/people/don-knotts-9542240 |title = Biography of Don Knotts |website = biography.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nHis [[ventriloquist]] act included a dummy named Danny \"Hooch\" Matador. In a ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine interview in the 1970s, he said that he had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the [[Australasia|South Pacific]].\n\nKnotts served in the U.S. Army from June 21, 1943, to January 6, 1946. Discharged in the rank of Technician Grade 5, which was the equivalent then of a Corporal. During his military service, Knotts was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 4 bronze service stars), Army Good Conduct Medal, Marksman Badge (with an [[M1 Carbine]]) and Honorable Service lapel pin.\n\nKnotts returned to West Virginia University after being demobilized and graduated in 1948. He married and moved back to New York, where connections he had made while in the Special Services Branch helped him break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on the radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character \"Windy Wales\" on a radio Western called \"[[Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders]]\".<ref name=obituary>{{cite web |url = http://www.legacy.com/ns/don-knotts-obituary/16845505 |title = Don Knotts Obituary |website = legacy.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts got his first major break on television in the [[soap opera]] ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on [[Steve Allen]]'s variety show, as part of Allen's repertory company, most notably in Allen's mock \"Man in the Street\" interviews, always as an extremely nervous man. He remained with the Allen program through the 1959\u20131960 season. From October 20, 1955, through September 14, 1957, Knotts appeared in the Broadway play version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants]]'', in which he played two roles, listed on the playbill as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher.<ref>{{cite web |title = No Time for Sergeants: Opening Night Cast |work = [[Playbill (magazine)|Playbill]] |date = March 30, 2014 }}</ref> In 1958, Knotts appeared for the first time on film with [[Andy Griffith]] in the film version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants (1958 film)|No Time for Sergeants]]''. In that film, Knotts reprises his Broadway role and plays a high-strung Air Force test administrator whose routine is disrupted by the hijinks of a provincial new recruit.\n\n=== ''The Andy Griffith Show'' ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Don Knotts 1960.JPG|thumb|As Barney Fife, Knotts gets the help of Sheriff Taylor when his gun gets stuck on his finger]]\n[[File:DonKnotts1961.jpg|thumb|Knotts receives his first [[Emmy Award]] for ''The Andy Griffith Show'', 1961]]\nIn 1960, Andy Griffith was offered the opportunity to headline his own [[sitcom]], ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' (1960\u20131968). Knotts took the role of Barney Fife, the deputy\u2014and originally cousin\u2014of Sheriff [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Andy Taylor]] (portrayed by Griffith). Knotts's portrayal of the deputy on the popular show earned him five [[Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Best Supporting Actor in a Television Comedy]], three awards for the first five seasons that he played the character.<ref>{{cite book |last = Monush |first = Barry |title = Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the Silent Era to 1965 |volume = 1 |year = 2003 |publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn = 1-55783-551-9 |page = 397 }}</ref>\n\nA summary of the show from the website of the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] describes Deputy Barney Fife:\n\n{{quote|Self-important, romantic, and nearly always wrong, Barney dreamed of the day he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever frustrated that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm \"Don Knotts.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522043858/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm |date=May 22, 2008 }} Museum of Broadcast Communications</ref>}}\n\nWhen the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his [[straight man]], similar to their roles in ''No Time for Sergeants''. However, it was quickly discovered that the show was funnier with the roles reversed. As Griffith maintained in several interviews, \"By the second episode, I knew that Don should be funny, and I should play straight.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = Mayberry Memories: The Andy Griffith Show Photo Album |edition = 40 |year = 2000 |publisher = Thomas Nelson Inc |isbn = 1-55853-830-5 |page = 6 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts believed remarks by Griffith that ''The Andy Griffith Show'' would end after five seasons, and he began to look for other work, signing a five-film contract with [[Universal Studios]]. He was caught off guard when Griffith announced that he would continue the show after all, but Knotts's hands were tied. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed a contract when Griffith announced his decision; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character's absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife's having finally made the \"big time,\" joining the Raleigh, North Carolina police force.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = The Andy Griffith Show Book |edition = 3 |year = 2000 |publisher = Macmillan |isbn = 0-312-26287-6 |page = 129 }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Mayberry film career ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Ernie Ford Don Knotts Andy Griffith Special 1967.JPG|thumb|On a 1967 Andy Griffith special, Knotts plays the outraged wife of [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], as Griffith looks on]]\nKnotts went on to star in a series of film comedies that drew on his high-strung persona from the television series: he had a cameo appearance in [[United Artists]]' ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and starred in [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]'' (1964). Knotts then began his Universal five-film contract with ''[[The Ghost and Mr. Chicken]]'' (1966), ''[[The Reluctant Astronaut]]'' (1967), ''[[The Shakiest Gun in the West]]'' (1968), ''[[The Love God?]]'' (1969) and ''[[How to Frame a Figg]]'' (1971). Knotts reprised his role as Barney Fife several times in the 1960s: he made five guest appearances on ''The Andy Griffith Show'' (gaining him another two Emmy Awards), and he later appeared once on the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Mayberry RFD]]'', where he was present as best man for the marriage of Andy Taylor and his longtime love, [[Helen Crump]].\n\nAfter making ''How to Frame a Figg'', Knotts's five-film contract with Universal finished. He continued to work steadily, though he did not appear as a regular on any successful television series until his appearance on ''[[Three's Company]]'' in 1979. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Knotts served as the spokesman for [[Dodge]] trucks and was featured prominently in a series of print ads and dealer brochures. On television, he went on to host a variety show/sitcom hybrid on [[NBC]], ''The Don Knotts Show'', which aired Tuesdays during the fall of 1970, but the series was low-rated and short-lived. He also made frequent guest appearances on other shows such as ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[Here's Lucy]]''. In 1970, he appeared as a Barney Fife-like police officer in the pilot of ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]''. In 1972, Knotts voiced an animated version of himself in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby Doo Movies]]'': \"The Spooky Fog of Juneberry\", in which he played a lawman resembling Barney Fife, and \"Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner\". He also appeared as Felix Unger in a stage version of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'', with [[Art Carney]] as Oscar Madison.\n\nBeginning in 1975, Knotts was teamed with [[Tim Conway]] in a series of [[slapstick]] films aimed at children, including the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'' (1975) and its sequel, ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]'' (1979). They also did two independent films, the boxing comedy ''[[The Prize Fighter]]'' (1979), and the mystery-comedy ''[[The Private Eyes (1980 film)|The Private Eyes]]'' (1980). Knotts co-starred in several other Disney films, including ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]]'' (1976), ''[[No Deposit, No Return]]'' (1976), ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hot Lead and Cold Feet]]'' (1978).\n\n=== ''Three's Company'' ===\nIn 1979, Knotts returned to series television in his second most identifiable role, the wacky-but-lovable landlord [[Ralph Furley]] on ''[[Three's Company]]''. The series, which was already an established hit, added Knotts to the cast when the original landlords, [[Helen Roper]] and her husband [[Stanley Roper]] (a married couple played by [[Audra Lindley]] and [[Norman Fell]], respectively) left the series to star in their own short-lived spin-off series (''[[The Ropers]]'').\n\nOn set, Knotts easily integrated himself to the already-established cast who were, as [[John Ritter]] put it, \"so scared\" of Knotts because of his star status when he joined the cast. When [[Suzanne Somers]] left the show after a contract dispute in 1981, the writers started giving the material meant for Somers's Chrissy to Knotts's Furley. Knotts remained on the series until it ended in 1984. The ''Three's Company'' script supervisor, Carol Summers, became Knotts' agent and often accompanied him to personal appearances.\n\n=== Later years ===\nIn 1986, Don Knotts reunited with Andy Griffith in the made-for-television film ''[[Return to Mayberry]]'', again reprising his Barney Fife role. In early 1987, Knotts joined the cast of the first-run syndication comedy ''[[What a Country!]]'', playing Principal Bud McPherson for the series' remaining 13 episodes. The sitcom was produced by Martin Rips and Joseph Staretski, who had previously worked on ''Three's Company''. In 1988, Knotts joined Andy Griffith in another show, playing the recurring role of pesky neighbor Les Calhoun on ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' until 1992.\n\nAfter that, Knotts's roles were sporadic, including a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Big Bully (film)|Big Bully]]'' (1996) as the principal of the high school. In 1998, Knotts played a small but pivotal role as a mysterious TV repairman in ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]''. That year, his home town of [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], changed the name of the street formerly known as ''South University Avenue'' ([[U.S. Route 119 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 119]]) to ''Don Knotts Boulevard'' on \"Don Knotts Day.\" Also that day, in honor of Knotts's role as Barney Fife, he was named an honorary deputy sheriff with the [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] Sheriff's Department.\n\nKnotts was recognized in 2000 with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He continued to act on stage, but much of his film and television work after 2000 was as voice talent. In 2002, he appeared again with [[Scooby-Doo]] in the video game ''[[Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights]]''. (Knotts also spoofed his appearances on that show in various promotions for [[Cartoon Network]] and in a parody on ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', where he was teamed with [[Phyllis Diller]].) In 2003, Knotts teamed up with [[Tim Conway]] again to provide voices for the direct-to-video children's series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]'', which continued until his death. In 2005, he was the voice of Mayor Turkey Lurkey in ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' (2005), his first Disney movie since 1979. On September 12, 2003, Knotts was in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in a stage version of ''[[On Golden Pond (play)|On Golden Pond]]'' when he received a call from [[John Ritter]]'s family telling him that his former ''Three's Company'' co-star had died of an [[aortic dissection]] that day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Knotts and his co-stars attended the funeral four days later. Knotts had appeared with Ritter one final time in a cameo on ''[[8 Simple Rules]] for Dating My Teenage Daughter''. It was an episode that paid homage to their earlier television series. Knotts was the last ''Three's Company'' star to work with Ritter.\n\nDuring this period of time, [[macular degeneration]] in both eyes caused the otherwise robust Knotts to become virtually blind. His live appearances on television were few. In 2005, Knotts parodied his Ralph Furley character while playing a [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]] variation in a ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' sketch on ''[[TV Land Award|The 3rd Annual TV Land Awards]]''. He parodied that part one final time in \"Stone Cold Crazy\", an episode of the sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''. In the show, Knotts played Fez and Jackie's new landlord. This was his last live-action television appearance. His final role was in ''[[Air Buddies]]'' (2006) (a direct-to-video sequel to ''[[Air Bud]]''), voicing the sheriff's deputy dog, Sniffer.\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\nKnotts was married three times. His marriage to Kathryn Metz lasted from 1947 until their divorce in 1964. He married Loralee Czuchna in 1974 and they divorced in 1983. His third marriage was to Frances Yarborough, from 2002 until his death in 2006. From his first marriage, Knotts had a son, Thomas Knotts, and a daughter, actress [[Karen Knotts]] (born April 2, 1954).\n\nKnotts struggled with [[hypochondria]] and [[macular degeneration]].<ref name=\"biography\" /><ref name=\"Obit\">{{cite news |last1 = Collins |first1 = Scott |title = Don Knotts, star of 'The Andy Griffith Show,' dead at 81 |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/25/nation/la-na-donknotts-obit/2 |accessdate = July 19, 2017 |work = Los Angeles Times |date = February 25, 2006 }}</ref> [[Betty Lynn]], one of Knotts' co-stars on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', described him as a \"very quiet man.

The back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.\n\nThe male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.\n\nThis little bird is native to Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Their breeding habitat is [[marsh]]es with tall vegetation such as [[cattail]]s across [[North America]]. In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds [[bird migration|migrate]] to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and [[Mexico]]. their non-breeding range is in the southern United States going into Mexico and their breeding range is in the northeastern United States going into Canada.<ref>Cornell All About Birds. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Foraging and Diet ==\nThese birds forage actively in vegetation close to the water, occasionally flying up to catch [[insect]]s in flight. They mainly eat insects, also [[spider]]s and [[snail]]s. In California, 53 Western Marsh Wren stomachs were examined which showed that the birds consume bugs (29%), caterpillars and chrysalids (17%), beetles (16%), ants and wasps (8%), spiders (5%), carabids and coccinellids  (2%), with various other flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies and unidentifiable insect remains making up over 11 percent. Ants and wasps were observed to be mostly eaten in the fall. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory|title=Marsh Wren|last=|first=|date=|website=All About Birds|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Beal|first=F.

The back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.\n\nThe male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.\n\nThis little bird is native to Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Their breeding habitat is [[marsh]]es with tall vegetation such as [[cattail]]s across [[North America]]. In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds [[bird migration|migrate]] to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and [[Mexico]]. their non-breeding range is in the southern United States going into Mexico and their breeding range is in the northeastern United States going into Canada.<ref>Cornell All About Birds. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Foraging and Diet ==\nThese birds forage actively in vegetation close to the water, occasionally flying up to catch [[insect]]s in flight. They mainly eat insects, also [[spider]]s and [[snail]]s. In California, 53 Western Marsh Wren stomachs were examined which showed that the birds consume bugs (29%), caterpillars and chrysalids (17%), beetles (16%), ants and wasps (8%), spiders (5%), carabids and coccinellids  (2%), with various other flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies and unidentifiable insect remains making up over 11 percent. Ants and wasps were observed to be mostly eaten in the fall. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory|title=Marsh Wren|last=|first=|date=|website=All About Birds|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Beal|first=F.

The male builds many unused nests in his territory. A hypothesis of the possible reason to why males build multiple \"dummy\" nests in their territory is that they are courting areas and that the females construct the \"breeding nest\", where she lays the eggs in.<ref>Metz, Karen J. \u201cThe Enigma of Multiple Nest Building by Male Marsh Wrens.\u201d Jan. 1991, pp. 170\u2013173.</ref> He may puncture the eggs and fatally peck the nestlings of other birds nesting nearby, including his own species (even his own offspring) and [[red-winged blackbird]]s, [[yellow-headed blackbird]]s, and [[least bittern]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/308|title=Marsh Wren (''Cistothorus palustris'')|last1=Kroodsma|first1=Donald E.|last2=Verner|first2=Jared|year=1997|editor=A.
