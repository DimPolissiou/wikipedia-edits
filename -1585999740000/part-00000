Free associated states can be described as independent or not, but free association is not a qualification of an entity's statehood or status as a subject of international law.\n\nInformally it can be considered more widely: from a post-colonial form of [[protectorate|amical protection]], or [[protectorate]], to [[asymmetrical federalism|confederation of unequal members]] when the lesser partner(s) delegate(s) to the major one (often the former colonial power) some authority normally exclusively retained by a sovereign state, usually in such fields as defense and foreign relations, while often enjoying favorable economic terms such as market access.\n\nAccording to some scholars, a form of association based on benign protection and delegation of sovereignty can be seen as a defining feature of [[microstates]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Microstates_OccasionalPaper.pdf|title = Microstates as Modern Protected States: Towards a New Definition of Micro-Statehood|last = Dumie\u0144ski|first = Zbigniew|date = 2014|journal = |accessdate = 20 August 2014|doi = |pmid = |publisher = Centre for Small State Studies|series = Occasional Paper}}</ref>\n\nA [[federacy]], a type of government where at least one of the subunits in an otherwise unitary state enjoys autonomy like a subunit within a federation, is similar to an associated state, with such subunit(s) having considerable independence in internal issues, except foreign affairs and defense. Yet in terms of international law{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} it is a completely different situation because the subunits are not independent international entities and have no potential right to independence.\n\n==Origin of the concept==\nThe concept of associated state was originally used to refer to arrangements under which Western powers afforded a (sometimes very limited) degree of self-government to some of their colonial possessions after the end of World War II. Soon after the conclusion of the war, the French colonial territories of [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]] were designated as 'associated states' within the newly-created [[French Union]]. The arrangement afforded these countries a limited degree of internal and external sovereignty (for example, they were allowed to enter into diplomatic relations with a small number of countries), but for the most part reserved for France effective control over foreign relations, as well as military, judicial, administrative, and economic activities.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last=Igarashi |first=Masahiro |date=2002 |title=Associated Statehood in International Law |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1peIxEyy1o0C&dq=associated+statehood+in+international+law|location=The Hague, Netherlands |publisher=Kluwer Law International |page=24 |isbn=90-411-1710-5 |author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indochine.uqam.ca/en/historical-dictionary/77-associated-states-of-indochina.html|title=UQAM &#124; Guerre d'Indochine &#124; ASSOCIATED STATES OF INDOCHINA|website=indochine.uqam.ca}}</ref> According to some French jurists, the concept of associated state under the 1946 French constitution automatically extended to the territories of [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]], which up until then had been protectorates of France.

Through the agreement Tatarstan delegated certain powers (such as some foreign relations and defense) to Russia.

Biomolecules may be present because the ''Phoenix'' landing site is likely to have been habitable in recent Martian history. Ground ice may protect organic molecules on Mars from destruction by oxidants and radiation, and as a result organics from biological or meteorite sources may be detectable in polar ice-rich ground at significant concentrations.\n#\u2002Perform a general search for organic molecules in the ground ice. If habitable conditions were present, then any organics may be of recent (<10\u2009million years) biological origin.\n#\u2002Determine the nature of the ground ice formation and the role of [[Water on Mars|liquid water]]. There may have been liquid water generated in the [[Martian soil|surface soils]] in the north polar regions within the past <10\u2009 million years due to orbital changes in [[insolation]].\n#\u2002Understand the mechanical properties of the martian polar ice-cemented soil. Polar ice may be a resource for human exploration, and the mechanical properties will reflect the stratigraphy of ice and soil, which may inform models of climate history.\n#\u2002Assess the recent habitability of the environment with respect to required elements to support life, energy sources, and possible toxic elements. The perchlorate present at the Phoenix site could provide a usable energy source if ferrous iron is present. A source of fixed nitrogen, such as [[nitrate]], is required for habitability.\n#\u2002Compare the elemental composition of the northern plains with mid-latitude sites.\n\nDuplicate samples could be cached as a target for possible return by a [[Mars sample return mission]].<ref name=\"LPI 2012\"/> If the samples were shown to contain organic [[biosignatures]], interest in returning them to Earth would be high.\n\n==Science==\nThe results from previous missions, and the ''Phoenix'' mission in particular, indicate that the ice-cemented ground in the north polar plains is likely to be the most recently habitable place that is currently known on Mars. The near-surface ice likely provided adequate [[water activity]] (a<sub>w</sub>) during periods of high obliquity 5 million years ago, when Mars had an orbital tilt of 45\u00b0, compared to the present value of 25\u00b0 and ground ice may have melted enough to preserve organic molecules, including organic [[biosignature]]s.\n\nThe two [[Viking program|''Viking'' landers]] conducted in 1976 the first, and so far only, search for current life on Mars. The biology experiments sought to detect living organisms based on the hypothesis that microbial life would be widely present in the soils, as it is on Earth, and that it would respond to [[Growth medium|nutrients added]] with liquid water. The [[Viking spacecraft biological experiments|''Viking'' biology experiments]] operated successfully on both landers, with an instrument showing signs of active bacterial [[metabolism]], but it did not occur with a duplicate heat-treated sample.<ref name=preliminary>{{cite journal |bibcode=1976Sci...194...99K |title=The Viking Biological Investigation: Preliminary Results |last1=Klein |first1=Harold P. |last2=Horowitz |first2=Norman H. |last3=Levin |first3=Gilbert V. |last4=Oyama |first4=Vance I. |last5=Lederberg |first5=Joshua |last6=Rich |first6=Alexander |last7=Hubbard |first7=Jerry S. |last8=Hobby |first8=George L. |last9=Straat |first9=Patricia A. |last10=Berdahl |first10=B.

This would lower the risk for biohazards during human exploration or sample return. However, this would not rule out life that does not have Earth-like biomarkers.\n\n===Preservation of biomolecules===\nOne of the key goals of the ''Icebreaker Life'' mission is to test the [[hypothesis]] that the ice-rich ground in the polar regions has significant concentrations of organics due to protection by the ice from [[Oxidizing agent|oxidants]] and [[Sunlight|radiation]].<ref name=\"update 2014\"/> Non-biological organics from infalling meteorites could be detectable in polar ice-rich ground at significant concentrations, so they could be used as indicators that ice actually protect and preserve organic molecules, whether biological or not.\n\nIf non-biological organics are found, then the north polar regions would be compelling targets for future [[astrobiology]] missions, especially because of the potential recent habitability (5 million years ago) of this ice. Target [[biomolecule]]s will be [[aminoacid]]s, [[protein]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, [[nucleic acids]] (''e.g''., [[DNA]], [[RNA]]) and some of their derivatives, [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] involved in [[redox]] reactions, [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] for intracellular signals, and polymeric compounds such as [[humic acid]]s and [[polyglutamic acid]]  \u2014formed by [[bacteria]]l [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].\n\n;Ionizing radiation\n[[Ionizing radiation]] and [[Photochemistry|photochemical]] oxidants are more damaging in dry regolith, therefore, it may be necessary to reach ~{{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} deep where organic molecules may be shielded by the ice from the surface conditions. The optimal deposition rate for the landing site would be such that {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} of drill will sample through 6 million years of sediment.\n\n;Perchlorate\n[[Perchlorate]] is the most oxidized form of the element [[chlorine]], but it is not reactive at ambient conditions on Mars. However, if heated to above 350&nbsp;\u00b0C perchlorate decomposes and releases reactive chlorine and oxygen. Thus, the ''Viking'' and ''Phoenix'' thermal processing of the soils would have destroyed the very organics they were attempting to detect; thus the lack of detection of organics by ''Viking'', and the detection of chlorinated organic species, may reflect the presence of perchlorates rather than the absence of organics.\n\nOf particular relevance, some microorganisms on Earth grow by the anaerobic reductive dissimilation of perchlorate and one of the specific enzymes used, [[perchlorate reductase]], is present in all known examples of these microorganisms. Also, perchlorates are toxic to humans, so understanding the chemistry and distribution of perchlorate on Mars might become an important prerequisite before the first [[manned mission to Mars]].\n\n===Habitability===\n{{further|Life on Mars}}\nWhile [[sunlight]] is a powerful energy source for life, it is unlikely to be biologically useful on present Mars because it requires life to be at the surface exposed to the extremely lethal radiation and to dry conditions.<ref name=\"Dartnell-1\">{{cite journal |bibcode=2007GeoRL..3402207D |doi=10.1029/2006GL027494 |quote=The damaging effect of ionising radiation on cellular structure is one of the prime limiting factors on the survival of life in potential astrobiological habitats. |title=Modelling the surface and subsurface Martian radiation environment: Implications for astrobiology |date=2007 |last1=Dartnell |first1=L.

''Icebreaker Life'' would study the concentration and distribution of [[ferrous iron]], [[nitrate]], and [[perchlorate]] as a biologically useful [[redox]] couple -or energy source- in the ground ice.  McKay argues that subsurface [[Chemotroph|chemoautotrophy]] is a valid energy alternative for Martian life. He suggests that perchlorate and nitrate could form the oxidizing partner in a redox couple if suitable reduced material were available.\n\n;Nitrogen fixation\nAfter carbon, [[nitrogen]] is arguably the most important element needed for life. Thus, measurements of [[nitrate]] over the range of 0.1% to 5% are required to address the question of its occurrence and distribution. There is nitrogen (as N<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere at low levels, but this is not adequate to support [[nitrogen fixation]] for biological incorporation. Nitrogen in the form of [[nitrate]], if present, could be a resource for human exploration both as a nutrient for plant growth and for use in chemical processes.\n\nOn Earth, nitrates correlate with perchlorates in desert environments, and this may also be true on Mars. Nitrate is expected to be stable on Mars and to have formed in shock and electrical processes. Currently there is no data on its availability.\n\n==Proposed payload==\n[[File:Icebreaker Life drill mission to Mars.jpg|thumb|Members of the \"Icebreaker Life\" team during drill automation testing at the University Valley, Antarctica, a Mars-analog site.]]\n''Icebreaker Life'' would carry a rotary-percussive drill and the proposed scientific instruments have already been tested in relevant analogue environments and on Mars.<ref name=\"update 2014\"/><ref name=\"LPI 2012\"/>\n*[[Signs Of LIfe Detector]] (SOLID) instrument can detect whole cells,  specific complex organic molecules, and polymers via fluorescence [[immunoassay]]s.<ref name=\"Dirt 2013\"/><ref name=\"Centro de Astrobiolog\u00eda\">{{cite web | url = http://auditore.cab.inta-csic.es/solid/en/ | title = SOLID - Signs Of LIfe Detector |accessdate=2014-02-02 | date = 2013 | website = Centro de Astrobiolog\u00eda (CAB) | publisher = [[Spanish National Research Council]] (CAB)}}</ref> Using a single Life-Detection Chip (LDCHIP) measuring a few square centimeters,<ref name=\"SOLID 2012\">{{cite journal| author1= V.Parro, L.

Biomolecules may be present because the ''Phoenix'' landing site is likely to have been habitable in recent Martian history. Ground ice may protect organic molecules on Mars from destruction by oxidants and radiation, and as a result organics from biological or meteorite sources may be detectable in polar ice-rich ground at significant concentrations.\n#\u2002Perform a general search for organic molecules in the ground ice. If habitable conditions were present, then any organics may be of recent (<10\u2009million years) biological origin.\n#\u2002Determine the nature of the ground ice formation and the role of [[Water on Mars|liquid water]]. There may have been liquid water generated in the [[Martian soil|surface soils]] in the north polar regions within the past <10\u2009 million years due to orbital changes in [[insolation]].\n#\u2002Understand the mechanical properties of the martian polar ice-cemented soil. Polar ice may be a resource for human exploration, and the mechanical properties will reflect the stratigraphy of ice and soil, which may inform models of climate history.\n#\u2002Assess the recent habitability of the environment with respect to required elements to support life, energy sources, and possible toxic elements. The perchlorate present at the Phoenix site could provide a usable energy source if ferrous iron is present. A source of fixed nitrogen, such as [[nitrate]], is required for habitability.\n#\u2002Compare the elemental composition of the northern plains with mid-latitude sites.\n\nDuplicate samples could be cached as a target for possible return by a [[Mars sample return mission]].<ref name=\"LPI 2012\"/> If the samples were shown to contain organic [[biosignatures]], interest in returning them to Earth would be high.\n\n==Science==\nThe results from previous missions, and the ''Phoenix'' mission in particular, indicate that the ice-cemented ground in the north polar plains is likely to be the most recently habitable place that is currently known on Mars. The near-surface ice likely provided adequate [[water activity]] (a<sub>w</sub>) during periods of high obliquity 5 million years ago, when Mars had an orbital tilt of 45\u00b0, compared to the present value of 25\u00b0 and ground ice may have melted enough to preserve organic molecules, including organic [[biosignature]]s.\n\nThe two [[Viking program|''Viking'' landers]] conducted in 1976 the first, and so far only, search for current life on Mars. The biology experiments sought to detect living organisms based on the hypothesis that microbial life would be widely present in the soils, as it is on Earth, and that it would respond to [[Growth medium|nutrients added]] with liquid water.

This would lower the risk for biohazards during human exploration or sample return. However, this would not rule out life that does not have Earth-like biomarkers.\n\n===Preservation of biomolecules===\nOne of the key goals of the ''Icebreaker Life'' mission is to test the [[hypothesis]] that the ice-rich ground in the polar regions has significant concentrations of organics due to protection by the ice from [[Oxidizing agent|oxidants]] and [[Sunlight|radiation]].<ref name=\"update 2014\"/> Non-biological organics from infalling meteorites could be detectable in polar ice-rich ground at significant concentrations, so they could be used as indicators that ice actually protect and preserve organic molecules, whether biological or not.\n\nIf non-biological organics are found, then the north polar regions would be compelling targets for future [[astrobiology]] missions, especially because of the potential recent habitability (5 million years ago) of this ice. Target [[biomolecule]]s will be [[aminoacid]]s, [[protein]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, [[nucleic acids]] (''e.g''., [[DNA]], [[RNA]]) and some of their derivatives, [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] involved in [[redox]] reactions, [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] for intracellular signals, and polymeric compounds such as [[humic acid]]s and [[polyglutamic acid]]  \u2014formed by [[bacteria]]l [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].\n\n;Ionizing radiation\n[[Ionizing radiation]] and [[Photochemistry|photochemical]] oxidants are more damaging in dry regolith, therefore, it may be necessary to reach ~{{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} deep where organic molecules may be shielded by the ice from the surface conditions. The optimal deposition rate for the landing site would be such that {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} of drill will sample through 6 million years of sediment.\n\n;Perchlorate\n[[Perchlorate]] is the most oxidized form of the element [[chlorine]], but it is not reactive at ambient conditions on Mars. However, if heated to above 350&nbsp;\u00b0C perchlorate decomposes and releases reactive chlorine and oxygen. Thus, the ''Viking'' and ''Phoenix'' thermal processing of the soils would have destroyed the very organics they were attempting to detect; thus the lack of detection of organics by ''Viking'', and the detection of chlorinated organic species, may reflect the presence of perchlorates rather than the absence of organics.\n\nOf particular relevance, some microorganisms on Earth grow by the anaerobic reductive dissimilation of perchlorate and one of the specific enzymes used, [[perchlorate reductase]], is present in all known examples of these microorganisms. Also, perchlorates are toxic to humans, so understanding the chemistry and distribution of perchlorate on Mars might become an important prerequisite before the first [[manned mission to Mars]].\n\n===Habitability===\n{{further|Life on Mars}}\nWhile [[sunlight]] is a powerful energy source for life, it is unlikely to be biologically useful on present Mars because it requires life to be at the surface exposed to the extremely lethal radiation and to dry conditions.<ref name=\"Dartnell-1\">{{cite journal |bibcode=2007GeoRL..3402207D |doi=10.1029/2006GL027494 |quote=The damaging effect of ionising radiation on cellular structure is one of the prime limiting factors on the survival of life in potential astrobiological habitats. |title=Modelling the surface and subsurface Martian radiation environment: Implications for astrobiology |date=2007 |last1=Dartnell |first1=L.

''Icebreaker Life'' would study the concentration and distribution of [[ferrous iron]], [[nitrate]], and [[perchlorate]] as a biologically useful [[redox]] couple -or energy source- in the ground ice.  McKay argues that subsurface [[Chemotroph|chemoautotrophy]] is a valid energy alternative for Martian life. He suggests that perchlorate and nitrate could form the oxidizing partner in a redox couple if suitable reduced material were available.\n\n;Nitrogen fixation\nAfter carbon, [[nitrogen]] is arguably the most important element needed for life. Thus, measurements of [[nitrate]] over the range of 0.1% to 5% are required to address the question of its occurrence and distribution. There is nitrogen (as N<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere at low levels, but this is not adequate to support [[nitrogen fixation]] for biological incorporation. Nitrogen in the form of [[nitrate]], if present, could be a resource for human exploration both as a nutrient for plant growth and for use in chemical processes.\n\nOn Earth, nitrates correlate with perchlorates in desert environments, and this may also be true on Mars. Nitrate is expected to be stable on Mars and to have formed in shock and electrical processes. Currently there is no data on its availability.\n\n==Proposed payload==\n[[File:Icebreaker Life drill mission to Mars.jpg|thumb|Members of the \"Icebreaker Life\" team during drill automation testing at the University Valley, Antarctica, a Mars-analog site.]]\n''Icebreaker Life'' would carry a rotary-percussive drill and the proposed scientific instruments have already been tested in relevant analogue environments and on Mars.<ref name=\"update 2014\"/><ref name=\"LPI 2012\"/>\n*[[Signs Of LIfe Detector]] (SOLID) instrument can detect whole cells,  specific complex organic molecules, and polymers via fluorescence [[immunoassay]]s.<ref name=\"Dirt 2013\"/><ref name=\"Centro de Astrobiolog\u00eda\">{{cite web | url = http://auditore.cab.inta-csic.es/solid/en/ | title = SOLID - Signs Of LIfe Detector |accessdate=2014-02-02 | date = 2013 | website = Centro de Astrobiolog\u00eda (CAB) | publisher = [[Spanish National Research Council]] (CAB)}}</ref> Using a single Life-Detection Chip (LDCHIP) measuring a few square centimeters,<ref name=\"SOLID 2012\">{{cite journal| author1= V.Parro, L.

It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941.<ref>[http://www.carolinemdavies.co.uk/2012/06/07/collected-poems-john-pudney/ Davies, Caroline. ''Collected Poems, John Pudney'']</ref> Written during an air raid, it was published first in the ''News Chronicle'', and featured significantly in the film ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'':\n\n<poem>\nDo not despair\nFor Johnny-head-in-air;\nHe sleeps as sound\nAs Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud\nFor Johnny-in-the-cloud;\nAnd keep your tears\nFor him in after years.\n\nBetter by far\nFor Johnny-the-bright-star,\nTo keep your head,\nAnd see his children fed.\n</poem>\n\nPudney published several collections of poetry during the war, including ''Dispersal Point'' (1942) and ''South of Forty'' (1943, describing the author's experiences in North Africa). These collections sold over a quarter of a million copies between them.<ref name=white>White, Michael. 'Johnny Head-in-Air', in ''The Guardian'', 6 April, 1972, p 10</ref> One contemporary reviewer, noting that these poems were \"immediately topical and intended to reach a less poetically sophisticated audience\", showed \"how completely he has succeeded in combining the journalist and the poet. That is no easy matter, for the one usually swamps the other\".<ref>''The Listener'', 23 September 1943, p 357</ref>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as a journalist and editor. He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> [[The Net (1953 film)|''The Net'']] was filmed by director [[Anthony Asquith]] in 1953.<ref>Pendo, Stephen. ''Aviation in the Cinema''. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0-8-1081-746-2}}.</ref> His children's books, including the 'Fred and I' series (''Monday Adventure'' etc), and the Hartwarp adventures for younger children, were popular and sold well in the 1950s and 1960s, but haven't remained in print. Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. However, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert, the daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They had two daughters and a son, but were divorced. In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> That process became a subject for his writing. ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.<ref name=dnb/> His grandson [[Toby Perkins]] is the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chesterfield]].\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''Spring Encounter'' (1933)\n*''Open the Sky'' ([[Boriswood]] 1934)\n*''Dispersal Point and other Air Poems'' (1942)\n*''The Grass Grew All Round'' (1942)\n*''Beyond This Disregard'' (1943) poems\n*''South of Forty'' (1943) poems\n*''Ten Summers'': Poems 1933-1943 (1944)\n*''Almanack of Hope'': Sonnets (1944)\n*''Air Force Poetry'' (1944) (anthology, edited with [[Henry Treece|Henry Treece]])\n*''Flight above Cloud'' (1944)\n*''World Still There'' (1945)\n*Selected Poems (1946)\n*''Low Life'' (1947)\n*''Commemorations'' (1948)\n*''Sixpenny Songs'' (1953)\n*Collected Poems (1957)\n*''Spill Out'': Poems and Ballads (1967)\n*''Spandrels'': Poems and Ballads (1969)\n*''Take This Orange'': Poems and Ballads (1971)\n*Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973)\n*''Living in a One-Sided House'' (1976) poems\n*''Writers' Workshop'', poetry anthology publication, editor with [[Norman Hidden]] and [[Michael Johnson (editor)|Michael Johnson]] (from 1967)<ref>Durham University.

He dominated the [[Walpole\u2013Townshend ministry]], as well as the subsequent [[Walpole ministry]], and holds the record as the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by tenure|longest-serving British prime minister in history]]. [[William Arthur Speck|W. A. Speck]] wrote that Walpole's uninterrupted run of 20 years as Prime Minister \"is rightly regarded as one of the major feats of British political history...&nbsp;Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, [and] his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons\".<ref>W. A. Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) p. 203</ref>\n\nWalpole was a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] from the [[gentry]] class who was first elected to Parliament in 1701 and held many senior positions. He was a [[Squire#England|country squire]] and looked to country gentlemen for his political base. Historian Frank O'Gorman says his leadership in Parliament reflected his \"reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence\".<ref>Frank O'Gorman, ''The Long Eighteenth Century: British Political and Social History 1688\u20131832'' (1997), p. 71</ref> Hoppit says Walpole's policies sought moderation: he worked for peace, lower taxes and growing exports and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters. He mostly avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps,<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty? England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p. 410</ref> but his appointment to [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] stock-market crisis drew attention to a perceived protection of political allies by Walpole.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[H. T. Dickinson]] sums up his historical role by saying that \"Walpole was one of the greatest politicians in British history. He played a significant role in sustaining the Whig party, safeguarding the Hanoverian succession, and defending the principles of the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688)....He established a stable political supremacy for the Whig party and taught succeeding ministers how best to establish an effective working relationship between Crown and Parliament\".<ref>[[H. T. Dickinson]], \"Walpole, Sir Robert\", in David Loads, editor, ''Reader's Guide to British History'' (2003) p. 1338</ref>   Scholars rank him highly among all British prime ministers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Strangio|author2=Paul 't Hart|author3=James Walter|title=Understanding Prime-Ministerial Performance: Comparative Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMu2nAZmMbEC&pg=PA225|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|page=225|isbn=9780199666423}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWalpole was born in [[Houghton, Norfolk|Houghton]], [[Norfolk]] in 1676. One of 19 children, he was the third son and fifth child of [[Robert Walpole (1650\u20131700)|Robert Walpole]], a member of the local gentry and a Whig politician who represented the borough of [[Castle Rising]] in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], and his wife Mary Walpole, the daughter and heiress of Sir Geoffrey Burwell of [[Rougham, Suffolk]].  [[Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole]] was his younger brother.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==Education and early business success==\nAs a child, Walpole attended a private school at [[Great Massingham|Massingham, Norfolk]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} Walpole entered [[Eton College]] in 1690{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} where he was considered \"an excellent scholar\". He left Eton on 2 April 1696{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} and matriculated at [[King's College, Cambridge]] on the same day.{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} On 25 May 1698, he left Cambridge after the death of his only remaining elder brother, Edward, so that he could help his father administer the family estate to which he had become the heir. Walpole had planned to become a clergyman but as he was now the eldest surviving son in the family, he abandoned the idea. In November 1700 his father died, and Robert succeeded to inherit the [[Walpole family|Walpole estate]]. A paper in his father's handwriting, dated 9 June 1700, shows the family estate in Norfolk and Suffolk to have been nine manors in Norfolk and one in Suffolk.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nAs a young man, Walpole had bought [[Share (finance)|shares]] in the [[South Sea Company]], which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. However, Walpole had bought at the bottom and sold at the top, adding greatly to his inherited wealth and allowing him to create [[Houghton Hall]] as seen today.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Glentzer|first1=Molly|title='Houghton Hall' peeks at a real 'Downton Abbey'|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/arts-theater/article/Houghton-Hall-peeks-at-a-real-Downton-Abbey-5568249.php|newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date= 20 June 2014|accessdate=5 March 2016|quote=As a young man, Sir Robert bought shares of the South Seas Co., which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. \"But Walpole bought at the bottom and sold at the top,\" Tinterow said. That fortune enabled him to build Houghton.}}</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nWalpole's political career began in January 1701 when he won a seat in the general election at [[Castle Rising (UK Parliament constituency)|Castle Rising]]. He left Castle Rising in 1702 so that he could represent the neighbouring borough of [[King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)|King's Lynn]], a [[pocket borough]] that would re-elect him for the remainder of his political career. Voters and politicians nicknamed him \"Robin\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nLike his father, Robert Walpole was a member of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180, 181}} In 1705, Walpole was appointed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to be a member of the council for her husband, [[Prince George of Denmark]], [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]. After having been singled out in a struggle between the Whigs and the government, Walpole became the intermediary for reconciling the government to the Whig leaders. His abilities were recognised by [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]] (the [[Lord High Treasurer]] and leader of the Cabinet) and he was subsequently appointed to the position of [[Secretary at War]] in 1708; for a short period of time in 1710 he also simultaneously held the post of [[Treasurer of the Navy]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=181\u201382}}\n\nDespite his personal clout, however, Walpole could not stop Lord Godolphin and the Whigs from pressing for the prosecution of [[Henry Sacheverell]], a minister who preached anti-Whig sermons. The trial was extremely unpopular with much of the country, causing the [[Sacheverell riots]], and was followed by the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough and the Whig Party in the general election of 1710. The new ministry, under the leadership of the Tory [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], removed Walpole from his office of Secretary at War but he remained Treasurer of the Navy until 2 January 1711. Harley had first attempted to entice him and then threatened him to join the Tories, but Walpole rejected the offers, instead becoming one of the most outspoken members of the Whig Opposition.  He effectively defended Lord Godolphin against Tory attacks in parliamentary debate, as well as in the press.<ref>Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) pp 206\u20139</ref>\n\nIn 1712, Walpole was accused of [[venality]] and corruption in the matter of two forage contracts for Scotland. Although it was proven that he had retained none of the money, Walpole was pronounced \"guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}} He was impeached by the House of Commons and found guilty by the [[House of Lords]]; he was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] for six months and expelled from Parliament. While in the Tower he was regarded as a political martyr, and visited by all the Whig leaders. After he was released, Walpole wrote and published anonymous pamphlets attacking the Harley ministry and assisted Sir [[Richard Steele]] in crafting political pamphlets. Walpole was re-elected for King's Lynn in 1713.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}}\n\n==Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry==\n{{Main|First Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry|Second Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry}}\nQueen Anne died in 1714. Under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded Roman Catholics from the line of succession, Anne was  succeeded by her [[second cousin]], the [[Elector of Hanover]], [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]. George I distrusted the Tories, who he believed opposed his right to succeed to the Throne. The year of George's accession, 1714, marked the ascendancy of the Whigs who would remain in power for the next fifty years. Robert Walpole became a [[Privy Council of Great Britain|Privy Councillor]] and rose to the position of [[Paymaster of the Forces]]{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184}} in a Cabinet nominally led by [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], but actually dominated by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]] (Walpole's brother-in-law) and [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]]. Walpole was also appointed chairman of a secret committee formed to investigate the actions of the previous Tory ministry in 1715.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cihm_20078 archive.org: \"A Report from the Committee of Secrecy, appointed by order of the House of Commons: to examine several books and papers laid before the House, relating to the late negociations of peace and commerce, &c. : reported on the ninth of June, 1715\"] by Robert Walpole, Chairman</ref> [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] was impeached, and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Lord Bolingbroke]] suffered from an [[Bill of attainder|act of attainder]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184}}\n\nLord Halifax, the titular head of the administration, died in 1715 and by 1716 Walpole was appointed to the posts of [[First Lord of the Treasury|First Commissioner (Lord) of the Treasury]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He was a  member of the ''Board of General Officers'' established in 1717 to investigate the abuse of pay. Walpole's fellow members, appointed by the [[George II of Great Britain|Prince of Wales]], included  [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath]] \u2013 Secretary at War, General Lumley, General Erle and [[Sir Philip Meadowes]] \u2013 Controller of the Army and [[Knight Marshal]] of the King's Palace,<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|last1=Oldmixon|first1=Mr (John)|title=The History of England: During the Reigns of King William and Queen Mary, Queen Anne, King George I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvsiAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA627|publisher=T.

Normally, Walpole and Lord Townshend were on one side, with Stanhope and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] on the other. Foreign policy was the primary issue of contention; George I was thought to be conducting foreign affairs with the interests of his German territories, rather than those of Great Britain, at heart. The Stanhope\u2013Sunderland faction, however, had the King's support. In 1716 Townshend had been removed from the important post of [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department|Northern Secretary]] and put in the lesser office of [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=185}} Even this change did not appease Stanhope and Sunderland who secured the dismissal of Townshend from the Lord-Lieutenancy in April 1717.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=185}} On the next day, Walpole resigned from the Cabinet to join the Opposition \"because I could not connive at some things that were carrying on\",<ref>{{harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=185}} cites ''Parl.

He used his influence to prevent George II from entering the [[War of the Polish Succession]] in 1733, because it was a dispute between the Bourbons and the Habsburgs. He boasted, \"There are 50,000 men slain in Europe this year, and not one Englishman.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=C. Grant Robertson|title=England under the Hanoverians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVG7Nls67aQC&pg=PA66|year=1921|page=66}}</ref> By avoiding wars, Walpole could lower taxes.  He reduced the national debt with a sinking fund, and by negotiating lower interest rates.  He reduced the land tax from four shillings in 1721, to 3s in 1728, 2s in 1731 and finally to only 1s in 1732.  His long-term goal was to replace the land tax, which was paid by the local gentry, with excise and customs taxes, which were paid by merchants and ultimately by consumers.  Walpole joked that the landed gentry resembled hogs, which squealed loudly whenever anyone laid hands on him.  By contrast, he said, merchants were like sheep, and yielded their wool without complaint.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.W.

To reduce the threat of smuggling, the tax was to be collected not at ports but at warehouses. This new proposal, however, was extremely unpopular and aroused the opposition of the nation's merchants. Walpole agreed to withdraw the bill before Parliament voted on it, but he dismissed the politicians who had dared to oppose it in the first place. Thus, Walpole lost a considerable element of his Whig Party to the Opposition.<ref>Paul Langford, ''A polite and commercial people: England, 1727-1783'' (1998). pp 28-33</ref>\n\nAfter the general elections of 1734, Walpole's supporters still formed a majority in the House of Commons although they were less numerous than before.

His opponents acquired a vocal leader in the [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] who was estranged from his father, the King.

These constituencies returned members of parliament hostile to the Prime Minister. Similarly, the influence of the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] secured the election of members opposed to Walpole in some parts of Scotland.

After his resignation, his main political roles were to support the government by means of advice, to dole out some patronage and to speak on the ministry's behalf in the Lords.<ref>Jonathan Oates, \"Sir Robert Walpole after his Fall from Power, 1742\u20131745.\" ''History 91.302'' (2006): 218-230.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nLord Orford was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington|Lord Wilmington]] in an administration whose true head was [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]]. A committee was created to inquire into Walpole's ministry but no substantial evidence of wrongdoing or corruption was discovered. Though no longer a member of the Cabinet, Orford continued to maintain personal influence with George II and was often dubbed the \"Minister behind the Curtain\" for this advice and influence. In 1744 he managed to secure the dismissal of Carteret and the appointment of [[Henry Pelham]] whom he regarded as a political prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He advised Pelham to make use of his seat in the Commons to serve as a bridge between the King and Parliament, just as Walpole had done.{{sfn|Browning|1975|p=117}}<ref>{{citation |first=Jonathan |last=Aotes |title=Sir Robert Walpole after his Fall from Power, 1742\u20131745 |journal=History |date=April 2006 |volume=91 |issue=302 |pages=218\u2013230 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-229x.2006.00364.x}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Walpole also made two interventions in the Lords. The first was in January 1744 in the debate on Hanoverian troops being kept in British pay. Walpole prevented them from losing the troops. In his second intervention, Walpole, with fear of a Jacobite-inspired invasion in February 1744, made a speech on the situation. Frederick, Prince of Wales, usually hostile to Walpole, warmly received him at his court the next day, most likely because his father's throne, and the future of the whole Hanoverian dynasty, was at risk from the Stuart Pretender.<ref name=\"npg.org.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw04757/Robert-Walpole-1st-Earl-of-Orford|title=Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford - National Portrait Gallery|language=en|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlong with his political interests in his last years, Walpole enjoyed the pleasures of the hunt. Back at his recently rebuilt country seat in Houghton, Norfolk, such pastimes were denied him due to \"dismal weather\".<ref>BL Add.

He had spent much money in the 1720s and 1730s in building up a collection of Old Masters from all over Europe. Walpole also concerned himself with estate matters.<ref name=\"npg.org.uk\"/>\n\nHis health, never good, deteriorated rapidly toward the end of 1744; Orford died in London in 1745, aged nearly sixty-nine years; he was buried in the [[parish church]] of St Martin in [[Houghton, Norfolk]].<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101077787-church-of-st-martin-houghton#.WRQMsVTTWhA Church of St Martin, Houghton, Norfolk], British Listed Buildings, accessed 11 May 2017.</ref> His earldom passed to his eldest son Robert who was in turn succeeded by his only son George.

The Tories became a minor, insignificant faction, and the Whigs became a dominant and largely unopposed party. His influence on the development of the uncodified [[constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution of Great Britain]] was less momentous even though he is regarded as Great Britain's first Prime Minister.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} He relied primarily on the favour of the King rather than on the support of the House of Commons. His power stemmed from his personal influence instead of the influence of his office. Most of his immediate successors were, comparatively speaking, extremely weak; it would take several decades more for the premiership to develop into the most powerful and most important office in the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWalpole's strategy of keeping Great Britain at peace contributed greatly to the country's prosperity. Walpole also managed to secure the position of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian Dynasty]], and effectively countervailed Jacobitism. The Jacobite threat ended, soon after Walpole's term ended, with the defeat of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|rebellion of 1745]]. Later in the century, the Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]] \"admitted him into the whig pantheon\".<ref>{{cite ODNB|last=Taylor |first=Stephen |id=28601 |title=Walpole, Robert, first earl of Orford (1676\u20131745) |origyear=2004 |date=January 2008 |mode=cs2}}</ref> Burke wrote:\n\n{{quote|He was an honorable man and a sound Whig. He was not, as the Jacobites and discontented Whigs of his time have represented him, and as ill-informed people still represent him, a prodigal and corrupt minister. They charged him in their libels and seditious conversations as having first reduced corruption to a system. Such was their cant. But he was far from governing by corruption. He governed by party attachments. The charge of systematic corruption is less applicable to him, perhaps, than to any minister who ever served the crown for so great a length of time. He gained over very few from the Opposition. Without being a genius of the first class, he was an intelligent, prudent, and safe minister. He loved peace; and he helped to communicate the same disposition to nations at least as warlike and restless as that in which he had the chief direction of affairs. ... With many virtues, public and private, he had his faults; but his faults were superficial. A careless, coarse, and over familiar style of discourse, without sufficient regard to persons or occasions, and an almost total want of political decorum, were the errours by which he was most hurt in the public opinion: and those through which his enemies obtained the greatest advantage over him. But justice must be done. The prudence, steadiness, and vigilance of that man, joined to the greatest possible lenity in his character and his politics, preserved the crown to this royal family; and with it, their laws and liberties to this country.<ref>{{citation |last=Burke |first=Edmund |title=An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs |publisher=The Library of Liberal Arts |year=1962|pages=62\u201363}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] expressed scepticism as to whether \"an impartial Character of Sr Robert Walpole, will or can be transmitted to Posterity, for he governed this Kingdom so long that the various passions of Mankind mingled, and in a manner incorporated themselves, with every thing that was said or writt concerning him. Never was Man more flattered nor more abused, and his long power, was probably the chief cause of both\".{{sfn|Franklin|1993|p=114}} Chesterfield claimed he was \"much acquainted with him both in his publick and his private life\":\n\n{{quote|In private life he was good natured, Chearfull, social. Inelegant in his manners, loose in his morals. He had a coarse wit, which he was too free of for a Man in his Station, as it is always inconsistent with dignity. He was very able as a Minister, but without a certain Elevation of mind...He was both the ablest Parliament man, and the ablest manager of a Parliament, that I believe ever lived...Money, not Prerogative, was the chief Engine of his administration, and he employed it with a success that in a manner disgraced humanity...When he found any body proof, against pecuniary temptations, which alass! was but seldom, he had recourse to still a worse art. For he laughed at and ridiculed all notions of Publick virtue, and the love of one's Country, calling them the ''Chimerical school boy flights of Classical learning''; declaring himself at the same time, ''No Saint, no Spartan, no reformer''. He would frequently ask young fellows at their first appearance in the world, while their honest hearts were yet untainted, ''well are you to be an old Roman? a Patriot? you will soon come off of that, and grow wiser''. And thus he was more dangerous to the morals, than to the libertys of his country, to which I am persuaded that he meaned no ill in his heart. ... His Name will not be recorded in History among the best men, or the best Ministers, but much much less ought it to be ranked among the worst.{{sfn|Franklin|1993|pp=114\u2013115}} }}\n\n[[10 Downing Street]] represents another part of Walpole's legacy. George II offered this home to Walpole as a personal gift in 1732, but Walpole accepted it only as the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, taking up his residence there on 22 September 1735. His immediate successors did not always reside in Number 10 (preferring their larger private residences) but the home has nevertheless become established as the official residence of the Prime Minister (in his or her capacity as First Lord of the Treasury).<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica\"/>\n\nWalpole has attracted attention from heterodox economists as a pioneer of protectionist policies, in the form of tariffs and subsidies to woollen manufacturers. As a result, the industry became Britain's primary export, enabling the country to import the raw materials and food that fueled the industrial revolution.<ref>{{cite book|title=23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism|author=Ha-Joon Chang|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|page=70}}</ref>\n\nWalpole is immortalised in [[St Stephen's Hall]], where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to Parliament.<ref name=ssstat>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palace-s-interiors/st-stephen-s-hall/|title=St Stephen's Hall|website=UK Parliament}}</ref>\n\nWalpole built [[Houghton Hall]] in Norfolk as his country seat.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWalpole also left behind a [[Walpole collection|collection of art]] which he had assembled during his career.

\"KG, KB\": he resigned the Bath on appointment to the Garter in 1726--> (26 August 1676 \u2013 18 March 1745), known between 1721 and 1742 as '''Sir Robert Walpole''', was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] politician who is generally regarded as the ''[[de facto]]'' first [[Prime Minister of Great Britain]].\n\nAlthough the exact dates of Walpole's dominance, dubbed the \"Robinocracy\",<ref>{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|Robinocracy}}</ref> are a matter of scholarly debate, the period 1721\u20131742 is often used. He dominated the [[Walpole\u2013Townshend ministry]], as well as the subsequent [[Walpole ministry]], and holds the record as the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by tenure|longest-serving British prime minister in history]]. [[William Arthur Speck|W. A. Speck]] wrote that Walpole's uninterrupted run of 20 years as Prime Minister \"is rightly regarded as one of the major feats of British political history...&nbsp;Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, [and] his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons\".<ref>W. A. Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) p. 203</ref>\n\nWalpole was a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] from the [[gentry]] class who was first elected to Parliament in 1701 and held many senior positions. He was a [[Squire#England|country squire]] and looked to country gentlemen for his political base. Historian Frank O'Gorman says his leadership in Parliament reflected his \"reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence\".<ref>Frank O'Gorman, ''The Long Eighteenth Century: British Political and Social History 1688\u20131832'' (1997), p. 71</ref> Hoppit says Walpole's policies sought moderation: he worked for peace, lower taxes and growing exports and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters. He mostly avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps, <ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty? England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p. 410</ref> but his appointment to [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] stock-market crisis drew attention to a perceived protection of political allies by Walpole.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[H. T. Dickinson]] sums up his historical role by saying that \"Walpole was one of the greatest politicians in British history. He played a significant role in sustaining the Whig party, safeguarding the Hanoverian succession, and defending the principles of the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688)....He established a stable political supremacy for the Whig party and taught succeeding ministers how best to establish an effective working relationship between Crown and Parliament\".<ref>[[H. T. Dickinson]], \"Walpole, Sir Robert\", in David Loads, editor, ''Reader's Guide to British History'' (2003) p. 1338</ref>   Scholars rank him highly among all British prime ministers. <ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Strangio|author2=Paul 't Hart|author3=James Walter|title=Understanding Prime-Ministerial Performance: Comparative Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMu2nAZmMbEC&pg=PA225|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|page=225|isbn=9780199666423}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWalpole was born in [[Houghton, Norfolk|Houghton]], [[Norfolk]] in 1676. One of 19 children, he was the third son and fifth child of [[Robert Walpole (1650\u20131700)|Robert Walpole]], a member of the local gentry and a Whig politician who represented the borough of [[Castle Rising]] in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], and his wife Mary Walpole, the daughter and heiress of Sir Geoffrey Burwell of [[Rougham, Suffolk]].  [[Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole]] was his younger brother.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==Education and early business success==\nAs a child, Walpole attended a private school at [[Great Massingham|Massingham, Norfolk]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} Walpole entered [[Eton College]] in 1690{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} where he was considered \"an excellent scholar\". He left Eton on 2 April 1696{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} and matriculated at [[King's College, Cambridge]] on the same day.{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} On 25 May 1698, he left Cambridge after the death of his only remaining elder brother, Edward, so that he could help his father administer the family estate to which he had become the heir. Walpole had planned to become a clergyman but as he was now the eldest surviving son in the family, he abandoned the idea. In November 1700 his father died, and Robert succeeded to inherit the [[Walpole family|Walpole estate]]. A paper in his father's handwriting, dated 9 June 1700, shows the family estate in Norfolk and Suffolk to have been nine manors in Norfolk and one in Suffolk.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nAs a young man, Walpole had bought [[Share (finance)|shares]] in the [[South Sea Company]], which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. However, Walpole had bought at the bottom and sold at the top, adding greatly to his inherited wealth and allowing him to create [[Houghton Hall]] as seen today.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Glentzer|first1=Molly|title='Houghton Hall' peeks at a real 'Downton Abbey'|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/arts-theater/article/Houghton-Hall-peeks-at-a-real-Downton-Abbey-5568249.php|newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date= 20 June 2014|accessdate=5 March 2016|quote=As a young man, Sir Robert bought shares of the South Seas Co., which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. \"But Walpole bought at the bottom and sold at the top,\" Tinterow said. That fortune enabled him to build Houghton.}}</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nWalpole's political career began in January 1701 when he won a seat in the general election at [[Castle Rising (UK Parliament constituency)|Castle Rising]]. He left Castle Rising in 1702 so that he could represent the neighbouring borough of [[King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)|King's Lynn]], a [[pocket borough]] that would re-elect him for the remainder of his political career. Voters and politicians nicknamed him \"Robin\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nLike his father, Robert Walpole was a member of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180, 181}} In 1705, Walpole was appointed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to be a member of the council for her husband, [[Prince George of Denmark]], [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]. After having been singled out in a struggle between the Whigs and the government, Walpole became the intermediary for reconciling the government to the Whig leaders. His abilities were recognised by [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]] (the [[Lord High Treasurer]] and leader of the Cabinet) and he was subsequently appointed to the position of [[Secretary at War]] in 1708; for a short period of time in 1710 he also simultaneously held the post of [[Treasurer of the Navy]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=181\u201382}}\n\nDespite his personal clout, however, Walpole could not stop Lord Godolphin and the Whigs from pressing for the prosecution of [[Henry Sacheverell]], a minister who preached anti-Whig sermons. The trial was extremely unpopular with much of the country, causing the [[Sacheverell riots]], and was followed by the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough and the Whig Party in the general election of 1710. The new ministry, under the leadership of the Tory [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], removed Walpole from his office of Secretary at War but he remained Treasurer of the Navy until 2 January 1711. Harley had first attempted to entice him and then threatened him to join the Tories, but Walpole rejected the offers, instead becoming one of the most outspoken members of the Whig Opposition.  He effectively defended Lord Godolphin against Tory attacks in parliamentary debate, as well as in the press.<ref>Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) pp 206\u20139</ref>\n\nIn 1712, Walpole was accused of [[venality]] and corruption in the matter of two forage contracts for Scotland. Although it was proven that he had retained none of the money, Walpole was pronounced \"guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}} He was impeached by the House of Commons and found guilty by the [[House of Lords]]; he was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] for six months and expelled from Parliament. While in the Tower he was regarded as a political martyr, and visited by all the Whig leaders. After he was released, Walpole wrote and published anonymous pamphlets attacking the Harley ministry and assisted Sir [[Richard Steele]] in crafting political pamphlets. Walpole was re-elected for King's Lynn in 1713.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}}\n\n==Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry==\n{{Main|First Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry|Second Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry}}\nQueen Anne died in 1714. Under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded Roman Catholics from the line of succession, Anne was  succeeded by her [[second cousin]], the [[Elector of Hanover]], [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]. George I distrusted the Tories, who he believed opposed his right to succeed to the Throne. The year of George's accession, 1714, marked the ascendancy of the Whigs who would remain in power for the next fifty years. Robert Walpole became a [[Privy Council of Great Britain|Privy Councillor]] and rose to the position of [[Paymaster of the Forces]]{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184}} in a Cabinet nominally led by [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], but actually dominated by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]] (Walpole's brother-in-law) and [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]]. Walpole was also appointed chairman of a secret committee formed to investigate the actions of the previous Tory ministry in 1715.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cihm_20078 archive.org: \"A Report from the Committee of Secrecy, appointed by order of the House of Commons: to examine several books and papers laid before the House, relating to the late negociations of peace and commerce, &c. : reported on the ninth of June, 1715\"] by Robert Walpole, Chairman</ref> [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] was impeached, and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Lord Bolingbroke]] suffered from an [[Bill of attainder|act of attainder]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184}}\n\nLord Halifax, the titular head of the administration, died in 1715 and by 1716 Walpole was appointed to the posts of [[First Lord of the Treasury|First Commissioner (Lord) of the Treasury]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He was a  member of the ''Board of General Officers'' established in 1717 to investigate the abuse of pay. Walpole's fellow members, appointed by the [[George II of Great Britain|Prince of Wales]], included  [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath]] \u2013 Secretary at War, General Lumley, General Erle and [[Sir Philip Meadowes]] \u2013 Controller of the Army and [[Knight Marshal]] of the King's Palace,<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|last1=Oldmixon|first1=Mr (John)|title=The History of England: During the Reigns of King William and Queen Mary, Queen Anne, King George I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvsiAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA627|publisher=T.

He boasted, \"There are 50,000 men slain in Europe this year, and not one Englishman.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=C. Grant Robertson|title=England under the Hanoverians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVG7Nls67aQC&pg=PA66|year=1921|page=66}}</ref> By avoiding wars, Walpole could lower taxes.  He reduced the national debt with a sinking fund, and by negotiating lower interest rates.  He reduced the land tax from four shillings in 1721, to 3s in 1728, 2s in 1731 and finally to only 1s in 1732.  His long-term goal was to replace the land tax, which was paid by the local gentry, with excise and customs taxes, which were paid by merchants and ultimately by consumers.  Walpole joked that the landed gentry resembled hogs, which squealed loudly whenever anyone laid hands on him.  By contrast, he said, merchants were like sheep, and yielded their wool without complaint.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.W.

To reduce the threat of smuggling, the tax was to be collected not at ports but at warehouses. This new proposal, however, was extremely unpopular and aroused the opposition of the nation's merchants. Walpole agreed to withdraw the bill before Parliament voted on it, but he dismissed the politicians who had dared to oppose it in the first place. Thus, Walpole lost a considerable element of his Whig Party to the Opposition.<ref>Paul Langford, ''A polite and commercial people: England, 1727-1783'' (1998). pp 28-33</ref>\n\nAfter the general elections of 1734, Walpole's supporters still formed a majority in the House of Commons although they were less numerous than before.

In general the government made gains in England and [[Wales]] but this was not enough to overturn the reverses of the [[1734 British general election|1734 election]] and further losses in [[Cornwall]] where many constituencies were obedient to the will of the Prince of Wales (who was also [[Duke of Cornwall]]). These constituencies returned members of parliament hostile to the Prime Minister. Similarly, the influence of the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] secured the election of members opposed to Walpole in some parts of Scotland. Walpole's new majority was difficult to determine because of the uncertain loyalties of many new members, but contemporaries and historians estimated it as low as fourteen to eighteen.<ref>{{Citation |last=Speck|first=W.

Moreover, his majority was not as strong as it had formerly been, his detractors\u2014such as William Pulteney, earl of Bath, and Lord Perceval\u2014being approximately as numerous as his supporters. Behind these political enemies were opposition Whigs, Tories and Jacobites. Walpole was alleged to have presided over an immense increase in corruption and to have enriched himself enormously whilst in office. Parliamentary committees were formed to investigate these charges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/robert-walpole|title=History of Sir Robert Walpole - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> In 1742 when the House of Commons was prepared to determine the validity of a by-election in [[Chippenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chippenham]], Walpole and others agreed to treat the issue as a [[motion of no confidence]]. As Walpole was defeated on the vote, he agreed to resign from the Government. The news of the naval disaster against Spain in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] also prompted the end of his political career. King George II wept on his resignation and begged to see him frequently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/gov/primes/prime1.html|title=British Prime Ministers: Sir Robert Walpole|website=www.britannia.com|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> As part of his resignation the King agreed to elevate him to the House of Lords as the [[Earl of Orford]], Viscount Walpole and [[Baron Walpole|Baron Walpole of Houghton]] in the County of Norfolk, this occurred on 6 February 1742.

His former colleagues were still pleased to see him, perhaps in part because he retained the king's favour. After his resignation, his main political roles were to support the government by means of advice, to dole out some patronage and to speak on the ministry's behalf in the Lords.<ref>Jonathan Oates, \"Sir Robert Walpole after his Fall from Power, 1742\u20131745.\" ''History 91.302'' (2006): 218-230.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nLord Orford was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington|Lord Wilmington]] in an administration whose true head was [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]]. A committee was created to inquire into Walpole's ministry but no substantial evidence of wrongdoing or corruption was discovered. Though no longer a member of the Cabinet, Orford continued to maintain personal influence with George II and was often dubbed the \"Minister behind the Curtain\" for this advice and influence. In 1744 he managed to secure the dismissal of Carteret and the appointment of [[Henry Pelham]] whom he regarded as a political prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He advised Pelham to make use of his seat in the Commons to serve as a bridge between the King and Parliament, just as Walpole had done.{{sfn|Browning|1975|p=117}}<ref>{{citation |first=Jonathan |last=Aotes |title=Sir Robert Walpole after his Fall from Power, 1742\u20131745 |journal=History |date=April 2006 |volume=91 |issue=302 |pages=218\u2013230 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-229x.2006.00364.x}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Walpole also made two interventions in the Lords. The first was in January 1744 in the debate on Hanoverian troops being kept in British pay. Walpole prevented them from losing the troops. In his second intervention, Walpole, with fear of a Jacobite-inspired invasion in February 1744, made a speech on the situation. Frederick, Prince of Wales, usually hostile to Walpole, warmly received him at his court the next day, most likely because his father's throne, and the future of the whole Hanoverian dynasty, was at risk from the Stuart Pretender.<ref name=\"npg.org.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw04757/Robert-Walpole-1st-Earl-of-Orford|title=Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford - National Portrait Gallery|language=en|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlong with his political interests in his last years, Walpole enjoyed the pleasures of the hunt. Back at his recently rebuilt country seat in Houghton, Norfolk, such pastimes were denied him due to \"dismal weather\".<ref>BL Add.

He had spent much money in the 1720s and 1730s in building up a collection of Old Masters from all over Europe. Walpole also concerned himself with estate matters.<ref name=\"npg.org.uk\"/>\n\nHis health, never good, deteriorated rapidly toward the end of 1744; Orford died in London in 1745, aged nearly sixty-nine years; he was buried in the [[parish church]] of St Martin in [[Houghton, Norfolk]].<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101077787-church-of-st-martin-houghton#.WRQMsVTTWhA Church of St Martin, Houghton, Norfolk], British Listed Buildings, accessed 11 May 2017.</ref> His earldom passed to his eldest son Robert who was in turn succeeded by his only son George.

The Tories became a minor, insignificant faction, and the Whigs became a dominant and largely unopposed party. His influence on the development of the uncodified [[constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution of Great Britain]] was less momentous even though he is regarded as Great Britain's first Prime Minister.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} He relied primarily on the favour of the King rather than on the support of the House of Commons. His power stemmed from his personal influence instead of the influence of his office. Most of his immediate successors were, comparatively speaking, extremely weak; it would take several decades more for the premiership to develop into the most powerful and most important office in the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWalpole's strategy of keeping Great Britain at peace contributed greatly to the country's prosperity. Walpole also managed to secure the position of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian Dynasty]], and effectively countervailed Jacobitism. The Jacobite threat ended, soon after Walpole's term ended, with the defeat of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|rebellion of 1745]]. Later in the century, the Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]] \"admitted him into the whig pantheon\".<ref>{{cite ODNB|last=Taylor |first=Stephen |id=28601 |title=Walpole, Robert, first earl of Orford (1676\u20131745) |origyear=2004 |date=January 2008 |mode=cs2}}</ref> Burke wrote:\n\n{{quote|He was an honorable man and a sound Whig. He was not, as the Jacobites and discontented Whigs of his time have represented him, and as ill-informed people still represent him, a prodigal and corrupt minister. They charged him in their libels and seditious conversations as having first reduced corruption to a system. Such was their cant. But he was far from governing by corruption. He governed by party attachments. The charge of systematic corruption is less applicable to him, perhaps, than to any minister who ever served the crown for so great a length of time. He gained over very few from the Opposition. Without being a genius of the first class, he was an intelligent, prudent, and safe minister. He loved peace; and he helped to communicate the same disposition to nations at least as warlike and restless as that in which he had the chief direction of affairs. ... With many virtues, public and private, he had his faults; but his faults were superficial. A careless, coarse, and over familiar style of discourse, without sufficient regard to persons or occasions, and an almost total want of political decorum, were the errours by which he was most hurt in the public opinion: and those through which his enemies obtained the greatest advantage over him. But justice must be done. The prudence, steadiness, and vigilance of that man, joined to the greatest possible lenity in his character and his politics, preserved the crown to this royal family; and with it, their laws and liberties to this country.<ref>{{citation |last=Burke |first=Edmund |title=An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs |publisher=The Library of Liberal Arts |year=1962|pages=62\u201363}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] expressed scepticism as to whether \"an impartial Character of Sr Robert Walpole, will or can be transmitted to Posterity, for he governed this Kingdom so long that the various passions of Mankind mingled, and in a manner incorporated themselves, with every thing that was said or writt concerning him. Never was Man more flattered nor more abused, and his long power, was probably the chief cause of both\".{{sfn|Franklin|1993|p=114}} Chesterfield claimed he was \"much acquainted with him both in his publick and his private life\":\n\n{{quote|In private life he was good natured, Chearfull, social. Inelegant in his manners, loose in his morals. He had a coarse wit, which he was too free of for a Man in his Station, as it is always inconsistent with dignity. He was very able as a Minister, but without a certain Elevation of mind...He was both the ablest Parliament man, and the ablest manager of a Parliament, that I believe ever lived...Money, not Prerogative, was the chief Engine of his administration, and he employed it with a success that in a manner disgraced humanity...When he found any body proof, against pecuniary temptations, which alass! was but seldom, he had recourse to still a worse art. For he laughed at and ridiculed all notions of Publick virtue, and the love of one's Country, calling them the ''Chimerical school boy flights of Classical learning''; declaring himself at the same time, ''No Saint, no Spartan, no reformer''. He would frequently ask young fellows at their first appearance in the world, while their honest hearts were yet untainted, ''well are you to be an old Roman? a Patriot? you will soon come off of that, and grow wiser''. And thus he was more dangerous to the morals, than to the libertys of his country, to which I am persuaded that he meaned no ill in his heart. ... His Name will not be recorded in History among the best men, or the best Ministers, but much much less ought it to be ranked among the worst.{{sfn|Franklin|1993|pp=114\u2013115}} }}\n\n[[10 Downing Street]] represents another part of Walpole's legacy. George II offered this home to Walpole as a personal gift in 1732, but Walpole accepted it only as the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, taking up his residence there on 22 September 1735. His immediate successors did not always reside in Number 10 (preferring their larger private residences) but the home has nevertheless become established as the official residence of the Prime Minister (in his or her capacity as First Lord of the Treasury).<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica\"/>\n\nWalpole has attracted attention from heterodox economists as a pioneer of protectionist policies, in the form of tariffs and subsidies to woollen manufacturers. As a result, the industry became Britain's primary export, enabling the country to import the raw materials and food that fueled the industrial revolution.<ref>{{cite book|title=23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism|author=Ha-Joon Chang|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|page=70}}</ref>\n\nWalpole is immortalised in [[St Stephen's Hall]], where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to Parliament.<ref name=ssstat>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palace-s-interiors/st-stephen-s-hall/|title=St Stephen's Hall|website=UK Parliament}}</ref>\n\nWalpole built [[Houghton Hall]] in Norfolk as his country seat.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWalpole also left behind a [[Walpole collection|collection of art]] which he had assembled during his career.
