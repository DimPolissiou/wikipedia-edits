Plans also call for adding entrances and concourses to the adjacent [[James A. Farley Building]]. The Farley Post Office was built as a companion to the 1910 station.

Along with Long Island Rail Road trains, Penn Station saw trains of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]] and the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]]s. A side effect of the tunneling project was to open the city up to the [[suburb]]s, and within 10 years of opening, two-thirds of the daily passengers coming through Penn Station were commuters.<ref name=\"riseandfallofpennstation\"/> The station put the Pennsylvania Railroad at comparative advantage to its competitors offering direct service from Manhattan to the west and south. Other railroads began their routes at terminals in [[Weehawken Terminal|Weehawken]], [[Hoboken Terminal|Hoboken]], [[Pavonia Terminal|Pavonia]] and [[Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal|Communipaw]] which required passengers from New York City to take the interstate Hudson Tubes (now [[PATH (rail system)|PATH]]) or ferries across the Hudson River before boarding their trains. By 1945, at its peak, more than 100 million passengers a year traveled through Penn Station.<ref name=\"riseandfallofpennstation\" />\n\nBy the late 1950s, intercity rail passenger volumes had declined dramatically with the coming of the [[Jet Age]] and the [[Interstate Highway System]].

The cost and timeline of the Empire Station project was not announced. The project is a breakout from the larger Gateway Program, allowing construction of the annex to proceed independently from the project to build two additional North River tunnels to New

Plans also call for adding entrances and concourses to the adjacent [[James A. Farley Building]]. The Farley Post Office was built as a companion to the 1910 station.

It was formed in response to the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s. Between 1801 and 1818, the squadron was composed of a series of rotating squadrons.  Later, squadrons were sent in the 1820s to the 1860s to suppress [[piracy]], primarily in [[Greece]] and to engage in [[gunboat diplomacy]].<ref name=\"Barbary Corsairs\">{{cite book|isbn=|oclc=|title=Our Navy and the Barbary Corsairs|url=https://archive.org/details/ournavybarbaryco00alle|last=Allen| first=Gardner Weld|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Chester|year=1905}}</ref> In 1865 the force was renamed the [[European Squadron]].\n\n==History==\n\n===First Barbary War===\n{{main|First Barbary War}}\nThe [[Barbary pirates]]' seizure of American merchant ships went back to just after the [[American War of Independence|victory]] over [[Great Britain]] in 1783. When the [[Dey of Algiers]] demanded tribute, the Americans refused and thus began a long series of conflict between the Barbary states and the United States lasting from the 1780s to 1815. The Mediterranean Squadron was created for the protection of American merchant ships sailing in Mediterranean waters.\nThe first squadron sent was under the command of [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Richard Dale]]. His command included the [[frigate]]s {{USS|Boston|1799|6}}, {{USS|Essex|1799|6}}, {{USS|Philadelphia|1799|6}} and {{USS|President|1800|6}} as well as the [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|George Washington|1798|6}} and the [[schooner]] {{USS|Enterprise|1799|6}}. During the squadron's deployment from 1801 to 1802, it operated by convoying merchant ships. Commodore Dale did not have orders to capture enemy vessels and could only respond to the North African's attacks if fired upon first or if coming to the aid of a merchant ship. On August 1, 1801, the twelve gun schooner USS ''Enterprise'' under the command of Lieutenant [[Andrew Sterett]] encountered the fourteen gun [[Tripoli]]tan [[polacca]] named ''Tripoli''. USS ''Enterprise'' captured ''Tripoli'' after a long and bloody [[Action of 1 August 1801|fight]] but because the squadron could not legally make a prize of the ship, it was stripped of its fighting capabilities and released.\n[[File:Burning of the uss philadelphia.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''The burning of USS Philadelphia by the crew of USS Intrepid, 1804.'']]\nAs attacks on merchantmen continued, the United States government eventually authorized the United States Navy to send a second squadron to blockade Tripoli and attack their ships. In May 1802 Captain [[Daniel McNeill]] in USS ''Boston'' assisted two [[Sweden|Swedish]] frigates in a [[First Battle of Tripoli Harbor|battle]] while blockading Tripoli. In the action several Barbary vessels sortied and the Americans and Swedish frigates fought off the attack which then forced the Tripolitans back into harbor. In June 1803, USS ''John Adams'' and USS ''Enterprise'' [[Action of 22 June 1803|defeated]] nine enemy gunboats and a [[polacre]] near Tripoli. The polacre was sunk and the gunboats forced to flee, the Americans suffered no casualties. The second squadron returned to the United States in 1803 and that same year another force was sent and operated until 1804. On October 31, 1803, USS ''Philadelphia'' grounded on a reef just off [[Tripoli Harbor]]. Under heavy fire from enemy [[shore battery|shore batteries]] the Americans attempted to refloat their ship but she was hard aground. When Tripolitan gunboats approached for her capture, her commander surrendered his ship and was made a slave along with the crew. ''Philadelphia'' was then manned by the Tripolitans as a sort of harbor defence until February 16, 1804. On that night Lieutenant [[Stephen Decatur]] in the [[ketch]] {{USS|Intrepid|1798|6}} boarded and [[Second Battle of Tripoli Harbor|recaptured]] ''Philadelphia'' and [[scuttled]] her by fire. This was the most remembered action in the battle for Tripoli. Decatur became famous immediately after this and had a long career of serving the American navy with distinction. He later commanded American forces during the [[Second Barbary War]] in 1815.\n\nAt the final [[Battle of Derne|engagement]] of the war in April and May 1805, the [[brig]] {{USS|Argus|1803|6}}, the schooner {{USS|Nautilus|1799|6}} and the sloop {{USS|Hornet|1805 sloop|6}} provided gun support for ten American marines and soldiers leading a [[mercenary]] army against [[Derna, Libya|Derne]]. During the battle the Mediterranean Squadron vessels under [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] bombarded the city while the land forces besieged the Tripolitan garrison. When the city finally fell, the Dey of Algiers surrendered and the First Barbary War was over.\n\n===Second Barbary War===\n{{main|Second Barbary War}}\n[[File:DecaturOffAlgiers.jpg|right|thumb|''Stephen Decatur's Mediterranean squadron off Algiers in 1815.'']]\nThe Mediterranean Squadron continued to operate until 1807. That year the squadron was withdrawn which tempted the Barbary corsairs to attack American ships again. It was not until the end of the [[War of 1812]] in 1815 that the United States Navy resumed operations against the Barbary coast. Now a commodore, Stephen Decatur led the main squadron of ten vessels including the frigates {{USS|Guerriere|1814|6}}, {{USS|Macedonian|1810|6}}, {{USS|Constellation|1797|6}}, the sloops {{USS|Epervier|1814|6}} and {{USS|Ontario|1813|6}}, the brigs {{USS|Firefly}}, {{USS|Spark|1813|6}}, {{USS|Flambeau|1813|6}} and the schooners {{USS|Torch|1814|6}} and {{USS|Spitfire|1814|6}}. A second force under Commodore [[William Bainbridge]] included the [[ship of the line]] {{USS|Independence|1814|6}}, the frigates {{USS|Congress|1799|6}}, {{USS|Java|1815|6}} and {{USS|United States|1797|6}} with eight smaller vessels but these warships did not see combat. Only two battles were fought during the Second Barbary War. Decatur's squadron [[Battle off Cape Gata|captured]] the [[Algeria]]n flagship ''Mashouda'' of forty-six guns off [[Cape Gata]] on June 15 and later [[Battle off Cape Palos|defeated]] the twenty-two gun ''Estedio'' off [[Cape Palos]] on June 19.

It was formed in response to the [[First Barbary War]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s. Between 1801 and 1818, the squadron was composed of a series of rotating squadrons.  Later, squadrons were sent in the 1820s to the 1860s to suppress [[piracy]], primarily in [[Greece]] and to engage in [[gunboat diplomacy]].<ref name=\"Barbary Corsairs\">{{cite book|isbn=|oclc=|title=Our Navy and the Barbary Corsairs|url=https://archive.org/details/ournavybarbaryco00alle|last=Allen| first=Gardner Weld|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Chester|year=1905}}</ref> In 1865 the force was renamed the [[European Squadron]].\n\n==History==\n\n===First Barbary War===\n{{main|First Barbary War}}\nThe [[Barbary pirates]]' seizure of American merchant ships went back to just after the [[American War of Independence|victory]] over [[Great Britain]] in 1783. When the [[Dey of Algiers]] demanded tribute, the Americans refused and thus began a long series of conflict between the Barbary states and the United States lasting from the 1780s to 1815. The Mediterranean Squadron was created for the protection of American merchant ships sailing in Mediterranean waters.\nThe first squadron sent was under the command of [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Richard Dale]]. His command included the [[frigate]]s {{USS|Boston|1799|6}}, {{USS|Essex|1799|6}}, {{USS|Philadelphia|1799|6}} and {{USS|President|1800|6}} as well as the [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|George Washington|1798|6}} and the [[schooner]] {{USS|Enterprise|1799|6}}. During the squadron's deployment from 1801 to 1802, it operated by convoying merchant ships. Commodore Dale did not have orders to capture enemy vessels and could only respond to the North African's attacks if fired upon first or if coming to the aid of a merchant ship. On August 1, 1801, the twelve gun schooner USS ''Enterprise'' under the command of Lieutenant [[Andrew Sterett]] encountered the fourteen gun [[Tripoli]]tan [[polacca]] named ''Tripoli''. USS ''Enterprise'' captured ''Tripoli'' after a long and bloody [[Action of 1 August 1801|fight]] but because the squadron could not legally make a prize of the ship, it was stripped of its fighting capabilities and released.\n[[File:Burning of the uss philadelphia.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''The burning of USS Philadelphia by the crew of USS Intrepid, 1804.'']]\nAs attacks on merchantmen continued, the United States government eventually authorized the United States Navy to send a second squadron to blockade Tripoli and attack their ships. In May 1802 Captain [[Daniel McNeill]] in USS ''Boston'' assisted two [[Sweden|Swedish]] frigates in a [[First Battle of Tripoli Harbor|battle]] while blockading Tripoli. In the action several Barbary vessels sortied and the Americans and Swedish frigates fought off the attack which then forced the Tripolitans back into harbor. In June 1803, USS ''John Adams'' and USS ''Enterprise'' [[Action of 22 June 1803|defeated]] nine enemy gunboats and a [[polacre]] near Tripoli. The polacre was sunk and the gunboats forced to flee, the Americans suffered no casualties. The second squadron returned to the United States in 1803 and that same year another force was sent and operated until 1804. On October 31, 1803, USS ''Philadelphia'' grounded on a reef just off [[Tripoli Harbor]]. Under heavy fire from enemy [[shore battery|shore batteries]] the Americans attempted to refloat their ship but she was hard aground. When Tripolitan gunboats approached for her capture, her commander surrendered his ship and was made a slave along with the crew. ''Philadelphia'' was then manned by the Tripolitans as a sort of harbor defence until February 16, 1804. On that night Lieutenant [[Stephen Decatur]] in the [[ketch]] {{USS|Intrepid|1798|6}} boarded and [[Second Battle of Tripoli Harbor|recaptured]] ''Philadelphia'' and [[scuttled]] her by fire. This was the most remembered action in the battle for Tripoli. Decatur became famous immediately after this and had a long career of serving the American navy with distinction. He later commanded American forces during the [[Second Barbary War]] in 1815.\n\nAt the final [[Battle of Derne|engagement]] of the war in April and May 1805, the [[brig]] {{USS|Argus|1803|6}}, the schooner {{USS|Nautilus|1799|6}} and the sloop {{USS|Hornet|1805 sloop|6}} provided gun support for ten American marines and soldiers leading a [[mercenary]] army against [[Derna, Libya|Derne]]. During the battle the Mediterranean Squadron vessels under [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] bombarded the city while the land forces besieged the Tripolitan garrison. When the city finally fell, the Dey of Algiers surrendered and the First Barbary War was over.\n\n===Second Barbary War===\n{{main|Second Barbary War}}\n[[File:DecaturOffAlgiers.jpg|right|thumb|''Stephen Decatur's Mediterranean squadron off Algiers in 1815.'']]\nThe Mediterranean Squadron continued to operate until 1807. That year the squadron was withdrawn which tempted the Barbary corsairs to attack American ships again. It was not until the end of the [[War of 1812]] in 1815 that the United States Navy resumed operations against the Barbary coast. Now a commodore, Stephen Decatur led the main squadron of ten vessels including the frigates {{USS|Guerriere|1814|6}}, {{USS|Macedonian|1810|6}}, {{USS|Constellation|1797|6}}, the sloops {{USS|Epervier|1814|6}} and {{USS|Ontario|1813|6}}, the brigs {{USS|Firefly}}, {{USS|Spark|1813|6}}, {{USS|Flambeau|1813|6}} and the schooners {{USS|Torch|1814|6}} and {{USS|Spitfire|1814|6}}. A second force under Commodore [[William Bainbridge]] included the [[ship of the line]] {{USS|Independence|1814|6}}, the frigates {{USS|Congress|1799|6}}, {{USS|Java|1815|6}} and {{USS|United States|1797|6}} with eight smaller vessels but these warships did not see combat. Only two battles were fought during the Second Barbary War. Decatur's squadron [[Battle off Cape Gata|captured]] the [[Algeria]]n flagship ''Mashouda'' of forty-six guns off [[Cape Gata]] on June 15 and later [[Battle off Cape Palos|defeated]] the twenty-two gun ''Estedio'' off [[Cape Palos]] on June 19.

Mr. Arsala is a former [[Vice President of Afghanistan]], Finance Minister and Foreign Minister and until October 2013 was the Senior Minister of the Republic of Afghanistan, appointed by the President [[Hamid Karzai]]. He is an ethnic [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]].\n\n==Education==\nAn ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], Arsala grew up in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan, where he attended high school. He completed his BA and MA in [[Economics]], also focusing on international relations, at [[Southern Illinois University]] (SIU) in the [[United States|United States of America]]. He also completed the course work and qualifying exams for a [[PhD]] in [[Economics]] at [[George Washington University]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] In May 2008, SIU conferred an honorary doctorate on Arsala for his distinguished services to Afghanistan.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1969, Hedayat Amin-Arsala was the first Afghan to join the [[World Bank]] (WB) through the Young Professional Program. He served there for 18 years in several economic and senior operational posts. Active in the resistance against the Soviet occupation since 1979, he left the WB in 1987 to participate full-time in the Afghan struggle.<ref name=\"PBS\">[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] -   ''[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/afghanistan/segment_8-29-89.html Rebels Without A Cause]'', by [[MacNeil]]/[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|Lehrer, NewsHour]]. August 29, 1989</ref> He was a founding member of the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan (NIFA), led by Pir Sayed Ahmad Gailani, and a member of the Supreme Council of [[Mujahideen]] Unity (formed in February 1980). He served as the Finance Minister in the Afghan Interim Government (AIG) in exile from 1989 to 1992.\n\nWhen the Soviets withdrew and there was a subsequent regime change in Afghanistan, Arsala was appointed as the Foreign Minister of the newly formed Mujahideen coalition government in early 1993. He withdrew from that post in 1995 due to infighting and political disagreement amongst some Mujahideen groups.\n\nWith the rise of the Taliban, Arsala- with some compatriots- launched a peace campaign which called for a broad-based interim Government through a [[Loya Jirga]]. This peace movement, later known as \u2018The Rome Group\u2019, and its key members, including Arsala, were key participants in the Bonn deliberations after 11 September 2001. The [[Bonn Conference]] resulted in the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]] and the formation of the Interim Afghan Administration. Mr. Hamid Karzai was appointed Chairman and Mr. Arsala Vice Chairman and the first Minister of Finance in post-Taliban Afghanistan.<ref>PBS - [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]], ''[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/campaign/withus/cbonn.html Filling The Vacuume: The Bonn Conference]''</ref> The Bonn Conference also provided a roadmap for subsequent political developments. In June 2002, the Transitional Government of Afghanistan was formed. The Emergency Loya Jirga of Afghanistan elected Mr. Hamid Karzai as [[President of Afghanistan|President]], and Mr. Arsala was appointed as [[Vice President of Afghanistan]].\n\nAs Vice-President (VP), Arsala simultaneously headed the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission. He also chaired the Economic Coordination Council and the National Census Committee. He was a member of the National Security Council, and at times, in Mr. Karzai's absence, Acting President. After 2.5 years as VP, Arsala was appointed Senior Advisor to the President as well as the Minister for Commerce and Industry. In 2006, he became the Senior Minister of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and in the latter part of 2008, he simultaneously became the Chairman of the Government Coordination Committee (GCC) and served as the Co-Chair of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board.\n\n==Accomplishments==\nAs the first Minister of Finance in the post-Taliban regime, Arsala:\n* Introduced the first Afghan budget and enforced fiscal discipline by stopping the finance of Government expenditure through Central Bank borrowing\n* Initiated the discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on introducing the new Afghan currency. Today, his signature appears on every Afghan banknote\n* Led an increase in Government revenue by 60% above IMF projections\n\nIn early 2002, Arsala also co-chaired the first international Afghanistan aid and development conference in Tokyo. Later in the same year, he led the first international aid conference in Afghanistan.

Mr. Arsala is a former [[Vice President of Afghanistan]], Finance Minister and Foreign Minister and until October 2013 was the Senior Minister of the Republic of Afghanistan, appointed by the President [[Hamid Karzai]]. He is an ethnic [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]].\n\n==Education==\nAn ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], Arsala grew up in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan, where he attended high school. He completed his BA and MA in [[Economics]], also focusing on international relations, at [[Southern Illinois University]] (SIU) in the [[United States|United States of America]]. He also completed the course work and qualifying exams for a [[PhD]] in [[Economics]] at [[George Washington University]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] In May 2008, SIU conferred an honorary doctorate on Arsala for his distinguished services to Afghanistan.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1969, Hedayat Amin-Arsala was the first Afghan to join the [[World Bank]] (WB) through the Young Professional Program. He served there for 18 years in several economic and senior operational posts. Active in the resistance against the Soviet occupation since 1979, he left the WB in 1987 to participate full-time in the Afghan struggle.<ref name=\"PBS\">[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] -   ''[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/afghanistan/segment_8-29-89.html Rebels Without A Cause]'', by [[MacNeil]]/[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|Lehrer, NewsHour]]. August 29, 1989</ref> He was a founding member of the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan (NIFA), led by Pir Sayed Ahmad Gailani, and a member of the Supreme Council of [[Mujahideen]] Unity (formed in February 1980). He served as the Finance Minister in the Afghan Interim Government (AIG) in exile from 1989 to 1992.\n\nWhen the Soviets withdrew and there was a subsequent regime change in Afghanistan, Arsala was appointed as the Foreign Minister of the newly formed Mujahideen coalition government in early 1993. He withdrew from that post in 1995 due to infighting and political disagreement amongst some Mujahideen groups.\n\nWith the rise of the Taliban, Arsala- with some compatriots- launched a peace campaign which called for a broad-based interim Government through a [[Loya Jirga]]. This peace movement, later known as \u2018The Rome Group\u2019, and its key members, including Arsala, were key participants in the Bonn deliberations after 11 September 2001. The [[Bonn Conference]] resulted in the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]] and the formation of the Interim Afghan Administration. Mr. Hamid Karzai was appointed Chairman and Mr. Arsala Vice Chairman and the first Minister of Finance in post-Taliban Afghanistan.<ref>PBS - [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]], ''[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/campaign/withus/cbonn.html Filling The Vacuume: The Bonn Conference]''</ref> The Bonn Conference also provided a roadmap for subsequent political developments. In June 2002, the Transitional Government of Afghanistan was formed. The Emergency Loya Jirga of Afghanistan elected Mr. Hamid Karzai as [[President of Afghanistan|President]], and Mr. Arsala was appointed as [[Vice President of Afghanistan]].\n\nAs Vice-President (VP), Arsala simultaneously headed the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission. He also chaired the Economic Coordination Council and the National Census Committee. He was a member of the National Security Council, and at times, in Mr. Karzai\u2019s absence, Acting President. After 2.5 years as VP, Arsala was appointed Senior Advisor to the President as well as the Minister for Commerce and Industry. In 2006, he became the Senior Minister of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and in the latter part of 2008, he simultaneously became the Chairman of the Government Coordination Committee (GCC) and served as the Co-Chair of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board.\n\n==Accomplishments==\nAs the first Minister of Finance in the post-Taliban regime, Arsala:\n* Introduced the first Afghan budget and enforced fiscal discipline by stopping the finance of Government expenditure through Central Bank borrowing\n* Initiated the discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on introducing the new Afghan currency. Today, his signature appears on every Afghan banknote\n* Led an increase in Government revenue by 60% above IMF projections\n\nIn early 2002, Arsala also co-chaired the first international Afghanistan aid and development conference in Tokyo. Later in the same year, he led the first international aid conference in Afghanistan. He pioneered a number of innovative civil service initiatives aimed at improving the public sector and effective governance within Afghanistan, creating the first Independent Administration Reform and [[Civil Service]] Commission to reform government institutions and introducing a system of civil service appointments and promotion on the basis of merit rather than patronage or nepotism.

His father, [[Albert Alain]] (1880\u20131971) was an organist, composer and organ builder who had studied with [[Alexandre Guilmant]] and [[Louis Vierne]]. His younger brother was the composer, organist and pianist [[Olivier Alain]] (1918\u20131994), and his youngest sister the organist [[Marie-Claire Alain]] (1926\u20132013).<ref name=family>{{cite web |url=https://www.thediapason.com/national-french-centenary-celebration-birth-jehan-alain-1911\u20131940 |title=National French Centenary Celebration of the Birth of Jehan Alain (1911\u20131940) |magazine=[[The Diapason (magazine)|The Diapason]] |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> Jehan received his initial training in the piano from Augustin Pierson, the organist of Saint-Louis at Versailles, and in the organ from his father, who had built a four-manual instrument in the family sitting room.<ref name=Woodstra>Woodstra, Chris et al.

He studied the organ with [[Marcel Dupr\u00e9]], under whose direction he took first prize for Organ and Improvisation in 1939. His studies in composition with [[Paul Dukas]] and [[Jean Roger-Ducasse]] won him the ''Prix des amis de l'orgue'' in 1936 for his ''Suite for Organ, Op. 48: Introduction, Variations, Scherzo and Choral''.<ref name=Woodstra />\n\nHe was appointed organist of Eglise Saint-Nicolas de Maisons-Laffitte in Paris in 1935, and remained there for four years. He also played regularly at the Rue Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth synagogue.<ref name=Woodstra />  The only known recording of his playing\u2014a six-minute improvisation\u2014was made in 1938 at that synagogue.\n\nHis short career as a composer began in 1929, when Alain was 18, and lasted until the outbreak of the Second World War 10 years later. His music was influenced not only by the musical language of the earlier [[Claude Debussy]] and his own contemporary [[Olivier Messiaen]] (seen in ''Le jardin suspendu'', 1934), but also by an interest in the music, dance and philosophies of the far east (acquired at the [[Exposition coloniale internationale]] of 1931 and seen in ''Deux danses \u00e0 Agni Yavishta'', 1932, and ''Deuxi\u00e8me fantaisie'', 1936), a renaissance of baroque music (seen in ''Variations sur un th\u00e8me de Cl\u00e9ment Janequin'', 1937), and in jazz (seen in ''Trois danses'' of 1939). Alain described ''Le jardin suspendu'' (\"The Hanging Garden\") as a portrayal of \"the ideal, perpetual pursuit and escape of the artist, an inaccessible and inviolable refuge\".<ref name=Globe>{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2013/10/05/score-rare-refuge-from-brutality-war/jvDiidYrrLWDzBqPs31DCL/story.html | title=A rare refuge from brutality of war | work=[[Boston Globe]] | date=October 5, 2013 | accessdate=December 14, 2019 | author=Guerrieri, Matthew}}</ref>\n{{Listen|filename=Janequin.ogg|type=music|title=Variations sur un th\u00e8me de Cl\u00e9ment Janequin|description=Variations on a theme of [[Cl\u00e9ment Janequin]], composed in 1937, run time of three minutes and 45 seconds, \"JA 118\", performed by [[Marc Giacone]]}}He wrote choral music, including a [[Requiem mass]], [[chamber music]], songs and three volumes of piano music.

''Deuils'' (\"mourning\"), the second of the ''Trois danses'', is dedicated to Odile (Alain's deceased sister) as a \"Funeral Dance to an Heroic Memory\".<ref name=Woodstra />\n\nAlways interested in mechanics, Alain was a skilled motorcyclist and became a dispatch rider in the Eighth Motorised Armour Division of the French Army. On 20 June 1940, he was assigned to reconnoitre the German advance on the eastern side of [[Battle of Saumur (1940)|Saumur]], and encountered a group of German soldiers at Le Petit-Puy.

Born into a family of musicians, he learned the organ from his father and a host of other teachers, becoming a composer at 18, and composing until the outbreak of the Second World War 10 years later. His music was influenced not only by the musical language of the earlier [[Claude Debussy]] and his contemporary [[Olivier Messiaen]], as well as his interest in music, dance and philosophies of the far east. At the outbreak of WWII Alain became a dispatch rider in the [[8th Infantry Division (France)|Eighth Motorised Armour Division]] of the French Army; he took part in the [[Battle of Saumur (1940)|Battle of Saumur]], in which he was killed.\n\n==Biography==\nAlain was born in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] in the western suburbs of Paris, into a family of musicians. His father, [[Albert Alain]] (1880\u20131971) was an organist, composer and organ builder who had studied with [[Alexandre Guilmant]] and [[Louis Vierne]]. His younger brother was the composer, organist and pianist [[Olivier Alain]] (1918\u20131994), his youngest sister the organist [[Marie-Claire Alain]] (1926\u20132013), his wife Madeleine and his three children Denis, Agn\u00e8s, and Lise.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thediapason.com/national-french-centenary-celebration-birth-jehan-alain-1911\u20131940 |title=National French Centenary Celebration of the Birth of Jehan Alain (1911\u20131940) |magazine=[[The Diapason (magazine)|The Diapason]] |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> Jehan received his initial training in the piano from Augustin Pierson, the organist of Saint-Louis at Versailles, and in the organ from his father, who had built a four-manual instrument in the family sitting room.<ref name=Woodstra>Woodstra, Chris et al.

He studied the organ with [[Marcel Dupr\u00e9]], under whose direction he took first prize for Organ and Improvisation in 1939. His studies in composition with [[Paul Dukas]] and [[Jean Roger-Ducasse]] won him the ''Prix des amis de l'orgue'' in 1936 for his ''Suite for Organ Op. 48, Introduction, Variations, Scherzo and Choral''.<ref name=Woodstra />\n\nHe was appointed organist of Eglise Saint-Nicolas de Maisons-Laffitte in Paris in 1935, and remained there for four years. He also played regularly at the Rue Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth synagogue.<ref name=Woodstra />  The only known recording of his playing\u2014a six-minute improvisation\u2014was made in 1938 at that synagogue.\n\nHis short career as a composer began in 1929, when Alain was 18, and lasted until the outbreak of the Second World War 10 years later. His music was influenced not only by the musical language of the earlier [[Claude Debussy]] and his contemporary [[Olivier Messiaen]] (seen in ''Le jardin suspendu'', 1934), but also by an interest in the music, dance and philosophies of the far east (acquired at the [[Exposition coloniale internationale]] of 1931 and seen in ''Deux danses \u00e0 Agni Yavishta'', 1932, and ''Deuxi\u00e8me fantaisie'', 1936), a renaissance of baroque music (seen in ''Variations sur un th\u00e8me de Cl\u00e9ment Janequin'', 1937), and in jazz (seen in ''Trois danses'' of 1939). Alain described ''Le jardin suspendu'' (\"The Hanging Garden\") as a portrayal of \"the ideal, perpetual pursuit and escape of the artist, an inaccessible and inviolable refuge\".<ref name=Globe>{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2013/10/05/score-rare-refuge-from-brutality-war/jvDiidYrrLWDzBqPs31DCL/story.html | title=A rare refuge from brutality of war | work=[[Boston Globe]] | date=October 5, 2013 | accessdate=December 14, 2019 | author=Guerrieri, Matthew}}</ref>\n{{Listen|filename=Janequin.ogg|type=music|title=Variations sur un th\u00e8me de Cl\u00e9ment Janequin|description=Variations on a theme of [[Cl\u00e9ment Janequin]], composed in 1937, run time of three minutes and 45 seconds, \"JA 118\", performed by [[Marc Giacone]]}}He wrote choral music, including a [[Requiem mass]], [[chamber music]], songs and three volumes of piano music.

''Deuils'' (\"mourning\"), the second of the ''Trois danses'', is dedicated to Odile (Alain's deceased sister) as a \"Funeral Dance to an Heroic Memory\".<ref name=Woodstra />\n\nAlways interested in mechanics, Alain was a skilled motorcyclist and became a dispatch rider in the Eighth Motorised Armour Division of the French Army. On 20 June 1940, he was assigned to reconnoitre the German advance on the eastern side of [[Battle of Saumur (1940)|Saumur]], and encountered a group of German soldiers at Le Petit-Puy.

The report was favorable, so far as the improvement of the river was concerned; but the nine-mile road to the mines was unanimously voted impracticable. \"To give you an idea of the country over which the road is to pass,\" wrote one of the commissioners, \"I need only tell you that I considered it quite an easement when the wheel of my carriage struck a stump instead of a stone.\" The public mind was divided. Some held that the attempt to operate the coal mine was farcical, but that the improvement of the Lehigh River was an undertaking of great value and of probable profit to investors. Others were just as positive that the river improvement would follow the fate of so many similar enterprises but that a fortune was in store for those who invested in the Lehigh mines.\n\nThe direct result of the examiners' report and of the public debate it provoked was the organization of the first interlocking companies in the commercial history of America. The Lehigh Navigation Company was formed with a capital stock of $150,000 and the Lehigh Coal Company with a capital stock of $55,000. This incident forms one of the most striking illustrations in American history of the dependence of a commercial venture upon methods of inland transportation. The Lehigh Navigation Company proceeded to build its dams and walls while the Lehigh Coal Company constructed the first roadway in America built on the principle\u2014later adopted by the railway\u2014of dividing the total distance by the total descent in order to determine the grade. Not to be outdone in point of ingenuity, the Lehigh Navigation Company, then suffering from an unprecedented dearth of water, adopted White's invention of sluice gates connecting with pools which could be filled with reserve water to be drawn upon as navigation required. By 1819 the necessary depth of water between Mauch Chunk and Easton was obtained.

The plan adopted was to contract the channel of the river in the form of a funnel, wherever it was found necessary to raise the water, throwing up the round river-stones into low walls or wing dams, thus providing a regular descending navigation.\n \nBut it soon became apparent that the carrying out of this plan would not insure sufficient water in seasons of drought to float a loaded ark or boat, and the success of the whole enterprise hung in the balance. In this contingency, Josiah White, who was a man of great resourcefulness and mechanical ingenuity, resorted to the expedient of creating artificial freshets.  Dams were constructed in the neighborhood of Mauch Chunk, in which were placed sluice-gates of peculiar design, invented for the purpose by White, and by means of which water could be retained until required for use. When the dam became full and the water had run over it long enough for the river below to regain its ordinary depth, the sluice-gates were let down, while the boats, which were lying in the pool above, passed down with the artificial flood. In this manner the difficulty was overcome.  Crews were sent up [[Pisgah Ridge|Mount Pisgah]] to improve the mule trails down from the coal deposits at [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania]], and others to build docks, boat building facilities, and the canal systems head end pool and locks.|author= Fred Brenckman, The History of Carbon County Pennsylvania}}\n  \nThe canal head end needed a location where barges could be built and timber and coal could be brought into slack water. The challenge was to do it above the gap made by the east end of [[Mount Pisgah, Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Mount Pisgah]], a hard rock knob that towers 900 feet above the Lehigh River towns [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Jim Thorpe]] (formerly Mauch Chunk) to the towns west, and [[Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania|Nesquehoning]] to its north. Both towns are built into the flanks, the [[:wikt:traverse|traverse]]s, of the [[Pisgah Mountain|mountain]], with flats along the river banks. (A few decades later, railroads would follow the canals.) \n \nWithin the next two years, White and Hazard constructed a descending navigation system that used their unique \"bear trap\" or hydrostatic [[Lock (water transport)|locks]], which allowed the passage of coal boats by means of artificial floods. The coal arrived at the head end from the mines at Summit Hill or down along the steep mule trail from near the headwaters of [[Panther Creek (Little Schuylkill River)|Panther Creek]]. It floated down the navigation; at journey's end, the barges were sold as fuel or for Delaware basin transports.\n\nThe navigation company began shipping significant quantities of coal by early 1819, ahead of expectations, and attained their goal of regular shipments in 1820.<ref \n name=HistCC02>\n{{cite book| title=HISTORY OF CARBON COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA | date= 1884| author = Fred Brenckman\n | publisher = J.

With one or two unimportant exceptions, this was the first railroad in the United States.{{efn|Brenckman is ignoring that at least three railroads that would become famous were formally chartered in 1826, including the second chartered and second constructed, the 3 mile [[Granite Railroad]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]].  The SH&MC was not even the second chartered in Pennsylvania, that honor goes to the similar coal road from the summits near [[Carbondale, PA|Carbondale]], the [[Delaware and Hudson Gravity Railroad]] subsidiary of the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]] inspired by the LC&N's success backed by other Philadelphia businessmen and the granite road.}}\nIt was nine miles in length, and occupied the route of the old wagon road most of the distance.\n \nSummit Hill, lying nearly a thousand feet higher than Mauch Chunk, the cars on the road made this descent by gravity, passing the coal, at their destination to the boats in the river by means of inclined planes and chutes. The whole of this plan was evolved by Josiah White, under whose direction it was consummated in a period of about four months. The rails were of rolled bar-iron, three-eighths of an inch in thickness and an inch and a half in width, laid upon wooden ties, which were kept in place by means of stone ballast.\n \nThe loaded cars or wagons, as they were then termed, each having a capacity of approximately one and a half tons, were connected in trains of from six to fourteen, being attended by men who regulated their speed.\n \nTurn-outs were provided at intervals and the empty cars were drawn back to the mines by mules. They descended with the trains in specially constructed cars, affording a novel and rather ludicrous spectacle.{{efn\n  |Elsewhere, Brenckman details that special mule cars carrying the [[animal power]] component of the system were sent down after, or as the trail car of, the coal consists, providing at least part of the spectacle to which he refers. Throughput was kept up by sending 2-3 runs per day at first, then by round-the-clock operations by lantern headlights until demand outstripped the capability of keeping up. By then with the 1846 experience of engineering the [[Ashley Planes]] railways, White devised the [[Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad]]'s return [[cable railroad]]. This changed the return trip time from about four hours to just 20 minutes, allowing more than twelve times the traffic.}}\n \nThirty minutes was the average time consumed in making the descent, while the weary trip back to the mines required three hours.|author= Brenckman|source=History of Carbon County (1894) }}\n \nThe [[wagon road]] to become [[gravity railroad]] ran from what later became [[Summit Hill, PA|Summit Hill]] along the south side of [[Pisgah Ridge]] to [[Mount Pisgah, Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Mount Pisgah]] to the canal's loading chute over {{convert|200|ft}} above the canal banks,{{efn|The lower terminal railyard thus ended in what is today the housing in ''\"Upper Mauch Chunk\"'', ending at Mauch Chunk above the present-day North Avenue.

The need for an injection of new cash to do such repairs in 1821 lead to the company reorganization into the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, which also bought out [[George Hauto]]'s share and left White and Hazard with majority ownership; having injected most additional funding from their own pockets.<ref \n name=BHoCC/> In 1823 the upper four locks on the Lehigh Navigation from Lehigh Gap to Mauch Chunk were rebuilt as proof of concept test beds with a spacious bi-directional long lock system. \nWhite had offered the legislature to build a ship & steam tug capable two way lock canal system from Mauch Chunk down to Philadelphia along the Lehigh and Delaware in 1823, but was rebuffed in 1824, with the promise the state would build the Delaware Canal.

The third line, The Lehigh and New England, connected to other rail links that led to New York. It served the company's Panther Valley coal mines and provided a rail link for the Lehigh Valley's many cement plants. Coupled with the 45,000 acres of property in the Poconos and 700,000 shares of stock in the National Power and Light Co., predecessor of the Pennsylvania Power & Light Co., the LCN seemed invincible.\n}}</ref> which operated both canals into the 1930s.  In mid-1832 White's men had repaired the most egregiously leaking sections well enough to begin operations, and the LC&N Co. spun-off the Lehigh Navigation Coal Company the LNC Co.,  as a subsidiary operating company with its own management.\n\n====Mill Parks====\nFounders White and Hazard were at first, mill and foundry owners acting decisively to secure fuel for their main businesses prior to 1815's application for [[right-of-way]] legislation and optioning the sad-sack LCMC operations.  In 1814, the partners had actually invested first in the rival [[Schuylkill Canal]] where they'd become disgusted with the planning, funding, and lack of commitment by other board members&mdash;their concerns take on added weight given the Schuylkill didn't operate until 1823 when LC&N had blazed the way.  White's innovative Bear Trap lock-gate and system was based on creating a triggerable artificial flood, depending upon water flow to float the boats past the rapids obstructions. It is little wonder that as he surveyed the Lehigh, he also made note where a water powered mill could be harnessed, and the legislative act would effectively give the LNC ownership of the entire river. These rights were not released back to Pennsylvania until 1964.{{efn|Check 1964 date in ''The Delaware and Lehigh Canals''}} \n \nSo once 'emergency' improvements on the canal{{efn\n  |Lower Canal completed initially in late 1820, there were several places experience in 1821 showed a need for re-engineering. In the Winter of 1821-8122, the system was severely damaged for the first time, taking the LCN's total cash reserves to repair. This situation resulted in directors White and Hazard seeking additional capital funds leading to the dissolution of the LCC and LNC and the ''incorporation of the '''Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company'''''.\n  }} used its founder's knowledge and experience on the [[Little Schuylkill]] to develop the waterpower sites along its waterways into early industrial parks. By 1840, the Abbott Street area near Lock 47, now part of Easton's [[National Canal Museum|Hugh Moore Park]], employed over 1,000 men in almost a dozen factories. This fostered the industries of Allentown, Bethlehem, and their products and the connection with the [[Delaware Canal]] (managed for the state by LC&N after 1834)<ref, the development of the [[Industrial Revolution]] of greater Philadelphia.\n\n{{expand section|date=September 2016}}\n\n====Blast Furnaces====\nIn TBDL directors White and Hazard brought in Welsh technical experts to establish the Lehigh Valleys first Blast Furnaces. \n{{expand section|date=September 2016}}\n\n====Wire Rope Manufactury====\nIn TBDL, probably as part of the [[Ashley Planes]] [[cable railroad]] work up and spurred by the developing need to mine down shafts as surface deposits were exhausted, Josiah White and the LC&N created the nation's first Wire rope factory in Mauch Chunk.\n\n====Upper Lehigh Canal====\nWith rights of [[eminent domain]] granted by the 1837 revisions to the [[Main Line of Public Works]] legislation, the {{convert|45|mi|km}} [[Lehigh Canal|Lower Lehigh Navigation]] was extended upriver another {{convert|39|mi|km|0}} (the Upper Lehigh Canal) through the [[Lehigh Gorge]] from Jim Thorpe to White Haven and completed in 1843, giving it the largest carrying capacity of any U.S. canal.\n\n====Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad====\n{{main|Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad}}\nWith a unified legislative and executive push, LC&N spun off a subsidiary to build a railroad connection to the Susquehanna at [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]] just north of Wilkes-Barre over very rough terrain. The multi-modal project used a cable railroad called the [[Ashley Planes]], and double-tracked connecting trackage from its foot at Ashley to the barge docks of Pittston and eventually linked up with the seven first-class railroads that drove spurs into the valley to haul anthracite. The Ashley Planes summit end connected to an assembly yard at [[Mountain Top, Pennsylvania]], and sourced a steep double-tracked rail branch to [[White Haven, Pennsylvania|White Haven]] where it had loading docks with a meeting of transport technologies feeding a new extension of its Lehigh Canal through the difficult terrain of the [[Lehigh Gorge]]. With the political push to connect Philadelphia and the Delaware to the Northern Coal Fields in the Wyoming Valley and to the Susquehanna River, LC&N formed the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad empowered with rights of [[eminent domain]]. Eventually, both the LC&N Company's [[Lehigh Canal|Lehigh Navigation]] and the L&SRR were extended upriver through the [[Lehigh Gorge]] from [[Jim Thorpe]] to White Haven.\n\n====Other LC&N railroads====\n{{expand section|To be returned to and finished someday soon later|date=March 2016}} \nBy the later 1820s through the mid-1830s, the civic and business leaders of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and southern New Jersey were anxious to connect their young factories with the markets of the trans-Appalachian territories being settled by tens of thousands of westward migrants. To compete with the B&O Railroad and Erie Canal, they launched the ''[[Main Line of Public Works]]'' to benefit the manufacturers of the Delaware region.\n\nThe LC&N built a succession of small but influential shortline railways as joint ventures with other investors, each of which concurrently solved an earlier irrealizable and intractable civil construction project. Ownership and operations of all these, as well as their initial railway, the [[Mauch Chunk & Summit Hill Railway]], were ultimately combined under the umbrella of their second, the ''Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad'' (Today, this is a holding company that owns and leases the trackage rights to more visible operating road companies for many important rail corridors in northeast Pennsylvania.)\n;Subsidiary shortlines\n* [[Nesquehoning & Mahanoy Railroad]]: Having gained civil engineering experience running a freight line through most of the length of the Lehigh River and across the Delaware, the LC&N chafed at the transport bottleneck of the Panther Creek Valley. With the increasing power of locomotives, the company surveyed and pushed a seven-mile grade up through the winding slopes north of the Nesquehoning Ridge, with several descents, connecting near Hazelton, and the wider valleys of Mahanoy Creek, including that at [[Tamaqua, Pennsylvania]], along the [[Little Schuylkill River]] near the outlet of Panther Creek. From Tamaqua, tracks also reached along the Schuylkill Valley to feed the industries of [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], and surrounds. \n* [[Panther Creek Railroad]]: Having reached Tamaqua, the company built the PCR to reach the main coal-bearing lands 5 to 6 miles to the east up the Panther Creek Valley.\n* [[Hauto Tunnel]]: Shipping large heavy coal consists over the steep gradients of the Nesquehoning shortline was costly, so eventually the company cut a mile-long tunnel through [[Nesquehoning Ridge]] into downtown [[Lansford, Pennsylvania]], which became for a time the seat of its corporate headquarters. This gave the company three means of bringing coal from its mines along Pisgah Ridge and Nesquehoning Mountain until it sold the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway]], which was operating mostly as a prime tourist attraction: the world's first [[roller coaster]].\n\n====Lehigh and New England Railroad====\nThe acquisition of the [[Lehigh and New England]]<ref name=\"Fading\"/> allowed the LC&N to stop leasing rights to the CNJ and transfer them instead to the new acquisition.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Decline===\nIn 1932, the Lehigh Navigation was closed after maintenance expenses surpassed operating revenues.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, the LC&N \u2014 once a widely diversified company \u2014 had become largely dependent on coal revenues, while subsidiaries owned the railroads and other more-profitable arms. The softening of demand for coal, as railroads replaced steam locomotives with diesels and other forms of heating came into wider use, cut deeply into corporate profits. Consequently, various boards oversaw gradual contraction of the company and sales of bits and pieces. In 1966, Greenwood Stripping Co. bought the remaining coal properties, most located as originally exploited along the [[Panther Creek Valley]], and sold them eight years later to Bethlehem Mines Corp.\n \nIn 1986, shareholders dissolved the company after it sold its last business, Cella's Chocolate Covered Cherries, to Tootsie Roll.<ref\n name=\"Fading\">http://articles.mcall.com/1986-06-08/news/2521866_1_parton-coal-industry-lehigh-coal</ref>\n\n=== The new company ===\nThe company name remained associated with anthracite mining through the independently founded and otherwise unrelated [[Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company]], incorporated in 1988. While unrelated legally, the'' 'New Company' '' as it's known in the area was spearheaded by a previous officer and stockholder: James J. Curran Jr. took over Lehigh Coal from Bethlehem Mines Corp. in 1989, and through the 1990s it remained the largest producer of U.S. anthracite, which is now a specialty product. In 2000, Lehigh Coal shut down and laid-off 163 employees, saying plunging coal prices made it impossible to make a profit.

The report was favorable, so far as the improvement of the river was concerned; but the nine-mile road to the mines was unanimously voted impracticable. \"To give you an idea of the country over which the road is to pass,\" wrote one of the commissioners, \"I need only tell you that I considered it quite an easement when the wheel of my carriage struck a stump instead of a stone.\" The public mind was divided. Some held that the attempt to operate the coal mine was farcical, but that the improvement of the Lehigh River was an undertaking of great value and of probable profit to investors. Others were just as positive that the river improvement would follow the fate of so many similar enterprises but that a fortune was in store for those who invested in the Lehigh mines.\n\nThe direct result of the examiners' report and of the public debate it provoked was the organization of the first interlocking companies in the commercial history of America. The Lehigh Navigation Company was formed with a capital stock of $150,000 and the Lehigh Coal Company with a capital stock of $55,000. This incident forms one of the most striking illustrations in American history of the dependence of a commercial venture upon methods of inland transportation. The Lehigh Navigation Company proceeded to build its dams and walls while the Lehigh Coal Company constructed the first roadway in America built on the principle\u2014later adopted by the railway\u2014of dividing the total distance by the total descent in order to determine the grade. Not to be outdone in point of ingenuity, the Lehigh Navigation Company, then suffering from an unprecedented dearth of water, adopted White's invention of sluice gates connecting with pools which could be filled with reserve water to be drawn upon as navigation required. By 1819 the necessary depth of water between Mauch Chunk and Easton was obtained.

The plan adopted was to contract the channel of the river in the form of a funnel, wherever it was found necessary to raise the water, throwing up the round river-stones into low walls or wing dams, thus providing a regular descending navigation.\n \nBut it soon became apparent that the carrying out of this plan would not insure sufficient water in seasons of drought to float a loaded ark or boat, and the success of the whole enterprise hung in the balance. In this contingency, Josiah White, who was a man of great resourcefulness and mechanical ingenuity, resorted to the expedient of creating artificial freshets.  Dams were constructed in the neighborhood of Mauch Chunk, in which were placed sluice-gates of peculiar design, invented for the purpose by White, and by means of which water could be retained until required for use. When the dam became full and the water had run over it long enough for the river below to regain its ordinary depth, the sluice-gates were let down, while the boats, which were lying in the pool above, passed down with the artificial flood. In this manner the difficulty was overcome.  Crews were sent up [[Pisgah Ridge|Mount Pisgah]] to improve the mule trails down from the coal deposits at [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania]], and others to build docks, boat building facilities, and the canal systems head end pool and locks.|author= Fred Brenckman, The History of Carbon County Pennsylvania}}\n  \nThe canal head end needed a location where barges could be built and timber and coal could be brought into slack water. The challenge was to do it above the gap made by the east end of [[Mount Pisgah, Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Mount Pisgah]], a hard rock knob that towers 900 feet above the Lehigh River towns [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Jim Thorpe]] (formerly Mauch Chunk) to the towns west, and [[Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania|Nesquehoning]] to its north. Both towns are built into the flanks, the [[:wikt:traverse|traverse]]s, of the [[Pisgah Mountain|mountain]], with flats along the river banks. (A few decades later, railroads would follow the canals.) \n \nWithin the next two years, White and Hazard constructed a descending navigation system that used their unique \"bear trap\" or hydrostatic [[Lock (water transport)|locks]], which allowed the passage of coal boats by means of artificial floods. The coal arrived at the head end from the mines at Summit Hill or down along the steep mule trail from near the headwaters of [[Panther Creek (Little Schuylkill River)|Panther Creek]]. It floated down the navigation; at journey's end, the barges were sold as fuel or for Delaware basin transports.\n\nThe navigation company began shipping significant quantities of coal by early 1819, ahead of expectations, and attained their goal of regular shipments in 1820.<ref \n name=HistCC02>\n{{cite book| title=HISTORY OF CARBON COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA | date= 1884| author = Fred Brenckman\n | publisher = J.

With one or two unimportant exceptions, this was the first railroad in the United States.{{efn|Brenckman is ignoring that at least three railroads that would become famous were formally chartered in 1826, including the second chartered and second constructed, the 3 mile [[Granite Railroad]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]].  The SH&MC was not even the second chartered in Pennsylvania, that honor goes to the similar coal road from the summits near [[Carbondale, PA|Carbondale]], the [[Delaware and Hudson Gravity Railroad]] subsidiary of the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]] inspired by the LC&N's success backed by other Philadelphia businessmen and the granite road.}}\nIt was nine miles in length, and occupied the route of the old wagon road most of the distance.\n \nSummit Hill, lying nearly a thousand feet higher than Mauch Chunk, the cars on the road made this descent by gravity, passing the coal, at their destination to the boats in the river by means of inclined planes and chutes. The whole of this plan was evolved by Josiah White, under whose direction it was consummated in a period of about four months. The rails were of rolled bar-iron, three-eighths of an inch in thickness and an inch and a half in width, laid upon wooden ties, which were kept in place by means of stone ballast.\n \nThe loaded cars or wagons, as they were then termed, each having a capacity of approximately one and a half tons, were connected in trains of from six to fourteen, being attended by men who regulated their speed.\n \nTurn-outs were provided at intervals and the empty cars were drawn back to the mines by mules. They descended with the trains in specially constructed cars, affording a novel and rather ludicrous spectacle.{{efn\n  |Elsewhere, Brenckman details that special mule cars carrying the [[animal power]] component of the system were sent down after, or as the trail car of, the coal consists, providing at least part of the spectacle to which he refers. Throughput was kept up by sending 2-3 runs per day at first, then by round-the-clock operations by lantern headlights until demand outstripped the capability of keeping up. By then with the 1846 experience of engineering the [[Ashley Planes]] railways, White devised the [[Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad]]'s return [[cable railroad]]. This changed the return trip time from about four hours to just 20 minutes, allowing more than twelve times the traffic.}}\n \nThirty minutes was the average time consumed in making the descent, while the weary trip back to the mines required three hours.|author= Brenckman|source=History of Carbon County (1894) }}\n \nThe [[wagon road]] to become [[gravity railroad]] ran from what later became [[Summit Hill, PA|Summit Hill]] along the south side of [[Pisgah Ridge]] to [[Mount Pisgah, Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Mount Pisgah]] to the canal's loading chute over {{convert|200|ft}} above the canal banks,{{efn|The lower terminal railyard thus ended in what is today the housing in ''\"Upper Mauch Chunk\"'', ending at Mauch Chunk above the present-day North Avenue.

The need for an injection of new cash to do such repairs in 1821 lead to the company reorganization into the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, which also bought out [[George Hauto]]'s share and left White and Hazard with majority ownership; having injected most additional funding from their own pockets.<ref \n name=BHoCC/> In 1823 the upper four locks on the Lehigh Navigation from Lehigh Gap to Mauch Chunk were rebuilt as proof of concept test beds with a spacious bi-directional long lock system. \nWhite had offered the legislature to build a ship & steam tug capable two way lock canal system from Mauch Chunk down to Philadelphia along the Lehigh and Delaware in 1823, but was rebuffed in 1824, with the promise the state would build the Delaware Canal.

It served the company's Panther Valley coal mines and provided a rail link for the Lehigh Valley's many cement plants.

In mid-1832 White's men had repaired the most egregiously leaking sections well enough to begin operations, and the LC&N Co. spun-off the Lehigh Navigation Coal Company the LNC Co.,  as a subsidiary operating company with its own management.\n\n====Mill Parks====\nFounders White and Hazard were at first, mill and foundry owners acting decisively to secure fuel for their main businesses prior to 1815's application for [[right-of-way]] legislation and optioning the sad-sack LCMC operations.  In 1814, the partners had actually invested first in the rival [[Schuylkill Canal]] where they'd become disgusted with the planning, funding, and lack of commitment by other board members&mdash;their concerns take on added weight given the Schuylkill didn't operate until 1823 when LC&N had blazed the way.  White's innovative Bear Trap lock-gate and system was based on creating a triggerable artificial flood, depending upon water flow to float the boats past the rapids obstructions. It is little wonder that as he surveyed the Lehigh, he also made note where a water powered mill could be harnessed, and the legislative act would effectively give the LNC ownership of the entire river. These rights were not released back to Pennsylvania until 1964.{{efn|Check 1964 date in ''The Delaware and Lehigh Canals''}} \n \nSo once 'emergency' improvements on the canal{{efn\n  |Lower Canal completed initially in late 1820, there were several places experience in 1821 showed a need for re-engineering. In the Winter of 1821-8122, the system was severely damaged for the first time, taking the LCN's total cash reserves to repair. This situation resulted in directors White and Hazard seeking additional capital funds leading to the dissolution of the LCC and LNC and the ''incorporation of the '''Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company'''''.\n  }} used its founder's knowledge and experience on the [[Little Schuylkill]] to develop the waterpower sites along its waterways into early industrial parks. By 1840, the Abbott Street area near Lock 47, now part of Easton's [[National Canal Museum|Hugh Moore Park]], employed over 1,000 men in almost a dozen factories. This fostered the industries of Allentown, Bethlehem, and their products and the connection with the [[Delaware Canal]] (managed for the state by LC&N after 1834)<ref, the development of the [[Industrial Revolution]] of greater Philadelphia.\n\n{{expand section|date=September 2016}}\n\n====Blast Furnaces====\nIn TBDL directors White and Hazard brought in Welsh technical experts to establish the Lehigh Valleys first Blast Furnaces. \n{{expand section|date=September 2016}}\n\n====Wire Rope Manufactury====\nIn TBDL, probably as part of the [[Ashley Planes]] [[cable railroad]] work up and spurred by the developing need to mine down shafts as surface deposits were exhausted, Josiah White and the LC&N created the nation's first Wire rope factory in Mauch Chunk.\n\n====Upper Lehigh Canal====\nWith rights of [[eminent domain]] granted by the 1837 revisions to the [[Main Line of Public Works]] legislation, the {{convert|45|mi|km}} [[Lehigh Canal|Lower Lehigh Navigation]] was extended upriver another {{convert|39|mi|km|0}} (the Upper Lehigh Canal) through the [[Lehigh Gorge]] from Jim Thorpe to White Haven and completed in 1843, giving it the largest carrying capacity of any U.S. canal.\n\n====Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad====\n{{main|Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad}}\nWith a unified legislative and executive push, LC&N spun off a subsidiary to build a railroad connection to the Susquehanna at [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]] just north of Wilkes-Barre over very rough terrain. The multi-modal project used a cable railroad called the [[Ashley Planes]], and double-tracked connecting trackage from its foot at Ashley to the barge docks of Pittston and eventually linked up with the seven first-class railroads that drove spurs into the valley to haul anthracite. The Ashley Planes summit end connected to an assembly yard at [[Mountain Top, Pennsylvania]], and sourced a steep double-tracked rail branch to [[White Haven, Pennsylvania|White Haven]] where it had loading docks with a meeting of transport technologies feeding a new extension of its Lehigh Canal through the difficult terrain of the [[Lehigh Gorge]]. With the political push to connect Philadelphia and the Delaware to the Northern Coal Fields in the Wyoming Valley and to the Susquehanna River, LC&N formed the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad empowered with rights of [[eminent domain]]. Eventually, both the LC&N Company's [[Lehigh Canal|Lehigh Navigation]] and the L&SRR were extended upriver through the [[Lehigh Gorge]] from [[Jim Thorpe]] to White Haven.\n\n====Other LC&N railroads====\n{{expand section|To be returned to and finished someday soon later|date=March 2016}} \nBy the later 1820s through the mid-1830s, the civic and business leaders of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and southern New Jersey were anxious to connect their young factories with the markets of the trans-Appalachian territories being settled by tens of thousands of westward migrants. To compete with the B&O Railroad and Erie Canal, they launched the ''[[Main Line of Public Works]]'' to benefit the manufacturers of the Delaware region.\n\nThe LC&N built a succession of small but influential shortline railways as joint ventures with other investors, each of which concurrently solved an earlier irrealizable and intractable civil construction project. Ownership and operations of all these, as well as their initial railway, the [[Mauch Chunk & Summit Hill Railway]], were ultimately combined under the umbrella of their second, the ''Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad'' (Today, this is a holding company that owns and leases the trackage rights to more visible operating road companies for many important rail corridors in northeast Pennsylvania.)\n;Subsidiary shortlines\n* [[Nesquehoning & Mahanoy Railroad]]: Having gained civil engineering experience running a freight line through most of the length of the Lehigh River and across the Delaware, the LC&N chafed at the transport bottleneck of the Panther Creek Valley. With the increasing power of locomotives, the company surveyed and pushed a seven-mile grade up through the winding slopes north of the Nesquehoning Ridge, with several descents, connecting near Hazelton, and the wider valleys of Mahanoy Creek, including that at [[Tamaqua, Pennsylvania]], along the [[Little Schuylkill River]] near the outlet of Panther Creek. From Tamaqua, tracks also reached along the Schuylkill Valley to feed the industries of [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], and surrounds. \n* [[Panther Creek Railroad]]: Having reached Tamaqua, the company built the PCR to reach the main coal-bearing lands 5 to 6 miles to the east up the Panther Creek Valley.\n* [[Hauto Tunnel]]: Shipping large heavy coal consists over the steep gradients of the Nesquehoning shortline was costly, so eventually the company cut a mile-long tunnel through [[Nesquehoning Ridge]] into downtown [[Lansford, Pennsylvania]], which became for a time the seat of its corporate headquarters. This gave the company three means of bringing coal from its mines along Pisgah Ridge and Nesquehoning Mountain until it sold the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway]], which was operating mostly as a prime tourist attraction: the world's first [[roller coaster]].\n\n====Lehigh and New England Railroad====\nThe acquisition of the [[Lehigh and New England]]<ref name=\"Fading\"/> allowed the LC&N to stop leasing rights to the CNJ and transfer them instead to the new acquisition.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Decline===\nIn 1932, the Lehigh Navigation was closed after maintenance expenses surpassed operating revenues.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, the LC&N \u2014 once a widely diversified company \u2014 had become largely dependent on coal revenues, while subsidiaries owned the railroads and other more-profitable arms. The softening of demand for coal, as railroads replaced steam locomotives with diesels and other forms of heating came into wider use, cut deeply into corporate profits. Consequently, various boards oversaw gradual contraction of the company and sales of bits and pieces. In 1966, Greenwood Stripping Co. bought the remaining coal properties, most located as originally exploited along the [[Panther Creek Valley]], and sold them eight years later to Bethlehem Mines Corp.\n \nIn 1986, shareholders dissolved the company after it sold its last business, Cella's Chocolate Covered Cherries, to Tootsie Roll.<ref\n name=\"Fading\">http://articles.mcall.com/1986-06-08/news/2521866_1_parton-coal-industry-lehigh-coal</ref>\n\n=== The new company ===\nThe company name remained associated with anthracite mining through the independently founded and otherwise unrelated [[Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company]], incorporated in 1988.

Curran Jr. took over Lehigh Coal from Bethlehem Mines Corp. in 1989, and through the 1990s it remained the largest producer of U.S. anthracite, which is now a specialty product. In 2000, Lehigh Coal shut down and laid-off 163 employees, saying plunging coal prices made it impossible to make a profit.
