These works explored [[chronology]], [[alchemy]], and [[Biblical hermeneutics|Biblical interpretation]] (especially of the [[Apocalypse]]). Newton's scientific work may have been of lesser personal importance to him, as he placed emphasis on rediscovering the occult wisdom of the ancients. In this sense, some historians, including economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], believe that any reference to a \"Newtonian Worldview\" as being purely mechanical in nature is somewhat inaccurate.<ref>Keynes, J.M., 'Newton, The Man'; Proceedings of the Royal Society Newton Tercentenary Celebrations, 15\u201319 July 1946; Cambridge University Press (1947)</ref> Historical research on Newton's occult studies in relation to his science have also been used to challenge the [[disenchantment]] narrative within [[critical theory]].<ref>{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | pages = 43 and Chapter 2, ''passim'' |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref>\n\nAfter purchasing and studying Newton's alchemical works, Keynes, for example, opined in 1942 at the [[tercentenary]] of his birth that \"Newton was not the first of the [[age of reason]], he was the last of the [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]].\" In the [[Early Modern Period]] of Newton's lifetime, the educated embraced a [[world view]] different from that of later centuries. Distinctions between science, [[superstition]], and [[pseudoscience]] were still being formulated, and a devoutly Christian biblical perspective permeated Western culture.\n\n==Alchemical research==\nMuch of what are known as Isaac Newton's [[occult]] studies can largely be attributed to his study of [[alchemy]].<ref>\"Newton's manuscripts provide evidence that he gave considerable thought to alchemy as emblematic of a purely scientific explanation of nature and was in fact deeply involved in conceiving alchemy as spiritual.\" F. Calian, \"Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy\" in ''Annual of Medieval Studies'' at CEU (2010), 186.</ref> From a young age, Newton was deeply interested in all forms of [[natural sciences]] and [[materials science]], an interest which would ultimately lead to some of his better-known contributions to science. His earliest encounters with certain alchemical theories and practices were during his childhood, when a twelve year old Isaac Newton was boarding in the attic of an apothecaries shop.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Isaac the Alchemist: Secrets of Isaac Newton|last=Losure|first=Mary|publisher=Candlewick Press|year=2017|isbn=9780763670634|location=Somerville, MA|pages=}}</ref> During Newton's lifetime, the study of [[chemistry]] was still in its infancy, so many of his experimental studies used esoteric language and vague terminology more typically associated with alchemy and occultism.<ref>\"his alchemy cannot be seen solely in connection with his chemical experiments but was also a link between his religious beliefs and his scientific aims\". Karin Figala, \"Newton's Alchemy,\" in The Cambridge Companion to Newton, ed. I. Bernard Cohen and George Edwin Smith (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 375.</ref> It was not until several decades after Newton's death that experiments of [[stoichiometry]] under the pioneering works of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] were conducted, and analytical chemistry, with its associated nomenclature, came to resemble modern chemistry as we know it today. However, Newton's contemporary and fellow Royal Society member, [[Robert Boyle]], had already discovered the basic concepts of modern chemistry and began establishing modern norms of experimental practice and communication in chemistry, information which Newton did not use.\n\nMuch of Newton's writing on alchemy may have been lost in a fire in his laboratory, so the true extent of his work in this area may have been larger than is currently known. Newton also suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during his period of alchemical work, possibly due to some form of chemical poisoning (perhaps from [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], lead, or some other substance).<ref name=\"Nova\" />\n\n[[File:Isaac Newton laboratory fire.jpg|thumb|left|An 1874 engraving showing a probably apocryphal account of Newton's lab fire.

[[English crown|The English Crown]], also fearing the potential devaluation of gold because of the creation of fake gold, made penalties for alchemy very severe. In some cases the punishment for unsanctioned alchemy would include the public hanging of an offender on a gilded scaffold while adorned with tinsel and other unspecified items.<ref name=\"Nova\" />\n\nHe needed to be discreet about alchemy since: alchemy was a vector of heretical ideas and mobs were lynching heretics; alchemy provided technical knowledge about counterfeiting money. So, alchemy was considered dangerous.<ref>''Newton: The Dark Heretic'', BBC, 2003.</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, the question of the nature and degree of influence of alchemy on Newton\u2019s main works, \u201c[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]\u201d and \u201cOptics\u201d has been actively discussed. At present, the understanding that there is a connection between the alchemical and natural science views of Newton has become generally accepted. Some historians of science express an opinion on the decisive nature of the influence of alchemy, occultism and hermetism on the theory of forces and gravity. A discussion of Newton's alchemical studies had a significant impact on the understanding of the [[scientific revolution]].\n\n==Writings==\nDue to the threat of punishment and the potential scrutiny he feared from his peers within the scientific community, Newton may have deliberately left his work on alchemical subjects unpublished. Newton was well known as being highly sensitive to criticism, such as the numerous instances when he was criticized by [[Robert Hooke]], and his admitted reluctance to publish any substantial information regarding [[calculus]] before 1693. A perfectionist by nature, Newton also refrained from publication of material that he felt was incomplete, as evident from a 38-year gap from Newton's conception of calculus in 1666 and its final full publication in 1704, which would ultimately lead to the infamous [[Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy]].\n\nMost of the scientist\u2019s manuscript heritage after his death passed to [[John Conduitt]], the husband of his niece [[Catherine Barton|Catherine]]{{#tag:ref|For more information on Newton\u2019s archive, see {{sfn|Iliffe|1998|pp=137\u2014158}}.}}. To evaluate the manuscripts, physician Thomas Pellet was involved, who decided that only \u201c[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended|the Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms]]\u201d, an unreleased fragment of \u201c[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]\u201d, \"Obsevations upon the Prophesies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John\" and \"Paradoxical Questions Concerning the Morals and Actions of Athanasius and His Followers\" were suitable for publication. The remaining manuscripts, according to Pellet, were \"foul draughts of the Prophetic stile\" and were not suitable for publication. After the death of J. Conduitt in 1737, manuscripts were transferred to Catherine, who unsuccessfully tried to publish theological notes of her uncle. She consulted with Newton's friend, the theologian [[Arthur Ashley Sykes]] (1684\u20141756). Sykes kept 11 manuscripts for himself, and the rest of the archive passed into the family of Catherine's daughter, who married the [[John Wallop, Viscount Lymington]], and was then owned by the [[Earl of Portsmouth|Earls of Portsmouth]]. Sykes' documents after his death came to the Rev. [[Jeffery Ekins]] (d. 1791) and were kept in the family of the latter until they were presented to the [[New College, Oxford]] in 1872{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432|1999|pp=7\u20148}}. Until the mid-19th century, few had access to the Portsmouth collection, including David Brewster, a renowned physicist and biographer of Newton. In 1872, the fifth Earl of Portsmouth transferred part of the manuscripts (mainly of a physical and mathematical nature) to [[Cambridge University]].\n\nIn 1936, a collection of Isaac Newton's unpublished works were auctioned by [[Sotheby's]] on behalf of [[Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth]]. Known as the \"Portsmouth Papers\", this material consisted of 329 lots of Newton's manuscripts, over a third of which were filled with content that appeared to be alchemical in nature. At the time of Newton's death this material was considered \"unfit to publish\" by Newton's estate, and consequently fell into obscurity until their somewhat sensational reemergence in 1936.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Newman\n |first       = William R.\n |title       = Newton and Alchemy\n |publisher   = The Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project\n |date        = 5 April 2007\n |url         = http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/about.do\n |accessdate  = 12 August 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807181322/http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/about.do\n |archivedate = 7 August 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nAt the auction many of these documents, along with Newton's [[death mask]], were purchased by economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who throughout his life collected many of Newton's alchemical writings.<ref name=\"Gleick2004\">{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|authorlink=James Gleick|title=Isaac Newton|url={{Google books|t2-KDQAAQBAJ|page=188|plainurl=yes}}|year=2004|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3295-2|page=188}}</ref> Much of the Keynes collection later passed to eccentric document collector [[Abraham Yahuda]], who was himself a vigorous collector of Isaac Newton's original manuscripts.\n\nMany of the documents collected by Keynes and Yahuda are now in the [[Jewish National and University Library]] in Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|reason=Newton Project says King's College|date=December 2016}} In recent years, several projects have begun to gather, catalogue, and transcribe the fragmented collection of Newton's work on alchemical subjects and make them freely available for on-line access.

Most notably are documents entitled ''Artephius his secret Book'', followed by ''The Epistle of Iohn Pontanus, wherein he beareth witness of ye book of Artephius''; these are themselves a collection of excerpts from another work entitled ''Nicholas Flammel, His Exposition of the Hieroglyphicall Figures'' which he caused to be painted upon an Arch in St Innocents Church-yard in Paris. Together with ''The secret Booke of Artephius, And the Epistle of Iohn Pontanus: Containing both the Theoricke and the Practicke of the Philosophers Stone''. This work may also have been referenced by Newton in its Latin version found within [[Lazarus Zetzner]]'s ''[[Theatrum Chemicum]]'', a volume often associated with the ''[[Turba Philosophorum]]'' and other early European alchemical manuscripts. [[Nicolas Flamel]], one subject of the aforementioned work, was a notable, though mysterious figure, often associated with the discovery of the philosopher's stone, hieroglyphical figures, early forms of [[tarot]], and occultism. [[Artephius]], and his \"secret book\", were also subjects of interest to 17th-century alchemists.\n\nAlso in the 1936 auction of Newton's collection was ''The Epitome of the treasure of health written by Edwardus Generosus Anglicus innominatus who lived Anno Domini 1562''. This is a twenty-eight-page treatise on the philosopher's stone, the Animal or [[Angelicall Stone]], the Prospective stone or magical stone of Moses, and the vegetable or the growing stone.  The treatise concludes with an alchemical poem.\n\n===== The Principia =====\nMany of the discoveries and mathematical formula found within Newton's ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' can be linked, often very directly, to his occult and alchemical studies.  Much of his research into the movement of heavenly bodies was influenced by his belief that there are invisible, occult forces at work in the orbits of celestial bodies. Other natural philosophers, most notably Descartes, tended to object to this notion and insisted instead that action depended on physical contact, proposing that celestial objects were moved about by a great many small particles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Newton: The Making of a Genius|last=Fara|first=Patricia|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780231128063|location=New York|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/newtonmakingofge00fara}}</ref>\n\nThe second book of the Principia has not withstood the test of time.\u00a0Much of the work within this volume revolved around measuring air resistance on the motion of pendulums and spheres.\u00a0 Some believe that the main corpus of this work was ultimately an effort to refute Descartes\u2019s Cartesian theory of Vortices, according to which, planetary motion was produced by whirling fluid vortices that filled interplanetary space. This motion supposedly carried the planets with them.\u00a0 As a spiritual man, and as an alchemist, Newton was determined that the motion of heavenly bodies was motivated by invisible forces, that natural phenomena were motivated by forces spiritual, not merely physical.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton|last=Westfall|first=R.S.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980|isbn=978-0521274357|location=UK|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/neveratrestbiogr00west}}</ref>\n\n===== \"The Key\" a.k.a ''Newton's Clavis'' =====\nA fragmentary alchemical text which, in 1975, became \"generally accepted as\" to be penned by Newton.  Its authorship was immediately questioned by Karin Figala, and in 1988 William Newman conclusively proved it to be a composition by George Starkey; this fact has been repeated in a dozen publications since, and no scholar now thinks the \"Key\" is Newton's.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=P.H.|date=2005|title=The Alchemy Reader: From Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton|url=|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|volume=Vol.38(iss.138).|pages=|via=ProQuest Database}}</ref>\n\n===== Other works =====\nWilliam Newman, a leading scholar of the history of science, has collected many of Newton's alchemical writings.\n\nNewton's various surviving alchemical notebooks clearly show that he made no distinctions between alchemy and what we today consider science. The very same pages in which we find the recordings of his legendary optics experiments we also find various recipes culled from arcane sources. \"Alongside sober explanations of optical and physical phenomena such as freezing and boiling,\" Newman says, \"we find 'Neptune's Trident', 'Mercury's Caducean Rod' and the 'Green Lion', all symbolising alchemical substances.\"\n\nDetermining that many of Newton's acclaimed scientific discoveries were influenced by his research of the occult and obscure has not been the simplest of tasks.  Newton did not always record his chemical experiments in the most transparent way. Alchemists were notorious for veiling their writings in impenetrable jargon, and Newton made matters even worse by inventing symbols and systems of his own. That is part of the reason why, despite Newton's reputation, many of his manuscripts have still not been properly edited and interpreted. \"They are in a state of considerable disorder,\" Newman says.\n\nEven where the text can be deciphered this only gets you so far. \"Although we can make educated guesses about his chymical work from reading,\" Newman says, \"there are often too many variables in chemical research to make it possible to predict an exact outcome from Newton's notes.\" So Newman and his colleagues set out to repeat the experiments Newton described - using exactly the same conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Phillip|date=2006|title=Newtons Curse|url=|journal=New Scientist|volume=Vol.190(iss.2546)|pages=|via=ProQuest Database}}</ref>\n\n== Biblical studies ==\nIn a manuscript from 1704, Newton describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible and estimates that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this, he said, \"This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail.\"<ref>{{cite news\n |title=Papers Show Isaac Newton's Religious Side, Predict Date of Apocalypse \n |work=The Christian Post \n |date=19 June 2007 \n |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28049_Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton%27s_Religious_Side%2C_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse.htm \n |accessdate=28 May 2018 \n |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070629231937/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28049_Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton's_Religious_Side,_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse.htm \n |archivedate=29 June 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\n=== Newton's studies of the Temple of Solomon ===\n[[File:Isaac Newton's Temple of Solomon.jpg|thumb|right|Isaac Newton's diagram of part of the [[Temple of Solomon]], taken from Plate 1 of [[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]] (published London, 1728)]]\nNewton extensively studied and wrote about the [[Temple of Solomon]], dedicating an entire chapter of ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' to his observations of the temple. Newton's primary source for information was the description of the structure given within [[1 Kings]] of the Hebrew Bible, which he translated himself from [[hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref name=\"TempleInstitute\">{{cite web | last =Richman | first =Rabbi Chaim |author2=Temple Institute | title =Temple Institute: Isaac Newton and the Holy Temple | publisher =Temple Institute | date =1991\u20132008 | url =http://www.templeinstitute.org/isaac_newton_holy_temple.htm | accessdate =1 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to scripture, Newton also relied upon various ancient and contemporary sources while studying the temple.  He believed that many ancient sources were endowed with sacred wisdom<ref name=\"Nova\" /> and that the [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s of many of their temples were in themselves sacred. This belief would lead Newton to examine many architectural works of Hellenistic [[ancient Greece|Greece]], as well as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources such as [[Vitruvius]], in a search for their occult knowledge.

He noted that the temple's measurements given in the Bible are mathematical problems, related to solutions for <math>\\pi</math> and [[Sphere|the volume of a hemisphere]], <math>V = (2/3)\\pi r^3</math>, and in a larger sense that they were references to the size of the [[Earth]] and man's place and proportion to it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nNewton believed that the temple was designed by [[King Solomon]] with privileged eyes and divine guidance.

He believed that these men had hidden their knowledge in a complex code of symbolic and mathematical language that, when deciphered, would reveal an unknown knowledge of how nature works.<ref name=\"Christianson\" />\n\nIn 1675 Newton annotated a copy of ''Manna \u2013 a disquisition of the nature of alchemy'', an anonymous treatise which had been given to him by his fellow scholar [[Ezekiel Foxcroft]]. In his annotation Newton reflected upon his reasons for examining Solomon's Temple by writing:\n\n{{quote|This philosophy, both speculative and active, is not only to be found in the volume of nature, but also in the sacred scriptures, as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Job|Job]], Psalms, Isaiah and others.

In 1628, [[Judah Leon Templo]] produced a model of the temple and surrounding Jerusalem, which was popular in its day. Around 1692, Gerhard Schott produced a highly detailed model of the temple for use in an opera in Hamburg composed by Christian Heinrich Postel. This immense {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} and {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-around}} model was later sold in 1725 and was exhibited in London as early as 1723, and then later temporarily installed at the London [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] from 1729 to 1730, where it could be viewed for [[Half crown (British coin)|half-a-crown]].

In this manuscript he details the necessary requirements for what he considered to be the proper interpretation of the Bible.\n\nIn addition, Newton would spend much of his life seeking and revealing what could be considered a [[Bible Code]]. He placed a great deal of emphasis upon the interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]], writing generously upon this book and authoring several manuscripts detailing his interpretations. Unlike a [[prophet]] in the true sense of the word, Newton relied upon existing Scripture to prophesy for him, believing his interpretations would set the record straight in the face of what he considered to be \"so little understood\".<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Newton\n |first       = Isaac\n |title       = The First Book Concerning the Language of the Prophets\n |publisher   = The Newton Project\n |date        = 5 April 2007\n |url         = http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&mode=normalized\n |accessdate  = 15 August 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108210637/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&mode=normalized\n |archivedate = 8 November 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> In 1754, 27 years after his death, Isaac Newton's treatise, ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'' would be published, and although it does not argue any prophetic meaning, it does exemplify what Newton considered to be just one popular misunderstanding of Scripture.\n\nAlthough Newton's approach to these studies could not be considered a scientific approach, he did write as if his findings were the result of evidence-based research.\n\n=== 2060 ===\nIn late February and early March 2003, a large amount of media attention circulated around the globe regarding largely unknown and unpublished documents, evidently written by Isaac Newton, indicating that he believed the world would end no earlier than 2060. The story garnered vast amounts of public interest and found its way onto the front page of several widely distributed newspapers, including the UK's [[Daily Telegraph]], Canada's [[National Post]], Israel's [[Maariv]] and [[Yediot Aharonot]], and was also featured in an article in the scientific journal ''[[Canadian Journal of History]]''.<ref name=\"Snobelen\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Snobelen\n  | first = Stephen D\n  | title = A time and times and the dividing of time: Isaac Newton, the Apocalypse and A.D. 2060.\n  | journal = The Canadian Journal of History\n  | volume= 38 (December 2003)\n  | pages = 537\u2013551\n  | url = http://www.isaac-newton.org/newton_2060.htm\n  | accessdate = 15 August 2007 }}</ref> Television and internet stories in the following weeks heightened the exposure and ultimately would include the production of several documentary films focused upon the topic of the 2060 prediction and some of Newton's lesser known beliefs and practices.\n\nThe two documents detailing this prediction are currently housed within the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" /> Both were believed to be written toward the end of Newton's life, circa 1705, a time frame most notably established by the use of the full title of ''Sir'' Isaac Newton within portions of the documents.\n\nThese documents do not appear to have been written with the intention of publication and Newton expressed a strong personal dislike for individuals who provided specific dates for the [[Apocalypse]] purely for sensational value. Furthermore, he at no time provides a specific date for the end of the world in either of these documents.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />\n\nTo understand the reasoning behind the 2060 prediction, an understanding of Newton's theological beliefs should be taken into account, particularly his apparent [[antitrinitarian]] beliefs and his Protestant views on the [[Papacy]].  Both of these lay essential to his calculations, which ultimately would provide the 2060 time frame.  See [[Isaac Newton's religious views]] for more details.\n\nThe first document, part of the Yahuda collection,<ref>Yahuda MS 7.3o, f. 8r</ref> is a small letter slip, on the back of which is written haphazardly in Newton's hand:\n{{quote|\nProp. 1. The 2300 prophetick days did not commence before the rise of the little horn of the He Goat.\n\n2 Those day {{sic}} did not commence a[f]ter the destruction of Jerusalem & ye Temple by the Romans A.[D.] 70.\n\n3 The time times & half a time did not commence before the year 800 in wch the Popes supremacy commenced\n\n4 They did not commence after the re[ig]ne of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory the 7th]]. 1084\n\n5 The 1290 days did not commence b[e]fore the year 842.\n\n6 They did not commence after the reigne of Pope Greg. 7th. 1084\n\n7 The diffence {{sic}} between the 1290 & 1335 days are a parts of the seven weeks.\n\nTherefore the 2300 years do not end before ye year 2132 nor after 2370.\nThe time times & half time do n[o]t end before 2060 nor after [2344]\nThe 1290 days do not begin [this should read: end] before 2090 nor after 1374 [sic; Newton probably\nmeans 2374]<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />\n}}\n\nThe second reference to the 2060 prediction can be found in a folio,<ref>Yahuda MS 7.3g, f.\n13v</ref> in which Newton writes:\n{{quote|So then the time times & half a time are 42 months or 1260 days or three years & an half, recconing twelve months to a yeare & 30 days to a month as was done in the Calendar of the primitive year. And the days of short lived Beasts being put for the years of lived [sic for \"long lived\"] kingdoms, the period of 1260 days, if dated from the complete conquest of the three kings A.C. 800, will end A.C. 2060. It may end later, but I see no reason for its ending sooner. This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fancifull men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, & by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail. Christ comes as a thief in the night, & it is not for us to know the times & seasons wch God hath put into his own breast.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />}}\n\nClearly Newton's mathematical prediction of the end of the world is one derived from his interpretation of not only scripture, but also one based upon his theological viewpoint regarding specific chronological dates and events as he saw them.\n\nNewton may not have been referring to the post 2060 event as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the globe and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world, as he saw it, was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace. In Christian and [[Islamic theology]] this concept is often referred to as The [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the establishment of The [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth.  In a separate manuscript,<ref>Yahuda MS 7.2a, f. 31r</ref> Isaac Newton paraphrases Revelation 21 and 22 and relates the post 2060 events by writing:\n{{quote|A new heaven & new earth. New Jerusalem comes down from heaven prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband. The marriage supper. God dwells with men wipes away all tears from their eyes, gives them of ye fountain of living water & creates all thin things new saying, It is done. The glory & felicity of the New Jerusalem is represented by a building of Gold & Gemms enlightened by the glory of God & ye [[Lamb of God|Lamb]] & watered by ye river of Paradise on ye banks of which grows the [[tree of life#Hebrew Bible/Christianity|tree of life]]. Into this city the kings of the earth do bring their glory & that of the nations & the saints reign for ever & ever.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />\n}}\n\n=== 2016 ===\nFor Newton's view of 2016 according to his contemporaries, see [[Religious views of Isaac Newton]]\n\n== Newton's chronology ==\nIsaac Newton wrote extensively upon the historical topic of [[chronology]]. In 1728 ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'', an approximately 87,000-word composition that details the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms was published. The publication date of this work occurred after his death, although the majority of it had been reviewed for publication by Newton himself shortly before he died. As such, this work represents one of his last known personally reviewed publications. Sometime around 1701 he also produced a thirty page unpublished treatise entitled \"The Original of Monarchies\" detailing the rise of several monarchs throughout antiquity and tracing them back to the biblical figure of [[Noah]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Newton | first = Isaac | title = The Original of Monarchies | url = http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00040&mode=normalized | accessdate = 19 August 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108210642/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00040&mode=normalized | archivedate = 8 November 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nNewton's chronological writing is [[Eurocentric]], with the earliest records focusing upon [[Greece]], [[Anatolia]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Levant]]. Many of Newton's dates do not correlate with current historical knowledge. While Newton mentions several pre-historical events found within the Bible, the oldest actual historical date he provides is 1125 BC. In this entry he mentions [[Mephres]], a ruler over [[Upper Egypt]] from the territories of Syene to [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], and his successor [[Misphragmuthosis]]. However, during 1125 BC the Pharaoh of Egypt is now understood to be [[Ramesses IX]].\n\nAlthough some of the dates Newton provides for various events are accurate by 17th century standards, [[archaeology]] as a form of modern science did not exist in Newton's time. In fact, the majority of the conclusionary dates which Newton cites are based on the works of [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Plutarch]], [[Homer]], and various other classical historians, authors, and poets; themselves often citing secondary sources and oral records of uncertain date. Newton's approach to chronology was focused upon gathering historical information from various sources found throughout antiquity and cataloguing them according to their appropriate date by his contemporary understanding, standards, and available source material.\n\n=== Newton's Atlantis ===\nFound within ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'', are several passages that directly mention the land of [[Atlantis]]. The first such passage is part of his ''Short Chronicle'' which indicates his belief that Homer's [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] left the island of [[Ogygia]] in 896 BC. In [[Greek mythology]], Ogygia was home to [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], the daughter of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] (after whom Atlantis was named). Some scholars have suggested that Ogygia and Atlantis are locationally connected, or possibly the same island. From his writings it appears Newton may have shared this belief. Newton also lists Cadis or Cales as possible candidates for Ogygia, though does not cite his reasons for believing so.\n\n== Newton and secret societies ==\nIsaac Newton has often been associated with various [[secret societies]] and [[fraternal orders]] throughout history.  Due to the secretive nature of such organizations, lack of supportive publicized material, and dubious motives for claiming Newton's participation in these groups, it is difficult to establish his actual membership in any specific organization.<ref name=\"NEWTONSFREEMASONRY\">{{Cite book | last =Bauer | first =Alain | publicationdate =2007 | title = Isaac Newton's Freemasonary: The Alchemy of Science and Mysticism | location = Originally published as: Aux origines de la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie: Newton et les Newtoniens by Editions Dervy (2003)| publisher =Inner Traditions | pages =Book Excerpt \u2013 from Chapter 3 | isbn =978-1-59477-172-9 | doi = | oclc = | url =http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/book_bauer.html | accessdate =25 June 2008 | nopp =true | date =2007 | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> and by virtue of the number of masonic buildings have been dedicated in his honour.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.newtonmasonic.org/ | title = Newton Masonic Lodges | accessdate = 16 September 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831223420/http://www.newtonmasonic.org/ | archivedate = 31 August 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nRegardless of his own membership status, Newton was a known associate of many individuals who themselves have often been labeled as members of various esoteric groups. It is unclear if these associations were a result of his being a well established and prominently publicized scholar, an early member and sitting [[President of the Royal Society]] (1703\u20131727), a prominent figure of State and [[Master of the Mint]], a recognized [[Knight]], or if Newton actually sought active membership within these esoteric organizations himself.  Considering the nature and legality of alchemical practices during his lifetime, as well as his possession of various materials and manuscripts pertaining to alchemical research, Newton may very well have been a member of a group of like minded thinkers and colleagues. The organized level of this group (if in fact any existed), the level of their secrecy, as well as the depth of Newton's involvement within them, remains unclear.\n\nAlthough Newton was largely considered a reclusive personality and not prone to socializing, during his lifetime being a member of \"Societies\" or \"Clubs\" was a very popular form of interpersonal networking. Considering his esteemed social status, it is probable that Newton would have had a least some contact with such groups at various levels. He was most certainly a member of [[The Royal Society]] of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge and the [[Spalding Gentlemen's Society]],<ref name=\"Stukeley\">{{cite book|last=Stukeley|first=William|authorlink=William Stukeley|editor=Rob Iliffe |editor2=Scott Mandelbrote |title=Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's life|origyear= 1752 |url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001|edition=transcript|date=2010|publisher=The Newton Project|location=University of Sussex|type=AHRC Newton Papers Project, Ms. 142, The Royal Society Library, London}}</ref><ref name=\"SPALDING\">{{cite web | title =Spalding Gentlemen's Society | url =http://www.spalding-gentlemens-society.org | accessdate =25 June 2008 }}</ref> however, these are considered [[learned societies]], not [[secret societies|esoteric societies]]. Newton's membership status within any particular secret society remains verifiably allusive and largely speculative, however, it still lends itself to popular sensationalism.\n\n=== Newton and the Rosicrucians ===\nPerhaps the movement which most influenced Isaac Newton was [[Rosicrucianism]].<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\">{{Cite book | last =White | first =Michael| publicationdate = | date =1999 | title =Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer | publisher =Da Capo Press | page =117 | isbn =978-0-7382-0143-6 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C | accessdate =25 June 2008 | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> Although the Rosicrucian movement had caused a great deal of excitement within Europe's scholarly community during the early seventeenth century, by the time Newton had reached maturity the movement had become less sensationalized. However, the Rosicrucian movement still would have a profound influence upon Newton, particularly in regard to his alchemical work and philosophical thought.\n\nThe Rosicrucian belief in being specially chosen for the ability to communicate with angels or spirits is echoed in Newton's prophetic beliefs. Additionally, the Rosicrucians proclaimed to have the ability to live forever through the use of the ''[[Elixir of Life|elixir vitae]]'' and the ability to produce limitless amounts of time and gold from the use of the [[philosopher's stone]], which they claimed to have in their possession. Like Newton, the Rosicrucians were deeply religious, avowedly Christian, anti-Catholic, and highly politicised. Isaac Newton would have a deep interest in not just their alchemical pursuits, but also their belief in esoteric truths of the ancient past and the belief in enlightened individuals with the ability to gain insight into nature, the physical universe, and the spiritual realm.<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\" />\n\nAt the time of his death, Isaac Newton had 169 books on the topic of alchemy in his personal library, and was believed to have considerably more books on this topic during his Cambridge years, though he may have sold them before moving to London in 1696. For its time, his was considered one of the finest alchemical libraries in the world. In his library, Newton left behind a heavily annotated personal copy of ''The Fame and Confession of the Fraternity R.C.'', by [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] which represents an English translation of [[Rosicrucian Manifestos|The Rosicrucian Manifestos]]. Newton also possessed copies of ''[[Themis Aurea]]'' and ''[[Symbola Aurea Mensae Duodecium]]'' by the learned alchemist [[Michael Maier]], both of which are significant early books about the Rosicrucian movement. These books were also extensively annotated by Newton.<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\" />\n\nNewton's ownership of these materials by no means denotes membership within any early Rosicrucian order. Furthermore, considering that his personal alchemical investigations were focused upon discovering materials which the Rosicrucians professed to already be in possession of long before he was born, would seem to some to exclude Newton from their membership. However, in religious terms, the fact that a saint might have 'found God' would not preclude others from the search \u2013 quite the opposite. The Ancient & Mystical Order Rosae Crucis has always claimed Newton as a frater.<ref>Lewis, H. Spencer 1981, ''Rosicrucian Questions and Answers with Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order'', 15th edn, The Rosicrucian Press Ltd, San Jose, Calif. USA.</ref> During his own life, Newton was openly 'accused' of being a Rosicrucian, as were many members of The Royal Society.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yates |first=Frances A. |date=1972 |title=The Rosicrucian Enlightenment |publisher=Routledge |location=London}}</ref> Although it is not known for sure if Isaac Newton was in fact a Rosicrucian, and he never publicly identified himself as one, from his writings it does appear that he may have shared many of their sentiments and beliefs.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dobbs, Betty Jo Teeter.

These works explored [[chronology]], [[alchemy]], and [[Biblical hermeneutics|Biblical interpretation]] (especially of the [[Apocalypse]]). Newton's scientific work may have been of lesser personal importance to him, as he placed emphasis on rediscovering the occult wisdom of the ancients. In this sense, some historians, including economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], believe that any reference to a \"Newtonian Worldview\" as being purely mechanical in nature is somewhat inaccurate.<ref>Keynes, J.M., 'Newton, The Man'; Proceedings of the Royal Society Newton Tercentenary Celebrations, 15\u201319 July 1946; Cambridge University Press (1947)</ref> Historical research on Newton's occult studies in relation to his science have also been used to challenge the [[disenchantment]] narrative within [[critical theory]].<ref>{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | pages = 43 and Chapter 2, ''passim'' |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref>\n\nAfter purchasing and studying Newton's alchemical works, Keynes, for example, opined in 1942 at the [[tercentenary]] of his birth that \"Newton was not the first of the [[age of reason]], he was the last of the [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]].\" In the [[Early Modern Period]] of Newton's lifetime, the educated embraced a [[world view]] different from that of later centuries. Distinctions between science, [[superstition]], and [[pseudoscience]] were still being formulated, and a devoutly Christian biblical perspective permeated Western culture.\n\n==Alchemical research==\nMuch of what are known as Isaac Newton's [[occult]] studies can largely be attributed to his study of [[alchemy]].<ref>\"Newton's manuscripts provide evidence that he gave considerable thought to alchemy as emblematic of a purely scientific explanation of nature and was in fact deeply involved in conceiving alchemy as spiritual.\" F. Calian, \"Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy\" in ''Annual of Medieval Studies'' at CEU (2010), 186.</ref> From a young age, Newton was deeply interested in all forms of [[natural sciences]] and [[materials science]], an interest which would ultimately lead to some of his better-known contributions to science. His earliest encounters with certain alchemical theories and practices were during his childhood, when a twelve year old Isaac Newton was boarding in the attic of an apothecaries shop.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Isaac the Alchemist: Secrets of Isaac Newton|last=Losure|first=Mary|publisher=Candlewick Press|year=2017|isbn=9780763670634|location=Somerville, MA|pages=}}</ref> During Newton's lifetime, the study of [[chemistry]] was still in its infancy, so many of his experimental studies used esoteric language and vague terminology more typically associated with alchemy and occultism.<ref>\"his alchemy cannot be seen solely in connection with his chemical experiments but was also a link between his religious beliefs and his scientific aims\". Karin Figala, \"Newton's Alchemy,\" in The Cambridge Companion to Newton, ed. I. Bernard Cohen and George Edwin Smith (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 375.</ref> It was not until several decades after Newton's death that experiments of [[stoichiometry]] under the pioneering works of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] were conducted, and analytical chemistry, with its associated nomenclature, came to resemble modern chemistry as we know it today. However, Newton's contemporary and fellow Royal Society member, [[Robert Boyle]], had already discovered the basic concepts of modern chemistry and began establishing modern norms of experimental practice and communication in chemistry, information which Newton did not use.\n\nMuch of Newton's writing on alchemy may have been lost in a fire in his laboratory, so the true extent of his work in this area may have been larger than is currently known. Newton also suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during his period of alchemical work, possibly due to some form of chemical poisoning (perhaps from [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], lead, or some other substance).<ref name=\"Nova\" />\n\n[[File:Isaac Newton laboratory fire.jpg|thumb|left|An 1874 engraving showing a probably apocryphal account of Newton's lab fire.

[[English crown|The English Crown]], also fearing the potential devaluation of gold because of the creation of fake gold, made penalties for alchemy very severe. In some cases the punishment for unsanctioned alchemy would include the public hanging of an offender on a gilded scaffold while adorned with tinsel and other unspecified items.<ref name=\"Nova\" />\n\nHe needed to be discreet about alchemy since: alchemy was a vector of heretical ideas and mobs were lynching heretics; alchemy provided technical knowledge about counterfeiting money. So, alchemy was considered dangerous.<ref>''Newton: The Dark Heretic'', BBC, 2003.</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, the question of the nature and degree of influence of alchemy on Newton\u2019s main works, \u201c[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]\u201d and \u201cOptics\u201d has been actively discussed. At present, the understanding that there is a connection between the alchemical and natural science views of Newton has become generally accepted. Some historians of science express an opinion on the decisive nature of the influence of alchemy, occultism and hermetism on the theory of forces and gravity. A discussion of Newton's alchemical studies had a significant impact on the understanding of the [[scientific revolution]].\n\n==Writings==\nDue to the threat of punishment and the potential scrutiny he feared from his peers within the scientific community, Newton may have deliberately left his work on alchemical subjects unpublished. Newton was well known as being highly sensitive to criticism, such as the numerous instances when he was criticized by [[Robert Hooke]], and his admitted reluctance to publish any substantial information regarding [[calculus]] before 1693. A perfectionist by nature, Newton also refrained from publication of material that he felt was incomplete, as evident from a 38-year gap from Newton's conception of calculus in 1666 and its final full publication in 1704, which would ultimately lead to the infamous [[Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy]].\n\nMost of the scientist\u2019s manuscript heritage after his death passed to [[John Conduitt]], the husband of his niece [[Catherine Barton|Catherine]]{{#tag:ref|For more information on Newton\u2019s archive, see {{sfn|Iliffe|1998|pp=137\u2014158}}.}}. To evaluate the manuscripts, physician Thomas Pellet was involved, who decided that only \u201c[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended|the Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms]]\u201d, an unreleased fragment of \u201c[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]\u201d, \"Obsevations upon the Prophesies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John\" and \"Paradoxical Questions Concerning the Morals and Actions of Athanasius and His Followers\" were suitable for publication. The remaining manuscripts, according to Pellet, were \"foul draughts of the Prophetic stile\" and were not suitable for publication. After the death of J. Conduitt in 1737, manuscripts were transferred to Catherine, who unsuccessfully tried to publish theological notes of her uncle. She consulted with Newton's friend, the theologian [[Arthur Ashley Sykes]] (1684\u20141756). Sykes kept 11 manuscripts for himself, and the rest of the archive passed into the family of Catherine's daughter, who married the [[John Wallop, Viscount Lymington]], and was then owned by the [[Earl of Portsmouth|Earls of Portsmouth]]. Sykes' documents after his death came to the Rev. [[Jeffery Ekins]] (d. 1791) and were kept in the family of the latter until they were presented to the [[New College, Oxford]] in 1872{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432|1999|pp=7\u20148}}. Until the mid-19th century, few had access to the Portsmouth collection, including David Brewster, a renowned physicist and biographer of Newton. In 1872, the fifth Earl of Portsmouth transferred part of the manuscripts (mainly of a physical and mathematical nature) to [[Cambridge University]].\n\nIn 1936, a collection of Isaac Newton's unpublished works were auctioned by [[Sotheby's]] on behalf of [[Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth]]. Known as the \"Portsmouth Papers\", this material consisted of 329 lots of Newton's manuscripts, over a third of which were filled with content that appeared to be alchemical in nature. At the time of Newton's death this material was considered \"unfit to publish\" by Newton's estate, and consequently fell into obscurity until their somewhat sensational reemergence in 1936.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Newman\n |first       = William R.\n |title       = Newton and Alchemy\n |publisher   = The Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project\n |date        = 5 April 2007\n |url         = http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/about.do\n |accessdate  = 12 August 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807181322/http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/about.do\n |archivedate = 7 August 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nAt the auction many of these documents, along with Newton's [[death mask]], were purchased by economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who throughout his life collected many of Newton's alchemical writings.<ref name=\"Gleick2004\">{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|authorlink=James Gleick|title=Isaac Newton|url={{Google books|t2-KDQAAQBAJ|page=188|plainurl=yes}}|year=2004|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3295-2|page=188}}</ref> Much of the Keynes collection later passed to eccentric document collector [[Abraham Yahuda]], who was himself a vigorous collector of Isaac Newton's original manuscripts.\n\nMany of the documents collected by Keynes and Yahuda are now in the [[Jewish National and University Library]] in Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|reason=Newton Project says King's College|date=December 2016}} In recent years, several projects have begun to gather, catalogue, and transcribe the fragmented collection of Newton's work on alchemical subjects and make them freely available for on-line access.

Most notably are documents entitled ''Artephius his secret Book'', followed by ''The Epistle of Iohn Pontanus, wherein he beareth witness of ye book of Artephius''; these are themselves a collection of excerpts from another work entitled ''Nicholas Flammel, His Exposition of the Hieroglyphicall Figures'' which he caused to be painted upon an Arch in St Innocents Church-yard in Paris. Together with ''The secret Booke of Artephius, And the Epistle of Iohn Pontanus: Containing both the Theoricke and the Practicke of the Philosophers Stone''. This work may also have been referenced by Newton in its Latin version found within [[Lazarus Zetzner]]'s ''[[Theatrum Chemicum]]'', a volume often associated with the ''[[Turba Philosophorum]]'' and other early European alchemical manuscripts. [[Nicolas Flamel]], one subject of the aforementioned work, was a notable, though mysterious figure, often associated with the discovery of the philosopher's stone, hieroglyphical figures, early forms of [[tarot]], and occultism. [[Artephius]], and his \"secret book\", were also subjects of interest to 17th-century alchemists.\n\nAlso in the 1936 auction of Newton's collection was ''The Epitome of the treasure of health written by Edwardus Generosus Anglicus innominatus who lived Anno Domini 1562''. This is a twenty-eight-page treatise on the philosopher's stone, the Animal or [[Angelicall Stone]], the Prospective stone or magical stone of Moses, and the vegetable or the growing stone.  The treatise concludes with an alchemical poem.\n\n===== The Principia =====\nMany of the discoveries and mathematical formula found within Newton's ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' can be linked, often very directly, to his occult and alchemical studies.  Much of his research into the movement of heavenly bodies was influenced by his belief that there are invisible, occult forces at work in the orbits of celestial bodies. Other natural philosophers, most notably Descartes, tended to object to this notion and insisted instead that action depended on physical contact, proposing that celestial objects were moved about by a great many small particles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Newton: The Making of a Genius|last=Fara|first=Patricia|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780231128063|location=New York|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/newtonmakingofge00fara}}</ref>\n\nThe second book of the Principia has not withstood the test of time.\u00a0Much of the work within this volume revolved around measuring air resistance on the motion of pendulums and spheres.\u00a0 Some believe that the main corpus of this work was ultimately an effort to refute Descartes\u2019s Cartesian theory of Vortices, according to which, planetary motion was produced by whirling fluid vortices that filled interplanetary space. This motion supposedly carried the planets with them.\u00a0 As a spiritual man, and as an alchemist, Newton was determined that the motion of heavenly bodies was motivated by invisible forces, that natural phenomena were motivated by forces spiritual, not merely physical.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton|last=Westfall|first=R.S.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980|isbn=978-0521274357|location=UK|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/neveratrestbiogr00west}}</ref>\n\n===== \"The Key\" a.k.a ''Newton's Clavis'' =====\nA fragmentary alchemical text which, in 1975, became \"generally accepted as\" to be penned by Newton.  Its authorship was immediately questioned by Karin Figala, and in 1988 William Newman conclusively proved it to be a composition by George Starkey; this fact has been repeated in a dozen publications since, and no scholar now thinks the \"Key\" is Newton's.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=P.H.|date=2005|title=The Alchemy Reader: From Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton|url=|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|volume=Vol.38(iss.138).|pages=|via=ProQuest Database}}</ref>\n\n===== Other works =====\nWilliam Newman, a leading scholar of the history of science, has collected many of Newton's alchemical writings.\n\nNewton's various surviving alchemical notebooks clearly show that he made no distinctions between alchemy and what we today consider science. The very same pages in which we find the recordings of his legendary optics experiments we also find various recipes culled from arcane sources. \"Alongside sober explanations of optical and physical phenomena such as freezing and boiling,\" Newman says, \"we find 'Neptune's Trident', 'Mercury's Caducean Rod' and the 'Green Lion', all symbolising alchemical substances.\"\n\nDetermining that many of Newton's acclaimed scientific discoveries were influenced by his research of the occult and obscure has not been the simplest of tasks.  Newton did not always record his chemical experiments in the most transparent way. Alchemists were notorious for veiling their writings in impenetrable jargon, and Newton made matters even worse by inventing symbols and systems of his own. That is part of the reason why, despite Newton's reputation, many of his manuscripts have still not been properly edited and interpreted. \"They are in a state of considerable disorder,\" Newman says.\n\nEven where the text can be deciphered this only gets you so far. \"Although we can make educated guesses about his chymical work from reading,\" Newman says, \"there are often too many variables in chemical research to make it possible to predict an exact outcome from Newton's notes.\" So Newman and his colleagues set out to repeat the experiments Newton described - using exactly the same conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Phillip|date=2006|title=Newtons Curse|url=|journal=New Scientist|volume=Vol.190(iss.2546)|pages=|via=ProQuest Database}}</ref>\n\n== Biblical studies ==\nIn a manuscript from 1704, Newton describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible and estimates that the world would end no earlier than 2060.

He believed that many ancient sources were endowed with sacred wisdom<ref name=\"Nova\" /> and that the [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s of many of their temples were in themselves sacred. This belief would lead Newton to examine many architectural works of Hellenistic [[ancient Greece|Greece]], as well as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources such as [[Vitruvius]], in a search for their occult knowledge.

He believed that these men had hidden their knowledge in a complex code of symbolic and mathematical language that, when deciphered, would reveal an unknown knowledge of how nature works.<ref name=\"Christianson\" />\n\nIn 1675 Newton annotated a copy of ''Manna \u2013 a disquisition of the nature of alchemy'', an anonymous treatise which had been given to him by his fellow scholar [[Ezekiel Foxcroft]]. In his annotation Newton reflected upon his reasons for examining Solomon's Temple by writing:\n\n{{quote|This philosophy, both speculative and active, is not only to be found in the volume of nature, but also in the sacred scriptures, as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Job|Job]], Psalms, Isaiah and others.

In 1628, [[Judah Leon Templo]] produced a model of the temple and surrounding Jerusalem, which was popular in its day. Around 1692, Gerhard Schott produced a highly detailed model of the temple for use in an opera in Hamburg composed by Christian Heinrich Postel. This immense {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} and {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-around}} model was later sold in 1725 and was exhibited in London as early as 1723, and then later temporarily installed at the London [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] from 1729 to 1730, where it could be viewed for [[Half crown (British coin)|half-a-crown]].

In this manuscript he details the necessary requirements for what he considered to be the proper interpretation of the Bible.\n\nIn addition, Newton would spend much of his life seeking and revealing what could be considered a [[Bible Code]]. He placed a great deal of emphasis upon the interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]], writing generously upon this book and authoring several manuscripts detailing his interpretations. Unlike a [[prophet]] in the true sense of the word, Newton relied upon existing Scripture to prophesy for him, believing his interpretations would set the record straight in the face of what he considered to be \"so little understood\".<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Newton\n |first       = Isaac\n |title       = The First Book Concerning the Language of the Prophets\n |publisher   = The Newton Project\n |date        = 5 April 2007\n |url         = http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&mode=normalized\n |accessdate  = 15 August 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108210637/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&mode=normalized\n |archivedate = 8 November 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> In 1754, 27 years after his death, Isaac Newton's treatise, ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'' would be published, and although it does not argue any prophetic meaning, it does exemplify what Newton considered to be just one popular misunderstanding of Scripture.\n\nAlthough Newton's approach to these studies could not be considered a scientific approach, he did write as if his findings were the result of evidence-based research.\n\n=== 2060 ===\nIn late February and early March 2003, a large amount of media attention circulated around the globe regarding largely unknown and unpublished documents, evidently written by Isaac Newton, indicating that he believed the world would end no earlier than 2060.

Furthermore, he at no time provides a specific date for the end of the world in either of these documents.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />\n\nTo understand the reasoning behind the 2060 prediction, an understanding of Newton's theological beliefs should be taken into account, particularly his apparent [[antitrinitarian]] beliefs and his Protestant views on the [[Papacy]].

Christ comes as a thief in the night, & it is not for us to know the times & seasons wch God hath put into his own breast.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />}}\n\nClearly Newton's mathematical prediction of the end of the world is one derived from his interpretation of not only scripture, but also one based upon his theological viewpoint regarding specific chronological dates and events as he saw them.\n\nNewton may not have been referring to the post 2060 event as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the globe and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world, as he saw it, was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace. In Christian and [[Islamic theology]] this concept is often referred to as The [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the establishment of The [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth.  In a separate manuscript,<ref>Yahuda MS 7.2a, f. 31r</ref> Isaac Newton paraphrases Revelation 21 and 22 and relates the post 2060 events by writing:\n{{quote|A new heaven & new earth. New Jerusalem comes down from heaven prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband. The marriage supper. God dwells with men wipes away all tears from their eyes, gives them of ye fountain of living water & creates all thin things new saying, It is done. The glory & felicity of the New Jerusalem is represented by a building of Gold & Gemms enlightened by the glory of God & ye [[Lamb of God|Lamb]] & watered by ye river of Paradise on ye banks of which grows the [[tree of life#Hebrew Bible/Christianity|tree of life]]. Into this city the kings of the earth do bring their glory & that of the nations & the saints reign for ever & ever.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />\n}}\n\n=== 2016 ===\nFor Newton's view of 2016 according to his contemporaries, see [[Religious views of Isaac Newton]]\n\n== Newton's chronology ==\nIsaac Newton wrote extensively upon the historical topic of [[chronology]]. In 1728 ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'', an approximately 87,000-word composition that details the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms was published. The publication date of this work occurred after his death, although the majority of it had been reviewed for publication by Newton himself shortly before he died. As such, this work represents one of his last known personally reviewed publications. Sometime around 1701 he also produced a thirty page unpublished treatise entitled \"The Original of Monarchies\" detailing the rise of several monarchs throughout antiquity and tracing them back to the biblical figure of [[Noah]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Newton | first = Isaac | title = The Original of Monarchies | url = http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00040&mode=normalized | accessdate = 19 August 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108210642/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00040&mode=normalized | archivedate = 8 November 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nNewton's chronological writing is [[Eurocentric]], with the earliest records focusing upon [[Greece]], [[Anatolia]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Levant]]. Many of Newton's dates do not correlate with current historical knowledge. While Newton mentions several pre-historical events found within the Bible, the oldest actual historical date he provides is 1125 BC. In this entry he mentions [[Mephres]], a ruler over [[Upper Egypt]] from the territories of Syene to [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], and his successor [[Misphragmuthosis]]. However, during 1125 BC the Pharaoh of Egypt is now understood to be [[Ramesses IX]].\n\nAlthough some of the dates Newton provides for various events are accurate by 17th century standards, [[archaeology]] as a form of modern science did not exist in Newton's time. In fact, the majority of the conclusionary dates which Newton cites are based on the works of [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Plutarch]], [[Homer]], and various other classical historians, authors, and poets; themselves often citing secondary sources and oral records of uncertain date. Newton's approach to chronology was focused upon gathering historical information from various sources found throughout antiquity and cataloguing them according to their appropriate date by his contemporary understanding, standards, and available source material.\n\n=== Newton's Atlantis ===\nFound within ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'', are several passages that directly mention the land of [[Atlantis]]. The first such passage is part of his ''Short Chronicle'' which indicates his belief that Homer's [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] left the island of [[Ogygia]] in 896 BC. In [[Greek mythology]], Ogygia was home to [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], the daughter of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] (after whom Atlantis was named). Some scholars have suggested that Ogygia and Atlantis are locationally connected, or possibly the same island. From his writings it appears Newton may have shared this belief. Newton also lists Cadis or Cales as possible candidates for Ogygia, though does not cite his reasons for believing so.\n\n== Newton and secret societies ==\nIsaac Newton has often been associated with various [[secret societies]] and [[fraternal orders]] throughout history.  Due to the secretive nature of such organizations, lack of supportive publicized material, and dubious motives for claiming Newton's participation in these groups, it is difficult to establish his actual membership in any specific organization.<ref name=\"NEWTONSFREEMASONRY\">{{Cite book | last =Bauer | first =Alain | publicationdate =2007 | title = Isaac Newton's Freemasonary: The Alchemy of Science and Mysticism | location = Originally published as: Aux origines de la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie: Newton et les Newtoniens by Editions Dervy (2003)| publisher =Inner Traditions | pages =Book Excerpt \u2013 from Chapter 3 | isbn =978-1-59477-172-9 | doi = | oclc = | url =http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/book_bauer.html | accessdate =25 June 2008 | nopp =true | date =2007 | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> | archivedate = 5 March 2017 | url-status = live}}</ref> and by virtue of the number of masonic buildings have been dedicated in his honour.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.newtonmasonic.org/ | title = Newton Masonic Lodges | accessdate = 16 September 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831223420/http://www.newtonmasonic.org/ | archivedate = 31 August 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nRegardless of his own membership status, Newton was a known associate of many individuals who themselves have often been labeled as members of various esoteric groups. It is unclear if these associations were a result of his being a well established and prominently publicized scholar, an early member and sitting [[President of the Royal Society]] (1703\u20131727), a prominent figure of State and [[Master of the Mint]], a recognized [[Knight]], or if Newton actually sought active membership within these esoteric organizations himself.  Considering the nature and legality of alchemical practices during his lifetime, as well as his possession of various materials and manuscripts pertaining to alchemical research, Newton may very well have been a member of a group of like minded thinkers and colleagues. The organized level of this group (if in fact any existed), the level of their secrecy, as well as the depth of Newton's involvement within them, remains unclear.\n\nAlthough Newton was largely considered a reclusive personality and not prone to socializing, during his lifetime being a member of \"Societies\" or \"Clubs\" was a very popular form of interpersonal networking. Considering his esteemed social status, it is probable that Newton would have had a least some contact with such groups at various levels. He was most certainly a member of [[The Royal Society]] of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge and the [[Spalding Gentlemen's Society]],<ref name=\"Stukeley\">{{cite book|last=Stukeley|first=William|authorlink=William Stukeley|editor=Rob Iliffe |editor2=Scott Mandelbrote |title=Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's life|origyear= 1752 |url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001|edition=transcript|date=2010|publisher=The Newton Project|location=University of Sussex|type=AHRC Newton Papers Project, Ms. 142, The Royal Society Library, London}}</ref><ref name=\"SPALDING\">{{cite web | title =Spalding Gentlemen's Society | url =http://www.spalding-gentlemens-society.org | accessdate =25 June 2008 }}</ref> however, these are considered [[learned societies]], not [[secret societies|esoteric societies]]. Newton's membership status within any particular secret society remains verifiably allusive and largely speculative, however, it still lends itself to popular sensationalism.\n\n=== Newton and the Rosicrucians ===\nPerhaps the movement which most influenced Isaac Newton was [[Rosicrucianism]].<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\">{{Cite book | last =White | first =Michael| publicationdate = | date =1999 | title =Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer | publisher =Da Capo Press | page =117 | isbn =978-0-7382-0143-6 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C | accessdate =25 June 2008 | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> Although the Rosicrucian movement had caused a great deal of excitement within Europe's scholarly community during the early seventeenth century, by the time Newton had reached maturity the movement had become less sensationalized. However, the Rosicrucian movement still would have a profound influence upon Newton, particularly in regard to his alchemical work and philosophical thought.\n\nThe Rosicrucian belief in being specially chosen for the ability to communicate with angels or spirits is echoed in Newton's prophetic beliefs. Additionally, the Rosicrucians proclaimed to have the ability to live forever through the use of the ''[[Elixir of Life|elixir vitae]]'' and the ability to produce limitless amounts of time and gold from the use of the [[philosopher's stone]], which they claimed to have in their possession. Like Newton, the Rosicrucians were deeply religious, avowedly Christian, anti-Catholic, and highly politicised. Isaac Newton would have a deep interest in not just their alchemical pursuits, but also their belief in esoteric truths of the ancient past and the belief in enlightened individuals with the ability to gain insight into nature, the physical universe, and the spiritual realm.<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\" />\n\nAt the time of his death, Isaac Newton had 169 books on the topic of alchemy in his personal library, and was believed to have considerably more books on this topic during his Cambridge years, though he may have sold them before moving to London in 1696. For its time, his was considered one of the finest alchemical libraries in the world. In his library, Newton left behind a heavily annotated personal copy of ''The Fame and Confession of the Fraternity R.C.'', by [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] which represents an English translation of [[Rosicrucian Manifestos|The Rosicrucian Manifestos]]. Newton also possessed copies of ''[[Themis Aurea]]'' and ''[[Symbola Aurea Mensae Duodecium]]'' by the learned alchemist [[Michael Maier]], both of which are significant early books about the Rosicrucian movement. These books were also extensively annotated by Newton.<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\" />\n\nNewton's ownership of these materials by no means denotes membership within any early Rosicrucian order. Furthermore, considering that his personal alchemical investigations were focused upon discovering materials which the Rosicrucians professed to already be in possession of long before he was born, would seem to some to exclude Newton from their membership. However, in religious terms, the fact that a saint might have 'found God' would not preclude others from the search \u2013 quite the opposite. The Ancient & Mystical Order Rosae Crucis has always claimed Newton as a frater.<ref>Lewis, H. Spencer 1981, ''Rosicrucian Questions and Answers with Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order'', 15th edn, The Rosicrucian Press Ltd, San Jose, Calif. USA.</ref> During his own life, Newton was openly 'accused' of being a Rosicrucian, as were many members of The Royal Society.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yates |first=Frances A. |date=1972 |title=The Rosicrucian Enlightenment |publisher=Routledge |location=London}}</ref> Although it is not known for sure if Isaac Newton was in fact a Rosicrucian, and he never publicly identified himself as one, from his writings it does appear that he may have shared many of their sentiments and beliefs.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dobbs, Betty Jo Teeter.

{"title_page": "Backpacking (hiking)", "text_new": "{{short description|Outdoor recreation of carrying gear on one's back, while hiking for more than a day. It is often but not always an extended journey, and may or may not involve camping outdoors}}\n{{Otheruses|Hiking|Camping|Backpacking (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Backpacking in Grand Teton NP-NPS.jpg|thumb|Backpacking in the [[Grand Teton National Park]], [[Wyoming]]]]\n[[File:Backpacking in polish carpathians cm01.jpg|thumb|Backpacking in the [[Beskids|Beskid Niski]] mountains, in the Polish part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]]]\n\n'''Backpacking''' is the outdoor recreation of carrying gear on one's back, while [[hiking]] for more than a day. It is often but not always an extended journey,<ref>\"Travel or hike carrying one's belongings in a backpack: [e.g.] a week's backpacking in the [[Pyrenees]], [or] he has backpacked around the world\" (''New Oxford American Dictionary'').</ref> and may or may not involve [[camping]] outdoors. In North America tenting is common, where simple shelters and [[mountain hut]]s widely found in Europe are rare. In New Zealand, [[Tramping in New Zealand|tramping]] is the term applied though overnight huts are frequently used.<ref>H. W. Orsman, ''The Dictionary of New Zealand English''. Auckland: Oxford University Press, 1999.</ref> [[Hill walking]] is an equivalent in Britain (but this can also refer to a day walk), though backpackers make use of all kinds of accommodation, in addition to camping. Backpackers use simple huts in South Africa.<ref name=\"footprint.co.za\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.footprint.co.za/Development_introduction.htm |title=Trail Development}}</ref> '''Trekking''' and [[bushwalking]] are other word used to describe such multi-day trips.\n\nBackpacking [[backpacking (travel)|as a method of travel]] is a different activity, which mainly uses [[public transport]] during a journey which can last months.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Mountain Jack and a Wandering Miner .jpg|thumb|A backpacker during the [[California Gold Rush]]]]\nBackpacking is an [[outdoor recreation]] where gear is carried in a [[backpack]]. This can include food, water, bedding, shelter, clothing, stove, and cooking kit. Weight is necessarily key. Backpacking trips range from one night to weeks or months, sometimes aided by planned resupply points or drops.\n\n==Accommodations==\n[[File:Pocosin cabin.jpg|thumb|The Pocosin cabin along the [[Appalachian trail]] in [[Shenandoah National Park]] ]]\nBackpacking camps are usually more spartan than campsites where gear is transported by car or boat. In areas with heavy backpacker traffic, a hike-in campsite might have a [[fire ring]] (where permissible), an [[outhouse]], a wooden bulletin board with a [[map]] and information about the trail and area. Many hike-in camps are no more than level patches of ground free of underbrush. In remote [[wilderness]] areas hikers must choose their own site. Established camps are rare and the ethos is to \"leave no trace\" when gone.\n\n\nIn some regions, varying forms of accommodation exist, from simple log lean-to's to staffed facilities offering escalating degrees of service. Beds, meals, and even drinks may be had at [[Alps|Alpine]] [[mountain hut|hut]]s scattered among well-traveled European mountains. Backpackers there can walk from hut-to-hut without leaving the mountains, while in places like the [[Lake District]] or [[Yorkshire Dales]] in England hill-walkers descend to stay in [[Youth hostel]]s, farmhouses or [[guest house]]s.\n\nIn the more remote parts of Great Britain, especially Scotland, [[bothy|bothies]] exist to provide simple (free) accommodation for backpackers. On the French system of [[long distance trail]]s, ''[[Grande Randonn\u00e9e]]''s, backpackers can stay in ''g\u00eetes d'etapes'', which are simple hostels provided for walkers and cyclists. There are some simple shelters and occasional mountain hut also provided in North America, including on the [[Appalachian trail]]. Another example is the High Sierra Camps in the [[Yosemite National Park]]. Long-distance backpacking trails with huts also exist in South Africa, including the 100&nbsp;km plus [[Amatola Trail]], in the [[Eastern Cape]] Province.<ref name=\"footprint.co.za\" /> Backpacking (trekking) is also popular in the [[Himalayas]], where [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] and [[pack animals]] are often used. <ref>{{Cite book |last=Zurick, Pacheco |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S20hk99x_-MC |title=Illustrated Atlas of the Himalaya |last2=J.Shrestha |last3=Bajracharya, B. |publisher=India Research Press |year=2006 |isbn=9788183860376}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n== Equipment ==\n[[File:Tent at High Shelf Camp.jpg|thumb|A backpacker's modern lightweight dome tent near [[Mount Anne]] in a [[Tasmanian Wilderness]] area]]\n{{main|Hiking equipment}}{{Further|Outdoor equipment}}\nBackpacking gear begins with (1) a suitable [[backpack]], proper both in size and fit. Backpacks in general fall into one of four categories: frameless, external frame, internal frame, and bodypack. (2) Clothing and footwear appropriate for expected conditions. (3) Adequate food. (4) Some form of sleep system such as a [[sleeping bag]] and, perhaps, a foam pad. (5) [[Survival kit|Survival gear]]. \n\nA shelter appropriate to expected conditions is typically next. Practical items not already mentioned - cook kit, stove, container for water, a means of purifying it - are characteristically but not always taken in some form. Depending on the trip ready-to-eat foods may suffice and suitable water be found along the way. More [[ultralight backpacking|minimalist backpackers]] find ways to do with less.\n\nWeight is always critical. A rule of thumb suggests a fully loaded backpack should weigh no more than 25% of a person's weight. Every single item is scrutinized, many removed the first time a pack is hefted. Lightweight gear is widely available, which may or may not sacrifice utility and durability but will almost always cost more. A wide variety of items utilizing carbon fiber, lightweight alloys, specialty plastics, and impregnated fabrics are available.\n\n=== Water ===\n[[File:Canteen 0002.jpg|thumb|right|Military [[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]] with nested canteen cup and cover]]\n{{see also|wilderness diarrhea|portable water purification|solar water disinfection}}\n\nProper [[Dehydration|hydration]] is critical to successful backpacking. Depending on conditions - which include weather, terrain, load, and the hiker's age and fitness - a backpacker needs anywhere from 1/2 to 2 gallons (2 to 8 liters), or more, per day. At {{convert|1|kg|lb}} per {{convert|1|L|USqt}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://extoxnet.orst.edu/tibs/partperm.htm |title=Comparisons and Conversions |pages=2nd paragraph |access-date=2009-05-08}}</ref> water is exceptionally heavy.  It is impossible to carry more than a few days' supply.  Thus provisions for adequate water on a backpacking trip must be made in advance, which generally means filtering or purifying natural water supplies.\n\nEven in most seemingly pristine areas water needs treatment before consumption to protect against [[waterborne diseases]] carried by [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]]. The chief treatment methods include:\n* Boiling over fire, stove, or other heat source\n* Treatment with chemicals such as chlorine or iodine\n* Filtering (often used in conjunction with chemical treatments)\n* Treatment with [[ultraviolet]] light\n\nWater may be stored in appropriate bottles or collapsible plastic bladders.  [[Hydration pack]]s are increasingly popular.\n\n===Food===\n[[File:OatcakesTrangia.JPG|thumb|Baking oatcakes on a gas-fueled backpacking stove]]\n{{Main|Camping food}}\n{{See also|Nutrition |Outdoor cooking |Survival skills}}\n\nBackpacking is energy intensive.  It is essential enough food is taken to maintain both energy and health.  As with gear, weight is critical.  Consequently, items with high [[food energy]], long [[shelf life]], and low mass and volume deliver the most utility.  ''Satisfaction'' is another consideration, of greater or lesser importance to all hikers.  Only they can decide whether it's worth the effort (and trade-off against other gear) to carry fresh, heavy, or luxury food items.  The shorter the trip and easier the conditions the more feasible such treats become.\n\nIn all cases, both kit and fuel necessary to prepare and serve foodstuffs selected is part of the equation. Small liquid and gas fueled [[portable stove|campstoves]] and ultralight cooking pots are the norm. Increasingly campfires are prohibited.\n[[File:CampCooking.jpg|thumb|left|Cooking in the outdoors using a heated stone]]\n\nWhile most backpackers consume at least some specially prepared foods, many mainly rely on ordinary low moisture household items, such as cold cereal, oatmeal, powdered milk, cheese, crackers, sausage, salami, dried fruit, peanut butter, pasta, rice, and commercially packaged dinner entrees. Popular snacks include [[trail mix]], easily prepared at home; nuts, [[energy bar]]s, chocolate, and other forms of candy for quick energy and satisfaction. [[Jerky (food)|Jerky]] and [[pemmican]] are high-energy and lightweight. Coffee, tea, and cocoa are common beverages.\n\nDomestic items are typically repackaged in zippered plastic bags. Canned or jarred food, except for meats or small delicacies, is avoided: their containers and moist contents are usually heavy, and the metal or glass must be packed out. Food dehydrators are popular for drying fruit, jerky, and pre-cooked meals.\n\nMany hikers use [[freeze-drying|freeze-dried]] precooked entrees for hot meals, quickly reconstituted by adding boiling water. An alternative is [[ultra-high-temperature processing|Ultra High Temperature (UHT) processed]] food, which has its moisture retained and merely needs heating with a special, water-activated [[Flameless ration heater|chemical reaction]].\n[[File:MRE 20071124.PNG|thumb|Two [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MRE]] packets: beef teriyaki and meatloaf with gravy]]\n\nThese have roots in the U.S. military's [[MRE]], and eliminate the need for a stove, fuel, and water.  Against this, they are heavy, the water is already in the food, and they require their own fuel.  Still, they have some attractions.  They:\n* Do not need to be rehydrated or heated, useful where flames are prohibited and water is scarce.\n* Are very durably packaged\n* Contain a full meal complete with snack and dessert in every package\n* Offer a great deal of variety in each meal, including condiments\n* Individually package their components, allowing some to be stored accessibly and eaten on the move\n\nMREs can be difficult to find in retail stores, though a good selection is often available in a (U.S.) military surplus store.\n\nSpecialized cookbooks are available on trailside food and the challenges inherent in making it. Some focus on planning meals and preparing ingredients for short trips. Others on the challenges of organizing and preparing meals revolving around the bulk rationing prevalent in extended trail hikes, particularly those with pre-planned food drops.\n\n== Skills and safety ==\n[[File:Bear resistant food storage canister 2.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A bear-resistant food storage canister]]\n[[File:Footpath in Zerfenti - at the back Rufa'el church.jpg|thumb|Trekking route '''14''' in [[Zerfenti]] (Ethiopia)]]\n{{main|Hazards of outdoor recreation}}\n\n* [[Survival skills]] can provide peace of mind and may make the difference between life and death when the weather, terrain, or environment turns unexpectedly for the worse.\n* [[Navigation]] and [[orienteering]] are useful to find the [[trailhead]], then find and follow a route to a desired sequence of destinations, and then an exit.  In case of disorientation, orienteering skills are important to determine the current location and formulate a route to somewhere more desirable.  At their most basic, navigation skills allow one to choose the correct sequence of trails to follow. In situations where a trail or clear line-of-sight to the desired destination is not present, navigation and orienteering allow the backpacker to understand the terrain and wilderness around them and, using their tools and practices, select the appropriate direction to hike. Weather (rain, fog, snow), terrain (hilly, rock faces, dense forest), and hiker experience can all impact and increase the challenges to navigation in the wilderness.\n* [[First aid]]:  effectively dealing with minor injuries ([[wikt:splinter|splinter]]s, punctures, sprains) is considered by many a fundamental backcountry skill.  More subtle, but maybe even more important, is recognizing and promptly treating [[hypothermia]], [[heat stroke]], [[dehydration]] and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], as these are rarely encountered in daily life.\n* [[Leave No Trace]] is the backpacker's version of the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|golden rule]]:  To have beautiful and pristine places to enjoy, help make them.  At a minimum, don't make them worse.\n* [[Distress signal]]ing is a skill of last resort.\n\n== Related activities ==\n\n=== Winter backpacking===\n[[Image:Bivouac2.jpg|thumb|A winter [[bivouac sack|bivouac]] in Germany.]]\nWinter backpacking requires a higher level of skill and generally more specialized gear than in other seasons. [[Skis]] or [[snowshoes]] may be required to traverse deep snow, or [[crampons]] and an [[ice axe]] where needed. Winter sleeping bags and tents are essential, as are waterproof, water-repellent, and moisture dissipating materials. Cotton clothing retains moisture and chills the body, both particularly dangerous in cold weather.  Winter backpackers stick to wool or synthetic fabric like nylon or polypropylene, which hold less moisture and often have specialized wicking properties to dissipate sweat generated during aerobic activities. Layering is essential, as wet clothes quickly sap body heat and can lead to [[frostbite]] or [[hypothermia]].\n\nA winter bivouac can also be made in a [[snow cave]]. It has thermal properties similar to an [[igloo]] and is effective both at providing protection from wind and low temperatures.  A properly made snow cave can be 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) or warmer inside, even when outside temperatures are \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alpharubicon.com/primitive/quinzeetrigger.html |title=Quinzee (aka - Snow Cave) |publisher=AlphaRubicon.com |access-date=2007-01-30}}</ref><ref name=\"rage\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.etisurvival.com/snocv.htm |title=When Storms Rage (or how to build a snow cave) |last=Gerke |first=Randy |publisher=Enviro-Tech International |access-date=2007-01-30}}</ref>\nIt is constructed by excavating snow so that its entrance tunnel is below the main space in order to retain warm air.

Auckland: Oxford University Press, 1999.</ref> [[Hill walking]] is an equivalent in Britain (but this can also refer to a day walk), though backpackers make use of all kinds of accommodation, in addition to camping. Backpackers use simple huts in South Africa.<ref name=\"footprint.co.za\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.footprint.co.za/Development_introduction.htm |title=Trail Development}}</ref> '''Trekking''' and [[bushwalking]] are other word used to describe such multi-day trips.\n\nBackpacking [[backpacking (travel)|as a method of travel]] is a different activity, which mainly uses [[public transport]] during a journey which can last months.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Mountain Jack and a Wandering Miner .jpg|thumb|A backpacker during the [[California Gold Rush]]]]\nBackpacking is an [[outdoor recreation]] where gear is carried in a [[backpack]]. This can include food, water, bedding, shelter, clothing, stove, and cooking kit. Weight is necessarily key. Backpacking trips range from one night to weeks or months, sometimes aided by planned resupply points or drops.\n\n==Accommodations==\n[[File:Pocosin cabin.jpg|thumb|The Pocosin cabin along the [[Appalachian trail]] in [[Shenandoah National Park]] ]]\nBackpacking camps are usually more spartan than campsites where gear is transported by car or boat. In areas with heavy backpacker traffic, a hike-in campsite might have a [[fire ring]] (where permissible), an [[outhouse]], a wooden bulletin board with a [[map]] and information about the trail and area. Many hike-in camps are no more than level patches of ground free of underbrush. In remote [[wilderness]] areas hikers must choose their own site. Established camps are rare and the ethos is to \"leave no trace\" when gone.\n\n\nIn some regions, varying forms of accommodation exist, from simple log lean-to's to staffed facilities offering escalating degrees of service. Beds, meals, and even drinks may be had at [[Alps|Alpine]] [[mountain hut|hut]]s scattered among well-traveled European mountains. Backpackers there can walk from hut-to-hut without leaving the mountains, while in places like the [[Lake District]] or [[Yorkshire Dales]] in England hill-walkers descend to stay in [[Youth hostel]]s, farmhouses or [[guest house]]s.\n\nIn the more remote parts of Great Britain, especially Scotland, [[bothy|bothies]] exist to provide simple (free) accommodation for backpackers. On the French system of [[long distance trail]]s, ''[[Grande Randonn\u00e9e]]''s, backpackers can stay in ''g\u00eetes d'etapes'', which are simple hostels provided for walkers and cyclists. There are some simple shelters and occasional mountain hut also provided in North America, including on the [[Appalachian trail]]. Another example is the High Sierra Camps in the [[Yosemite National Park]]. Long distance backpacking trails with huts also exist in South Africa, including the 100&nbsp;km plus [[Amatola Trail]], in the [[Eastern Cape]] Province.<ref name=\"footprint.co.za\" /> Backpacking (trekking) is also popular in the [[Himalayas]], where [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] and [[pack animals]] are often used. <ref>{{Cite book |last=Zurick, Pacheco |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S20hk99x_-MC |title=Illustrated Atlas of the Himalaya |last2=J.Shrestha |last3=Bajracharya, B. |publisher=India Research Press |year=2006 |isbn=9788183860376}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n== Equipment ==\n[[File:Tent at High Shelf Camp.jpg|thumb|A backpacker's modern lightweight dome tent near [[Mount Anne]] in a [[Tasmanian Wilderness]] area]]\n{{main|Hiking equipment}}{{Further|Outdoor equipment}}\nBackpacking gear begins with (1) a suitable [[backpack]], proper both in size and fit. Backpacks in general fall into one of four categories: frameless, external frame, internal frame, and bodypack. (2) Clothing and footwear appropriate for expected conditions. (3) Adequate food. (4) Some form of sleep system such as a [[sleeping bag]] and, perhaps, a foam pad. (5) [[Survival kit|Survival gear]]. \n\nA shelter appropriate to expected conditions is typically next. Practical items not already mentioned - cook kit, stove, container for water, a means of purifying it - are characteristically but not always taken in some form. Depending on the trip ready-to-eat foods may suffice and suitable water be found along the way. More [[ultralight backpacking|minimalist backpackers]] find ways to do with less.\n\nWeight is always critical. A rule of thumb suggests a fully loaded backpack should weigh no more than 25% of a person's weight. Every single item is scrutinized, many removed the first time a pack is hefted. Lightweight gear is widely available, which may or may not sacrifice utility and durability but will almost always cost more. A wide variety of items utilizing carbon fiber, lightweight alloys, specialty plastics, and impregnated fabrics are available.\n\n=== Water ===\n[[File:Canteen 0002.jpg|thumb|right|Military [[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]] with nested canteen cup and cover]]\n{{see also|wilderness diarrhea|portable water purification|solar water disinfection}}\n\nProper [[Dehydration|hydration]] is critical to successful backpacking. Depending on conditions - which include weather, terrain, load, and the hiker's age and fitness - a backpacker needs anywhere from 1/2 to 2 gallons (2 to 8 liters), or more, per day. At {{convert|1|kg|lb}} per {{convert|1|L|USqt}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://extoxnet.orst.edu/tibs/partperm.htm |title=Comparisons and Conversions |pages=2nd paragraph |access-date=2009-05-08}}</ref> water is exceptionally heavy.  It is impossible to carry more than a few days' supply.  Thus provisions for adequate water on a backpacking trip must be made in advance, which generally means filtering or purifying natural water supplies.\n\nEven in most seemingly pristine areas water needs treatment before consumption to protect against [[waterborne diseases]] carried by [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]]. The chief treatment methods include:\n* Boiling over fire, stove, or other heat source\n* Treatment with chemicals such as chlorine or iodine\n* Filtering (often used in conjunction with chemical treatments)\n* Treatment with [[ultraviolet]] light\n\nWater may be stored in appropriate bottles or collapsible plastic bladders.  [[Hydration pack]]s are increasingly popular.\n\n===Food===\n[[File:OatcakesTrangia.JPG|thumb|Baking oatcakes on a gas-fueled backpacking stove]]\n{{Main|Camping food}}\n{{See also|Nutrition |Outdoor cooking |Survival skills}}\n\nBackpacking is energy intensive.  It is essential enough food is taken to maintain both energy and health.  As with gear, weight is critical.  Consequently, items with high [[food energy]], long [[shelf life]], and low mass and volume deliver the most utility.  ''Satisfaction'' is another consideration, of greater or lesser importance to all hikers.  Only they can decide whether it's worth the effort (and trade-off against other gear) to carry fresh, heavy, or luxury food items.  The shorter the trip and easier the conditions the more feasible such treats become.\n\nIn all cases, both kit and fuel necessary to prepare and serve foodstuffs selected is part of the equation. Small liquid and gas fueled [[portable stove|campstoves]] and ultralight cooking pots are the norm. Increasingly campfires are prohibited.\n[[File:CampCooking.jpg|thumb|left|Cooking in the outdoors using a heated stone]]\n\nWhile most backpackers consume at least some specially prepared foods, many mainly rely on ordinary low moisture household items, such as cold cereal, oatmeal, powdered milk, cheese, crackers, sausage, salami, dried fruit, peanut butter, pasta, rice, and commercially packaged dinner entrees. Popular snacks include [[trail mix]], easily prepared at home; nuts, [[energy bar]]s, chocolate, and other forms of candy for quick energy and satisfaction. [[Jerky (food)|Jerky]] and [[pemmican]] are high-energy and lightweight. Coffee, tea, and cocoa are common beverages.\n\nDomestic items are typically repackaged in zippered plastic bags. Canned or jarred food, except for meats or small delicacies, is avoided: their containers and moist contents are usually heavy, and the metal or glass must be packed out. Food dehydrators are popular for drying fruit, jerky, and pre-cooked meals.\n\nMany hikers use [[freeze-drying|freeze-dried]] precooked entrees for hot meals, quickly reconstituted by adding boiling water.

Scabies formed a one-off band called \"Les Punks\" for a late 1978 gig: Les Punks was a quasi-reunion of The Damned (without Brian James or Lu) that featured Scabies, Vanian, Sensible and bassist [[Lemmy]] of [[Hawkwind]] and [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]. The Damned tentatively reformed with the \"Les Punks\" line-up in early 1979, but originally performed as \"The Doomed\" to avoid potential trademark problems. Captain Sensible switched to guitar and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s, and after a brief period with Lemmy on bass for studio demos and a handful of live appearances,<ref>see the notes for ''Smash It Up - The Anthology 1976\u20131987''</ref> and a slightly longer period with [[Henry Badowski]] on bass, the bassist position was filled by [[Algy Ward]], formerly of [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]]. During a December 1978 tour of Scotland, [[Gary Holton]] filled in for Vanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louderthanwar.com/gary-holton-actor-and-heavy-metal-kid-a-look-back-at-a-cult-figure/ |title=Gary Holton (RIP) A look back at a cult figure |website=Louderthanwar.com |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe band officially went by The Damned again, playing their first gig under that name in April 1979, and signing a deal with [[Chiswick Records]]. They went back to the studio and released the charting singles, \"[[Love Song (The Damned song)|Love Song]]\" and \"[[Smash It Up]]\", followed by 1979's ''[[Machine Gun Etiquette]]'', and then a cover of [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s \"[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]\".<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17625/damned/|title=DAMNED &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com|accessdate=24 July 2019}}</ref> Vanian's vocals had by now expanded from the high-[[baritone]] of the early records to a smoother [[crooning]] style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kemptown.co.uk/freerad/captain/sensible.htm |title=Sensible - Crooner Vanian |website=Kemptown.co.uk |date= |accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> \n\n''Machine Gun Etiquette'' featured a strong 1960s [[garage rock]] influence, with [[Farfisa]] organ in several songs.

Other hits from the same album were \"[[The Shadow of Love]]\" with its gloomy gothic sound, and the lighter \"[[Is It A Dream?]]\".{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn January 1986, the non-album single \"[[Eloise (Paul Ryan song)|Eloise]]\", a cover of a 1968 hit by [[Barry Ryan (singer)|Barry Ryan]], was a No.&nbsp;3 chart success in the UK, the group's highest chart placing to date.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nHowever, ''Phantasmagoria'''s November 1986 follow-up, ''[[Anything (The Damned album)|Anything]]'', was a commercial failure, although MCA did include one of its tracks (\"[[In Dulce Decorum]]\") on the soundtrack release of ''[[Miami Vice]] II''. The cover of [[Love (band)|Love]]'s \"[[Alone Again Or]]\" was also released as a single.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nLate in 1987 The Damned began to work on a new album for MCA, but the result of these sessions remain unreleased as the record contract was dissolved. Two of the new songs (\"Gunning for Love\" and \"The Loveless and The Damned\") were later re-recorded by the [[Dave Vanian and the Phantom Chords]] side project. \n=== Final Damnation Tour (1988-89) === \nJames and Sensible rejoined the group temporarily for a few live appearances including a concert at the London Town and Country Club in June 1988 which was released the following year as ''[[Final Damnation]] \u2013 The Damned Reunion Concert''. Following a farewell concert at London's Brixton Academy supported by The Milk Monitors, Horse, and [[Claytown Troupe]], the band disbanded again.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nDuring this era, the only comprehensive book about The Damned was released: ''The Book of The Damned, The Light At the End of the Tunnel, The Official Biography'', by Carol Clerk (Omnibus Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-7119-1122-3}}).\n\n===Second and third reformations (1990\u20131995)===\nAlthough officially on hiatus, the group issued two singles in 1990. The first, \"Fun Factory\", was a song recorded in 1982 by the Sensible/Vanian/Scabies/Gray line-up; intended for single release at the time, the bankruptcy of their record company prevented the issue of the record for 9 years. The year's second single, \"Prokofiev\", was recorded by Scabies, Vanian and Brian James, and was sold on a 1991 reunion tour of the US.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1993 the group reformed again with a new line-up featuring Scabies, Vanian, guitarists Kris Dollimore (formerly of [[The Godfathers]]), Alan Lee Shaw, and bassist [[Moose Harris]] (formerly of [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]]). Around this time, two prominent modern rock groups each covered a Damned song: [[Guns N' Roses]] recorded \"New Rose\" for their ''[[\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"]]'' (1993), while [[The Offspring]] covered \"[[Smash It Up]]\" for the ''[[Batman Forever]]'' [[soundtrack]] (1995). Both cover versions enjoyed major label distribution and created more exposure to the Damned sound, sometimes to a younger audience unfamiliar with the group.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe reformed Damned toured regularly for about two years and released a new full-length album, ''[[Not of This Earth (The Damned album)|Not of This Earth]]'' in late 1995. Promoted with a series of long tours prior to its release, by the time the album was released The Damned had yet again split, partly as the result of legal battles: Vanian and Sensible accused Scabies of releasing ''Not of This Earth'' without proper authorization.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Return of Captain Sensible and new lineup (1996\u20132003)===\nSensible rejoined Vanian in 1996 and yet another formation of The Damned appeared. This initially featured bassist [[Paul Gray (English musician)|Paul Gray]], who was later replaced by [[Patricia Morrison]], previously of [[Bags (Los Angeles band)|Bags]], [[The Gun Club]] and [[The Sisters of Mercy]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nBy 2000, The Damned consisted of Vanian, Sensible, Morrison and new recruits [[Monty Oxymoron]] on keyboards and Andy (Pinch) Pinching, a founding member of [[English Dogs]], on drums. Garrie Dreadful, another recruit from Sensible's solo band, played drums from 1997 to 1999 then gave way to Pinch. In 2001, the band released the album [[Grave Disorder]], on [[Dexter Holland]]'s Nitro Records label and promoted it with continual touring. A spring tour of the United States was planned in 2002 supporting [[Rob Zombie]]. However, the band dropped off after a few shows with Captain Sensible saying, \"gothic punk was completely lost on the predominantly [[Heavy metal music|metal]] crowds\".

Scabies formed a one-off band called \"Les Punks\" for a late 1978 gig: Les Punks was a quasi-reunion of The Damned (without Brian James or Lu) that featured Scabies, Vanian, Sensible and bassist [[Lemmy]] of [[Hawkwind]] and [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]. The Damned tentatively reformed with the \"Les Punks\" line-up in early 1979, but originally performed as \"The Doomed\" to avoid potential trademark problems. Captain Sensible switched to guitar and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s, and after a brief period with Lemmy on bass for studio demos and a handful of live appearances,<ref>see the notes for ''Smash It Up - The Anthology 1976\u20131987''</ref> and a slightly longer period with [[Henry Badowski]] on bass, the bassist position was filled by [[Algy Ward]], formerly of [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]]. During a December 1978 tour of Scotland, [[Gary Holton]] filled in for Vanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louderthanwar.com/gary-holton-actor-and-heavy-metal-kid-a-look-back-at-a-cult-figure/ |title=Gary Holton (RIP) A look back at a cult figure |website=Louderthanwar.com |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe band officially went by The Damned again, playing their first gig under that name in April 1979, and signing a deal with [[Chiswick Records]]. They went back to the studio and released the charting singles, \"[[Love Song (The Damned song)|Love Song]]\" and \"[[Smash It Up]]\", followed by 1979's ''[[Machine Gun Etiquette]]'', and then a cover of [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s \"[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]\".<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17625/damned/|title=DAMNED &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com|accessdate=24 July 2019}}</ref> Vanian's vocals had by now expanded from the high-[[baritone]] of the early records to a smoother [[crooning]] style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kemptown.co.uk/freerad/captain/sensible.htm |title=Sensible - Crooner Vanian |website=Kemptown.co.uk |date= |accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> \n\n''Machine Gun Etiquette'' featured a strong 1960s [[garage rock]] influence, with [[Farfisa]] organ in several songs.

At this time, Sensible was splitting his time between The Damned and his own solo career, which had seen success in the UK with the number one hit \"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\" in 1982.

The Damned signed a contract with major label [[MCA Records|MCA]], and the ''[[Phantasmagoria (The Damned album)|Phantasmagoria]]'' album followed in July 1985, preceded by the UK No.&nbsp;21 single \"[[Grimly Fiendish]]\". Other hits from the same album were \"[[The Shadow of Love]]\" with its gloomy gothic sound, and the lighter \"[[Is It A Dream?]]\".{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn January 1986, the non-album single \"[[Eloise (Paul Ryan song)|Eloise]]\", a cover of a 1968 hit by [[Barry Ryan (singer)|Barry Ryan]], was a No.&nbsp;3 chart success in the UK, the group's highest chart placing to date.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nHowever, ''Phantasmagoria'''s November 1986 follow-up, ''[[Anything (The Damned album)|Anything]]'', was a commercial failure, although MCA did include one of its tracks (\"[[In Dulce Decorum]]\") on the soundtrack release of ''[[Miami Vice]] II''. The cover of [[Love (band)|Love]]'s \"[[Alone Again Or]]\" was also released as a single.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nLate in 1987 The Damned began to work on a new album for MCA, but the result of these sessions remain unreleased as the record contract was dissolved. Two of the new songs (\"Gunning for Love\" and \"The Loveless and The Damned\") were later re-recorded by the [[Dave Vanian and the Phantom Chords]] side project. \n=== Final Damnation Tour (1988-89) === \nJames and Sensible rejoined the group temporarily for a few live appearances including a concert at the London Town and Country Club in June 1988 which was released the following year as ''[[Final Damnation]] \u2013 The Damned Reunion Concert''. Following a farewell concert at London's Brixton Academy supported by The Milk Monitors, Horse, and [[Claytown Troupe]], the band disbanded again.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nDuring this era, the only comprehensive book about The Damned was released: ''The Book of The Damned, The Light At the End of the Tunnel, The Official Biography'', by Carol Clerk (Omnibus Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-7119-1122-3}}).\n\n===Second and third reformations (1990\u20131995)===\nAlthough officially on hiatus, the group issued two singles in 1990. The first, \"Fun Factory\", was a song recorded in 1982 by the Sensible/Vanian/Scabies/Gray line-up; intended for single release at the time, the bankruptcy of their record company prevented the issue of the record for 9 years. The year's second single, \"Prokofiev\", was recorded by Scabies, Vanian and Brian James, and was sold on a 1991 reunion tour of the US.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1993 the group reformed again with a new line-up featuring Scabies, Vanian, guitarists Kris Dollimore (formerly of [[The Godfathers]]), Alan Lee Shaw, and bassist [[Moose Harris]] (formerly of [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]]). Around this time, two prominent modern rock groups each covered a Damned song: [[Guns N' Roses]] recorded \"New Rose\" for their ''[[\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"]]'' (1993), while [[The Offspring]] covered \"[[Smash It Up]]\" for the ''[[Batman Forever]]'' [[soundtrack]] (1995). Both cover versions enjoyed major label distribution and created more exposure to the Damned sound, sometimes to a younger audience unfamiliar with the group.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe reformed Damned toured regularly for about two years and released a new full-length album, ''[[Not of This Earth (The Damned album)|Not of This Earth]]'' in late 1995. Promoted with a series of long tours prior to its release, by the time the album was released The Damned had yet again split, partly as the result of legal battles: Vanian and Sensible accused Scabies of releasing ''Not of This Earth'' without proper authorization.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Return of Captain Sensible and new lineup (1996\u20132003)===\nSensible rejoined Vanian in 1996 and yet another formation of The Damned appeared. This initially featured bassist [[Paul Gray (English musician)|Paul Gray]], who was later replaced by [[Patricia Morrison]], previously of [[Bags (Los Angeles band)|Bags]], [[The Gun Club]] and [[The Sisters of Mercy]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nBy 2000, The Damned consisted of Vanian, Sensible, Morrison and new recruits [[Monty Oxymoron]] on keyboards and Andy (Pinch) Pinching, a founding member of [[English Dogs]], on drums. Garrie Dreadful, another recruit from Sensible's solo band, played drums from 1997 to 1999 then gave way to Pinch. In 2001, the band released the album [[Grave Disorder]], on [[Dexter Holland]]'s Nitro Records label and promoted it with continual touring. A spring tour of the United States was planned in 2002 supporting [[Rob Zombie]]. However, the band dropped off after a few shows with Captain Sensible saying, \"gothic punk was completely lost on the predominantly [[Heavy metal music|metal]] crowds\".

Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 2481</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.\n\n==Sports==\nThe city is a stronghold for basketball as traditionally, roughly half of the teams of [[Rwanda's National Basketball League]] are based there, including 2016 Champion [[Patriots BBC]], record holding Champion [[Espoir BBC]] and others, including APR  basketball club, IPRC-Kigali and Cercle Sportif de Kigali (CSK).<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/201603250258.html Rwanda: Basketball League - Espoir Wary of IPRC-Kigali] Bishumba, Richard, All Africa. 25 March 2016, retrieved 16 October 2016.</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Kigali City Transport inside the City.jpg|thumb|right|Kigali Transport]]\n[[File:TaxiBusesKigali.jpg|thumb|A row of Taxi minibuses waiting to depart in Kigali, Rwanda]]\nThe city has an [[international airport]], [[Kigali International Airport]].<ref>Britannica,\n[https://www.britannica.com/place/Kigali Kigali], britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 30, 2019</ref>\nThe airport is somewhat limited by its location on the top of a hill, and a brand new one is currently being built in the [[Nyamata]] area, some {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Kigali.\n\nThere are several daily coach services which depart from Kigali to destinations in East Africa. Most leave from the Nyabugogo bus station. These services include:\n* Modern Coast, a [[Kenya]]n coach and courier service which connects [[Gisenyi]]/[[Goma]] through [[Kyanika]] and Kigali through [[Gatuna]] to [[Kampala]] and [[Nairobi]]. It offers online booking and payment, three seat classes and in some busses personal TVs and 240 V/USB sockets.\n* Jaguar Executive Coaches, which connects Kigali to [[Kampala]], the [[Uganda]]n capital, via [[Gatuna]] or via [[Kayonza]] and [[Kagitumba]].\n* Yahoo Car Express \u2013 A minibus service running between Kigali and [[Bujumbura]] in [[Burundi]].\n* Kampala Coach Ltd, which runs services to Kampala (8 hours), Nairobi in Kenya (24 hours), Dar es Salaam in Tanzania (36 hours) and Mombasa in Kenya (32 hours).\n\nKigali is the hub of the Rwanda transport network, with 15 minutes express bus routes to all major towns in the country. There are also taxi minibus services ([[matatu]]s) leaving from Kigali, which also go through to the major towns, but some of them stop frequently along the route to pick people up or drop them off.\n\nPublic transport within Kigali is shifting from using small matatus to bigger city buses, which are connecting the most important sectors. These buses use a cash-free payment system called [[Tap&Go]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.igihe.com/news/ac-group-launches-tap-go-smart-payment-solution.html|title=AC Group launches Tap&Go smart payment solution for public transport|website=en.igihe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref> In 2017, matatus were still used to connect the more remote areas of the city. In contrast to the national express buses, these services wait to fill up before setting off from the terminus, then pick up and drop off frequently en route.\n\nKigali has many taxis (known as 'special hire' or 'taxi voiture'), which are generally painted white with an orange stripe down the side. Even more popular are motorbike taxis ('taxi moto'), which offer a service similar to a taxi, but for lower prices, typically in the range 300-1000 [[Rwanda franc|FRW]].\n\n==Future==\nUnder a master plan for 2040, Kigali will be decentralised, with business, shopping, and leisure districts, and suburbs. The plan calls for skyscrapers, arching pedestrian walkways and [[Urban open space|green spaces]] to be built, alongside amenities such as fountains and a wetlands conservation area. In addition, there will be an effective public transportation network. However, among the most pressing problems is affordable housing for the majority of the city's population, and a number of schemes are under consideration. The city's population of about 1.2 million is expected to triple by that time.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/kigali-plan-rwandan-city-afford-new-homes-offices | title=Kigali's future or costly fantasy?

The city hosts the main residence and offices of the [[President of Rwanda]] and government ministries. The city is within the [[Provinces of Rwanda|province]] of Kigali City, which was enlarged in January 2006, as part of local government reorganisation in the country. Kigali's city limits cover the whole province; it is consolidated.

Most leave from the Nyabugogo bus station. These services include:\n* Modern Coast, a [[Kenya]]n coach and courier service which connects [[Gisenyi]]/[[Goma]] through [[Kyanika]] and Kigali through [[Gatuna]] to [[Kampala]] and [[Nairobi]]. It offers online booking and payment, three seat classes and in some busses personal TVs and 240 V/USB sockets.\n* Jaguar Executive Coaches, which connects Kigali to [[Kampala]], the [[Uganda]]n capital, via [[Gatuna]] or via [[Kayonza]] and [[Kagitumba]].\n* Yahoo Car Express \u2013 A minibus service running between Kigali and [[Bujumbura]] in [[Burundi]].\n* Kampala Coach Ltd, which runs services to Kampala (8 hours), Nairobi in Kenya (24 hours), Dar es Salaam in Tanzania (36 hours) and Mombasa in Kenya (32 hours).\n\nKigali is the hub of the Rwanda transport network, with 15 minutes express bus routes to all major towns in the country. There are also taxi minibus services ([[matatu]]s) leaving from Kigali, which also go through to the major towns, but some of them stop frequently along the route to pick people up or drop them off.\n\nPublic transport within Kigali is shifting from using small matatus to bigger city buses, which are connecting the most important sectors. These buses use a cash-free payment system called [[Tap&Go]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.igihe.com/news/ac-group-launches-tap-go-smart-payment-solution.html|title=AC Group launches Tap&Go smart payment solution for public transport|website=en.igihe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref> In 2017, matatus were still used to connect the more remote areas of the city. In contrast to the national express buses, these services wait to fill up before setting off from the terminus, then pick up and drop off frequently en route.\n\nKigali has many taxis (known as 'special hire' or 'taxi voiture'), which are generally painted white with an orange stripe down the side. Even more popular are motorbike taxis ('taxi moto'), which offer a service similar to a taxi, but for lower prices, typically in the range 300-1000 [[Rwanda franc|FRW]].\n\n==Future==\nUnder a master plan for 2040, Kigali will be decentralised, with business, shopping, and leisure districts, and suburbs. The plan calls for skyscrapers, arching pedestrian walkways and [[Urban open space|green spaces]] to be built, alongside amenities such as fountains and a wetlands conservation area. In addition, there will be an effective public transportation network. However, among the most pressing problems is affordable housing for the majority of the city's population, and a number of schemes are under consideration. The city's population of about 1.2 million is expected to triple by that time.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/kigali-plan-rwandan-city-afford-new-homes-offices | title=Kigali's future or costly fantasy?
