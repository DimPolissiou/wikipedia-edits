Later, Wilson earned a Master of Science degree from [[Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University]] (1985), graduated from the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]], the [[Armed Forces Staff College]] (now the Joint Forces Staff College), the [[Air War College]], and was the 1997 National Defense [[Fellow]] and author of ''Strategic & Tactical Air Reconnaissance in the Near East.''{{r|Potomac Local (2019)}}{{r|Wilson (2012)}}{{r|Embry-Riddle (2019)}}\n\n== Military career ==\n[[File:Charles Wilson pilot of KC-135Q.jpg |left|thumb|Wilson at the controls of a KC{{nbh}}135Q Stratotanker]]\nDuring his freshman year at Indiana University, Wilson, entered the [[Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (AFROTC) as a pilot candidate and completed the Air Force flight instruction program with a [[private pilot license]]. With the drawdown of US forces in Vietnam, Air Force pilot production was minimized with AFROTC pilot candidate slots for active duty virtually eliminated.{{r|F-4 Society (2001)}} Instead, Wilson was commissioned a [[Second lieutenant#United_States|second lieutenant]], and in 1977, received orders to [[Port Austin Air Force Station]] in Michigan where he was posted as the chief of administration and personnel.{{r| Wilson DOS Bio (2004)}}\n\nIn 1980, Wilson was selected as commander of the 6510th Air Base Group (ABG) Headquarters Squadron, responsible for base services including personnel, public affairs, and security,{{r|AFFTC (1962)}} where he achieved the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]]'s \"Executive Officer of the Year\" award.

The [[center of excellence]] was renamed as the [[Air Force Command and Control Training and Innovation Group]] (AFC2TIG) in April 1999 and renamed again in 2004 as the [[505th Command and Control Wing]].

With the drawdown of US forces in Vietnam, Air Force pilot production was minimized with AFROTC pilot candidate slots for active duty virtually eliminated.{{r|F-4 Society (2001)}} Instead, Wilson was commissioned a [[Second lieutenant#United_States|second lieutenant]], and in 1977, received orders to [[Port Austin Air Force Station]] in Michigan where he was posted as the chief of administration and personnel.{{r| Wilson DOS Bio (2004)}}\n\nIn 1980, Wilson was selected as commander of the 6510th Air Base Group (ABG) Headquarters Squadron, responsible for base services including personnel, public affairs, and security,{{r|AFFTC (1962)}} where he achieved the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]]'s \"Executive Officer of the Year\" award.

He served on many operational deployments in Europe, the Pacific, and Southwest Asia. Wilson advanced to [[flight instructor]] in the U-2 and in 1993 commanded the 4402nd Reconnaissance Squadron (Provisional), known as the ''Desert Dragons,'' at [[Taif Air Base]], Saudi Arabia.{{r| Wilson DOS Bio (2004)}}{{r|Jenkins (2012)|p=354}} A provisional squadron is one created for a limited time to accomplish a specific mission.{{r|Free Dictionary Provisional}} The 4402nd was formed to continue reconnaissance operations over Iraq after the end of the [[1991 Gulf War]] in order to ensure compliance with [[United Nations]] (UN) resolutions.{{r|Pocock (2005)|p=312}} U-2s from the 4402nd flew ''Olive Branch'' missions to provide imagery for the [[United Nations Special Commission]] (UNSCOM) that searched for evidence of Iraqi [[weapons of mass destruction]].{{r|Pocock (2005)|p=312}}{{r|Norris (2010)|p=178}} The Iraqi government did not approve of these [[Freedoms of the air#First_freedom|overflights]], and Wilson's first U-2 mission for the UN was targeted by Iraqi [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]]. The U-2s operating in-theater at this time had outdated defensive capabilities.

The [[center of excellence]] was renamed as the [[Air Force Command and Control Training and Innovation Group]] (AFC2TIG) in April 1999 and renamed again in 2004 as the [[505th Command and Control Wing]]. Wilson's organization re-engineered airpower [[command and control]] (C<sup>2</sup>) at the operational level of war.

At the [[2008 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], he benefited from [[Graeme Dott]]'s withdrawal before defeating [[Joe Perry (snooker player)|Joe Perry]] 5\u20132 in the last 16, despite Perry feeling that he had outplayed Trump, who himself admitted to not having played well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/royal_london_watches_grand_prix_news-8321.htm?tid=113|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305234408/http://www.worldsnooker.com/royal_london_watches_grand_prix_news-8321.htm?tid=113|url-status=dead|title=Top Trump|archivedate=5 March 2012}}</ref> Then came the biggest win of his career so far, when he defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan 5\u20134 to reach the semi-final, in which he was himself defeated 4\u20136 by [[John Higgins]].

He again failed to reach the main stage of the World Championship, losing 8\u201310 to [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]] in the final qualifying round, having led 6\u20133. Lee noted that Trump had not followed the custom of apologising for fluked shots during the match, and concluded \"all I've heard about for the last five years in my area is how good he is, and he is good .. but he's blown a 6\u20133 lead today and hopefully that will stick with him for a while yet.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=World Championship: final qualifying |magazine=Snooker Scene magazine |page=11 |publisher=Everton's News Agency |date=April 2009 }}</ref> Trump ended the season in the Top 32 of the rankings for the first time.
