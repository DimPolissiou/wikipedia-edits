Its primary significance is in advocating for a combined arms approach to warfare using five types of infantry and two type of support. Qi Jiguang separated infantry into five separate categories: firearms, swordsmen, archers with fire arrows, ordinary archers, and spearmen. He split support crews into horse archers and artillery units. The ''Jixiao Xinshu'' is also one of the earliest existing East Asian texts to address the relevance of [[Chinese martial arts]] with respect to military training and warfare. Several contemporary martial arts styles of Qi's era are mentioned in the book, including the staff method of the [[Shaolin temple]].\n\n==Background==\n\nIn the late 16th century the military of the Ming dynasty was in poor condition. As the [[Mongol]] forces of [[Altan Khan]] raided the northern frontier, China's coastline fell prey to ''[[wokou]]'' pirates, who were ostensibly Japanese in origin. Qi Jiguang was assigned to the defense of [[Zhejiang]] in 1555, where he created his own standards of military organization, equipment, tactics, training, and procedures.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|p=159}}</ref> He published his thoughts on military techniques, tactics, and strategies in the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' after achieving several victories in battle.\n\n==Contents==\n\nThere are two editions of the ''Jixiao Xinshu''. The first edition was written from 1560-1561 and consists of 18 chapters. It is known as the 18 chapter edition. The second edition, published in 1584 during Qi's forced retirement, included re-edited and new material compiled in 14 chapters. It is known as the 14 chapter edition.\n\nThe chapters included in the 18-chapter edition are as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|pp=16\u201318}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  \n! Chapter !!

Excluding the corporal and cook/porter, the ten remaining men could be split into two identical five-man squads. This was so that when Japanese pirates made it past the long lances, the saber-and-shield men formed a protective screen for the vulnerable lancers. In battle, the two saber-and-shield men had different roles. The one on the right would hold the advance position of the squad, while the one on the left was to throw javelins and lure the enemy closer. The two men with multiple tip spears would entangle the pirates while the lancers attacked them. The trident carriers guarded the flanks and rear.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=168\u2013169}}</ref>\n\n===Firearms===\nAfter suffering several defeats to pirates, Qi also made a recommendation for a concerted campaign to integrate musket teams into the army, based on their superior range and firepower compared to bows and arrows.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}} Qi became enamored with the musket after his defeats and became one of the primary proponents of their use in the Ming army. He favored it for its accuracy and its ability to penetrate armor.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}}\n\nIdeally an entire musket team would have 10 musketeers, but often had 4 or 2 in practice. The optimal musket formation that Qi proposed was a 12 man musket team similar to the melee mandarin duck formation. However, instead of fighting in a hand to hand formation, they operated on the principle of [[volley fire]], which Qi pioneered prior to the publication of the first edition of the ''Jixiao Xinshu''.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}} The teams could be arranged in a single line, formed two layers deep with five musketeers each, or five layers deep with two muskets per layer. Once the enemy was within range, each layer would fire in succession, and afterwards a unit armed with traditional close combat weapons would move forward ahead of the musketeers. The troops would then enter into melee combat with the enemy together. Alternatively, the musketeers could be placed behind wooden stockades or other fortifications, firing and reloading continuously by turns.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=174}}\n\nEach squad was drilled in coordinated and mutually-supportive combat scenarios with clearly defined roles. Because Qi's troops were recruited from peasant stock, and were not considered the equals of their Japanese foes, Qi Jiguang emphasized the use of combined arms and squad tactics. Units were rewarded or punished collectively: an officer was executed if his entire unit fled the enemy, and if a squad leader was killed in battle, the whole squad would be put to death.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=167\u2013169}}</ref>\n\n==Weapons production==\n\nThe standard procedure for the procurement of weapons for a commander such as Qi Jiguang was for production quotas to be assigned by provincial officials to each local district under the commander's responsibility. The resulting weapons produced under this system varied widely in quality. Muskets in particular exploded with alarming frequency, leading Qi to eschew reliance on firearms in favor of using melee tools such as swords, rattan shields, and sharpened bamboo poles.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=170\u2013171}}</ref> However, later in his career Qi became a strong proponent of integrating muskets after suffering several defeats to the pirates. Qi's reconsideration of firearms in warfare led to the creation of the first well drilled musket teams in China. Qi was also a pioneer of the musket volley fire technique, which would later be adopted throughout China and Korea. Included in the manual are several passages detailing the usage of muskets, the volley fire technique, and an estimation of the percentage of firearms that would likely fail to fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|p=172}}</ref>\n\nThe manual provides the following description of the forging of swords:\n\n{{cquote|\nThe following steps in the manufacturing process of the short sword are necessary:\n# The material of iron used must be forged many times (that is heated, hammered and folded numerous times).\n# The cutting edge must be made from the best steel, free of impurities.\n# The entire part of the blade where the back or ridge of the blade joins the cutting edge must be filed so that they appear seamlessly joined together. This process is necessary to enable the sword to cut well.}}\n\n==Unarmed fighting==\nThe last chapter of the ''Jixiao Xinshu'', the ''Quanjing Jieyao Pian'', covers the subject of unarmed combat. Qi Jiguang regarded unarmed fighting as being useless on the battlefield. However, he recognized its value as a form of basic training to strengthen his troops, improving their physical fitness and confidence.<ref>{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|p=33}}</ref> Qi selected thirty-two postures to illustrate, from among the martial arts of the period. The description of the techniques is written in verse, typically with seven characters per line.\n\nIn the chapter's introduction, Qi names sixteen different fighting styles, all of which he considered to have been handed down in an incomplete fashion, \"some missing the lower part, some missing the upper\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> Among the arts listed is the [[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolin staff method]], which was later documented in detail in [[Cheng Zongyou]]'s ''Exposition of the Original Shaolin Staff Method'', published around 1610.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> By contrast, Shaolin unarmed fighting techniques are not mentioned. The entire listing of late Ming dynasty martial arts was later copied without attribution by a manual of the Shaolin style, the ''Hand Combat Classic'' (''Quanjing quanfa beiyao''). However, the later manual, with a preface dated to 1784, altered the text, adding a spurious claim that the history of hand combat had originated at the Shaolin Monastery.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=116\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nQi's discussion of hand-to-hand combat makes no mention of a spiritual element to the martial arts, nor does it allude to breathing or [[qi]] circulation. By contrast, Chinese martial arts texts from the [[Manchu conquest of China|Ming-Qing transition]] onward represent a synthesis of functional martial arts techniques with [[Taoist|Daoist]] ''[[tao yin|daoyin]]'' health practices, breathing exercises, and meditation.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=148\u2013149}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lorge|2011|p=202}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nQi Jiguang was one of several Ming authors to document the military tactics and martial arts techniques of the era. The earliest known documentation of specific styles of [[Chinese martial arts]] were produced during the late Ming piracy crisis, as scholars and generals such as Qi and his contemporary [[Yu Dayou]] turned their attention to reversing the decline of the Ming military. In the late 16th century, the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)]] also spurred great interest in military training methods within the Korean government. Qi Jiguang's writings were of particular interest because of his successful campaigns against Japanese pirates several decades prior. The 14-chapter edition of the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' served as a model for the oldest known extant Korean military manual, the [[Muyejebo]], and was disseminated among Korean military thinkers.\n\nIn Japan both the 14 and 18 chapter editions were published several times, and some methods from the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' were transferred over to the ''Heiho Hidensho'' (Okugisho), a Japanese strategy book written by [[Yamamoto Kansuke (general)|Yamamoto Kansuke]] in the 16th century.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Mandarin Duck Formation layout.png|Layout of the 'mandarin duck formation.'\nFile:Second Power Formation.png|The 'second power formation' is a split 'mandarin duck squad.'\nFile:Lesser Third Power Formation.png|The 'lesser third power formation.'\nFile:Third Power Formation.png|The 'third power formation.'\nFile:Marching column.png|A marching column contained sixteen 'mandarin duck formations' divided into four platoons.

Its primary significance is in advocating for a combined arms approach to warfare using five types of infantry and two type of support. Qi Jiguang separated infantry into five separate categories: firearms, swordsmen, archers with fire arrows, ordinary archers, and spearmen. He split support crews into horse archers and artillery units. The ''Jixiao Xinshu'' is also one of the earliest existing East Asian texts to address the relevance of [[Chinese martial arts]] with respect to military training and warfare. Several contemporary martial arts styles of Qi's era are mentioned in the book, including the staff method of the [[Shaolin temple]].\n\n==Background==\n\nIn the late 16th century the military of the Ming dynasty was in poor condition. As the [[Mongol]] forces of [[Altan Khan]] raided the northern frontier, China's coastline fell prey to ''[[wokou]]'' pirates, who were ostensibly Japanese in origin. Qi Jiguang was assigned to the defense of [[Zhejiang]] in 1555, where he created his own standards of military organization, equipment, tactics, training, and procedures.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|p=159}}</ref> He published his thoughts on military techniques, tactics, and strategies in the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' after achieving several victories in battle.\n\n==Contents==\n\nThere are two editions of the ''Jixiao Xinshu''. The first edition was written from 1560-1561 and consists of 18 chapters. It is known as the 18 chapter edition. The second edition, published in 1584 during Qi's forced retirement, included re-edited and new material compiled in 14 chapters. It is known as the 14 chapter edition.\n\nThe chapters included in the 18-chapter edition are as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|pp=16\u201318}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  \n! Chapter !!

Excluding the corporal and cook/porter, the ten remaining men could be split into two identical five-man squads. This was so that when Japanese pirates made it past the long lances, the saber-and-shield men formed a protective screen for the vulnerable lancers. In battle, the two saber-and-shield men had different roles. The one on the right would hold the advance position of the squad, while the one on the left was to throw javelins and lure the enemy closer. The two men with multiple tip spears would entangle the pirates while the lancers attacked them. The trident carriers guarded the flanks and rear.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=168\u2013169}}</ref>\n\n===Firearms===\nAfter suffering several defeats to pirates, Qi also made a recommendation for a concerted campaign to integrate musket teams into the army, based on their superior range and firepower compared to bows and arrows.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}} Qi became enamored with the musket after his defeats and became one of the primary proponents of their use in the Ming army. He favored it for its accuracy and its ability to penetrate armor.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}}\n\nIdeally an entire musket team would have 10 musketeers, but often had 4 or 2 in practice. The optimal musket formation that Qi proposed was a 12 man musket team similar to the melee mandarin duck formation. However, instead of fighting in a hand to hand formation, they operated on the principle of [[volley fire]], which Qi pioneered prior to the publication of the first edition of the ''Jixiao Xinshu''.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}} The teams could be arranged in a single line, formed two layers deep with five musketeers each, or five layers deep with two muskets per layer. Once the enemy was within range, each layer would fire in succession, and afterwards a unit armed with traditional close combat weapons would move forward ahead of the musketeers. The troops would then enter into melee combat with the enemy together. Alternatively, the musketeers could be placed behind wooden stockades or other fortifications, firing and reloading continuously by turns.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=174}}\n\nEach squad was drilled in coordinated and mutually-supportive combat scenarios with clearly defined roles. Because Qi's troops were recruited from peasant stock, and were not considered the equals of their Japanese foes, Qi Jiguang emphasized the use of combined arms and squad tactics. Units were rewarded or punished collectively: an officer was executed if his entire unit fled the enemy, and if a squad leader was killed in battle, the whole squad would be put to death.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=167\u2013169}}</ref>\n\n==Weapons production==\n\nThe standard procedure for the procurement of weapons for a commander such as Qi Jiguang was for production quotas to be assigned by provincial officials to each local district under the commander's responsibility. The resulting weapons produced under this system varied widely in quality. Muskets in particular exploded with alarming frequency, leading Qi to eschew reliance on firearms in favor of using melee tools such as swords, rattan shields, and sharpened bamboo poles.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=170\u2013171}}</ref> However, later in his career Qi became a strong proponent of integrating muskets after suffering several defeats to the pirates. Qi's reconsideration of firearms in warfare led to the creation of the first well drilled musket teams in China. Qi was also a pioneer of the musket volley fire technique, which would later be adopted throughout China and Korea. Included in the manual are several passages detailing the usage of muskets, the volley fire technique, and an estimation of the percentage of firearms that would likely fail to fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|p=172}}</ref>\n\nThe manual provides the following description of the forging of swords:\n\n{{cquote|\nThe following steps in the manufacturing process of the short sword are necessary:\n# The material of iron used must be forged many times (that is heated, hammered and folded numerous times).\n# The cutting edge must be made from the best steel, free of impurities.\n# The entire part of the blade where the back or ridge of the blade joins the cutting edge must be filed so that they appear seamlessly joined together. This process is necessary to enable the sword to cut well.}}\n\n==Unarmed fighting==\nThe last chapter of the ''Jixiao Xinshu'', the ''Quanjing Jieyao Pian'', covers the subject of unarmed combat. Qi Jiguang regarded unarmed fighting as being useless on the battlefield. However, he recognized its value as a form of basic training to strengthen his troops, improving their physical fitness and confidence.<ref>{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|p=33}}</ref> Qi selected thirty-two postures to illustrate, from among the martial arts of the period. The description of the techniques is written in verse, typically with seven characters per line.\n\nIn the chapter's introduction, Qi names sixteen different fighting styles, all of which he considered to have been handed down in an incomplete fashion, \"some missing the lower part, some missing the upper\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> Among the arts listed is the [[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolin staff method]], which was later documented in detail in [[Cheng Zongyou]]'s ''Exposition of the Original Shaolin Staff Method'', published around 1610.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> By contrast, Shaolin unarmed fighting techniques are not mentioned. The entire listing of late Ming dynasty martial arts was later copied without attribution by a manual of the Shaolin style, the ''Hand Combat Classic'' (''Quanjing quanfa beiyao''). However, the later manual, with a preface dated to 1784, altered the text, adding a spurious claim that the history of hand combat had originated at the Shaolin Monastery.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=116\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nQi's discussion of hand-to-hand combat makes no mention of a spiritual element to the martial arts, nor does it allude to breathing or [[qi]] circulation. By contrast, Chinese martial arts texts from the [[Manchu conquest of China|Ming-Qing transition]] onward represent a synthesis of functional martial arts techniques with [[Taoist|Daoist]] ''[[tao yin|daoyin]]'' health practices, breathing exercises, and meditation.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=148\u2013149}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lorge|2011|p=202}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nQi Jiguang was one of several Ming authors to document the military tactics and martial arts techniques of the era.

It is unclear whether this was the result of misdiagnosed children improving in mathematics and spatial awareness as they progressed as normal, or that the subjects who showed improvement were accurately diagnosed, but exhibited signs of a non-persistent learning disability. \n\n=== Persistence in adults ===\nThere are very few studies of adults with dyscalculia who have had a history of it growing up, but such studies have shown that it can persist into adulthood.

The adults cannot process their errors on the math problems or may not even recognize that they have made these errors. Visual-spatial input, auditory input, and touch input will be affected due to these processing errors.

As a result of this, students may develop a lot of anxiety and frustration. After dealing with their anxiety for a long time, students can become averse to math and try to avoid it as much as possible, which may result in lower grades in math courses. However, students with dyscalculia often do exceptionally in writing, reading, and speaking. Students may try to succeed through determination and persistence because of their inability to do well with numbers. They may try to keep a positive attitude even with the frustration and anxiety because they want to meet their goal in life.

Kosc defined dyscalculia as \"a structural disorder of mathematical abilities.\" His research proved that the learning disability was caused by impairments to certain parts of the brain that control mathematical calculations and not because symptomatic individuals were 'mentally handicapped'. Researchers now sometimes use the terms \u201cmath dyslexia\u201d or \u201cmath learning disability\u201d when they mention the condition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/62436/11-facts-about-math-disorder-dyscalculia|title=11 Facts About the Math Disorder Dyscalculia|date=2015-04-06|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}</ref> Cognitive disabilities specific to mathematics were originally identified in case studies with patients who experienced specific arithmetic disabilities as a result of damage to specific regions of the brain.  More commonly, dyscalculia occurs developmentally as a genetically linked learning disability which affects a person's ability to understand, remember, or manipulate numbers or number facts (e.g., the [[multiplication table]]s). The term is often used to refer specifically to the inability to perform arithmetic operations, but is also defined by some educational professionals and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]] such as [[Stanislas Dehaene]]<ref name=\"Dehaene1997\">{{cite book|title=The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics|url=https://archive.org/details/numbersensehowmi0000deha|url-access=registration|last=Dehaene|first=S.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19-513240-3|location=New York}}</ref> and [[Brian Butterworth]]<ref name=\"Butterworth, 2011\" /> as a more fundamental inability to conceptualize numbers as abstract concepts of comparative quantities (a deficit in \"[[number sense]]\"), which these researchers consider to be a foundational skill upon which other mathematics abilities build. Symptoms of dyscalculia include the delay of simple counting, inability to memorize simple arithmetic facts such as adding, subtracting, etc. There are few known symptoms because little research has been done on the topic.<ref name=\"Butterworth, 2010\" /><ref name=\"Butterworth, 2011\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''dyscalculia'' dates back to at least 1949.<ref name=\"Pollak2009\">{{cite book|last=Trott |first=Clare |editor-first=David |editor-last= Pollak|title=Neurodiversity in Higher Education: Positive Responses to Specific Learning Differences |chapter=Dyscalculia|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVhQoqboi1UC&pg=PA125 |date=5 March 2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99753-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Kosc, Ladislav |year=1974 |title=Developmental dyscalculia |journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities |volume=7 |number=3 |pages=159\u201362 |doi=10.1177/002221947400700309}}</ref>\n\nDyscalculia comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] and means \"counting badly\".

Students may try to succeed through determination and persistence because of their inability to do well with numbers. They may try to keep a positive attitude even with the frustration and anxiety because they want to meet their goal in life.

Researchers now sometimes use the terms \u201cmath dyslexia\u201d or \u201cmath learning disability\u201d when they mention the condition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/62436/11-facts-about-math-disorder-dyscalculia|title=11 Facts About the Math Disorder Dyscalculia|date=2015-04-06|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}</ref> Cognitive disabilities specific to mathematics were originally identified in case studies with patients who experienced specific arithmetic disabilities as a result of damage to specific regions of the brain.  More commonly, dyscalculia occurs developmentally as a genetically linked learning disability which affects a person's ability to understand, remember, or manipulate numbers or number facts (e.g., the [[multiplication table]]s). The term is often used to refer specifically to the inability to perform arithmetic operations, but is also defined by some educational professionals and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]] such as [[Stanislas Dehaene]]<ref name=\"Dehaene1997\">{{cite book|title=The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics|url=https://archive.org/details/numbersensehowmi0000deha|url-access=registration|last=Dehaene|first=S.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19-513240-3|location=New York}}</ref> and [[Brian Butterworth]]<ref name=\"Butterworth, 2011\" /> as a more fundamental inability to conceptualize numbers as abstract concepts of comparative quantities (a deficit in \"[[number sense]]\"), which these researchers consider to be a foundational skill upon which other mathematics abilities build.

The arm holding up the trap has the [[Flag of Iraq|Iraqi flag]] on it.]]\n\nPsychological operations are a vital part of the broad range of U.S. political, military, economic and ideological activities used by the U.S. government to secure national objectives. PSYOP is the dissemination of information to foreign audiences in support of U.S. policy and national objectives.\n\nUsed during peacetime, contingencies and declared war, these activities are not forms of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments. Persuading rather than compelling physically, they rely on logic, fear, desire, or other mental factors to promote specific emotions, attitudes, or behaviors. The ultimate objective of U.S. military psychological operations is to convince enemy, neutral, and friendly nations and forces to take action favorable to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nPsychological operations support national security objectives at the tactical, operational and strategic levels of operations. Strategic psychological operations advance broad or long-term objectives. Global in nature, they may be directed toward large audiences or at key communicators.\n\nOperational psychological operations are conducted on a smaller scale. They are employed by theater commanders to target groups within the [[theater of operations]]. Their purpose can range from gaining support for U.S. operations to preparing the battlefield for combat.\n\nTactical psychological operations are more limited, used by commanders to secure immediate and near-term goals. In this environment, these force-enhancing activities serve as a means to lower the morale and efficiency of enemy forces.\n\nBoth tactical and theater-level psychological operations may be used to enhance peacetime military activities of conventional forces operating in foreign countries. Cultural awareness packages attune U.S. forces before departing overseas. In theater, media programs publicize the positive aspects of combined military exercises and deployments.\n\nIn addition to supporting commanders, PSYOP units provide interagency support to other [[U.S. government]] agencies. In operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to drug interdiction, psychological operations enhance the impact of those agencies' actions.

The arm holding up the trap has the [[Flag of Iraq|Iraqi flag]] on it.]]\n\nPsychological operations are a vital part of the broad range of U.S. political, military, economic and ideological activities used by the U.S. government to secure national objectives. PSYOP is the dissemination of information to foreign audiences in support of U.S. policy and national objectives.\n\nUsed during peacetime, contingencies and declared war, these activities are not forms of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments. Persuading rather than compelling physically, they rely on logic, fear, desire, or other mental factors to promote specific emotions, attitudes, or behaviors. The ultimate objective of U.S. military psychological operations is to convince enemy, neutral, and friendly nations and forces to take action favorable to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nPsychological operations support national security objectives at the tactical, operational and strategic levels of operations. Strategic psychological operations advance broad or long-term objectives. Global in nature, they may be directed toward large audiences or at key communicators.\n\nOperational psychological operations are conducted on a smaller scale. They are employed by theater commanders to target groups within the [[theater of operations]]. Their purpose can range from gaining support for U.S. operations to preparing the battlefield for combat.\n\nTactical psychological operations are more limited, used by commanders to secure immediate and near-term goals. In this environment, these force-enhancing activities serve as a means to lower the morale and efficiency of enemy forces.\n\nBoth tactical and theater-level psychological operations may be used to enhance peacetime military activities of conventional forces operating in foreign countries. Cultural awareness packages attune U.S. forces before departing overseas. In theater, media programs publicize the positive aspects of combined military exercises and deployments.\n\nIn addition to supporting commanders, PSYOP units provide interagency support to other [[U.S. government]] agencies. In operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to drug interdiction, psychological operations enhance the impact of those agencies' actions. Their activities can be used to spread information about ongoing programs and to gain support from the local populace.\n\nPsychological operations units in the U.S. Army Reserve are language and culturally oriented.
