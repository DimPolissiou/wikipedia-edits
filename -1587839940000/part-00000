A large part of Wrekenton consists of a [[council estate]], known as [[Springwell Estate]]. This is distinct from [[Springwell Village]], which is located a short distance across the border, within the [[City of Sunderland]].\n\n== History ==\nThe antiquarian [[John Hodgson (antiquary)|John Hodgson]] claimed to have named the village. He wrote, \"After the enclosure of the common (in 1822), Mr. Watson, of Warburton Place, Carrhill, founded a considerable village at this place, which, at my suggestion, he called Wrekenton.\" This name was chosen because Wrekenton and Eighton Banks were divided by the remains of the Wrekendyke Roman road. Wrekenton is believed to have been the meeting point of two Roman roads, [[Cade's Road]] and the Wrekendyke Road. Cade's Road ran from the [[Humber]] to [[Eboracum|York]] and [[Pons Aelius|Newcastle]], with the Wrekendyke Road branching away to the north east passing close to [[Jarrow]], and ending at the Roman fort and harbour of [[Arbeia]], at [[South Shields]]. It has even been conjectured that a Roman fort existed at the site now occupied by the Ravensworth Golf Club, but no evidence for this has been found.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wrekenton was still a very small village with about two hundred dwellings. It remained so for a further seventy years until [[slum clearance]] in Gateshead resulted in many new houses being built in Wrekenton, in order to accommodate the previous slum-dwellers. The main industries of the area surrounding the village during the nineteenth century were coal mining, quarrying, brickmaking and agriculture. The spelling of the town's name is recorded, in the mid 1890s, as \"Wreckenton\", which survived as the name of the local council ward serving the area until 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukga.org/england/Durham/towns/Wreckenton.html|title=Wreckenton, Durham|last=|first=|date=|website=UK Genealogy Archives|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOld Durham Road was the main route between [[Durham, England|Durham]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] until 1827, when a new road was built to the west of it on lower ground and called Durham Road. Old Durham Road climbed the steep bank, known as Long Bank to Wrekenton and from there headed north to Beacon Lough before dropping down the steep bank into Gateshead. The mail coach used to pass along this road and one of the stopping places for the coach was ''The Coach and Horses'', an inn that still exists today.

The market awarded the more affordable Vietnamese coffee suppliers with trade and caused less efficient coffee bean farmers in many countries such as [[Brazil]], Nicaragua, and [[Ethiopia]] not to be able to live off of their products, which at many times were priced below the cost of production, forcing many to quit the coffee bean production and move into slums in the cities.

This rise was likely caused by an increase in consumption in [[Russia]] and China as well as a harvest which was about 10 to 20 percent lower than that in the record years before. Many coffee bean farmers can now live off their products, but not all of the extra-surplus trickles down to them, because rising petroleum prices make the transportation, roasting and packaging of the coffee beans more expensive.

They have capital resources to obtain quality coffee from around the world, capital normal roasters do not have.  Roasters' heavy reliance on importers gives the importers great influence over the types of coffee that are sold to consumers.\n\nIn the United States, there are around 1,200 roasters.  Roasters have the highest [[profit margin]] in the commodity chain.<ref name=\"ge\" />  Large roasters normally sell pre-packaged coffee to large retailers, such as [[Maxwell House]], [[Folgers]] and [[Millstone Coffee|Millstone]].\n\nCoffee reaches the consumers through cafes and specialty stores selling coffee, of which, approximately, 30 percent are chains, and through supermarkets and traditional retail chains.  Supermarkets and traditional retail chains hold about 60 percent of market share and are the primary channel for both specialty coffee and non-specialty coffee.  Twelve billion pounds of coffee is consumed around the globe annually, and the United States alone has over 130 million coffee drinkers.\n\nCoffee is also bought and sold by investors and price speculators as a tradable commodity.

The market awarded the more affordable Vietnamese coffee suppliers with trade and caused less efficient coffee bean farmers in many countries such as [[Brazil]], Nicaragua, and [[Ethiopia]] not to be able to live off of their products, which at many times were priced below the cost of production, forcing many to quit the coffee bean production and move into slums in the cities. (Mai, 2006).\n\n[[File:DirkvdM orosi hill plantation.jpg|thumb|250px|A coffee plantation on a hill near [[Oros\u00ed]], Costa Rica.]]\n\nThe decline in the ingredient cost of green coffee, while not the only cost component of the final cup being served, occurred at the same time as the rise in popularity specialty caf\u00e9s, which sold their beverages at unprecedented high prices.\nAccording to the [[Specialty Coffee Association of America]], in 2004 16 percent of adults in the United States drank specialty coffee daily; the number of retail specialty coffee locations, including caf\u00e9s, kiosks, coffee carts and retail roasters, amounted to 17,400 and total sales were $8.96 billion in 2003.\n\nSpecialty coffee, however, is frequently not purchased on commodities exchanges\u2014for example, [[Starbucks]] purchases nearly all its coffee through multi-year, private contracts that often pay double the commodity price.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rickert, Eve | title = Environmental effects of the coffee crisis: a case study of land use and avian communities in Agua Buena, Costa Rica | publisher = M.Sc.

This rise was likely caused by an increase in consumption in [[Russia]] and China as well as a harvest which was about 10 to 20 percent lower than that in the record years before. Many coffee bean farmers can now live off their products, but not all of the extra-surplus trickles down to them, because rising petroleum prices make the transportation, roasting and packaging of the coffee beans more expensive. Prices have risen from 2005 to 2009 and sharply in the second half of 2010 on fears of a bad harvest in key coffee-producing countries, with the ICO indicator price reaching 231 in March 2011.<ref>{{cite web | author = ICO | title = ICO Indicator Prices | url = http://www.ico.org/prices/p2.htm | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060529024152/http://www.ico.org/prices/p2.htm | archivedate = 29 May 2006 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:coffee shadow trees costa rica.jpg|thumb|250px|Shade trees in [[Oros\u00ed]] in Costa Rica.

Under either arrangement, large producers can sell at prices set by the [[New York Coffee Exchange]].\n\nGreen coffee is then purchased by importers from exporters or large plantation owners.<ref name=\"ge\" />  Importers hold inventory of large container loads, which they sell gradually through numerous small orders.  They have capital resources to obtain quality coffee from around the world, capital normal roasters do not have.  Roasters' heavy reliance on importers gives the importers great influence over the types of coffee that are sold to consumers.\n\nIn the United States, there are around 1,200 roasters.  Roasters have the highest [[profit margin]] in the commodity chain.<ref name=\"ge\" />  Large roasters normally sell pre-packaged coffee to large retailers, such as [[Maxwell House]], [[Folgers]] and [[Millstone Coffee|Millstone]].\n\nCoffee reaches the consumers through cafes and specialty stores selling coffee, of which, approximately, 30 percent are chains, and through supermarkets and traditional retail chains.  Supermarkets and traditional retail chains hold about 60 percent of market share and are the primary channel for both specialty coffee and non-specialty coffee.  Twelve billion pounds of coffee is consumed around the globe annually, and the United States alone has over 130 million coffee drinkers.\n\nCoffee is also bought and sold by investors and price speculators as a tradable commodity.

He attended [[Simpson College]] in Iowa, but dropped out when he was 19. He worked various jobs around the country as a bouncer, cable television contractor, framer building beach houses, dishwasher, baker, ditch digger and slaughterhouse worker. He attended the [[University of Oklahoma]] for one semester before returning to Amarillo, where he entered a mixed martial arts tournament.\n\nDuring his UFC career, Tanner lived in [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. In 2008, he relocated to [[Oceanside, California]].\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n\n===Early career===\nTanner, with a [[wrestling]] background, began fighting in 1997 when he was convinced by friends to enter a local MMA tournament hosted by the now defunct Unified Shoot Wrestling Federation. He won the tournament by defeating three fighters in one night, including future UFC heavyweight contender [[Paul Buentello]].\n\nAfter his initial success, Tanner taught himself submission and [[grappling]] techniques using instructional videos created by the famous [[Gracie family]]. He continued to fight in local shows and tournaments in Texas and Iowa before traveling to Japan to compete in the Pancrase organization. He won five fights overseas and competed in the USWF once more before being asked to join the UFC.\n\nTanner made his UFC debut in 1999 at ''[[UFC 18]]'', submitting fellow Amarillo native Darrell Gholar by [[rear naked choke]] in the first round. His next UFC fight was at ''[[UFC 19]]'' against Valerie Ignatov, who was known for leg submissions. Because of this, Tanner decided to fight barefoot for the first time in his career.\n\nTanner fought once more in Pancrase and defended his title two more times in the USWF before deciding to take the first of multiple breaks from fighting in his career. He returned in July 2000 and remained undefeated in the USWF, successfully defending his heavyweight belt with wins against Raoul Romero and Vinny Nixon. His next appearance was at ''[[UFC 29]]'', where he defeated [[Lance Gibson]] by [[Knockout|TKO]].\n\n===A new outlook on fighting===\nWith three victories in the UFC, Tanner received a title shot against [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC light heavyweight champion]] [[Tito Ortiz]] at ''[[UFC 30]]''. He was knocked unconscious 32 seconds into the first round by a high level slam by Ortiz.\n\nTanner was invited to compete in the \u221288&nbsp;kg division at the 2001 [[ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship]] April 11\u201313, 2001 at the Abu Dhabi Combat Club in [[Abu Dhabi]], United Arab Emirates. He was defeated by [[Sanae Kikuta]] on points (6\u20130) in the first round.\n\nTanner began training with [[Oregon]]-based [[Team Quest]]. He returned to the Octagon at ''[[UFC 34]]'', defeating [[Homer Moore]] in the second round with an [[armbar]]. At ''[[UFC 36]],'' he defeated [[Elvis Sinosic]] by TKO (cut). At ''[[UFC 38]],'' he won a unanimous decision over [[Chris Haseman]] in an undercard bout. At ''[[UFC 42]],'' he lost to Rich Franklin by [[Knockout#Technical knockout|TKO]] (strikes) in the first round. After his defeat by Franklin, Tanner moved to the middleweight division, where he would be more physically imposing than many of the opponents.\n\n===Baroni I and II===\nTanner faced [[Phil Baroni]] in consecutive fights at ''[[UFC 45]]'' and ''[[UFC 48]].'' In the early minutes of their fight at UFC 45, Baroni was in control, but Tanner took Baroni to the ground and landed a series of unanswered punches and elbows. After a brief verbal exchange between Baroni and referee Larry Landless, the fight was stopped and Tanner was awarded the victory. Immediately after the fight, Baroni contended that he did not submit and in the confusion struck Landless twice in the face. Baroni maintained that it was a verbal miscommunication and he never asked for the fight to be stopped. To quell the controversy, the UFC agreed to give Baroni a rematch at [[UFC 48]], which Tanner won.\n\n===Road to the UFC Middleweight title===\nTanner defeated [[Robbie Lawler]] at ''[[UFC 50]]'' in October 2004, submitting Lawler with a [[triangle choke]]. Afterwards, Tanner began training on his own.\n\nHe fought for the vacant UFC middleweight championship against [[David Terrell (fighter)|David Terrell]] at ''[[UFC 51]]'' in February 2005. He defeated Terrell to become the first UFC middleweight champion since [[Murilo Bustamante]] held the title before leaving for [[PRIDE Fighting Championships]] in 2002.\n\nTanner fought Franklin again at ''[[UFC 53]]'' in June 2005. Franklin won when the fight was stopped by the ringside doctor due to multiple cuts and swelling on Tanner's face. With the win, Franklin was named as a coach for ''[[The Ultimate Fighter 2]]'' reality television show, along with then [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] [[Welterweight]] champion [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]]. While Franklin and Hughes did not fight at the conclusion of the show, Hughes said he would have challenged Tanner for the UFC middleweight title if Tanner had been a coach on the show.\n\nAfter losing the title, Tanner began training with [[American Top Team]], but lost his next fight to [[David Loiseau]] at [[UFC Ultimate Fight Night 2|Ultimate Fight Night 2]] in October 2005. Tanner was ahead on points until the fight was stopped in the second round due to a cut received from a Loiseau elbow.\n\nShortly after this fight, Tanner appeared as himself on an episode of ''[[Beyond the Glory]]'' that chronicled the history of the [[UFC]]. He also became a member of the [[Chute Boxe]] team.\n\nTanner returned to the UFC in April 2006 at ''[[UFC 59]]'', defeating [[Justin Levens]] in what was Tanner's last victory in MMA. Levens was a late replacement for [[Jeremy Horn]], who was forced to withdraw after a training injury.\n\n===2006\u201308===\nOn December 29, 2006, Tanner unveiled plans to set up a mixed martial arts training camp at his house in [[Gresham, Oregon]] for disadvantaged athletes and young men at risk. In February 2007, he announced that 12 athletes would reside in the house from six different weight classes. In a March 2007 interview with MMA Weekly, Tanner was asked about the possibility of fighting again, but said he wanted to focus on developing his foundation. He said he would be training year-round with the athletes he was coaching and that it might only be a matter of time before he returned. UFC president [[Dana White]] was interviewed by [[CBS]] Sportsline one week later and said Tanner would be welcomed back whenever he was ready.\n\nOn May 11, 2007, further foundation development was put on hold by Tanner, citing his own training and a bad experience with the first fighter that was invited to the house. Tanner announced through his official website that he would return to active competition and attempt to regain the UFC middleweight title.\n\nSpeculation arose that Tanner would return to the UFC in December 2007 at [[UFC 79]] against [[Dean Lister]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Stupp |first=Dann |url=http://mmajunkie.com/2007/09/03/reports-dean-lister-vs-evan-tanner-tentatively-planned-for-ufc-79/ |title=Reports: Dean Lister vs. Evan Tanner Tentatively Planned for UFC 79 |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=September 3, 2007 |access-date=December 14, 2010}}</ref> Tanner dismissed the report as he was battling an alcohol addiction.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mrosko |first=Geno |url=http://ufcmania.com/2007/09/18/evan-tanner-drinking-not-fighting/ |title=Evan Tanner: Drinking ... not fighting \u2013 MMA Mania |publisher=Ufcmania.com |date=September 18, 2007 |access-date=December 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022041912/http://ufcmania.com/2007/09/18/evan-tanner-drinking-not-fighting// |archive-date=October 22, 2007 }}</ref> He left Chute Boxe and began training at Hard Knocks Kickboxing in Las Vegas.<ref name=\"evantanner.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.evantanner.net/news_on_the_foundation |title=evantanner.net |publisher=evantanner.net |access-date=December 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316115525/http://www.evantanner.net/news_on_the_foundation |archive-date=March 16, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn November 8, 2007, Tanner announced the signing of a four-fight deal with the UFC. He chose to accept no corporate sponsorships and instead started \"Team Tanner,\" an exclusive fan club for his upcoming fights.<ref name=\"evantanner.net\"/>\n\nHis first fight back in the UFC was at [[UFC 82]], where he lost to Japanese fighter [[Yushin Okami]] by knockout in the second round.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=EventDetail.FightCard&eid=1056 |title=Ultimate Fighting Championship |publisher=Ufc.com |access-date=December 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412015133/http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=EventDetail.FightCard&eid=1056 |archive-date=April 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn what would be his final fight, Tanner lost to [[Kendall Grove]] in a split decision at [[TUF 7|The Ultimate Fighter 7 Finale]] on June 21, 2008, the fifth loss in his last ten fights. In a post-match interview, he said he felt \"flat\" throughout the fight and that he had begun wondering if his two years of serious [[alcohol abuse]] had damaged his body past the point of which he could compete at the level he once had.<ref name=\"tanner_blog\">Tanner, Evan. \"[http://www.spike.com/blog/treasure-hunting-in/67570]\", Spike.com, published August 16, 2008.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nIn the summer of 2008, Tanner announced plans for a solo trip to the Imperial County, California desert. After concerns were raised, he responded on August 27, 2008. \"It seems some MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) websites have reported on the story, posting up that I might die out in the desert, or that it might be my greatest opponent yet, etc. Come on, guys. It's really common down in Southern California to go out to the off-road recreation areas in the desert about an hour away from LA and [[San Diego]]. So my plan is to go out to the desert, do some camping, ride the motorcycle, and shoot some guns. Sounds like a lot of fun to me. A lot of people do it.

This conflicted with a later report that his bike was found at his camp.<ref name=baker/> He reportedly intended to refill his water bottles at Clapp Spring before heading back to his campsite, but was unaware that the spring was usually dry. Temperatures that day reached 118&nbsp;\u00b0F (48&nbsp;\u00b0C), but in a text message to a friend, he said he thought he could make it back to his camp if he traveled during the later hours of the evening. He told friends to contact authorities if they didn't hear from him by the following morning.\n\nWhen friends didn't hear from him the next morning, they reported Tanner missing and a search was begun.<ref name=baker /> His body was discovered near Clapp Spring with empty water bottles by a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] helicopter on September 8, 2008. The Imperial County coroner determined the time of death to be between late September 4 and early September 5, but the legal date of death was recorded as September 8, 2008. According to a military article, Tanner's motorcycle was at his camp and within his provisions were ample supplies of water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/news/article/marine-corps-news/marines-find-ufc-champions-body.html?col=1186032366495 |title=Marines Find UFC Champion's Body |publisher=Military.com |date=September 9, 2008 |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref> The Imperial County sheriff's office gave an official cause of death as [[hyperthermia|heat exposure]].<ref name=baker/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nA [[celebration of life]] service was held in Amarillo, Texas on September 27. An informal gathering was held at a friend's house in Oceanside and attended by Tanner's sister and close friends. At dusk, a candlelight vigil was held.\n\nThe UFC honored Tanner during the [[Spike TV]] broadcast of [[UFC Fight Night: Diaz vs. Neer]] on September 17, 2008. Pancrase paid tribute to Tanner with a special ceremony during their 15th Anniversary Show on October 1, 2008. [[Shark Fights]] also honored Tanner during their inaugural event at the [[Amarillo National Center]] on October 24, 2008. The 2008 [[World MMA Awards]] show on December 31, 2008 in Las Vegas was dedicated to Tanner's memory.\n\nA documentary about Tanner's life, travels and philosophy, \"Once I Was A Champion,\" was directed by Gerard Roxburgh<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onceiwasachampion.com/about-the-project.aspx |title=Evan Tanner |publisher=Once I Was a Champion |date=September 8, 2008 |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref> and premiered in competition at the 2011 [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] as an official selection.

The film was also an official selection at the 2011 Dallas Video Festival and the inaugural Arclight Documentary Film Festival in November 2011. It won the \"Best Documentary Audience Award\" at the 2011 [[Bel Air Film Festival]]. In March 2014, English film director and producer [[Bobby Razak]] released a documentary about Tanner titled \"1\" which looked at the circumstances surrounding Tanner's death. On June 19, 2019, [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] reported that a biopic about Tanner's life and career titled \"The Power of 1\" was in the works, slated to go into pre-production at the end of 2019

He was a former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] [[Middleweight]] [[Champion]] and the first American to win the [[Pancrase]] Neo-Blood tournament in Tokyo, Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=fighter.detail&pid=132 |title=Ultimate Fighting Championship |publisher=Ufc.com |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330091605/http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=fighter.detail&pid=132 |archivedate=March 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nTanner won the [[UFC Middleweight Championship]] at ''[[UFC 51]]'', stopping [[David Terrell (fighter)|David Terrell]] with strikes in the first round. He is considered a pioneer in the sport of [[MMA]] and one of the first fighters to use [[elbows]] as an effective [[Strike (attack)|striking]] method in the ground and pound position.\n\nTanner is considered to be somewhat of an anomaly in MMA as he began his professional career with a large degree of success despite primarily learning the sport via instructional [[videotape]]. He was also one of the first MMA fighters to use [[social media]] as a platform to connect with fans.\n\nTanner earned notable career victories over former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] [[Welterweight]] [[Champion]] [[Robbie Lawler]], former King of [[Pancrase]] [[Middleweight]] and [[Welterweight]] [[Champion]] [[Kiuma Kunioku]], [[Heath Herring]], [[Paul Buentello]], [[Phil Baroni]] (x2) and [[Ikuhisa Minowa]], among others.\n\n==Background==\nTanner was born in [[Amarillo]], Texas and graduated in 1989 from [[Caprock High School]], where he won the Texas state championship in [[wrestling]] as a junior and senior despite<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hometeamsonline.com/teams/default.asp?u=CAPROCKWRESTLING&t=c&s=htosports&p=records |title=Caprock Wrestling |publisher=hometeamsonline.com |date= |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}</ref> only entering the sport in his second year of high school. He attended [[Simpson College]] in Iowa, but dropped out when he was 19. He worked various jobs around the country as a bouncer, cable television contractor, framer building beach houses, dishwasher, baker, ditch digger and slaughterhouse worker. He attended the [[University of Oklahoma]] for one semester before returning to Amarillo, where he entered a mixed martial arts tournament.\n\nDuring his UFC career, Tanner lived in [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. In 2008, he relocated to [[Oceanside, California]].\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n\n===Early career===\nTanner, with a [[wrestling]] background, began fighting in 1997 when he was convinced by friends to enter a local MMA tournament hosted by the now defunct Unified Shoot Wrestling Federation. He won the tournament by defeating three fighters in one night, including future UFC heavyweight contender [[Paul Buentello]].\n\nAfter his initial success, Tanner taught himself submission and [[grappling]] techniques using instructional videos created by the famous [[Gracie family]]. He continued to fight in local shows and tournaments in Texas and Iowa before traveling to Japan to compete in the Pancrase organization. He won five fights overseas and competed in the USWF once more before being asked to join the UFC.\n\nTanner made his UFC debut in 1999 at ''[[UFC 18]]'', submitting fellow Amarillo native Darrell Gholar by [[rear naked choke]] in the first round. His next UFC fight was at ''[[UFC 19]]'' against Valerie Ignatov, who was known for leg submissions. Because of this, Tanner decided to fight barefoot for the first time in his career.\n\nTanner fought once more in Pancrase and defended his title two more times in the USWF before deciding to take the first of multiple breaks from fighting in his career. He returned in July 2000 and remained undefeated in the USWF, successfully defending his heavyweight belt with wins against Raoul Romero and Vinny Nixon. His next appearance was at ''[[UFC 29]]'', where he defeated [[Lance Gibson]] by [[Knockout|TKO]].\n\n===A new outlook on fighting===\nWith three victories in the UFC, Tanner received a title shot against [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC light heavyweight champion]] [[Tito Ortiz]] at ''[[UFC 30]]''. He was knocked unconscious 32 seconds into the first round by a high level slam by Ortiz.\n\nTanner was invited to compete in the \u221288&nbsp;kg division at the 2001 [[ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship]] April 11\u201313, 2001 at the Abu Dhabi Combat Club in [[Abu Dhabi]], United Arab Emirates. He was defeated by [[Sanae Kikuta]] on points (6\u20130) in the first round.\n\nTanner began training with [[Oregon]]-based [[Team Quest]]. He returned to the Octagon at ''[[UFC 34]]'', defeating [[Homer Moore]] in the second round with an [[armbar]]. At ''[[UFC 36]],'' he defeated [[Elvis Sinosic]] by TKO (cut). At ''[[UFC 38]],'' he won a unanimous decision over [[Chris Haseman]] in an undercard bout. At ''[[UFC 42]],'' he lost to Rich Franklin by [[Knockout#Technical knockout|TKO]] (strikes) in the first round. After his defeat by Franklin, Tanner moved to the middleweight division, where he would be more physically imposing than many of the opponents.\n\n===Baroni I and II===\nTanner faced [[Phil Baroni]] in consecutive fights at ''[[UFC 45]]'' and ''[[UFC 48]].'' In the early minutes of their fight at UFC 45, Baroni was in control, but Tanner took Baroni to the ground and landed a series of unanswered punches and elbows. After a brief verbal exchange between Baroni and referee Larry Landless, the fight was stopped and Tanner was awarded the victory. Immediately after the fight, Baroni contended that he did not submit and in the confusion struck Landless twice in the face. Baroni maintained that it was a verbal miscommunication and he never asked for the fight to be stopped. To quell the controversy, the UFC agreed to give Baroni a rematch at [[UFC 48]], which Tanner won.\n\n===Road to the UFC Middleweight title===\nTanner defeated [[Robbie Lawler]] at ''[[UFC 50]]'' in October 2004, submitting Lawler with a [[triangle choke]]. Afterwards, Tanner began training on his own.\n\nHe fought for the vacant UFC middleweight championship against [[David Terrell (fighter)|David Terrell]] at ''[[UFC 51]]'' in February 2005. He defeated Terrell to become the first UFC middleweight champion since [[Murilo Bustamante]] held the title before leaving for [[PRIDE Fighting Championships]] in 2002.\n\nTanner fought Franklin again at ''[[UFC 53]]'' in June 2005. Franklin won when the fight was stopped by the ringside doctor due to multiple cuts and swelling on Tanner's face. With the win, Franklin was named as a coach for ''[[The Ultimate Fighter 2]]'' reality television show, along with then [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] [[Welterweight]] champion [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]]. While Franklin and Hughes did not fight at the conclusion of the show, Hughes said he would have challenged Tanner for the UFC middleweight title if Tanner had been a coach on the show.\n\nAfter losing the title, Tanner began training with [[American Top Team]], but lost his next fight to [[David Loiseau]] at [[UFC Ultimate Fight Night 2|Ultimate Fight Night 2]] in October 2005. Tanner was ahead on points until the fight was stopped in the second round due to a cut received from a Loiseau elbow.\n\nShortly after this fight, Tanner appeared as himself on an episode of [[Beyond the Glory]] that chronicled the history of the [[UFC]]. He also became a member of the [[Chute Boxe]] team.\n\nTanner returned to the UFC in April 2006 at ''[[UFC 59]]'', defeating [[Justin Levens]] in what was Tanner's last victory in MMA. Levens was a late replacement for [[Jeremy Horn]], who was forced to withdraw after a training injury.\n\n===2006\u201308===\nOn December 29, 2006, Tanner unveiled plans to set up a mixed martial arts training camp at his house in [[Gresham, Oregon]] for disadvantaged athletes and young men at risk. In February 2007, he announced that 12 athletes would reside in the house from six different weight classes. In a March 2007 interview with MMA Weekly, Tanner was asked about the possibility of fighting again, but said he wanted to focus on developing his foundation. He said he would be training year-round with the athletes he was coaching and that it might only be a matter of time before he returned. UFC president [[Dana White]] was interviewed by [[CBS]] Sportsline one week later and said Tanner would be welcomed back whenever he was ready.\n\nOn May 11, 2007, further foundation development was put on hold by Tanner, citing his own training and a bad experience with the first fighter that was invited to the house. Tanner announced through his official website that he would return to active competition and attempt to regain the UFC middleweight title.\n\nSpeculation arose that Tanner would return to the UFC in December 2007 at [[UFC 79]] against [[Dean Lister]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Stupp |first=Dann |url=http://mmajunkie.com/2007/09/03/reports-dean-lister-vs-evan-tanner-tentatively-planned-for-ufc-79/ |title=Reports: Dean Lister vs. Evan Tanner Tentatively Planned for UFC 79 |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=September 3, 2007 |access-date=December 14, 2010}}</ref> Tanner dismissed the report as he was battling an alcohol addiction.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mrosko |first=Geno |url=http://ufcmania.com/2007/09/18/evan-tanner-drinking-not-fighting/ |title=Evan Tanner: Drinking ... not fighting \u2013 MMA Mania |publisher=Ufcmania.com |date=September 18, 2007 |access-date=December 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022041912/http://ufcmania.com/2007/09/18/evan-tanner-drinking-not-fighting// |archive-date=October 22, 2007 }}</ref> He left Chute Boxe and began training at Hard Knocks Kickboxing in Las Vegas.<ref name=\"evantanner.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.evantanner.net/news_on_the_foundation |title=evantanner.net |publisher=evantanner.net |access-date=December 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316115525/http://www.evantanner.net/news_on_the_foundation |archive-date=March 16, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn November 8, 2007, Tanner announced the signing of a four-fight deal with the UFC. He chose to accept no corporate sponsorships and instead started \"Team Tanner,\" an exclusive fan club for his upcoming fights.<ref name=\"evantanner.net\"/>\n\nHis first fight back in the UFC was at [[UFC 82]], where he lost to Japanese fighter [[Yushin Okami]] by knockout in the second round.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=EventDetail.FightCard&eid=1056 |title=Ultimate Fighting Championship |publisher=Ufc.com |access-date=December 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412015133/http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=EventDetail.FightCard&eid=1056 |archive-date=April 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn what would be his final fight, Tanner lost to [[Kendall Grove]] in a split decision at [[TUF 7|The Ultimate Fighter 7 Finale]] on June 21, 2008, the fifth loss in his last ten fights. In a post-match interview, he said he felt \"flat\" throughout the fight and that he had begun wondering if his two years of serious [[alcohol abuse]] had damaged his body past the point of which he could compete at the level he once had.<ref name=\"tanner_blog\">Tanner, Evan. \"[http://www.spike.com/blog/treasure-hunting-in/67570]\", Spike.com, published August 16, 2008.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nIn the summer of 2008, Tanner announced plans for a solo trip to the Imperial County, California desert. After concerns were raised, he responded on August 27, 2008. \"It seems some MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) websites have reported on the story, posting up that I might die out in the desert, or that it might be my greatest opponent yet, etc. Come on, guys. It's really common down in Southern California to go out to the off-road recreation areas in the desert about an hour away from LA and [[San Diego]]. So my plan is to go out to the desert, do some camping, ride the motorcycle, and shoot some guns. Sounds like a lot of fun to me. A lot of people do it.

This conflicted with a later report that his bike was found at his camp.<ref name=baker/> He reportedly intended to refill his water bottles at Clapp Spring before heading back to his campsite, but was unaware that the spring was usually dry. Temperatures that day reached 118&nbsp;\u00b0F (48&nbsp;\u00b0C), but in a text message to a friend, he said he thought he could make it back to his camp if he traveled during the later hours of the evening. He told friends to contact authorities if they didn't hear from him by the following morning.\n\nWhen friends didn't hear from him the next morning, they reported Tanner missing and a search was begun.<ref name=baker /> His body was discovered near Clapp Spring with empty water bottles by a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] helicopter on September 8, 2008. The Imperial County coroner determined the time of death to be between late September 4 and early September 5, but the legal date of death was recorded as September 8, 2008. According to a military article, Tanner's motorcycle was at his camp and within his provisions were ample supplies of water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/news/article/marine-corps-news/marines-find-ufc-champions-body.html?col=1186032366495 |title=Marines Find UFC Champion's Body |publisher=Military.com |date=September 9, 2008 |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref> The Imperial County sheriff's office gave an official cause of death as [[hyperthermia|heat exposure]].<ref name=baker/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nA [[celebration of life]] service was held in Amarillo, Texas on September 27. An informal gathering was held at a friend's house in Oceanside and attended by Tanner's sister and close friends. At dusk, a candlelight vigil was held.\n\nThe UFC honored Tanner during the [[Spike TV]] broadcast of [[UFC Fight Night: Diaz vs. Neer]] on September 17, 2008. Pancrase paid tribute to Tanner with a special ceremony during their 15th Anniversary Show on October 1, 2008. [[Shark Fights]] also honored Tanner during their inaugural event at the [[Amarillo National Center]] on October 24, 2008. The 2008 [[World MMA Awards]] show on December 31, 2008 in Las Vegas was dedicated to Tanner's memory.\n\nA documentary about Tanner's life, travels and philosophy, \"Once I Was A Champion,\" was directed by Gerard Roxburgh<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onceiwasachampion.com/about-the-project.aspx |title=Evan Tanner |publisher=Once I Was a Champion |date=September 8, 2008 |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref> and premiered in competition at the 2011 [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] as an official selection.

The film was also an official selection at the 2011 Dallas Video Festival and the inaugural Arclight Documentary Film Festival in November 2011. It won the \"Best Documentary Audience Award\" at the 2011 [[Bel Air Film Festival]]. In March 2014, English film director and producer [[Bobby Razak]] released a documentary about Tanner titled \"1\" which looked at the circumstances surrounding Tanner's death. On June 19, 2019, [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] reported that a biopic about Tanner's life and career titled \"The Power of 1\" was in the works, slated to go into pre-production at the end of 2019
