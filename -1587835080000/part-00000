The nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a [[federal government]] overseeing ethnically based regional states, zones, [[Districts of Ethiopia|districts]] (''woreda''), and ''[[kebele]]s'' (\"neighbourhoods\").\n\nSince 1996, Ethiopia has been divided into nine ethnically-based and politically autonomous [[Regions of Ethiopia|regional states]] (''kililoch'', singular ''kilil''&thinsp;) and two chartered cities (''astedader akababiwoch'', singular ''astedader akababi''&thinsp;), the latter being [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]]. The ''kililoch'' are subdivided into sixty-eight [[Zones of Ethiopia|zones]], and then further into 550 ''woredas'' and several special ''woredas''.\n\nThe constitution assigns extensive power to regional states, which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal government's constitution. Each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions.\n\nArticle 39 of the Ethiopian Constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from Ethiopia. There is debate, however, as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states. The councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus. Such elaborate structure of council, executive, and sectoral public institutions is replicated to the next level (''woreda'').\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Region or city (\u12ad\u120d\u120d/\u12e8\u12a8\u1270\u121b \u12a0\u1235\u1270\u12f3\u12f5\u122d)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Capital\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Area {{smaller|{{nobold|(km<sup>2</sup>)}}}}\n! colspan=\"4\" | Population<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.gov.et/Central |title=Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, 2005\u20132013 |accessdate=2 May 2017 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|-\n!

It lies between the [[3rd parallel north]] and the [[15th parallel north]] and longitudes [[33rd meridian east]] and [[48th meridian east]].\n\nThe major portion of Ethiopia lies in the [[Horn of Africa]], which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. The territories that have frontiers with Ethiopia are Eritrea to the north and then, moving in a clockwise direction, Djibouti, the ''de facto'' state of [[Somaliland]], Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, [[steppe]]s, or semi-desert. There is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation and settlement patterns.\n\nEthiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive [[Afromontane]] in the northern and southwestern parts. [[Lake Tana]] in the north is the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. It also has many [[endemism|endemic]] species, notably the [[gelada]], the [[walia ibex]] and the [[Ethiopian wolf]] (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Geography of Ethiopia#Climate}}\n[[File:Semien Mountains 13.jpg|thumb|[[Semien Mountains]]]]\n\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The [[Ethiopian Highlands]] cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around {{convert|2000|\u2013|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.\n[[File:Wonchi Lake of Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|left|Wonchi Lake]]\nThe modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of [[Mount Entoto]] at an elevation of around {{convert|2400|m}}. It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1200|mm|}}.\n\nThere are on average seven hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is {{convert|16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, with daily maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|20|-|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging {{convert|5|-|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\nMost major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier. Dallol, in the [[Danakil Depression]] in this eastern zone, has the world's highest average annual temperature of {{convert|34|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\n==Environment==\n{{see also|Environmental issues in Ethiopia}}\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{Main|Wildlife of Ethiopia}}\n[[File:Canis simensis -Simien Mountains, Ethiopia-8.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Ethiopian wolf]]]]\n\nEthiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals.<ref name=\"Massicot\"/> The [[African wild dog]] prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory. However, with last sightings at [[Finicha'a]], this canid is thought to be potentially [[local extinction|locally extinct]]. The Ethiopian wolf is perhaps the most researched of all the endangered species within Ethiopia.\n\nEthiopia is a global center of avian diversity.

The second period of growth was from 1967 to 1975 when rural populations migrated to urban centers seeking work and better living conditions.<ref name=\"countrystudies1991\"/>\n\nThis pattern slowed due to the 1975 Land Reform program instituted by the government, which provided incentives for people to stay in rural areas. As people moved from rural areas to the cities, there were fewer people to grow food for the population. The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 1970\u20131983. This program proliferated the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture. The act did lead to an increase in food production, although there is debate over the cause; it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform act.<ref name=\"Anderson, Frank 1991.

The current system follows school expansion schemes which are very similar to the system in the rural areas during the 1980s, with an addition of deeper regionalization, providing rural education in students' own languages starting at the elementary level, and with more budget finances allocated to the education sector. The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, four years of lower secondary school and two years of higher secondary school.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Teferra|first1=Damtew|last2=Altbach|first2=Philip G.|title=African Higher Education: An International Reference Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RROdAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34186-0|pages= 316\u201325}}</ref>\n\nAccess to education in Ethiopia has improved significantly.

Children add the [[given name]]s of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family [[surname]], and a person's given name and their father's given name form the first names.\n\nEveryone is addressed by their given name. In official situations, the prefixes ''Ato'' ('''\u12a0\u1276''') is used for men; ''Weyzero'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122e''') for married women; and ''Weyzer\u012bt'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122a\u1275''') for unmarried women.\n\n===Calendar===\n{{Main|Ethiopian calendar|Oromo calendar}}\n[[File:Celebrate The Return of Axum Obelisk (Detail) (3172365788).jpg|thumb|Model commemorating the [[Obelisk of Axum|Obelisk of Aksum]]'s return to Ethiopia from Italy, showing the date of its departure and return according to the [[Ethiopian calendar]]]]\n\nEthiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the [[Ethiopian calendar]], also known as the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or [[Coptic calendar]], which in turn derives from the [[Egyptian calendar]]. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six [[epagomenal]] days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.\n\nLike the [[Julian calendar]], the sixth epagomenal day\u2014which in essence is a [[leap day]]\u2014is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1{{nbsp}}M\u00e4sk\u00e4r\u00e4m, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. Also, a seven- to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the [[Annunciation]] of [[Jesus]].\n\nAnother calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the [[Oromo people|Oromo]]. A lunar-stellar calendar, this [[Oromo calendar]] relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent), and Gurrandala (small crescent).<ref>{{cite web|first=Lawrence R |last=Doyle |url=http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |title=The Borana Calendar Reinterpreted |work=tusker.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029073246/http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Time===\n\n[[Time in Ethiopia]] is counted differently from most countries. The Ethiopian day is reckoned as beginning at 06:00 as opposed to 00:00, coinciding with sunrise throughout the year. To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) six hours to the Western time. For example, 02:00 local Addis Ababa time is called \"8 at night\" in Ethiopia, while 20:00 is called \"2 in the evening\".\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Ethiopian cuisine}}\n{{see also|List of Ethiopian dishes and foods}}\n[[File:Alicha 1.jpg|thumb|Typical Ethiopian cuisine: ''[[injera]]'' (pancake-like bread) and several kinds of ''wat'' (stew)]]\n\nThe best-known [[Ethiopian cuisine]] consists of various types of thick [[meat]] [[stew]]s, known as ''[[wat (food)|wat]]'' in Ethiopian culture, and [[vegetable]] side dishes served atop [[injera]], a large [[sourdough]] [[flatbread]] made of [[teff]] flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead one uses the injera to scoop up the entr\u00e9es and side dishes.

The nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a [[federal government]] overseeing ethnically based regional states, zones, [[Districts of Ethiopia|districts]] (''woreda''), and ''[[kebele]]s'' (\"neighbourhoods\").\n\nSince 1996, Ethiopia has been divided into nine ethnically-based and politically autonomous [[Regions of Ethiopia|regional states]] (''kililoch'', singular ''kilil''&thinsp;) and two chartered cities (''astedader akababiwoch'', singular ''astedader akababi''&thinsp;), the latter being [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]]. The ''kililoch'' are subdivided into sixty-eight [[Zones of Ethiopia|zones]], and then further into 550 ''woredas'' and several special ''woredas''.\n\nThe constitution assigns extensive power to regional states, which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal government's constitution. Each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions.\n\nArticle 39 of the Ethiopian Constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from Ethiopia. There is debate, however, as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states. The councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus.

It lies between the [[3rd parallel north]] and the [[15th parallel north]] and longitudes [[33rd meridian east]] and [[48th meridian east]].\n\nThe major portion of Ethiopia lies in the [[Horn of Africa]], which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. The territories that have frontiers with Ethiopia are Eritrea to the north and then, moving in a clockwise direction, Djibouti, the ''de facto'' state of [[Somaliland]], Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, [[steppe]]s, or semi-desert. There is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation and settlement patterns.\n\nEthiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive [[Afromontane]] in the northern and southwestern parts. [[Lake Tana]] in the north is the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. It also has many [[endemism|endemic]] species, notably the [[gelada]], the [[walia ibex]] and the [[Ethiopian wolf]] (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Geography of Ethiopia#Climate}}\n[[File:Semien Mountains 13.jpg|thumb|[[Semien Mountains]]]]\n\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The [[Ethiopian Highlands]] cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around {{convert|2000|\u2013|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.\n[[File:Wonchi Lake of Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|left|Wonchi Lake]]\nThe modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of [[Mount Entoto]] at an elevation of around {{convert|2400|m}}. It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1200|mm|}}.\n\nThere are on average seven hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is {{convert|16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, with daily maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|20|-|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging {{convert|5|-|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\nMost major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier. Dallol, in the [[Danakil Depression]] in this eastern zone, has the world's highest average annual temperature of {{convert|34|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\n==Environment==\n{{see also|Environmental issues in Ethiopia}}\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{Main|Wildlife of Ethiopia}}\n[[File:Canis simensis -Simien Mountains, Ethiopia-8.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Ethiopian wolf]]]]\n\nEthiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals.<ref name=\"Massicot\"/> The [[African wild dog]] prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory. However, with last sightings at [[Finicha'a]], this canid is thought to be potentially [[local extinction|locally extinct]]. The Ethiopian wolf is perhaps the most researched of all the endangered species within Ethiopia.\n\nEthiopia is a global center of avian diversity. To date more than 856 bird species have been recorded in Ethiopia, twenty of which are endemic to the country.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lepage|first=Denis|title=Bird Checklists of the World|url=http://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/checklist.jsp?region=et&list=clements|publisher=Avibase|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> Sixteen species are endangered or critically endangered.

In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a bilateral treaty, the [[Water politics in the Nile Basin|1959 Nile Waters Agreement]], which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt has discouraged almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to utilize the local Nile tributaries. This had the effect of discouraging external financing of hydropower and irrigation projects in western Ethiopia, thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects. However, Ethiopia is in the process of constructing a large 6,450 MW hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile river. When completed, this [[Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam]] is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power station in Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/31/business/ethiopia-grand-renaissance-dam/index.html|title=Ethiopia powers on with controversial dam project |author1= Victoria Eastwood |author2=Nima Elbagir|access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Gilgel Gibe III Dam|Gibe III]] hydroelectric project is so far the largest in the country with an installed capacity of 1,870&nbsp;MW.

In peasant associations daily life is a struggle to survive. About 16% of the population in Ethiopia are living on less than one dollar per day (2008). Only 65% of rural households in Ethiopia consume the [[World Health Organization]]'s minimum standard of food per day (2,200 kilocalories), with 42% of children under 5 years old being underweight.<ref name=\"Crawley\">Crawley, Mike.

Children add the [[given name]]s of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family [[surname]], and a person's given name and their father's given name form the first names.\n\nEveryone is addressed by their given name. In official situations, the prefixes ''Ato'' ('''\u12a0\u1276''') is used for men; ''Weyzero'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122e''') for married women; and ''Weyzer\u012bt'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122a\u1275''') for unmarried women.\n\n===Calendar===\n{{Main|Ethiopian calendar|Oromo calendar}}\n[[File:Celebrate The Return of Axum Obelisk (Detail) (3172365788).jpg|thumb|Model commemorating the [[Obelisk of Axum|Obelisk of Aksum]]'s return to Ethiopia from Italy, showing the date of its departure and return according to the [[Ethiopian calendar]]]]\n\nEthiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the [[Ethiopian calendar]], also known as the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or [[Coptic calendar]], which in turn derives from the [[Egyptian calendar]]. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six [[epagomenal]] days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.\n\nLike the [[Julian calendar]], the sixth epagomenal day\u2014which in essence is a [[leap day]]\u2014is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1{{nbsp}}M\u00e4sk\u00e4r\u00e4m, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. Also, a seven- to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the [[Annunciation]] of [[Jesus]].\n\nAnother calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the [[Oromo people|Oromo]]. A lunar-stellar calendar, this [[Oromo calendar]] relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent), and Gurrandala (small crescent).<ref>{{cite web|first=Lawrence R |last=Doyle |url=http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |title=The Borana Calendar Reinterpreted |work=tusker.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029073246/http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Time===\n\n[[Time in Ethiopia]] is counted differently from most countries. The Ethiopian day is reckoned as beginning at 06:00 as opposed to 00:00, coinciding with sunrise throughout the year. To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) six hours to the Western time. For example, 02:00 local Addis Ababa time is called \"8 at night\" in Ethiopia, while 20:00 is called \"2 in the evening\".\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Ethiopian cuisine}}\n{{see also|List of Ethiopian dishes and foods}}\n[[File:Alicha 1.jpg|thumb|Typical Ethiopian cuisine: ''[[injera]]'' (pancake-like bread) and several kinds of ''wat'' (stew)]]\n\nThe best-known [[Ethiopian cuisine]] consists of various types of thick [[meat]] [[stew]]s, known as ''[[wat (food)|wat]]'' in Ethiopian culture, and [[vegetable]] side dishes served atop [[injera]], a large [[sourdough]] [[flatbread]] made of [[teff]] flour.

The trio were likened to the [[Greek chorus]], and the [[Weird Sisters|three witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', as they would sit in the [[The snug|snug bar]] of [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]], passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.<ref>Tinker. p. 31.</ref> Headstrong Ena often clashed with [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Pat Phoenix]]), whom she believed espoused a dauntlessly loose set of morals. Elsie resented Ena's interference and gossip, which most of the time had little basis in reality.\n\nIn April 1961, [[Jed Stone]] ([[Kenneth Cope]]) made his first appearance and returned the following year in 1962. He left in 1963, but returned three years later in 1966. He left again and then returned 42 years later in 2008.\n\nIn March 1961, ''Coronation Street'' reached No. 1 in the [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|television ratings]] and remained there for the rest of the year.<ref name=\"littlepg10\"/> Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15&nbsp;million) tuned into ''Corrie'', and by 1964 the programme had over 20&nbsp;million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on 2 December 1964, at 21.36&nbsp;million viewers.<ref>Little (1995). p. 35.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=BFI Most Watched 1960s |work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html |accessdate=29 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223181243/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html |archivedate=23 February 2007  }}</ref>\n\nStorylines throughout the decade included Elsie's mystery poison-pen letter, the 1962 marriage of Ken and [[Valerie Barlow|Valerie Tatlock]] ([[Anne Reid]]), [[Storylines of Coronation Street#Killing of Martha Longhurst|the death of Martha Longhurst]] in 1964, the birth of the Barlow twins in 1965, Elsie Tanner's wedding to [[Steve Tanner (Coronation Street)|Steve Tanner]] ([[Paul Maxwell (actor)|Paul Maxwell]]) and a train crashing from the viaduct (both in 1967), Steve Tanner's murder in 1968, and a coach crash in 1969.\n\nIn spite of rising popularity with viewers, ''Coronation Street'' was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban working class, and its representation of a community that was a [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] fantasy.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert C|last=Allen|title=Soap Opera|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|accessdate=7 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050523235035/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|archivedate=23 May 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref> After the first episode in 1960, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' printed: \"The programme is doomed from the outset&nbsp;...

Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including [[Lucille Hewitt]] ([[Jennifer Moss (actress)|Jennifer Moss]]) becoming addicted to drugs, [[Jerry Booth (Coronation Street)|Jerry Booth]] ([[Graham Haberfield]]) being in a storyline about homosexuality, [[Emily Nugent]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) having an out-of-wedlock child, and introducing a black family, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.<ref>Little.

(2000) p.86.</ref> The audience of ITV's other flagship soap opera ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' increased markedly at this time, as its established cast, such as Meg Richardson ([[Noele Gordon]]), grew in popularity.<ref name=\"littlepg86\"/> These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background. The roles of [[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]), [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Hunt]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]), [[Mavis Wilton|Mavis Riley]] ([[Thelma Barlow]]) and [[Ivy Tilsley|Ivy Tyldesley]] ([[Lynne Perrie]]) were built up between 1972 and 1973 (with Perrie's character being renamed to the better-known \"Tilsley\"), and characters such as [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Potter]] ([[Helen Worth]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Patricia Cutts]]/[[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]), and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Liz Dawn]]) first appearing in 1974.

(1995) p.131.</ref> ''Coronation Street's'' stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens' lodger, Gail Potter and [[Suzie Birchall]] ([[Cheryl Murray]]) moved in with Elsie, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff: Bet Lynch, Fred Gee and [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Turpin]] ([[Betty Driver]]).\n\nStorylines throughout the decade included a warehouse fire in 1975, the birth of [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy Langton]] in 1977, the murder of [[Ernest Bishop]] ([[Stephen Hancock]]) in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of Gail to [[Brian Tilsley]] ([[Christopher Quinten]]) (also in 1979).\n\nFor eleven weeks, between August and October 1979, [[industrial action]] forced ''Coronation Street'' and the entire ITV network (apart from the [[Channel Islands]]) off the air. When ITV did return, its first evening schedule included a special \"catch-up\" edition of ''Coronation Street''. This included storylines which would have taken place during the strike, and they were explained in the form of a narrative chat between Bet Lynch and popular character [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]). For several weeks the channel had very few fresh episodes to show, and episodes of the game show ''[[3-2-1]]'' were screened in its place. ''Coronation Street'' returned to ITV screens with a regular scheduled time closer to the end of 1979.\n\n''Coronation Street'' had little competition within its prime time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially viable storylines and again presenting a dated view of working class life.<ref>Liddement. (2004)</ref>\n\n===1980s===\nBetween 1980 and 1989, ''Coronation Street'' underwent some of the biggest changes since its launch. By May 1984, [[William Roache]] ([[Ken Barlow]]) stood as the only original [[cast member]], after the departures of [[Violet Carson]] ([[Ena Sharples]]) in 1980, [[Doris Speed]] ([[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]]) in 1983, and both [[Pat Phoenix]] ([[Elsie Tanner]]) and [[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]] ([[Albert Tatlock]]) in 1984.<ref>Little.

In 1983, [[Shirley Armitage]] (Lisa Lewis) became the first major black character in her role as machinist at Baldwin's Casuals.<ref name=\"little172\"/>\n\nKen Barlow married [[Deirdre Langton]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) on 27 July 1981.

(1995) pp.184, 189.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the arrival of [[Channel 4]], and its edgy new soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'', was one of the biggest changes for ''Coronation Street''. Unlike ''Coronation Street'', which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, ''Brookside'' brought together working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting, and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in ''Coronation Street'' were largely about family affairs, ''Brookside'' concentrated on social affairs such as [[industrial action]], unemployment, and the [[black market]]. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 1985.<ref name=\"littlepg165\">Little. (2000) p.165.</ref> Like ''Brookside'', ''EastEnders'' had a more gritty premise than ''Coronation Street'', although unlike ''Brookside'' it tended to steer clear of blue language and politicised stories.\n\nWhile ratings for ''Coronation Street'' remained consistent throughout the decade, ''[[EastEnders]]'' regularly obtained higher viewing figures due to its omnibus episodes shown at weekends.<ref>Little. (2000) p.170.</ref> The ''Coronation Street'' episode broadcast on 2 January 1985 attracted 21.40 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode in the shows history based on a single showing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/britains-most-watched-tv-show-of-last-80-years-revealed-10639498 |work=Sky News |title=Britain's most watched TV show of last 80 years |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> Subsequent episodes would achieve higher figures when the original broadcast and omnibus edition figures were combined. With prime time competition, ''Corrie'' was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being a failure with viewers.<ref name=\"littlepg165\" /> Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer [[David Liddiment]]. A new exterior set had been built in 1982, and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed with a new studio being built, and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved the show from being shot on film to [[videotape]] in 1988.<ref name=\"littlepg188\">Little. (2000) p.188.</ref> Due to new pressures, an introduction of the third weekly episode aired on 20 October 1989, to broadcast each Friday at 7:30&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"littlepg188\"/>\n\nThe 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as Deirdre Barlow's affair with [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention.<ref>Little. (1995) p.165.</ref> The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, [[Susan Barlow|Susan]] ([[Wendy Jane Walker]]). In 1986, there was a fire at the Rovers Return. The episode that aired on 25 December 1987, attracted a combined audience (original and omnibus) of 26.65&nbsp;million \u2013 a figure helped by the fact that this episode heralded the departure of immensely-popular character [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]). Between 1986 and 1989, the story of [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]]'s ([[Barbara Knox]]) [[psychological abuse]] at the hands of [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), and then his subsequent death under the wheels of a [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool tram]], was played out. This storyline gave the show its highest combined viewing figure in its history with 26.93&nbsp;million for the episode that aired on 15 (and 19) March 1989, where Alan is hiding from the police after trying to kill Rita in the previous episode. This rating is sometimes incorrectly credited to the 8 December 1989 tram death episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/television/tv-by-decade/tv-shows-1980s/1980s-television-introduction/ |work=Nostalgia Central |title=1980s Television |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> Other stories included the birth of [[Nick Tilsley|Nicky Tilsley]] ([[Warren Jackson]]) in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and [[Stan Ogden]]'s funeral in 1984, the birth of [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Tilsley]] (Lynsay King) in 1987, and [[Brian Tilsley]]'s murder in 1989.\n\nNew characters were introduced, such as [[Terry Duckworth]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]), [[Curly Watts]] ([[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]]), [[Martin Platt]] ([[Sean Wilson (actor)|Sean Wilson]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]), and the McDonald family; one of whom, [[Simon Gregson]], started on the show as [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]] a week after his 15th birthday, and has been on the show ever since.\n\n===1990s===\nIn spite of updated sets and production changes, ''Coronation Street'' still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Council]], [[Lord Rees-Mogg]], criticised the low representation of [[minority group|ethnic minorities]], and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as \"''Coronation Street'' shuts out blacks\" (''[[The Times]]''), and \"'Put colour in t'Street\" (''Daily Mirror'').<ref>Little. (1995) p.217.</ref> [[Patrick Stoddart]] of ''The Times'' wrote: \"The millions who watch ''Coronation Street''&nbsp;\u2013 and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg&nbsp;\u2013 know real life when they see it&nbsp;... in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen\".<ref>Little. (2000) p.205.</ref> Black and Asian characters had appeared, but it was not until 1999 that the show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family. There was also an Irish Traveller family who made a brief appearance for 4 episodes \u2013 spear headed by famous Irish actress Rachael McCrudden who played the part of Josie Joyce and her husband Conor McCrudden ( Jonjo Joyce). They were written off after they went on a rampage of drinking Dutch Gold and were caught by police after holding up the local Des Kelly carpets looking for wet finish Lino.\n\nNew characters [[Des Barnes|Des]] ([[Philip Middlemiss]]) and Steph Barnes ([[Amelia Bullmore]]) moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as [[Yuppie]]s.<ref>Little.

She made brief return appearances in 1999, 2002 and 2003.\n\nIn 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day, he cut the characters of [[Derek Wilton]] ([[Peter Baldwin (actor)|Peter Baldwin]]), [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street Character)|Don Brennan]] ([[Geoffrey Hinsliff]]), [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]), [[Bill Webster]] ([[Peter Armitage]]), [[Billy Williams (Coronation Street)|Billy Williams]] ([[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]]) and [[Maureen Holdsworth]] ([[Sherrie Hewson]]).<ref name=\"littlepg235\">Little.

Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as drug dealers, eco-warriors, religious cults, and a transsexual woman.<ref name=\"little241\">Little.

Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off before the end of the 1970s, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series. In 2011, [[Dennis Tanner]] ([[Philip Lowrie]]), another character from the first episode, returned to ''Coronation Street'' after a 43-year absence. Since 1984, Ken Barlow has been the show's only remaining original character. Emily Bishop ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) had appeared in the series since late-January 1961, when the show was just weeks old, and was the show's longest-serving female character before she departed on 1 January 2016.

Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran such as [[Albert Tatlock]] ([[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]), [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]) and [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]), the bumbling retail manager like [[Leonard Swindley]] ([[Arthur Lowe]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]), [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]), quick-tempered, tough tradesmen like [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]), [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]] ([[Charles Lawson]]), [[Tommy Harris (Coronation Street)|Tommy Harris]] ([[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]]) and [[Owen Armstrong]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]), and the perennial losers such as Stan and Hilda, Jack and Vera, [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), [[Beth Tinker]] ([[Lisa George]]) and [[Kirk Sutherland]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]).<ref name=\"littlepg7\">Little.

The show's former archivist and scriptwriter [[Daran Little]] disagreed with the characterisation of the show as a collection of stereotypes. \"Rather, remember that Elsie, Ena and others were the first of their kind ever seen on British television.

Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This instalment featured the street's residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the end, suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like [[BBC1]], the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.\n\nThe ITV network, like [[BBC1]], began full colour transmissions on 15 November 1969.

The trio were likened to the [[Greek chorus]], and the [[Weird Sisters|three witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', as they would sit in the [[The snug|snug bar]] of [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]], passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.<ref>Tinker. p. 31.</ref> Headstrong Ena often clashed with [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Pat Phoenix]]), whom she believed espoused a dauntlessly loose set of morals.

The roles of [[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]), [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Hunt]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]), [[Mavis Wilton|Mavis Riley]] ([[Thelma Barlow]]) and [[Ivy Tilsley|Ivy Tyldesley]] ([[Lynne Perrie]]) were built up between 1972 and 1973 (with Perrie's character being renamed to the better-known \"Tilsley\"), and characters such as [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Potter]] ([[Helen Worth]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Patricia Cutts]]/[[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]), and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Liz Dawn]]) first appearing in 1974.

(1995) p.131.</ref> ''Coronation Street's'' stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens' lodger, Gail Potter and [[Suzie Birchall]] ([[Cheryl Murray]]) moved in with Elsie, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff: Bet Lynch, Fred Gee and [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Turpin]] ([[Betty Driver]]).\n\nStorylines throughout the decade included a warehouse fire in 1975, the birth of [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy Langton]] in 1977, the murder of [[Ernest Bishop]] ([[Stephen Hancock]]) in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of Gail to [[Brian Tilsley]] ([[Christopher Quinten]]) (also in 1979).\n\nFor eleven weeks, between August and October 1979, [[industrial action]] forced ''Coronation Street'' and the entire ITV network (apart from the [[Channel Islands]]) off the air. When ITV did return, its first evening schedule included a special \"catch-up\" edition of ''Coronation Street''. This included storylines which would have taken place during the strike, and they were explained in the form of a narrative chat between Bet Lynch and popular character [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]). For several weeks the channel had very few fresh episodes to show, and episodes of the game show ''[[3-2-1]]'' were screened in its place. ''Coronation Street'' returned to ITV screens with a regular scheduled time closer to the end of 1979.\n\n''Coronation Street'' had little competition within its prime time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially viable storylines and again presenting a dated view of working class life.<ref>Liddement.

(1995) pp.184, 189.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the arrival of [[Channel 4]], and its edgy new soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'', was one of the biggest changes for ''Coronation Street''. Unlike ''Coronation Street'', which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, ''Brookside'' brought together working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting, and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in ''Coronation Street'' were largely about family affairs, ''Brookside'' concentrated on social affairs such as [[industrial action]], unemployment, and the [[black market]]. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 1985.<ref name=\"littlepg165\">Little. (2000) p.165.</ref> Like ''Brookside'', ''EastEnders'' had a more gritty premise than ''Coronation Street'', although unlike ''Brookside'' it tended to steer clear of blue language and politicised stories.\n\nWhile ratings for ''Coronation Street'' remained consistent throughout the decade, ''[[EastEnders]]'' regularly obtained higher viewing figures due to its omnibus episodes shown at weekends.<ref>Little. (2000) p.170.</ref> The ''Coronation Street'' episode broadcast on 2 January 1985 attracted 21.40 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode in the shows history based on a single showing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/britains-most-watched-tv-show-of-last-80-years-revealed-10639498 |work=Sky News |title=Britain's most watched TV show of last 80 years |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> Subsequent episodes would achieve higher figures when the original broadcast and omnibus edition figures were combined. With prime time competition, ''Corrie'' was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being a failure with viewers.<ref name=\"littlepg165\" /> Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer [[David Liddiment]]. A new exterior set had been built in 1982, and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed with a new studio being built, and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved the show from being shot on film to [[videotape]] in 1988.<ref name=\"littlepg188\">Little. (2000) p.188.</ref> Due to new pressures, an introduction of the third weekly episode aired on 20 October 1989, to broadcast each Friday at 7:30&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"littlepg188\"/>\n\nThe 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as Deirdre Barlow's affair with [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention.<ref>Little. (1995) p.165.</ref> The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, [[Susan Barlow|Susan]] ([[Wendy Jane Walker]]). In 1986, there was a fire at the Rovers Return. The episode that aired on 25 December 1987, attracted a combined audience (original and omnibus) of 26.65&nbsp;million \u2013 a figure helped by the fact that this episode heralded the departure of immensely-popular character [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]). Between 1986 and 1989, the story of [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]]'s ([[Barbara Knox]]) [[psychological abuse]] at the hands of [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), and then his subsequent death under the wheels of a [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool tram]], was played out. This storyline gave the show its highest combined viewing figure in its history with 26.93&nbsp;million for the episode that aired on 15 (and 19) March 1989, where Alan is hiding from the police after trying to kill Rita in the previous episode. This rating is sometimes incorrectly credited to the 8 December 1989 tram death episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/television/tv-by-decade/tv-shows-1980s/1980s-television-introduction/ |work=Nostalgia Central |title=1980s Television |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> Other stories included the birth of [[Nick Tilsley|Nicky Tilsley]] ([[Warren Jackson]]) in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and [[Stan Ogden]]'s funeral in 1984, the birth of [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Tilsley]] (Lynsay King) in 1987, and [[Brian Tilsley]]'s murder in 1989.\n\nNew characters were introduced, such as [[Terry Duckworth]] ([[Nigel Pivaro]]), [[Curly Watts]] ([[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]]), [[Martin Platt]] ([[Sean Wilson (actor)|Sean Wilson]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]), and the McDonald family; one of whom, [[Simon Gregson]], started on the show as [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]] a week after his 15th birthday, and has been on the show ever since.\n\n===1990s===\nIn spite of updated sets and production changes, ''Coronation Street'' still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Council]], [[Lord Rees-Mogg]], criticised the low representation of [[minority group|ethnic minorities]], and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as \"''Coronation Street'' shuts out blacks\" (''[[The Times]]''), and \"'Put colour in t'Street\" (''Daily Mirror'').<ref>Little. (1995) p.217.</ref> [[Patrick Stoddart]] of ''The Times'' wrote: \"The millions who watch ''Coronation Street''&nbsp;\u2013 and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg&nbsp;\u2013 know real life when they see it&nbsp;... in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen\".<ref>Little.

There was also an Irish Traveller family who made a brief appearance for 4 episodes \u2013 spear headed by famous Irish actress Rachael McCrudden who played the part of Josie Joyce and her husband Conor McCrudden ( Jonjo Joyce). They were written off after they went on a rampage of drinking Dutch Gold and were caught by police after holding up the local Des Kelly carpets looking for wet finish Lino.\n\nNew characters [[Des Barnes|Des]] ([[Philip Middlemiss]]) and Steph Barnes ([[Amelia Bullmore]]) moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as [[Yuppie]]s.<ref>Little.

She made brief return appearances in 1999, 2002 and 2003.\n\nIn 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day, he cut the characters of [[Derek Wilton]] ([[Peter Baldwin (actor)|Peter Baldwin]]), [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street Character)|Don Brennan]] ([[Geoffrey Hinsliff]]), [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]), [[Bill Webster]] ([[Peter Armitage]]), [[Billy Williams (Coronation Street)|Billy Williams]] ([[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]]) and [[Maureen Holdsworth]] ([[Sherrie Hewson]]).<ref name=\"littlepg235\">Little.

Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as drug dealers, eco-warriors, religious cults, and a transsexual woman.<ref name=\"little241\">Little.

Having received criticism of being too out of touch, ''Corrie'' now struggled to emulate the more modern ''Brookside'' and ''EastEnders''.

The original cast was created by Tony Warren, with the characters of [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]), [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Pat Phoenix]]) and [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]] ([[Doris Speed]]) as central figures.<ref>Little.

Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off before the end of the 1970s, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series. In 2011, [[Dennis Tanner]] ([[Philip Lowrie]]), another character from the first episode, returned to ''Coronation Street'' after a 43-year absence. Since 1984, Ken Barlow has been the show's only remaining original character. Emily Bishop ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]) had appeared in the series since late-January 1961, when the show was just weeks old, and was the show's longest-serving female character before she departed on 1 January 2016. Rita Tanner ([[Barbara Knox]]) appeared on the show for one episode in December 1964, before returning as a full-time cast member in January 1972. She is currently the second longest-serving original cast member on the show.\n\nStan and Hilda Ogden were introduced in 1964, with Hilda becoming one of the most famous British soap opera characters of all time.

Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran such as [[Albert Tatlock]] ([[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]), [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]) and [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]), the bumbling retail manager like [[Leonard Swindley]] ([[Arthur Lowe]]), [[Reg Holdsworth]] ([[Ken Morley]]), [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]), quick-tempered, tough tradesmen like [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]), [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]] ([[Charles Lawson]]), [[Tommy Harris (Coronation Street)|Tommy Harris]] ([[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]]) and [[Owen Armstrong]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]), and the perennial losers such as Stan and Hilda, Jack and Vera, [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), [[Beth Tinker]] ([[Lisa George]]) and [[Kirk Sutherland]] ([[Andrew Whyment]]).<ref name=\"littlepg7\">Little.

The show's former archivist and scriptwriter [[Daran Little]] disagreed with the characterisation of the show as a collection of stereotypes. \"Rather, remember that Elsie, Ena and others were the first of their kind ever seen on British television.

Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This instalment featured the street's residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the end, suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like [[BBC1]], the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.\n\nThe ITV network, like [[BBC1]], began full colour transmissions on 15 November 1969. Daran Little, for many years the official programme archivist, claims that the first episode to be transmitted in colour was episode 930 shown on 24 November 1969.<ref>Little.

The terms of the work-to-rule were that staff refused to work with the new equipment (though the old black and white equipment had been disposed of by then) and therefore programmes were recorded and transmitted in black and white, including ''Coronation Street''<ref>Richard Marson. \"Inside Updown&nbsp;\u2013 the story of \"Upstairs Downstairs\".
