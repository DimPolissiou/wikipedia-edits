The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

It was completed in 1935. In 2001, it was renamed after [[Robert F. Kennedy]] the 64th Attorney General of the United States.\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Front of Department of Justice Building.JPG|200px|thumb|left|South front of the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building]] \nThe Office of the Attorney General was created by the [[1st United States Congress]] by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]].<ref name=\"GSA\"/> In 1792, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] made the Attorney General a [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]-level post.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> In 1870, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed the bill creating the Department of Justice.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> Still, there was not yet a permanent home for either the Attorney General or the Justice Department, and each had occupied a succession of temporary spaces in [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] buildings and privately owned [[office building]]s.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> While plans to provide the Department with its own building were developed as early as 1910, it was not until the late 1920s that significant progress was made toward this goal.<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\nIn 1908 and in 1928, Congress authorized the purchase of land in what is now known as the [[Federal Triangle]] for departmental offices.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> The authorization was part of a wave of government construction; the 1926 Public Buildings Act permitted the government to hire private [[architect]]s for the [[Building design|design]] of federal buildings, which led to large-scale construction of public buildings, including the development of the 70 acre Federal Triangle site between the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] and the [[White House]].<ref name=\"GSA\"/> [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Andrew W. Mellon]] and the Board of Architectural Consultants, composed of leading architects and headed by [[Edward H. Bennett]] of the [[Chicago]] [[architectural firm]] of Bennett, [[William E. Parsons|Parsons]] & [[Harry T. Frost|Frost]], developed design guidelines for the site.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> Under Bennett's direction, each member of the board designed one of the buildings in the Federal Triangle complex to \"provide each government agency or bureau with a building that would address its functional needs, while combining the individual buildings into a harmonious, monumental overall design expressive of the dignity and authority of the federal government.\"<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\n[[Image:Dept of Justice.jpg|200px|thumb|right|10th. St. NW facade of the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building from [[Constitution Avenue]].]]\n[[Milton Bennett Medary]] of the [[Philadelphia]] firm [[Zantzinger, Borie & Medary]] was selected as the architect for the Department of Justice Building; upon Medary's death in 1929, the project was taken over by his two partners [[Charles L. Borie, Jr.]] and [[Clarence C. Zantzinger]].<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\nIn 1930, Congress [[Appropriation bill|appropriated]] $10 million for the construction of a permanent Department of Justice headquarters in the Federal Triangle.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> The building was constructed from 1931 to 1934.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> Upon completion in 1935, the building finally provided a headquarters for the Attorney General and Department of Justice.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> From 1935 to 1941 68 [[mural]]s were painted in the building (an example of [[New Deal]] art).<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\n===Post-construction===\nIn 1966, the Department of Justice building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as part of the [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site]].<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\nIn 1974, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], which had been headquartered in the same building, moved into its own headquarters at the [[J. Edgar Hoover Building]] across the street on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nIn 1978, the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC) was established after the passage of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]]. The court of 11 judges appointed by the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] (increased from seven by the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]) meets in secret.\n\n===Renovations===\nFrom March 1998 to January 2006,<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> major [[renovation]]s to the building took place, including work on [[plumbing]], [[electrical wiring]], [[HVAC|heating and cooling]], and [[elevator]]s. The project included replication of original lighting for the building's corridors and other ornamental spaces.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> A new $3.1 million [[conference center]] and \"data room\" were built, the main library and executive suites were restored, and a new [[Architectural engineering|mechanical, electrical and plumbing]] (MEP) system was installed.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/>\n\nThe project's submitting firm and [[Construction management|construction manager]] was the Gilbane Building Company, the architectural firm was Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann Associates, the [[structural engineering]] firm was Delon Hampton Associates, and the [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]]/[[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] was H.F. Lenz Company.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/>\n\nSeveral difficulties were present: The building had to remain operational during renovations, and [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] were involved, with a large-scale [[asbestos abatement]] effort, [[lead paint]] removal, and the handling of [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s with [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]. The Gilbane Building Company established a \"stop-work\" rule to halt construction when hazardous material was discovered.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> An additional complication was security concerns, because of [[Information sensitivity|sensitive]] and [[classified information]] in the building. According to ''Building Design & Construction'', construction personnel were \"classified into three tiers and were permitted access to specific building areas based on these three levels of [[security clearance]].\"<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> The extensive murals, [[sculpture]]s, and [[plaster]] [[relief]]s in the building were protected with shields during the construction, and [[temperature]], [[humidity]], and [[dust]] controls were installed.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/>\n\nThe cost of the renovations was $142 million, but the project came in $4.2 million under budget, in part due to significant [[Architectural conservation|conservation]] efforts.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> Design consultants decided to renovate [[courtyard]] [[plaza]] and [[Parking garage|garage]] structures instead of [[Demolition|demolishing]] them, using 95 percent of existing materials.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> [[Cobblestone]] blocks in the courtyard were \"removed, cleaned, refurbished, and reinstalled,\" with \"the foundation of the courtyard's original [[fountain]]\" being preserved and its [[Water pipe|pipes]] and [[pump]]s replaced.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> Further, only the [[concrete]] of \"questionable integrity around the facility's garage beams\" was repaired, instead of having all the concrete replaced.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> For the plaza deck, the integrity of the concrete structure was tested. Some sections were found to be repairable, preventing them from being rebuilt and diverting 14,520 tons of waste from [[landfill]].<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> Finally, the original foundation and structure building was preserved, which saved 110 tons of waste material and decreased \"the risk of penetrating a sensitive [[waterproofing]] membrane system.\"<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> Additional costs were saved through \"early buyout\": \"taking advantage of the purchasing power of the entire four-phase construction job,\" the construction management firm \"was able to secure prices early on in the project that otherwise would have been spent covering the escalating costs of [[building material]]s.\"<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/>\n\nThese measures allowed the GSA to carry out additional work: \"restoration and [[repointing]] of the limestone exterior,\" repair and replacement of the roof, restoration of \"ornate painting and plaster,\" further hazardous materials abatement, and [[Fire safety|fire code]] upgrades.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> Ultimately close to $1 million was returned to the GSA.\n\n===Renaming===\n[[File:BushDedicatingRFKJusticeDepartmentBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|President George W.

Paul Jennewein]] and Warren Straton were selected to create a unified design concept for the building's exterior and interior spaces, designing 57 sculptural elements for the building. Their work ranged from the carved limestone figures for the [[pediment]]s on the Constitution Avenue facade, to the aluminum Art Deco torchieres and light fixtures throughout the interior.<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\nThe interior of the U.S. Department of Justice building contains many decorative wall paintings.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> The building's extensive murals depict scenes of daily life from throughout [[History of the United States|American history]] and symbolic interpretations or [[Allegory|allegories]] relating to the role of [[justice]] in American society.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> In all, 68 murals were completed between 1935 and 1941, at a cost of $68,000, one percent of the cost of the building.<ref name=\"GSA\"/>  Mural artists include [[George Biddle]], [[Henry Varnum Poor (designer)|Henry Varnum Poor]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Boardman Robinson]], and [[Leon Kroll]].\n\nThe striking, colorful [[concrete]] [[mosaic]]s on the ceilings of the vehicular and pedestrian entryways from 9th and 10th Streets were created by the Washington, D.C. master craftsman [[John Joseph Earley]], an innovator in the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] applications of the material.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> Visible from the street, these mosaics retain much of the brilliance of their original colors.<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\nA sculpture of the Revolutionary War hero [[Nathan Hale]] by [[Bela Pratt]] stands on the southern side of the building.\n\n===''Spirit of Justice''===\n''[[Spirit of Justice]]'' is a cast aluminum Art Deco statue designed by Jennewein.

Unlike many representations of Lady Justice, ''Spirit of Justice'' wears no [[blindfold]] to symbolize [[Blind justice (concept)|blind justice]]. The statue measures 12.5 feet (150&nbsp;inches) and was [[Commission (art)|commissioned]] in 1933 at a cost of $7000, and has stood with ''Majesty of Law'' in the Great Hall since 1936.<ref name=\"Eggen\">{{cite news|last=Eggen|first=Dan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/24/AR2005062401797.html|title=Sculpted Bodies And a Strip Act At Justice Dept|work=The Washington Post|date=June 25, 2005|page=A02}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the statue was seen behind then\u2013Attorney General [[Edwin Meese]] during a [[press conference]] as he discussed the final report of the [[Attorney General's Commission on Pornography]] (Meese Report).

It was completed in 1935. In 2001, it was renamed after [[Robert F. Kennedy]] the 64th Attorney General of the United States.\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Front of Department of Justice Building.JPG|200px|thumb|left|South front of the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building]] \nThe Office of the Attorney General was created by the [[1st United States Congress]] by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]].<ref name=\"GSA\"/> In 1792, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] made the Attorney General a [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]-level post.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> In 1870, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed the bill creating the Department of Justice.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> Still, there was not yet a permanent home for either the Attorney General or the Justice Department, and each had occupied a succession of temporary spaces in [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] buildings and privately owned [[office building]]s.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> While plans to provide the Department with its own building were developed as early as 1910, it was not until the late 1920s that significant progress was made toward this goal.<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\nIn 1908 and in 1928, Congress authorized the purchase of land in what is now known as the [[Federal Triangle]] for departmental offices.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> The authorization was part of a wave of government construction; the 1926 Public Buildings Act permitted the government to hire private [[architect]]s for the [[Building design|design]] of federal buildings, which led to large-scale construction of public buildings, including the development of the 70 acre Federal Triangle site between the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] and the [[White House]].<ref name=\"GSA\"/> [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Andrew W. Mellon]] and the Board of Architectural Consultants, composed of leading architects and headed by [[Edward H. Bennett]] of the [[Chicago]] [[architectural firm]] of Bennett, [[William E. Parsons|Parsons]] & [[Harry T. Frost|Frost]], developed design guidelines for the site.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> Under Bennett's direction, each member of the board designed one of the buildings in the Federal Triangle complex to \"provide each government agency or bureau with a building that would address its functional needs, while combining the individual buildings into a harmonious, monumental overall design expressive of the dignity and authority of the federal government.\"<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\n[[Image:Dept of Justice.jpg|200px|thumb|right|10th. St. NW facade of the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building from [[Constitution Avenue]].]]\n[[Milton Bennett Medary]] of the [[Philadelphia]] firm [[Zantzinger, Borie & Medary]] was selected as the architect for the Department of Justice Building; upon Medary's death in 1929, the project was taken over by his two partners [[Charles L. Borie, Jr.]] and [[Clarence C. Zantzinger]].<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\nIn 1930, Congress [[Appropriation bill|appropriated]] $10 million for the construction of a permanent Department of Justice headquarters in the Federal Triangle.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> The building was constructed from 1931 to 1934.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> Upon completion in 1935, the building finally provided a headquarters for the Attorney General and Department of Justice.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> From 1935 to 1941 68 [[mural]]s were painted in the building (an example of [[New Deal]] art).<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\n===Post-construction===\nIn 1966, the Department of Justice building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as part of the [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site]].<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\nIn 1974, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], which had been headquartered in the same building, moved into its own headquarters at the [[J. Edgar Hoover Building]] across the street on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nIn 1978, the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC) was established after the passage of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]]. The court of 11 judges appointed by the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] (increased from seven by the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]) meets in secret.\n\n===Renovations===\nFrom March 1998 to January 2006,<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> major [[renovation]]s to the building took place, including work on [[plumbing]], [[electrical wiring]], [[HVAC|heating and cooling]], and [[elevator]]s. The project included replication of original lighting for the building's corridors and other ornamental spaces.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> A new $3.1 Million [[conference center]] and \"data room\" were built, the main library and executive suites were restored, and a new [[Architectural engineering|mechanical, electrical and plumbing]] (MEP) system was installed.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/>\n\nThe project's submitting firm and [[Construction management|construction manager]] was the Gilbane Building Company, the architectural firm was Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann Associates, the [[structural engineering]] firm was Delon Hampton Associates, and the [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]]/[[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] was H.F. Lenz Company.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/>\n\nSeveral difficulties were present: The building had to remain operational during renovations, and [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] were involved, with a large-scale [[asbestos abatement]] effort, [[lead paint]] removal, and the handling of [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s with [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]. The Gilbane Building Company established a \"stop-work\" rule to halt construction when hazardous material was discovered.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> An additional complication was security concerns, because of [[Information sensitivity|sensitive]] and [[classified information]] in the building. According to ''Building Design & Construction'', construction personnel were \"classified into three tiers and were permitted access to specific building areas based on these three levels of [[security clearance]].\"<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> The extensive murals, [[sculpture]]s, and [[plaster]] [[relief]]s in the building were protected with shields during the construction, and [[temperature]], [[humidity]], and [[dust]] controls were installed.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/>\n\nThe cost of the renovations was $142 Million, but the project came in $4.2 Million under budget, in part due to significant [[Architectural conservation|conservation]] efforts.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> Design consultants decided to renovate [[courtyard]] [[plaza]] and [[Parking garage|garage]] structures instead of [[Demolition|demolishing]] them, using 95 percent of existing materials.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> [[Cobblestone]] blocks in the courtyard were \"removed, cleaned, refurbished, and reinstalled,\" with \"the foundation of the courtyard's original [[fountain]]\" being preserved and its [[Water pipe|pipes]] and [[pump]]s replaced.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> Further, only the [[concrete]] of \"questionable integrity around the facility's garage beams\" was repaired, instead of having all the concrete replaced.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> For the plaza deck, the integrity of the concrete structure was tested. Some sections were found to be repairable, preventing them from being rebuilt and diverting 14,520 tons of waste from [[landfill]].<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> Finally, the original foundation and structure building was preserved, which saved 110 tons of waste material and decreased \"the risk of penetrating a sensitive [[waterproofing]] membrane system.\"<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> Additional costs were saved through \"early buyout\": \"taking advantage of the purchasing power of the entire four-phase construction job,\" the construction management firm \"was able to secure prices early on in the project that otherwise would have been spent covering the escalating costs of [[building material]]s.\"<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/>\n\nThese measures allowed the GSA to carry out additional work: \"restoration and [[repointing]] of the limestone exterior,\" repair and replacement of the roof, restoration of \"ornate painting and plaster,\" further hazardous materials abatement, and [[Fire safety|fire code]] upgrades.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> Ultimately close to $1 Million was returned to the GSA.\n\n===Renaming===\n[[File:BushDedicatingRFKJusticeDepartmentBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|President George W. Bush renames Justice Department building in honor of Robert Kennedy]]\nIn 2001, the '''Department of Justice Main Building''' was renamed the '''Robert F.

Kennedy Department of Justice Building is, \"Justice is founded in the rights bestowed by nature upon man. Liberty is maintained in security of justice.\"\n\nIt is distinguished from other Federal Triangle buildings by Art Deco elements and the innovative use of [[aluminum]] for details that were traditionally [[Casting|cast]] in [[bronze]].<ref name=\"GSA\"/> All entrances to the building feature {{convert|20|ft|m|sing=on}}-high aluminum [[door]]s that slide into recessed pockets. Interior [[Handrail|stair railings]], [[grillwork]], and door trim are aluminum, as are Art Deco [[torchiere]]s, doors for the building's 25 [[elevator]]s, and more than 10,000 [[light fixture]]s.<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\nThe building has many distinctive interior spaces, including the Great Hall [[Foyer|entry foyer]] and the [[Law library|Law Library]].<ref name=\"GSA\"/> The two-story Great Hall features Art Deco light fixtures and a [[terra cotta|terra-cotta]] tile floor with gray [[marble]] borders.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> The Law Library, located on the fifth floor, is a two-story room distinguished by a pair of tall Art Deco lights and a 20-panel mural by [[Maurice Sterne]].<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\n==Art==\nThe building contains the largest historic [[Collection (museum)|art collection]] of any General Services Administration\u2013built facility.<ref name=\"Horwitz-Bennett\"/> [[Sculpture]] is integrated into the fabric of the building.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> Sculptors [[C. Paul Jennewein]] and Warren Straton were selected to create a unified design concept for the building's exterior and interior spaces, designing 57 sculptural elements for the building. Their work ranged from the carved limestone figures for the [[pediment]]s on the Constitution Avenue facade, to the aluminum Art Deco torchieres and light fixtures throughout the interior.<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\nThe interior of the U.S. Department of Justice building contains many decorative wall paintings.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> The building's extensive murals depict scenes of daily life from throughout [[History of the United States|American history]] and symbolic interpretations or [[Allegory|allegories]] relating to the role of [[justice]] in American society.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> In all, 68 murals were completed between 1935 and 1941, at a cost of $68,000, one percent of the cost of the building.<ref name=\"GSA\"/>  Mural artists include [[George Biddle]], [[Henry Varnum Poor (designer)|Henry Varnum Poor]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Boardman Robinson]], and [[Leon Kroll]].\n\nThe striking, colorful [[concrete]] [[mosaic]]s on the ceilings of the vehicular and pedestrian entryways from 9th and 10th Streets were created by the Washington, D.C. master craftsman [[John Joseph Earley]], an innovator in the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] applications of the material.<ref name=\"GSA\"/> Visible from the street, these mosaics retain much of the brilliance of their original colors.<ref name=\"GSA\"/>\n\nA sculpture of the Revolutionary War hero [[Nathan Hale]] by [[Bela Pratt]] stands on the southern side of the building.\n\n===''Spirit of Justice''===\n''[[Spirit of Justice]]'' is a cast aluminum Art Deco statue designed by Jennewein. It depicts [[Lady Justice]] (a woman wearing a [[toga]]-like dress with one [[breast]] revealed and arms raised) and stands on display along with its male counterpart ''Majesty of Law'' in the Great Hall. Unlike many representations of Lady Justice, ''Spirit of Justice'' wears no [[blindfold]] to symbolize [[Blind justice (concept)|blind justice]]. The statue measures 12.5 feet (150&nbsp;inches) and was [[Commission (art)|commissioned]] in 1933 at a cost of $7000, and has stood with ''Majesty of Law'' in the Great Hall since 1936.<ref name=\"Eggen\">{{cite news|last=Eggen|first=Dan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/24/AR2005062401797.html|title=Sculpted Bodies And a Strip Act At Justice Dept|work=The Washington Post|date=June 25, 2005|page=A02}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the statue was seen behind then\u2013Attorney General [[Edwin Meese]] during a [[press conference]] as he discussed the final report of the [[Attorney General's Commission on Pornography]] (Meese Report).

Under Ashcroft the department had previously rented blue drapes at a cost of $2,000 every time the agency had a formal event.<ref name=\"EdwinMeese\"/> [[ABC News]] reported that Attorney General John Ashcroft had ordered the statues covered because he did not like being photographed in front of them, but Hix insisted that the Attorney General was not aware of the change and that the nudity on the statue was not the reason for the purchase, citing instead \"aesthetic\" reasons, such as the background for television cameras.<ref name=\"EdwinMeese\"/><ref name=\"BBC\">\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1788845.stm  Curtains for semi-nude justice statue].\" BBC. 29 Jan. 2002.</ref> Later, however, internal e-mails surface referred to \"hiding the statues\" and \"the episode was quickly seized upon by [[Pundit (expert)|pundits]] and [[Satire|satirists]] as a symbol of Ashcroft's allegedly [[puritan]]ical and [[Censorship|censorious]] bearing.\"<ref name=\"Eggen\"/> Journalist and writer Claire Braz-Valentine wrote an open lyrical letter to Ashcroft, which included the lines \"John, John, John,/you've got your priorities all wrong.\"<ref>Braz-Valentine, Claire. \"An Open Letter to John Ashcroft, Attorney General of the United States.\" Common Dreams. 11 June 2002.</ref>\n\nAshcroft joked about the incident on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in April 2002.<ref name=\"Eggen\"/> In May 2007, the \"Inside Washington\" column in ''[[National Journal]]'' reported that [[Monica Goodling]], a former aide to Ashcroft, was responsible for the covering of the statue.<ref name=\"NationalJournal\">\"Murmurs.\" ''National Journal'' 39.18 (5 May 2007).</ref>\n\nThe curtains were removed on June 24, 2005, under Ashcroft's successor [[Alberto Gonzales]].
