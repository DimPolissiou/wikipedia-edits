Motions at sonic speeds or below are made by a [[electric motor|motor]].  In the case of [[ultrasonic toothbrush]]es, [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] motions are produced by a [[piezoelectric crystal]]. A modern electric toothbrush is usually powered by a [[rechargeable battery]] charged through [[inductive charging]] when the brush sits in the charging base between uses.\n\nElectric toothbrushes can be classified according to the [[frequency]] (speed) of their movements as power, sonic or [[ultrasonic toothbrush]]es, depending on whether they make movements that are below, in or above the [[audible range]] (20\u201320,000&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] or 2400\u20132,400,000 movements per minute), respectively.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Motodent-electric-toothbrush.jpg|thumb|right|270px|A Motodent electric toothbrush.

The device plugged into a standard wall outlet and ran on line voltage. Electric toothbrushes were initially created for patients with limited motor skills and for orthodontic patients (such as those with braces).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Sean S.|title=Breath : causes, diagnosis and treatment of oral malodor|date=2009|publisher=Culminare, Inc.|location=San Bernardino, CA|isbn=978-1607259732|page=103|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKWEGOzGz7MC|accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Broxo Electric Toothbrush was introduced in the U.S. by [[E.

The GE Automatic Toothbrush came with a charging stand which held the hand piece upright; most units were kept in the charger, which is not the best way to get maximum service life from a NiCad battery. Also, early NiCad batteries tended to have a short lifespan. The batteries were sealed inside the GE device, and the whole unit had to be discarded when the batteries failed.\n\nThe use of an AC line voltage appliance in a bathroom environment was problematic. By the early 1990s [[Underwriter Laboratories]] (UL) and [[Canadian Standards Association]] (CSA) no longer certified line-voltage appliances for bathroom use. Newer appliances had to use a step-down [[transformer]] to operate the actual toothbrush at low voltage (typically 12, 16 or 24 volts). Wiring standards in many countries require that outlets in bath areas must be protected by a [[Residual-current device|RCD/GFCI]] device (e.g., required in USA since the 1970s on bathroom outlets in new construction).\n\nBy the 1990s there were problems with safety certification of Broxo's original design. Further, improved battery-operated toothbrushes were providing formidable competition.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe first [[ultrasonic toothbrush]], first called the Ultima and later the Ultrasonex, was patented in the U.S. in 1992, the same year the [[FDA]] gave it approval for daily home use.

Most manufacturers recommend that heads be changed every three to six months at minimum, or as soon as the brush head has visibly deteriorated.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== Power source and charging ==\nModern electric toothbrushes run on low voltage, 12\u00a0V or less. A few units use a step-down [[transformer]] to power the brush, but most use a battery, usually but not always rechargeable and non-replaceable, fitted inside the handle, which is hermetically sealed to prevent water damage. While early NiCd battery toothbrushes used metal tabs to connect with the charging base, some toothbrushes use [[inductive charging]].\n\n== Environmental concerns ==\nAccording to [[Friends of the Earth]], \"Disposable electric toothbrushes are one example of a terrible product ... it's virtually impossible to separate out the tech from the batteries and plastic casing which means valuable and often toxic materials are dumped in landfill or burnt in incinerators.\"<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|last1=Kleinman|first1=Zoe|title=Ikea unveils phone-charging furniture at MWC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31693088|accessdate=2 March 2015|work=[[BBC]]|date=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Optional features ==\n\n=== Timer ===\nMany modern electric toothbrushes have a timer which buzzes, or briefly interrupts power, typically after two minutes, and sometimes every 30 seconds. This is associated with a customary recommendation to brush for two minutes, 30 seconds for each of the four quadrants of the mouth.\n\n=== Display ===\nSome electric toothbrushes have [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] screens which show brushing time and sometimes smiley face [[icon (computing)|icon]]s or other images to encourage optimal brushing. These features could encourage people to brush more accurately.<ref name=\"Daniel E. Jolly, Professor of Clinical Dentistry College of Dentistry\nThe Ohio State University.\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100404123609/http://www.netwellness.org/healthtopics/dentistry/faq2.cfm Dental and Oral Health (Adults) Don't Let a Disability Keep the Dentist Away] \u2014 Daniel E. Jolly, Professor of Clinical Dentistry College of Dentistry The Ohio State University.</ref><ref name=\"The Smile Team Dental Centre Balwyn North\"/>\n\n=== Pressure sensor ===\nBrushing teeth too hard causes enamel and gum damage. Most modern top-end sonic toothbrushes come with a pressure sensor, which prevents users from brushing too aggressively. There are two types of pressure sensors. Some sensors produce a sound warning and some immediately stop movements of the sonic toothbrush when it is used too aggressively.\n\n=== Ultrasound indicator ===\nBecause of the fact that ultrasonic frequencies are beyond the [[audible range]] and the amplitude of movement emitted by an ultrasonic toothbrush is typically too small to be perceived, the ultrasound is imperceptible to humans and it may not be apparent that a brush running in pure ultrasound is turned on. Ultrasonic toothbrushes may include an indicator to notify the patient that ultrasound is being emitted.\n\n=== Bluetooth ===\n\n[[Bluetooth]] connectivity enables data to be transmitted from an electric toothbrush to another Bluetooth device, such as a smartphone. The brush can send data to an app, such as how long it has been brushing for and if too much pressure has been applied when brushing. The app can in turn send data back to the brush such as changing the cleaning modes available, and cleaning time.\nThe sharing of data between toothbrush and smartphone is intended to assist the user in creating better brushing technique and habits.\nElectric toothbrush models that currently utilise Bluetooth include the Oral-B Pro 6000, Pro 6500, Pro 7000 and Genius 9000.\n\n=== Cleaning modes ===\nMost sonic toothbrushes come with different cleaning modes and intensity levels. Cleaning modes are designed for special types of cleaning efficiency. Some of the most well known are Sensitive, Daily care, Whitening and Tongue cleaning.\n\nCertain toothbrushes that offer both ultrasonic and sonic motion allow for the intensity of the sonic motion to be reduced, or even for the sonic motion to be turned off entirely so that only ultrasound is emitted.  Since ultrasound movements are very low in amplitude, this setting may be indicated for patients who may not be suitable candidates for typical sonic or power toothbrush vibration but need the additional cleaning power of an ultrasonic toothbrush, such as patients who have recently undergone periodontal surgery.\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Medicine}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Automation in the bathroom|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Dental equipment]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:20th-century inventions]]\n", "text_old": "An '''electric toothbrush''' is a [[toothbrush]] that makes rapid automatic bristle motions, either back-and-forth [[oscillating|oscillation]] or [[rotation]]-oscillation (where the brush head alternates clockwise and counterclockwise rotation), in order to [[tooth brushing|clean teeth]].

The GE Automatic Toothbrush came with a charging stand which held the hand piece upright; most units were kept in the charger, which is not the best way to get maximum service life from a NiCad battery. Also, early NiCad batteries tended to have a short lifespan. The batteries were sealed inside the GE device, and the whole unit had to be discarded when the batteries failed.\n\nThe use of an AC line voltage appliance in a bathroom environment was problematic. By the early 1990s [[Underwriter Laboratories]] (UL) and [[Canadian Standards Association]] (CSA) no longer certified line-voltage appliances for bathroom use. Newer appliances had to use a step-down [[transformer]] to operate the actual toothbrush at low voltage (typically 12, 16 or 24 volts). Wiring standards in many countries require that outlets in bath areas must be protected by a [[Residual-current device|RCD/GFCI]] device (e.g., required in USA since the 1970s on bathroom outlets in new construction).\n\nBy the 1990s there were problems with safety certification of Broxo's original design.

Independent research finds that most electric toothbrushes are no more effective than manual brushes\u2014assuming the manual toothbrush brush is used effectively.<ref name=CD002281>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yaacob M, Worthington HV, Deacon SA, Deery C, Walmsley AD, Robinson PG, Glenny AM |title=Powered versus manual toothbrushing for oral health |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=3 |pages=CD002281 |year=2014 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002281.pub3 |url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD002281/frame.html |pmid=24934383 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} \u2014 Meta-analysis of studies of the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Deery C, Heanue M, Deacon S, Robinson PG, Walmsley AD, Worthington H, Shaw W, Glenny AM |title=The effectiveness of manual versus powered toothbrushes for dental health: a systematic review |journal=J Dent |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=197\u2013211 |date=March 2004 |doi=10.1016/j.jdent.2003.11.006 | pmid=15001285}}</ref> The rotation-oscillation models have been found to be marginally better than manual ones, though of uncertain clinical importance.<ref name=CD002281/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2679175.stm |title=Thumbs down for electric toothbrush|work= BBC News | date=21 January 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Penick C |title=Power toothbrushes: a critical review  |journal=Int J Dent Hyg |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=40\u20134 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-5037.2004.00048.x |pmid=16451451}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue = 12|pages = CD004971|last=Deacon|first=Scott A|last2=Glenny|first2=Anne-Marie|last3=Deery|first3=Chris|last4=Robinson|first4=Peter G|last5=Heanue|first5=Mike|last6=Walmsley|first6=A Damien|last7=Shaw|first7=William C|date=2010-12-08|isbn = |language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd004971.pub2|pmid = 21154357}}</ref> The research concludes that the way brushing is done, including the amount of time spent, is more important than the choice of brush.

Most manufacturers recommend that heads be changed every three to six months at minimum, or as soon as the brush head has visibly deteriorated.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== Power source and charging ==\nModern electric toothbrushes run on low voltage, 12v or less. A few units use a step-down [[transformer]] to power the brush, but most use a battery, usually but not always rechargeable and non-replaceable, fitted inside the handle, which is hermetically sealed to prevent water damage. While early NiCd battery toothbrushes used metal tabs to connect with the charging base, some toothbrushes use [[inductive charging]].\n\n== Environmental concerns ==\nAccording to [[Friends of the Earth]], \"Disposable electric toothbrushes are one example of a terrible product ... it's virtually impossible to separate out the tech from the batteries and plastic casing which means valuable and often toxic materials are dumped in landfill or burnt in incinerators.\"<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|last1=Kleinman|first1=Zoe|title=Ikea unveils phone-charging furniture at MWC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31693088|accessdate=2 March 2015|work=[[BBC]]|date=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Optional features ==\n\n=== Timer ===\nMany modern electric toothbrushes have a timer which buzzes, or briefly interrupts power, typically after two minutes, and sometimes every 30 seconds. This is associated with a customary recommendation to brush for two minutes, 30 seconds for each of the four quadrants of the mouth.\n\n=== Display ===\nSome electric toothbrushes have [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] screens which show brushing time and sometimes smiley face [[icon (computing)|icon]]s or other images to encourage optimal brushing. These features could encourage people to brush more accurately.<ref name=\"Daniel E. Jolly, Professor of Clinical Dentistry College of Dentistry\nThe Ohio State University.\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100404123609/http://www.netwellness.org/healthtopics/dentistry/faq2.cfm Dental and Oral Health (Adults) Don't Let a Disability Keep the Dentist Away] \u2014 Daniel E. Jolly, Professor of Clinical Dentistry College of Dentistry The Ohio State University.</ref><ref name=\"The Smile Team Dental Centre Balwyn North\"/>\n\n=== Pressure sensor ===\nBrushing teeth too hard causes enamel and gum damage. Most modern top-end sonic toothbrushes come with a pressure sensor, which prevents users from brushing too aggressively. There are two types of pressure sensors. Some sensors produce a sound warning and some immediately stop movements of the sonic toothbrush when it is used too aggressively.\n\n=== Ultrasound indicator ===\nBecause of the fact that ultrasonic frequencies are beyond the [[audible range]] and the amplitude of movement emitted by an ultrasonic toothbrush is typically too small to be perceived, the ultrasound is imperceptible to humans and it may not be apparent that a brush running in pure ultrasound is turned on. Ultrasonic toothbrushes may include an indicator to notify the patient that ultrasound is being emitted.\n\n=== Bluetooth ===\n\n[[Bluetooth]] connectivity enables data to be transmitted from an electric toothbrush to another Bluetooth device, such as a smartphone. The brush can send data to an app, such as how long it has been brushing for and if too much pressure has been applied when brushing. The app can in turn send data back to the brush such as changing the cleaning modes available, and cleaning time.\nThe sharing of data between toothbrush and smartphone is intended to assist the user in creating better brushing technique and habits.\nElectric toothbrush models that currently utilise Bluetooth include the Oral-B Pro 6000, Pro 6500, Pro 7000 and Genius 9000.\n\n=== Cleaning modes ===\nMost sonic toothbrushes come with different cleaning modes and intensity levels. Cleaning modes are designed for special types of cleaning efficiency. Some of the most well known are Sensitive, Daily care, Whitening and Tongue cleaning.\n\nCertain toothbrushes that offer both ultrasonic and sonic motion allow for the intensity of the sonic motion to be reduced, or even for the sonic motion to be turned off entirely so that only ultrasound is emitted.  Since ultrasound movements are very low in amplitude, this setting may be indicated for patients who may not be suitable candidates for typical sonic or power toothbrush vibration but need the additional cleaning power of an ultrasonic toothbrush, such as patients who have recently undergone periodontal surgery.\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Medicine}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Automation in the bathroom|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Dental equipment]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:20th-century inventions]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePower source and charging:fmt", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_toothbrush"}

In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to [[Kemosabe Records]]. Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper [[Flo Rida]]'s number-one single \"[[Right Round]]\".\n\nKesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010) and ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017), and the number-six record ''[[Warrior (Kesha album)|Warrior]]'' (2012). She has attained ten top-ten singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including \"[[Blah Blah Blah (Kesha song)|Blah Blah Blah]]\", \"[[Your Love Is My Drug]]\", \"[[Take It Off (Kesha song)|Take It Off]]\", \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]\", \"[[Die Young (Kesha song)|Die Young]]\", \"[[My First Kiss]]\" with [[3OH!3]], and the chart-topping \"[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]\", \"[[We R Who We R]]\", \"Right Round\" with Flo Rida, and \"[[Timber (Pitbull song)|Timber]]\" with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. \"Tik Tok\", at one point, was the [[List of best-selling singles#Best-selling digital singles|best-selling digital single in history]], selling over 16.5 million units internationally. As of November 2019, the song has sold over 25 million copies. In 2020, Kesha released her fourth studio album [[High Road (Kesha album)|''High Road'']]. She has also written songs for other artists, including \"[[Till the World Ends]]\" for [[Britney Spears]] (2011).\n\nKesha's career was halted between ''Warrior'' and ''Rainbow'' due to a legal dispute with her former producer [[Dr. Luke]], which has been ongoing since 2014.

Once they get to the concert, they find the same blue van, and Val throws a small firecracker into it, causing the three boys inside to climb out. Ivan owns the van and his buddies Kovacs and Mark, who is said to be leaving for [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] soon, are interested in the girls. After the show, Alexis invites the boys to her father's empty mansion. Bev and Mark seem to like each other, yet Bev seems to almost avoid him. The girls drug the boys' drinks and reveal they are going to murder them and make it look like a Satanic cult killing.\n\nThe Daughters of the Dawn, the church the girls are a part of, has murdered eighteen other people in the same way in order to create fear and send more people to their religion. Alexis is shown to be the most insane and stabs Ivan after he criticizes her religious belief in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], and he bleeds to death. Mark and Kovacs briefly escape, and the two boys hide in a pantry. Susan, Alexis's soon-to-be ex-stepmother, comes home to retrieve a passport and reveals she has called the police because she saw the strange blue van and the house lights on. Susan then discovers Ivan's body and Alexis stabs her to death.\n\nA police officer arrives and becomes suspicious, so Alexis runs from him and back into the house where he chases her, gun raised. The officer finds the injured Kovacs and Mark who pleads for help but Val sneaks up on him, takes his gun, and shoots him, killing him. Alexis and Val fight over the gun, and Bev appears, threatening her friends with a chainsaw. Val and Alexis tell Bev they are doing the Lord's work, but Bev declares she will let Mark and Kovacs go.\n\nBev tries to help Mark and Kovacs, the latter who is bleeding out and won't last much longer unless he gets to a hospital. Alexis has the car keys, so Mark goes after her to retrieve them. When Kovacs sees car lights, he goes outside struggling to walk to find John Henry Butler, Alexis's father and the pastor of the Daughters of the Dawn. Mark gets the keys, but Alexis attacks him and they fight. Val attacks Bev and tries to kill her, but Bev lights Val on fire (her hair being full of hairspray). Butler attacks Kovacs off-screen and he makes it back into the house where Bev finds him. Just before Kovacs dies, he tells Bev to save Mark.\n\nButler shoots Mark as he is strangling Alexis. He then berates his daughter for doing a terrible job murdering and covering it up. He tells Alexis they have to make some sacrifices to get out of the predicament she has caused and attempts to strangle her to death when Bev comes up and knocks him out. Alexis is over-the-top crazy and Bev throws her out of a window in a dramatic and exaggerated fashion. Mark is still alive, and he drives away with Bev, only to find Alexis standing in the road.

Once they get to the concert, they find the same blue van, and Val throws a small firecracker into it, causing the three boys inside to climb out. Ivan owns the van and his buddies Kovacs and Mark, who is said to be leaving for [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] soon, are interested in the girls. After the show, Alexis invites the boys to her father's empty mansion. Bev and Mark seem to like each other, yet Bev seems to almost avoid him. The girls drug the boys' drinks and reveal they are going to murder them and make it look like a Satanic cult killing.\n\nThe Daughters of the Dawn, the church the girls are a part of, has murdered eighteen other people in the same way in order to create fear and send more people to their religion. Alexis is shown to be the most insane and stabs Ivan after he criticizes her religious belief in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], and he bleeds to death. Mark and Kovacs briefly escape, and the two boys hide in a pantry. Susan, Alexis's soon-to-be ex-stepmother, comes home to retrieve a passport and reveals she has called the police because she saw the strange blue van and the house lights on. Susan then discovers Ivan's body and Alexis stabs her to death.\n\nA police officer arrives and becomes suspicious, so Alexis runs from him and back into the house where he chases her, gun raised. The officer finds the injured Kovacs and Mark who pleads for help but Val sneaks up on him, takes his gun, and shoots him, killing him. Alexis and Val fight over the gun, and Bev appears, threatening her friends with a chainsaw. Val and Alexis tell Bev they are doing the Lord's work, but Bev declares she will let Mark and Kovacs go.\n\nBev tries to help Mark and Kovacs, the latter who is bleeding out and won't last much longer unless he gets to a hospital. Alexis has the car keys, so Mark goes after her to retrieve them. When Kovacs sees car lights, he goes outside struggling to walk to find John Henry Butler, Alexis's father and the pastor of the Daughters of the Dawn. Mark gets the keys, but Alexis attacks him and they fight. Val attacks Bev and tries to kill her, but Bev lights Val on fire (her hair being full of hairspray). Butler attacks Kovacs off-screen and he makes it back into the house where Bev finds him. Just before Kovacs dies, he tells Bev to save Mark.\n\nButler shoots Mark as he is strangling Alexis. He then berates his daughter for doing a terrible job murdering and covering it up. He tells Alexis they have to make some sacrifices to get out of the predicament she has caused and attempts to strangle her to death when Bev comes up and knocks him out. Alexis is over-the-top crazy and Bev throws her out of a window in a dramatic and exaggerated fashion. Mark is still alive, and he drives away with Bev, only to find Alexis standing in the road. Off-camera, Bev runs Alexis over.\n\nButler is still alive and makes himself into a victim, claiming that Alexis was led astray and joined a Satanic cult. Bev and Mark leave town together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Alexis Butler \n* [[Keean Johnson]] as Mark  \n* [[Maddie Hasson]] as Valerie\n* [[Logan Miller]] as Kovacs \n* [[Amy Forsyth]] as Beverly \n* [[Austin Swift]] as Ivan\n* [[Allison McAtee]] as Susan Butler \n* [[Johnny Knoxville]] as Pastor John Henry Butler \n* Stephanie Moroz as Reporter Trish Williams\n* Tanner Beard as Sheriff Dembrowski  \n* Harry Nelken\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 5.91/10.

Relevant phenomena include [[supernova]] explosions, [[gamma ray burst]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[blazar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates outside [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. [[Cosmology]] is a branch of astronomy.

The early civilizations in [[recorded history]] made methodical observations of the [[night sky]]. These include the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonians]], [[Greek astronomy|Greeks]], [[Indian astronomy|Indians]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egyptians]], [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and many ancient [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as [[astrometry]], [[celestial navigation]], [[observational astronomy]], and the making of [[calendar]]s.

Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.\n\nAmateurs play an [[citizen science|active role]] in astronomy. It is one of the few sciences in which this is the case. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of [[transient astronomical event|transient events]]. [[amateur astronomy|Amateur astronomers]] have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:SLNSW 479519 16 Observatory SH 198.jpg|thumb|19th-century, Australia (1873)]]\n[[File:Quito Observatory.JPG|thumb|19th-century [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]] is located 12 minutes south of the [[Equator]] in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]].<ref>http://oaq.epn.edu.ec/  Official Web Site of one of the oldest Observatories in South America, the  [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]]</ref>]]\n''Astronomy'' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1#Ancient Greek|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1]] from [[wikt:\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd#Ancient Greek|\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd]] ''astron'', \"star\" and -\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 ''[[wikt:-nomy|-nomia]]'' from [[wikt:\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]] ''nomos'', \"law\" or \"culture\") means \"law of the stars\" (or \"culture of the stars\" depending on the translation).

In addition to their ceremonial uses, these [[Observatory|observatories]] could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.<ref name=\"history\">Forbes, 1909</ref>\n\nBefore tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in [[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamia]], [[Greek astronomy|Greece]], [[Astrology in medieval Islam|Persia]], [[Indian astronomy|India]], [[Chinese astronomy|China]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egypt]], and [[Maya civilization|Central America]], astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop. Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as [[astrometry]]. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the [[geocentric model]] of the Universe, or the [[Ptolemaic system]], named after [[Ptolemy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=DeWitt|first=Richard|title=Worldviews: An Introduction to the History and Philosophy of Science|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, England|isbn=978-1-4051-9563-8|page=113|chapter=The Ptolemaic System}}</ref>\n[[File:Suryaprajnapati Sutra.jpg|thumb|The Suryaprajnaptis\u016btra, a 6th-century BC astronomy text of [[Jains]] at The Schoyen Collection, London.

Kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the planets around the Sun. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down.<ref>Forbes, 1909, pp. 49\u201358</ref> It was [[Isaac Newton]], with his invention of [[celestial dynamics]] and his [[gravity|law of gravitation]], who finally explained the motions of the planets.

This work was further refined by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] and [[Pierre Simon Laplace]], allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.<ref>Forbes, 1909, pp. 74\u201376</ref>\n\nSignificant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the [[spectroscope]] and [[Astrophotography|photography]].

Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.\n\nA spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the [[Milky Way]] and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], are spiral galaxies.\n\nIrregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.\n\nAn active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.\n\nA [[radio galaxy]] is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas.

[[Cosmochemistry]] is the study of the chemicals found within the Solar System, including the origins of the elements and variations in the [[isotope]] ratios.

As civilizations developed, most notably in [[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamia]], [[Greek astronomy|Greece]], [[Astrology in medieval Islam|Persia]], [[Indian astronomy|India]], [[Chinese astronomy|China]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egypt]], and [[Maya civilization|Central America]], astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop. Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as [[astrometry]]. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it.

The stars move along [[randomness|random]] orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.\n\nA spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the [[Milky Way]] and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], are spiral galaxies.\n\nIrregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.\n\nAn active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.\n\nA [[radio galaxy]] is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas.

As \"[[forensic astronomy]]\", finally, methods from astronomy have been used to solve problems of law and history.\n\n==Amateur astronomy==\n[[File:Telescope trailer 22.jpg|right|thumb|Amateur astronomers can build their own equipment, and hold star parties and gatherings, such as [[Stellafane]].]]\n{{Main|Amateur astronomy}}\n\nAstronomy is one of the sciences to which amateurs can contribute the most.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last = Mims III|first = Forrest M.\n|title=Amateur Science\u2014Strong Tradition, Bright Future\n|journal=Science|date=1999|volume=284|issue=5411\n|pages=55\u201356\n|doi=10.1126/science.284.5411.55\n|quote=Astronomy has traditionally been among the most fertile fields for serious amateurs [...]\n|bibcode = 1999Sci...284...55M }}</ref>\n\nCollectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with [[Amateur telescope making|equipment that they build themselves]]. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, [[meteor shower]]s, and a variety of [[deep-sky object]]s such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur [[astrophotography]], involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amsmeteors.org/|title = The American Meteor Society|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060822135040/http://www.amsmeteors.org/| archivedate= 22 August 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Jerry|last=Lodriguss|url=http://www.astropix.com/|title = Catching the Light: Astrophotography|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901185541/http://www.astropix.com/| archivedate= 1 September 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nMost amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]], who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (''e.g.'' the [[One-Mile Telescope]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Ghigo, F.|date = 7 February 2006|url=http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_jansky.shtml|title = Karl Jansky and the Discovery of Cosmic Radio Waves|publisher = National Radio Astronomy Observatory|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060831105945/http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_jansky.shtml| archivedate= 31 August 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~arcus/cara/|title = Cambridge Amateur Radio Astronomers|accessdate =24 August 2006 }}</ref>\n\nAmateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field of astronomy and it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars.
