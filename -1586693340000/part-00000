It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]].

To avoid severe population declines during the periodic fall in lynx populations, Alaska and most Canadian provinces regulate the time periods and fur quantity for trapping. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

It outlines the major [[national security]] concerns of the United States and how the administration plans to deal with them. The legal foundation for the document is spelled out in the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]]. The document is purposely general in content, and its implementation relies on elaborating guidance provided in supporting documents such as the [[National Military Strategy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nssarchive.us/|title=National Security Strategy Archive|website=National Security Strategy Archive|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n==Purposes of the NSS Report==\n\n<blockquote>The stated intent of the Goldwater-Nichols legislation is broadly accepted as valid for effective political discourse on issues affecting the nation's security\u2014the Congress and the Executive need a common understanding of the strategic environment and the administration's intent as a starting point for future dialogue. That said, however, it is understood that in the adversarial environment that prevails, this report can only provide a beginning point for the dialogue necessary to reach such a \"common\" understanding.<ref name=Snider1995>{{cite book|last= Snider |first=  Don M.|url= http://nssarchive.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Snider.pdf |title=THE NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY: DOCUMENTING STRATEGIC VISION|date=March 1995|publisher=Strategic Studies Institute}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe requirement of producing this report along with the budget request leads to an iterative, interagency process involving high level meetings that helps to resolve internal differences in foreign policy agendas. However, \"this report was not to be a neutral planning document, as many academics and even some in uniform think it to be. Rather it was ... intended to serve five primary purposes.\" <ref  name=Snider1995 />\n\n# Communicate the Executive's strategic vision to Congress, and thus legitimize its requests for resources.\n# Communicate the Executive's strategic vision to foreign constituencies, especially governments not on the US's summit agenda.\n# Communicate with select domestic audiences, such as political supporters seeking Presidential recognition of their issues, and those who hope to see a coherent and farsighted strategy they could support.\n# Create internal consensus on foreign and defense policy within the executive branch.\n# Contribute to the overall agenda of the President, both in terms of substance and messaging.\n\nWhere the incoming executive team has not formulated a national security strategy, such as an after an election in which foreign policy and defense were not important campaign issues, the process of writing the report can be of immense importance:\n<blockquote>Few things educate new political appointees faster as to their own strategic sensings, or to the qualities and competencies of the \"permanent\" government they lead within executive bureaucracies, than to have to commit in writing to the President their plans for the future and how they can be integrated, coordinated and otherwise shared with other agencies and departments.

Of these 5 lay across the [[Hooghly River|Hooghly]] in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side.  After the fall of [[Siraj-ud-daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab of Bengal]], it purchased these villages in 1758 from [[Mir Jafar]], and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as ''[[Dihi Panchannagram]]'' and Bhowanipore was one of them.

The stretch started with Purna near Jadu Babu's Bazaar, and was followed up by Bharati, Indira, Bijoli, Basusree, Kalika, and Ujjwala, right up to the recesses of the Kalighat Temple. They were primarily famous for their screenings of Bengali, English and Hindi movies. However, due to the lack of patronage and drying up of the Bengali film box office in the mid 90s, and the first decade of the 2000s, most of these halls have been closed down. Basusree, Indira and Bijoli are still operational, though the condition is not that well of, Bharati, Kalika, and Ujjwala have been demolished to make way for multi storied buildings that host malls, educational institutes, and marriage halls. Purna has been closed down for more than a decade now, and there is little hope that it will be opened again.\n\nThe area also has the 23 Palli Durga Mandir, a small Temple which houses an Ashta Dhaatu Murti of Durga, and near the well known Kalighat Kali Temple, and the Nakuleshwar Bhairav Temple, considered as one of the holiest of the holies in Hindu religion.\n\n==Healthcare==\n[[File:IPGMER SSKM Woodburn.jpg|thumb|SSKM Hospital, one of the oldest and most popular hospitals in the city of Kolkata]]\n* [[Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute]]\n* [[SSKM Hospital]]\n\n==Education==\n* [[Asutosh College]], S.

The stretch started with Purna near Jadu Babu's Bazaar, and was followed up by Bharati, Indira, Bijoli, Basusree, Kalika, and Ujjwala, right up to the recesses of the Kalighat Temple. They were primarily famous for their screenings of Bengali, English and Hindi movies. However, due to the lack of patronage and drying up of the Bengali film box office in the mid 90s, and the first decade of the 2000s, most of these halls have been closed down. Basusree, Indira and Bijoli are still operational, though the condition is not that well of, Bharati, Kalika, and Ujjwala have been demolished to make way for multi storied buildings that host malls, educational institutes, and marriage halls. Purna has been closed down for more than a decade now, and there is little hope that it will be opened again.\n\nThe area also has the 23 Palli Durga Mandir, a small Temple which houses an Ashta Dhaatu Murti of Durga, and near the well known Kalighat Kali Temple, and the Nakuleshwar Bhairav Temple, considered as one of the holiest of the holies in Hindu religion.\n\n==Healthcare==\n[[File:IPGMER SSKM Woodburn.jpg|thumb|SSKM Hospital, one of the oldest and most popular hospitals in the city of Kolkata]]\n* [[Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute]]\n* [[SSKM Hospital]]\n\n==Education==\n* [[Asutosh College]], S.

It astonished visitors with its clear walls and ceilings that did not require interior lights.\n\nIt has been suggested that the name of the building resulted from a piece penned by the playwright [[Douglas Jerrold]], who in July 1850 wrote in the satirical magazine ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' about the forthcoming Great Exhibition, referring to a \"palace of very crystal\".<ref>The ''Punch'' issue of 13 July 1850 carried a contribution by Douglas Jerrold, writing as Mrs Amelia Mouser, which referred to a ''palace of very crystal''.{{cite book |title=Douglas Jerrold') |author=Michael Slater |publisher=Duckworth |year=2002 |isbn=0-7156-2824-0 |page=243 |location=London}}.

It was rebuilt at the top of Penge Peak next to [[Sydenham Hill]], an affluent suburb of large villas. It stood there from June 1854 until its destruction by fire in November 1936. The nearby residential area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] after the landmark.

An executive Building Committee was quickly formed to oversee the design and construction of the exhibition building, comprising accomplished engineers [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] and [[Robert Stephenson]], renowned architects [[Charles Barry]] and [[Thomas Leverton Donaldson]], the [[Duke of Buccleuch]] and the [[Earl of Ellesmere]], and chaired by [[William Cubitt]]. By 15 March 1850 they were ready to invite submissions, which had to conform to several key specifications: the building had to be temporary, simple, as cheap as possible, and economical to build within the short time remaining before the Exhibition opening, which had already been scheduled for 1 May 1851.<ref name=\"Kate Colquhoun 2004\">Kate Colquhoun, ''A Thing in Disguise: The Visionary Life of Joseph Paxton'' (Harper Collins, 2004), Ch. 16</ref>\n\nWithin three weeks, the committee had received some 245 entries, including 38 international submissions from Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hanover, Switzerland, Brunswick, Hamburg and France.

The preferred site was in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], adjacent to Princes Gate near Kensington Rd, but other sites considered included [[Wormwood Scrubs]], [[Battersea Park]], the [[Isle of Dogs]], [[Victoria Park, London|Victoria Park]], and [[Regent's Park]]. Opponents of the scheme lobbied strenuously against the use of Hyde Park (and they were strongly supported by ''[[The Times]]''). The most outspoken critic was arch-conservative Col. [[Charles de Laet Waldo Sibthorp]]; he denounced the Exhibition as \"one of the greatest humbugs, frauds and absurdities ever known\",<ref name=\"Kate Colquhoun 2004\"/> and his trenchant opposition to both the Exhibition and its building continued even after it had closed.\n\n[[File:Gtexhib.jpg|thumb|Joseph Paxton's first sketch for the Great Exhibition Building, about 1850, pen and ink on blotting paper, V&A Museum]]\n\nAt this point renowned gardener [[Joseph Paxton]] became interested in the project, and with the enthusiastic backing of Commission member [[Henry Cole]], he decided to submit his own design. At this time, Paxton was chiefly known for his celebrated career as the head gardener for the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]] at [[Chatsworth House]], and by 1850 he had become a preeminent figure in British horticulture and had also earned great renown as a freelance garden designer; his works included the pioneering public gardens at [[Birkenhead Park]] which directly influenced the [[Frederick Law Olmsted#New York City's Central Park|design of New York's Central Park]]. At Chatsworth, Paxton had experimented extensively with glasshouse construction, developing many novel techniques for modular construction, using combinations of standard-sized sheets of glass, [[laminated wood]], and prefabricated cast iron. The \"Great Stove\" (or conservatory) at Chatsworth (built in 1836) was the first major application of Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof design, and was at the time the largest glass building in the world,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian/art/architecture/iron/21b.html|title=The Great Stove, Chatsworth|website=www.victorianweb.org}}</ref> covering around {{convert|28000|ft2}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/iron/21b.html|title=The Great Stove, Chatsworth|website=www.victorianweb.org}}</ref>\n\nA decade later, taking advantage of the availability of the new [[cast plate glass]], Paxton further developed his techniques with the Chatsworth Lily House, which featured a flat-roof version of the ridge-and-furrow glazing, and a [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] system that allowed the hanging of vertical bays of glass from cantilevered beams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=725|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203626/http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=725|url-status=dead|title=Engineering Timelines - Chatsworth Conservatory and Lily House, site of|archivedate=4 March 2016|website=www.engineering-timelines.com}}</ref> The Lily House was built specifically to house the giant ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'' waterlily which had only recently been discovered by European botanists; the first specimen to reach England was originally kept at [[Kew Gardens]], but it did not do well. Paxton's reputation as a gardener was so high by that time that he was invited to take the lily to Chatsworth; it thrived under his care and in 1849 he caused a sensation in the horticultural world when he succeeded in producing the first ''amazonica'' flowers to be grown in England (his daughter Alice was drawn for the newspapers, standing on one of leaves). The lily and its house led directly to Paxton's design for the Crystal Palace and he later cited the huge ribbed floating leaves as a key inspiration.<ref>[http://www.virtualherbarium.org/gardenviews/victoriaamazonica.html Jennifer Davit, \"Victoria: The Reigning Queen of Waterlilies\", Virtual Herbarium] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001651/http://www.virtualherbarium.org/gardenviews/victoriaamazonica.html |date=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nPaxton left his meeting with Henry Cole on 9 June 1850 fired with enthusiasm. He immediately went to Hyde Park, where he 'walked' the site earmarked for the Exhibition. Two days later, on 11 June, while attending a board meeting of the Midland Railway, Paxton made his original concept drawing, which he doodled onto a sheet of pink [[blotting paper]]. This rough sketch (now in the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]]) incorporated all the basic features of the finished building, and it is a mark of Paxton's ingenuity and industriousness that detailed plans, calculations and costings were ready to submit in less than two weeks.\n\nThe project was a major gamble for Paxton, but circumstances were in his favour: he enjoyed a stellar reputation as a garden designer and builder, he was confident that his design was perfectly suited to the brief, and the Commission was now under enormous pressure to choose a design and get it built, the Exhibition opening now being less than a year away. In the event, Paxton's design fulfilled and surpassed all the requirements, and it proved to be vastly faster and cheaper to build than any other form of building of a comparable size. Indeed, his submission was budgeted at a remarkably low \u00a385,800; by comparison, this was about 2-1/2 times more than the Great Stove at Chatsworth<ref>\"Paxton and the Great Stove\", ''Architectural History'', Vol. 4, (1961), pp. 77\u201392</ref> but it was only 28 percent of the estimated cost of Turner's design, and it promised a building which, with a footprint of over {{convert|770000|ft2|acre ha}}, would cover roughly 25 times the ground area of its progenitor.\n\nImpressed by the low bid for the construction contract submitted by the engineering firm [[Fox, Henderson and Co]], the commission accepted the scheme and finally gave its public endorsement to Paxton's design in July 1850. He was exultant, but now had less than eight months to finalize his plans, manufacture the parts and erect the building in time for the Exhibition's opening, which was scheduled for 1 May 1851. Paxton was able to design and build the largest glass structure yet created, from scratch, in less than a year, and complete it on schedule and on budget. He was even able to alter the design shortly before building began, adding a high, barrel-vaulted [[transept]] across the centre of the building, at 90 degrees to the main gallery, under which he was able to safely enclose several large elm trees that would otherwise have had to be felled\u2014thereby also resolving a controversial issue that had been a major sticking point for the vocal anti-Exhibition lobby.\n\n=== Design ===\n[[File:Crystal.Palace.Paxton.Plan.jpg|thumb|left|Partial front (left) and rear (right) elevations of the Crystal Palace]]\n\nPaxton's modular, hierarchical design reflected his practical brilliance as a designer and problem-solver. It incorporated many breakthroughs, offered practical advantages that no conventional building could match and, above all, embodied the spirit of British innovation and industrial might that the Great Exhibition was intended to celebrate.\n\nThe geometry of the Crystal Palace was a classic example of the concept of form following manufacturer's limitations: the shape and size of the whole building was directly based around the size of the panes of glass made by the supplier, [[Chance Brothers]] of Smethwick. These were the largest available at the time, measuring {{convert|10|in|cm}} wide by {{convert|49|in|cm}} long. Because the entire building was scaled around those dimensions, it meant that nearly the whole outer surface could be glazed using millions of identical panes, thereby drastically reducing both their production cost and the time needed to install them.\n\nThe original Hyde Park building was essentially a vast, flat-roofed rectangular hall. A huge open gallery ran along the main axis, with wings extending down either side. The main exhibition space was two stories high, with the upper floor stepped in from the boundary. Most of the building had a flat-profile roof, except for the central transept, which was covered by a {{convert|72|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} barrel-vaulted roof that stood {{convert|168|ft}} high at the top of the arch. Both the flat-profile sections and the arched transept roof were constructed using the key element of Paxton's design: his patented ridge-and-furrow roofing system, which had first seen use at Chatsworth. The basic roofing unit, in essence, took the form of a long triangular prism, which made it both extremely light and very strong, and meant it could be built with the minimum amount of materials.\n\nPaxton set the dimensions of this prism by using the length of single pane of glass ({{convert|49|in|cm}}) as the [[hypotenuse]] of a right-angled triangle, thereby creating a triangle with a length-to-height ratio of 2.5:1, whose base (adjacent side) was {{convert|4|ft}} long. By mirroring this triangle he obtained the {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} gables that formed the vertical faces at either end of the prism, each of which was {{convert|24|ft}} long. With this arrangement, Paxton could glaze the entire roof surface with identical panes that did not need to be trimmed. Paxton placed three of these {{convert|8|ft}} by {{convert|24|ft}} roof units side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars. The resulting cube, with a floor area of {{convert|24|ft}} by {{convert|24|ft}}, formed the basic structural module of the building.\n\nBy multiplying these modules into a grid, the structure could be extended virtually infinitely. In its original form, the ground level of the Crystal Palace (in plan) measured {{convert|1848|ft}} by {{convert|456|ft}}, which equates to a grid 77 modules long by 19 modules wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/london/model/geo.html|title=water|website=www2.iath.virginia.edu}}</ref> Because each module was self-supporting, Paxton was able to leave out modules in some areas, creating larger square or rectangular spaces within the building to accommodate larger exhibits. On the lower level, these larger spaces were covered by the floor above, and on the upper level by longer spans of roofing, but the dimensions of these larger spaces were always multiples of the basic {{convert|24|ft}} by {{convert|24|ft}} grid unit. The modules were also strong enough to be stacked vertically, enabling Paxton to add an upper floor that nearly doubled the amount of available exhibition space. Paxton also used longer trellis girders to create a clear span for the roof of the immense central gallery, which was {{convert|72|ft}} wide and {{convert|1800|ft}} long.\n\n[[File:Crystal Palace - plan.jpg|thumb|380px|Plan of the Crystal Palace]]\n\nPaxton's roofing system incorporated his elegant solution to the problem of draining the building's vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional. During construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering\u2014a patented design now widely known as a \"Paxton gutter\". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function: each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building.\n\nOne of the few issues Paxton could not completely solve was leaks\u2014when completed, rain was found to be leaking into the huge building in over a thousand places. The leaks were sealed with putty, but the relatively poor quality of the sealant materials available at the time meant that the problem was never totally overcome.\n\nTo maintain a comfortable temperature inside such a large glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely on the fact that they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions: they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards {{convert|22|cm|in}} wide, which were spaced about {{convert|1|cm|in}} apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Because of the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function: the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors at the end of each day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly.<ref name=\"bl.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106135.html|title=Sketch for the Crystal Palace|website=www.bl.uk}}</ref>\n\nThanks to the considerable economies of scale Paxton was able to exploit, the manufacture and assembly of the building parts was exceedingly quick and cheap. Each module was identical, fully prefabricated, self-supporting, and fast and easy to erect. All of the parts could be mass-produced in large numbers, and many parts served multiple functions, further reducing both the number of parts needed and their overall cost. Because of its comparatively low weight, the Crystal Palace required absolutely no heavy masonry for supporting walls or foundations, and the relatively light concrete footings on which it stood could be left in the ground once the building was removed (they remain in place today just beneath the surface of the site). The modules could be erected as quickly as the parts could reach the site\u2014indeed, some sections were standing within eighteen hours of leaving the factory\u2014and since each unit was self-supporting, workers were able to assemble much of the building section-by-section, without having to wait for other parts to be finished.\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:Crystal Palace - interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Crystal Palace]]\nFox, Henderson and co took possession of the site in July 1850 and erected wooden hoardings which were constructed using the timber that later became the floorboards of the finished building. More than 5,000 [[navvy|navvies]] worked on the building during its construction, with up to 2,000 on site at one time during the peak building phase.<ref>For the peak figure of 2,000 workers daily see: {{cite book |isbn=0-485-11575-1 |title=The Crystal Palace and the Great Exhibition |page=34 |author=Hermione Hobhouse. |year=2002 |publisher=Athlone |location=London}} and the University of Virginia's {{cite web |url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/allcach2k/Programme/session1.html |title=Modeling the Crystal Palace |year=2001}} project: {{cite web |url=http://www.iath.virginia.edu/london/model/animation.html# |title=''The Crystal Palace Animation'' Exterior and Interior |accessdate=20 November 2007}}</ref>\nMore than 1,000 iron columns supported 2,224 trellis girders and 30 miles of guttering, comprising 4,000 tons of iron in all.<ref name=\"bl.uk\" />\n\nFirstly stakes were driven into the ground to roughly mark out the positions for the cast iron columns; these points were then set precisely by [[theodolite]] measurements. Then the concrete foundations were poured, and the base plates for the columns were set into them. Once the foundations were in place, the erection of the modules proceeded rapidly. Connector brackets were attached to the top of each column before erection, and these were then hoisted into position. Since the project took place before the development of powered cranes, the raising of the columns was done manually using [[Shear legs|shears]] (or shear legs), a simple crane mechanism. These consisted of two strong poles, which were set several meters apart at the base and then lashed together at the top to form a triangle; this was stabilized and kept vertical by guy ropes fixed to the apex, stretched taut and tied to stakes driven into the ground some distance away. Using pulleys and ropes hung from the apex of the shear, the navvies hoisted the columns, girders and other parts into place.\n\nAs soon as two adjacent columns had been erected, a girder was hoisted into place between them and bolted onto the connectors. The columns were erected in opposite pairs, then two more girders were connected to form a self-supporting square\u2014this was the basic frame of each module. The shears would then be moved along and an adjoining bay constructed. When a reasonable number of bays had been completed, the columns for the upper floor were erected (longer shear-legs were used for this, but the operation was essentially the same as for the ground floor). Once the ground floor structure was complete, the final assembly of the upper floor followed rapidly.\n\nFor the glazing, Paxton used larger versions of machines he had originally devised for the Great Stove at Chatsworth, installing on-site [[production line]] systems, powered by steam engines, that dressed and finished the building parts. These included a machine that mechanically grooved the wooden window sash bars, and a painting machine that automatically dipped the parts in paint and then passed them through a series of rotating brushes to remove the excess.\n[[File:Crystal Palace Great Exhibition tree 1851.png|thumb|A tree enclosed within the Crystal Palace]]\n\nThe last major components to be put into place were the sixteen semi-circular ribs of the vaulted transept, which were also the only major structural parts that were made of wood. These were raised into position as eight pairs, and all were fixed into place within a week. Thanks to the simplicity of Paxton's design and the combined efficiency of the building contractor and their suppliers, the entire structure was assembled with extraordinary speed\u2014the team of 80 glaziers could fix more than 18,000 panes of sheet glass in a week<ref name=\"bl.uk\" />\u2014and the building was complete and ready to receive exhibits in just five months.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nWhen completed, the Crystal Palace provided an unrivaled space for exhibits, since it was essentially a self-supporting shell standing on slim iron columns, with no internal structural walls whatsoever. Because it was covered almost entirely in glass, it also needed no artificial lighting during the day, thereby reducing the Exhibition's running costs.\n\nFull-size elm trees growing in the park were enclosed within the central exhibition hall near the {{convert|27|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tall Crystal Fountain. However this caused a problem with [[Old World sparrow|sparrows]] becoming a nuisance and shooting was out of the question inside a glass building. [[Queen Victoria]] mentioned this problem to the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], who offered the solution, \"[[Eurasian sparrowhawk|Sparrowhawks]], Ma'am\".\n\nPaxton was acclaimed worldwide for his achievement, and was knighted by Queen Victoria in recognition of his work. The project was engineered by [[William Cubitt|Sir William Cubitt]]; Paxton's construction partner was the ironwork contractor [[Charles Fox (civil and railway engineer)|Sir Charles Fox]]'s Fox and Henderson, whose director Charles Fox was also knighted for his contribution. The 900,000 square feet (84,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) of glass was provided by the [[Chance Brothers]] glassworks in [[Smethwick]]. They were the only glassworks capable of fulfilling such a large order and had to bring in labour from France to meet it in time.<!--(The [[Hyde Park, London#Poem|Hyde Park]] article features a poem\n written about this construction.)--> The final dimensions were {{convert|1848|ft|m}} long by {{convert|456|ft|m}} wide.

There was also a 27-foot tall Crystal Fountain.\n\nIn the first week, the prices were \u00a31; then reduced to 5 shillings for the next three weeks, a price which still effectively limited entrance to middle-class and aristocratic visitors.

Described by Owen Jones, architect, and Joseph Bonomi, sculptor'. That which included a description of the dinosaurs was entitled: 'Geology and Inhabitants of the Ancient World. Described by Richard Owen, FRS. The animals constructed by B.W.Hawkins, FGS'. In the central transept was the 4,000-piece Grand Orchestra built around the 4,500-pipe Great Organ.

Over the years many world leaders visited and were accorded special festivals, with extended published programs. That for [[Garibaldi]] was entitled \"General Garibaldi's Italian Reception and Concert Saturday April 16, 1864\"; and that for the [[Shah]]: \"Crystal Palace. Grand F\u00eate in honour of His Majesty The Shah of Persia KG. Saturday July 6th\" (1889).  From the beginning general programs were printed, at first for the summer season, and then on a daily basis. So for instance that for the summer of 1864 \"Programme of arrangements for the eleventh season, commencing on the 1st May, 1864\" included the [[Shakespeare]] Tercentenary Festival and a course by designer [[Christopher Dresser]]. The daily \"Programme for Monday October 6th (1873) included a harvest exhibition of fruit, and the Australasian Collection, formed by H E Pain, of materials from Tasmania, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Australia, NZ; and grand military fete was also on offer. Many of these publications were printed by Dickens and Evans, that is Charles Dickens jnr., [[Dickens]]' son working with his father-in-law Frederick Evans.  Another feature of the early programming were Christmas pantomimes, with published librettos, for instance Harry Lemon's 'Dick Whittington and His Wonderful Cat. Crystal Palace Christmas 1869\u201370' (London 1869).\n\nIn 1868, the world's first aeronautical exhibition was held in the Crystal Palace.  In 1871, the world's first [[cat show]], organised by [[Harrison Weir]], was held there.

It astonished visitors with its clear walls and ceilings that did not require interior lights.\n\nIt has been suggested that the name of the building resulted from a piece penned by the playwright [[Douglas Jerrold]], who in July 1850 wrote in the satirical magazine ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' about the forthcoming Great Exhibition, referring to a \"palace of very crystal\".<ref>The ''Punch'' issue of 13 July 1850 carried a contribution by Douglas Jerrold, writing as Mrs Amelia Mouser, which referred to a ''palace of very crystal''.{{cite book |title=Douglas Jerrold') |author=Michael Slater |publisher=Duckworth |year=2002 |isbn=0-7156-2824-0 |page=243 |location=London}}. In fact the term \"Crystal Palace\" itself is used seven times in the same issue of Punch (pages iii. iv, 154, 183 (twice), 214 (twice) and 224.

Punch had originally sided with ''The Times'' against the exhibition committee's proposal of a fixed brick structure, but featured the Crystal Palace heavily throughout 1851 (for example in {{cite web |title=Punch Issue 502 |url=http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/luceneweb/hri3/display.jsp?mode=sciper&file=PU1-20.html&reveal=issue_PU1-20-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420155504/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/luceneweb/hri3/display.jsp?mode=sciper&file=PU1-20.html&reveal=issue_PU1-20-17 |archivedate=20 April 2006}} included the article \"Travels into the Interior of the Crystal Palace\" of February 1851).

It was rebuilt at the top of Penge Peak next to [[Sydenham Hill]], an affluent suburb of large villas. It stood there from June 1854 until its destruction by fire in November 1936. The nearby residential area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] after the landmark.  This included the [[Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounds the site, home of the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre]], which had previously been a football stadium that hosted the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Crystal Palace FA Cup Finals 1895.E2.80.931914|FA Cup Final]] between 1895 and 1914.

An executive Building Committee was quickly formed to oversee the design and construction of the exhibition building, comprising accomplished engineers [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] and [[Robert Stephenson]], renowned architects [[Charles Barry]] and [[Thomas Leverton Donaldson]], the [[Duke of Buccleuch]] and the [[Earl of Ellesmere]], and chaired by [[William Cubitt]]. By 15 March 1850 they were ready to invite submissions, which had to conform to several key specifications: the building had to be temporary, simple, as cheap as possible, and economical to build within the short time remaining before the Exhibition opening, which had already been scheduled for 1 May 1851.<ref name=\"Kate Colquhoun 2004\">Kate Colquhoun, ''A Thing in Disguise: The Visionary Life of Joseph Paxton'' (Harper Collins, 2004), Ch. 16</ref>\n\nWithin three weeks, the committee had received some 245 entries, including 38 international submissions from Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hanover, Switzerland, Brunswick, Hamburg and France.

Turner was furious at the rejection, and reportedly badgered the commissioners for months afterwards, seeking compensation, but at an estimated \u00a3300,000, his design (like Horeau's) was too expensive.<ref>Kate Colquhoun, ''A Thing in Disguise: The Visionary Life of Joseph Paxton'' (Harper Collins, 2004)</ref> As a last resort the committee came up with a standby design of its own, for a brick building in the ''[[rundbogenstil]]'' by Donaldson, featuring a sheet-iron dome designed by Brunel,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/1851/7.html|title=The Committee's design for a structure to house the Great Exhibition.|website=www.victorianweb.org}}</ref> but it was widely criticized and ridiculed when it was published in the newspapers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalpalacefoundation.org.uk/history/history-of-the-crystal-palace-part-1 |title=History of the Crystal Palace (part 1) |author=Jeremy Walker |publisher=Crystal Palace Foundation}}</ref> Adding to the Committee's woes, the site for the Exhibition was still not confirmed. The preferred site was in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], adjacent to Princes Gate near Kensington Rd, but other sites considered included [[Wormwood Scrubs]], [[Battersea Park]], the [[Isle of Dogs]], [[Victoria Park, London|Victoria Park]], and [[Regent's Park]]. Opponents of the scheme lobbied strenuously against the use of Hyde Park (and they were strongly supported by ''[[The Times]]''). The most outspoken critic was arch-conservative Col. [[Charles de Laet Waldo Sibthorp]]; he denounced the Exhibition as \"one of the greatest humbugs, frauds and absurdities ever known\",<ref name=\"Kate Colquhoun 2004\"/> and his trenchant opposition to both the Exhibition and its building continued even after it had closed.\n\n[[File:Gtexhib.jpg|thumb|Joseph Paxton's first sketch for the Great Exhibition Building, about 1850, pen and ink on blotting paper, V&A Museum]]\n\nAt this point renowned gardener [[Joseph Paxton]] became interested in the project, and with the enthusiastic backing of Commission member [[Henry Cole]], he decided to submit his own design. At this time, Paxton was chiefly known for his celebrated career as the head gardener for the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]] at [[Chatsworth House]], and by 1850 he had become a preeminent figure in British horticulture and had also earned great renown as a freelance garden designer; his works included the pioneering public gardens at [[Birkenhead Park]] which directly influenced the [[Frederick Law Olmsted#New York City's Central Park|design of New York's Central Park]]. At Chatsworth, Paxton had experimented extensively with glasshouse construction, developing many novel techniques for modular construction, using combinations of standard-sized sheets of glass, [[laminated wood]], and prefabricated cast iron. The \"Great Stove\" (or conservatory) at Chatsworth (built in 1836) was the first major application of Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof design, and was at the time the largest glass building in the world,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian/art/architecture/iron/21b.html|title=The Great Stove, Chatsworth|website=www.victorianweb.org}}</ref> covering around {{convert|28000|ft2}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/iron/21b.html|title=The Great Stove, Chatsworth|website=www.victorianweb.org}}</ref>\n\nA decade later, taking advantage of the availability of the new [[cast plate glass]], Paxton further developed his techniques with the Chatsworth Lily House, which featured a flat-roof version of the ridge-and-furrow glazing, and a [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] system that allowed the hanging of vertical bays of glass from cantilevered beams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=725|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203626/http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=725|url-status=dead|title=Engineering Timelines - Chatsworth Conservatory and Lily House, site of|archivedate=4 March 2016|website=www.engineering-timelines.com}}</ref> The Lily House was built specifically to house the giant ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'' waterlily which had only recently been discovered by European botanists; the first specimen to reach England was originally kept at [[Kew Gardens]], but it did not do well. Paxton's reputation as a gardener was so high by that time that he was invited to take the lily to Chatsworth; it thrived under his care and in 1849 he caused a sensation in the horticultural world when he succeeded in producing the first ''amazonica'' flowers to be grown in England (his daughter Alice was drawn for the newspapers, standing on one of leaves). The lily and its house led directly to Paxton's design for the Crystal Palace and he later cited the huge ribbed floating leaves as a key inspiration.<ref>[http://www.virtualherbarium.org/gardenviews/victoriaamazonica.html Jennifer Davit, \"Victoria: The Reigning Queen of Waterlilies\", Virtual Herbarium] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001651/http://www.virtualherbarium.org/gardenviews/victoriaamazonica.html |date=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nPaxton left his meeting with Henry Cole on 9 June 1850 fired with enthusiasm. He immediately went to Hyde Park, where he 'walked' the site earmarked for the Exhibition. Two days later, on 11 June, while attending a board meeting of the Midland Railway, Paxton made his original concept drawing, which he doodled onto a sheet of pink [[blotting paper]]. This rough sketch (now in the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]]) incorporated all the basic features of the finished building, and it is a mark of Paxton's ingenuity and industriousness that detailed plans, calculations and costings were ready to submit in less than two weeks.\n\nThe project was a major gamble for Paxton, but circumstances were in his favour: he enjoyed a stellar reputation as a garden designer and builder, he was confident that his design was perfectly suited to the brief, and the Commission was now under enormous pressure to choose a design and get it built, the Exhibition opening now being less than a year away. In the event, Paxton's design fulfilled and surpassed all the requirements, and it proved to be vastly faster and cheaper to build than any other form of building of a comparable size. Indeed, his submission was budgeted at a remarkably low \u00a385,800; by comparison, this was about 2-1/2 times more than the Great Stove at Chatsworth<ref>\"Paxton and the Great Stove\", ''Architectural History'', Vol. 4, (1961), pp. 77\u201392</ref> but it was only 28 percent of the estimated cost of Turner's design, and it promised a building which, with a footprint of over {{convert|770000|ft2|acre ha}}, would cover roughly 25 times the ground area of its progenitor.\n\nImpressed by the low bid for the construction contract submitted by the engineering firm [[Fox, Henderson and Co]], the commission accepted the scheme and finally gave its public endorsement to Paxton's design in July 1850. He was exultant, but now had less than eight months to finalize his plans, manufacture the parts and erect the building in time for the Exhibition's opening, which was scheduled for 1 May 1851. Paxton was able to design and build the largest glass structure yet created, from scratch, in less than a year, and complete it on schedule and on budget. He was even able to alter the design shortly before building began, adding a high, barrel-vaulted [[transept]] across the centre of the building, at 90 degrees to the main gallery, under which he was able to safely enclose several large elm trees that would otherwise have had to be felled\u2014thereby also resolving a controversial issue that had been a major sticking point for the vocal anti-Exhibition lobby.\n\n=== Design ===\n[[File:Crystal.Palace.Paxton.Plan.jpg|thumb|left|Partial front (left) and rear (right) elevations of the Crystal Palace]]\n\nPaxton's modular, hierarchical design reflected his practical brilliance as a designer and problem-solver. It incorporated many breakthroughs, offered practical advantages that no conventional building could match and, above all, embodied the spirit of British innovation and industrial might that the Great Exhibition was intended to celebrate.\n\nThe geometry of the Crystal Palace was a classic example of the concept of form following manufacturer's limitations: the shape and size of the whole building was directly based around the size of the panes of glass made by the supplier, [[Chance Brothers]] of Smethwick. These were the largest available at the time, measuring {{convert|10|in|cm}} wide by {{convert|49|in|cm}} long. Because the entire building was scaled around those dimensions, it meant that nearly the whole outer surface could be glazed using millions of identical panes, thereby drastically reducing both their production cost and the time needed to install them.\n\nThe original Hyde Park building was essentially a vast, flat-roofed rectangular hall. A huge open gallery ran along the main axis, with wings extending down either side. The main exhibition space was two stories high, with the upper floor stepped in from the boundary. Most of the building had a flat-profile roof, except for the central transept, which was covered by a {{convert|72|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} barrel-vaulted roof that stood {{convert|168|ft}} high at the top of the arch. Both the flat-profile sections and the arched transept roof were constructed using the key element of Paxton's design: his patented ridge-and-furrow roofing system, which had first seen use at Chatsworth. The basic roofing unit, in essence, took the form of a long triangular prism, which made it both extremely light and very strong, and meant it could be built with the minimum amount of materials.\n\nPaxton set the dimensions of this prism by using the length of single pane of glass ({{convert|49|in|cm}}) as the [[hypotenuse]] of a right-angled triangle, thereby creating a triangle with a length-to-height ratio of 2.5:1, whose base (adjacent side) was {{convert|4|ft}} long. By mirroring this triangle he obtained the {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} gables that formed the vertical faces at either end of the prism, each of which was {{convert|24|ft}} long. With this arrangement, Paxton could glaze the entire roof surface with identical panes that did not need to be trimmed. Paxton placed three of these {{convert|8|ft}} by {{convert|24|ft}} roof units side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars. The resulting cube, with a floor area of {{convert|24|ft}} by {{convert|24|ft}}, formed the basic structural module of the building.\n\nBy multiplying these modules into a grid, the structure could be extended virtually infinitely. In its original form, the ground level of the Crystal Palace (in plan) measured {{convert|1848|ft}} by {{convert|456|ft}}, which equates to a grid 77 modules long by 19 modules wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/london/model/geo.html|title=water|website=www2.iath.virginia.edu}}</ref> Because each module was self-supporting, Paxton was able to leave out modules in some areas, creating larger square or rectangular spaces within the building to accommodate larger exhibits. On the lower level, these larger spaces were covered by the floor above, and on the upper level by longer spans of roofing, but the dimensions of these larger spaces were always multiples of the basic {{convert|24|ft}} by {{convert|24|ft}} grid unit. The modules were also strong enough to be stacked vertically, enabling Paxton to add an upper floor that nearly doubled the amount of available exhibition space. Paxton also used longer trellis girders to create a clear span for the roof of the immense central gallery, which was {{convert|72|ft}} wide and {{convert|1800|ft}} long.\n\n[[File:Crystal Palace - plan.jpg|thumb|380px|Plan of the Crystal Palace]]\n\nPaxton's roofing system incorporated his elegant solution to the problem of draining the building's vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional. During construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering\u2014a patented design now widely known as a \"Paxton gutter\". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function: each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building.\n\nOne of the few issues Paxton could not completely solve was leaks\u2014when completed, rain was found to be leaking into the huge building in over a thousand places. The leaks were sealed with putty, but the relatively poor quality of the sealant materials available at the time meant that the problem was never totally overcome.\n\nTo maintain a comfortable temperature inside such a large glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely on the fact that they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions: they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards {{convert|22|cm|in}} wide, which were spaced about {{convert|1|cm|in}} apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Because of the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function: the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors at the end of each day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly.<ref name=\"bl.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106135.html|title=Sketch for the Crystal Palace|website=www.bl.uk}}</ref>\n\nThanks to the considerable economies of scale Paxton was able to exploit, the manufacture and assembly of the building parts was exceedingly quick and cheap. Each module was identical, fully prefabricated, self-supporting, and fast and easy to erect. All of the parts could be mass-produced in large numbers, and many parts served multiple functions, further reducing both the number of parts needed and their overall cost. Because of its comparatively low weight, the Crystal Palace required absolutely no heavy masonry for supporting walls or foundations, and the relatively light concrete footings on which it stood could be left in the ground once the building was removed (they remain in place today just beneath the surface of the site). The modules could be erected as quickly as the parts could reach the site\u2014indeed, some sections were standing within eighteen hours of leaving the factory\u2014and since each unit was self-supporting, workers were able to assemble much of the building section-by-section, without having to wait for other parts to be finished.\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:Crystal Palace - interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Crystal Palace]]\nFox, Henderson and co took possession of the site in July 1850 and erected wooden hoardings which were constructed using the timber that later became the floorboards of the finished building. More than 5,000 [[navvy|navvies]] worked on the building during its construction, with up to 2,000 on site at one time during the peak building phase.<ref>For the peak figure of 2,000 workers daily see: {{cite book |isbn=0-485-11575-1 |title=The Crystal Palace and the Great Exhibition |page=34 |author=Hermione Hobhouse. |year=2002 |publisher=Athlone |location=London}} and the University of Virginia's {{cite web |url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/allcach2k/Programme/session1.html |title=Modeling the Crystal Palace |year=2001}} project: {{cite web |url=http://www.iath.virginia.edu/london/model/animation.html# |title=''The Crystal Palace Animation'' Exterior and Interior |accessdate=20 November 2007}}</ref>\nMore than 1,000 iron columns supported 2,224 trellis girders and 30 miles of guttering, comprising 4,000 tons of iron in all.<ref name=\"bl.uk\" />\n\nFirstly stakes were driven into the ground to roughly mark out the positions for the cast iron columns; these points were then set precisely by [[theodolite]] measurements. Then the concrete foundations were poured, and the base plates for the columns were set into them. Once the foundations were in place, the erection of the modules proceeded rapidly. Connector brackets were attached to the top of each column before erection, and these were then hoisted into position. Since the project took place before the development of powered cranes, the raising of the columns was done manually using [[Shear legs|shears]] (or shear legs), a simple crane mechanism. These consisted of two strong poles, which were set several meters apart at the base and then lashed together at the top to form a triangle; this was stabilized and kept vertical by guy ropes fixed to the apex, stretched taut and tied to stakes driven into the ground some distance away. Using pulleys and ropes hung from the apex of the shear, the navvies hoisted the columns, girders and other parts into place.\n\nAs soon as two adjacent columns had been erected, a girder was hoisted into place between them and bolted onto the connectors. The columns were erected in opposite pairs, then two more girders were connected to form a self-supporting square\u2014this was the basic frame of each module. The shears would then be moved along and an adjoining bay constructed. When a reasonable number of bays had been completed, the columns for the upper floor were erected (longer shear-legs were used for this, but the operation was essentially the same as for the ground floor). Once the ground floor structure was complete, the final assembly of the upper floor followed rapidly.\n\nFor the glazing, Paxton used larger versions of machines he had originally devised for the Great Stove at Chatsworth, installing on-site [[production line]] systems, powered by steam engines, that dressed and finished the building parts. These included a machine that mechanically grooved the wooden window sash bars, and a painting machine that automatically dipped the parts in paint and then passed them through a series of rotating brushes to remove the excess.\n[[File:Crystal Palace Great Exhibition tree 1851.png|thumb|A tree enclosed within the Crystal Palace]]\n\nThe last major components to be put into place were the sixteen semi-circular ribs of the vaulted transept, which were also the only major structural parts that were made of wood. These were raised into position as eight pairs, and all were fixed into place within a week. Thanks to the simplicity of Paxton's design and the combined efficiency of the building contractor and their suppliers, the entire structure was assembled with extraordinary speed\u2014the team of 80 glaziers could fix more than 18,000 panes of sheet glass in a week<ref name=\"bl.uk\" />\u2014and the building was complete and ready to receive exhibits in just five months.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nWhen completed, the Crystal Palace provided an unrivaled space for exhibits, since it was essentially a self-supporting shell standing on slim iron columns, with no internal structural walls whatsoever. Because it was covered almost entirely in glass, it also needed no artificial lighting during the day, thereby reducing the Exhibition's running costs.\n\nFull-size elm trees growing in the park were enclosed within the central exhibition hall near the {{convert|27|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tall Crystal Fountain. However this caused a problem with [[Old World sparrow|sparrows]] becoming a nuisance and shooting was out of the question inside a glass building. [[Queen Victoria]] mentioned this problem to the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], who offered the solution, \"[[Eurasian sparrowhawk|Sparrowhawks]], Ma'am\".\n\nPaxton was acclaimed worldwide for his achievement, and was knighted by Queen Victoria in recognition of his work. The project was engineered by [[William Cubitt|Sir William Cubitt]]; Paxton's construction partner was the ironwork contractor [[Charles Fox (civil and railway engineer)|Sir Charles Fox]]'s Fox and Henderson, whose director Charles Fox was also knighted for his contribution. The 900,000 square feet (84,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) of glass was provided by the [[Chance Brothers]] glassworks in [[Smethwick]]. They were the only glassworks capable of fulfilling such a large order and had to bring in labour from France to meet it in time.<!--(The [[Hyde Park, London#Poem|Hyde Park]] article features a poem\n written about this construction.)--> The final dimensions were {{convert|1848|ft|m}} long by {{convert|456|ft|m}} wide.

The exhibits ranged from the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond, [[Sevres porcelain]] and [[Organ (music)|music organs]] to a massive hydraulic press and a fire-engine. There was also a 27-foot tall Crystal Fountain.\n\nIn the first week, the prices were \u00a31; then reduced to 5 shillings for the next three weeks, a price which still effectively limited entrance to middle-class and aristocratic visitors. The working classes finally came to the exhibition on Monday 26 May, when weekday prices were reduced to one shilling (although the price was two shillings and sixpence on Fridays, and still 5 shillings on Saturdays).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wJdDAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22exhibition%20of%201851%22&pg=PA85#v=onepage&q=%22exhibition%20of%201851%22&f=false|title=...

From the beginning general programs were printed, at first for the summer season, and then on a daily basis. So for instance that for the summer of 1864 \"Programme of arrangements for the eleventh season, commencing on the 1st May, 1864\" included the [[Shakespeare]] Tercentenary Festival and a course by designer [[Christopher Dresser]]. The daily \"Programme for Monday October 6th (1873) included a harvest exhibition of fruit, and the Australasian Collection, formed by H E Pain, of materials from Tasmania, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Australia, NZ; and grand military fete was also on offer. Many of these publications were printed by Dickens and Evans, that is Charles Dickens jnr., [[Dickens]]' son working with his father-in-law Frederick Evans.  Another feature of the early programming were Christmas pantomimes, with published librettos, for instance Harry Lemon's 'Dick Whittington and His Wonderful Cat.

The tail is half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body and laterally compressed. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low, smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\nAlpine newts are blackish\u2013grey to bluish on the sides and the back, while their belly is an unspotted orange. Males also have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Females are of a more drab, mottled colour than males. Body shape and colour differ slightly among the subspecies.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u20138 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|4-5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are usually light brown-yellow and darker towards the tail, which ends in a small, pointed filament.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768, as ''Triton alpestris'' from mount [[\u00d6tscher]] in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin), by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]].{{r|Laurenti1768}} Laurenti thought that males, females and larvae were different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. As this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages, the alpine newt was split off as [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, it was argued that a gilled newt Laurenti had described as ''Proteus tritonius'' in fact represented a larva of the alpine newt. The name ''Ichthyosaura'', introduced by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] in 1801 for that larva,{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}}\n\n==Distribution and subspecies==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe. It is relatively common over a large, more or less continuous range from northwestern France to the [[Carpathians]] in Romania, and from southern Denmark in the north to the [[Alps]] and France just north of the Mediterranean in the south, but absent from the [[Pannonian basin]]. Isolated areas of distribution exist in Spain, Italy and Greece.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=39-46|3=RecueroBuckley2014|4=Raffaelli2018}} Populations have been deliberately [[Introduced species|introduced]] to various places in continental Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\nA number of geographic [[subspecies]] have been described, but many were not recognised by later authors. Differences in shape and colour are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} The ''Handbook of the Amphibians and Reptiles of Europe'' (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} followed by later authors,{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} recognised four subspecies (see table below). [[Molecular phylogenetics]] confirmed five distinct lineages, which correspond only in part to these subspecies: The western populations of the [[nominate subspecies]] ''I. a. alpestris'', together with the [[Cantabrian]] ''I. a. cyreni'' and the [[Apennines|Apennine]] ''I. a. apuana'' form one group, while the eastern populations are genetically closer to the Greek ''I. a. veluchiensis''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Several authors argued that these ancient lineages might even represent [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} An article from 2018 accepted four species,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this has been considered premature in ''Amphibian Species of the World''.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n! colspan=2; style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Subspecies{{r|1=Rocek2003|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=214|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=16-36}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Distribution !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Alternative classification{{r|Raffaelli2018}}\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| rowspan=2 | ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|Laurenti, 1768}}<br>\u2013 Alpine newt || western populations || Northwestern France to northern [[Carpathians]] in Romania; southern Denmark in the north; Alps and France north of the Mediterranean in the south || Subspecies ''I. alpestris alpestris''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| eastern populations || [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece to Bulgaria and southern Carpathians in Romania || Species ''I. reiseri'', with subspecies ''reiseri'', ''carpathica'' and ''montenegrina''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|Gray, 1850}}<br>\u2013 Apennine alpine newt || Extreme southeastern France, Apennines to [[Lazio]] in central Italy, isolated populations in [[Calabria]] || Species ''I. apuana'', with subspecies ''apuana'' and ''inexpectata'' (Calabria)\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|Mertens & Muller, 1940}}<br>\u2013 Cantabrian alpine newt || Spain: Cantabrian mountains and [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] (introduced) || Subspecies ''I. alpestris cyreni''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|Wolterstorff, 1935}}<br>\u2013 Greek alpine newt || Greece: mainland and northern [[Peloponnese]] || Species ''I. veluchiensis''\n\n|}\n\n==Habitats==\n\nThe alpine newt can occur at high elevation and has been found up to {{convert|2370|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] in the Alps. However, it does occur in the lowlands down to sea level. Towards the south of its range, most populations are found above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=51-59}}\n\nForests, including both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests (but avoiding pure [[Picea abies|spruce]] plantations), are the main land habitat. Less common are forest edges, [[brownfield land]], or gardens. Populations can be found above [[tree line]] in the high mountains, where they prefer south-exposed slopes. The newts use logs, stones, leaf litter, [[burrow]]s, [[construction waste]] or similar structures as hiding places.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=54-59}}\n\nAquatic breeding sites close to suitable land habitat are critical. While small, cool water bodies in forested areas are preferred, alpine newts tolerate a wide range of permanent or [[vernal pool|non-permanent]], natural or human-made water bodies. These can range from shallow puddles over small ponds to larger, fish-free lakes or reservoirs and quiet parts of streams. Damming by [[Eurasian beaver|beavers]] creates valuable breeding sites. Overall, the alpine newt is tolerant regarding chemical parameters such as [[pH]], [[water hardness]] and [[eutrophication]]. Other European newts such as the [[Northern crested newt|crested]], [[Smooth newt|smooth]], [[Palmate newt|palmate]] or [[Carpathian newt]] often use the same breeding sites, but are less common at higher elevation.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=47-54}}\n\n==Life and behaviour==\n\nAlpine newts are usually [[semiaquatic]], spending most of the year (9-10 months) on land and only returning to the water for breeding. The juvenile [[eft]]s are probably terrestrial throughout the year.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=54}} They reach [[sexual maturity]] at around three years in males, and four to five years in females, and can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n===Terrestrial phase===\n\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nOn land, alpine newts are mainly nocturnal, hiding most of the day and moving and feeding during the night or in the [[twighlight]]. They have been observed to climb up to {{convert|2|m|ft}} high vertical walls on wet nights. [[Hibernation]] also usually takes place in hiding places on land.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=105-107}} Migration to breeding sites occurs on sufficiently warm (above 5 \u00b0C) and humid nights and may be delayed or interrupted for several weeks in unfavourable conditions. The newts can also leave the water again in case of a sudden cold snap.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=89-90}}\n\nAlpine newts tend to stay close to their breeding sites and only a small proportion, mainly juveniles, [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to new habitats. A dispersal distance of {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been observed, but this is considered uncommon. Over short distances, the newts use mainly their smell for [[animal navigation|navigation]], while over long distances, orientation by the night sky, and potentially through [[magnetoreception]] are more important.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=122-128}} \n\n===Aquatic phase and breeding===\n\nThe aquatic phase starts as soon as ice starts to disappear, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=87-90}} Some southern populations in Greece and Italy appear to stay aquatic most of the year and hibernate under water.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=104-105}} Two rounds of breeding and egg-laying, in autumn and spring, have been observed in the Apennine subspecies, ''I. a. apuana''.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv | thumb | right | Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Males perform a [[courtship display]], which differs somewhat from other newt species. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while and, fans his tail to stimulate the female and wave [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with displays of rivals.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}} Experiments suggested that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}} In a breeding season, a male can produce more than 48 spermatophores, and offspring from one female has usually several fathers.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=83-86}}\n\nFemales wrap their eggs in leaves of water plants for protection, preferring leaves closer to the surface where temperatures are higher. Where no plants are available, they may also use leaf litter, dead wood or stones for egg deposition.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=94-104}} They lay 70\u2013390 eggs in a season, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (2.5\u20133 mm including the jelly capsule). Incubation time is longer under cold conditions, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}} The larvae are [[benthic]], staying in general close to the bottom of the water body.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=98}} [[Metamorphosis]] occurs after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}}\n\n===Paedomorphy===\n\n[[File:Mesotriton alpestris apuanus04.jpg | thumb | right | Paedomorphic adult (above) and larva (below) of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n\n[[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults do not metamorphose and instead retain their [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is more common in the alpine newt than in other European newts. It is almost exclusively found in the southern part of the range (but not in the Cantabrian subspecies, ''I. a. cyreni''). Paedomorphic adults are more pale in colour than metamorphic ones. Only part of the population is usually paedomorphic, and metamorphosis can follow if the pool dries out. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts sometimes prefer different prey, but they do interbreed. Overall, paedomorphy appears to be a facultative strategy under particular conditions which are not fully understood.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=60-65}}\n\n===Diet, predators and parasites===\n\nAlpine newts are diet generalists, taking mainly different [[invertebrates]] as prey. Larvae and adults living in the water eat various [[plankton]], larvae of insects such as [[chironomids]], crustaceans such as [[ostracods]] or [[amphipods]], and terrestrial insects falling on the surface. Amphibian eggs and larvae, including the same species, are also eaten. Prey on land includes various insects, worms, spiders or [[isopods]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=68-72}}\n\n[[Predator]]s taking adult alpine newts are snakes such as the [[grass snake]], fish such as [[trout]], birds such as [[heron]]s or [[duck]]s, and mammals such as [[hedgehogs]], [[marten]]s or [[shrew]]s. Under water, large diving beetles (''[[Dytiscus]]'') can kill newts, while small juveniles on land may be predated by ground beetles (''[[Carabus]]''). For eggs and larvae, diving beetles, fish, [[dragonfly]] larvae, and other newts are the main enemies.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=73-77}}\n\nThreatened adult newts often take on a defence position, where they expose the [[aposematism|warning colour]] of their belly by bending backwards or raising their tail. They also sometimes emit sounds, whose function is however unknown.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}}\n\nParasites include [[parasitic worm]]s, [[leeches]], the ciliate ''[[Balantidium elongatum]]'', and potentially [[Lucilia bufonivora|toadflies]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=77}} A [[ranavirus]] transmitted to alpine newts from [[midwife toad]]s in Spain caused bleeding and [[necrosis]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=142}} The [[chytridiomycosis]]-causing fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' has been found in wild populations,<ref name=\"ZampigliaCanestrelli2013\"/> and the emerging ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|B. salamandrivorans]]'' was lethal for alpine newts in laboratory experiments.<ref name=\"MartelBlooi2014\"/>\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt [[population]]s have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular phylogenetic]] estimate.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Fossil remains of the alpine newt were found in the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be its [[sister species]].{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nAnalyses showed that populations fall into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which only in part correspond to described [[subspecies]] (see below).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the [[Miocene]] or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial DNA]] show different population structures, which may results from [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages. The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of population retreat, expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt is classified as [[Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]]; the population trend however is \"Decreasing\".{{r|iucn}} Threats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats, as well as the introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]], to breeding sites.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}} In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by [[chytridiomycosis]],{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, [[eradication]] was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3-4 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BondNHSN\">{{cite url | last1 = Bond | first1 = I. | title = Alpine Newt | year = 2020 | publisher = Natural History Society of Northumbria | url = https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ | accessdate = 5 April 2020 | archiveurl = | archive-date = 22 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190922004603/https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ cite web |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

The tail is half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body and laterally compressed. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low, smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\nAlpine newts are blackish\u2013grey to bluish on the sides and the back, while their belly is an unspotted orange. Males also have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Females are of a more drab, mottled colour than males. Body shape and colour differ slightly among the subspecies.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u20138 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|4-5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are usually light brown-yellow and darker towards the tail, which ends in a small, pointed filament.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768, as ''Triton alpestris'' from mount [[\u00d6tscher]] in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin), by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]].{{r|Laurenti1768}} Laurenti thought that males, females and larvae were different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. As this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages, the alpine newt was split off as [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, it was argued that a gilled newt Laurenti had described as ''Proteus tritonius'' in fact represented a larva of the alpine newt. The name ''Ichthyosaura'', introduced by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] in 1801 for that larva,{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}}\n\n==Distribution and subspecies==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe. It is relatively common over a large, more or less continuous range from northwestern France to the [[Carpathians]] in Romania, and from southern Denmark in the north to the [[Alps]] and France just north of the Mediterranean in the south, but absent from the [[Pannonian basin]]. Isolated areas of distribution exist in Spain, Italy and Greece.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=39-46|3=RecueroBuckley2014|4=Raffaelli2018}} Populations have been deliberately [[Introduced species|introduced]] to various places in continental Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\nA number of geographic [[subspecies]] have been described, but many were not recognised by later authors. Differences in shape and colour are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} The ''Handbook of the Amphibians and Reptiles of Europe'' (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} followed by later authors,{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} recognised four subspecies (see table below). [[Molecular phylogenetics]] confirmed five distinct lineages, which correspond only in part to these subspecies: The western populations of the [[nominate subspecies]] ''I. a. alpestris'', together with the [[Cantabrian]] ''I. a. cyreni'' and the [[Apennines|Apennine]] ''I. a. apuana'' form one group, while the eastern populations are genetically closer to the Greek ''I. a. veluchiensis''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Several authors argued that these ancient lineages might even represent [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} An article from 2018 accepted four species,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this has been considered premature in ''Amphibian Species of the World''.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n! colspan=2; style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Subspecies{{r|1=Rocek2003|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=214|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=16-36}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Distribution !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Alternative classification{{r|Raffaelli2018}}\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| rowspan=2 | ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|Laurenti, 1768}}<br>\u2013 Alpine newt || western populations || Northwestern France to northern [[Carpathians]] in Romania; southern Denmark in the north; Alps and France north of the Mediterranean in the south || Subspecies ''I. alpestris alpestris''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| eastern populations || [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece to Bulgaria and southern Carpathians in Romania || Species ''I. reiseri'', with subspecies ''reiseri'', ''carpathica'' and ''montenegrina''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|Gray, 1850}}<br>\u2013 Apennine alpine newt || Extreme southeastern France, Apennines to [[Lazio]] in central Italy, isolated populations in [[Calabria]] || Species ''I. apuana'', with subspecies ''apuana'' and ''inexpectata'' (Calabria)\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|Mertens & Muller, 1940}}<br>\u2013 Cantabrian alpine newt || Spain: Cantabrian mountains and [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] (introduced) || Subspecies ''I. alpestris cyreni''\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|Wolterstorff, 1935}}<br>\u2013 Greek alpine newt || Greece: mainland and northern [[Peloponnese]] || Species ''I. veluchiensis''\n\n|}\n\n==Habitats==\n\nThe alpine newt can occur at high elevation and has been found up to {{convert|2370|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] in the Alps. However, it does occur in the lowlands down to sea level. Towards the south of its range, most populations are found above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=51-59}}\n\nForests, including both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests (but avoiding pure [[Picea abies|spruce]] plantations), are the main land habitat. Less common are forest edges, [[brownfield land]], or gardens. Populations can be found above [[tree line]] in the high mountains, where they prefer south-exposed slopes. The newts use logs, stones, leaf litter, [[burrow]]s, [[construction waste]] or similar structures as hiding places.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=54-59}}\n\nAquatic breeding sites close to suitable land habitat are critical. While small, cool water bodies in forested areas are preferred, alpine newts tolerate a wide range of permanent or [[vernal pool|non-permanent]], natural or human-made water bodies. These can range from shallow puddles over small ponds to larger, fish-free lakes or reservoirs and quiet parts of streams. Damming by [[Eurasian beaver|beavers]] creates valuable breeding sites. Overall, the alpine newt is tolerant regarding chemical parameters such as [[pH]], [[water hardness]] and [[eutrophication]]. Other European newts such as the [[Northern crested newt|crested]], [[Smooth newt|smooth]], [[Palmate newt|palmate]] or [[Carpathian newt]] often use the same breeding sites, but are less common at higher elevation.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=47-54}}\n\n==Life and behaviour==\n\nAlpine newts are usually [[semiaquatic]], spending most of the year (9-10 months) on land and only returning to the water for breeding. The juvenile [[eft]]s are probably terrestrial throughout the year.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=54}} They reach [[sexual maturity]] at around three years in males, and four to five years in females, and can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n===Terrestrial phase===\n\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nOn land, alpine newts are mainly nocturnal, hiding most of the day and moving and feeding during the night or in the [[twighlight]]. They have been observed to climb up to {{convert|2|m|ft}} high vertical walls on wet nights. [[Hibernation]] also usually takes place in hiding places on land.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=105-107}} Migration to breeding sites occurs on sufficiently warm (above 5 \u00b0C) and humid nights and may be delayed or interrupted for several weeks in unfavourable conditions. The newts can also leave the water again in case of a sudden cold snap.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=89-90}}\n\nAlpine newts tend to stay close to their breeding sites and only a small proportion, mainly juveniles, [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to new habitats. A dispersal distance of {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been observed, but this is considered uncommon. Over short distances, the newts use mainly their smell for [[animal navigation|navigation]], while over long distances, orientation by the night sky, and potentially through [[magnetoreception]] are more important.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=122-128}} \n\n===Aquatic phase and breeding===\n\nThe aquatic phase starts as soon as ice starts to disappear, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=87-90}} Some southern populations in Greece and Italy appear to stay aquatic most of the year and hibernate under water.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=104-105}} Two rounds of breeding and egg-laying, in autumn and spring, have been observed in the Apennine subspecies, ''I. a. apuana''.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv | thumb | right | Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Males perform a [[courtship display]], which differs somewhat from other newt species. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while and, fans his tail to stimulate the female and wave [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with displays of rivals.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}} Experiments suggested that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}} In a breeding season, a male can produce more than 48 spermatophores, and offspring from one female has usually several fathers.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=83-86}}\n\nFemales wrap their eggs in leaves of water plants for protection, preferring leaves closer to the surface where temperatures are higher. Where no plants are available, they may also use leaf litter, dead wood or stones for egg deposition.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=94-104}} They lay 70\u2013390 eggs in a season, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (2.5\u20133 mm including the jelly capsule). Incubation time is longer under cold conditions, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}} The larvae are [[benthic]], staying in general close to the bottom of the water body.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=98}} [[Metamorphosis]] occurs after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}}\n\n===Paedomorphy===\n\n[[File:Mesotriton alpestris apuanus04.jpg | thumb | right | Paedomorphic adult (above) and larva (below) of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n\n[[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults do not metamorphose and instead retain their [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is more common in the alpine newt than in other European newts. It is almost exclusively found in the southern part of the range (but not in the Cantabrian subspecies, ''I. a. cyreni''). Paedomorphic adults are more pale in colour than metamorphic ones. Only part of the population is usually paedomorphic, and metamorphosis can follow if the pool dries out. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts sometimes prefer different prey, but they do interbreed. Overall, paedomorphy appears to be a facultative strategy under particular conditions which are not fully understood.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=60-65}}\n\n===Diet, predators and parasites===\n\nAlpine newts are diet generalists, taking mainly different [[invertebrates]] as prey. Larvae and adults living in the water eat various [[plankton]], larvae of insects such as [[chironomids]], crustaceans such as [[ostracods]] or [[amphipods]], and terrestrial insects falling on the surface. Amphibian eggs and larvae, including the same species, are also eaten. Prey on land includes various insects, worms, spiders or [[isopods]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=68-72}}\n\n[[Predator]]s taking adult alpine newts are snakes such as the [[grass snake]], fish such as [[trout]], birds such as [[heron]]s or [[duck]]s, and mammals such as [[hedgehogs]], [[marten]]s or [[shrew]]s. Under water, large diving beetles (''[[Dytiscus]]'') can kill newts, while small juveniles on land may be predated by ground beetles (''[[Carabus]]''). For eggs and larvae, diving beetles, fish, [[dragonfly]] larvae, and other newts are the main enemies.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=73-77}}\n\nThreatened adult newts often take on a defence position, where they expose the [[aposematism|warning colour]] of their belly by bending backwards or raising their tail. They also sometimes emit sounds, whose function is however unknown.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}}\n\nParasites include [[parasitic worm]]s, [[leeches]], the ciliate ''[[Balantidium elongatum]]'', and potentially [[Lucilia bufonivora|toadflies]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=77}} A [[ranavirus]] transmitted to alpine newts from [[midwife toad]]s in Spain caused bleeding and [[necrosis]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=142}} The [[chytridiomycosis]]-causing fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' has been found in wild populations,<ref name=\"ZampigliaCanestrelli2013\"/> and the emerging ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|B. salamandrivorans]]'' was lethal for alpine newts in laboratory experiments.<ref name=\"MartelBlooi2014\"/>\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt [[population]]s have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular phylogenetic]] estimate.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Fossil remains of the alpine newt were found in the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be its [[sister species]].{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nAnalyses showed that populations fall into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which only in part correspond to described [[subspecies]] (see below).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the [[Miocene]] or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial DNA]] show different population structures, which may results from [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages. The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of population retreat, expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt is classified as [[Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]]; the population trend however is \"Decreasing\".{{r|iucn}} Threats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats, as well as the introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]], to breeding sites.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}} In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by [[chytridiomycosis]],{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, [[eradication]] was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3-4 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BondNHSN\">{{cite url | last1 = Bond | first1 = I. | title = Alpine Newt | year = 2020 | publisher = Natural History Society of Northumbria | url = https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ | accessdate = 5 April 2020 | archiveurl = | archive-date = 22 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190922004603/https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ cite web |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).
