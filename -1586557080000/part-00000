The [[President of Cyprus]], [[Direct election|directly elected]] in the [[Midterm election|middle]] of the legislative term, is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], presiding over the executive [[Council of Ministers (Cyprus)|Council of Ministers]]. The [[multi-member district|multi-member]] [[proportional representation|proportional]] elections to the [[House of Representatives (Cyprus)|House of Representatives]] however accommodate a [[multi-party system]], where the elected president's party usually joins forces with smaller parties to form a joint [[coalition government]] that usually adapts to parliamentary shifts after legislative elections.\n\n===Electoral system===\n{{main|Elections in Cyprus}}\n\nThe 80 seats in the House of Representatives are elected from six multi-member constituencies, with the number of seats allocated according to the population of each area. Of the 80 seats, 56 are elected by [[Greek Cypriots]] and 24 by [[Turkish Cypriots]]. However, due to the partition of the island in 1974, the 24 Turkish Cypriot seats are unfilled and the House of Representatives has de facto had 56 seats since its enlargement in the 1980s.\n\nThe elections are held using [[open list]] [[proportional representation]], with seats allocated using the [[Hare quota]]. Any remaining seats are allocated to lists that won at least one seat or parties that received at least 3.6% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in-cyprus.com/electoral-threshold-at-3-6/|title=Electoral threshold at 3.6%|work=InCyprus|accessdate=24 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502141911/http://in-cyprus.com/electoral-threshold-at-3-6/|archive-date=2 May 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the open list system, voters first select the list they want to vote for, and then select a number of candidates equal to a quarter of the number of seats in the constituency. Party leaders or other candidates heading coalitions are not required to receive preferential votes to be elected. <ref>[http://ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2081_B.htm Electoral system] IPU</ref> Although [[Compulsory voting|compulsory voting]] had not been formally abolished at the time the elections took place (it was abolished in 2017), the law had not been enforced for years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cyprus-mail.com/2017/05/31/government-abolishes-compulsory-voting/|title=Government abolishes compulsory voting|date=2017-05-31|website=Cyprus Mail|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===2011===\nThe [[2011 Cypriot legislative election|previous legislative election]] took place on 22 May 2011. President [[Demetris Christofias]] of the communist [[Progressive Party of Working People]] (AKEL) had led a coalition consisting of his party as well as the centrist [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]] (DIKO) and the social-democratic [[Movement for Social Democracy]] (EDEK) since his [[2008 Cypriot presidential election|election in 2008]].\n\nAfter three years in power, AKEL scored 32.7% in the 2011 legislative elections, narrowly behind the opposition center-right [[Democratic Rally]], which polled 34.3% of votes. Meanwhile, AKEL's partners DIKO and EDEK scored 15.8% and 8.9% respectively. A mere two months after the legislative election, the [[Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion]] took place, triggering calls for President [[Demetris Christofias|Christofias]]' resignation.\n\n===2013===\nAmidst widespread dissatisfaction and a deepening [[European sovereign debt crisis|economic crisis]], Christofias announced that he would not run for a second term in the [[2013 Cypriot presidential election|presidential election in 2013]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyprus-president-idUSBRE84D0VT20120514|title=Cyprus president says will not seek re-election|author=Michele Kambas|date=14 May 2012|work=Reuters|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> Ultimately, [[Nicos Anastasiades]] of DISY emerged victorious in the presidential election, taking 45.5% of the vote, against 26.9% for the AKEL-backed [[Stavros Malas]] and the EDEK-backed [[Giorgos Lillikas]]. In the second round, Anastasiades captured 57.5% to 42.5% for Malas. The [[Cabinet of Cyprus|Anastasiades administration]] took office on 28 February 2013, comprising DISY, DIKO and the [[European Party (Cyprus)|European Party]] (EVROKO). The Democrats later pulled out of the coalition, however.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://famagusta-gazette.com/diko-decides-to-leave-cyprus-government-coalition-p22474-69.htm|title=DIKO decides to leave Cyprus government coalition|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===2014===\nRoughly a year into the presidency of [[Nicos Anastasiades]], the Cypriot parties faced the electorate in [[2014 European Parliament election in Cyprus|European Parliament elections]]. Ahead of the election, DISY and EVROKO announced that they would participate in the election on a joint ticket; the social democrats in EDEK and the [[Ecological and Environmental Movement]] (KOP) also formed an [[electoral coalition|electoral pact]] for the event. With the economic problems the country faced under [[Demetris Christofias]]' AKEL-led government fresh in the minds of voters, the party plummeted to 27.0% of the vote, a loss of 8.4% points. Meanwhile, the DISY-EVROKO pact garnered 37.8%. This election also served as the first electoral test of the [[Citizens' Alliance (Cyprus)|Citizens' Alliance]] (SYPOL) party of former presidential candidate [[Giorgos Lillikas]], which polled 6.8% but failed to win seats in the [[European Parliament]]. The decline of AKEL and the rise of anti-establishment parties continued into 2015 and 2016.<ref>http://paperroom.ipsa.org/papers/paper_11548.pdf</ref>\n\n===2016===\nMere months before the 2016 legislative election, ex-DISY [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Eleni Theocharous]] launched a splinter party, in opposition to Anastasiades' approach to the [[Cyprus issue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/01/15/theocharous-unveils-solidarity-platform-to-save-republic/|title=Theocharous unveils Solidarity platform to \u2018save Republic\u2019|date=15 January 2016|work=Cyprus Mail|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> She advocated for tighter co-operation with other parties particularly DIKO and EDEK.

Papadopoulos claimed that \"behind closed doors\", AKEL was trying to resurrect the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|2004 Annan plan]] that was turned down by the Greek side in a [[2004 Cypriot Annan Plan referendums|referendum]]. While Neophytou and Papadopoulos criticized AKEL's judgment of the economic situation ahead of the [[2012\u201313 Cypriot financial crisis]], Kyprianou recalled his two rivals' assessments at that time. Back then in October 2008, Neophytou had expected things to go \"very well\", though \"based on overconsumption\", while Papadopoulos had gone even further off the mark stating: \"Yes, our economy will be impacted, but certainly not our financial system, which is one of the most resilient in the world.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Angelos Anastasiou |title=Election campaign heats up on economy issues |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]] |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/05/19/election-campaign-heats-economy-issues/ |date=19 May 2016 |accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Opinion polls==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; line-height:16px; margin-bottom:0\"\n| colspan=13| [[File:Polling for 2016 Cyprus election.png|750px]]\n|- style=\"height:42px; background:#e9e9e9;\"\n!

AKEL was seen as the biggest loser of the election, possible reasons being cited as the party's failure to take up a \"proactive\" role and continued disillusionment with the Christofias administration. In contrast, an AKEL member, [[Irini Charalambidou]], gained the highest number of votes for any candidate, following her stark critique of and fight against failing banks. The results were interpreted as a weakening of the front calling for a federal solution by the Turkish Cypriot press and political analyst Louis Igoumenides. Whilst the pro-solution parties, DISY and AKEL, still received a combined 56% of the votes against 40% obtained by anti-solution parties, in the case of a referendum the \"yes\" vote was expected by Igoumenides to be much lower, partly due to the refusal of fanatic voters of DISY and AKEL to collaborate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cyprus parliamentary vote puts far-right in parliament|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyprus-election-idUSKCN0YD0R4|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=cmail>{{cite web|last1=Hazou|first1=Elias|title=Election outcome doesn\u2019t bode well for settlement, political observer says|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/05/23/election-outcome-doest-bode-well-settlement-political-observer-says/|publisher=Cyprus Mail|accessdate=23 May 2016|date=23 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of economics, the Anastasiades government became dependent on smaller parties in order to pass important reforms.

The [[President of Cyprus]], [[Direct election|directly elected]] in the [[Midterm election|middle]] of the legislative term, is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], presiding over the executive [[Council of Ministers (Cyprus)|Council of Ministers]]. The [[multi-member district|multi-member]] [[proportional representation|proportional]] elections to the [[House of Representatives (Cyprus)|House of Representatives]] however accommodate a [[multi-party system]], where the elected president's party usually joins forces with smaller parties to form a joint [[coalition government]] that usually adapts to parliamentary shifts after legislative elections.\n\n===Electoral system===\n{{main|Elections in Cyprus}}\n\nThe 80 seats in the House of Representatives are elected from six multi-member constituencies, with the number of seats allocated according to the population of each area. Of the 80 seats, 56 are elected by [[Greek Cypriots]] and 24 by [[Turkish Cypriots]]. However, due to the partition of the island in 1974, the 24 Turkish Cypriot seats are unfilled and the House of Representatives has de facto had 56 seats since its enlargement in the 1980s.\n\nThe elections are held using [[open list]] [[proportional representation]], with seats allocated using the [[Hare quota]]. Any remaining seats are allocated to lists that won at least one seat or parties that received at least 3.6% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in-cyprus.com/electoral-threshold-at-3-6/|title=Electoral threshold at 3.6%|work=InCyprus|accessdate=24 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502141911/http://in-cyprus.com/electoral-threshold-at-3-6/|archive-date=2 May 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the open list system, voters first select the list they want to vote for, and then select a number of candidates equal to a quarter of the number of seats in the constituency.

President [[Demetris Christofias]] of the communist [[Progressive Party of Working People]] (AKEL) had led a coalition consisting of his party as well as the centrist [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]] (DIKO) and the social-democratic [[Movement for Social Democracy]] (EDEK) since his [[2008 Cypriot presidential election|election in 2008]].\n\nAfter three years in power, AKEL scored 32.7% in the 2011 legislative elections, narrowly behind the opposition center-right [[Democratic Rally]], which polled 34.3% of votes. Meanwhile, AKEL's partners DIKO and EDEK scored 15.8% and 8.9% respectively. A mere two months after the legislative election, the [[Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion]] took place, triggering calls for President [[Demetris Christofias|Christofias]]' resignation.\n\n===2013===\nAmidst widespread dissatisfaction and a deepening [[European sovereign debt crisis|economic crisis]], Christofias announced that he would not run for a second term in the [[2013 Cypriot presidential election|presidential election in 2013]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyprus-president-idUSBRE84D0VT20120514|title=Cyprus president says will not seek re-election|author=Michele Kambas|date=14 May 2012|work=Reuters|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> Ultimately, [[Nicos Anastasiades]] of DISY emerged victorious in the presidential election, taking 45.5% of the vote, against 26.9% for the AKEL-backed [[Stavros Malas]] and the EDEK-backed [[Giorgos Lillikas]]. In the second round, Anastasiades captured 57.5% to 42.5% for Malas. The [[Cabinet of Cyprus|Anastasiades administration]] took office on 28 February 2013, comprising DISY, DIKO and the [[European Party (Cyprus)|European Party]] (EVROKO). The Democrats later pulled out of the coalition, however.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://famagusta-gazette.com/diko-decides-to-leave-cyprus-government-coalition-p22474-69.htm|title=DIKO decides to leave Cyprus government coalition|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===2014===\nRoughly a year into the presidency of [[Nicos Anastasiades]], the Cypriot parties faced the electorate in [[2014 European Parliament election in Cyprus|European Parliament elections]]. Ahead of the election, DISY and EVROKO announced that they would participate in the election on a joint ticket; the social democrats in EDEK and the [[Ecological and Environmental Movement]] (KOP) also formed an [[electoral coalition|electoral pact]] for the event. With the economic problems the country faced under [[Demetris Christofias]]' AKEL-led government fresh in the minds of voters, the party plummeted to 27.0% of the vote, a loss of 8.4% points. Meanwhile, the DISY-EVROKO pact garnered 37.8%. This election also served as the first electoral test of the [[Citizens' Alliance (Cyprus)|Citizens' Alliance]] (SYPOL) party of former presidential candidate [[Giorgos Lillikas]], which polled 6.8% but failed to win seats in the [[European Parliament]]. The decline of AKEL and the rise of anti-establishment parties continued into 2015 and 2016.<ref>http://paperroom.ipsa.org/papers/paper_11548.pdf</ref>\n\n===2016===\nMere months before the 2016 legislative election, ex-DISY [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Eleni Theocharous]] launched a splinter party, in opposition to Anastasiades' approach to the [[Cyprus issue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/01/15/theocharous-unveils-solidarity-platform-to-save-republic/|title=Theocharous unveils Solidarity platform to \u2018save Republic\u2019|date=15 January 2016|work=Cyprus Mail|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> She advocated for tighter co-operation with other parties particularly DIKO and EDEK.

Papadopoulos claimed that \"behind closed doors\", AKEL was trying to resurrect the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|2004 Annan plan]] that was turned down by the Greek side in a [[2004 Cypriot Annan Plan referendums|referendum]]. While Neophytou and Papadopoulos criticized AKEL's judgment of the economic situation ahead of the [[2012\u201313 Cypriot financial crisis]], Kyprianou recalled his two rivals' assessments at that time. Back then in October 2008, Neophytou had expected things to go \"very well\", though \"based on overconsumption\", while Papadopoulos had gone even further off the mark stating: \"Yes, our economy will be impacted, but certainly not our financial system, which is one of the most resilient in the world.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Angelos Anastasiou |title=Election campaign heats up on economy issues |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]] |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/05/19/election-campaign-heats-economy-issues/ |date=19 May 2016 |accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Opinion polls==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; line-height:16px; margin-bottom:0\"\n| colspan=13| [[File:Polling for 2016 Cyprus election.png|750px]]\n|- style=\"height:42px; background:#e9e9e9;\"\n!

AKEL was seen as the biggest loser of the election, possible reasons being cited as the party's failure to take up a \"proactive\" role and continued disillusionment with the Christofias administration. In contrast, an AKEL member, [[Irini Charalambidou]], gained the highest number of votes for any candidate, following her stark critique of and fight against failing banks. The results were interpreted as a weakening of the front calling for a federal solution by the Turkish Cypriot press and political analyst Louis Igoumenides. Whilst the pro-solution parties, DISY and AKEL, still received a combined 56% of the votes against 40% obtained by anti-solution parties, in the case of a referendum the \"yes\" vote was expected by Igoumenides to be much lower, partly due to the refusal of fanatic voters of DISY and AKEL to collaborate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cyprus parliamentary vote puts far-right in parliament|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyprus-election-idUSKCN0YD0R4|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=cmail>{{cite web|last1=Hazou|first1=Elias|title=Election outcome doesn\u2019t bode well for settlement, political observer says|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/05/23/election-outcome-doest-bode-well-settlement-political-observer-says/|publisher=Cyprus Mail|accessdate=23 May 2016|date=23 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of economics, the Anastasiades government became dependent on smaller parties in order to pass important reforms.
