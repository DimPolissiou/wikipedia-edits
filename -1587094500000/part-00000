At {{convert|8|to|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, it is Australia's smallest bird. It was originally described by [[John Gould]] in 1838, and four subspecies are recognised. The weebill's plumage is nondescript, with olive-grey upperparts and paler, more yellowish underparts. It grades from more brownish plumage in the southern regions of Australia to more yellow in tropical areas.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe weebill was described by John Gould in 1838 as ''Psilopus brevirostris''.

Thyroxine receptors in the pituitary gland are activated by the surplus hormone, suppressing additional release of TSH in a negative feedback loop.  The result is very high levels of circulating thyroid hormones and a low TSH level.\n\n===Pathophysiology ===\n[[File:Hyperthyroidism (2).jpg|thumb|Histopathological image of diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid gland (clinically presenting as hyperthyroidism)]]\nGraves' disease is an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] disorder, in which the body produces [[antibody|antibodies]] to the receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone. (Antibodies to thyroglobulin and to the [[thyroid hormone]]s T3 and T4 may also be produced.)\n\nThese antibodies cause hyperthyroidism because they bind to the TSHr and [[chronic (medicine)|chronically]] stimulate it. The TSHr is expressed on the [[thyroid follicular cells]] of the thyroid gland (the cells that produce thyroid hormone), and the result of chronic stimulation is an abnormally high production of T3 and T4. This, in turn, causes the clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and the enlargement of the thyroid gland visible as goiter.\n\nThe infiltrative exophthalmos frequently encountered has been explained by postulating that the thyroid gland and the extraocular muscles share a common antigen which is recognized by the antibodies. Antibodies binding to the extraocular muscles would cause swelling behind the eyeball.\n\nThe \"orange peel\" skin has been explained by the infiltration of antibodies under the skin, causing an inflammatory reaction and subsequent fibrous plaques.\n\nThe three types of autoantibodies to the TSH receptor currently recognized are:\n\n*Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins: these antibodies (mainly IgG) act as long-acting thyroid stimulants, activating the cells in a longer and slower way than TSH, leading to an elevated production of thyroid hormone.\n*Thyroid growth immunoglobulins: these antibodies bind directly to the TSH receptor and have been implicated in the growth of thyroid follicles.\n*Thyrotrophin binding-inhibiting immunoglobulins: these antibodies inhibit the normal union of TSH with its receptor. Some  actually act as if TSH itself is binding to its receptor, thus inducing thyroid function. Other types may not stimulate the thyroid gland, but prevent TSI and TSH from binding to and stimulating the receptor.\n\nAnother effect of hyperthyroidism is bone loss from osteoporosis, caused by an increased excretion of calcium and phosphorus in the urine and stool. The effects can be minimized if the hyperthyroidism is treated early. [[Thyrotoxicosis]] can also augment calcium levels in the blood by as much as 25%. This can cause stomach upset, excessive urination, and impaired kidney function.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18637 |title=Thyroid Disease, Osteoporosis and Calcium \u2013 Womens Health and Medical Information on |publisher=Medicinenet.com |date=2006-12-07 |access-date=2013-02-27 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307133403/http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18637 |archive-date=2013-03-07 }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nGraves' disease may present clinically with one or more of these characteristic signs:\n*Rapid heartbeat (80%)\n*Diffuse palpable goiter with audible [[bruit]] (70%)\n*Tremor (40%)\n*[[Exophthalmos]] (protuberance of one or both eyes), periorbital edema (25%)\n*Fatigue (70%), weight loss (60%) with increased appetite in young people and poor appetite in the elderly, and other symptoms of hyperthyroidism/[[thyrotoxicosis]]\n*Heat intolerance (55%)\n*Tremulousness (55%)\n*Palpitations (50%)\n\nTwo signs are truly 'diagnostic' of Graves' disease (''i.e.,'' not seen in other hyperthyroid conditions): exophthalmos and nonpitting edema ([[pretibial myxedema]]). Goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland and is of the diffuse type (''i.e.,'' spread throughout the gland). Diffuse goiter may be seen with other causes of hyperthyroidism, although Graves' disease is the most common cause of diffuse goiter. A large goiter will be visible to the naked eye, but a small one (mild enlargement of the gland) may be detectable only by physical examination. Occasionally, goiter is not clinically detectable, but may be seen only with [[computed tomography]] or [[ultrasound]] examination of the thyroid.\n\nAnother sign of Graves' disease is hyperthyroidism, ''i.e.'', overproduction of the [[thyroid hormone]]s T3 and T4. Normal thyroid levels are also seen, and occasionally also [[hypothyroidism]], which may assist in causing goiter (though it is not the cause of the Graves' disease). Hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease is confirmed, as with any other cause of hyperthyroidism, by measuring elevated blood levels of free (unbound) T3 and T4.\n\nOther useful laboratory measurements in Graves' disease include thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, usually undetectable in Graves' disease due to [[negative feedback]] from the elevated T3 and T4), and protein-bound [[iodine]] (elevated).  [[serology|Serologically]] detected thyroid-stimulating antibodies, radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake, or thyroid ultrasound with Doppler all can independently confirm a diagnosis of Grave's disease.\n\n[[Biopsy]] to obtain histiological testing is not normally required, but may be obtained if thyroidectomy is performed.<!-- see eMedicine/med/topic929 of infobox -->\n\nThe goiter in Graves' disease is often not nodular, but [[thyroid nodule]]s are also common.<ref name=\"pmid_9709909\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carnell NE, Valente WA | title = Thyroid nodules in Graves' disease: classification, characterization, and response to treatment | journal = Thyroid | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = 571\u20136 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9709909 | doi = 10.1089/thy.1998.8.571 }}</ref> Differentiating common forms of hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease, single [[thyroid adenoma]], and [[toxic multinodular goiter]] is important to determine proper treatment.<ref name=\"pmid_9709909\"/> The [[toxic multinodular goitre#Differentiation and terminology among types of goiter|differentiation among these entities has advanced]], as imaging and biochemical tests have improved.

These drugs block the binding of iodine and coupling of iodotyrosines. The most dangerous side effect is [[agranulocytosis]] (1/250, more in PTU). Others include [[neutropenia|granulocytopenia]] (dose-dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and [[aplastic anemia]].

This modality is suitable for most patients, although some prefer to use it mainly for older patients. Indications for radioiodine are failed medical therapy or surgery and where medical or surgical therapy are contraindicated. Hypothyroidism may be a complication of this therapy, but may be treated with thyroid hormones if it appears. The rationale for radioactive iodine is that it accumulates in the thyroid and irradiates the gland with its beta and gamma radiations, about 90% of the total radiation being emitted by the beta (electron) particles. The most common method of iodine-131 treatment is to administer a specified amount in microcuries per gram of thyroid gland based on palpation or radiodiagnostic imaging of the gland over 24 hours.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saha|first=Gopal B. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Fundamentals of Nuclear Pharmacy|edition=5|year=2009|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|isbn=978-0387403601|page=342}}</ref> Patients who receive the therapy must be monitored regularly with thyroid blood tests to ensure they are treated with thyroid hormone before they become symptomatically hypothyroid.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sch\u00e4ffler A | title = Hormone replacement after thyroid and parathyroid surgery | journal = Deutsches Arzteblatt International | volume = 107 | issue = 47 | pages = 827\u201334 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21173898 | pmc = 3003466 | doi = 10.3238/arztebl.2010.0827 }}</ref>\n\nContraindications to RAI are [[pregnancy]] (absolute), ophthalmopathy (relative; it can aggravate thyroid eye disease), or solitary [[thyroid nodule|nodules]].<ref name=\"btf-thyroid.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.btf-thyroid.org/information/leaflets/39-radioactive-iodine-guide |title=Treatment of an Over-active or Enlarged Thyroid Gland with Radioactive Iodine \u2013 British Thyroid Foundation |website=Btf-thyroid.org |access-date=2016-09-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902004052/http://www.btf-thyroid.org/information/leaflets/39-radioactive-iodine-guide |archive-date=2016-09-02 }}</ref>\n\nDisadvantages of this treatment are a high incidence of hypothyroidism (up to 80%) requiring eventual thyroid hormone supplementation in the form of a daily pill(s).

Reportedly, a 1% incidence exists of permanent [[Vocal fold paresis|recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis]] after complete thyroidectomy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Removal of the gland enables complete biopsy to be performed to have definite evidence of cancer anywhere in the thyroid. (Needle biopsies are not so accurate at predicting a benign state of the thyroid).  No further treatment of the thyroid is required, unless cancer is detected.  Radioiodine uptake study may be done after surgery, to ensure  all remaining (potentially cancerous) thyroid cells (''i.e.'', near the nerves to the vocal cords) are destroyed. Besides this, the only remaining treatment will be [[levothyroxine]], or thyroid replacement pills to be taken for the rest of the patient's life.\n\nA 2013 review article concludes that surgery appears to be the most successful in the management of Graves' disease, with total thyroidectomy being the preferred surgical option.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Genovese BM, Noureldine SI, Gleeson EM, Tufano RP, Kandil E | title = What is the best definitive treatment for Graves' disease?

Severe cases threatening vision (corneal exposure or optic nerve compression) are treated with steroids or orbital decompression. In all cases, cessation of smoking is essential. Double vision can be corrected with prism glasses and surgery (the latter only when the process has been stable for a while).\n\nDifficulty closing eyes can be treated with lubricant gel at night, or with tape on the eyes to enable full, deep sleep.\n\nOrbital decompression can be performed to enable bulging eyes to retreat back into the head.  Bone is removed from the skull behind the eyes, and space is made for the muscles and fatty tissue to fall back into the skull.\n\nEyelid surgery can be performed on upper and/or lower eyelids to reverse the effects of Graves' disease on the eyelids. Eyelid muscles can become tight with Graves' disease, making it impossible to close eyes all the way.  Eyelid surgery involves an incision along the natural crease of the eyelid, and a scraping away of the muscle that holds the eyelid open. This makes the muscle weaker, which allows the eyelid to extend over the eyeball more effectively. Eyelid surgery helps reduce or eliminate dry eye symptoms.\n\nFor management of clinically active Graves' disease, orbitopathy (clinical activity score >2) with at least mild to moderate severity, intravenous glucocorticoids are the treatment of choice, usually administered in the form of pulse intravenous methylprednisolone.

If the eyes are proptotic (bulging) enough that the lids do not close completely at night, dryness will occur \u2013 with the risk of a secondary corneal infection, which could lead to blindness.

Thyroxine receptors in the pituitary gland are activated by the surplus hormone, suppressing additional release of TSH in a negative feedback loop.  The result is very high levels of circulating thyroid hormones and a low TSH level.\n\n===Pathophysiology ===\n[[File:Hyperthyroidism (2).jpg|thumb|Histopathological image of diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid gland (clinically presenting as hyperthyroidism)]]\nGraves' disease is an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] disorder, in which the body produces [[antibody|antibodies]] to the receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone. (Antibodies to thyroglobulin and to the [[thyroid hormone]]s T3 and T4 may also be produced.)\n\nThese antibodies cause hyperthyroidism because they bind to the TSHr and [[chronic (medicine)|chronically]] stimulate it. The TSHr is expressed on the [[thyroid follicular cells]] of the thyroid gland (the cells that produce thyroid hormone), and the result of chronic stimulation is an abnormally high production of T3 and T4. This, in turn, causes the clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and the enlargement of the thyroid gland visible as goiter.\n\nThe infiltrative exophthalmos frequently encountered has been explained by postulating that the thyroid gland and the extraocular muscles share a common antigen which is recognized by the antibodies. Antibodies binding to the extraocular muscles would cause swelling behind the eyeball.\n\nThe \"orange peel\" skin has been explained by the infiltration of antibodies under the skin, causing an inflammatory reaction and subsequent fibrous plaques.\n\nThe three types of autoantibodies to the TSH receptor currently recognized are:\n\n*Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins: these antibodies (mainly IgG) act as long-acting thyroid stimulants, activating the cells in a longer and slower way than TSH, leading to an elevated production of thyroid hormone.\n*Thyroid growth immunoglobulins: these antibodies bind directly to the TSH receptor and have been implicated in the growth of thyroid follicles.\n*Thyrotrophin binding-inhibiting immunoglobulins: these antibodies inhibit the normal union of TSH with its receptor. Some  actually act as if TSH itself is binding to its receptor, thus inducing thyroid function. Other types may not stimulate the thyroid gland, but prevent TSI and TSH from binding to and stimulating the receptor.\n\nAnother effect of hyperthyroidism is bone loss from osteoporosis, caused by an increased excretion of calcium and phosphorus in the urine and stool. The effects can be minimized if the hyperthyroidism is treated early. [[Thyrotoxicosis]] can also augment calcium levels in the blood by as much as 25%. This can cause stomach upset, excessive urination, and impaired kidney function.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18637 |title=Thyroid Disease, Osteoporosis and Calcium \u2013 Womens Health and Medical Information on |publisher=Medicinenet.com |date=2006-12-07 |access-date=2013-02-27 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307133403/http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18637 |archive-date=2013-03-07 }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nGraves' disease may present clinically with one or more of these characteristic signs:\n*Rapid heartbeat (80%)\n*Diffuse palpable goiter with audible [[bruit]] (70%)\n*Tremor (40%)\n*[[Exophthalmos]] (protuberance of one or both eyes), periorbital edema (25%)\n*Fatigue (70%), weight loss (60%) with increased appetite in young people and poor appetite in the elderly, and other symptoms of hyperthyroidism/[[thyrotoxicosis]]\n*Heat intolerance (55%)\n*Tremulousness (55%)\n*Palpitations (50%)\n\nTwo signs are truly 'diagnostic' of Graves' disease (''i.e.,'' not seen in other hyperthyroid conditions): exophthalmos and nonpitting edema ([[pretibial myxedema]]). Goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland and is of the diffuse type (''i.e.,'' spread throughout the gland). Diffuse goiter may be seen with other causes of hyperthyroidism, although Graves' disease is the most common cause of diffuse goiter. A large goiter will be visible to the naked eye, but a small one (mild enlargement of the gland) may be detectable only by physical examination. Occasionally, goiter is not clinically detectable, but may be seen only with [[computed tomography]] or [[ultrasound]] examination of the thyroid.\n\nAnother sign of Graves' disease is hyperthyroidism, ''i.e.'', overproduction of the [[thyroid hormone]]s T3 and T4. Normal thyroid levels are also seen, and occasionally also [[hypothyroidism]], which may assist in causing goiter (though it is not the cause of the Graves' disease). Hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease is confirmed, as with any other cause of hyperthyroidism, by measuring elevated blood levels of free (unbound) T3 and T4.\n\nOther useful laboratory measurements in Graves' disease include thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, usually undetectable in Graves' disease due to [[negative feedback]] from the elevated T3 and T4), and protein-bound [[iodine]] (elevated).  [[serology|Serologically]] detected thyroid-stimulating antibodies, radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake, or thyroid ultrasound with Doppler all can independently confirm a diagnosis of Grave's disease.\n\n[[Biopsy]] to obtain histiological testing is not normally required, but may be obtained if thyroidectomy is performed.<!-- see eMedicine/med/topic929 of infobox -->\n\nThe goiter in Graves' disease is often not nodular, but [[thyroid nodule]]s are also common.<ref name=\"pmid_9709909\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carnell NE, Valente WA | title = Thyroid nodules in Graves' disease: classification, characterization, and response to treatment | journal = Thyroid | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = 571\u20136 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9709909 | doi = 10.1089/thy.1998.8.571 }}</ref> Differentiating common forms of hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease, single [[thyroid adenoma]], and [[toxic multinodular goiter]] is important to determine proper treatment.<ref name=\"pmid_9709909\"/> The [[toxic multinodular goitre#Differentiation and terminology among types of goiter|differentiation among these entities has advanced]], as imaging and biochemical tests have improved.

The rationale for radioactive iodine is that it accumulates in the thyroid and irradiates the gland with its beta and gamma radiations, about 90% of the total radiation being emitted by the beta (electron) particles.

The radioiodine treatment acts slowly (over months to years) to destroy the thyroid gland, and Graves' disease-associated hyperthyroidism is not cured in all persons by radioiodine, but has a relapse rate that depends on the dose of radioiodine which is administered.<ref name=\"btf-thyroid.org\"/> In rare cases, [[Radiation-induced thyroiditis|radiation induce thyroiditis]] has been linked to this treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mizokami|first=Tetsuya|last2=Hamada|first2=Katsuhiko|last3=Maruta|first3=Tetsushi|last4=Higashi|first4=Kiichiro|last5=Tajiri|first5=Junichi|date=September 2016|title=Painful Radiation Thyroiditis after 131I Therapy for Graves' Hyperthyroidism: Clinical Features and Ultrasonographic Findings in Five Cases|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5091234/|journal=European Thyroid Journal|volume=5|issue=3|pages=201\u2013206|doi=10.1159/000448398|issn=2235-0640|pmc=5091234|pmid=27843811}}</ref>\n\n===Surgery===\n{{Further|Thyroidectomy|}}\nThis modality is suitable for young and pregnant people. Indications for thyroidectomy can be separated into absolute indications or relative indications. These indications aid in deciding which people would benefit most from surgery.<ref name=\":0\" /> The absolute indications are a large goiter (especially when compressing the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]]), suspicious nodules or suspected [[cancer]] (to pathologically examine the thyroid), and people with ophthalmopathy and additionally if it is the person's preferred method of treatment or if refusing to undergo radioactive iodine treatment. Pregnancy is advised to be delayed for 6 months after radioactive iodine treatment.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBoth bilateral subtotal [[thyroidectomy]] and the Hartley-Dunhill procedure (hemithyroidectomy on one side and partial lobectomy on other side) are possible.\n\nAdvantages are immediate cure and potential removal of [[carcinoma]]. Its risks are injury of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]], [[hypoparathyroidism]] (due to removal of the [[parathyroid gland]]s), [[hematoma]] (which can be life-threatening if it compresses the trachea), relapse following medical treatment, infections (less common), and [[scarring]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in the risk of nerve injury can be due to the increased vascularity of the thyroid parenchyma and the development of links between the thyroid capsule and the surrounding tissues. Reportedly, a 1% incidence exists of permanent [[Vocal fold paresis|recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis]] after complete thyroidectomy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Removal of the gland enables complete biopsy to be performed to have definite evidence of cancer anywhere in the thyroid. (Needle biopsies are not so accurate at predicting a benign state of the thyroid).  No further treatment of the thyroid is required, unless cancer is detected.  Radioiodine uptake study may be done after surgery, to ensure  all remaining (potentially cancerous) thyroid cells (''i.e.'', near the nerves to the vocal cords) are destroyed. Besides this, the only remaining treatment will be [[levothyroxine]], or thyroid replacement pills to be taken for the rest of the patient's life.\n\nA 2013 review article concludes that surgery appears to be the most successful in the management of Graves' disease, with total thyroidectomy being the preferred surgical option.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Genovese BM, Noureldine SI, Gleeson EM, Tufano RP, Kandil E | title = What is the best definitive treatment for Graves' disease?

Severe cases threatening vision (corneal exposure or optic nerve compression) are treated with steroids or orbital decompression. In all cases, cessation of smoking is essential. Double vision can be corrected with prism glasses and surgery (the latter only when the process has been stable for a while).\n\nDifficulty closing eyes can be treated with lubricant gel at night, or with tape on the eyes to enable full, deep sleep.\n\nOrbital decompression can be performed to enable bulging eyes to retreat back into the head.  Bone is removed from the skull behind the eyes, and space is made for the muscles and fatty tissue to fall back into the skull.\n\nEyelid surgery can be performed on upper and/or lower eyelids to reverse the effects of Graves' disease on the eyelids. Eyelid muscles can become tight with Graves' disease, making it impossible to close eyes all the way.  Eyelid surgery involves an incision along the natural crease of the eyelid, and a scraping away of the muscle that holds the eyelid open. This makes the muscle weaker, which allows the eyelid to extend over the eyeball more effectively. Eyelid surgery helps reduce or eliminate dry eye symptoms.\n\nFor management of clinically active Graves' disease, orbitopathy (clinical activity score >2) with at least mild to moderate severity, intravenous glucocorticoids are the treatment of choice, usually administered in the form of pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. Studies have consistently shown that pulse intravenous methylprednisolone is superior to oral glucocorticoids both in terms of efficacy and decreased side effects for managing Graves' orbitopathy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roy A, Dutta D, Ghosh S, Mukhopadhyay P, Mukhopadhyay S, Chowdhury S | title = Efficacy and safety of low dose oral prednisolone as compared to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone in managing moderate severe Graves' orbitopathy: A randomized controlled trial | journal = Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 351\u20138 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25932389 | pmc = 4366772 | doi = 10.4103/2230-8210.152770 }}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\nIf left untreated, more serious [[complications (medical)|complications]] could result, including [[birth defect]]s in pregnancy, increased risk of a [[miscarriage]], bone mineral loss<ref name=Ken2001/> and, in extreme cases, death. Graves' disease is often accompanied by an increase in heart rate, which may lead to further heart complications, including loss of the normal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), which may lead to stroke. If the eyes are proptotic (bulging) enough that the lids do not close completely at night, dryness will occur \u2013 with the risk of a secondary corneal infection, which could lead to blindness. Pressure on the optic nerve behind the globe can lead to visual field defects and vision loss, as well. Prolonged untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to bone loss, which may resolve when treated.<ref name=Ken2001>{{cite book|last1=contributors|first1=ed. Kenneth L. Becker...

Continuing arcs of the show includes Jabowski's horniness over Dusty, Kevin's wish to impress his father, and the Crawfords' wish to get back together.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\">{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=Netflix Orders Cop Animated Comedy Series From 'Brickleberry' Creators; Voice Cast Includes Tom Kenny & Sarah Chalke|url=http://deadline.com/2018/04/paradise-p-d-netflix-cop-animated-comedy-comedy-series-brickleberry-creators-voice-cast-tom-kenny-sarah-chalke-1202358417/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=April 4, 2018|date=April 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[David Herman]] as Kevin Pubesalad Crawford, a newly-hired police officer and the son of Chief Randall Crawford. As the series progresses, it is shown he is a capable and competent officer though he could be better if he had the proper equipment and funding for his work.\n* [[Tom Kenny]] as Chief Randall Crawford, the police chief of Paradise PD and Kevin's father. Once a fine and proud cop, following an incident where his son shot off both of his testicles, making him incredibly bitter over the next thirteen years, which eventually led to his divorce with his wife. He has to put on testosterone patches frequently in order to keep his masculinity in check.\n* [[Sarah Chalke]] as Gina Jabowski, a psychotic and violent police officer who often sexually harasses her obese coworker Dusty Marlow.  She does this because she has a [[Fat fetishism|fat fetish]] from a brain injury.\n* [[Cedric Yarbrough]] as Gerald \"Fitz\" Fitzgerald, a police officer whose [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] sometimes hinders his police work.\n* [[Dana Snyder]] as Dusty Marlow, an obese police officer who is constantly [[sexually harassed]] by Gina. He is very child-like and owns several cats.\n** Snyder also voices Stanley Hopson, an elderly [[bisexual]] police officer who often gets out-of-the-ordinary assignments from Chief Crawford. Even at his advanced age, Hopson is a sexually active deviant, who often recounts his sexual endeavours with other men. He is also senile, which leads to many comical misunderstandings. In the pilot episode, Randall reveals that they cannot retire Stanley because the city lacks the funds to pay his pension.\n* [[Kyle Kinane]] as Bullet, a [[police dog]] who is addicted to the confiscated [[drugs]] that he is tasked with guarding.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Mayor Karen Crawford, the mayor of Paradise, Kevin's mother, and Randall's ex-wife.\n* [[Waco O'Guin]] as Robbie, a blonde redneck who sells argyle meth. Bears a striking resemblance to his ''Brickleberry'' character, Bobby Possumcods.\n* [[Roger Black (actor)|Roger Black]] as Delbert, Robbie's best friend and sidekick who also sells argyle meth. Also bears a striking resemblance to a ''Brickleberry'' character. In this case, it's BoDean (Bobby Possumcods' dim-witted friend). In the season one episode ''Task Force'', Delbert gets attacked by the Kingpin's goons due to a decline in argyle meth sales and [[Amputation|loses his right arm]] in the process; by the end of the first season he gains a robotic prosthetic. In the season two episode ''Who Ate Wally's Waffles'', it is revealed that Delbert birth name was Wally and he was artificially created by [[Imagineering|imagineers]] at [[The Walt Disney Company]] to be their next Disney star; he is stolen by Robbie's family as a kid, renamed Delbert, and [[de facto]] adopted by Robbie's family after Robbie wanted Wally for his birthday.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| allreleased = y\n| released    = y\n| color1      = #95D0EF\n| link1       = #Part 1 (2018)\n| episodes1   = 10\n| start1      = {{Start date|2018|8|31}}\n\n| color2      = #FED403\n| link2       = #Part 2 (2020)\n| episodes2   = 8\n| start2      = {{Start date|2020|3|6}}\n}}\n\n===Part 1 (2018)===\n{{Episode table |background=#95D0EF |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |released=y |country=U.S. |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Welcome to Paradise\n |DirectedBy      = Matt Garofalo\n |WrittenBy       = [[Roger Black (actor)|Roger Black]] & [[Waco O'Guin]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|8|31}}\n |ShortSummary    = Kevin Crawford has always wanted to be a cop, just like his father...until the day Kevin accidentally castrated his father by shooting him in the testicles.

The town is also home to many weird characters, including Crawford's ex-wife Karen, the hillbillies Robby and Delbert, Hobo Cop, Dr. Fudlicker, Preacher Paul, Terry Two-Toes and his mom.

As the series progresses, it is shown he is a capable and competent officer though he could be better if he had the proper equipment and funding for his work.\n* [[Tom Kenny]] as Chief Randall Crawford, the police chief of Paradise PD and Kevin's father. Once a fine and proud cop, following an incident where his son shot off both of his testicles, making him incredibly bitter over the next thirteen years, which eventually led to his divorce with his wife. He has to put on testosterone patches frequently in order to keep his masculinity in check.\n* [[Sarah Chalke]] as Gina Jabowski, a psychotic and violent police officer who often sexually harasses her obese coworker Dusty Marlow.  She does this because she has a [[Fat fetishism|fat fetish]] from a brain injury.\n* [[Cedric Yarbrough]] as Gerald \"Fitz\" Fitzgerald, a police officer whose [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] sometimes hinders his police work.\n* [[Dana Snyder]] as Dusty Marlow, an obese police officer who is constantly [[sexually harassed]] by Gina. He is very child-like and owns several cats.\n** Snyder also voices Stanley Hopson, an elderly [[bisexual]] police officer who often gets out-of-the-ordinary assignments from Chief Crawford. Even at his advanced age, Hopson is a sexually active deviant, who often recounts his sexual endeavours with other men. He is also senile, which leads to many comical misunderstandings. In the pilot episode, Randall reveals that they cannot retire Stanley because the city lacks the funds to pay his pension.\n* [[Kyle Kinane]] as Bullet, a [[police dog]] who is addicted to the confiscated [[drugs]] that he is tasked with guarding.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Mayor Karen Crawford, the mayor of Paradise, Kevin's mother, and Randall's ex-wife.\n* [[Waco O'Guin]] as Robbie, a blonde redneck who sells argyle meth. Bears a striking resemblance to his ''Brickleberry'' character, Bobby Possumcods.\n* [[Roger Black (actor)|Roger Black]] as Delbert, Robbie's best friend and sidekick who also sells argyle meth. Also bears a striking resemblance to a ''Brickleberry'' character. In this case, it's BoDean (Bobby Possumcods' dim-witted friend). In the season one episode ''Task Force'', Delbert gets attacked by the Kingpin's goons due to a decline in argyle meth sales and [[Amputation|loses his right arm]] in the process; by the end of the first season he gains a robotic prosthetic. In the season two episode ''Who Ate Wally's Waffles'', it is revealed that Delbert birth name was Wally and he was artificially created by [[Imagineering|imagineers]] at [[The Walt Disney Company]] to be their next Disney star; he is stolen by Robbie's family as a kid, renamed Delbert, and [[de facto]] adopted by Robbie's family after Robbie wanted Wally for his birthday.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| allreleased = y\n| released    = y\n| color1      = #95D0EF\n| link1       = #Part 1 (2018)\n| episodes1   = 10\n| start1      = {{Start date|2018|8|31}}\n\n| color2      = #FED403\n| link2       = #Part 2 (2020)\n| episodes2   = 8\n| start2      = {{Start date|2020|3|6}}\n}}\n\n===Part 1 (2018)===\n{{Episode table |background=#95D0EF |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |released=y |country=U.S. |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Welcome to Paradise\n |DirectedBy      = Matt Garofalo\n |WrittenBy       = [[Roger Black (actor)|Roger Black]] & [[Waco O'Guin]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|8|31}}\n |ShortSummary    = Kevin Crawford has always wanted to be a cop, just like his father...until the day Kevin accidentally castrated his father by shooting him in the testicles.
