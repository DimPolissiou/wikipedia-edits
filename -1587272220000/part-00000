The film was dubbed in Tamil as ''Unmai'' and in Telugu as ''Delhi Simham''. It was remade in Kannada as ''Naxalite'' in 2000 with [[Devaraj]], [[Vijayalakshmi (Kannada actress)|Vijayalakshmi]], [[Thriller Manju]], [[K.S. Ashwath]], [[Kishori Ballal]], Sarojamma, [[H. G. Dattatreya]]\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with some insight into the Brahmin family of Patteri ([[Thilakan]]), a respected astrologer. He helps a police officer named Pothuval ([[Janardhanan (actor)|Janardhanan]]) to crack an ill-famed temple robbery. The story then moves to a political arena, where the well-liked and righteous Chief Minister, Madhavan ([[Balachandra Menon]]) initiates a crackdown on corrupt Government servants, angering his party and Ministers alike. In the by-election soon to follow, where he has to win to retain his position as the Chief Minister (CM), the party conspires against him for that matter. During a chance encounter with the CM, Patteri senses a bad omen regarding Madhavan's success and hopes maybe the by-elections won't happen. Meanwhile, an enigmatic and alluring woman is shown entering a flat where she meets an accomplice and they go through the details of an assassination which they plan to carry out soon. Right before the Chief Minister's next election meeting, DGP Hariprasad ([[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Murali]]) receives a threat call regarding the assassination attempt, which he shares with DySp John ([[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Saikumar]]) asking him to tighten the security and be with the CM at all times. But the plan is executed and the Chief Minister is killed along with the people on dais with him.\n\nThe initial investigation is headed by the IPS officer Meena Nambiar ([[Vani Viswanath]]). Aided by a misplaced camera from the debris, suspicion is laid on the photograph of a \u2018killer woman\u2019, who sneaked into the venue using a forged journalist pass. They trace the local temporary residence of hers and arrest the home owner ([[Babu Namboothiri]]) and his family on charges of sheltering the culprit, although he was tricked by the woman. The investigation advance no further and this provokes the Judge dealing the case; because for no solid reason, the home owner and his family are being punished, due to the inefficiency of the investigating officer. The sensational nature of the case, achieved partly because of Meena Nambiar's media obsession, causes a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to take over.\n\nThe SIT arrives from Delhi and is headed by Bharath an IPS officer posted in Ministry of Home Affairs([[Mammootty]]), who is Patteri's son. The initial friction between Bharath and Meena, dwindles to a friendship, once Bharath makes the first startling discovery. Bharath is targeted more than once by unknown assassinators, on one occasion even inside the police HQ. While this frightens most, he gets convinced that the enemy is \u201cnear\u201d and influential. In spite of so many complicated deceptive leads, he grows suspicious of the credibility of the photograph of the killer woman. The fact that the residence of the killer yielded no female fingerprints and there is an unidentified male fingerprint in the same apartment reveals to him that the photograph was a decoy. The killer is a male and the police kept chasing someone who isn't there. They learn the whereabouts of him, by strategic publicizing of a generated photograph of the man. They also apprehend the killer's accomplice. But, close to capturing the killer, who goes by the name Bose, they find him killed by the enemy.\n\nThe investigation now almost comes to a standstill, until they learn that there was a similar attempt before, which did not materialize. The killer expected someone else with the CM, who was the Deputy Superintendent of Police (Dy.SP), John. They quickly learn that Dy.SP John was the actual target and the death of the CM was an added advantage. The illusion of a political conspiracy against the CM was the enemy's trump card. In search of a motive behind the assassination, the team finds that John was investigating an accidental explosion in a fireworks factory at the time. John was astonished by the finds of the case, where the explosives dealing license of the owner, Poozhimattom Thomachan ([[N. F. Varghese]]), was being employed for dealing with larger quantities of explosives driving terrorist activities in the State. He was killed for that matter and the CM was chosen for a strong deception. Also the enemy feared the CM, if John's investigation report were to reach his hands.\n\nThomachan is a politician and was a Minister in Madhavan's Ministry, but is too incapable a person, to have masterminded the brilliant scheme. The team's most astounding find then follows, with the discovery of the puppet master and the silent partner in the illegal explosive deals of Thomachan. The Director General of Police (DGP) Hariprasad, who administered the investigation from the beginning, was the actual culprit they were after. He was the one who misled the previous investigation, initiated various attempts to murder Bharath (to scare the team away) and played the faithful ally throughout. The team submit the report and the guilty are put behind bars. The film ends with the team flying back to Delhi, with a promise of promotion to Pothuval, their local help.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Mammootty]] as Bharath Patteri, Director SIT\n*[[Divya Unni]] as Nimmy\n*[[Vani Viswanath]] as SP Meena Nambiar \n*[[Thilakan]] as Sivapuram Patteri \n*[[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Murali]] as DGP Hariprasad \n* [[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Saikumar]] as DYSP John\n* [[Jignesh Joshi ]] as Killer Woman \n* [[Balachandra Menon]] as Chief Minister Madhavan\n* [[K.

It is also thought that the ultimate source of the name China is the Chinese word \"Qin\" ({{zh|c=\u79e6}}), the name of the [[Qin dynasty|dynasty]] that unified China but also existed as a [[Qin (state)|state]] for many centuries prior.

It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in [[Western Zhou]]. It could refer to the states of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the [[Han dynasty]], three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' uses the concept ''zhong'' to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in [[Tianxia]]. Three are in [[Nanman|Man]] and [[Dongyi|Yi]]. Five are in ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1''.\" The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Baiyue|Yue]] to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u83ef}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u534e}}) and ''Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u83ef\u590f}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u590f}}), names for \"China\" that comes from the [[Xia dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|left|\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\" (''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'', ''Zhongguo Guanhua'', {{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71}}), the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] in 1742<ref>{{cite web |last = Fourmont |first = Etienne |title = Linguae Sinarum Mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatica duplex, latin\u00e8, & cum characteribus Sinensium.

The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire]], and [[Wei Yuan]], a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from ''Zhongguo'', which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"[[China proper]]\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country.

The phrase ''Tianchao'' continues to see use on Chinese internet discussion boards, in reference to China.<ref name=tianchao/>\n\nThe phrase ''Tianchao'' was first translated into English and French in the early 19th century, appearing in foreign publicans and diplomatic correspondences,<ref name=mailt>{{cite web|url=https://mailtribune.com/archive/-celestial-origins-come-from-long-ago-in-chinese-history|title='Celestial' origins come from long ago in Chinese history|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=25 November 2019|work=Mail Tribune|publisher=Rosebud Media LLC}}</ref> with the translated phrase \"Celestial Empire\" occasionally used to refer to China. During this period, the term ''celestial'' was used by some to refer to the subjects of the [[Qing dynasty]] in a non-prejudicial manner,<ref name=mailt/> derived from the term \"Celestial Empire\". However, the term ''celestial'' was also used in a pejorative manner during the 19th century, in reference to Chinese immigrants in Australasia and North America.<ref name=mailt/> The translated phrase has largely fallen into disuse in the 20th century.\n\nTranslations for ''Tianxia'' include:\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f (''Podneb\u00e9snaya''; lit. \"under the heaven\")\n\n=== Jiangshan ===\n''Jiangshan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n}}) literally means \"rivers and mountains\". This term is quite similar in usage to ''Tianxia'', and simply refers to the entire world, and here the most prominent features of which being rivers and mountains. The use of this term is also common as part of the phrase ''Jiangshan sheji'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71\u793e\u7a37}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n sh\u00e8j\u00ec}}; lit. \"rivers and mountains, [[soil and grain]]\"), suggesting the need to implement good governance.\n\n=== Jiuzhou ===\n{{Main|Jiuzhou}}\n\nThe name ''Jiuzhou'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=ji\u01d4 zh\u014du}}) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of [[Warring States period]] of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE).  During that time, the [[Yellow River]] river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, [[Yu the Great]], who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult [[Zhou (political division)|Zhou]] for more information.)\n\n=== Shenzhou ===\nThis name means ''Divine Land'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u795e\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du|c=|s=|t=|l=divine/godly provinces}}) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou meaning \"nine provinces\". It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\n=== Sihai ===\n{{Main|Four Seas}}\n\nThis name, ''[[Four Seas]]'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u56db\u6d77}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=s\u00ech\u01cei|links=no}}), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world. It came from the ancient notion that the world is flat and surrounded by sea.\n\n=== Han ===\n{{Chinese\n|title = Han\n|t = {{linktext|\u6f22}}\n|s = {{linktext|\u6c49}}\n|p = H\u00e0n\n|gr = Hann\n|w = Han\u2074\n|mi={{IPAc-cmn|h|an|4|}}\n|bpmf=\u310f\u3122\u02cb\n|j=Hon3\n|y=Hon\n|ci={{IPAc-yue|h|on|3|}}\n|gan=Hon<sup>5</sup>\n|h=Hon<sup>55</sup>\n|poj=H\u00e0n\n|tl=H\u00e0n\n|teo=Hang<sup>3</sup>\n|mc=xan<sup>C</sup>\n|buc = H\u00e1ng\n|wuu = Hoe<sup>\u53bb</sup>\n|kana = \u304b\u3093\n|kanji = {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}\n|romaji = kan\n|hangul = \ud55c\n|hanja = {{lang|ko|\u6f22}}\n|rr = han\n|qn = h\u00e1n\n|showflag = p\n}}\n\nThe name ''Han'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6f22}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u6c49}}; {{zh|p=H\u00e0n}}) derives from the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC\u2013220 AD), who presided over China's first \"golden age\". The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] periods. During these periods, various non-Chinese ethnic groups invaded from the north and conquered areas of North China, which they held for several centuries. It was during this period that people began to use the term \"Han\" to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the invaders) were the descendants of the subjects of the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]] Mongolian rulers divided people into four classes: Mongols, [[Semu]] or \"Colour-eyeds\", Hans, and \"Southerns\". Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class \"Han\" includes all ethnic groups in northern China including [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] who have in most part sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name \"Han\" became popularly accepted.\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the local Chinese from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today the term \"Han Persons\", often rendered in English as [[Han Chinese]], is used by the People's Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 [[List of Chinese nationalities|officially recognized ethnic groups]] of China. The \"Han Chinese\" are simply referred to as \"Chinese\" by some.\n\n=== Tang ===\n{{Chinese\n|title = Tang\n|c = {{linktext|\u5510}}\n|p = T\u00e1ng\n|mi = {{IPAc-cmn|t|ang|2}}\n|gr = Tarng\n|w = T\u02bbang\u00b2\n|bpmf = \u310a\u3124\u02ca\n|gan = Tong\n|poj = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|tl = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|wuu = Daon<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n|j = Tong4\n|ci = {{IPAc-yue|t|ong|4}}\n|y = T\u00f2hng\n|h = Tong<sup>11</sup>\n|kana = \u3068\u3046 <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, \u304b\u3089 <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|romaji = t\u014d <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, kara <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|kanji = {{lang|ja|\u5510}}\n|hangul = \ub2f9\n|hanja = {{lang|ko|\u5510}}\n|rr = dang\n|qn = \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\n|showflag = p\n}}\n\nThe name ''Tang'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ng}}) comes from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age. It was during the Tang Dynasty that South China was finally and fully [[Sinicized]]; Tang would become synonymous with China in Southern China and it is usually Southern Chinese who refer to themselves as \"''People of Tang''\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5510\u4eba}}}}, {{zh|p=T\u00e1ngr\u00e9n}}).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbDdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=China: A Cultural and Historical Dictionary |first= Michael|last= Dillon |date=13 September 2013 |page=132 |isbn=9781136791413 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref> For example, the sinicization and rapid development of [[Guangdong]] during the Tang period would lead the Cantonese to refer to themselves as ''Tong-yan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510\u4eba}}}}) in Cantonese, while China is called ''Tong-saan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510\u5c71}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ngsh\u0101n|l=Tang Mountain|links=no}}).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZjruI0_XmcC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions|author= H.

The Cantonese term ''Tongsan'' (Tang mountain) is recorded in [[Malay language|Old Malay]] as one of the local terms for China, along with the Sanskrit-derived ''Cina''. It is still used in [[Malaysia]] today, usually in a derogatory sense.\n\nAmong Taiwanese, ''Tang mountain'' (Min-Nan: Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f) has been used, for example, in the saying, \"has Tangshan father, no Tangshan mother\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u6709\u5510\u5c71\u516c\uff0c\u7121\u5510\u5c71\u5abd}}; {{zh|poj=\u016a Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f kong, b\u00f4 Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f m\u00e1}}).<ref>{{cite book |last=Tai |first=Pao-tsun |title = The Concise History of Taiwan |edition = Chinese-English bilingual |year = 2007 |publisher = Taiwan Historica |location = Nantou City |isbn = 9789860109504 |page = 52 }}</ref><ref><span lang=\"zh-Hant\">{{holodict|60161|e=\u6709\u5510\u5c71\u516c\uff0c\u7121\u5510\u5c71\u5abd\u3002}}</span></ref> This refers how the Han people crossing the [[Taiwan Strait]] in the 17th and 18th centuries were mostly men, and that many of their offspring would be through intermarriage with [[Taiwanese aborigine]] women.\n\nIn [[Okinawan language|Ryukyuan]], [[Karate]] was originally called ''tii'' ({{lang|xug|\u624b}}, hand) or ''karatii'' ({{lang|xug|\u5510\u624b}}, Tang hand) because {{lang|xug|\u5510\u306c\u570b}} ''too-nu-kuku'' or ''kara-nu-kuku'' ({{lang|xug|\u5510\u306c\u570b}}) was a common [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan]] name for China; it was changed to ''karate'' ({{lang|xug|\u7a7a\u624b}}, open hand) to appeal to Japanese people after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].\n\n=== Dalu and Neidi ===\n''D\u00e0l\u00f9'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5927\u9678}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u5927\u9646}}; {{zh|p=d\u00e0l\u00f9}}), literally \"big continent\" or \"mainland\" in this context, is used as a short form of ''Zh\u014dngg\u00fao D\u00e0l\u00f9'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5927\u9678}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646}}, Mainland China), excluding (depending on the context) Hong Kong and [[Macau]], and/or [[Taiwan]]. This term is used in official context in both the mainland and Taiwan, when referring to the mainland as opposed to Taiwan. In certain contexts, it is equivalent to the term ''Neidi'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5185\u5730}}; {{zh|p=n\u00e8id\u00ec}}, literally \"the inner land\"). While ''Neidi'' generally refers to the interior as opposed to a particular coastal or border location, or the coastal or border regions generally, it is used in Hong Kong specifically to mean mainland China excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.\n\nThe term ''Neidi'' is also often used in Xinjiang and Tibet to distinguish the eastern provinces of China from the minority-populated, autonomous regions of the

An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as [[Korea]], and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a [[metonymy|metonymic]] extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]].\n\nThe Japanese word ''[[karate]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7a7a\u624b}}, lit. \"empty hand\") is derived from the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word ''karatii'' ({{lang|ja|\u5510\u624b}}, lit. \"Tang/Chinese hand\") and refers to Okinawan [[martial arts]]; the character for ''kara'' was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.\n\n=== Morokoshi ===\nJapanese: ''Morokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u5510\u571f}}). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading of the Chinese compound {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8af8\u8d8a}} ''Zh\u016byu\u00e8'' or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u767e\u8d8a}}\n[[Baiyue|B\u01ceiyu\u00e8]] as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\nThe Japanese common noun ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30a6\u30e2\u30ed\u30b3\u30b7, \u7389\u8700\u9ecd}}), which refers to [[maize]], appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean \"jade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] [[proso millet|millet]],\" the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to \"[[names of China#Tang|Tang]] morokoshi,\" in which \"morokoshi\" was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for [[sorghum]], which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.\n\n===Mangi===\n[[File:1837 Malte-Brun Map of the Mongol Empire in Asia and Europe - Geographicus - AsiaMongol-mb-1837.jpg|thumb|1837 map of Mongol Empire, showing '''Mangi''' in south China]]\nFrom Chinese ''Manzi'' (southern barbarians). The division of [[North China and South China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han Chinese to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called [[#Cathay|Cathay]], Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] as a disparaging term for Southern China. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese ''Nangkiyas'' or ''Nangkiyad'', and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word ''Manzi'' reached the Western world as ''Mangi'' (as used by Marco Polo), which is a name commonly found on medieval maps. Note however that the Chinese themselves considered ''Manzi'' to be  derogatory and never used it as a self-appellation.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dynastic China: An Elementary History|author= Tan Koon San |date=15 August 2014|page=247 |publisher=The Other Press|isbn=9789839541885 }}</ref> Some early scholars believed ''Mangi'' to be a corruption of the Persian ''Machin'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u0627\u0686\u064a\u0646}}) and Arabic ''M\u0101\u1e63\u012bn'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0646}}), which may be a mistake as these two forms are derived from the Sanskrit ''Maha Chin'' meaning Great China.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=165}}</ref>\n\n*Chinese: ''Manzi'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u86ee\u5b50|\u883b\u5b50]]}})\n*[[Latin]]: ''Mangi''\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Politics|Language}}\n* [[Chinese romanization]]\n* [[List of country name etymologies]]\n* [[Names of the Qing dynasty]]\n* [[Names of India]]\n* [[Names of Japan]]\n* [[Names of Korea]]\n* [[Names of Vietnam]]\n* [[\u00cele-de-France]], similar French concept\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n; Books\n* {{cite book |title = Grounds of Judgment: Extraterritoriality and Imperial Power in Nineteenth-Century China and Japan |first = Par Kristoffer |last=Cassel |volume= |edition= |year = 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qlJpAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-0199792122 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Chinas religionen ...|first=Rudolf |last=Dvo\u0159\u00e1k |volume = Volume 12; Volume 15 of Darstellungen aus dem Gebiete der nichtchristlichen Religionsgeschichte |edition=illustrated |year=1895 |publisher = Aschendorff (Druck und Verlag der Aschendorffschen Buchhandlung) |url = https://books.google.com/?id=TmhtAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 0199792054 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |title = New Qing Imperial History: The Making of Inner Asian Empire at Qing Chengde |first1=Ruth W. |last1=Dunnell |first2=Mark C. |last2=Elliott |first3=Philippe |last3=Foret |first4=James A |last4=Millward |volume=|edition=|year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |url = https://books.google.com/?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 1134362226 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |title = The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|first=Mark C. |last=Elliott |volume=|edition=illustrated, reprint|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 0804746842 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Mandschusprache |first = Erich |last= Hauer |editor-first = Oliver |editor-last = Corff |volume = Volume 12; Volume 15 of Darstellungen aus dem Gebiete der nichtchristlichen Religionsgeschichte |edition = illustrated |year = 2007 |publisher = Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |url = https://books.google.com/?id=NESwGW_5uLoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-3447055284 |accessdate = 10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n* {{cite book |first = Joseph |last= Esherick |chapter=How the Qing Became China |title =Empire to Nation: Historical Perspectives on the Making of the Modern World |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2006 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title = China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia |first=Peter C. |last=Perdue |volume= |edition=reprint |year=2009 |publisher = Harvard University Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |isbn = 978-0674042025 |accessdate = 10 March 2014 |ref = {{harvid||}} }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Wade |first=Geoff |url = http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp188_yelang_china.pdf |title = The Polity of Yelang and the Origin of the Name 'China' |journal = Sino-Platonic Papers |volume = 188 |date = May 2009 |accessdate= 4 October 2011 |ref=harv}} \n*{{citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Endymion|year=2012 |title=Chinese History: A New Manual |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center for the Harvard-Yenching Institute }}\n* {{cite book |last = Wilkinson |first = Endymion |year = 2015 |title = Chinese History: A New Manual, 4th edition |publisher = Harvard University Asia Center distributed by Harvard University Press |location = Cambridge, MA |isbn = 9780674088467 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |language = de |title = Die Eroberung von Qinghai unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung von Tibet und Khams 1717 -

It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in [[Western Zhou]]. It could refer to the states of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the [[Han dynasty]], three usages of \"Zhongguo\" were common. The ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' explicitly defines \"Zhongguo\" as the capital; the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' uses the concept ''zhong'' to indicate the center of civilization: \"Eight famous mountains are there in [[Tianxia]]. Three are in [[Nanman|Man]] and [[Dongyi|Yi]]. Five are in ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1''.\" The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' uses the concept of the central states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\", or the states in \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: \"If we can lead the host of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Baiyue|Yue]] to oppose \"Zhongguo,\" then let us break off relations with them soon.\" In this sense, the term \"Zhongguo\" is synonymous with ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u83ef}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u4e2d\u534e}}) and ''Hu\u00e1xi\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u83ef\u590f}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u590f}}), names for \"China\" that comes from the [[Xia dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|left|\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\" (''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'', ''Zhongguo Guanhua'', {{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71}}), the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] in 1742<ref>{{cite web |last = Fourmont |first = Etienne |title = Linguae Sinarum Mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatica duplex, latin\u00e8, & cum characteribus Sinensium.

The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire]], and [[Wei Yuan]], a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from ''Zhongguo'', which he defined as the 17 provinces of \"[[China proper]]\" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as ''Zhongguo'' (see the discussion below).<ref>{{harvp|Esherick|2006|pp=232\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n''Dulimbai Gurun'' is the Manchu name for China.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NESwGW_5uLoC&pg=PA117&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iT7tUsrhM4bhyQH_04HYBg&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Hauer 2007], p. 117.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmhtAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA80&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-0PtUoKZEKWgyAH8oIHgBQ&ved=0CF0Q6AEwCTge#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Dvo\u0159\u00e1k 1895], p. 80.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqVug_wN4hEC&pg=PA102&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m0PtUtv-OIOTyQHX8YCwAQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=Dulimbai%20gurun&f=false Wu 1995], p. 102.</ref> The historian Zhao Gang writes that \"not long after the collapse of the Ming, China [Zhongguo] became the equivalent of Great Qing (Da Qing)\u2014another official title of the Qing state\", and  \"Qing and China became interchangeable official titles, and the latter often appeared as a substitute for the former in official documents.\"{{sfnb|Zhao|2006| p = 7}}  The Qing dynasty referred to their realm as \"''Dulimbai Gurun''\" in Manchu.

This term is quite similar in usage to ''Tianxia'', and simply refers to the entire world, and here the most prominent features of which being rivers and mountains. The use of this term is also common as part of the phrase ''Jiangshan sheji'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6c5f\u5c71\u793e\u7a37}}; {{zh|p=Ji\u0101ngsh\u0101n sh\u00e8j\u00ec}}; lit. \"rivers and mountains, [[soil and grain]]\"), suggesting the need to implement good governance.\n\n=== Jiuzhou ===\n{{Main|Jiuzhou}}\n\nThe name ''Jiuzhou'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=ji\u01d4 zh\u014du}}) means \"nine provinces\". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of [[Warring States period]] of China (c. 400\u2013221 BCE).  During that time, the [[Yellow River]] river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, [[Yu the Great]], who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult [[Zhou (political division)|Zhou]] for more information.)\n\n=== Shenzhou ===\nThis name means ''Divine Land'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u795e\u5dde}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=Sh\u00e9nzh\u014du|c=|s=|t=|l=divine/godly provinces}}) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou meaning \"nine provinces\". It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.\n\n=== Sihai ===\n{{Main|Four Seas}}\n\nThis name, ''[[Four Seas]]'' ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u56db\u6d77}}|labels=no}}; {{zh|p=s\u00ech\u01cei|links=no}}), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world.

The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] periods. During these periods, various non-Chinese ethnic groups invaded from the north and conquered areas of North China, which they held for several centuries. It was during this period that people began to use the term \"Han\" to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the invaders) were the descendants of the subjects of the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]] Mongolian rulers divided people into four classes: Mongols, [[Semu]] or \"Colour-eyeds\", Hans, and \"Southerns\". Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class \"Han\" includes all ethnic groups in northern China including [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] who have in most part sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name \"Han\" became popularly accepted.\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the local Chinese from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today the term \"Han Persons\", often rendered in English as [[Han Chinese]], is used by the People's Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 [[List of Chinese nationalities|officially recognized ethnic groups]] of China. The \"Han Chinese\" are simply referred to as \"Chinese\" by some.\n\n=== Tang ===\n{{Chinese\n|title = Tang\n|c = {{linktext|\u5510}}\n|p = T\u00e1ng\n|mi = {{IPAc-cmn|t|ang|2}}\n|gr = Tarng\n|w = T\u02bbang\u00b2\n|bpmf = \u310a\u3124\u02ca\n|gan = Tong\n|poj = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|tl = T\u00f4ng/Tn\u0302g\n|wuu = Daon<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n|j = Tong4\n|ci = {{IPAc-yue|t|ong|4}}\n|y = T\u00f2hng\n|h = Tong<sup>11</sup>\n|kana = \u3068\u3046 <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, \u304b\u3089 <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|romaji = t\u014d <small>([[On'yomi|On]])</small>, kara <small>([[Kun'yomi|Kun]])</small>\n|kanji = {{lang|ja|\u5510}}\n|hangul = \ub2f9\n|hanja = {{lang|ko|\u5510}}\n|rr = dang\n|qn = \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\n|showflag = p\n}}\n\nThe name ''Tang'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}; {{zh|p=T\u00e1ng}}) comes from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) that presided over China's second golden age.

Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.\n\nThe term ''Neidi'' is also often used in Xinjiang and Tibet to distinguish the eastern provinces of China from the minority-populated, autonomous regions of the west.\n\n== Official names ==\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|title=People's Republic of China\n|pic=PRC (Chinese characters.svg\n|piccap=\"People's Republic of China\" in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] (top) and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional]] (bottom) Chinese characters\n|picupright=1.15\n|t={{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u570b}}\n|s={{linktext|\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd}}\n|p=Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|gr=Jonghwa Renmin Gonqhergwo\n|mps=J\u016bnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f9ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|w=Chung\u00b9-hua\u00b2 J\u00ean\u00b2-min\u00b2<br />Kung\u2074-ho\u00b2-kuo\u00b2\n|tp=Jhonghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3\n|myr=J\u016bnghw\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f9ngh\u00e9gw\u00f3\n|mi={{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|h|wa|2|-|r|en|2|.|m|in|2|-|g|ong|4|.|h|e|2|.|g|wo|2}}\n|sic=Zong<sup>1</sup> hua<sup>2</sup> Zen<sup>2</sup> min<sup>2</sup><br />Gong<sup>4</sup> hwe<sup>2</sup> gwe<sup>2</sup>\n|bpmf=\u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u3128\u311a\u02ca<br />\u3116\u3123\u02ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u3107\u3127\u3123\u02ca<br />\u310d\u3128\u3125\u02cb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u311c\u02ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310d\u3128\u311b\u02ca\n|xej=\ufe9f\u0652\ufeee\ufea7\u064f\ufeee\u064e \u0698\u064c\u0645\u064d \ufed7\u0652\ufeee\u062d\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0648\u064e\u0639\n|zh-dungan=\u0496\u0443\u043d\u0445\u0443\u0430 \u0416\u044b\u043d\u043c\u0438\u043d \u0413\u0443\u043d\u0445\u04d9\u0433\u0443\u0439\n|poj=Tiong-h\u00f4a J\u00een-b\u00een Ki\u014dng-h\u00f4-kok\n|tl=Tiong-hu\u00e2 J\u00een-b\u00een Ki\u014dng-h\u00f4-kok\n|gan=Chungfa Ninmin Khungfokoet\n|wuu=tson<sup>\u5e73</sup> gho<sup>\u5e73</sup> zin<sup>\u5e73</sup> min<sup>\u5e73</sup><br />gon<sup>\u53bb</sup> ghu<sup>\u5e73</sup> koh<sup>\u5165</sup>\n|j=Zung1waa4 Jan4man4 Gung6wo4gwok3\n|ci={{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|w|aa|4|-|j|an|4|.|m|an|4|-|g|ung|6|.|w|o|4|.|gw|ok|3}}<br />''or''<br />{{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|w|aa|4|-|j|an|4|.|m|an|4|-|g|ung|6|.|w|o|4|.|gw|ok|3}}\n|y=J\u00f9ng'w\u00e0h Y\u00e0hnm\u00e0hn Guhng'w\u00f2hgwok<br />''or''<br />J\u016bng'w\u00e0h Y\u00e0hnm\u00e0hn Guhng'w\u00f2hgwok\n|hsn=/tan<sup>33</sup> go<sup>13</sup> \u014bin<sup>13</sup> min<sup>13</sup><br />gan<sup>45</sup> gu<sup>13</sup> kw\u025b<sup>24</sup>/\n|h=dung<sup>24</sup> fa<sup>11</sup> ngin<sup>11</sup> min<sup>11</sup><br />kiung<sup>55</sup> fo<sup>11</sup> gued<sup>2</sup>\n|phfs=Ch\u00fbng-f\u00e0 Ng\u00ecn-m\u00ecn<br />Khiung-f\u00f2-koet\n|buc=D\u1e73\u0306ng-hu\u00e0 \u00ccng-m\u00ecng<br />G\u00ea\u0324\u1e73ng-hu\u00f2-gu\u00f3k\n|hhbuc=De\u0324ng-hu\u00e1 C\u00edng-m\u00edng<br />G\u0113\u0324ng-h\u00f3\u0324-go\u0324h\n|mblmc=D\u00f4\u0324ng-u\u01ce N\u00eang-m\u011bng<br />G\u014d\u0324ng-u\u01ce-g\u014f\n|mong=[[File:Mongolian-PRC2.svg|70px|alt=B\u00fcg\u00fcde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus, \u182a\u1826\u182d\u1826\u1833\u1821 \u1828\u1820\u1836\u1822\u1837\u1820\u182e\u1833\u1820\u182c\u1824 \u1833\u1824\u182e\u1833\u1820\u1833\u1824 \u1820\u1837\u1820\u1833 \u1824\u182f\u1824\u1830]]\n|monr=B\u00fcg\u00fcde nayiramdaqu dumdadu arad ulus\n|tib={{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f67\u0fad\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f58\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fa4\u0fb1\u0f72<br />\u0f58\u0f50\u0f74\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f56}}\n|wylie=krung hwa mi dmangs spyi mthun rgyal khab\n|zwpy=Zhunghua Mimang Jitun Gyalkab\n|uig=\u062c\u06c7\u06ad\u062e\u06c7\u0627 \u062e\u06d5\u0644\u0642 \u062c\u06c7\u0645\u06be\u06c7\u0631\u0649\u064a\u0649\u062a\u0649\n|uly=Jungxua Xelq Jumhuriyiti\n|uyy=Junghua H\u0259l\u2c6a Jum\u2c68uriyiti\n|sgs=Junghua H\u00e4lk\u0302 Jum\u0125uriyiti\n|usy=\u0496\u0443\u04a3\u0445\u0443\u0430 \u0425\u04d9\u043b\u049b \u0496\u0443\u043c\u04bb\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0438\u0442\u0438\n|zha=Cunghvaz Yinzminz Gunghozgoz\n|mnc=\u1869\u1860\u182f\u1873\u182e\u182a\u1820\u1873<br />\u1828\u1873\u1836\u1820\u182f\u182e\u1820\u1873\u1875\u1864\u185d\u1828<br />\u1864\u1860\u1828\u1865\u185d \u1864\u1860\u1875\u1860\u1828\n|mnc_rom=Dulimbai niyalmairgen gunghe' gurun\n|showflag=p\n|order = st\n}}\n\nThe name '''New China''' has been frequently applied to China by the [[Communist Party of China]] as a positive political and social term contrasting pre-1949 China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state, which eventually became '''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3''' (see below), known in English as the \"People's Republic of China\". This term is also sometimes used by writers outside mainland China. The PRC was known to many in the West during the [[Cold War]] as \"'''Communist China'''\" or \"Red China\" to distinguish it from the [[Republic of China]] which is commonly called \"Taiwan\", \"Nationalist China\" or \"Free China\". In some contexts, particularly in economics, trade, and sports, \"China\" is often used to refer to [[mainland China]] to the exclusion of Hong Kong, [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nThe official name of

''Chinese History: A Manual.'' p. 32.</ref> With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of [[Taiwan]] and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply \"'''[[Taiwan]]'''\", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See [[Taiwan Independence]].) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the [[Cold War]], the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as \"Free China\" or \"Liberal China\", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the \"Bandit-occupied Area\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u532a\u5340}}) by the ROC).

Martin, ''Dagur Mongolian Grammar, Texts, and Lexicon'', Indiana University Publications Uralic and Altaic Series, Vol. 4, 1961</ref> As in the case of the Manchu language, the Daur word ''Niaken'' is essentially an ethnonym, and the proper way to refer to the country of the Han Chinese (i.e., \"China\" in a cultural sense) is ''Niaken gurun'', while ''niakendaaci-'' is a verb meaning \"to talk in Chinese.\"\n\n===Kara===\nJapanese: ''Kara'' ({{lang|ja|\u304b\u3089}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u6f22}}). An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as [[Korea]], and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word \"Kara\" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a [[metonymy|metonymic]] extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]].\n\nThe Japanese word ''[[karate]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7a7a\u624b}}, lit. \"empty hand\") is derived from the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word ''karatii'' ({{lang|ja|\u5510\u624b}}, lit. \"Tang/Chinese hand\") and refers to Okinawan [[martial arts]]; the character for ''kara'' was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.\n\n=== Morokoshi ===\nJapanese: ''Morokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u3082\u308d\u3053\u3057}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|\u5510}} or {{lang|ja|\u5510\u571f}}). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading of the Chinese compound {{lang|zh-Hant|\u8af8\u8d8a}} ''Zh\u016byu\u00e8'' or {{lang|zh-Hant|\u767e\u8d8a}}\n[[Baiyue|B\u01ceiyu\u00e8]] as \"all the Yue\" or \"the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,\" which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.\n\nThe Japanese common noun ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30a6\u30e2\u30ed\u30b3\u30b7, \u7389\u8700\u9ecd}}), which refers to [[maize]], appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although ''t\u014dmorokoshi'' is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean \"jade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] [[proso millet|millet]],\" the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to \"[[names of China#Tang|Tang]] morokoshi,\" in which \"morokoshi\" was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for [[sorghum]], which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.\n\n===Mangi===\n[[File:1837 Malte-Brun Map of the Mongol Empire in Asia and Europe - Geographicus - AsiaMongol-mb-1837.jpg|thumb|1837 map of Mongol Empire, showing '''Mangi''' in south China]]\nFrom Chinese ''Manzi'' (southern barbarians). The division of [[North China and South China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han Chinese to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called [[#Cathay|Cathay]], Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] as a disparaging term for Southern China. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese ''Nangkiyas'' or ''Nangkiyad'', and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word ''Manzi'' reached the Western world as ''Mangi'' (as used by Marco Polo), which is a name commonly found on medieval maps. Note however that the Chinese themselves considered ''Manzi'' to be  derogatory and never used it as a self-appellation.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dynastic China: An Elementary History|author= Tan Koon San |date=15 August 2014|page=247 |publisher=The Other Press|isbn=9789839541885 }}</ref> Some early scholars believed ''Mangi'' to be a corruption of the Persian ''Machin'' ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u0627\u0686\u064a\u0646}}) and Arabic ''M\u0101\u1e63\u012bn'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0646}}), which may be a mistake as these two forms are derived from the Sanskrit ''Maha Chin'' meaning Great China.<ref>{{harvp|Yule|2005|p=165}}</ref>\n\n*Chinese: ''Manzi'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u86ee\u5b50|\u883b\u5b50]]}})\n*[[Latin]]: ''Mangi''\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Politics|Language}}\n* [[Chinese romanization]]\n* [[List of country name etymologies]]\n* [[Names of the Qing dynasty]]\n* [[Names of India]]\n* [[Names of Japan]]\n* [[Names of Korea]]\n* [[Names of Vietnam]]\n* [[\u00cele-de-France]], similar French concept\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n;

As Duffy's first international release, the song is credited with firmly establishing her career and is now considered her signature song. \"Mercy\" received comparisons to Duffy's previous single, \"[[Rockferry (song)|Rockferry]]\".

As Duffy's first international release, the song is credited with firmly establishing her career and is now considered her signature song. \"Mercy\" received comparisons to Duffy's previous single, \"[[Rockferry (song)|Rockferry]]\". Critical reviewers of \"Mercy\" noted similarities between the song to releases by [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Dusty Springfield]] and [[The Supremes]], as well as contemporaries such as fellow British singer [[Amy Winehouse]].\n\n\"Mercy\" was nominated for several awards in 2008, including the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[51st Grammy Awards]].<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite web|url=http://content.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx |title=The 51st Annual Grammy Awards Winners List |publisher=The Recording Academy |accessdate=17 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205000233/http://content.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx |archivedate=5 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=\"grammy2\">{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/12/03/lil-wayne-coldplay-lead-nominations-for-51st-annual-grammy-awards/| title=Lil Wayne, Coldplay Lead Nominations for 51st Annual Grammy Awards | work=[[Rolling Stone]]| publisher=RealNetworks, Inc| accessdate=17 July 2009 | date=3 December 2008}}</ref> Well received by the public, \"Mercy\" peaked at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in February 2008, remaining atop the chart for five weeks, and went on to become the third-best-selling single of 2008 in the United Kingdom, with sales of over 500,000 copies in the UK that year.<ref name=\"endcharts\">{{cite web| url=http://www.ukchartsplus.co.uk/ChartsPlusYE2008.pdf| title=UK Year End Chart 2008| work=[[ChartsPlus]] | publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]] / [[British Phonographic Industry]]| accessdate=17 July 2009 | format= PDF}}</ref> It achieved worldwide chart success, topping the charts in Austria, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Republic of Ireland, Switzerland and Turkey, and peaked within the top five of the charts in Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Romania, Spain and Sweden.

The ''Glee'' version charted on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and in Ireland, and Duffy herself performed the song for the ''Live Lounge''.
