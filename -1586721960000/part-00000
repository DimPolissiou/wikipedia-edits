Educated at [[Downlands College]], in [[Toowoomba]] in southeastern [[Queensland]], he attended the [[University of Queensland]], whom he represented in club cricket. In 1955 for Downlands College against Gregory Terrace at the Brisbane Oval, he scored a 155. He was made the captain of the Queensland Colts and scored 126 against the New South Wales Colts in 1958/59, their first win in the interstate Gregory Cup in eight years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} \n\nHe made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut in 1958\u201359 against the touring [[English cricket team]] and made his [[Sheffield Shield]] debut that season also. He did not command a regular spot in the Sheffield Shield team until the following season. He was selected for his first [[Australian cricket team|Australian squad]] in 1962, playing in an [[MCC tour of Australia in 1962-63#Australian XI vs MCC|Australian XI against the visiting English team]], in which he was hit for two sixes by [[Ted Dexter]] in his opening over.

He was omitted for the third and fourth Tests, but managed to defy the South Africans with stubborn batting in the fifth Test in [[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]], salvaging a draw. He toured [[England]] in 1964, playing all Tests and scoring two half centuries and three three-wicket hauls. He followed this with two more half centuries and a career best of 4/68 on the tour to [[India]]. While scoring 74 in Chennai he hit [[Bapu Nadkarni]], often considered an unhittable bowler, for three sixes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nHe scored his Test best of 88 against Pakistan in Australia the following season but was unavailable to tour the [[West Indies]] in 1965 due to personal reasons. He had a difficult [[1965-66 Ashes series]] back home against England, taking just four wickets and one half-century. He went on the 1966-67 tour of [[South Africa]], which was his last international representation for Australia. He retired from first-class cricket the following year.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nHis bowling was economical but not penetrative, with a Test average of over 40.

One or the other needs attribution. --->\n[[Image:Continuous_form_paper_(14p875_x_11).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Continuous form paper sheet]]\n'''Continuous stationery''' (UK) or '''continuous form paper''' (US) is [[paper]] which is designed for use with [[Dot matrix printing|dot-matrix]] and [[line printer]]s with appropriate paper-feed mechanisms. Other names include ''fan-fold paper'', ''sprocket-feed paper'', ''burst paper'', ''lineflow'' (New Zealand), ''tractor-feed paper'', and ''pin-feed paper''. It can be single-ply (usually [[woodfree uncoated paper]]) or multi-ply (either with [[carbon paper]] between the paper layers, or multiple layers of [[carbonless copy paper]]), often described as [[multipart stationery]] or forms. Continuous stationery is often used when the final print medium is less critical in terms of the appearance at the edges, and when continuously connected individual sheets are not inconvenient for the application. Individual sheets can be separated at the perforation (leaving a slight serration), and sheets also have edges with punched holes, which also can be removed at the perforation (one typical format).\n\n== Shape and form ==\nMost continuous form [[paper]] is punched longitudinally along both edges with regularly spaced engagement holes that engage with [[sprocket]] wheels or toothed belts on the \"tractor\" which move the paper through the printer. It  is usually [[Perforation|perforated]] transversely with a line of closely spaced holes or slits which form a tear edge that allows it to be torn neatly into separate pages after printing; when fed through the printer the paper is simply a continuous sheet.\n\n[[File:Endlospapier fan-fold paper2.jpg|thumb|Continuous form paper edge perforations]]\nAfter printing the separated sheets can be held in binders by using the sprocket holes when simply required as a record. Alternatively some types of continuous form paper also have longitudinal perforations along each edge inside the engagement holes, allowing the strips with sprocket holes to be torn off the printed page.\n\nThe tear perforations may be short slits, which leave noticeable serrations when torn apart, acceptable for many business documents such as invoices or basic data (such as computer code). Where better appearance is necessary the perforations can be much finer, leaving an almost perfectly smooth edge (microperforations, microperf for short).\n\nContinuous form paper of all types remains in production, although largely supplanted with the introduction of fast laser printers with single-sheet feed. Continuous stationery printed on a suitable printer is typically cheaper than laser printing although the output is of lower quality. If an impact printer is used multiple simultaneous copies can be printed on multipart forms. Many laser printers can print on both sides of the paper (duplex printing), which is not possible with continuous stationery.\n\n== Common types ==\n[[File:Perforation types for continious form paper.gif|thumb|Common perforation types for continuous form paper]]\n[[File:Endlospapier fan-fold paper.jpg|thumb|right|Preprinted green bar continuous form paper]]\nThe highest grade of continuous form paper uses a heavy bond weight similar to typing paper.

Reader's Digest and Publisher's Clearing House relied heavily on these forms to promote their products (most often via sweepstakes), issue billing, address form letter correspondence, and manage their own business data needs.  Continuous form paper is used in some of the fastest types of printing systems, some of which print text at a rate of 20,000 lpm (lines per minute). This will produce about 400 pages per minute, using about 8-11 large boxes of paper for every hour of printing (affected by character density, and other details such as paper weight).<ref>[http://www.mcspro.com/brochures/1_VarioStreamContinuousForm.pdf http://www.mcspro.com/brochures/VarioStreamContinuousForm.pdf] MCS Refurbished Continuous Form Printers</ref><ref>[https://pr.fujitsu.com/en/news/2002/05/30.html https://pr.fujitsu.com] Fujitsu Introduces World's Fastest Continuous-Form Page Printer</ref>   Direct mail, as an industry overall, has been accused of being environmentally unfriendly, due to a high percentage of the mail being discarded without being read.  [[Advertising mail]]\n\n=== Decollator ===\n[[File:Decollator and burster.jpg|thumb|A decollator and a burster]]\nA decollator separates multi-part continuous form paper into separate stacks of one-part continuous form paper and may also remove the carbon paper.\n\n=== Burster ===\n{{Redirect|Burster|the class of binary star|X-ray burster}}\nA burster is a machine that separates one-part continuous form paper into separate, individual, sheets along the transverse perforations. A burster was typically used with printed continuous form paper applications such as mass-mail advertising, invoices, and account statements. Bursting is done by firmly gripping the second-to-last sheet while feed rollers grip the last sheet firmly and pull it away to burst the perforation. The continuous form paper then advances into the feed rollers to burst the next sheet. Bursting is often a high-speed process that allows the continuous form paper to feed in at a steady rate, with burst pages either stacked or fed into a single-sheet conveyance to the next paper processing stage. Burster equipment and paper manufactures had to generate perforation specifications so that the paper perforations reliably separated under the force of pulling the sheets apart and not tear down into the printed part of the sheet.\n\n[[File:Bound computer printout.agr.jpg|thumb|Listing of a large computer program on continuous form paper, bound in a printout binder.]]\nLarge continuous documents might not be split into separate sheets. By continuously folding two single sided printed sheets back-to-back and binding together a stack of continuous form paper along one of the folded edges, it is possible to flip through the stack like a book of double-sided printed pages. With this technique, the stack is normally flipped top to bottom or bottom to top rather than side to side.\n\n== History ==\nThis paper type was developed for use with [[Autographic Register|autographic registers]] around 1910, was later adopted by [[tabulating machine]]s beginning in the 1920s,<ref>http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/tabulator.html</ref> and its use grew with the introduction of commercial computers in the 1950s.  [[Punched cards|IBM cards]], preprinted, optionally numbered and pre-punched, were available as continuous form cards and were used for checks and other documents.<ref name=IBMAcc>{{cite book |author= IBM |title = Principles of IBM Accounting |year= 1953 |id= 224-5527-2}}</ref>  Continuous form paper became widely used and well known to the general public in the 1980s due to the development of [[microcomputer]]s and inexpensive [[Dot matrix printer|dot-matrix]] consumer printers.\n\nContinuous form paper began to disappear from the consumer market in the 1990s as  [[desktop publishing]], and [[WYSIWYG]] document generation became more popular and widespread. Consumers were willing to pay more to get a [[laser printer]] or [[inkjet printer]] that could produce near-typeset-quality documents. These printers accept [[paper size|standard size]] cut sheets (letter, legal or A4) of paper and do not require continuous form paper. Continuous form paper continues to be used in specialty commercial and industrial markets and, as of 2017, is still available from large retailers of [[office supplies]] such as [[OfficeMax]] and [[Staples Inc.|Staples]].\n\nContinuous stationery (also called continuous-forms paper) began to disappear from the commercial market in the 1990s replaced by the invention of Pinless and perf-less paper feeding and folding by HW (Buck) Crowley and introduced by Roll Systems (Now Technau), with much industry resistance. Two years of tradeshow demonstrations before the first sale. This became the pivotal breakthrough that allowed commercial digital printing to become accepted. This is where the vast majority of continuous forms were used. This but many fortune-500 companies out of this business. <ref>Nine of Crowley's many relevant US Patents: US5820007, US5967394, US5979732, US6000595, US6056180,  US6279807, US6305857, US6450383, US7430948</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Film perforations]]\n* [[Paper]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist}}\n* The Free Online Dictionary of Computing\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://foldoc.org/sprocket+feed Related info at the Free On-Line Dictionary Of Computing]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/loudguineapig/2214266932/in/photostream/ Photo of a decollator in operation]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/uncatigger/1925863855/ Photo of a decollator and a burster]\n\n{{Paper products}}\n\n[[Category:Paper products]]\n[[Category:Stationery]]\n[[Category:Computer printers]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- this article has been copied from or to http://vintagecomputers.tumblr.com/post/122038632926/continuous-stationery-continuous-form-paper.

Perforations are very small and close together, referred to as microperforations or microperf, to allow the sheets to be separated and the sprocket hole strip torn off leaving a very smooth edge almost as if [[Paper cutter|guillotine]]-cut.<ref>[http://www.realprintmanagement.co.uk/pages/glossary.html Paper and Printing Glossary: Microperf]</ref>\n\nThe cheapest grade of continuous form paper is often preprinted with bars of light green lines across its width, to facilitate following a line of information across the page, a type commonly referred to as ''[[green bar]]'',<ref>See: {{cite book |last= Evans |first= Christopher |title= The Making of the Micro: A History of the Computer |publisher= VNR |year= 1981 |isbn= 0-442-22240-8 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/makingofmicrohis0000evan_y9p3 }}; the first several pages of book are replicas of green bar form</ref> ''music '' or ''music-ruled'' paper.<ref>[http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/corporate/RBCCOMSYS.NSF/120695309873fa1780256b1200463b76/51bae9a43a35bb9580256f8d0035de39/$FILE/CAB16OCT2002%20EGovernment%20Strategy%20-%20Additional%20Information.doc Rugby Borough Council, e-government and Information Technology strategy]</ref> It is a very lightweight bond, usually without slit perforations to remove the engagement hole strips.\n\nCommon sizes:\n* 241mm x 279mm (9.5in x 11in)\n* 381mm x 279mm (15in x 11in)\n\n== Printing, separation and binding ==\n=== Printing ===\nPrinting on continuous forms was at one time the basis for many business operations, not the least of which the direct mail industry.  Reader's Digest and Publisher's Clearing House relied heavily on these forms to promote their products (most often via sweepstakes), issue billing, address form letter correspondence, and manage their own business data needs.  Continuous form paper is used in some of the fastest types of printing systems, some of which print text at a rate of 20,000 lpm (lines per minute). This will produce about 400 pages per minute, using about 8-11 large boxes of paper for every hour of printing (affected by character density, and other details such as paper weight).<ref>[http://www.mcspro.com/brochures/1_VarioStreamContinuousForm.pdf http://www.mcspro.com/brochures/VarioStreamContinuousForm.pdf] MCS Refurbished Continuous Form Printers</ref><ref>[https://pr.fujitsu.com/en/news/2002/05/30.html https://pr.fujitsu.com] Fujitsu Introduces World's Fastest Continuous-Form Page Printer</ref>   Direct mail, as an industry overall, has been accused of being environmentally unfriendly, due to a high percentage of the mail being discarded without being read.  [[Advertising mail - Environmental Effect|Advertising mail]]\n\n=== Decollator ===\n[[File:Decollator and burster.jpg|thumb|A decollator and a burster]]\nA decollator separates multi-part continuous form paper into separate stacks of one-part continuous form paper and may also remove the carbon paper.\n\n=== Burster ===\n{{Redirect|Burster|the class of binary star|X-ray burster}}\nA burster is a machine that separates one-part continuous form paper into separate, individual, sheets along the transverse perforations. A burster was typically used with printed continuous form paper applications such as mass-mail advertising, invoices, and account statements. Bursting is done by firmly gripping the second-to-last sheet while feed rollers grip the last sheet firmly and pull it away to burst the perforation. The continuous form paper then advances into the feed rollers to burst the next sheet. Bursting is often a high-speed process that allows the continuous form paper to feed in at a steady rate, with burst pages either stacked or fed into a single-sheet conveyance to the next paper processing stage. Burster equipment and paper manufactures had to generate perforation specifications so that the paper perforations reliably separated under the force of pulling the sheets apart and not tear down into the printed part of the sheet.\n\n[[File:Bound computer printout.agr.jpg|thumb|Listing of a large computer program on continuous form paper, bound in a printout binder.]]\nLarge continuous documents might not be split into separate sheets. By continuously folding two single sided printed sheets back-to-back and binding together a stack of continuous form paper along one of the folded edges, it is possible to flip through the stack like a book of double-sided printed pages. With this technique, the stack is normally flipped top to bottom or bottom to top rather than side to side.\n\n== History ==\nThis paper type was developed for use with [[Autographic Register|autographic registers]] around 1910, was later adopted by [[tabulating machine]]s beginning in the 1920s,<ref>http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/tabulator.html</ref> and its use grew with the introduction of commercial computers in the 1950s.  [[Punched cards|IBM cards]], preprinted, optionally numbered and pre-punched, were available as continuous form cards and were used for checks and other documents.<ref name=IBMAcc>{{cite book |author= IBM |title = Principles of IBM Accounting |year= 1953 |id= 224-5527-2}}</ref>  Continuous form paper became widely used and well known to the general public in the 1980s due to the development of [[microcomputer]]s and inexpensive [[Dot matrix printer|dot-matrix]] consumer printers.\n\nContinuous form paper began to disappear from the consumer market in the 1990s as  [[desktop publishing]], and [[WYSIWYG]] document generation became more popular and widespread. Consumers were willing to pay more to get a [[laser printer]] or [[inkjet printer]] that could produce near-typeset-quality documents. These printers accept [[paper size|standard size]] cut sheets (letter, legal or A4) of paper and do not require continuous form paper. Continuous form paper continues to be used in specialty commercial and industrial markets and, as of 2017, is still available from large retailers of [[office supplies]] such as [[OfficeMax]] and [[Staples Inc.|Staples]].\n\nContinuous stationery (also called continuous-forms paper) began to disappear from the commercial market in the 1990s replaced by the invention of Pinless and perf-less paper feeding and folding by HW (Buck) Crowley and introduced by Roll Systems (Now Technau), with much industry resistance. Two years of tradeshow demonstrations before the first sale. This became the pivotal breakthrough that allowed commercial digital printing to become accepted. This is where the vast majority of continuous forms were used. This but many fortune-500 companies out of this business. <ref>Nine of Crowley's many relevant US Patents: US5820007, US5967394, US5979732, US6000595, US6056180,  US6279807, US6305857, US6450383, US7430948</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Film perforations]]\n* [[Paper]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist}}\n* The Free Online Dictionary of Computing\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://foldoc.org/sprocket+feed Related info at the Free On-Line Dictionary Of Computing]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/loudguineapig/2214266932/in/photostream/ Photo of a decollator in operation]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/uncatigger/1925863855/ Photo of a decollator and a burster]\n\n{{Paper products}}\n\n[[Category:Paper products]]\n[[Category:Stationery]]\n[[Category:Computer printers]]\n", "name_user": "Craigandhelen", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePrinting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_stationery"}
