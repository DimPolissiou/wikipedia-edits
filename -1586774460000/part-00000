He credits his determination to become an actor and his respect for comedy to an \"unhealthy [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]] to television\".{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Career==\nAt the age of 15 he landed his first agent and quickly began booking roles in television and film. Before moving from [[Vancouver]] to [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], Sasso starred for five seasons as quirky teen Derek Wakaluk on the award-winning Canadian dramatic series ''[[Madison (TV series)|Madison]]''.\n\n===''MADtv''===\nBy the end of its second season (1996\u20131997), ''MADtv'' experienced its first big cast turnover. Three of the show's repertory performers ([[Bryan Callen]], [[Orlando Jones]] and [[Artie Lange]]) left the cast. As a result, in 1997, casting executives at FOX had to cast replacements for the show. Sasso (along with [[Alex Borstein]] and [[Aries Spears]]) was selected to join the ''MADtv'' third season cast as a regular cast member. Upon his exit, MADtv became known as \"The House that Sasso Built and Bryan Callen squatted in.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSasso is known for quirky characters such as the accident-prone handyman Paul Timberman, Eracist member Hugh, singer Michael McCloud, ''Talkin' American'' host Rui Peranio and Mexican [[Lucha libre|luchador]] Se\u00f1or Bag of Crap.\n\nWill began developing several network television projects with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]/[[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 2001 and in 2002, Sasso left ''MADtv'' to pursue the next stage of his career.\n\n===Professional wrestling===\nSasso is a [[professional wrestling]] fan, and has made appearances with multiple American pro wrestling [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotions]].\n\nSasso engaged in a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)#Worked shoots|worked shoot]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] with former world champion wrestler [[Bret Hart]], which began on February 6, 1999 during Hart's second guest appearance on ''MADtv''. In a sketch lampooning the election of [[Jesse Ventura]] to gubernatorial office, Hart \"[[Breaking character|broke character]]\" and attacked the cast members for making light of wrestling, apparently injuring Sasso. He then appeared in a later episode at the [[curtain call]] during the ending credits and again attacked Sasso in an \"unscripted\" assault. Sasso then appeared at ringside during the February 8, 1999 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', where Hart again attacked him. Sasso retaliated by interfering in Hart's match against [[Roddy Piper]], making him lose the match and the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Championship]]. This led to a grudge match on the February 15, 1999 episode of ''Nitro'', where Sasso appeared with castmate [[Debra Wilson]], who turned on Sasso, making it a one-sided match. During Sasso's time in WCW, commentator [[Bobby Heenan]] would refer to Sasso as \"Will Fatso\".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nSasso's impersonation of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] impressed the [[WWE|WWF]] (as it was then still known, before its name changed to WWE) so much that they asked him to be part of the February 7, 2002 episode of ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|WWF SmackDown!]]'', appearing alongside [[Chris Jericho]] and Austin himself, as a means to promote Austin's upcoming \"MADtv\" appearance.\n\nOn the live April 9, 2012 broadcast of ''[[WWE Raw]]'', he appeared along with the other actors in ''[[The Three Stooges (2012 film)|The Three Stooges]]'' movie, alternating between [[Curly Howard|Curly]] and [[Hulk Hogan]] impersonations.

He is notable for his five seasons as a cast member on ''[[Mad TV]]'' from 1997 to 2002 and for starring as [[Curly Howard|Curly]] in the 2012 film reboot of ''[[The Three Stooges (2012 film)|The Three Stooges]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nSasso was born in [[Ladner, British Columbia]], to Italian immigrants.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=Ten Minute Podcast|title=Ten Minute Podcast - 285 - Setting Parameters|date=2017-06-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPppzEZ7us4|accessdate=2018-06-06}}</ref> He graduated from Delta Secondary School in [[Delta, British Columbia]] in 1993. He credits his determination to become an actor and his respect for comedy to an \"unhealthy [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]] to television\".{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Career==\nAt the age of 15 he landed his first agent and quickly began booking roles in television and film. Before moving from [[Vancouver]] to [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], Sasso starred for five seasons as quirky teen Derek Wakaluk on the award-winning Canadian dramatic series ''[[Madison (TV series)|Madison]]''.\n\n===''MADtv''===\nBy the end of its second season (1996\u20131997), ''MADtv'' experienced its first big cast turnover. Three of the show's repertory performers ([[Bryan Callen]], [[Orlando Jones]] and [[Artie Lange]]) left the cast. As a result, in 1997, casting executives at FOX had to cast replacements for the show. Sasso (along with [[Alex Borstein]] and [[Aries Spears]]) was selected to join the ''MADtv'' third season cast as a regular cast member. Upon his exit, MADtv became known as \"The House that Sasso Built and Bryan Callen squatted in.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSasso is known for quirky characters such as the accident-prone handyman Paul Timberman, Eracist member Hugh, singer Michael McCloud, ''Talkin' American'' host Rui Peranio and Mexican [[Lucha libre|luchador]] Se\u00f1or Bag of Crap.\n\nWill began developing several network television projects with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]/[[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 2001 and in 2002, Sasso left ''MADtv'' to pursue the next stage of his career.\n\n===Professional wrestling===\nSasso is a [[professional wrestling]] fan, and has made appearances with multiple American pro wrestling [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotions]].\n\nSasso engaged in a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)#Worked shoots|worked shoot]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] with former world champion wrestler [[Bret Hart]], which began on February 6, 1999 during Hart's second guest appearance on ''MADtv''. In a sketch lampooning the election of [[Jesse Ventura]] to gubernatorial office, Hart \"[[Breaking character|broke character]]\" and attacked the cast members for making light of wrestling, apparently injuring Sasso. He then appeared in a later episode at the [[curtain call]] during the ending credits and again attacked Sasso in an \"unscripted\" assault. Sasso then appeared at ringside during the February 8, 1999 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', where Hart again attacked him. Sasso retaliated by interfering in Hart's match against [[Roddy Piper]], making him lose the match and the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Championship]]. This led to a grudge match on the February 15, 1999 episode of ''Nitro'', where Sasso appeared with castmate [[Debra Wilson]], who turned on Sasso, making it a one-sided match. During Sasso's time in WCW, commentator [[Bobby Heenan]] would refer to Sasso as \"Will Fatso\".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nSasso's impersonation of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] impressed the [[WWE|WWF]] (as it was then still known, before its name changed to WWE) so much that they asked him to be part of the February 7, 2002 episode of ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|WWF SmackDown!]]'', appearing alongside [[Chris Jericho]] and Austin himself, as a means to promote Austin's upcoming \"MADtv\" appearance.\n\nOn the live April 9, 2012 broadcast of ''[[WWE Raw]]'', he appeared along with the other actors in ''[[The Three Stooges (2012 film)|The Three Stooges]]'' movie, alternating between [[Curly Howard|Curly]] and [[Hulk Hogan]] impersonations. He was chokeslammed by [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]].\n\nSasso also appeared on a ''[[WWE Main Event]]'' promo for [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\n===Later projects===\nSince leaving ''[[MADtv]]'', Sasso's television appearances include four seasons as Carl Monari on ''[[Less than Perfect]]'', as well as a role in ''[[Robson Arms]]''. Sasso also played the role of Fortunio Balducci in ''[[Southland Tales]]''. Sasso starred in ''[[$h*! My Dad Says]]'', based on the [[Twitter]] feed [[Shit My Dad Says]] created by Justin Halpern.

Much criticism was directed at Lorenz's extension of his findings on non-human animals to humans.\n\n==Publication==\n\n''On Aggression'' was first published in German in 1963, and in English in 1966.

This behavior must be considered part of [[natural selection]], as aggression leading to death or serious injury may eventually lead to extinction unless it has such a role.\n\nHowever, Lorenz does ''not'' state that aggressive behaviors are in any way more powerful, prevalent, or intense than more peaceful behaviors such as [[mating]] rituals. Rather, he negates the categorization of aggression as \"contrary\" to \"positive\" instincts like [[love]], depicting it as a founding basis of other instincts and its role in [[animal communication]].\n\n{{anchor|Hydraulic model}}\n\n===Hydraulic model===\n[[File:Lorenz_hydraulic_model.svg|thumb|The psycho-hydraulic model of Lorenz]]\nAdditionally, Lorenz addresses behavior in humans, including discussion of a \"[[hydraulic]]\" model of emotional or instinctive pressures and their release, shared by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s [[psychoanalytic theory]], and the abnormality of intraspecies violence and killing. His 'hydraulic' model, of aggression as a force that builds relentlessly without cause unless released, remains less popular than a model in which aggression is a response to frustrated desires and aims.\n\n===Ritualization===\n{{see|Ritualization}}\n\nIn the book, Lorenz describes the development of rituals among aggressive behaviors as beginning with a totally utilitarian action, but then [[evolution|evolving]] to more and more stylized actions, until finally, the action performed may be entirely symbolic and non-utilitarian, now fulfilling a function of communication. In Lorenz's words:\n\n{{quote|Thus while the message of inciting [a particular aggressive behavior performed by the female of cooperating mated pairs] in [[ruddy shelduck]] and [[Egyptian geese]] could be expressed in the words 'Drive him off, thrash him!', in [[diving duck]]s [a related species in which this trait has been further ritualized] it simply means, 'I love you.' In several groups, midway between these two extremes, as for example in the [[gadwall]] and [[widgeon]], an intermediate meaning may be found, 'You are my hero. I rely on you.'<ref name=\"Lorenz2002\">{{cite book|author=Konrad Lorenz|title=On Aggression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rIVK7wuY3kIC&pg=PA61|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-28320-5|pages=61\u2013}}</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Favourable===\n\nJ. L. Fischer, reviewing ''On Aggression'' in ''American Anthropologist'' in 1968, called it a \"fascinating book by a distinguished anima ethologist\" that would \"annoy most social and cultural anthropologists\" but nonetheless stated \"an important thesis\", namely that intraspecific aggression was \"instinctive in man, as it can be shown to be in a number of other species.\"<ref name=\"Fischer 1968\">{{cite journal | last=Fischer | first=J.

Fischer argued that Lorenz's view of the instinctive nature of human aggression was \"basically right\", commenting that \"Lorenz would probably cite the fury of his critics as further proof of the correctness of his thesis\".<ref name=\"Fischer 1968\"/>\n\nEdmund R. Leach, comparing the book with [[Robert Ardrey]]'s ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]'' in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' in 1966, calls ''On Aggression'' \"no landmark, but .. modest and wise, while Ardrey's version is only noisy and foolish.\"<ref name=\"Leach 1966\">{{cite news |last1=Leach |first1=Edmund R. |title=Don't Say 'Boo' to a Goose |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=15 December 1966 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1966/12/15/dont-say-boo-to-a-goose/ |accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> Leach writes that where Ardrey focuses on territoriality, Lorenz aims to demonstrate that \"animal aggression is only a 'so-called evil' and that its [[adaptation|adaptive]] consequences are advantageous or at least neutral.\"<ref name=\"Leach 1966\"/> Leach is however less sure that Lorenz is correct to equate animal and human aggression, the one taking standard ritualized forms, the other far more complex.<ref name=\"Leach 1966\"/>\n\nThe mental health researcher Peter M. Driver reviewed the book in ''Conflict Resolution'' in 1967 alongside two by Ardrey and one by Claire Russell and W. M. S. Russell, ''Human Behavior \u2013 A New Approach''. He commented that those against the book, especially S. A. Barnett, [[T. C. Schneirla]], and [[Solly Zuckerman]], were specialists in animal behaviour, while most of the favourable reviews came from \"experts in other fields\". Driver stated that Lorenz had provided a \"powerful thesis\" to explain the \"aggression gone wrong\" in humans, mentioning the millions of deaths in world wars, aggression resembling (Driver argued) the unlimited interspecific attack of a [[predator]] on its prey rather than the kind of intraspecific aggression seen in nonhuman animals which is strictly limited. Driver concluded that ethology could contribute, alongside [[neurophysiology]] and [[psychology]], to resolving the problem of conflict.<ref name=\"Driver\">{{cite journal |last1=Driver |first1=Peter M. |title=Toward an ethology of human conflict: a review |journal=Conflict Resolution |date=1967 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=361\u2013374 |doi=10.1177/002200276701100310 |url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/67149/10.1177_002200276701100310.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y}}</ref>\n\n===Critical===\n\nThe zoologists Richard D.

They call ''On Aggression'' a personal commentary from a professional zoologist where Ardrey's book is a well-documented book by a non-biologist. Both, in their view, tend \"to rekindle old, pointless arguments of the [[nature versus nurture|instinct vs. learning]] variety\"<ref name=\"AlexanderTinkle1968\"/> and both include \"some peculiarly nonevolutionary or antievolutionary themes.\"<ref name=\"AlexanderTinkle1968\"/>\n\nThe psychoanalyst [[Erich Fromm]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1972, called Lorenz's theory \"complicated and sometimes fuzzy\".<ref name=\"FrommNYT1972\">{{cite news |last1=Fromm |first1=Erich |authorlink1=Erich Fromm |title=The Erich Fromm Theory of Aggression |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/27/archives/the-erich-fromm-theory-of-aggression.html |accessdate=18 May 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=27 February 1972 |page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Fromm, Erich |authorlink=Erich Fromm |title=The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-8050-1604-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/anatomyofhumande00from_0 }}</ref> Fromm considered that in one way Lorenz had succeeded where [[Sigmund Freud]] had failed, Lorenz's hydraulic theory of aggression, innately programmed, being in Fromm's view a better explanation than Freud's opposed passions, the supposed [[Libido|drives for life]] (eros) and [[Death drive|death or destruction]] (thanatos).<ref name=\"FrommNYT1972\"/> However, Fromm noted that the ethologist [[Nico Tinbergen]] had rejected the hydraulic theory, and that Lorenz himself \"modified it\" in 1966, but without indicating that in the English translation of ''On Aggression''.<ref name=\"FrommNYT1972\"/> Fromm cites evidence from [[neuroscience]] that aggression is \"essentially defensive\", arising in \"phylogenetically programed brain areas\" for [[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]] when an animal or person feels threatened. Fromm points out that \"self-propelling aggressiveness\" is seen in people with brain disease, but not in \"normal brain functioning\".<ref name=\"FrommNYT1972\"/> \n\nThe biologist [[E. O. Wilson]], in ''[[On Human Nature]]'' (1978), argues that both Lorenz and Fromm are essentially wrong. He lists a variety of aggression categories, each separately subject to [[natural selection]], and states that aggressive behavior is, genetically, one of the most [[wiktionary:labile|labile]] of all traits. He maintains that aggression is a technique used to gain control over necessary resources, and serves as a \"[[Density dependence|density-dependent]] factor\" in population control. He argues against the \"drive-discharge\" model created by Freud and Lorenz, where substitute aggressive activities (such as combative sports) should reduce the potential for war, and in support of Richard G. Sipes's \"culture-pattern\" model, where war and substitute activities will vary directly. Wilson compares aggression to \"a preexisting mix of chemicals ready to be transformed by specific catalysts that are added,\" rather than \"a fluid that continuously builds pressure against the walls of its containers.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first = E.

Rather, he negates the categorization of aggression as \"contrary\" to \"positive\" instincts like [[love]], depicting it as a founding basis of other instincts and its role in [[animal communication]].\n\n{{anchor|Hydraulic model}}\n\n===Hydraulic model===\n[[File:Lorenz_hydraulic_model.svg|thumb|The psycho-hydraulic model of Lorenz]]\nAdditionally, Lorenz addresses behavior in humans, including discussion of a \"[[hydraulic]]\" model of emotional or instinctive pressures and their release, shared by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s [[psychoanalytic theory]], and the abnormality of intraspecies violence and killing. His 'hydraulic' model, of aggression as a force that builds relentlessly without cause unless released, remains less popular than a model in which aggression is a response to frustrated desires and aims.\n\n===Ritualization===\n{{see|Ritualization}}\n\nIn the book, Lorenz describes the development of rituals among aggressive behaviors as beginning with a totally utilitarian action, but then [[evolution|evolving]] to more and more stylized actions, until finally, the action performed may be entirely symbolic and non-utilitarian, now fulfilling a function of communication. In Lorenz's words:\n\n{{quote|Thus while the message of inciting [a particular aggressive behavior performed by the female of cooperating mated pairs] in [[ruddy shelduck]] and [[Egyptian geese]] could be expressed in the words 'Drive him off, thrash him!', in [[diving duck]]s [a related species in which this trait has been further ritualized] it simply means, 'I love you.' In several groups, midway between these two extremes, as for example in the [[gadwall]] and [[widgeon]], an intermediate meaning may be found, 'You are my hero. I rely on you.'<ref name=\"Lorenz2002\">{{cite book|author=Konrad Lorenz|title=On Aggression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rIVK7wuY3kIC&pg=PA61|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-28320-5|pages=61\u2013}}</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Favourable===\n\nJ. L. Fischer, reviewing ''On Aggression'' in ''American Anthropologist'' in 1968, called it a \"fascinating book by a distinguished anima ethologist\" that would \"annoy most social and cultural anthropologists\" but nonetheless stated \"an important thesis\", namely that intraspecific aggression was \"instinctive in man, as it can be shown to be in a number of other species.\"<ref name=\"Fischer 1968\">{{cite journal | last=Fischer | first=J.

Fischer argued that Lorenz's view of the instinctive nature of human aggression was \"basically right\", commenting that \"Lorenz would probably cite the fury of his critics as further proof of the correctness of his thesis\".<ref name=\"Fischer 1968\"/>\n\nEdmund R. Leach, comparing the book with [[Robert Ardrey]]'s ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]'' in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' in 1966, calls ''On Aggression'' \"no landmark, but .. modest and wise, while Ardrey's version is only noisy and foolish.\"<ref name=\"Leach 1966\">{{cite news |last1=Leach |first1=Edmund R. |title=Don't Say 'Boo' to a Goose |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=15 December 1966 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1966/12/15/dont-say-boo-to-a-goose/ |accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> Leach writes that where Ardrey focuses on territoriality, Lorenz aims to demonstrate that \"animal aggression is only a 'so-called evil' and that its [[adaptation|adaptive]] consequences are advantageous or at least neutral.\"<ref name=\"Leach 1966\"/> Leach is however less sure that Lorenz is correct to equate animal and human aggression, the one taking standard ritualized forms, the other far more complex.<ref name=\"Leach 1966\"/>\n\nThe mental health researcher Peter M. Driver reviewed the book in ''Conflict Resolution'' in 1967 alongside two by Ardrey and one by Claire Russell and W. M. S. Russell, ''Human Behavior \u2013 A New Approach''. He commented that those against the book, especially S. A. Barnett, [[T. C. Schneirla]], and [[Solly Zuckerman]], were specialists in animal behaviour, while most of the favourable reviews came from \"experts in other fields\". Driver stated that Lorenz had provided a \"powerful thesis\" to explain the \"aggression gone wrong\" in humans, mentioning the millions of deaths in world wars, aggression resembling (Driver argued) the unlimited interspecific attack of a [[predator]] on its prey rather than the kind of intraspecific aggression seen in nonhuman animals which is strictly limited. Driver concluded that ethology could contribute, alongside [[neurophysiology]] and [[psychology]], to resolving the problem of conflict.<ref name=\"Driver\">{{cite journal |last1=Driver |first1=Peter M. |title=Toward an ethology of human conflict: a review |journal=Conflict Resolution |date=1967 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=361\u2013374 |doi=10.1177/002200276701100310 |url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/67149/10.1177_002200276701100310.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y}}</ref>\n\n===Critical===\n\nThe zoologists Richard D. Alexander and Donald W. Tinkle, comparing ''On Aggression'' with Ardrey's ''The Territorial Imperative'' in ''[[BioScience]]'' in 1968, noted that few books had been reviewed so often \"or with as much vehemence in both defense and derogation\" as these two.<ref name=\"AlexanderTinkle1968\">{{cite journal |last1=Alexander |first1=Richard D. |last2=Tinkle |first2=Donald W. |title=A Comparative Review {{!}} On Aggression by Konrad Lorenz; The Territorial Imperative by Robert Ardrey |journal=BioScience |date=March 1968 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=245\u2013248 |doi=10.2307/1294259 |jstor=1294259}}</ref> In their view, this was because both men had tried to write about a sensitive and important question, human nature and to what extent it is determined by evolution. They call ''On Aggression'' a personal commentary from a professional zoologist where Ardrey's book is a well-documented book by a non-biologist. Both, in their view, tend \"to rekindle old, pointless arguments of the [[nature versus nurture|instinct vs. learning]] variety\"<ref name=\"AlexanderTinkle1968\"/> and both include \"some peculiarly nonevolutionary or antievolutionary themes.\"<ref name=\"AlexanderTinkle1968\"/>\n\nThe psychoanalyst [[Erich Fromm]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1972, called Lorenz's theory \"complicated and sometimes fuzzy\".<ref name=\"FrommNYT1972\">{{cite news |last1=Fromm |first1=Erich |authorlink1=Erich Fromm |title=The Erich Fromm Theory of Aggression |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/27/archives/the-erich-fromm-theory-of-aggression.html |accessdate=18 May 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=27 February 1972 |page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Fromm, Erich |authorlink=Erich Fromm |title=The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-8050-1604-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/anatomyofhumande00from_0 }}</ref> Fromm considered that in one way Lorenz had succeeded where [[Sigmund Freud]] had failed, Lorenz's hydraulic theory of aggression, innately programmed, being in Fromm's view a better explanation than Freud's opposed passions, the supposed [[Libido|drives for life]] (eros) and [[Death drive|death or destruction]] (thanatos).<ref name=\"FrommNYT1972\"/> However, Fromm noted that the ethologist [[Nico Tinbergen]] had rejected the hydraulic theory, and that Lorenz himself \"modified it\" in 1966, but without indicating that in the English translation of ''On Aggression''.<ref name=\"FrommNYT1972\"/> Fromm cites evidence from [[neuroscience]] that aggression is \"essentially defensive\", arising in \"phylogenetically programed brain areas\" for [[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]] when an animal or person feels threatened. Fromm points out that \"self-propelling aggressiveness\" is seen in people with brain disease, but not in \"normal brain functioning\".<ref name=\"FrommNYT1972\"/> \n\nThe biologist [[E. O. Wilson]], in ''[[On Human Nature]]'' (1978), argues that both Lorenz and Fromm are essentially wrong. He lists a variety of aggression categories, each separately subject to [[natural selection]], and states that aggressive behavior is, genetically, one of the most [[wiktionary:labile|labile]] of all traits. He maintains that aggression is a technique used to gain control over necessary resources, and serves as a \"[[Density dependence|density-dependent]] factor\" in population control. He argues against the \"drive-discharge\" model created by Freud and Lorenz, where substitute aggressive activities (such as combative sports) should reduce the potential for war, and in support of Richard G. Sipes's \"culture-pattern\" model, where war and substitute activities will vary directly. Wilson compares aggression to \"a preexisting mix of chemicals ready to be transformed by specific catalysts that are added,\" rather than \"a fluid that continuously builds pressure against the walls of its containers.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first = E.

He criticises ''On Aggression'' for its \"gem of a [[circular argument]]\" that aggressive behaviour has a \"species preserving\" function, namely to ensure \"that only the fittest individuals are allowed to breed\". In Dawkins's view, the idea of [[group selection]] was \"so deeply ingrained\" in Lorenz's thinking that he \"evidently did not realize that his statements contravened [[Neo-Darwinism|orthodox Darwinian theory]].\"<ref>{{cite book| last=Dawkins |first=Richard | authorlink=Richard Dawkins | title=The Selfish Gene |title-link=The Selfish Gene | edition=1st | year=1976 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0198575191 | pages=9, 72}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!--The following items should probably be removed from here, mentioned in article text, and linked there-->\n* [[Hunting hypothesis]]\n* [[Killer ape theory]]\n* [[Social defeat]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Biology|Animals}}\n{{Natural history}}\n\n[[Category:Works by Konrad Lorenz]]\n[[Category:Aggression]]\n[[Category:1966 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Methuen Publishing books]]\n", "name_user": "Goochelaar", "label": "safe", "comment": "Punctuation in the original title", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Aggression"}

They have been issuing this type of passports to all of their citizens since August 25, 2008.\n\nThe South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs formed the \"Committee for promoting e-passports\" in April 2006, and it was scheduled to issue biometric passports in the second half of 2008. On September 4, 2007, the media reported that the South Korean government decided to revise its passport law to issue biometric passports which include fingerprint information, first to the diplomats in the first quarter of 2008, and the rest of the public in the second half of the year. Some civil liberties have caused some controversy over the fingerprinting requirement because the [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] only requires a photograph be recorded on the chip.\n\nOn February 26, 2008, the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|South Korean legislature]] passed a revision of the passport law. A new biometric passport was issued to diplomats in March, and to the general public shortly thereafter. Fingerprinting measures would not be implemented immediately; however, they began January 1, 2010.\n\nThe appearance of the new biometric passports is almost identical to the former machine-readable versions, and they both have 48 pages. However, the space for visas was reduced by six pages. These pages are now reserved for identification purposes, notices and other information, as well as the bearer's [[address book|contacts]]. In the new biometric passports, the main identification page has moved to the second page from inside the front cover. The note from the Foreign Affairs Minister is still shown on the front page and the signature is shown on the page after photo identification.\n\nThe new biometric passport incorporates many security features such as colour shifting ink, hologram, ghost image, [[infrared]] ink, [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]], laser perforation of the passport number (from the third page to the back cover), [[latent image]], [[microprinting]], [[security thread]], [[solvent]] sensitive ink, and [[steganography]].<ref name=\"english.komsco.com\"/>\n\nInside the backcover, a caution for the biometric chip is written both in Korean,\n<blockquote>\n\"\uc8fc\uc758 \u2013 \uc774 \uc5ec\uad8c\uc5d0\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc804\uc790\uce69\uc774 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc811\uac70\ub098 \uad6c\uba4d\uc744 \ub6ab\ub294 \ud589\uc704 \ub610\ub294 \uadf9\ud55c \ud658\uacbd(\uc628\ub3c4,\uc2b5\ub3c4)\uc5d0\uc758 \ub178\ucd9c\ub85c \uc5ec\uad8c\uc774 \uc190\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub2c8 \ucde8\uae09\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc2dc\uae30 \ubc14\ub78d\ub2c8\ub2e4.\"\n</blockquote>\nand in English,\n<blockquote>\n\"This passport contains sensitive electronics, For best performance please do not bend, perforate or expose to extreme temperatures or excess moisture.\"\n</blockquote>\nThe passport holders' contact information that was originally held inside the backcover has also been moved to the last page of the new passport.\n\n==Production==\nAs of January 2009, the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation takes eight hours to produce the new biometric passport and is capable of producing 26,500 passports per day.<ref name=\"english.komsco.com\"/>\n\n==Visa free travel==\n{{Main|Visa requirements for South Korean citizens}}\n[[File:Visa requirements for South Korean citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for South Korean citizens]]]]\nVisa requirements for [[South Korea]]n citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Republic of Korea]]. As of 15 January 2019, South Korean citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 189 countries and territories, ranking the South Korean passport second in the world in terms of travel freedom (tied with the Singaporean passport, and one ranking down from the Japanese passport) according to the [[Henley Passport Index]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2018|url=https://www.henleypassportindex.com/assets/PI_2018_INFOGRAPHS_GLOBAL_180215.pdf|publisher=Henley & Partners|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref> Additionally, [[Arton Capital's Passport Index]] currently rank the South Korean passport third in the world in terms of travel freedom, with a visa-free score of 165 (tied with Danish, Dutch, French, Finnish, Italian, Luxembourgish, Norwegian, Singaporean, Spanish, Swedish and United States passports), as of 15 January 2019.<ref>https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php</ref>\n\nAs of October 2018, the passports of South Korea, [[Bruneian passport|Brunei]] and [[Chilean passport|Chile]] are the only ones to provide visa-free access to all [[G8]] countries.\n\n==Inter-Korea travel==\nThe South Korean (Republic of Korea) constitution considers North Korea ([[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]]) as part of its territory, although under a different administration. In other words, the South does not view going to and from the North as breaking the continuity of a person's stay, as long as the traveler does not land on third country, i.e. non-Korean, territory.\n\nHowever, because of the political situation between the South and the isolated [[Socialist state|socialist]] ''[[Juche]]'' government of [[North Korea]], it is almost impossible to enter the North from the South across the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean DMZ]] (exiting South Korea via the [[38th parallel north|northern border]]). Tourists wishing to enter North Korea have to pass through another country, and most enter from [[China]], because most flights to/from [[Pyongyang]] serve [[Beijing]].\n\nSouth Koreans are generally not allowed to visit [[North Korea]], except with special authorizations granted by the [[Ministry of Unification]] and North Korean authorities on a limited basis (e.g. workers and businessmen visiting or commuting to/from [[Kaesong Industrial Complex]]). South Koreans who are allowed to visit North Korea are issued a [[Visa policy of North Korea|North Korean visa]] on a separate sheet of paper, not in the South Korean passport. The Republic of Korea passport can be used to enter North Korea, because passport is one of the government's approved identity documents, but it is being only to prove the bearer's identity, not to determine the bearer's legal residence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hyundai-asan.com/customer/faq.jsp?page=2&section=2#|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> South Koreans can also use other government approved identity documents such as [[South Korean identity card|National ID Card]] and [[Driver's license|Driver's License]], because the South Korean government treats North Korea as part of South Korea and expects South Korean IDs to be accepted.\n\nIn 1998, visa-free travel to the tourist resort of [[Mount Kumgang]] and the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]] was made possible under the \"[[sunshine policy]]\" orchestrated by South Korean President [[Kim Dae-jung]]. Those wishing to travel across the DMZ were given special travel certificates issued by the [[Ministry of Unification]] through [[Hyundai Asan]]. In July 2008, a female tourist named Park Wang-ja was shot to death by a North Korean guard on a beach near [[Mount Kumgang]], which led to the suspension of the tours. As of March 2010 all travel across the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] has now been suspended due to increasing tensions between North and South Korea. However in 2018, [[Kim Jong-un]] and others went to South Korea through the DMZ and met up with South Korean officials. They discussed reunification.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/27/as-kim-walks-across-border-germany-has-an-idea-how-to-tear-down-that-wall-for-real/%3Futm_term%3D.a0c68c66749e&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjn8LHEqO7aAhVCbrwKHQj_CiIQFggOMAE&usg=AOvVaw0sI7KwTz1L2q0K3qBIMCmE</ref>\n\nThere are four land [[border checkpoint]]s in South Korea for inter-Korea travel.\n\n==Restricted nations==\n{{Wikinews|19 South Koreans return home after release from Taliban captivity}}\nThe South Korean government has banned [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], [[Somalia]], [[Syria]] and [[Yemen]] as travel destinations for safety.<ref>[http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130723001032 S.

Some civil liberties have caused some controversy over the fingerprinting requirement because the [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] only requires a photograph be recorded on the chip.\n\nOn February 26, 2008, the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|South Korean legislature]] passed a revision of the passport law. A new biometric passport was issued to diplomats in March, and to the general public shortly thereafter. Fingerprinting measures would not be implemented immediately; however, they began January 1, 2010.\n\nThe appearance of the new biometric passports is almost identical to the former machine-readable versions, and they both have 48 pages. However, the space for visas was reduced by six pages. These pages are now reserved for identification purposes, notices and other information, as well as the bearer's [[address book|contacts]]. In the new biometric passports, the main identification page has moved to the second page from inside the front cover. The note from the Foreign Affairs Minister is still shown on the front page and the signature is shown on the page after photo identification.\n\nThe new biometric passport incorporates many security features such as colour shifting ink, hologram, ghost image, [[infrared]] ink, [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]], laser perforation of the passport number (from the third page to the back cover), [[latent image]], [[microprinting]], [[security thread]], [[solvent]] sensitive ink, and [[steganography]].<ref name=\"english.komsco.com\"/>\n\nInside the backcover, a caution for the biometric chip is written both in Korean,\n<blockquote>\n\"\uc8fc\uc758 \u2013 \uc774 \uc5ec\uad8c\uc5d0\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc804\uc790\uce69\uc774 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc811\uac70\ub098 \uad6c\uba4d\uc744 \ub6ab\ub294 \ud589\uc704 \ub610\ub294 \uadf9\ud55c \ud658\uacbd(\uc628\ub3c4,\uc2b5\ub3c4)\uc5d0\uc758 \ub178\ucd9c\ub85c \uc5ec\uad8c\uc774 \uc190\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub2c8 \ucde8\uae09\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc2dc\uae30 \ubc14\ub78d\ub2c8\ub2e4.\"\n</blockquote>\nand in English,\n<blockquote>\n\"This passport contains sensitive electronics, For best performance please do not bend, perforate or expose to extreme temperatures or excess moisture.\"\n</blockquote>\nThe passport holders' contact information that was originally held inside the backcover has also been moved to the last page of the new passport.\n\n==Production==\nAs of January 2009, the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation takes eight hours to produce the new biometric passport and is capable of producing 26,500 passports per day.<ref name=\"english.komsco.com\"/>\n\n==Visa free travel==\n{{Main|Visa requirements for South Korean citizens}}\n[[File:Visa requirements for South Korean citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for South Korean citizens]]]]\nVisa requirements for [[South Korea]]n citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Republic of Korea]]. As of 15 January 2019, South Korean citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 189 countries and territories, ranking the South Korean passport second in the world in terms of travel freedom (tied with the Singaporean passport, and one ranking down from the Japanese passport) according to the [[Henley Passport Index]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2018|url=https://www.henleypassportindex.com/assets/PI_2018_INFOGRAPHS_GLOBAL_180215.pdf|publisher=Henley & Partners|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref> Additionally, [[Arton Capital's Passport Index]] currently rank the South Korean passport third in the world in terms of travel freedom, with a visa-free score of 165 (tied with Danish, Dutch, French, Finnish, Italian, Luxembourgish, Norwegian, Singaporean, Spanish, Swedish and United States passports), as of 15 January 2019.<ref>https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php</ref>\n\nAs of October 2018, the passports of South Korea, [[Bruneian passport|Brunei]] and [[Chilean passport|Chile]] are the only ones to provide visa-free access to all [[G8]] countries.\n\n==Inter-Korea travel==\nThe South Korean (Republic of Korea) constitution considers North Korea ([[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]]) as part of its territory, although under a different administration. In other words, the South does not view going to and from the North as breaking the continuity of a person's stay, as long as the traveler does not land on third country, i.e. non-Korean, territory.\n\nHowever, because of the political situation between the South and the isolated [[Socialist state|socialist]] ''[[Juche]]'' government of [[North Korea]], it is almost impossible to enter the North from the South across the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean DMZ]] (exiting South Korea via the [[38th parallel north|northern border]]). Tourists wishing to enter North Korea have to pass through another country, and most enter from [[China]], because most flights to/from [[Pyongyang]] serve [[Beijing]].\n\nSouth Koreans are generally not allowed to visit [[North Korea]], except with special authorizations granted by the [[Ministry of Unification]] and North Korean authorities on a limited basis (e.g. workers and businessmen visiting or commuting to/from [[Kaesong Industrial Complex]]). South Koreans who are allowed to visit North Korea are issued a [[Visa policy of North Korea|North Korean visa]] on a separate sheet of paper, not in the South Korean passport. The Republic of Korea passport can be used to enter North Korea, because passport is one of the government's approved identity documents, but it is being only to prove the bearer's identity, not to determine the bearer's legal residence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hyundai-asan.com/customer/faq.jsp?page=2&section=2#|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> South Koreans can also use other government approved identity documents such as [[South Korean identity card|National ID Card]] and [[Driver's license|Driver's License]], because the South Korean government treats North Korea as part of South Korea and expects South Korean IDs to be accepted.\n\nIn 1998, visa-free travel to the tourist resort of [[Mount Kumgang]] and the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]] was made possible under the \"[[sunshine policy]]\" orchestrated by South Korean President [[Kim Dae-jung]]. Those wishing to travel across the DMZ were given special travel certificates issued by the [[Ministry of Unification]] through [[Hyundai Asan]]. In July 2008, a female tourist named Park Wang-ja was shot to death by a North Korean guard on a beach near [[Mount Kumgang]], which led to the suspension of the tours. As of March 2010 all travel across the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] has now been suspended due to increasing tensions between North and South Korea. However in 2018, [[Kim Jong-un]] and others went to South Korea through the DMZ and met up with South Korean officials. They discussed reunification.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/27/as-kim-walks-across-border-germany-has-an-idea-how-to-tear-down-that-wall-for-real/%3Futm_term%3D.a0c68c66749e&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjn8LHEqO7aAhVCbrwKHQj_CiIQFggOMAE&usg=AOvVaw0sI7KwTz1L2q0K3qBIMCmE</ref>\n\nThere are four land [[border checkpoint]]s in South Korea for inter-Korea travel.\n\n==Restricted nations==\n{{Wikinews|19 South Koreans return home after release from Taliban captivity}}\nThe South Korean government has banned [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], [[Somalia]], [[Syria]] and [[Yemen]] as travel destinations for safety.<ref>[http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130723001032 S.

Currently, there is no competition between pharmacies and medical service stores for the sale of drugs.<ref name=\":105\" /> Thus, the price of drugs is uncontrolled.<ref name=\":87\"/> The Fair Price program creates a [[bidding system]] for cheaper prices of medications between drugstores and allows the store with the greatest discount to sell the drug. The program has a minimal cost for the government as fair price shops take the place of drugstores at government hospitals, thus eliminating the need to create new infrastructure for fair price shops.<ref name=\":105\" /> Furthermore, the drugs are [[unbranded]] and must be prescribed by their [[Generic drug|generic]] name.<ref name=\":105\" /> As there is less advertising required for generic brands, fair price shops require minimal payment from the private sector.<ref name=\":105\" /> Fair Price Shops were introduced in the [[West Bengal]] in 2012.
