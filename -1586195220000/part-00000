[[Allmusic]] concluded, \"''The native of Chester, PA (near Philadelphia) was 25 at the time, but this is such a mature, emotionally honest effort that one got the impression he'd done more living than usual during his 25 years. Ryan's voice is rough and has a very lived-in quality that proves most appropriate on such tales of loss, disappointment, and hurt as \"Watch Your Step,\" \"Chrome,\" and \"Lights of the Commodore Barry.\" There isn't a lot of hope or optimism here; Ryan obviously didn't hesitate to let some of his darker feelings flow when he went into the studio to record this album, which is as pessimistic as it is soulful, moving and personal.''\"<ref name=\"AllMusicBiography2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/may-day-mw0000027686 | title=AllMusic Review by Alex Henderson | publisher=[[All Music]] | accessdate=July 19, 2015 | author=Henderson, Alex}}</ref> A video was made for \"Guilty\".

The material was stark and bare, ''[[Concussion (album)|Concussion]]'' was recorded and mixed in 8 days with Richard McLaurin. It was released in 2001 on [[Nashville, Tennessee]] label ''WaxySilver'' and features a duet with [[Lucinda Williams]]. Ryan was asked by actor/director [[Edward Burns]] to contribute a song to his film ''[[Ash Wednesday]]''. \"[[Be Thou My Vision]]\" was used on the [[closing credits]] of the film. Ryan opened tours for Kasey Chambers and Lucinda Williams for much of 2001, along with his own headlining shows.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n2002 was a quiet period for Ryan, eventually releasing two collections of [[Stereo-Pak]] [[Demo (music)|demo recordings]], ''[[Dissent from the Living Room]]'' and ''[[Hopeless to Hopeful]]''.

In April, ''[[Concussion (album)|Concussion]]'' was released in the UK and Europe through [[One Little Indian Records]]. This included a UK tour with label mate [[Jeff Klein]]. On September 9, 2003, [[One Little Indian Records]] also released ''[[Happiness (Matthew Ryan album)|Happiness]]'' in the UK and Europe only, a collection of songs taken from Ryan's self-distributed collections ''Dissent from the Living Room'' and ''Hopeless to Hopeful''. Ryan made another self-distributed release in December entitled ''[[These Are Field Recordings]]'', a two-disc collection of live recordings and early tracks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n===2006- Strays Don't Sleep===\n\n{{Main|Strays Don't Sleep}}\n\nMatthew Ryan approached [[Neilson Hubbard]] in 2004 about a collaboration, which could result in an interesting self-distributed release for fans. The collaboration was much more successful than expected and [[Strays Don't Sleep]] was formed with [[Neilson Hubbard]], Brian Bequette, Billy Mercer, and Steve Latanation.\n\nIn the Autumn 2005 Strays Don't Sleep's debut self-titled album was released in the UK on [[One Little Indian Records]]. The release includes a DVD of [[Short subject|short films]] that were directed and shot by professional filmmakers and friends, including [[Gorman Bechard]], The Barnes Brothers, Martin Glenn, Matt Boyd and Jared Johnson. Matthew Ryan and [[Neilson Hubbard]] also directed three of the short films with the help of Nashville film student, [[Matt Riddlehoover]]. A [[Surround sound|5.1 surround sound]] mix of the entire record and films, by Paul PDub Walton of [[Bj\u00f6rk]] and [[Sneaker Pimps]] fame, is available on the DVD.\n\n''[[Strays Don't Sleep]]'' was released to great reviews from [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]], ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', [[The Sunday Express]] and ''[[The Times]]''. The success helped secure a US release, which was helped further by a placement in the hit CW (former WB) drama ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''. \"For Blue Skies\", a song concerning the sentencing of Matthew Ryan's brother to 30 years in prison, was made available on the [[One Tree Hill Soundtracks]]. Strays Don't Sleep toured the UK with Josh Rouse to support the album. Strays Don't Sleep was officially disbanded mid-2006. Their Music Video DVD Album \"Strays Don't Sleep\" with each song presented by a different director, won the top Award \u2013 The Grand Remi for Best Music Video \u2013 at the 2006 WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival in April 2006. The group performed in person at the Remi Awards Gala dinner for 500 international filmmakers to a standing ovation. They disbanded shortly after this remarkable performance.\n\n===2006 - ''From a Late Night High Rise''===\nIn 2006 Ryan completed recording for another [[solo album]] called ''[[From a Late Night Highrise|From a Late Night High Rise]]''. It's a collection of songs inspired by the death of a friend and the sentencing of Ryan's brother to 30 years in prison. The album featured band members from [[Strays Don't Sleep]] and was self-produced with [[Neilson Hubbard]]. ''[[From a Late Night Highrise|From a Late Night High Rise]]'' was released on December 5, 2006 through ''2minutes59'' and [[iTunes]], and Ryan embarked on a US tour with [[Tim Easton]] in February 2007. ''[[From a Late Night Highrise|From a Late Night High Rise]]'' was met with the strongest wave of critical support Ryan has received to date. It was praised as \"A must-hear, have-to-own epic of an album that should be required listening for every songwriter\u2014and music lover\u2014in the world.\"<ref>[http://www.pulsetc.com/article.php?sid=2852 Pulse of the Twin Cities \u2013 Locally Grown Alternative Newspaper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===2008 - ''Matthew Ryan vs. The Silver State''===\nIn 2008 Ryan released his next album: ''[[Matthew Ryan vs. The Silver State]]'' (or \"MRVSS\") on 00:02:59 and [[One Little Indian Records]]. Exclusive internet-only downloads of the album also included the song \"[[Rainy Night in Soho]]\" (a cover version of a song by [[The Pogues]]). Following the release of the album, Ryan toured the US to support its release with a full band.\n\n===2009 - ''Dear Lover''===\n''[[Dear Lover (album)|Dear Lover]]'', Matthew Ryan's next studio album, was released in October 2009. Followed in May 2010 by a stripped down version of the album: ''Dear Lover (The Acoustic Version)''.\n\n===2011 - ''I Recall Standing As Though Nothing Could Fall''===\nIn June 2010 he started recording ''I Recall Standing As Though Nothing Could Fall'' in his Nashville home studio, which he wouldn't finish until April 2011.<ref>http://matthewryan.bandcamp.com/album/i-recall-standing-as-though-nothing-could-fall</ref> In between he did an Italian tour in October 2010 to promote ''[[Dear Lover (album)|Dear Lover]]''.\n\n===2012 - ''In The Dusk of Everything''===\nIn the early winter of 2011 he started writing for his next album after moving from Nashville, TN to a town just outside Pittsburgh, PA (the state where he was born!). ''In The Dusk of Everything'' was recorded and mixed between April and July 2012 and released on October 30, 2012.  He made the record with the help of [[David Ricketts]], the producer of his first album, ''[[May Day (Matthew Ryan album)|May Day]]''.<ref>http://matthewryanonline.bandcamp.com/album/in-the-dusk-of-everything</ref>\n\n===2014 - ''An Anthem for the Broken''===\nOn February 26, 2014, Ryan released the first single, [https://johnandersonbenefit.bandcamp.com/album/an-anthem-for-the-broken-a-single-to-benefit-john-anderson An Anthem for the Broken], from his yet-to-be-released album, contributing 100% of the proceeds to his friend John Anderson, who was fighting [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. The track features Brian Bequette on bass guitar, [[Brian Fallon]] and [[Kevin Salem]] on electric guitar, and Joe Magistro on drums.\n\n===2014 - ''Boxers''===\n\nAfter almost walking away from music, Ryan released Boxers in October 2014. This marked his return to recording with a full backing band. A new friendship with Brian Fallon reignited Ryan\u2019s love of performing with a \u201cgang\u201d and brought him back to his love of creating music.\n\n===2017 - ''Hustle Up Starlings''===\n\nReleased in May 2017 Hustle Up Starlings was produced by Brian Fallon from The Gaslight Anthem.

Drawing on such influences like [[John Cougar Mellencamp]], Ryan showed a lot of potential on his debut album. [[Allmusic]] concluded, \"''The native of Chester, PA (near Philadelphia) was 25 at the time, but this is such a mature, emotionally honest effort that one got the impression he'd done more living than usual during his 25 years. Ryan's voice is rough and has a very lived-in quality that proves most appropriate on such tales of loss, disappointment, and hurt as \"Watch Your Step,\" \"Chrome,\" and \"Lights of the Commodore Barry.\" There isn't a lot of hope or optimism here; Ryan obviously didn't hesitate to let some of his darker feelings flow when he went into the studio to record this album, which is as pessimistic as it is soulful, moving and personal.''\"<ref name=\"AllMusicBiography2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/may-day-mw0000027686 | title=AllMusic Review by Alex Henderson | publisher=[[All Music]] | accessdate=July 19, 2015 | author=Henderson, Alex}}</ref> A video was made for \"Guilty\".

The material was stark and bare, ''[[Concussion (album)|Concussion]]'' was recorded and mixed in 8 days with Richard McLaurin. It was released in 2001 on [[Nashville, Tennessee]] label ''WaxySilver'' and features a duet with [[Lucinda Williams]]. Ryan was asked by actor/director [[Edward Burns]] to contribute a song to his film ''[[Ash Wednesday]]''. \"[[Be Thou My Vision]]\" was used on the [[closing credits]] of the film. Ryan opened tours for Kasey Chambers and Lucinda Williams for much of 2001, along with his own headlining shows.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n2002 was a quiet period for Ryan, eventually releasing two collections of [[Stereo-Pak]] [[Demo (music)|demo recordings]], ''[[Dissent from the Living Room]]'' and ''[[Hopeless to Hopeful]]''. These were made available on CDR through Ryan's website.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n===2003 - ''Regret Over the Wires''===\nRyan started recording again in February 2003, ''[[Regret Over the Wires]]'' was released in late 2003 by [[Hybrid Recordings]]. In April, ''[[Concussion (album)|Concussion]]'' was released in the UK and Europe through [[One Little Indian Records]]. This included a UK tour with label mate [[Jeff Klein]]. On September 9, 2003, [[One Little Indian Records]] also released ''[[Happiness (Matthew Ryan album)|Happiness]]'' in the UK and Europe only, a collection of songs taken from Ryan's self-distributed collections ''Dissent from the Living Room'' and ''Hopeless to Hopeful''. Ryan made another self-distributed release in December entitled ''[[These Are Field Recordings]]'', a two-disc collection of live recordings and early tracks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n===2006- Strays Don't Sleep===\n\n{{Main|Strays Don't Sleep}}\n\nMatthew Ryan approached [[Neilson Hubbard]] in 2004 about a collaboration, which could result in an interesting self-distributed release for fans. The collaboration was much more successful than expected and [[Strays Don't Sleep]] was formed with [[Neilson Hubbard]], Brian Bequette, Billy Mercer, and Steve Latanation.\n\nIn the Autumn 2005 Strays Don't Sleep's debut self-titled album was released in the UK on [[One Little Indian Records]]. The release includes a DVD of [[Short subject|short films]] that were directed and shot by professional filmmakers and friends, including [[Gorman Bechard]], The Barnes Brothers, Martin Glenn, Matt Boyd and Jared Johnson. Matthew Ryan and [[Neilson Hubbard]] also directed three of the short films with the help of Nashville film student, [[Matt Riddlehoover]]. A [[Surround sound|5.1 surround sound]] mix of the entire record and films, by Paul PDub Walton of [[Bj\u00f6rk]] and [[Sneaker Pimps]] fame, is available on the DVD.\n\n''[[Strays Don't Sleep]]'' was released to great reviews from [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]], ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', [[The Sunday Express]] and ''[[The Times]]''. The success helped secure a US release, which was helped further by a placement in the hit CW (former WB) drama ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''. \"For Blue Skies\", a song concerning the sentencing of Matthew Ryan's brother to 30 years in prison, was made available on the [[One Tree Hill Soundtracks]]. Strays Don't Sleep toured the UK with Josh Rouse to support the album. Strays Don't Sleep was officially disbanded mid-2006. Their Music Video DVD Album \"Strays Don't Sleep\" with each song presented by a different director, won the top Award \u2013 The Grand Remi for Best Music Video \u2013 at the 2006 WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival in April 2006. The group performed in person at the Remi Awards Gala dinner for 500 international filmmakers to a standing ovation. They disbanded shortly after this remarkable performance.\n\n===2006 - ''From a Late Night High Rise''===\nIn 2006 Ryan completed recording for another [[solo album]] called ''[[From a Late Night Highrise|From a Late Night High Rise]]''. It's a collection of songs inspired by the death of a friend and the sentencing of Ryan's brother to 30 years in prison. The album featured band members from [[Strays Don't Sleep]] and was self-produced with [[Neilson Hubbard]]. ''[[From a Late Night Highrise|From a Late Night High Rise]]'' was released on December 5, 2006 through ''2minutes59'' and [[iTunes]], and Ryan embarked on a US tour with [[Tim Easton]] in February 2007. ''[[From a Late Night Highrise|From a Late Night High Rise]]'' was met with the strongest wave of critical support Ryan has received to date. It was praised as \"A must-hear, have-to-own epic of an album that should be required listening for every songwriter\u2014and music lover\u2014in the world.\"<ref>[http://www.pulsetc.com/article.php?sid=2852 Pulse of the Twin Cities \u2013 Locally Grown Alternative Newspaper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===2008 - ''Matthew Ryan vs. The Silver State''===\nIn 2008 Ryan released his next album: ''[[Matthew Ryan vs. The Silver State]]'' (or \"MRVSS\") on 00:02:59 and [[One Little Indian Records]].

He made the record with the help of [[David Ricketts]], the producer of his first album, ''[[May Day (Matthew Ryan album)|May Day]]''.<ref>http://matthewryanonline.bandcamp.com/album/in-the-dusk-of-everything</ref>\n\n===2014 - ''An Anthem for the Broken''===\nOn February 26, 2014, Ryan released the first single, [https://johnandersonbenefit.bandcamp.com/album/an-anthem-for-the-broken-a-single-to-benefit-john-anderson An Anthem for the Broken], from his yet-to-be-released album, contributing 100% of the proceeds to his friend John Anderson, who was fighting [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. The track features Brian Bequette on bass guitar, [[Brian Fallon]] and [[Kevin Salem]] on electric guitar, and Joe Magistro on drums.\n\n===2014 - ''Boxers''===\n\nAfter almost walking away from music, Ryan released Boxers in October 2014. This marked his return to recording with a full backing band. A new friendship with Brian Fallon reignited Ryan\u2019s love of performing with a \u201cgang\u201d and brought him back to his love of creating music.\n\n===2017 - ''Hustle Up Starlings''===\n\nReleased in May 2017 Hustle Up Starlings was produced by Brian Fallon from The Gaslight Anthem.
