He never met his father, who was killed in action, while served as sergeant with the [[British Army]] during the [[battle of the Somme]] on July 1, 1916. His mother Florence joined newly established [[Women's Royal Air Force (World War I)|Women's Royal Air Force]] and young Ronald grew up with the relatives.<ref name=\"Ronald R.

She fell in love with him, but due to end of the War, Antonius sailed back to the United States. Florence maintained correspondence with him for almost next two years and finally took young Ronald and left for United States in the spring of 1920.<ref name=\"Kentucky Humanities\" /><ref name=\"The Sentinel\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sentinelnews.com/content/van-stockum-early-years-centenarian-part-1-recalling-past-100-years-or-so|title= The Early years of a Centenarian: Recalling the past 100 years or so |publisher=The Sentinel News|location= Shelbyville, Kentucky |date= July 25, 2018|accessdate=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n\nBecause his mother Florence was not a U.S. citizen, she was denied entry to the United States. The only obvious solution of the problem was marriage with Antonius. They were married on May 20, 1920 and Florence and infant Ronald were allowed to entry into the United States. Ronald was also adopted by Antonius and renamed Van Stockum.<ref name=\"The Sentinel\" />\n\nRonald grew up in Washington state and completed the grade school in [[Bellingham, Washington]]. He later graduated from the high school in [[Yakima, Washington]], and entered the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], where he graduated in June 1937 with [[bachelor's degree]]. During his time at the university, he completed the [[ROTC]] course and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. Also, he was active on the [[YMCA]] student board.<ref name=\"The Sentinel\" />\n\nFollowing his graduation, Van Stockum was commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on August 4, 1937, and ordered to [[the Basic School]] at [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] for Marine Corps Officer instruction. Van Stockum had the opportunity to work with great names in the modern Marine Corps history like, for example, [[Gilder D. Jackson Jr.]], [[Chesty Puller]], [[Leonard B. Cresswell]], [[Frank B. Goettge]], [[Russell N. Jordahl]], [[Walfried M. Fromhold]], [[Howard N. Kenyon]] and [[Roy M. Gulick]], who served as instructors during his time at the school. At the end of instruction, Van Stockum received the highest marks in Drill and Command.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n[[File:2dLt Ronald R. Van Stockum.jpg|left|thumb|Van Stockum as a 2nd Lieutenant in June 1939.]]\nHe completed the school at the end of May 1938 and travelled to the West Coast. Van Stockum subsequently completed Secondary Battery Gunnery School on board [[USS Nevada (BB-36)|USS ''Nevada'']] and then joined the Marine detachment aboard the battleship [[USS Tennessee (BB-43)|USS ''Tennessee'']], anchored off [[San Pedro, California]]. which was subsequently ordered to New York through the [[Panama Canal]] for participation in [[Fleet Problem XX]] and \u201cshowing the flag\u201d at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|World's Fair of 1939]].<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nAfter one year of sea duties, Van Stockum was ordered to [[San Diego]] in mid-May 1939 and attached to the [[1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment]] under Lieutenant Colonel [[Oliver P. Smith]]. He remained with that unit until January 1941 and then was ordered again for sea duties as a member of the Marine detachment aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|USS ''Wasp'']]. He subsequently participated in the [[Neutrality patrol]]s in the stretch between [[Bermuda]] and [[Hampton Roads]] and following the United States entry into World War II, Van Stockum was promoted to the rank of captain in February 1942 and succeeded Captain [[August Larson]] in command of the detachment aboard. He then participated in the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|relief of Malta]], when ''Wasp'' delivered two sets of 47 [[Spitfire]]s fighter planes within the Operations  [[Operation Calendar|Calendar]] and [[Operation Bowery|Bowery]] in April and May 1942.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" />\n\nVan Stockum was then transferred from the ''Wasp'' and was assigned to [[Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], where, having been promoted to the rank of Major, he formed the Heavy Weapons Company, Company D, [[21st Marine Regiment (United States)|1st Battalion, 21st Marines]] under lieutenant colonel Ernest W. Fry Jr. The ''Wasp'' left for the Southwest Pacific shortly thereafter and was sunk off [[Guadalcanal]] on September 15, 1942. His relief, Captain John Kennedy, was lost in the sinking.\n\nHis battalion was ordered to [[San Diego]], [[California]] in July 1942 and Van Stockum assumed duty as battalion's executive officer. His unit was ordered to the Pacific Area in early 1943 and arrived to [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] on February 20. Van Stockum participated in the intensive training on [[Guadalcanal]] until November 1943, when he sailed for forthcoming campaign \u2013 [[Bougainville Island]], [[North Solomon Islands]].<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" />\n\nVan Stockum participated in the amphibious landing on [[Cape Torokina]] on November 6 and spent almost two months in rain and mud conditions. He also took part in the [[Battle of Hellzapoppin Ridge and Hill 600A|battle of Hellzapoppin Ridge]] at the beginning of December 1943 and except the several front-line inspections, he spent an night in a foxhole. Van Stockum later assumed additional responsibility as commander of Battalion's [[Weapons company]] and remained on Bougainville until January 9, 1944, when 21st Regiment was ordered back to Guadalcanal. Van Stockum was decorated with the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with [[\"V\" Device|Combat \"V\"]] for his service on Bougainville.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" /><ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nFollowing the period of training, Van Stockum sailed with 1st Battalion to Guam on July 21, 1944, and went ashore with first waves of troops on Asan Beach. During a vicious Japanese counter attack the night of July 25-26, he proceeded alone to the front lines located at the top of a cliff. Here he reported by radio that the front lines had held even though the Japanese had infiltrated and passed down the valleys to attack the rear installations.\n\nAfter this campaign, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and assumed command of [[1st Battalion, 3rd Marines]] under Colonel [[James A. Stuart]]. He subsequently spent several months on Guam with mopping-up operations against scattered Japanese soldiers. His battalion was scheduled to take part in the [[battle of Iwo Jima]] in February 1945, but remained in floating reserve and did not go ashore.<ref name=\"Ronald R.

Pickett]]. He was engaged in training of Army and Marine units in Amphibious Operations until January 1947, when he was ordered to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], for duty as Inspector-Instructor with 4th Marine Reserve Infantry Battalion.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" /><ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\n===Incident in Minneapolis===\n\nThe Inspector-Instructor, a regular officer with a small staff, provided administrative and logistic support to a reserve unit composed of officers and men who came on duty a weekend a month for training.  The commanding officer was a reserve officer, actually in command of the unit, who actually relied heavily on the advice of his regular counterpart. This assignment in Minneapolis later showed as crucial in his career. Van Stockum had conflict with the reserve Colonel, a commanding officer of the battalion who had a drinking problem. Van Stockum reported this incident to the director of marine reserve district, Colonel [[Walker A. Reaves]], who requested official investigation. The Inspector general, Brigadier General [[Robert Blake (USMC)|Robert Blake]], sent Colonel [[James M. Masters Sr.]], who found Van Stockum's complaint legitimate and relieved reserve Colonel of his command. He was also supported in a private letter from the director, [[Marine Corps Reserve]], Brigadier General [[William T. Clement]]. This whole incident will be reflected later during his promotion to the general's rank.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\n===1947\u20131962===\n\nVan Stockum was transferred to the same position with reserve battalion in [[New York City]] in June 1948 and remained in that command for one year.

He never met his father, who was killed in action, while served as sergeant with the [[British Army]] during the [[battle of the Somme]] on July 1, 1916. His mother Florence joined newly established [[Women's Royal Air Force (World War I)|Women's Royal Air Force]] and young Ronald grew up with the relatives.<ref name=\"Ronald R.

She fell in love with him, but due to end of the War, Antonius sailed back to the United States. Florence maintained correspondence with him for almost next two years and finally took young Ronald and left for United States in the spring of 1920.<ref name=\"Kentucky Humanities\" /><ref name=\"The Sentinel\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sentinelnews.com/content/van-stockum-early-years-centenarian-part-1-recalling-past-100-years-or-so|title= The Early years of a Centenarian: Recalling the past 100 years or so |publisher=The Sentinel News|location= Shelbyville, Kentucky |date= July 25, 2018|accessdate=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n\nBecause his mother Florence was not a U.S. citizen, she was denied entry to the United States. The only obvious solution of the problem was marriage with Antonius. They were married on May 20, 1920 and Florence and infant Ronald were allowed to entry into the United States. Ronald was also adopted by Antonius and renamed Van Stockum.<ref name=\"The Sentinel\" />\n\nRonald grew up in Washington state and completed the grade school in [[Bellingham, Washington]]. He later graduated from the high school in [[Yakima, Washington]], and entered the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], where he graduated in June 1937 with [[bachelor's degree]]. During his time at the university, he completed the [[ROTC]] course and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. Also, he was active on the [[YMCA]] student board.<ref name=\"The Sentinel\" />\n\nFollowing his graduation, Van Stockum was commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on August 4, 1937, and ordered to [[the Basic School]] at [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] for Marine Corps Officer instruction. Van Stockum had the opportunity to work with great names in the modern Marine Corps history like, for example, [[Gilder D. Jackson Jr.]], [[Chesty Puller]], [[Leonard B. Cresswell]], [[Frank B. Goettge]], [[Russell N. Jordahl]], [[Walfried M. Fromhold]], [[Howard N. Kenyon]] and [[Roy M. Gulick]], who served as instructors during his time at the school. At the end of instruction, Van Stockum received the highest marks in Drill and Command.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n[[File:2dLt Ronald R. Van Stockum.jpg|left|thumb|Van Stockum as a 2nd Lieutenant in June 1939.]]\nHe completed the school at the end of May 1938 and travelled to the West Coast. Van Stockum subsequently completed Secondary Battery Gunnery School on board [[USS Nevada (BB-36)|USS ''Nevada'']] and then joined the Marine detachment aboard the battleship [[USS Tennessee (BB-43)|USS ''Tennessee'']], anchored off [[San Pedro, California]]. which was subsequently ordered to New York through the [[Panama Canal]] for participation in [[Fleet Problem XX]] and \u201cshowing the flag\u201d at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|World's Fair of 1939]].<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nAfter one year of sea duties, Van Stockum was ordered to [[San Diego]] in mid-May 1939 and attached to the [[1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment]] under Lieutenant Colonel [[Oliver P. Smith]]. He remained with that unit until January 1941 and then was ordered again for sea duties as a member of the Marine detachment aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|USS ''Wasp'']]. He subsequently participated in the [[Neutrality patrol]]s in the stretch between [[Bermuda]] and [[Hampton Roads]] and following the United States entry into World War II, Van Stockum was promoted to the rank of captain in February 1942 and succeeded Captain [[August Larson]] in command of the detachment aboard. He then participated in the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|relief of Malta]], when ''Wasp'' delivered two sets of 47 [[Spitfire]]s fighter planes within the Operations  [[Operation Calendar|Calendar]] and [[Operation Bowery|Bowery]] in April and May 1942.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" />\n\nVan Stockum was then transferred from the ''Wasp'' and was assigned to [[Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], where, having been promoted to the rank of Major, he formed the Heavy Weapons Company, Company D, [[21st Marine Regiment (United States)|1st Battalion, 21st Marines]] under lieutenant colonel Ernest W. Fry Jr. The ''Wasp'' left for the Southwest Pacific shortly thereafter and was sunk off [[Guadalcanal]] on September 15, 1942. His relief, Captain John Kennedy, was lost in the sinking.\n\nHis battalion was ordered to [[San Diego]], [[California]] in July 1942 and Van Stockum assumed duty as battalion's executive officer. His unit was ordered to the Pacific Area in early 1943 and arrived to [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] on February 20. Van Stockum participated in the intensive training on [[Guadalcanal]] until November 1943, when he sailed for forthcoming campaign \u2013 [[Bougainville Island]], [[North Solomon Islands]].<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" />\n\nVan Stockum participated in the amphibious landing on [[Cape Torokina]] on November 6 and spent almost two months in rain and mud conditions. He also took part in the [[Battle of Hellzapoppin Ridge and Hill 600A|battle of Hellzapoppin Ridge]] at the beginning of December 1943 and except the several front-line inspections, he spent an night in a foxhole. Van Stockum later assumed additional responsibility as commander of Battalion's [[Weapons company]] and remained on Bougainville until January 9, 1944, when 21st Regiment was ordered back to Guadalcanal. Van Stockum was decorated with the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with [[\"V\" Device|Combat \"V\"]] for his service on Bougainville.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" /><ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nFollowing the period of training, Van Stockum sailed with 1st Battalion to Guam on July 21, 1944, and went ashore with first waves of troops on Asan Beach. During a vicious Japanese counter attack the night of July 25-26, he proceeded alone to the front lines located at the top of a cliff. Here he reported by radio that the front lines had held even though the Japanese had infiltrated and passed down the valleys to attack the rear installations.\n\nAfter this campaign, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and assumed command of [[1st Battalion, 3rd Marines]] under Colonel [[James A. Stuart]]. He subsequently spent several months on Guam with mopping-up operations against scattered Japanese soldiers. His battalion was scheduled to take part in the [[battle of Iwo Jima]] in February 1945, but remained in floating reserve and did not go ashore.<ref name=\"Ronald R.

Pickett]]. He was engaged in training of Army and Marine units in Amphibious Operations until January 1947, when he was ordered to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], for duty as Inspector-Instructor with 4th Marine Reserve Infantry Battalion.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Papers - USMC Military History Division\" /><ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\n===Incident in Minneapolis===\n\nThe Inspector-Instructor, a regular officer with a small staff, provided administrative and logistic support to a reserve unit composed of officers and men who came on duty a weekend a month for training.  The commanding officer was a reserve officer, actually in command of the unit, who actually relied heavily on the advice of his regular counterpart. This assignment in Minneapolis later showed as crucial in his career. Van Stockum had conflict with the reserve Colonel, a commanding officer of the battalion who had a drinking problem. Van Stockum reported this incident to the director of marine reserve district, Colonel [[Walker A. Reaves]], who requested official investigation. The Inspector general, Brigadier General [[Robert Blake (USMC)|Robert Blake]], sent Colonel [[James M. Masters Sr.]], who found Van Stockum's complaint legitimate and relieved reserve Colonel of his command. He was also supported in a private letter from the director, [[Marine Corps Reserve]], Brigadier General [[William T. Clement]]. This whole incident will be reflected later during his promotion to the general's rank.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\n===1947\u20131962===\n\nVan Stockum was transferred to the same position with reserve battalion in [[New York City]] in June 1948 and remained in that command for one year.

His tour of duty with 2nd Marine Division continued when Van Stockum assumed command of [[8th Marine Regiment (United States)|8th Marine Regiment]] at the beginning of July 1959.<ref name=\"Ronald R. Van Stockum Journal\" />\n\nA new divisional commander, Major General [[James P. Berkeley]], appointed Van Stockum as Divisional Inspector in June 1960. As Division Inspector Van Stockum had the responsibility of scheduling inspections, conducting inspections personally, and accompanying the Commanding general (CG) on his inspections. He also processed disciplinary matters for action by the CG, interviewing personnel who were requesting personal interviews with the CG, etc. Van Stockum had also some difficulties with the commanding officer of the 6th Marines, Colonel [[Melvin D.

In addition, he formed a team with [[Tommy Rich]] as \"Fargo's Fabulous Ones\", an attempt by Mid-Southern (Memphis) to bury and still cash in on the fame attained by the previous incarnation of the [[Fabulous Ones]], [[Steve Keirn]] and [[Stan Lane]], who walked out of the territory after a dispute. They held the AWA Southern Tag Team titles in 1984 until dropping them to Phil Hickerson and the Spoiler (Frank Morrell). The duo would break up soon after, with Gilbert turning heel. The two had a brief but intense feud, which memorably began on television when the two were presented with a \"Tag Team of the Year\" award by announcer [[Lance Russell]] and two guests. Gilbert, unaware his former partner was at the taping, badmouthed Rich, then the International Heavyweight Champion, until Rich came out to confront him. Rich immediately got the upper hand, running Gibert into the steel ringpost several times, bloodying him in the process before the cameras went to a commercial. After the commercial break, Gilbert told Russell he wanted Rich to come back out so he could apologize to him in person, stating he was wrong for still being bitter about the break-up of the team, and was fueled by jealousy of Rich's championship title reign and new found star status. When Rich accepted Gilbert's apology, Gilbert suddenly turned on him and, in front of a stunned audience and a speechless Russell, rammed Rich's head into the ringpost, just as Rich had done to him moments earlier. Gilbert then made his way to Bill Watts' Mid-South territory.\n\n===Universal Wrestling Federation (1986-1987)===\nIn 1986, Gilbert went to work for Bill Watts at [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], Eddie added the \"Hot Stuff\" to his name. He started a heel stable of wrestlers called \"Hot Stuff International, Inc.\" and he managed it and wrestled. His stable included [[Steve Borden|Sting]], [[Jim Hellwig|Ultimate Warrior]] and [[Rick Steiner]] before they were stars. He was always a ladies' man and he stole [[Missy Hyatt]] from [[John Tatum (wrestler)|John Tatum]] in 1987, with his stable being renamed \"H & H International, Inc.\" He married Hyatt in 1988. [[Iceman Parsons]] and [[Dick Murdoch]] would also join his stable later on at different times as well. Sting would eventually leave \"Hot Stuff International, Inc.\" and feud with them.\n\nEddie also worked as a booker, who came up with the famous ''Battle of New Orleans'' angle in late-1987 involving Chris Adams, Terry Taylor, Sting, and himself.  Following a match in which Taylor defeated [[Shane Douglas]] due to interference by both Gilbert and [[Rick Steiner]], Adams told referee [[Randy Anderson]] of the interference.  As Adams pleaded his case with Anderson, Gilbert and Taylor attacked him, and Sting eventually evened the sides.  The angle eventually spilled outside the ring into the stands, and near the concession area, featuring a huge brawl involving beer kegs, chairs, trash cans, tables, popcorn machines and other objects. Gilbert was awarded [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Best Booker|Best Booker of 1988]] by the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]''. He would stay with the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] until the Purchase from [[Jim Crockett Promotions]]\n\n===Continental Wrestling Federation (1988)===\nFrom there, Gilbert worked in Alabama's [[Continental Wrestling Federation]] (CWF), where he reformed Hot Stuff Inc.

This conference issued the \"Bamenda Declaration\", which stated that if the federal state was not restored within a reasonable time, Southern Cameroons would declare its independence. The AAC was renamed the Southern Cameroons Peoples Conference (SCPC), and later the Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation (SCAPO), with the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]] (SCNC) as the executive governing body. Younger activists formed the Southern Cameroons Youth League (SCYL) in Buea on 28 May 1995.

While some movements (such as [[Bakassi Movement for Self-Determination|BAMOSD]]) sought to make Bakassi an independent state, others came to tie their cause to that of Ambazonia. In November 2007, the \"Liberators of the Southern Cameroon People\", a previously unknown group, killed 21 Cameroonian soldiers. Most militias in Bakassi laid down their arms in September 2009.<ref name=\"bakassi\">[https://www.refworld.org/docid/4cf4dafc2.html Cameroon Rebels Threaten Security in Oil-Rich Gulf of Guinea] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329001435/https://www.refworld.org/docid/4cf4dafc2.html |date=2019-03-29 }}, Ref World, Nov 24, 2010.

However, the English-speaking peoples of the Southern Cameroons did not believe that they were fairly treated by the French-speaking government of the country. Then-president [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] feared that Southern Cameroons would secede from the union, taking its natural resources with it. Following a French Cameroon [[Cameroonian constitutional referendum, 1972|unilateral referendum]] on 20 May 1972, a new constitution was adopted in Cameroon which replaced the [[Federal republic|federal]] state with a [[unitary state]], and also gave more power to the president.<ref>[http://africanelections.tripod.com/cm.html Elections in Cameroon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903053954/http://africanelections.tripod.com/cm.html |date=2011-09-03 }} African Elections Database</ref> Southern Cameroons lost its autonomous status and became the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest Region]] and the [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest Region]] of the Republic of Cameroon.

The conference issued the \"Buea Declaration\", which called for constitutional amendments to restore the 1961 federation. This was followed by the second All Anglophone Conference (AAC2) in [[Bamenda]] in 1994. This conference issued the \"Bamenda Declaration\", which stated that if the federal state was not restored within a reasonable time, Southern Cameroons would declare its independence. The AAC was renamed the Southern Cameroons Peoples Conference (SCPC), and later the Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation (SCAPO), with the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]] (SCNC) as the executive governing body. Younger activists formed the Southern Cameroons Youth League (SCYL) in Buea on 28 May 1995. The SCNC sent a delegation, led by John Foncha, to the United Nations, which was received on 1 June 1995 and presented a petition against the 'annexation' of the Southern Cameroons by French Cameroon.
