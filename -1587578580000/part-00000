(see [[:de:Am Hohen Ufer]]; in German).\n\nWhile it is likely that the name \"Dresden\" derived from [[Dresden]] in Germany, it has also been suggested that it could derive directly from the old [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] word ''drezg'' (\"forest\") or ''Drezd'ane'', for an inhabitant of a forest.<ref>The settlers in the riverside forest, an appellation fully compatible with that of the early inhabitants of the Hanover Plain.</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Nov1997/HoefnagelClose.html| title=Dresden: What Is in the Name| author=Dick Hoefnagel and Virginia L.

Hennessey. On the New Hampshire Executive Council, Hanover is in the 1st District and is represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Michael J. Cryans]]. In the United States House of Representatives, Hanover is a part of [[New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district]] and is currently represented by Democrat [[Ann McLane Kuster]].\n\nLike most other college towns, Hanover is a liberal bastion and a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections. No Republican presidential nominee has managed to receive over 32 percent of the vote in the town in the past two decades. Hanover backed [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] with 85 percent of the vote in 2016, providing the former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[U.S. Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] with her largest margin of victory in the state of New Hampshire, which she narrowly won by 2,736 votes statewide. Her margin of victory in Hanover was by over twice that amount, allowing attribution that her margin in Hanover was what ultimately allowed her to carry the Granite State. However, Hanover did not back Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary (supporting [[Barack Obama]] with 58.15 percent of the vote to Clinton's 26.11 percent) nor did it support her in the 2016 Democratic primary when voters opted for [[U.S. Senator]] [[Bernie Sanders]] from neighboring [[Vermont]] with 53.04 percent of the vote.\n\n\nHanover: Hospital (TV Series)\n\nPremiere: Sep 26, 1999\n\nFinale: Dec 12, 2000\n\n\nUPN\n\nSeason One: September 26, 1999 - April 16, 2000 25 Episodes\n\nSeason Two: September 12, 2000 - December 12, 2000 14 Episodes\n\n==Education==\n[[Image:A Front View of Dartmouth College (1793).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students playing [[cricket (game)|cricket]] at Dartmouth College in 1793]]\n;Public schools\n* [[Hanover High School (New Hampshire)|Hanover High School]]\n* Frances C.

Hennessey. On the New Hampshire Executive Council, Hanover is in the 1st District and is represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Michael J. Cryans]]. In the United States House of Representatives, Hanover is a part of [[New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district]] and is currently represented by Democrat [[Ann McLane Kuster]].\n\nLike most other college towns, Hanover is a liberal bastion and a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections. No Republican presidential nominee has managed to receive over 32 percent of the vote in the town in the past two decades. Hanover backed [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] with 85 percent of the vote in 2016, providing the former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[U.S. Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] with her largest margin of victory in the state of New Hampshire, which she narrowly won by 2,736 votes statewide. Her margin of victory in Hanover was by over twice that amount, allowing attribution that her margin in Hanover was what ultimately allowed her to carry the Granite State. However, Hanover did not back Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary (supporting [[Barack Obama]] with 58.15 percent of the vote to Clinton's 26.11 percent) nor did it support her in the 2016 Democratic primary when voters opted for [[U.S. Senator]] [[Bernie Sanders]] from neighboring [[Vermont]] with 53.04 percent of the vote.\n\n==Education==\n[[Image:A Front View of Dartmouth College (1793).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students playing [[cricket (game)|cricket]] at Dartmouth College in 1793]]\n;Public schools\n* [[Hanover High School (New Hampshire)|Hanover High School]]\n* Frances C.

She was the longest passenger ship in the world from 1845 to 1854. She was designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (1806\u20131859), for the [[Great Western Steamship Company]]'s [[transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] service between [[Bristol]] and [[New York City|New York]]. While other ships had been built of iron or equipped with a [[Propeller (marine)|screw propeller]], ''Great Britain'' was the first to combine these features in a large ocean-going ship. She was the first iron steamer to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], which she did in 1845, in the time of 14 days.\n\nThe ship is {{convert|322|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length and has a 3,400-ton displacement. She was powered by two inclined 2 cylinder engines of the [[marine steam engine#Direct acting|direct-acting]] type, with twin high pressure cylinders (diameter uncertain) and twin low pressure cylinders {{convert|88|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[bore (engine)|bore]], all of {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]]. She was also provided with secondary masts for sail power. The four decks provided accommodation for a crew of 120, plus 360 passengers who were provided with cabins, and dining and promenade saloons.\n\nWhen launched in 1843, ''Great Britain'' was by far the largest vessel afloat. But her protracted construction time of six years (1839\u20131845) and high cost had left her owners in a difficult financial position, and they were forced out of business in 1846, having spent all their remaining funds refloating the ship after she ran aground at [[Dundrum, County Down#History|Dundrum Bay]] in [[County Down, Northern Ireland|County Down]] near [[Newcastle, Northern Ireland|Newcastle]] in what is now [[Northern Ireland]], after a [[navigation]] error. In 1852 she was sold for [[marine salvage|salvage]] and repaired. ''Great Britain'' later carried thousands of [[Immigration to Australia|immigrants to Australia]] from 1852 until being converted to all-sail in 1881. Three years later, she was retired to the [[Falkland Islands]], where she was used as a warehouse, quarantine ship and [[hulk (ship)|coal hulk]] until she was [[scuttling|scuttled]] and sunk in 1937, 98 years since being [[keel laying|laid down]] at the start of her construction.{{sfn|Gibbs1957|pp=41\u201354}}\n\nIn 1970, after ''Great Britain'' had lain under water and abandoned for 33 years, Sir [[Jack Hayward|Jack Arnold Hayward]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1923\u20132015) paid for the vessel to be raised and repaired enough to be towed north through the Atlantic back to the United Kingdom, and returned to the Bristol [[dry dock]] where she had been built 127 years earlier. Hayward was a prominent businessman, developer, philanthropist and owner of the English football club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Now listed as part of the [[National Historic Fleet]], ''Great Britain'' is a visitor attraction and museum ship in [[Bristol Harbour]], with between 150,000 and 200,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Great Western maiden voyage.jpg|thumb|left|The {{SS|Great Western}} on her maiden voyage]]\nAfter the initial success of its first liner, {{SS|Great Western}} of 1838, the [[Great Western Steamship Company]] collected materials for a sister ship, tentatively named ''City of New York''.{{sfn|Gibbs1957|pp=41\u201354}} The same engineering team that had collaborated so successfully on ''Great Western''\u2014[[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Isambard Brunel]], Thomas Guppy, Christopher Claxton and [[William Patterson (engineer)|William Patterson]]\u2014was again assembled. This time however, Brunel, whose reputation was at its height, came to assert overall control over design of the ship\u2014a state of affairs that would have far-reaching consequences for the company. Construction was carried out in a specially adapted [[dry dock]] in [[Bristol]], England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunel200.com/ss_great_britain.htm |title=SS ''Great Britain'' |work=Brunel 200 |access-date=31 December 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514110144/http://www.brunel200.com/ss_great_britain.htm |archive-date=14 May 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Adoption of iron hull===\nTwo chance encounters were to profoundly affect the design of ''Great Britain''. In late 1838, [[John Laird (shipbuilder)|John Laird's]] {{convert|213|ft|m|adj=on}} [[English Channel]] [[packet ship]] ''Rainbow''\u2014the largest iron-[[hull (watercraft)|hulled]] ship then in service\u2014made a stop at Bristol. Brunel despatched his associates Christopher Claxton and William Patterson to make a return voyage to [[Antwerp]] on ''Rainbow'' to assess the utility of the new building material. Both men returned as converts to iron-hulled technology, and Brunel scrapped his plans to build a wooden ship and persuaded the company directors to build an iron-hulled ship.{{sfn|Fox|2003|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\n''Great Britain''{{'}}s builders recognised a number of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to [[dry rot]] or [[woodworm]], and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit on the length of a wooden-hulled ship is about 300&nbsp;feet, after which [[hogging and sagging|hogging]]\u2014the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it\u2014becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging, so that the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is much greater.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=144}} The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400&nbsp;tons, over 1,000&nbsp;tons larger than any ship then in existence.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=148}}\n\n===Adoption of screw propulsion===\n[[File:SS Archimedes by Huggins cropped.jpg|thumb|left | Artist's impression of {{SS|Archimedes||}}]]\n[[File:Great Britain propeller and rudder wideshot.jpg|thumb|Replica of ''Great Britain''{{'}}s original six-bladed propeller on the museum ship. This propeller proved totally unsatisfactory in service and was quickly replaced with a four-bladed model.]]\nIn early 1840, a second chance encounter occurred, the arrival of the revolutionary {{SS|Archimedes||}} at Bristol, the first [[propeller|screw-propelled]] steamship, completed only a few months before by [[Francis Pettit Smith|F. P. Smith's]] Propeller Steamship Company. Brunel had been looking into methods of improving the performance of ''Great Britain''{{'}}s [[paddlewheel]]s, and took an immediate interest in the new technology. Smith, sensing a prestigious new customer for his own company, agreed to lend ''Archimedes'' to Brunel for extended tests.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=148}} Over several months, Smith and Brunel tested a number of different propellers on ''Archimedes'' to find the most efficient design, a four-bladed model submitted by Smith.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=148, 151}}\n\nHaving satisfied himself as to the advantages of screw propulsion, Brunel wrote to the company directors to persuade them to embark on a second major design change, abandoning the paddlewheel engines\u2014already half constructed\u2014for completely new engines suitable for powering a propeller.\n\nBrunel listed the advantages of the screw propeller over the paddlewheel as follows:\n\n* Screw propulsion machinery was lighter in weight, thus improving fuel economy;\n* Screw propulsion machinery could be kept lower in the hull, lowering the ship's centre of gravity and making it more stable in heavy seas;\n* By taking up less room, propeller engines would allow more cargo to be carried;\n* Elimination of bulky paddle-boxes would lessen resistance through the water, and also allow the ship to manoeuvre more easily in confined waterways;\n* The depth of a paddlewheel is constantly changing, depending on the ship's cargo and the movement of waves, while a propeller stays fully submerged and at full efficiency at all times;\n* Screw propulsion machinery was cheaper.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=149}}\n\nBrunel's arguments proved persuasive, and in December 1840, the company agreed to adopt the new technology. The decision became a costly one, setting the ship's completion back by nine months.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=149}}\n\nReporting on the ship's arrival in New York, in its first issue ''[[Scientific American]]'' opined, \"If there is any thing objectionable in the construction or machinery of this noble ship, it is the mode of propelling her by the screw propeller; and we should not be surprised if it should be, ere long, superseded by paddle wheels at the sides.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v303/n2/box/scientificamerican0810-12_BX1.html |title=165 Years Ago, Happy Birthday to Us |journal=[[Scientific American]] |access-date=14 March 2015 |volume=303 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0810-12 |pages=12\u201313 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405104323/http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v303/n2/box/scientificamerican0810-12_BX1.html |archive-date= 5 April 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Launch==\n[[File:Launch-of-the-SS-GB.jpg|right|thumb|A painting of the launch in 1843]]\nThe launching or, more accurately, the [[float-out]] took place on 19 July 1843. Conditions were generally favourable and diarists recorded that, after a dull start, the weather brightened with only a few intermittent showers. The atmosphere of the day can best be gauged from a report the following day in ''The Bristol Mirror'':\n\n<blockquote>Large crowds started to gather early in the day including many people who had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle. There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed in a neat orderly formation down the entire length of the Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on the streets as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.<ref name=BM>{{cite news | title=Royal Visit| work=The Bristol Mirror| pages=1\u20132| date=20 July 1843| url= }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] arrived at 10 a.m. at the Great Western Railway terminus.

The Prince Consort, dressed as a private gentleman, was accompanied by his [[equerry]]-in-waiting, personal secretary, the [[Brownlow Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], and Lords [[James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe|Wharncliffe]], [[Charles Jenkinson, 3rd Earl of Liverpool|Liverpool]], [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle|Lincoln]] and [[Lord Charles Wellesley|Wellesley]].<ref name=\"BM\"/>\n\n[[File:Illustrirte Zeitung (1843) 21 332 1 Das vom Stapellaufen des Great-Britain.PNG|thumb|Launch of ''Great Britain'' at Bristol, July 1843]]\n\nIntroductions were made, followed by the \"Address to His Royal Highness the Prince Albert\", by the town clerk, D.

This historic photograph by [[William Fox Talbot|William Talbot]] is believed to be the first ever taken of a ship. ]]\nFollowing the launch ceremony, the builders had planned to have ''Great Britain'' towed to the [[Thames]] for her final fitting out. Unfortunately, the harbour authorities had failed to carry out the necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner.{{sfn|Dumpleton|Miller|2013|p=64}} Exacerbating the problem, the ship had been widened beyond the original plans to accommodate the propeller engines, and her designers had made a belated decision to fit the engines prior to launch, which resulted in a deeper [[draft (ship)|draught]].{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=21}}\n\nThis dilemma was to result in another costly delay for the company, as Brunel's negotiations with the Bristol Dock Board dragged on for months.

Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (Harbour Master) at Bristol) enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the [[tugboat|tug]] ''Samson,'' again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.<ref>{{cite web|title=The creation of Bristol City docks |work=Farvis |url=http://www.farvis.com/2013site/history%20of%20bristol/bruneldocks.html |access-date=17 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110611/http://www.farvis.com/2013site/history%20of%20bristol/bruneldocks.html |archive-date= 2 April 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\n===General description===\n[[File:SS Great Britain diagram.jpg|thumb|Sketch of ''Great Britain''. The lower image shows the internal arrangement of her decks and machinery.]]\nWhen completed in 1845, ''Great Britain'' was a revolutionary vessel\u2014the first ship to combine an iron hull with screw propulsion, and at {{convert|322|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length and with a 3,400-ton displacement, more than {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} longer and 1,000&nbsp;tons larger than any ship previously built. Her [[beam (ship)|beam]] was {{convert|50|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} and her height from keel to main deck, {{convert|32|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}. She had four decks, including the [[spar deck|spar (upper) deck]], a crew of 120, and was fitted to accommodate a total of 360 passengers, along with 1,200&nbsp;tons of cargo and 1,200&nbsp;tons of [[coal]] for fuel.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=3}}\n\nLike other steamships of the era, ''Great Britain'' was provided with secondary sail power, consisting of one [[square-rig]]ged and five [[schooner]]-rigged masts\u2014a relatively simple sail plan designed to reduce the number of crew required. The masts were of iron, fastened to the spar deck with iron joints, and with one exception, hinged to allow their lowering to reduce wind resistance in the event of a strong headwind. The rigging was of iron cable instead of the traditional [[hemp]], again with a view to reducing wind resistance.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|pp=19\u201320}} Another innovative feature was the lack of traditional heavy bulwarks around the main deck; a light iron railing {{sfn|Fox|2003|p=152}} both reduced weight and allowed water shipped in heavy weather to run unimpeded back to sea.\n\nThe hull and single [[chimney|funnel]] amidships were both finished in black paint, with a single white stripe running the length of the hull highlighting a row of false gunports. The hull was flat-bottomed, with no external [[keel]], and with bulges low on each side amidships which continued toward the [[stern]] in an unusual implementation of [[tumblehome]]\u2014a result of the late decision to install propeller engines, which were wider at the base than the originally planned paddlewheel engines.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=149, 152}}\n\nBrunel, anxious to ensure the avoidance of [[Hogging and sagging|hogging]] in a vessel of such unprecedented size, designed the hull to be massively redundant in strength. Ten longitudinal iron girders were installed along the keel, running from beneath the engines and boiler to the forward section. The iron ribs were {{convert|6|x|3|in|cm}} in size. The iron keel plates were an inch thick, and the hull seams were lapped and double [[rivet]]ed in many places. Safety features, which also contributed to the structural strength of the vessel, included a [[double bottom]] and five watertight iron [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]].{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=150}}{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=5}} The total amount of iron, including the engines and machinery, was 1,500&nbsp;tons.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=18}}\n\n===Machinery===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 =  SS Great Britain transverse section.jpg \n| width1 =  120 \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Transverse hull section, showing arrangement of gearwheels, gear chains and engine cylinders\n| image2 =  SS Great Britain engine and gearwheels lateral section.jpg \n| width2 =  100 \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 =  Side view of engines, showing arrangement of gears and gear chains between the engines \n| footer = \n}}[[File:Model of SS Great Britain's engines.jpg|thumb|right|upright| A model of ''Great Britain''{{'}}s engines]]\nTwo giant propeller engines were installed amidships. They had a combined weight of 340&nbsp;tons.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=18}} They were built to a modified patent of Brunel's father [[Marc Isambard Brunel|Marc]]. The engines, which rose from the keel through the three lower decks to a height just below the main deck, were of the [[marine steam engine#Direct acting|direct-acting]] type, with twin {{convert|88|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[bore (engine)|bore]], {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]] inclined upward at a 60\u00b0 angle, capable of developing a total of {{convert|1000|hp}} at 18&nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]].{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=150}}{{sfn|Claxton|1845|pp=3\u20136}} Steam power was provided by three {{convert|34|ft|m|adj=mid}} long by {{convert|22|ft|m|adj=mid}} high by {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid}} wide, {{convert|5|psi|abbr=on}} \"square\" saltwater [[boiler]]s, forward of the engines, with eight furnaces each&nbsp;\u2013 four at each end.{{ref|a|note a}}\n\nIn considering the gearing arrangement, Brunel had no precedent to serve as a guide. The gearing for ''Archimedes'', of the spur-and-pinion type, had proven almost unbearably noisy, and would not be suitable for a passenger ship.{{sfn|Fox|2003|pp=148\u2013149}} Brunel's solution was to install a [[chain drive]]. On the crankshaft between ''Great Britain''{{'}}s two engines, he installed a {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=mid}} diameter primary gearwheel,{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=6}} which, by means of a set of four massive inverted-tooth or \"silent\" chains, operated the smaller secondary gear near the keel, which turned the propeller shaft. This was the first commercial use of silent chain technology, and the individual silent chains installed in ''Great Britain'' are thought to have been the largest ever constructed.{{sfn|American Chain Association|2005|p=10}}\n\n''Great Britain''{{'}}s main propeller shaft, built by the Mersey Iron Works, was the largest single piece of machinery. {{convert|68|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|28|in|cm}} in diameter, the shaft was bored with a {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=mid}} diameter hole, reducing its weight and allowing cold water to be pumped through to reduce heat. At each end of the main propeller shaft were two secondary coupling shafts: a {{convert|28|ft|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|16|in|cm|adj=mid}} diameter shaft beneath the engine, and a screw shaft of {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter {{convert|16|in|cm}} at the stern. Total length of the three shafts was {{convert|130|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and the total weight 38&nbsp;tons.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=18}} The shaft was geared upward at a ratio of 1 to 3, so that at the engines' normal operating speed of 18&nbsp;rpm, the propeller turned at a speed of 54&nbsp;rpm.{{sfn|American Chain Association|2005|p=10}} The initial propeller was a six-bladed \"windmill\" model of Brunel's own design,{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=151}} {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and with pitch of {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=13}}\n\n===Interior===\n[[File:SS Great Britain 1st class dining room.jpg|thumb|left | Looking down one aisle of the reconstructed dining saloon in the museum ship SS ''Great Britain'']]\nThe interior was divided into three decks, the upper two for passengers and the lower for cargo. The two passenger decks were divided into forward and aft compartments, separated by the engines and boiler amidships.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=4, 6}}\n\nIn the after section of the ship, the upper passenger deck contained the after or principal saloon, {{convert|110|ft|m|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|48|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, which ran from just aft of the engine room to the stern. On each side of the saloon were corridors leading to 22 individual passenger berths, arranged two deep, a total of 44 berths for the saloon as a whole. The forward part of the saloon, nearest the engine room, contained two {{convert|17|x|14|ft|m|adj=on}} ladies' boudoirs or private sitting rooms, which could be accessed without entering the saloon from the 12 nearest passenger berths, reserved for females. The opposite end of the saloon opened onto the stern windows. Broad iron staircases at both ends of the saloon ran to the main deck above and the dining saloon below. The saloon was painted in \"delicate tints\", furnished along its length with fixed chairs of [[oak]], and supported by 12 decorated pillars.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|pp=14\u201317}}\n\nBeneath the after saloon was the main or dining saloon, {{convert|98|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, with dining tables and chairs capable of accommodating up to 360 people at one sitting. On each side of the saloon, seven corridors opened onto four berths each, for a total number of berths per side of 28, 56 altogether. The forward end of the saloon was connected to a stewards' galley, while the opposite end contained several tiers of sofas. This saloon was apparently the ship's most impressive of all the passenger spaces. Columns of white and gold, 24 in number, with \"ornamental capitals of great beauty\", were arranged down its length and along the walls, while eight [[Arabesque (European art)|Arabesque]] [[pilaster]]s, decorated with \"beautifully painted\" oriental flowers and birds, enhanced the aesthetic effect. The archways of the doors were \"tastefully carved and gilded\" and surmounted with medallion heads. Mirrors around the walls added an illusion of spaciousness, and the walls themselves were painted in a \"delicate lemon-tinted hue\" with highlights of blue and gold.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|pp=14\u201317}}\n\nThe two forward saloons were arranged in a similar plan to the after saloons, with the upper \"promenade\" saloon having 36 berths per side and the lower 30, totalling 132. Further forward, separate from the passenger saloons, were the crew quarters.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|pp=14\u201317}} The overall finish of the passenger quarters was unusually restrained for its time, a probable reflection of the proprietors' diminishing capital reserves.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=153}} Total cost of construction of the ship, not including \u00a353,000 for plant and equipment to build her, was \u00a3117,000{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=155}}\u2014\u00a347,000 more than her original projected price tag of \u00a370,000.\n\n==Service history==\n\n===Transatlantic service===\n[[File:SS Great Britain - geograph.org.uk - 1135916.jpg|thumb|The main funnel]]\nOn 26 July 1845\u2014seven years after the Great Western Steamship Company had decided to build a second ship, and five years overdue\u2014''Great Britain'' embarked on her maiden voyage, from [[Liverpool]] to [[New York City|New York]] under Captain [[James Hosken]], with 45 passengers. The ship made the passage in 14 days and 21 hours, at an average speed of {{convert|9.25|kn}}&nbsp;\u2013 almost {{convert|1.5|kn}} slower than the prevailing record.

On her next crossing to New York, carrying 104 passengers, the ship ran into heavy weather, losing a mast and three propeller blades.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=68\u201378}} On 13 October, she ran aground on the Massachusetts Shoals.

The ship rolled heavily, especially in calm weather without the steadying influence of sail, causing discomfort to passengers.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=153}}\n\nThe shareholders of the company again provided further funding to try to solve the problems. The six-bladed propeller was dispensed with and replaced with the original four-bladed, cast iron design. The third mast was removed, and the iron rigging, which had proven unsatisfactory, was replaced with conventional rigging.

The keel, badly damaged during the grounding, was completely renewed along a length of {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=off}}, and the owners took the opportunity to further strengthen the hull. The old [[keelson]]s were replaced and ten new ones laid, which ran the entire length of the keel. Both the bow and stern were also strengthened by heavy frames of double [[angle iron]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1910|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\nReflecting the rapid advances in propeller engine technology, the original engines were removed and replaced with a pair of smaller, lighter and more modern [[marine steam engine|oscillating]] engines, with {{convert|82+1/2|in|cm|adj=on}} cylinders and {{convert|6|ft|cm|adj=on}} stroke, built by [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn & Sons]] of [[Greenwich]].

The three large boilers were replaced with six smaller ones, operating at {{convert|10|psi|abbr=on}} or twice the pressure of their predecessors. Along with a new {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} cabin on the main deck, the smaller boilers allowed the cargo capacity to be almost doubled, from 1,200 to 2,200&nbsp;tons.{{sfn|Fletcher|1910|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\nThe four-bladed propeller was replaced by a slightly smaller three-bladed model, and the bilge keels, previously added to reduce the tendency to roll, were replaced by a heavy external oak keel for the same purpose.

She was the longest passenger ship in the world from 1845 to 1854. She was designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (1806\u20131859), for the [[Great Western Steamship Company]]'s [[transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] service between [[Bristol]] and [[New York City|New York]]. While other ships had been built of iron or equipped with a [[Propeller (marine)|screw propeller]], ''Great Britain'' was the first to combine these features in a large ocean-going ship. She was the first iron steamer to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], which she did in 1845, in the time of 14 days.\n\nThe ship is {{convert|322|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length and has a 3,400-ton displacement. She was powered by two inclined 2 cylinder engines of the [[marine steam engine#Direct acting|direct-acting]] type, with twin high pressure cylinders (diameter uncertain) and twin low pressure cylinders {{convert|88|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[bore (engine)|bore]], all of {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]]. She was also provided with secondary masts for sail power. The four decks provided accommodation for a crew of 120, plus 360 passengers who were provided with cabins, and dining and promenade saloons.\n\nWhen launched in 1843, ''Great Britain'' was by far the largest vessel afloat. But her protracted construction time of six years (1839\u20131845) and high cost had left her owners in a difficult financial position, and they were forced out of business in 1846, having spent all their remaining funds refloating the ship after she ran aground at [[Dundrum, County Down#History|Dundrum Bay]] in [[County Down, Northern Ireland|County Down]] near [[Newcastle, Northern Ireland|Newcastle]] in what is now [[Northern Ireland]], after a [[navigation]] error. In 1852 she was sold for [[marine salvage|salvage]] and repaired. ''Great Britain'' later carried thousands of [[Immigration to Australia|immigrants to Australia]] from 1852 until being converted to all-sail in 1881. Three years later, she was retired to the [[Falkland Islands]], where she was used as a warehouse, quarantine ship and [[hulk (ship)|coal hulk]] until she was [[scuttling|scuttled]] and sunk in 1937, 98 years since being [[keel laying|laid down]] at the start of her construction.{{sfn|Gibbs1957|pp=41\u201354}}\n\nIn 1970, after ''Great Britain'' had lain under water and abandoned for 33 years, Sir [[Jack Hayward|Jack Arnold Hayward]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1923\u20132015) paid for the vessel to be raised and repaired enough to be towed north through the Atlantic back to the United Kingdom, and returned to the Bristol [[dry dock]] where she had been built 127 years earlier. Hayward was a prominent businessman, developer, philanthropist and owner of the English football club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Now listed as part of the [[National Historic Fleet]], ''Great Britain'' is a visitor attraction and museum ship in [[Bristol Harbour]], with between 150,000 and 200,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Great Western maiden voyage.jpg|thumb|left|The {{SS|Great Western}} on her maiden voyage]]\nAfter the initial success of its first liner, {{SS|Great Western}} of 1838, the [[Great Western Steamship Company]] collected materials for a sister ship, tentatively named ''City of New York''.{{sfn|Gibbs1957|pp=41\u201354}} The same engineering team that had collaborated so successfully on ''Great Western''\u2014[[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Isambard Brunel]], Thomas Guppy, Christopher Claxton and [[William Patterson (engineer)|William Patterson]]\u2014was again assembled. This time however, Brunel, whose reputation was at its height, came to assert overall control over design of the ship\u2014a state of affairs that would have far-reaching consequences for the company. Construction was carried out in a specially adapted [[dry dock]] in [[Bristol]], England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunel200.com/ss_great_britain.htm |title=SS ''Great Britain'' |work=Brunel 200 |access-date=31 December 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514110144/http://www.brunel200.com/ss_great_britain.htm |archive-date=14 May 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Adoption of iron hull===\nTwo chance encounters were to profoundly affect the design of ''Great Britain''. In late 1838, [[John Laird (shipbuilder)|John Laird's]] {{convert|213|ft|m|adj=on}} [[English Channel]] [[packet ship]] ''Rainbow''\u2014the largest iron-[[hull (watercraft)|hulled]] ship then in service\u2014made a stop at Bristol. Brunel despatched his associates Christopher Claxton and William Patterson to make a return voyage to [[Antwerp]] on ''Rainbow'' to assess the utility of the new building material. Both men returned as converts to iron-hulled technology, and Brunel scrapped his plans to build a wooden ship and persuaded the company directors to build an iron-hulled ship.{{sfn|Fox|2003|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\n''Great Britain''{{'}}s builders recognised a number of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to [[dry rot]] or [[woodworm]], and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit on the length of a wooden-hulled ship is about 300&nbsp;feet, after which [[hogging and sagging|hogging]]\u2014the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it\u2014becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging, so that the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is much greater.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=144}} The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400&nbsp;tons, over 1,000&nbsp;tons larger than any ship then in existence.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=148}}\n\n===Adoption of screw propulsion===\n[[File:SS Archimedes by Huggins cropped.jpg|thumb|left | Artist's impression of {{SS|Archimedes||}}]]\n[[File:Great Britain propeller and rudder wideshot.jpg|thumb|Replica of ''Great Britain''{{'}}s original six-bladed propeller on the museum ship. This propeller proved totally unsatisfactory in service and was quickly replaced with a four-bladed model.]]\nIn early 1840, a second chance encounter occurred, the arrival of the revolutionary {{SS|Archimedes||}} at Bristol, the first [[propeller|screw-propelled]] steamship, completed only a few months before by [[Francis Pettit Smith|F. P. Smith's]] Propeller Steamship Company. Brunel had been looking into methods of improving the performance of ''Great Britain''{{'}}s [[paddlewheel]]s, and took an immediate interest in the new technology. Smith, sensing a prestigious new customer for his own company, agreed to lend ''Archimedes'' to Brunel for extended tests.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=148}} Over several months, Smith and Brunel tested a number of different propellers on ''Archimedes'' to find the most efficient design, a four-bladed model submitted by Smith.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=148, 151}}\n\nHaving satisfied himself as to the advantages of screw propulsion, Brunel wrote to the company directors to persuade them to embark on a second major design change, abandoning the paddlewheel engines\u2014already half constructed\u2014for completely new engines suitable for powering a propeller.\n\nBrunel listed the advantages of the screw propeller over the paddlewheel as follows:\n\n* Screw propulsion machinery was lighter in weight, thus improving fuel economy;\n* Screw propulsion machinery could be kept lower in the hull, lowering the ship's centre of gravity and making it more stable in heavy seas;\n* By taking up less room, propeller engines would allow more cargo to be carried;\n* Elimination of bulky paddle-boxes would lessen resistance through the water, and also allow the ship to manoeuvre more easily in confined waterways;\n* The depth of a paddlewheel is constantly changing, depending on the ship's cargo and the movement of waves, while a propeller stays fully submerged and at full efficiency at all times;\n* Screw propulsion machinery was cheaper.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=149}}\n\nBrunel's arguments proved persuasive, and in December 1840, the company agreed to adopt the new technology. The decision became a costly one, setting the ship's completion back by nine months.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=149}}\n\nReporting on the ship's arrival in New York, in its first issue ''[[Scientific American]]'' opined, \"If there is any thing objectionable in the construction or machinery of this noble ship, it is the mode of propelling her by the screw propeller; and we should not be surprised if it should be, ere long, superseded by paddle wheels at the sides.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v303/n2/box/scientificamerican0810-12_BX1.html |title=165 Years Ago, Happy Birthday to Us |journal=[[Scientific American]] |access-date=14 March 2015 |volume=303 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0810-12 |pages=12\u201313 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405104323/http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v303/n2/box/scientificamerican0810-12_BX1.html |archive-date= 5 April 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Launch==\n[[File:Launch-of-the-SS-GB.jpg|right|thumb|A painting of the launch in 1843]]\nThe launching or, more accurately, the [[float-out]] took place on 19 July 1843. Conditions were generally favourable and diarists recorded that, after a dull start, the weather brightened with only a few intermittent showers. The atmosphere of the day can best be gauged from a report the following day in ''The Bristol Mirror'':\n\n<blockquote>Large crowds started to gather early in the day including many people who had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle. There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed in a neat orderly formation down the entire length of the Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on the streets as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.<ref name=BM>{{cite news | title=Royal Visit| work=The Bristol Mirror| pages=1\u20132| date=20 July 1843| url= }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] arrived at 10 a.m. at the Great Western Railway terminus.

The Prince Consort, dressed as a private gentleman, was accompanied by his [[equerry]]-in-waiting, personal secretary, the [[Brownlow Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], and Lords [[James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe|Wharncliffe]], [[Charles Jenkinson, 3rd Earl of Liverpool|Liverpool]], [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle|Lincoln]] and [[Lord Charles Wellesley|Wellesley]].<ref name=\"BM\"/>\n\n[[File:Illustrirte Zeitung (1843) 21 332 1 Das vom Stapellaufen des Great-Britain.PNG|thumb|Launch of ''Great Britain'' at Bristol, July 1843]]\n\nIntroductions were made, followed by the \"Address to His Royal Highness the Prince Albert\", by the town clerk, D.

This historic photograph by [[William Fox Talbot|William Talbot]] is believed to be the first ever taken of a ship. ]]\nFollowing the launch ceremony, the builders had planned to have ''Great Britain'' towed to the [[Thames]] for her final fitting out. Unfortunately, the harbour authorities had failed to carry out the necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner.{{sfn|Dumpleton|Miller|2013|p=64}} Exacerbating the problem, the ship had been widened beyond the original plans to accommodate the propeller engines, and her designers had made a belated decision to fit the engines prior to launch, which resulted in a deeper [[draft (ship)|draught]].{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=21}}\n\nThis dilemma was to result in another costly delay for the company, as Brunel's negotiations with the Bristol Dock Board dragged on for months.

Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (Harbour Master) at Bristol) enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the [[tugboat|tug]] ''Samson,'' again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.<ref>{{cite web|title=The creation of Bristol City docks |work=Farvis |url=http://www.farvis.com/2013site/history%20of%20bristol/bruneldocks.html |access-date=17 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110611/http://www.farvis.com/2013site/history%20of%20bristol/bruneldocks.html |archive-date= 2 April 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\n===General description===\n[[File:SS Great Britain diagram.jpg|thumb|Sketch of ''Great Britain''. The lower image shows the internal arrangement of her decks and machinery.]]\nWhen completed in 1845, ''Great Britain'' was a revolutionary vessel\u2014the first ship to combine an iron hull with screw propulsion, and at {{convert|322|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length and with a 3,400-ton displacement, more than {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} longer and 1,000&nbsp;tons larger than any ship previously built. Her [[beam (ship)|beam]] was {{convert|50|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} and her height from keel to main deck, {{convert|32|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}. She had four decks, including the [[spar deck|spar (upper) deck]], a crew of 120, and was fitted to accommodate a total of 360 passengers, along with 1,200&nbsp;tons of cargo and 1,200&nbsp;tons of [[coal]] for fuel.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=3}}\n\nLike other steamships of the era, ''Great Britain'' was provided with secondary sail power, consisting of one [[square-rig]]ged and five [[schooner]]-rigged masts\u2014a relatively simple sail plan designed to reduce the number of crew required. The masts were of iron, fastened to the spar deck with iron joints, and with one exception, hinged to allow their lowering to reduce wind resistance in the event of a strong headwind. The rigging was of iron cable instead of the traditional [[hemp]], again with a view to reducing wind resistance.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|pp=19\u201320}} Another innovative feature was the lack of traditional heavy bulwarks around the main deck; a light iron railing {{sfn|Fox|2003|p=152}} both reduced weight and allowed water shipped in heavy weather to run unimpeded back to sea.\n\nThe hull and single [[chimney|funnel]] amidships were both finished in black paint, with a single white stripe running the length of the hull highlighting a row of false gunports. The hull was flat-bottomed, with no external [[keel]], and with bulges low on each side amidships which continued toward the [[stern]] in an unusual implementation of [[tumblehome]]\u2014a result of the late decision to install propeller engines, which were wider at the base than the originally planned paddlewheel engines.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=149, 152}}\n\nBrunel, anxious to ensure the avoidance of [[Hogging and sagging|hogging]] in a vessel of such unprecedented size, designed the hull to be massively redundant in strength. Ten longitudinal iron girders were installed along the keel, running from beneath the engines and boiler to the forward section. The iron ribs were {{convert|6|x|3|in|cm}} in size. The iron keel plates were an inch thick, and the hull seams were lapped and double [[rivet]]ed in many places. Safety features, which also contributed to the structural strength of the vessel, included a [[double bottom]] and five watertight iron [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]].{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=150}}{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=5}} The total amount of iron, including the engines and machinery, was 1,500&nbsp;tons.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=18}}\n\n===Machinery===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 =  SS Great Britain transverse section.jpg \n| width1 =  120 \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Transverse hull section, showing arrangement of gearwheels, gear chains and engine cylinders\n| image2 =  SS Great Britain engine and gearwheels lateral section.jpg \n| width2 =  100 \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 =  Side view of engines, showing arrangement of gears and gear chains between the engines \n| footer = \n}}[[File:Model of SS Great Britain's engines.jpg|thumb|right|upright| A model of ''Great Britain''{{'}}s engines]]\nTwo giant propeller engines were installed amidships. They had a combined weight of 340&nbsp;tons.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=18}} They were built to a modified patent of Brunel's father [[Marc Isambard Brunel|Marc]]. The engines, which rose from the keel through the three lower decks to a height just below the main deck, were of the [[marine steam engine#Direct acting|direct-acting]] type, with twin {{convert|88|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[bore (engine)|bore]], {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]] inclined upward at a 60\u00b0 angle, capable of developing a total of {{convert|1000|hp}} at 18&nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]].{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=150}}{{sfn|Claxton|1845|pp=3\u20136}} Steam power was provided by three {{convert|34|ft|m|adj=mid}} long by {{convert|22|ft|m|adj=mid}} high by {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid}} wide, {{convert|5|psi|abbr=on}} \"square\" saltwater [[boiler]]s, forward of the engines, with eight furnaces each&nbsp;\u2013 four at each end.{{ref|a|note a}}\n\nIn considering the gearing arrangement, Brunel had no precedent to serve as a guide. The gearing for ''Archimedes'', of the spur-and-pinion type, had proven almost unbearably noisy, and would not be suitable for a passenger ship.{{sfn|Fox|2003|pp=148\u2013149}} Brunel's solution was to install a [[chain drive]]. On the crankshaft between ''Great Britain''{{'}}s two engines, he installed a {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=mid}} diameter primary gearwheel,{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=6}} which, by means of a set of four massive inverted-tooth or \"silent\" chains, operated the smaller secondary gear near the keel, which turned the propeller shaft. This was the first commercial use of silent chain technology, and the individual silent chains installed in ''Great Britain'' are thought to have been the largest ever constructed.{{sfn|American Chain Association|2005|p=10}}\n\n''Great Britain''{{'}}s main propeller shaft, built by the Mersey Iron Works, was the largest single piece of machinery. {{convert|68|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|28|in|cm}} in diameter, the shaft was bored with a {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=mid}} diameter hole, reducing its weight and allowing cold water to be pumped through to reduce heat. At each end of the main propeller shaft were two secondary coupling shafts: a {{convert|28|ft|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|16|in|cm|adj=mid}} diameter shaft beneath the engine, and a screw shaft of {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter {{convert|16|in|cm}} at the stern. Total length of the three shafts was {{convert|130|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and the total weight 38&nbsp;tons.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=18}} The shaft was geared upward at a ratio of 1 to 3, so that at the engines' normal operating speed of 18&nbsp;rpm, the propeller turned at a speed of 54&nbsp;rpm.{{sfn|American Chain Association|2005|p=10}} The initial propeller was a six-bladed \"windmill\" model of Brunel's own design,{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=151}} {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and with pitch of {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=13}}\n\n===Interior===\n[[File:SS Great Britain 1st class dining room.jpg|thumb|left | Looking down one aisle of the reconstructed dining saloon in the museum ship SS ''Great Britain'']]\nThe interior was divided into three decks, the upper two for passengers and the lower for cargo. The two passenger decks were divided into forward and aft compartments, separated by the engines and boiler amidships.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|p=4, 6}}\n\nIn the after section of the ship, the upper passenger deck contained the after or principal saloon, {{convert|110|ft|m|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|48|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, which ran from just aft of the engine room to the stern. On each side of the saloon were corridors leading to 22 individual passenger berths, arranged two deep, a total of 44 berths for the saloon as a whole. The forward part of the saloon, nearest the engine room, contained two {{convert|17|x|14|ft|m|adj=on}} ladies' boudoirs or private sitting rooms, which could be accessed without entering the saloon from the 12 nearest passenger berths, reserved for females. The opposite end of the saloon opened onto the stern windows. Broad iron staircases at both ends of the saloon ran to the main deck above and the dining saloon below. The saloon was painted in \"delicate tints\", furnished along its length with fixed chairs of [[oak]], and supported by 12 decorated pillars.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|pp=14\u201317}}\n\nBeneath the after saloon was the main or dining saloon, {{convert|98|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, with dining tables and chairs capable of accommodating up to 360 people at one sitting. On each side of the saloon, seven corridors opened onto four berths each, for a total number of berths per side of 28, 56 altogether. The forward end of the saloon was connected to a stewards' galley, while the opposite end contained several tiers of sofas. This saloon was apparently the ship's most impressive of all the passenger spaces. Columns of white and gold, 24 in number, with \"ornamental capitals of great beauty\", were arranged down its length and along the walls, while eight [[Arabesque (European art)|Arabesque]] [[pilaster]]s, decorated with \"beautifully painted\" oriental flowers and birds, enhanced the aesthetic effect. The archways of the doors were \"tastefully carved and gilded\" and surmounted with medallion heads. Mirrors around the walls added an illusion of spaciousness, and the walls themselves were painted in a \"delicate lemon-tinted hue\" with highlights of blue and gold.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|pp=14\u201317}}\n\nThe two forward saloons were arranged in a similar plan to the after saloons, with the upper \"promenade\" saloon having 36 berths per side and the lower 30, totalling 132. Further forward, separate from the passenger saloons, were the crew quarters.{{sfn|Claxton|1845|pp=14\u201317}} The overall finish of the passenger quarters was unusually restrained for its time, a probable reflection of the proprietors' diminishing capital reserves.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=153}} Total cost of construction of the ship, not including \u00a353,000 for plant and equipment to build her, was \u00a3117,000{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=155}}\u2014\u00a347,000 more than her original projected price tag of \u00a370,000.\n\n==Service history==\n\n===Transatlantic service===\n[[File:SS Great Britain - geograph.org.uk - 1135916.jpg|thumb|The main funnel]]\nOn 26 July 1845\u2014seven years after the Great Western Steamship Company had decided to build a second ship, and five years overdue\u2014''Great Britain'' embarked on her maiden voyage, from [[Liverpool]] to [[New York City|New York]] under Captain [[James Hosken]], with 45 passengers. The ship made the passage in 14 days and 21 hours, at an average speed of {{convert|9.25|kn}}&nbsp;\u2013 almost {{convert|1.5|kn}} slower than the prevailing record.

On her next crossing to New York, carrying 104 passengers, the ship ran into heavy weather, losing a mast and three propeller blades.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=68\u201378}} On 13 October, she ran aground on the Massachusetts Shoals.

The ship rolled heavily, especially in calm weather without the steadying influence of sail, causing discomfort to passengers.{{sfn|Fox|2003|p=153}}\n\nThe shareholders of the company again provided further funding to try to solve the problems. The six-bladed propeller was dispensed with and replaced with the original four-bladed, cast iron design. The third mast was removed, and the iron rigging, which had proven unsatisfactory, was replaced with conventional rigging.

The keel, badly damaged during the grounding, was completely renewed along a length of {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=off}}, and the owners took the opportunity to further strengthen the hull. The old [[keelson]]s were replaced and ten new ones laid, which ran the entire length of the keel. Both the bow and stern were also strengthened by heavy frames of double [[angle iron]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1910|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\nReflecting the rapid advances in propeller engine technology, the original engines were removed and replaced with a pair of smaller, lighter and more modern [[marine steam engine|oscillating]] engines, with {{convert|82+1/2|in|cm|adj=on}} cylinders and {{convert|6|ft|cm|adj=on}} stroke, built by [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn & Sons]] of [[Greenwich]].

The three large boilers were replaced with six smaller ones, operating at {{convert|10|psi|abbr=on}} or twice the pressure of their predecessors. Along with a new {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} cabin on the main deck, the smaller boilers allowed the cargo capacity to be almost doubled, from 1,200 to 2,200&nbsp;tons.{{sfn|Fletcher|1910|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\nThe four-bladed propeller was replaced by a slightly smaller three-bladed model, and the bilge keels, previously added to reduce the tendency to roll, were replaced by a heavy external oak keel for the same purpose.

Passenger services ended in 1962 when the platforms were removed during electrification of the WCML to allow the curvature of the tracks to be eased. Later the bridges for the [[North London Line]] (NLL) were rebuilt.\n\nThe High-Level station on the NLL was opened by the [[North London Railway]] in 1869 for two Richmond tracks and later for two Shepherds Bush tracks, both crossing the WCML roughly at right angles. In 1894 a new, combined High-Level station was built, with an island platform plus a third shorter platform for Earls Court trains (which was later removed) together with a new station entrance building which still survives. By 1897 199 passenger and 47 goods trains passed through the High-Level station each day.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk//html5/reader/production/default.aspx?&edid=7b86f0f7-498d-4a9a-aa51-b450bfa24a8f|title=Twenty-four hours at a railway junction|last=Whitechurch|first=V L|date=September 1897|website=|publisher=Railway Magazine|pages=263\u2013271|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The 'Willesden New Station' or Low-Level station on the [[Watford DC Line]] was opened in 1910 to the north of the main line with two outer through platforms and two inner bay platforms at the London end. The bay platforms were originally long enough for four-coach Bakerloo trains when such trains ran outside peak times, but were shortened in the 1960s when a new toilet block was installed; in more recent times the platform buildings have been reconstructed and the bay length increased due to the addition of a fourth and then a fifth coach to class 378 trains.\n\nIn 1896 staff totalled 271, including 79 porters, 58 signalmen (in 14 signal boxes) and 58 shunters and yard foremen.

Passenger services ended in 1962 when the platforms were removed during electrification of the WCML to allow the curvature of the tracks to be eased. Later the bridges for the [[North London Line]] (NLL) were rebuilt.\n\nThe High-Level station on the NLL was opened by the [[North London Railway]] in 1869 for two Richmond tracks and later for two Shepherds Bush tracks, both crossing the WCML roughly at right angles. In 1894 a new, combined High-Level station was built, with an island platform plus a third shorter platform for Earls Court trains (which was later removed) together with a new station entrance building which still survives. By 1897 199 passenger and 47 goods trains passed through the High-Level station each day.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk//html5/reader/production/default.aspx?&edid=7b86f0f7-498d-4a9a-aa51-b450bfa24a8f|title=Twenty-four hours at a railway junction|last=Whitechurch|first=V L|date=September 1897|website=|publisher=Railway Magazine|pages=263\u2013271|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The 'Willesden New Station' or Low-Level station on the [[Watford DC Line]] was opened in 1910 to the north of the main line with two outer through platforms and two inner bay platforms at the London end. The bay platforms were originally long enough for four-coach Bakerloo trains when such trains ran outside peak times, but were shortened in the 1960s when a new toilet block was installed; in more recent times the platform buildings have been reconstructed and the bay length increased due to the addition of a fourth and then a fifth coach to class 378 trains.\n\nIn 1896 staff totalled 271, including 79 porters, 58 signalmen (in 14 signal boxes) and 58 shunters and yard foremen. They issued 1,006,886 tickets to passengers in 1896, up from 530,300 in 1886.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many of them were housed in what is now the Old Oak Lane conservation area, built by the LNWR in 1889<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ealing.cmis.uk.com/Ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=YtpH9O67q9ubgB6Cm6zqmAsuagET25CgjFZZ4VhOJieWsTm8o1q+PA==&rUzwRPf+Z3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw===pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ/LUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ==&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg===hFflUdN3100=&kCx1AnS9/pWZQ40DXFvdEw===hFflUdN3100=&uJovDxwdjMPoYv+AJvYtyA===ctNJFf55vVA=&FgPlIEJYlotS+YGoBi5olA===NHdURQburHA=&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA=&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA=&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA=|title=Old Oak Lane Conservation Area Character Appraisal|last=|first=|date=2006|website=ealing.cmis.uk.com|publisher=Ealing Council|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> and which included an Institute, reading room and church.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe main-line platforms were numbered from the south side (including one or two on the Kensington route) followed by the high level platforms and then the DC line platforms which thus had the highest numbers.

The character, a scientist that debuted in a standalone [[science-fiction]] [[anthology]] story, returned several issues later as the original iteration of the superhero '''[[Ant-Man]]''' with the power to shrink to the size of an [[insect]]. Alongside his crime-fighting partner-wife [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], he goes on to assume other superhero identities, including the size-changing '''[[Giant-Man]]''' and '''[[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]]'''; the insect-themed '''[[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]]'''; and briefly the '''[[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]'''. He is a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\nDebuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Hank Pym has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated films]]; [[video game]]s; and [[television series]]. [[Michael Douglas]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:TTA-35.jpg|thumb|left|Hank Pym debuts as Ant-Man: ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #35 (Sept. 1962).

The creative team was editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], [[penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]], and [[inker]] [[Dick Ayers]], with Lee stating in 2008: \"I did one comic book called 'The Man in the Ant Hill' about a guy who shrunk down and there were ants or bees chasing him.

The character's adventures became an ongoing feature in the title. Issue #44 (June 1963) featured the debut of his [[socialite]] girlfriend and laboratory assistant [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]]. Janet adopted the costumed identity of the Wasp, and co-starred in Pym's subsequent appearances in ''Tales to Astonish''. Wasp also on occasion acted as a framing-sequence host for backup stories in the title. In September 1963, Lee and Kirby created the superhero title ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', and Ant-Man and Wasp were established in issue #1 as founding members of the team.\n\nDecades later, Lee theorized as to why \"Ant-Man never became one of our top sellers or had his own book,\" saying,\n\n{{quote|I loved Ant-Man, but the stories were never really successful. In order for Ant-Man to be successful, he had to be drawn this small next to big things and you would be getting pictures that were visually interesting. The artists who drew him, no matter how much I kept reminding them, they kept forgetting that fact. They would draw him standing on a tabletop and they would draw a heroic-looking guy. I would say, 'Draw a matchbook cover next to him, so we see the difference in size.' But they kept forgetting. So when you would look at the panels, you thought you were looking at a normal guy wearing an underwear costume like all of them.

The character is expelled from the [[Ultimates]] after his abusive behavior ends his marriage and his Giant-Man serum is used by S.H.I.E.L.D. to make an entire Giant-Men team.

Created by [[Penciller|penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]], editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]] and scripter [[Larry Lieber]],<!--no confirmation of \"Marvel Method\" being used on pre-superhero Marvel monster stories, historical accounts of which refer to as having full scripts--> the character first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #27 (January 1962). The character, a scientist that debuted in a standalone [[science-fiction]] [[anthology]] story, returned several issues later as the original iteration of the superhero '''[[Ant-Man]]''' with the power to shrink to the size of an [[insect]]. Alongside his crime-fighting partner-wife [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], he goes on to assume other superhero identities, including the size-changing '''[[Giant-Man]]''' and '''[[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]]'''; the insect-themed '''[[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]]'''; and briefly the '''[[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]'''. He is a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\nDebuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Hank Pym has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated films]]; [[video game]]s; and [[television series]]. [[Michael Douglas]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:TTA-35.jpg|thumb|left|Hank Pym debuts as Ant-Man: ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #35 (Sept. 1962).

The creative team was editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], [[penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]], and [[inker]] [[Dick Ayers]], with Lee stating in 2008: \"I did one comic book called 'The Man in the Ant Hill' about a guy who shrunk down and there were ants or bees chasing him. That sold so well that I thought making him into a superhero might be fun.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=William | last=Keck | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-06-22-marvel-magic_N.htm | title=Here come Marvel's 'Avengers,' and Stan Lee, Joe Simon weigh in | work=[[USA Today]] | date=2008-06-22 | accessdate=2008-07-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706080444/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-06-22-marvel-magic_N.htm | archive-date=2008-07-06 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs a result, Pym was revived eight issues later as the costumed [[superhero]] '''Ant-Man''' who starred in the 13-page, three-chapter story \"Return of the Ant-Man/An Army of Ants/The Ant-Man's Revenge\" in ''Tales to Astonish'' #35 (Sept. 1962). The character's adventures became an ongoing feature in the title. Issue #44 (June 1963) featured the debut of his [[socialite]] girlfriend and laboratory assistant [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]]. Janet adopted the costumed identity of the Wasp, and co-starred in Pym's subsequent appearances in ''Tales to Astonish''. Wasp also on occasion acted as a framing-sequence host for backup stories in the title. In September 1963, Lee and Kirby created the superhero title ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', and Ant-Man and Wasp were established in issue #1 as founding members of the team.\n\nDecades later, Lee theorized as to why \"Ant-Man never became one of our top sellers or had his own book,\" saying,\n\n{{quote|I loved Ant-Man, but the stories were never really successful. In order for Ant-Man to be successful, he had to be drawn this small next to big things and you would be getting pictures that were visually interesting. The artists who drew him, no matter how much I kept reminding them, they kept forgetting that fact. They would draw him standing on a tabletop and they would draw a heroic-looking guy. I would say, 'Draw a matchbook cover next to him, so we see the difference in size.' But they kept forgetting. So when you would look at the panels, you thought you were looking at a normal guy wearing an underwear costume like all of them. It didn't have the interest.<ref>{{cite book | title = Stan Lee: Conversations |  first = Jeff, ed. | last = McLaughlin | publisher = [[University Press of Mississippi]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1578069859 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmB3GprtboC&pg=PA186&dq=%22ant-Man+certainly+wasn't%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RfiZUOT2GuH30gG4uYHgBQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22ant-Man%20certainly%20wasn't%22&f=false 186] }}</ref>}}\n\nPym began what would be a constant shifting of superhero identities in ''Tales to Astonish'', becoming the {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall '''Giant-Man''' in issue #49 (Nov. 1963).

Giant-Man appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' from issue #1 (Aug. 2010) through its final issue #39 (Jan. 2013).

He grew up in New York City and learned to draw cartoon figures by tracing characters from comic strips and editorial cartoons. He entered the nascent comics industry in the 1930s, drawing various comics features under different [[pen name]]s, including Jack Curtiss, before ultimately settling on Jack Kirby. In 1940, he and writer-editor [[Joe Simon]] created the highly successful [[superhero]] character [[Captain America]] for [[Timely Comics]], predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]]. During the 1940s, Kirby regularly teamed with Simon, creating numerous characters for that company and for [[National Comics Publications]], later to become [[DC Comics]].\n\nAfter serving in the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater]] in [[World War II]], Kirby produced work for DC Comics, [[Harvey Comics]], [[Hillman Periodicals]] and other publishers. At [[Crestwood Publications]], he and Simon created the genre of [[romance comics]] and later founded their own short-lived comic company, [[Mainline Publications]]. Kirby was involved in Timely's 1950s iteration, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], which in the next decade became Marvel. There, in the 1960s under writer-editor [[Stan Lee]], Kirby created many of the company's major characters, including the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[X-Men]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the [[Hulk]] and [[Iron Man]]. The Lee\u2013Kirby titles garnered high sales and critical acclaim, but in 1970, feeling he had been treated unfairly, largely in the realm of authorship credit and creators' rights, Kirby left the company for rival DC.\n\nAt DC, Kirby created his [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] saga which spanned several comics titles. While these series proved commercially unsuccessful and were canceled, the Fourth World's [[New Gods]] have continued as a significant part of the [[DC Universe]]. Kirby returned to Marvel briefly in the mid-to-late 1970s, then ventured into [[television animation]] and [[independent comics]]. In his later years, Kirby, who has been called \"the [[William Blake]] of comics\",<ref>{{Cite news |authorlink=Grant Morrison |last=Morrison |first=Grant |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/23/grant-morrison-supergods-superheroes |title=My Supergods from the Age of the Superhero |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London, United Kingdom |date=July 23, 2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224212935/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jul/23/grant-morrison-supergods-superheroes |archivedate=February 24, 2012 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> began receiving great recognition in the mainstream press for his career accomplishments, and in 1987 he was one of the three inaugural inductees of the [[The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]]. In 2017, Kirby was posthumously named a [[Disney Legend]] with Lee for their co-creations not only in the field of publishing, but also because those creations formed the basis for [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s financially and critically successful media franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].\n\nKirby was married to Rosalind Goldstein in 1942. They had four children and remained married until his death from heart failure in 1994, at the age of 76. The [[Jack Kirby Awards]] and [[Jack Kirby Hall of Fame]] were named in his honor, and he is known as \"'''The King'''\" among comics fans for his many influential contributions to the medium.\n\n==Early life (1917\u20131935)==\nJack Kirby was born '''Jacob Kurtzberg''' on August 28, 1917, at 147 [[Essex Street]] on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in New York City, where he was raised.<ref name=Kirbymuseum>{{cite web | url = http://kirbymuseum.org/biography | first= Mark | last= Evanier | authorlink = Mark Evanier | first2=Steve| last2=Sherman | title = Jack Kirby Biography | publisher = Jack Kirby Museum & Research Center | accessdate = February 24, 2012 | archivedate= September 17, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130917070658/http://kirbymuseum.org/biography/ | url-status=live|display-authors=etal| date= March 20, 2008 }}</ref> His parents, Rose (Bernstein) and Benjamin Kurtzberg,<ref name=Kirbymuseum/> were [[History of the Jews in Austria|Austrian-Jewish]] immigrants, and his father earned a living as a [[Clothing|garment]] factory worker.<ref name=hamilsue>Hamilton, Sue L.

(under the [[pseudonym]] '''Jack Curtiss'''). He remained until late 1939, when he began working for the movie [[animation]] company [[Fleischer Studios]] as an [[Inbetweening|inbetweener]] (an artist who fills in the action between major-movement frames) on ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'' cartoons at the same time in 1935. He left the Studio before the Fleischer strike in 1937.<ref name=\"Cartoon Research\">[https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/in-his-own-words-jack-kirby-at-fleischers/] at Cartoon Research.com.</ref> \"I went from Lincoln to Fleischer,\" he recalled. \"From Fleischer I had to get out in a hurry because I couldn't take that kind of thing,\" describing it as \"a factory in a sense, like my father's factory. They were manufacturing pictures.\"<ref name=\"cj\">Interview, ''The Comics Journal'' #134, reprinted in George, p. 24</ref>\n\nAround that time, the American comic book industry was booming. Kirby began writing and drawing for the comic-book packager [[Eisner & Iger]], one of a handful of firms creating comics on demand for publishers. Through that company, Kirby did what he remembers as his first comic book work, for ''Wild Boy Magazine''.<ref>Interview, ''The Nostalgia Journal'' #30, November 1976, reprinted in George, p. 3</ref> This included such strips as the science fiction adventure \"The Diary of Dr. Hayward\" (under the pseudonym '''Curt Davis'''), the [[Western comics|Western]] crimefighter feature \"Wilton of the West\" (as '''Fred Sande'''), the [[swashbuckler]] adventure \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" (again as Jack Curtiss), and the humor features \"Abdul Jones\" (as '''Ted Grey''') and \"Socko the Seadog\" (as '''Teddy'''), all variously for ''[[Jumbo Comics]]'' and other Eisner-Iger clients.<ref name=gcdjack>[https://www.comics.org/credit/name/Jack%20Kirby/sort/chrono/ Jack Kirby] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> He first used the surname Kirby as the pseudonymous '''Lance Kirby''' in two \"Lone Rider\" Western stories in [[Eastern Color Printing]]'s ''[[Famous Funnies]]'' #63\u201364 (Oct.\u2013Nov. 1939).<ref name=gcdjack /> He ultimately settled on the pen name Jack Kirby because it reminded him of actor [[James Cagney]]. However, he took offense to those who suggested he changed his name in order to hide his Jewish heritage.<ref>Jones, p. 197</ref>\n\n==Partnership with Joe Simon==\nKirby moved on to comic-book publisher and newspaper syndicator [[Fox Feature Syndicate]], earning a then-reasonable $15-a-week salary. He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip ''The [[Blue Beetle]]'', published from January to March 1940, starring a character created by the pseudonymous [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas]], a house name that Kirby retained for the three-month-long strip. During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor [[Joe Simon]], who in addition to his staff work continued to freelance. Simon recalled in 1988, \"I loved Jack's work and the first time I saw it I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He asked if we could do some freelance work together. I was delighted and I took him over to my little office. We worked from the second issue of [[Blue Bolt]] through ... about 25 years.\"<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/25simon.html |title=More Than Your Average Joe \u2013 Excerpts from Joe Simon's panels at the 1998 San Diego Comic-Con International |journal=The Jack Kirby Collector |number=25 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=August 1999 |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130191556/http://twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/25simon.html |archivedate=November 30, 2010 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Fox and collaborating on the premiere issue of [[Fawcett Comics]]' ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] Adventures'' ([March] 1941),<ref>[https://www.comics.org/issue/1178/ Captain Marvel Adventures #<nowiki>[1]</nowiki>] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> the first solo title for the previously introduced superhero, and for which Kirby was told to mimic creator [[C.C.

It has also been suggested that Kirby also drew from [[Burne Hogarth]], whose dynamic figure work may have informed the way Kirby drew figures; \"his ferocious bounding, and grotesquely articulated figures seem directly descended from Hogarth's dynamically contorted forms.\"<ref>Hatfield (2012), p. 61</ref> His style drew on these influences, all major artists at the time Kirby was learning his craft, with Caniff, Foster and Raymond between them imparting to the sequential adventure comic strip a highly illustrative approach based on realising the setting to a very high degree. Where Kirby diverged from these influences, and where his style impacted on the formation of comic book art, was in his move away from an illustrated approach to one that was more dynamic. Kirby's artistic style was one that captured energy and motion within the image, synergizing with the text and helping to serve the narrative. In contrast, successors to the illustrative approach, such as [[Gil Kane]], found their work eventually reach an impasse. The art would illustrate, but in lacking movement caused the reader to contemplate the art as much as the written word. Later artists such as [[Bryan Hitch]] and [[Alex Ross]] combined the Kirby and Kane approaches, using highly realistic backgrounds contrasted with dynamic characters to create what became known as a widescreen approach to comics.<ref>Hatfield (2012), p. 63-65</ref>\n\nKirby's dynamism and energy served to push the reader through the story where an illustrative, detailed approach would cause the eye to linger.<ref>Hatfield (2012), p. 65-67</ref> His reduction of the presentation of a given scene down to one that represents the semblance of movement has led Kirby to be described as cinematic in his style.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hatfield |first1=Charles |title=Alternative comics : an emerging literature |date=2005 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, Miss. |isbn=1578067197 |page=54 |edition= 1st}}</ref> Having worked at [[Fleischer Studios]] before coming to comics, Kirby had a grounding in animation techniques for producing motion. He also realised that comic books weren't subject to the same constraints as the newspaper strip. While other comic book artists recreated the layouts that format used, Kirby swiftly utilised the space a whole comic book page created.<ref name=RC /> As Ron Goulart describes, \"(h)e broke up the pages in new ways and introduced splash panels that stretched across two pages.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goulart |first1=Ron |title=The great comic book artists |date=1986 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0312345577 |page=56 |edition= 1st}}</ref> Kirby himself described the creation of his dynamic style as a reaction both to the cinema and to the urge to create and compete: I found myself competing with the movie camera. I had to compete with the camera. I felt like [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] ... I tore my characters out of the panels. I made them jump all over the page.

Using this definition, Kirby's view and depiction of technology is that of it as something to be feared.<ref>Hatfield (2012) p.144-71</ref>\n\n===Working method===\n[[File:The_Demon_issue_1_splash.jpg|thumb|right|Jack Kirby's pencils for the splash page to ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'' #1 [[DC Comics]] (September 1972). The detailed pencil work Kirby created can be seen in this art]]\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, Kirby did not use preliminary sketches, rough work or layouts. He would instead start with the blank board and draw the story onto the page from top to bottom, start to finish. Many artists, including [[Carmine Infantino]], Gil Kane and [[Jim Steranko]] have remarked on the unusual nature of his method. Kirby would rarely erase while working, the art, and therefore the story, would flow from him almost fully formed.<ref>Hatfield, p. 58</ref> Kirby's pencils had a reputation for being detailed, to the point that they were difficult to ink.<ref>{{Citation|title=Walt Simonson Interviewed|editor=Morrow, John|isbn=1893905020|magazine=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=2004|volume=3|page=112|quote= ... it's so powerful in pencil, it's really hard to ink it and really retain the full flavour of the pencils.

Instead the pencilled pages were sent on to an inker. Different inkers would therefore impact on the published version of Kirby's art, with Kirby himself noting that individual inkers were suited to different genres.<ref name=ink>Interview, ''The Nostalgia Journal'' #30\u20131, November 1976 \u2013 December 1976, reprinted in George, p. 10</ref> For a period during the 1950s, when work had dried up, it's been suggested by Harry Mendryk that Kirby inked himself.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mendryk |first1=Harry |title=Jack Kirby's Austere Inking, Chapter 1, Introduction |url=http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/simonandkirby/archives/824 |website=Jack Kirby Museum & Research Center |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=April 7, 2007}}</ref> By the late 1960s, Kirby preferred to pencil, feeling that \"inking in itself is a separate kind of art.\"<ref name=ink /> [[Stan Lee]] recalls Kirby not really being too interested in who inked him: \"I cared much more about who inked Kirby than Kirby did ... Kirby never seemed to care who inked him ... I think Kirby felt his style was so strong that it just didn't matter who inked him\".<ref>{{cite journal |editor1-last=Thomas |editor1-first=Roy |editor1-link=Roy Thomas |title=The Retrospective Stan Lee |journal=Alter Ego |date=2017 |issue=150 |page=13 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing}}</ref> [[Chic Stone]], an inker of Kirby's during the 1960s at Marvel, recalled \"(T)he two best [inkers] for Jack were [[Mike Royer]] and [[Steve Rude]]. Both truly maintained the integrity of Jack's pencils.\"<ref>Morrow, p. 90</ref>\n\nThe size of the [[Bristol board|art board]] made a difference to Kirby's style. During the late 1960s the industry shrunk the size of the art board artists used. Prior to 1967, art boards were around 14 x 21 inches, being reproduced at 7 x 10 inches. After 1967 the size of the board shrunk to 15 x 10.<ref>Hatfield & Saunders, p. 36-7</ref> This affected the way Kirby drew. Gil Kane noted that \"the amount of space around the figures became less and less ... The figures became bigger and bigger, and they couldn't be contained by a single panel or even a single page\".<ref>Hatfield & Saunders, p. 28</ref> Professor Craig Fischer asserts Kirby at first \"hated\" the new size.<ref name=\"Hatfield & Saunders, p. 37\">Hatfield & Saunders, p. 37</ref> Fischer argues that it took Kirby around 18 months to negotiate a way of working at the smaller size. Initially he retreated to a less detailed, close up style, as seen in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #68. In adjusting to the new size, Kirby began utilising depth to bring the pages to life, increasing his use of foreshortening.<ref name=\"Hatfield & Saunders, p. 37\"/> By the time Kirby had moved to DC, he started to incorporate the use of two page spreads into his art more. These spreads helped define the mood of the story, and came to define Kirby's late era work.<ref>Hatfield & Saunders, p. 149-157</ref>\n\n===Exhibitions and original art===\nKirby's art has been exhibited as part of the Masters of American Comics joint exhibition by [[The Hammer Museum]] and [[The Museum of Contemporary Art]] from November 2005 to March 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Masters of American Comics|url=https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2005/masters-of-american-comics/|publisher=[[The Hammer Museum]]|accessdate=May 31, 2018|archivedate=June 9, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180609221650/https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2005/masters-of-american-comics/|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2015 Charles Hatfield curated the \"Comic Book Apocalypse\" exhibition at the [[California State University, Northridge]] Art Galleries.

Work created around [[World War II]] would have been reused or pulped due to paper shortages. [[DC Comics]] had a policy of destroying original art in the 1950s. [[Marvel Comics]] would also destroy art, up until 1960, when it stored artwork prior to a policy which saw art returned to the artist. In Kirby's case, it's reported he was returned roughly 2100 pieces of the estimated 10,000 pages drawn.

\"'''Kirby'''\" '''Kurtzberg''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u025cr|t|s|b|\u025cr|g}}; August 28, 1917 \u2013 February 6, 1994) was an American [[comics artist|comic book artist]], writer and editor, widely regarded as one of the medium's major innovators and one of its most prolific and influential creators. He grew up in New York City and learned to draw cartoon figures by tracing characters from comic strips and editorial cartoons. He entered the nascent comics industry in the 1930s, drawing various comics features under different [[pen name]]s, including Jack Curtiss, before ultimately settling on Jack Kirby. In 1940, he and writer-editor [[Joe Simon]] created the highly successful [[superhero]] character [[Captain America]] for [[Timely Comics]], predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]]. During the 1940s, Kirby regularly teamed with Simon, creating numerous characters for that company and for [[National Comics Publications]], later to become [[DC Comics]].\n\nAfter serving in the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater]] in [[World War II]], Kirby produced work for DC Comics, [[Harvey Comics]], [[Hillman Periodicals]] and other publishers. At [[Crestwood Publications]], he and Simon created the genre of [[romance comics]] and later founded their own short-lived comic company, [[Mainline Publications]]. Kirby was involved in Timely's 1950s iteration, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], which in the next decade became Marvel. There, in the 1960s under writer-editor [[Stan Lee]], Kirby created many of the company's major characters, including the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[X-Men]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the [[Hulk]] and [[Iron Man]]. The Lee\u2013Kirby titles garnered high sales and critical acclaim, but in 1970, feeling he had been treated unfairly, largely in the realm of authorship credit and creators' rights, Kirby left the company for rival DC.\n\nAt DC, Kirby created his [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] saga which spanned several comics titles. While these series proved commercially unsuccessful and were canceled, the Fourth World's [[New Gods]] have continued as a significant part of the [[DC Universe]]. Kirby returned to Marvel briefly in the mid-to-late 1970s, then ventured into [[television animation]] and [[independent comics]]. In his later years, Kirby, who has been called \"the [[William Blake]] of comics\",<ref>{{Cite news |authorlink=Grant Morrison |last=Morrison |first=Grant |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/23/grant-morrison-supergods-superheroes |title=My Supergods from the Age of the Superhero |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London, United Kingdom |date=July 23, 2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224212935/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jul/23/grant-morrison-supergods-superheroes |archivedate=February 24, 2012 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> began receiving great recognition in the mainstream press for his career accomplishments, and in 1987 he was one of the three inaugural inductees of the [[The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]]. In 2017, Kirby was posthumously named a [[Disney Legend]] with Lee for their co-creations not only in the field of publishing, but also because those creations formed the basis for [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s financially and critically successful media franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].\n\nKirby was married to Rosalind Goldstein in 1942. They had four children and remained married until his death from heart failure in 1994, at the age of 76. The [[Jack Kirby Awards]] and [[Jack Kirby Hall of Fame]] were named in his honor, and he is known as \"'''The King'''\" among comics fans for his many influential contributions to the medium.\n\n==Early life (1917\u20131935)==\nJack Kirby was born '''Jacob Kurtzberg''' on August 28, 1917, at 147 [[Essex Street]] on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in New York City, where he was raised.<ref name=Kirbymuseum>{{cite web | url = http://kirbymuseum.org/biography | first= Mark | last= Evanier | authorlink = Mark Evanier | first2=Steve| last2=Sherman | title = Jack Kirby Biography | publisher = Jack Kirby Museum & Research Center | accessdate = February 24, 2012 | archivedate= September 17, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130917070658/http://kirbymuseum.org/biography/ | url-status=live|display-authors=etal| date= March 20, 2008 }}</ref> His parents, Rose (Bernstein) and Benjamin Kurtzberg,<ref name=Kirbymuseum/> were [[History of the Jews in Austria|Austrian-Jewish]] immigrants, and his father earned a living as a [[Clothing|garment]] factory worker.<ref name=hamilsue>Hamilton, Sue L.

(under the [[pseudonym]] '''Jack Curtiss'''). He remained until late 1939, when he began working for the movie [[animation]] company [[Fleischer Studios]] as an [[Inbetweening|inbetweener]] (an artist who fills in the action between major-movement frames) on ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'' cartoons at the same time in 1935. He left the Studio before the Fleischer strike in 1937.<ref name=\"Cartoon Research\">[https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/in-his-own-words-jack-kirby-at-fleischers/] at Cartoon Research.com.</ref> \"I went from Lincoln to Fleischer,\" he recalled. \"From Fleischer I had to get out in a hurry because I couldn't take that kind of thing,\" describing it as \"a factory in a sense, like my father's factory. They were manufacturing pictures.\"<ref name=\"cj\">Interview, ''The Comics Journal'' #134, reprinted in George, p. 24</ref>\n\nAround that time, the American comic book industry was booming. Kirby began writing and drawing for the comic-book packager [[Eisner & Iger]], one of a handful of firms creating comics on demand for publishers. Through that company, Kirby did what he remembers as his first comic book work, for ''Wild Boy Magazine''.<ref>Interview, ''The Nostalgia Journal'' #30, November 1976, reprinted in George, p. 3</ref> This included such strips as the science fiction adventure \"The Diary of Dr. Hayward\" (under the pseudonym '''Curt Davis'''), the [[Western comics|Western]] crimefighter feature \"Wilton of the West\" (as '''Fred Sande'''), the [[swashbuckler]] adventure \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" (again as Jack Curtiss), and the humor features \"Abdul Jones\" (as '''Ted Grey''') and \"Socko the Seadog\" (as '''Teddy'''), all variously for ''[[Jumbo Comics]]'' and other Eisner-Iger clients.<ref name=gcdjack>[https://www.comics.org/credit/name/Jack%20Kirby/sort/chrono/ Jack Kirby] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> He first used the surname Kirby as the pseudonymous '''Lance Kirby''' in two \"Lone Rider\" Western stories in [[Eastern Color Printing]]'s ''[[Famous Funnies]]'' #63\u201364 (Oct.\u2013Nov. 1939).<ref name=gcdjack /> He ultimately settled on the pen name Jack Kirby because it reminded him of actor [[James Cagney]]. However, he took offense to those who suggested he changed his name in order to hide his Jewish heritage.<ref>Jones, p. 197</ref>\n\n==Partnership with Joe Simon==\nKirby moved on to comic-book publisher and newspaper syndicator [[Fox Feature Syndicate]], earning a then-reasonable $15-a-week salary. He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip ''The [[Blue Beetle]]'', published from January to March 1940, starring a character created by the pseudonymous [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas]], a house name that Kirby retained for the three-month-long strip. During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor [[Joe Simon]], who in addition to his staff work continued to freelance. Simon recalled in 1988, \"I loved Jack's work and the first time I saw it I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He asked if we could do some freelance work together. I was delighted and I took him over to my little office.

It has also been suggested that Kirby also drew from [[Burne Hogarth]], whose dynamic figure work may have informed the way Kirby drew figures; \"his ferocious bounding, and grotesquely articulated figures seem directly descended from Hogarth's dynamically contorted forms.\"<ref>Hatfield (2012), p. 61</ref> His style drew on these influences, all major artists at the time Kirby was learning his craft, with Caniff, Foster and Raymond between them imparting to the sequential adventure comic strip a highly illustrative approach based on realising the setting to a very high degree. Where Kirby diverged from these influences, and where his style impacted on the formation of comic book art, was in his move away from an illustrated approach to one that was more dynamic. Kirby's artistic style was one that captured energy and motion within the image, synergizing with the text and helping to serve the narrative. In contrast, successors to the illustrative approach, such as [[Gil Kane]], found their work eventually reach an impasse. The art would illustrate, but in lacking movement caused the reader to contemplate the art as much as the written word. Later artists such as [[Bryan Hitch]] and [[Alex Ross]] combined the Kirby and Kane approaches, using highly realistic backgrounds contrasted with dynamic characters to create what became known as a widescreen approach to comics.<ref>Hatfield (2012), p. 63-65</ref>\n\nKirby's dynamism and energy served to push the reader through the story where an illustrative, detailed approach would cause the eye to linger.<ref>Hatfield (2012), p. 65-67</ref> His reduction of the presentation of a given scene down to one that represents the semblance of movement has led Kirby to be described as cinematic in his style.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hatfield |first1=Charles |title=Alternative comics : an emerging literature |date=2005 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, Miss. |isbn=1578067197 |page=54 |edition= 1st}}</ref> Having worked at [[Fleischer Studios]] before coming to comics, Kirby had a grounding in animation techniques for producing motion. He also realised that comic books weren't subject to the same constraints as the newspaper strip. While other comic book artists recreated the layouts that format used, Kirby swiftly utilised the space a whole comic book page created.<ref name=RC /> As Ron Goulart describes, \"(h)e broke up the pages in new ways and introduced splash panels that stretched across two pages.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goulart |first1=Ron |title=The great comic book artists |date=1986 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0312345577 |page=56 |edition= 1st}}</ref> Kirby himself described the creation of his dynamic style as a reaction both to the cinema and to the urge to create and compete: I found myself competing with the movie camera. I had to compete with the camera. I felt like [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] ... I tore my characters out of the panels. I made them jump all over the page.

Kirby and Simon created the [[romance comics]] genre, and working in this as well as the war, Western and crime genres saw Kirby's style change. He left behind the diverse panel framing and layouts. The nature of these genres enabled him to channel the energy into the posing and blocking of characters, forcing the drama into the constraints of the panel.<ref name=\"Hatfield & Saunders, p. 11\"/>\n\nWhen Kirby and [[Stan Lee]] came together at [[Marvel Comics]], his art developed again.

He would instead start with the blank board and draw the story onto the page from top to bottom, start to finish.

Instead the pencilled pages were sent on to an inker. Different inkers would therefore impact on the published version of Kirby's art, with Kirby himself noting that individual inkers were suited to different genres.<ref name=ink>Interview, ''The Nostalgia Journal'' #30\u20131, November 1976 \u2013 December 1976, reprinted in George, p. 10</ref> For a period during the 1950s, when work had dried up, it's been suggested by Harry Mendryk that Kirby inked himself.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mendryk |first1=Harry |title=Jack Kirby's Austere Inking, Chapter 1, Introduction |url=http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/simonandkirby/archives/824 |website=Jack Kirby Museum & Research Center |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=April 7, 2007}}</ref> By the late 1960s, Kirby preferred to pencil, feeling that \"inking in itself is a separate kind of art.\"<ref name=ink /> [[Stan Lee]] recalls Kirby not really being too interested in who inked him: \"I cared much more about who inked Kirby than Kirby did ...

During the late 1960s the industry shrunk the size of the art board artists used. Prior to 1967, art boards were around 14 x 21 inches, being reproduced at 7 x 10 inches. After 1967 the size of the board shrunk to 15 x 10.<ref>Hatfield & Saunders, p. 36-7</ref> This affected the way Kirby drew. Gil Kane noted that \"the amount of space around the figures became less and less ... The figures became bigger and bigger, and they couldn't be contained by a single panel or even a single page\".<ref>Hatfield & Saunders, p. 28</ref> Professor Craig Fischer asserts Kirby at first \"hated\" the new size.<ref name=\"Hatfield & Saunders, p. 37\">Hatfield & Saunders, p. 37</ref> Fischer argues that it took Kirby around 18 months to negotiate a way of working at the smaller size. Initially he retreated to a less detailed, close up style, as seen in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #68. In adjusting to the new size, Kirby began utilising depth to bring the pages to life, increasing his use of foreshortening.<ref name=\"Hatfield & Saunders, p. 37\"/> By the time Kirby had moved to DC, he started to incorporate the use of two page spreads into his art more.

The highest point in the province is exactly on the border with [[Hungary]], on the [[Geschriebenstein]], {{convert|884|m|ft}} above sea level.  The highest point entirely within Burgenland is 879 metres above sea level; the lowest point (which is also the lowest point of [[Austria]]) at {{convert|114|m|ft}}, is in the municipal area of [[Apetlon]].\n\nBurgenland borders the Austrian state of [[Styria]] to the southwest, and the state of [[Lower Austria]] to the northwest. To the east it borders [[Hungary]] ([[Vas County]] and [[Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron County]]). In the extreme north and south there are short borders with [[Slovakia]] ([[Bratislava Region]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Mura Statistical Region]]) respectively.\n\nBurgenland and Hungary share the [[Neusiedler See]] (Hungarian: ''Fert\u0151 t\u00f3''), a lake known for its reeds and shallowness, as well as its mild climate throughout the year. The Neusiedler See is Austria's largest lake, and is a great tourist attraction, bringing ornithologists, sailors, and wind and kite surfers into the region north of the lake.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|2020 Burgenland state election}}\nBurgenland's state assembly ''([[Landtag]])'' has 36 seats. At the election held on [[2020 Burgenland state election|26 January 2020]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SP\u00d6) won an [[absolute majority]] of 19 seats, the [[Austrian People's Party]] (\u00d6VP) won 11 seats, the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FP\u00d6) won 4 seats and the [[Austrian Green Party|Green Party]] won 2 seats. The provincial government for the 2015\u20132020 term is a coalition of the SP\u00d6 and the FP\u00d6. The [[voting age]] for regional elections in Burgenland was reduced to 16 in 2003.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the state was 9 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 2.3% of the Austria's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 27,300 \u20ac or 90% of the EU27 average in the same year. Burgenland is the state with the lowest GDP per capita in Austria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nBurgenland consists of nine [[districts of Austria|districts]], two [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory cities]] and seven rural districts.

During Roman administration, it was part of the province of [[Pannonia]], and later part of the provinces of [[Pannonia Superior]] (in the 2nd century) and [[Pannonia Prima]] (in the 3rd century). During the late Roman Empire, Pannonia Prima province was part of larger administrative units, such are [[Diocese of Pannonia]], [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]] and [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy]].\n\n=== Early Germanic states ===\n[[File:MajorianEmpire.png|thumb|300px|right|The Ostrogothic Kingdom in Pannonia]]\nThe first [[Germanic people]] to settle in this region were the [[Ostrogoths]], who came to Pannonia in AD 380. The Ostrogoths became allies of [[Rome]] and were allowed to settle in Pannonia, being tasked to defend the [[Limes (Roman Empire)|Roman borders]]. In the 5th century, the area was conquered by the [[Huns]], but after their defeat, an independent Kingdom of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia was formed. The territory of present-day Burgenland became part of the Italian [[Kingdom of Odoacer]], but at the end of the 5th century the Ostrogothic king [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] conquered this kingdom and restored Ostrogothic administration in western Pannonia.\n\nIn the 6th century, the territory was included in another Germanic state, the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]]. However, the Lombards subsequently left towards [[Italy]] and the area came under the control of the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]]. Briefly in the 7th century, the area was part of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] State of [[Samo]], but was subsequently returned to Avar control. After the Avar defeat at the end of the 8th century, the area became part of the [[Frankish Empire]]. After the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] (or [[Augsburg]]) in 955, new [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] settlers came to the area.<ref name=\"Fischer2011\">{{cite book|author=Henry A.

On 20 September 1058 Agnes of Poitou and [[Andrew I of Hungary]], whose son later married a daughter of Agnes of Poitou, met to negotiate the border.<ref>Landeschronik Nieder\u00f6sterreich: 3000 Jahre in Daten, Dokumenten und Bildern, Seite 104, Karl Gutkas, C. Brandst\u00e4tter, 1990.</ref> The area of Burgenland remained the western border-zone of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary until the 16th century.\n\nThe majority of the population was Germanic, except for the Hungarian border-guards of the frontier March (''[[Gyep\u0171]]''). Germanic immigration from neighbouring Austria was also continuous in the Middle Ages.\n\n===Habsburg administration===\n[[File:Habsburg mortgages between 15th and 17th centuries.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Habsburg mortgages in Burgenland between the 15th and 17th centuries]]\nIn 1440 the territory of present-day Burgenland was controlled by the Habsburgs of Austria, and in 1463 the northern part of it (with the town of [[K\u0151szeg]]) became a mortgage-territory according to the peace treaty of [[Wiener Neustadt]]. In 1477 King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of Hungary had retaken the area, but in 1491 it was mortgaged again by King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary]] to Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. In 1647 Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] returned it to the Kingdom of Hungary (which itself was a Habsburg possession in this time).\n\nIn the 16th century, the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] lost its independence and its north-western part that was not conquered by the Ottoman Empire was included in the Habsburg Empire. This Habsburg possession was known as [[Royal Hungary]] and it included territory of present-day Burgenland and western Hungary. [[Royal Hungary]] still had counties. What is today Burgenland was in those times the Moson, Sopron and Vas counties of Hungary.\n[[File:Central europe 1572.png|thumb|The Kingdom of Hungary as divided into 3 parts]]\n\nIn the 16-17th centuries German [[Protestant]] refugees arrived in Western Royal Hungary to shelter from [[European wars of religion|the religious wars]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], particularly from the suppression of the Reformation in Austrian territories, then ruled by the staunchly Roman Catholic Habsburgs. After the Habsburg military victory against the Ottomans at the end of the 17th century, the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary was enlarged to include much of the territory of the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary. In the 17th and 18th centuries the region of Western Hungary was dominated by the wealthy Catholic landowning families, for example the [[House of Esterh\u00e1zy|Esterh\u00e1zys]] and [[Batthy\u00e1ny]]s. In 1867, the Habsburg Empire was transformed into the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.\n\n===Dissolution of Austria-Hungary===\nAccording to the 1910 census 291,800 people lived on the territory of present-day Burgenland. Among them 217,072 were German-speaking (74%), 43,633 Croatian-speaking (15%) and 26,225 (9%) Hungarian-speaking. [[Romani people|Roma people]] were counted according to their native language.\n\nIn December 1918, the [[Republic of Heinzenland]] was declared by Austrian politician [[Hans Suchard]] with the goal to eventually annex the territory into Austria. However, it was taken over within 2 days by Hungary.\n\nFrom March to August 1919, the Burgenland was part of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].\n\nThe area had also been discussed as the site of a [[Czech Corridor]] to Yugoslavia. The decision on \"German West Hungary\" (''Deutsch-Westungarn'') was fixed in the treaties of [[Treaty of Saint Germain|Saint Germain]] and [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]]. Despite diplomatic efforts by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], the victorious parties of World War I set the date of Burgenland's official unification with Austria for 28 August 1921. However, on that day sharpshooters with the support of Hungary prevented the establishment of Austrian police control and customs. [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[P\u00e1l Pr\u00f3nay]] and his men, the [[Rongyos G\u00e1rda]], defended western Hungary from occupation by Austrian officials and forces of the Austrian [[Gendarmerie (Austria)|Gendarmerie]]. Pr\u00f3nay had help from Hungarians and Croatians who did not want to live under Austrian rule, leading to the [[Uprising in West Hungary]] in 1921. Pr\u00f3nay occupied the whole area and created the state of [[Lajtab\u00e1ns\u00e1g]]. In 1921, general elections were held in the area. Sopron and 8 other villages voted to stay in Hungary. The other areas were handed over to Austria, to form the Austrian province of Burgenland.\n\n=== Ninth state of Austria ===\n[[File:Austria 25 Schilling 1961 Silver Coin Burgenland.jpg|left|thumb|Austrian 25-[[Austrian schilling|schilling]] silver coin (1961): ''40 years of Burgenland in Austria.'' It shows the Haydnkirche in the capital Eisenstadt.]]\nWith the help of Italian diplomatic mediation in the [[Venice Protocol]], the crisis was almost resolved in the autumn of 1921, when Hungary committed to disarm the sharpshooters by 6 November 1921. This was in exchange for a plebiscite on the unification of certain territories, including \u00d6denburg ([[Sopron]]), the designated capital of Burgenland, and eight surrounding villages. The vote took place from 14 to 16 December, and resulted in a clear (but doubted by Austria){{citation needed|date=January 2013}} vote of the people who inhabited the Sopron district to be part of Hungary. Consequently, the territory was incorporated into Austria, except for the Sopron district which was united with Hungary.\n[[File:Krensdorf-Tormafalu-war memorial.jpg|thumb|A memorial in [[Krensdorf]] to soldiers who died in the two World Wars]]\nIn contrast to all the other present Austrian states, which had been part of [[Cisleithania]], Burgenland did not constitute a specific ''[[Crown Land|Kronland]]'', and when it was formed it did not have its own regional political and administrative institutions such as a ''[[Landtag]]'' (representative assembly) and ''[[Statthalter]]'' (imperial governor).\n\nOn 18 July 1922, the first elections for the parliament of Burgenland took place. Various interim arrangements were required due to the changeover from Hungarian to Austrian jurisdiction. The parliament decided in 1925 on [[Eisenstadt]] as the capital of Burgenland, and moved from the various provisional estates throughout the country to the newly built ''Landhaus'' in 1929.\n\nThe first Austrian census in 1923 registered 285,600 people in Burgenland. The ethnic composition of the province had changed slightly: the percentage of Germans increased compared to 1910 (227,869 people, 80%) while the percentage of Hungarians rapidly declined (14,931 people, 5%). This was due mainly to the emigration of the Hungarian civil servants and intellectuals after the territory was ceded to Austria.\n\nIn 1923, emigration to the [[United States|United States of America]], which started in the late 19th century, reached its climax; in some places up to a quarter of the population went overseas.\n\nAfter the [[Nazi German]] ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria, the administrative unit of Burgenland was dissolved. Northern and central Burgenland joined the district of Niederdonau (Lower Danube) while southern Burgenland joined [[Steiermark]] (Styria).{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Jews of Burgenland were forced to emigrate in the immediate aftermath of the ''Anschluss''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zalmon |first1=Milka |title=Forced Emigration of the Jews of Burgenland |journal=Yad Vashem Studies |date=2003 |volume=XXXI |pages=287-324 |url=https://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%207002.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe policy of [[Germanization]] also affected other minorities, especially [[Burgenland Croats]] and Hungarians. Minority schools were closed and the use of their native language discouraged.\n\nIn 1944, the Nazis began to build the ''[[South-east wall|S\u00fcdostwall]]'' (South-east wall) with the help of mostly Jewish forced labor and collaborating inhabitants. This proved to be utterly useless when Soviet troops crossed the Hungarian\u2013Austrian border during and [[Soviet invasion of Austria|invaded Austria]]. In the last days of the Nazi regime many executions and death marches of Jewish forced laborers took place.\n\n=== Occupation ===\n[[File:Austria 1945-55.svg|thumb|300px|right|Burgenland under Soviet administration, 1945-1955]]\nAs of 1 October 1945 Burgenland was reestablished with Soviet support and given to the Soviet forces in exchange for [[Steiermark]] (Styria), which was in turn occupied by the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nUnder Soviet occupation, people in Burgenland had to endure a period of serious mistreatment and an extremely slow economic progress, the latter induced by the investor-discouraging presence of Soviet troops. The Soviet occupation ended with the signing of the [[Austrian Independence Treaty]] of [[Vienna]] in 1955 by the Occupying Forces.\n\nThe brutally crushed [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungarian Revolution]] on 23 October 1956 resulted in a wave of Hungarian refugees at the Hungarian-Austrian border, especially at the Andau Bridge ([[Br\u00fccke von Andau]]). They were received by the inhabitants of Burgenland with an overwhelming amount of hospitality.\n\nIn 1957, the construction of the \"anti-Fascist Protective Barrier\" resulted in a complete sealing off of the area under Soviet influence from the rest of the world, turning the Hungarian-Austrian border next to Burgenland into a deadly zone of minefields and barbed wire (on the Hungarian side of the border), referred to as the [[Iron Curtain]]. Even during the era of the Iron Curtain, local trains between the north and south of Burgenland operated as \"[[Korridorzug|corridor train]]s\" (''Korridorz\u00fcge'') &ndash; they had their doors locked as they crossed through Hungarian territory.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1971, the minefields were cleared because people were often harmed by them,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} even on the Austrian side of the border. This could well be taken as a sign of the Soviet Union leaning towards opening the borders to the West starting in the late 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n=== Recent history ===\n[[File:Centrope_Map.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Burgenland is part of [[Centrope]], a project establishing a multinational region in four [[Central Europe]]an states: [[Slovakia]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]] and the [[Czech Republic]].|right]]\nDespite Burgenland (especially the area around the [[Neusiedler See]]) always producing excellent wine, some vintners in Burgenland [[1985 Diethylene Glycol Wine Scandal|added illegal substances to their wine]] in the mid-1980s. When this was revealed, Austria's wine exports dwindled dramatically. After recovering from the scandal, vintners in Austria, and not only in Burgenland, started focusing on quality and mostly stopped producing low-quality wine.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nOn 27 July 1989, the [[Foreign minister]]s of Austria and Hungary, [[Alois Mock]] and [[Gyula Horn]], cut the [[Iron Curtain]] (in [[German language|German]]: \"Eiserner Vorhang\") in the village of [[Klingenbach]] in a symbolic act with far-reaching consequences. At the same time, the border crossing at Nickelsdorf (Austria) / Hegyeshalom (Hungary) was opened by the Hungarian border patrol and this enabled the escape of East Germans. Directly behind the wires special medic troops of the Austrian Red Cross awaited them and provided first assistance. Thousands of [[East Germany|East Germans]] used this possibility to flee to the West. Again, the inhabitants of Burgenland received them with great hospitality. Later, this was often referred to as the beginning of [[German reunification]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nAfter 1990 Burgenland regained its traditional role as a bridge between the western and eastern parts of [[Central Europe]]. In 2003 it joined an [[Interreg]] project [[Centrope]]. Cross-border links were further strengthened when [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]] joined the [[European Union]] in 2004. All three countries became part of the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen zone]] in late 2007, and border controls finally ceased to exist in the region.\n\n== Minorities ==\nBurgenland has notable [[Burgenland Croats|Croatian]] (29,000\u201345,000) and [[Hungarians in Austria|Hungarian]] (5,000\u201315,000) populations.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Croats===\n{{main|Burgenland Croats}}\nThe Croats arrived after the devastating [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] war in 1532, when the Ottoman army destroyed some settlements in their ethnic territory. The emigration in great haste of the Catholic remained population of western [[Slavonia]] into the Burgenland was \u2013 as far as possible \u2013 organized by the estate owners. The archives of the [[Sabor]] (the Croatian parliament) from this period contain numerous references to such resettlements. As reported in the spring of 1538 by the [[Ban of Croatia]], Petar [[House of Keglevi\u0107|Keglevi\u0107]], who himself owned large estates in western Slavonia, that the country's population at the Ottoman border was preparing to emigrate.<ref>K\u00f6lner geographische Arbeiten, Ausgaben 15\u201318, Seite 69, Geographisches Institut der Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln, 1963</ref> Their resettlement by estate owners was finished only in 1584. They have preserved their strong Catholic faith and their language until today, and in the 19th century their national identity grew stronger because of the influence of the National Revival in Croatia. Between 1918 and 1921 Croats opposed the planned annexation of West-Hungary to Austria, and in 1923 seven Croatian villages voted for a return to Hungary. The Croatian Cultural Association of Burgenland was established in 1934. In the Nazi era (1938\u201345) the Croatian language was officially prohibited, and the state pursued an aggressive policy of Germanization. The [[Austrian State Treaty]] of 1955 guaranteed minority rights for every native ethnic minority in Austria but Croats had to fight for the use of their language in schools and offices even in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2000 51 new bilingual village name signs were erected in Burgenland (47 Croatian and 4 Hungarian).\n\nThe [[Burgenland Croatian language]] is an interesting 16th century dialect which is different from standard Croatian. In minority schools and media the local dialect is used, and it has had a written form since the 17th century (the Gospel was first translated to this dialect in 1711). Today the language is endangered by assimilation, according to the UNESCO's [[Red Book of Endangered Languages]]. The Croats of Burgenland belong to the same group as their relatives on the other side of the modern-day border with Hungary.\n\n===Hungarians===\nHungarians live in the villages of [[Oberwart]]/Fels\u0151\u0151r, [[Unterwart]]/Als\u00f3\u0151r  and [[Siget in der Wart]]/\u0150risziget. The three villages together are called [[Upper \u0150rs\u00e9g]] (Hun: ''Fels\u0151-\u0150rs\u00e9g'', German: ''Wart''), and they have formed a language island since the 11th century. The other old Hungarian language island in [[Oberpullendorf]]/Fels\u0151pulya has almost disappeared today. The Hungarians of Burgenland were \"''\u0151r\u00f6k''\", i.e. guards of the western frontier, and their special dialect is similar to the [[Sz\u00e9kely]]s in Transylvania. Their cultural centre is Oberwart/Fels\u0151\u0151r. Another distinct Hungarian group were the indentured agricultural workers living on the huge estates north of Neusiedler See. They arrived mainly from the [[R\u00e1bak\u00f6z]] region. After the dissolution of the manors in the mid-20th century this group ceased to exist.\n\n===Roma and Jews===\nIn addition to Germans, Croats and Hungarians, Burgenland used to have substantial Roma and Jewish populations, but these were wiped out by the Nazi regime. Before their deportation during 1938, the traditionally very religious Burgenland Jews were concentrated in the famous \"Seven Communities\" ([[Siebengemeinden]]/Sheva kehillot) in [[Eisenstadt]], [[Mattersburg]], [[Kittsee]], [[Frauenkirchen]], [[Kobersdorf]], [[Lackenbach]] and [[Deutschkreutz]], where they formed a substantial part of the population: e.g. in Lackenbach, 62% of the population was Jewish as of 1869{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. After the war, Jews from Burgenland founded the Jerusalem [[haredi]] neighbourhood of [[Kiryat Mattersdorf]], reminding of the original name of Mattersburg, once a centre of a famous yeshiva.\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Croatian language|Croatian]], it is known as ''Gradi\u0161\u0107e''; in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''\u0150rvid\u00e9k'', ''Fels\u0151\u0151rvid\u00e9k'' or ''V\u00e1rvid\u00e9k''; in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] as ''Gradi\u0161\u010danska''; and in the [[Prekmurje dialect]] as ''Gradi\u0161\u010de''.\n\nAs the region was not a territorial entity before 1921, it never had an official name. Until the end of [[World War I]] the German-speaking western borderland of the Kingdom of Hungary was sometimes unofficially called ''Deutsch-Westungarn'' (German West Hungary). The historical region included the border city of [[Sopron]] in Hungary (known as \u00d6denburg in German).\n\nThe name '''Vierburgenland''' (Land of Four Castles) was created in 1919 by Odo R\u00f6tig, a Viennese resident in Sopron. It was derived from the name of the four ''v\u00e1rmegye'' of the Kingdom of Hungary (in German ''Komitate'', 'counties') known in Hungarian as [[Pozsony County|Pozsony]], [[Moson County|Moson]], [[Sopron County|Sopron]] and [[Vas County (former)|Vas]], or in German as Pressburg, Wieselburg, \u00d6denburg and Eisenburg. After the town of Pozsony/Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]) was assigned to [[Czechoslovakia]], the number ''vier'' was dropped, but the name was kept because it was deemed to be appropriate for a region with so many old frontier castles. The \"Burgenland\" name was adopted by the first provincial Landtag in 1922.\n\nIn Hungarian the German name is generally accepted but there are three modern alternatives  used by minor groups. The Hungarian translation of the German name, \"V\u00e1rvid\u00e9k\", was invented by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Juh\u00e1sz]], an expert of the region in the 1970s, and it is becoming increasingly popular especially in tourist publications. The other two names \"\u0150rvid\u00e9k\" and \"Fels\u0151-\u0150rvid\u00e9k\" are derived from the name of the most important old Magyar language island, the Fels\u0151-\u0150rs\u00e9g. This microregion is around the town Fels\u0151\u0151r/Oberwart so these new names are a bit misleading however they are sometimes used.\n\nThe Croatian and Slovenian names \"{{lang|hr|Gradi\u0161\u0107e}}\" and \"{{lang|sl|Gradi\u0161\u010dansko}}\" are translations of the German name. The village of [[Jennersdorf]] is no more than 5 kilometers from the Slovenian and Hungarian borders (see the [[United Slovenia]] movement).\n\nAlternatively, the Serbs, Czechs and Slovaks call the western shores of the [[Neusiedler See]] (lake) surrounding the town of Rust Luzic or Lusic. However, the descendants of [[Serbs|Luzic Serbs]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]], [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] were eventually assimilated into the [[ethnic German]] or [[Magyarization|Hungarian]] cultures over four centuries.\n\nThe province has a long history of Slavic, as well Austrian-German and Hungarian-Magyar settlement. The province's easternmost portion (the shores of the Neusiedler See) carried its own topographical term ''Seewinkel'' in Austrian-German. This is the least Austrian-German influenced area since the Hungarian and Slovak borders are less than 10 kilometers away.\n\n==Symbols==\nHeraldic description of the coat-of-arms of Burgenland:\n\n:Or, standing upon a rock sable, an eagle regardant, wings displayed gules, langued of the same, crowned and armed of the first, on his breast an escutcheon paly of four, of the third and white fur, fimbriated of the field, and in dexter and sinister cantons two crosslets paty sable.\n\nThe arms were introduced in 1922 after the new province was created. They were composed from the arms of the two most important medieval noble families of the region, the counts of [[County of Nagymarton|Nagymarton]] and [[County of Frakn\u00f3|Frakn\u00f3]] (Mattersdorf-Forchtenstein, eagle on the rock) and the counts of [[County of N\u00e9met\u00fajv\u00e1r|N\u00e9met\u00fajv\u00e1r]] (G\u00fcssing, three bars of red and white fur).<ref>[http://hu.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%C3%ADmerhat%C3%A1roz%C3%B3/Burgenland_c%C3%ADmere]</ref>\n\nThe flag of the province shows two stripes of red and gold, the colours of the coat-of-arms.

It consists of two [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory cities]] and seven rural districts, with a total of 171 municipalities. It is {{convert|166|km|abbr=on}} long from north to south but much narrower from west to east ({{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} wide at [[Sieggraben]]). The region is part of the [[Centrope]] Project.\n\n==Geography==\nBurgenland is the third-smallest of Austria's nine [[States of Austria|states]], or ''Bundesl\u00e4nder'', at {{convert|3,962|km\u00b2|abbr=on}}. The highest point in the province is exactly on the border with [[Hungary]], on the [[Geschriebenstein]], {{convert|884|m|ft}} above sea level.  The highest point entirely within Burgenland is 879 metres above sea level; the lowest point (which is also the lowest point of [[Austria]]) at {{convert|114|m|ft}}, is in the municipal area of [[Apetlon]].\n\nBurgenland borders the Austrian state of [[Styria]] to the southwest, and the state of [[Lower Austria]] to the northwest. To the east it borders [[Hungary]] ([[Vas County]] and [[Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron County]]). In the extreme north and south there are short borders with [[Slovakia]] ([[Bratislava Region]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Mura Statistical Region]]) respectively.\n\nBurgenland and Hungary share the [[Neusiedler See]] (Hungarian: ''Fert\u0151 t\u00f3''), a lake known for its reeds and shallowness, as well as its mild climate throughout the year. The Neusiedler See is Austria's largest lake, and is a great tourist attraction, bringing ornithologists, sailors, and wind and kite surfers into the region north of the lake.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|2020 Burgenland state election}}\nBurgenland's state assembly ''([[Landtag]])'' has 36 seats. At the election held on [[2020 Burgenland state election|26 January 2020]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SP\u00d6) won an [[absolute majority]] of 19 seats, the [[Austrian People's Party]] (\u00d6VP) won 11 seats, the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FP\u00d6) won 4 seats and the [[Austrian Green Party|Green Party]] won 2 seats. The provincial government for the 2015\u20132020 term is a coalition of the SP\u00d6 and the FP\u00d6. The [[voting age]] for regional elections in Burgenland was reduced to 16 in 2003.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the state was 9 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 2.3% of the Austria's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 27,300 \u20ac or 90% of the EU27 average in the same year. Burgenland is the state with the lowest GDP per capita in Austria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nBurgenland consists of nine [[districts of Austria|districts]], two [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory cities]] and seven rural districts.

During Roman administration, it was part of the province of [[Pannonia]], and later part of the provinces of [[Pannonia Superior]] (in the 2nd century) and [[Pannonia Prima]] (in the 3rd century). During the late Roman Empire, Pannonia Prima province was part of larger administrative units, such are [[Diocese of Pannonia]], [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]] and [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy]].\n\n=== Early Germanic states ===\n[[File:MajorianEmpire.png|thumb|300px|right|The Ostrogothic Kingdom in Pannonia]]\nThe first [[Germanic people]] to settle in this region were the [[Ostrogoths]], who came to Pannonia in AD 380. The Ostrogoths became allies of [[Rome]] and were allowed to settle in Pannonia, being tasked to defend the [[Limes (Roman Empire)|Roman borders]]. In the 5th century, the area was conquered by the [[Huns]], but after their defeat, an independent Kingdom of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia was formed. The territory of present-day Burgenland became part of the Italian [[Kingdom of Odoacer]], but at the end of the 5th century the Ostrogothic king [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] conquered this kingdom and restored Ostrogothic administration in western Pannonia.\n\nIn the 6th century, the territory was included in another Germanic state, the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]]. However, the Lombards subsequently left towards [[Italy]] and the area came under the control of the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]]. Briefly in the 7th century, the area was part of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] State of [[Samo]], but was subsequently returned to Avar control. After the Avar defeat at the end of the 8th century, the area became part of the [[Frankish Empire]]. After the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] (or [[Augsburg]]) in 955, new [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] settlers came to the area.<ref name=\"Fischer2011\">{{cite book|author=Henry A.

On 20 September 1058 Agnes of Poitou and [[Andrew I of Hungary]], whose son later married a daughter of Agnes of Poitou, met to negotiate the border.<ref>Landeschronik Nieder\u00f6sterreich: 3000 Jahre in Daten, Dokumenten und Bildern, Seite 104, Karl Gutkas, C. Brandst\u00e4tter, 1990.</ref> The area of Burgenland remained the western border-zone of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary until the 16th century.\n\nThe majority of the population was Germanic, except for the Hungarian border-guards of the frontier March (''[[Gyep\u0171]]''). Germanic immigration from neighbouring Austria was also continuous in the Middle Ages.\n\n===Habsburg administration===\n[[File:Habsburg mortgages between 15th and 17th centuries.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Habsburg mortgages in Burgenland between the 15th and 17th centuries]]\nIn 1440 the territory of present-day Burgenland was controlled by the Habsburgs of Austria, and in 1463 the northern part of it (with the town of [[K\u0151szeg]]) became a mortgage-territory according to the peace treaty of [[Wiener Neustadt]]. In 1477 King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of Hungary had retaken the area, but in 1491 it was mortgaged again by King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary]] to Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. In 1647 Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] returned it to the Kingdom of Hungary (which itself was a Habsburg possession in this time).\n\nIn the 16th century, the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] lost its independence and its north-western part that was not conquered by the Ottoman Empire was included in the Habsburg Empire. This Habsburg possession was known as [[Royal Hungary]] and it included territory of present-day Burgenland and western Hungary. [[Royal Hungary]] still had counties. What is today Burgenland was in those times the Moson, Sopron and Vas counties of Hungary.\n[[File:Central europe 1572.png|thumb|The Kingdom of Hungary as divided into 3 parts]]\n\nIn the 16-17th centuries German [[Protestant]] refugees arrived in Western Royal Hungary to shelter from [[European wars of religion|the religious wars]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], particularly from the suppression of the Reformation in Austrian territories, then ruled by the staunchly Roman Catholic Habsburgs. After the Habsburg military victory against the Ottomans at the end of the 17th century, the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary was enlarged to include much of the territory of the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary. In the 17th and 18th centuries the region of Western Hungary was dominated by the wealthy Catholic landowning families, for example the [[House of Esterh\u00e1zy|Esterh\u00e1zys]] and [[Batthy\u00e1ny]]s. In 1867, the Habsburg Empire was transformed into the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.\n\n===Dissolution of Austria-Hungary===\nAccording to the 1910 census 291,800 people lived on the territory of present-day Burgenland. Among them 217,072 were German-speaking (74%), 43,633 Croatian-speaking (15%) and 26,225 (9%) Hungarian-speaking. [[Romani people|Roma people]] were counted according to their native language.\n\nIn December 1918, the [[Republic of Heinzenland]] was declared by Austrian politician [[Hans Suchard]] with the goal to eventually annex the territory into Austria. However, it was taken over within 2 days by Hungary.\n\nFrom March to August 1919, the Burgenland was part of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].\n\nThe area had also been discussed as the site of a [[Czech Corridor]] to Yugoslavia. The decision on \"German West Hungary\" (''Deutsch-Westungarn'') was fixed in the treaties of [[Treaty of Saint Germain|Saint Germain]] and [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]]. Despite diplomatic efforts by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], the victorious parties of World War I set the date of Burgenland's official unification with Austria for 28 August 1921. However, on that day sharpshooters with the support of Hungary prevented the establishment of Austrian police control and customs. [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[P\u00e1l Pr\u00f3nay]] and his men, the [[Rongyos G\u00e1rda]], defended western Hungary from occupation by Austrian officials and forces of the Austrian [[Gendarmerie (Austria)|Gendarmerie]]. Pr\u00f3nay had help from Hungarians and Croatians who did not want to live under Austrian rule, leading to the [[Uprising in West Hungary]] in 1921. Pr\u00f3nay occupied the whole area and created the state of [[Lajtab\u00e1ns\u00e1g]]. In 1921, general elections were held in the area. Sopron and 8 other villages voted to stay in Hungary. The other areas were handed over to Austria, to form the Austrian province of Burgenland.\n\n=== Ninth state of Austria ===\n[[File:Austria 25 Schilling 1961 Silver Coin Burgenland.jpg|left|thumb|Austrian 25-[[Austrian schilling|schilling]] silver coin (1961): ''40 years of Burgenland in Austria.'' It shows the Haydnkirche in the capital Eisenstadt.]]\nWith the help of Italian diplomatic mediation in the [[Venice Protocol]], the crisis was almost resolved in the autumn of 1921, when Hungary committed to disarm the sharpshooters by 6 November 1921. This was in exchange for a plebiscite on the unification of certain territories, including \u00d6denburg ([[Sopron]]), the designated capital of Burgenland, and eight surrounding villages. The vote took place from 14 to 16 December, and resulted in a clear (but doubted by Austria){{citation needed|date=January 2013}} vote of the people who inhabited the Sopron district to be part of Hungary. Consequently, the territory was incorporated into Austria, except for the Sopron district which was united with Hungary.\n[[File:Krensdorf-Tormafalu-war memorial.jpg|thumb|A memorial in [[Krensdorf]] to soldiers who died in the two World Wars]]\nIn contrast to all the other present Austrian states, which had been part of [[Cisleithania]], Burgenland did not constitute a specific ''[[Crown Land|Kronland]]'', and when it was formed it did not have its own regional political and administrative institutions such as a ''[[Landtag]]'' (representative assembly) and ''[[Statthalter]]'' (imperial governor).\n\nOn 18 July 1922, the first elections for the parliament of Burgenland took place. Various interim arrangements were required due to the changeover from Hungarian to Austrian jurisdiction. The parliament decided in 1925 on [[Eisenstadt]] as the capital of Burgenland, and moved from the various provisional estates throughout the country to the newly built ''Landhaus'' in 1929.\n\nThe first Austrian census in 1923 registered 285,600 people in Burgenland. The ethnic composition of the province had changed slightly: the percentage of Germans increased compared to 1910 (227,869 people, 80%) while the percentage of Hungarians rapidly declined (14,931 people, 5%). This was due mainly to the emigration of the Hungarian civil servants and intellectuals after the territory was ceded to Austria.\n\nIn 1923, emigration to the [[United States|United States of America]], which started in the late 19th century, reached its climax; in some places up to a quarter of the population went overseas.\n\nAfter the [[Nazi German]] ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria, the administrative unit of Burgenland was dissolved. Northern and central Burgenland joined the district of Niederdonau (Lower Danube) while southern Burgenland joined [[Steiermark]] (Styria).{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Jews of Burgenland were forced to emigrate in the immediate aftermath of the ''Anschluss''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zalmon |first1=Milka |title=Forced Emigration of the Jews of Burgenland |journal=Yad Vashem Studies |date=2003 |volume=XXXI |pages=287-324 |url=https://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%207002.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe policy of [[Germanization]] also affected other minorities, especially [[Burgenland Croats]] and Hungarians. Minority schools were closed and the use of their native language discouraged.\n\nIn 1944, the Nazis began to build the ''[[South-east wall|S\u00fcdostwall]]'' (South-east wall) with the help of mostly Jewish forced labor and collaborating inhabitants. This proved to be utterly useless when Soviet troops crossed the Hungarian\u2013Austrian border during and [[Soviet invasion of Austria|invaded Austria]]. In the last days of the Nazi regime many executions and death marches of Jewish forced laborers took place.\n\n=== Occupation ===\n[[File:Austria 1945-55.svg|thumb|300px|right|Burgenland under Soviet administration, 1945-1955]]\nAs of 1 October 1945 Burgenland was reestablished with Soviet support and given to the Soviet forces in exchange for [[Steiermark]] (Styria), which was in turn occupied by the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nUnder Soviet occupation, people in Burgenland had to endure a period of serious mistreatment and an extremely slow economic progress, the latter induced by the investor-discouraging presence of Soviet troops. The Soviet occupation ended with the signing of the [[Austrian Independence Treaty]] of [[Vienna]] in 1955 by the Occupying Forces.\n\nThe brutally crushed [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungarian Revolution]] on 23 October 1956 resulted in a wave of Hungarian refugees at the Hungarian-Austrian border, especially at the Andau Bridge ([[Br\u00fccke von Andau]]). They were received by the inhabitants of Burgenland with an overwhelming amount of hospitality.\n\nIn 1957, the construction of the \"anti-Fascist Protective Barrier\" resulted in a complete sealing off of the area under Soviet influence from the rest of the world, turning the Hungarian-Austrian border next to Burgenland into a deadly zone of minefields and barbed wire (on the Hungarian side of the border), referred to as the [[Iron Curtain]]. Even during the era of the Iron Curtain, local trains between the north and south of Burgenland operated as \"[[Korridorzug|corridor train]]s\" (''Korridorz\u00fcge'') &ndash; they had their doors locked as they crossed through Hungarian territory.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1971, the minefields were cleared because people were often harmed by them,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} even on the Austrian side of the border. This could well be taken as a sign of the Soviet Union leaning towards opening the borders to the West starting in the late 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n=== Recent history ===\n[[File:Centrope_Map.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Burgenland is part of [[Centrope]], a project establishing a multinational region in four [[Central Europe]]an states: [[Slovakia]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]] and the [[Czech Republic]].|right]]\nDespite Burgenland (especially the area around the [[Neusiedler See]]) always producing excellent wine, some vintners in Burgenland [[1985 Diethylene Glycol Wine Scandal|added illegal substances to their wine]] in the mid-1980s. When this was revealed, Austria's wine exports dwindled dramatically. After recovering from the scandal, vintners in Austria, and not only in Burgenland, started focusing on quality and mostly stopped producing low-quality wine.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nOn 27 July 1989, the [[Foreign minister]]s of Austria and Hungary, [[Alois Mock]] and [[Gyula Horn]], cut the [[Iron Curtain]] (in [[German language|German]]: \"Eiserner Vorhang\") in the village of [[Klingenbach]] in a symbolic act with far-reaching consequences. At the same time, the border crossing at Nickelsdorf (Austria) / Hegyeshalom (Hungary) was opened by the Hungarian border patrol and this enabled the escape of East Germans. Directly behind the wires special medic troops of the Austrian Red Cross awaited them and provided first assistance. Thousands of [[East Germany|East Germans]] used this possibility to flee to the West. Again, the inhabitants of Burgenland received them with great hospitality. Later, this was often referred to as the beginning of [[German reunification]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nAfter 1990 Burgenland regained its traditional role as a bridge between the western and eastern parts of [[Central Europe]]. In 2003 it joined an [[Interreg]] project [[Centrope]]. Cross-border links were further strengthened when [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]] joined the [[European Union]] in 2004. All three countries became part of the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen zone]] in late 2007, and border controls finally ceased to exist in the region.\n\n== Minorities ==\nBurgenland has notable [[Burgenland Croats|Croatian]] (29,000\u201345,000) and [[Hungarians in Austria|Hungarian]] (5,000\u201315,000) populations.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Croats===\n{{main|Burgenland Croats}}\nThe Croats arrived after the devastating [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] war in 1532, when the Ottoman army destroyed some settlements in their ethnic territory. The emigration in great haste of the Catholic remained population of western [[Slavonia]] into the Burgenland was \u2013 as far as possible \u2013 organized by the estate owners. The archives of the [[Sabor]] (the Croatian parliament) from this period contain numerous references to such resettlements. As reported in the spring of 1538 by the [[Ban of Croatia]], Petar [[House of Keglevi\u0107|Keglevi\u0107]], who himself owned large estates in western Slavonia, that the country's population at the Ottoman border was preparing to emigrate.<ref>K\u00f6lner geographische Arbeiten, Ausgaben 15\u201318, Seite 69, Geographisches Institut der Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln, 1963</ref> Their resettlement by estate owners was finished only in 1584. They have preserved their strong Catholic faith and their language until today, and in the 19th century their national identity grew stronger because of the influence of the National Revival in Croatia. Between 1918 and 1921 Croats opposed the planned annexation of West-Hungary to Austria, and in 1923 seven Croatian villages voted for a return to Hungary. The Croatian Cultural Association of Burgenland was established in 1934. In the Nazi era (1938\u201345) the Croatian language was officially prohibited, and the state pursued an aggressive policy of Germanization. The [[Austrian State Treaty]] of 1955 guaranteed minority rights for every native ethnic minority in Austria but Croats had to fight for the use of their language in schools and offices even in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2000 51 new bilingual village name signs were erected in Burgenland (47 Croatian and 4 Hungarian).\n\nThe [[Burgenland Croatian language]] is an interesting 16th century dialect which is different from standard Croatian. In minority schools and media the local dialect is used, and it has had a written form since the 17th century (the Gospel was first translated to this dialect in 1711). Today the language is endangered by assimilation, according to the UNESCO's [[Red Book of Endangered Languages]]. The Croats of Burgenland belong to the same group as their relatives on the other side of the modern-day border with Hungary.\n\n===Hungarians===\nHungarians live in the villages of [[Oberwart]]/Fels\u0151\u0151r, [[Unterwart]]/Als\u00f3\u0151r  and [[Siget in der Wart]]/\u0150risziget. The three villages together are called [[Upper \u0150rs\u00e9g]] (Hun: ''Fels\u0151-\u0150rs\u00e9g'', German: ''Wart''), and they have formed a language island since the 11th century. The other old Hungarian language island in [[Oberpullendorf]]/Fels\u0151pulya has almost disappeared today. The Hungarians of Burgenland were \"''\u0151r\u00f6k''\", i.e. guards of the western frontier, and their special dialect is similar to the [[Sz\u00e9kely]]s in Transylvania. Their cultural centre is Oberwart/Fels\u0151\u0151r. Another distinct Hungarian group were the indentured agricultural workers living on the huge estates north of Neusiedler See. They arrived mainly from the [[R\u00e1bak\u00f6z]] region. After the dissolution of the manors in the mid-20th century this group ceased to exist.\n\n===Roma and Jews===\nIn addition to Germans, Croats and Hungarians, Burgenland used to have substantial Roma and Jewish populations, wiped out by the Nazi regime. Before their deportation during 1938, the traditionally very religious Burgenland Jews were concentrated in the famous \"Seven Communities\" ([[Siebengemeinden]]/Sheva kehillot) in [[Eisenstadt]], [[Mattersburg]], [[Kittsee]], [[Frauenkirchen]], [[Kobersdorf]], [[Lackenbach]] and [[Deutschkreutz]], where they formed a substantial part of the population: e.g. in Lackenbach, 62% of the population was Jewish as of 1869{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. After the war, Jews from Burgenland founded the Jerusalem [[haredi]] neighbourhood of [[Kiryat Mattersdorf]], reminding of the original name of Mattersburg, once a centre of a famous yeshiva.\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Croatian language|Croatian]], it is known as ''Gradi\u0161\u0107e''; in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''\u0150rvid\u00e9k'', ''Fels\u0151\u0151rvid\u00e9k'' or ''V\u00e1rvid\u00e9k''; in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] as ''Gradi\u0161\u010danska''; and in the [[Prekmurje dialect]] as ''Gradi\u0161\u010de''.\n\nAs the region was not a territorial entity before 1921, it never had an official name. Until the end of [[World War I]] the German-speaking western borderland of the Kingdom of Hungary was sometimes unofficially called ''Deutsch-Westungarn'' (German West Hungary). The historical region included the border city of [[Sopron]] in Hungary (known as \u00d6denburg in German).\n\nThe name '''Vierburgenland''' (Land of Four Castles) was created in 1919 by Odo R\u00f6tig, a Viennese resident in Sopron. It was derived from the name of the four ''v\u00e1rmegye'' of the Kingdom of Hungary (in German ''Komitate'', 'counties') known in Hungarian as [[Pozsony County|Pozsony]], [[Moson County|Moson]], [[Sopron County|Sopron]] and [[Vas County (former)|Vas]], or in German as Pressburg, Wieselburg, \u00d6denburg and Eisenburg. After the town of Pozsony/Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]) was assigned to [[Czechoslovakia]], the number ''vier'' was dropped, but the name was kept because it was deemed to be appropriate for a region with so many old frontier castles. The \"Burgenland\" name was adopted by the first provincial Landtag in 1922.\n\nIn Hungarian the German name is generally accepted but there are three modern alternatives  used by minor groups. The Hungarian translation of the German name, \"V\u00e1rvid\u00e9k\", was invented by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Juh\u00e1sz]], an expert of the region in the 1970s, and it is becoming increasingly popular especially in tourist publications. The other two names \"\u0150rvid\u00e9k\" and \"Fels\u0151-\u0150rvid\u00e9k\" are derived from the name of the most important old Magyar language island, the Fels\u0151-\u0150rs\u00e9g. This microregion is around the town Fels\u0151\u0151r/Oberwart so these new names are a bit misleading however they are sometimes used.\n\nThe Croatian and Slovenian names \"{{lang|hr|Gradi\u0161\u0107e}}\" and \"{{lang|sl|Gradi\u0161\u010dansko}}\" are translations of the German name. The village of [[Jennersdorf]] is no more than 5 kilometers from the Slovenian and Hungarian borders (see the [[United Slovenia]] movement).\n\nAlternatively, the Serbs, Czechs and Slovaks call the western shores of the [[Neusiedler See]] (lake) surrounding the town of Rust Luzic or Lusic. However, the descendants of [[Serbs|Luzic Serbs]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]], [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] were eventually assimilated into the [[ethnic German]] or [[Magyarization|Hungarian]] cultures over four centuries.\n\nThe province has a long history of Slavic, as well Austrian-German and Hungarian-Magyar settlement. The province's easternmost portion (the shores of the Neusiedler See) carried its own topographical term ''Seewinkel'' in Austrian-German. This is the least Austrian-German influenced area since the Hungarian and Slovak borders are less than 10 kilometers away.\n\n==Symbols==\nHeraldic description of the coat-of-arms of Burgenland:\n\n:Or, standing upon a rock sable, an eagle regardant, wings displayed gules, langued of the same, crowned and armed of the first, on his breast an escutcheon paly of four, of the third and white fur, fimbriated of the field, and in dexter and sinister cantons two crosslets paty sable.\n\nThe arms were introduced in 1922 after the new province was created. They were composed from the arms of the two most important medieval noble families of the region, the counts of [[County of Nagymarton|Nagymarton]] and [[County of Frakn\u00f3|Frakn\u00f3]] (Mattersdorf-Forchtenstein, eagle on the rock) and the counts of [[County of N\u00e9met\u00fajv\u00e1r|N\u00e9met\u00fajv\u00e1r]] (G\u00fcssing, three bars of red and white fur).<ref>[http://hu.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%C3%ADmerhat%C3%A1roz%C3%B3/Burgenland_c%C3%ADmere]</ref>\n\nThe flag of the province shows two stripes of red and gold, the colours of the coat-of-arms. It was officially confirmed in 1971.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Wiener Blut Morbisch.jpg|thumb|right|Seefestspiele M\u00f6rbisch]]\n{{Original research|section|date=December 2019}}\nThe cultural offerings are diverse and especially in the summer famous for the Seefestspiele M\u00f6rbisch and the [[Nova Rock Festival]] with numerous international rockbands.\n\nThe permanent exhibition at [[Forchtenstein Castle]] shows an impressive collection of the dukes of [[Esterh\u00e1zy]], at whose court at [[Schloss Esterh\u00e1zy|Esterh\u00e1zy Palace]] worked the world-famous musician [[Joseph Haydn]], who composed from the [[Burgenland Croatian]] folk-song ''\"V jutro rano se ja stanem\"'' (\"In the morning I rise up early\") the melody of ''\"[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]\"'' (\"God save Franz the Emperor\"), which became the melody of today's [[national anthem of Germany]].<ref>Slavonic and East European review, Volume 34, page 2, University of London.

They each have their own [[ZIP Code]], post office and fire department but are otherwise simply neighborhood names.\n\nNext to Hanover Township is East Hanover Township which has a neighborhood called 'Hanover'. Also, there is a [[New Hanover Township, New Jersey|New Hanover Township]] and a [[North Hanover Township, New Jersey|North Hanover Township]] in [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]], and several other [[Hanover Township (disambiguation)|Hanover Township]]s in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Michigan]].  Furthermore, street signs and maps often do not identify Hanover Township but instead indicate one of the place names.\n\nResidents of Whippany and Cedar Knolls have become accustomed to indicating that they live in either Whippany or Cedar Knolls and not in Hanover Township. Some confusion comes from the difference between neighborhood boundaries, and the arbitrary ZIP Code boundaries that do not necessarily coincide with municipal boundaries resulting in township mailing addresses which use place names outside of the township.  Whippany's ZIP code is 07981 and Cedar Knolls' is 07927.\n\n==Notable events==\nOn January 5, 2009, five unidentified red lights were spotted in the night sky over Hanover Township and Morris County.

They each have their own [[ZIP Code]], post office and fire department but are otherwise simply neighborhood names.\n\nNext to Hanover Township is East Hanover Township which has a neighborhood called 'Hanover'. Also, there is a [[New Hanover Township, New Jersey|New Hanover Township]] and a [[North Hanover Township, New Jersey|North Hanover Township]] in [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]], and several other [[Hanover Township (disambiguation)|Hanover Township]]s in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Michigan]].  Furthermore, street signs and maps often do not identify Hanover Township but instead indicate one of the place names.\n\nResidents of Whippany and Cedar Knolls have become accustomed to indicating that they live in either Whippany or Cedar Knolls and not in Hanover Township. Some confusion comes from the difference between neighborhood boundaries, and the arbitrary ZIP Code boundaries that do not necessarily coincide with municipal boundaries resulting in township mailing addresses which use place names outside of the township.  Whippany's ZIP code is 07981 and Cedar Knolls' is 07927.\n\n==Notable events==\nOn January 5, 2009, five unidentified red lights were spotted in the night sky over Hanover Township and Morris County.
