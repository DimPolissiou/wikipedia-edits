Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary. The first \"bishop of the Croats\" is named ''Marko Giudice'', and he and his successors were attached to the royal court as preachers and king's \"special bishops\" until 1102.<ref>''[[Illyricum sacrum]]'', IV (Venice, 1775)</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=23}}\n\nIn the second half of the 11th century, Knin became a more permanent royal residence of king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] around 1080.

Due to the extinction of the local ruling dynasty, the Croatian bishop moved his see to Knin itself, after which he started calling himself the Bishop of Knin.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=28}} This precipitated the construction of a new cathedral, which was initiated in 1203 by the son of the Duke of Knin, Dobroslav in Kapitul.\n\nThe city was visited by Queen [[Maria Laskarina]], the daughter of the [[Byzantine Emperor]] and wife of king Bela IV, together with her retinue of nobles and a great number of soldiers in 1261 in order to introduce her son to the Croatian nobility and to negotiate their oath in recognizing him as the designated duke (herceg).{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=32}} In 1264, the first case of judicial function in the city was mentioned and during this time, Knin was the seat of both the Croatian ban, and the duke, who acted as a semi-independent ruler with close connection to the king and whose chancellor had been the bishop of Knin.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=33}} Between 1270 and 1272, the new cathedral was consecrated on the orders of the Knin bishop Nicholas.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1949}}<ref>Nikola Jak\u0161i\u0107, [https://www.academia.edu/22968166/Knin-_hrvatska_srednjovjekovna_prijestolnica_Split_1995 Knin- hrvatska srednjovjekovna prijestolnica, Split 1995] pp. 19</ref> The cathedral is described as being \"magnificent\" and \"solemn\" by subsequent documents.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia. Thus, these territories ''de facto'' continued to remain outside the monarchy, and the [[Nelipi\u0107 noble family]] made Knin their permanent seat and ruled their territories as \"Princes of Knin\".\n\nAfter successfully warring against their enemies, the Dalmatian cities and nobility under [[George II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Juraj II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]] (who was imprisoned in the castle's dungeons), as well as the royal forces commanded by the [[Ban of Slavonia|Slavonian ban]] ''Mikac Prodani\u0107'',<ref>Miha Madijev, cap. XXIII.{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}</ref> their rule came to an end when [[Louis I of Hungary]] personally led an army to re-establish royal power over Knin in 1345. During this time it became known that the castle consisted of two major parts, administered by two castellans and which was populated by houses and baths, a palace with a main hall used previously by the Nelipi\u0107's to sign an alliance with the [[Republic of Venice]] and to enforce customs on imports to the city.

There the noble Ivan Nelipi\u0107 (son of Vladislava) had reaffirmed his rights to the estates and lands in [[Cetina]] during his stay in the city.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|pp=52\u201353}}{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|pp=55\u201356}}\n[[File:StefatonKnin.png|thumb|right|250px|Stone slab of Knin Fortress depicting [[Stephaton]] thought to have originated from the Church of St. Stephen in the Knin's burg, 11th century]]\nUsing the dynastic instability in the neighboring lands, the city came into the hands of the Bosnian king [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]] during the year of 1388. The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]].

A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops.

Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

After the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] in 1805, the French Empire gained the city and incorporated it into the [[Illyrian Provinces]] in 1809. By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the [[Habsburg]] domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n====World War II====\nIn [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Knin was in the so-called [[Independent State of Croatia#Zones of influence|second Italian occupation zone]], administered by civilian authorities of collaborationist [[Independent State of Croatia]] led by fascist Ustasa regime, but with heavy [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italian]] military presence. Italians also relied heavily on local ethnic Serb militias ([[Chetniks]]) to maintain order and surpress [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan resistance]]. Chetniks and Ustasa officers collaborated as antifascist resistance intensified. Ustasa regime declared Knin [[Counties of the Independent State of Croatia|county seat]]. After [[Italian surrender]] in September 1943, German forces became the main factor in the region. As the war progressed and partisan forces liberated most of Dalmatia, with Germans pulling out and retreating northwards, Axis and partisan forces became pitted on Knin in a [[Battle of Knin|major battle]] in early December 1944. The [[8th Dalmatian Corps]] sought to destroy [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Usta\u0161e]] and [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] formations in North [[Dalmatia]] and the city of Knin. With around 50 thousand troops involved and more than 7 thousand casulties on both sides, it was a decisive partisan victory. Knin was liberated on December 9th.\n\n====Socialist Yugoslavia====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nBetween 1945 and 1990, Knin saw rapid industrialization and modernization, becoming a centre of a wider region.

As a consequence, ethnic/religious composition of town changed as well. Intermarriages and a desire to straddle the divide between the communities resulted at one point in a substantial part of the population declaring themselves as [[Yugoslavs]] rather than either Croats or Serbs (22% in 1981 census).\nPopulation of the town from 1830 to 2011, based on religion, language and ethnicity was as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"; text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''Population structure by ethnicity 1948\u20132011'''\n|-\n!

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the [[overhead line|catenary]] being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s). [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] had started from [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] inland towards the coast and had only reached Knin, so today the Knin station sidings are equipped with overhead catenary, but lines leaving the town are not.\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki-kolodvor-postaja-Knin-05082016-02-roberta-f.jpg|thumb|right|Knin railway station's platforms, notice the lack of catenary wires, and the presence of the poles only]]\n\n==Towns and villages in the municipality==\n\n*[[Golubi\u0107, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Golubi\u0107]]\n*Knin\n*[[Kninsko Polje]]\n*[[Kova\u010di\u0107, Croatia|Kova\u010di\u0107]]\n*[[Ljuba\u010d, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Ljuba\u010d]]\n*[[O\u0107estovo]]\n*[[Plavno, Croatia|Plavno]]\n*[[Pola\u010da, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Pola\u010da]]\n*[[Potkonje]]\n*[[Radljevac]]\n*[[Strmica, Croatia|Strmica]]\n*[[Vrpolje, Knin|Vrpolje]]\n*[[\u017dagrovi\u0107]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Croatia}}\n* [[Church of Saint Anthony, Knin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|ref={{harvid|ICJ|3 February 2015}}|title=Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia.

The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]].

A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

After the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] in 1805, the French Empire gained the city and incorporated it into the [[Illyrian Provinces]] in 1809. By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the [[Habsburg]] domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n====World War II====\nIn [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Knin was in the so-called [[Independent State of Croatia#Zones of influence|second Italian occupation zone]], administered by civilian authorities of collaborationist [[Independent State of Croatia]] led by fascist Ustasa regime, but with heavy [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italian]] military presence. Italians also relied heavily on local ethnic Serb militias ([[Chetniks]]) to maintain order and surpress [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan resistance]]. Chetniks and Ustasa officers collaborated as antifascist resistance intensified. Ustasa regime declared Knin [[Counties of the Independent State of Croatia|county seat]]. After [[Italian surrender]] in September 1943, German forces became the main factor in the region. As the war progressed and partisan forces liberated most of Dalmatia, with Germans pulling out and retreating northwards, Axis and partisan forces became pitted on Knin in a [[Battle of Knin|major battle]] in early December 1944. The [[8th Dalmatian Corps]] sought to destroy [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Usta\u0161e]] and [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] formations in North [[Dalmatia]] and the city of Knin.

The January average temperature is about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C and in August is about 24&nbsp;\u00b0C\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Knin (1971\u20132000, extremes 1949\u20132017)\n|width = auto\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 20.5\n|Feb record high C = 22.3\n|Mar record high C = 27.6\n|Apr record high C = 29.2\n|May record high C = 34.2\n|Jun record high C = 39.3\n|Jul record high C = 40.9\n|Aug record high C = 42.3\n|Sep record high C = 37.4\n|Oct record high C = 31.6\n|Nov record high C = 27.6\n|Dec record high C = 21.6\n|year record high C = 42.3\n| Jan high C = 8.9\n| Feb high C = 10.4\n| Mar high C = 14.1\n| Apr high C = 17.4\n| May high C = 23.0\n| Jun high C = 26.6\n| Jul high C = 30.1\n| Aug high C = 30.3\n| Sep high C = 25.4\n| Oct high C = 19.9\n| Nov high C = 13.7\n| Dec high C = 9.9\n|year high C = 19.1\n|Jan mean C = 4.0\n|Feb mean C = 5.1\n|Mar mean C = 8.2\n|Apr mean C = 11.5\n|May mean C = 16.6\n|Jun mean C = 20.1\n|Jul mean C = 23.0\n|Aug mean C = 22.5\n|Sep mean C = 18.0\n|Oct mean C = 13.3\n|Nov mean C = 8.2\n|Dec mean C = 5.0\n|year mean C = 13.0\n| Jan low C = -0.2\n| Feb low C = 0.7\n| Mar low C = 3.3\n| Apr low C = 6.5\n| May low C = 10.6\n| Jun low C = 13.8\n| Jul low C = 16.2\n| Aug low C = 16.0\n| Sep low C = 12.2\n| Oct low C = 8.3\n| Nov low C = 3.8\n| Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C = 7.7\n|Jan record low C = -18.3\n|Feb record low C = -18.4\n|Mar record low C = -14.0\n|Apr record low C = -4.1\n|May record low C = -0.4\n|Jun record low C = 4.3\n|Jul record low C = 8.1\n|Aug record low C = 6.8\n|Sep record low C = 1.0\n|Oct record low C = -3.3\n|Nov record low C = -8.5\n|Dec record low C = -15.4\n|year record low C = -18.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 75.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 69.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 74.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 92.0\n|May precipitation mm = 90.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 81.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 43.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 61.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 108.1\n|Oct precipitation mm = 114.3\n|Nov precipitation mm = 112.3\n|Dec precipitation mm = 101.7\n|year precipitation mm = 1025.8\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan precipitation days = 10.7\n| Feb precipitation days = 9.2\n| Mar precipitation days = 9.6\n| Apr precipitation days = 11.8\n| May precipitation days = 11.4\n| Jun precipitation days = 10.8\n| Jul precipitation days = 6.4\n| Aug precipitation days = 7.1\n| Sep precipitation days = 8.8\n| Oct precipitation days = 10.5\n| Nov precipitation days = 11.0\n| Dec precipitation days = 11.0\n|year precipitation days = 118.4\n|unit snow days = 1.0 cm\n|Jan snow days = 1.3\n|Feb snow days = 1.2\n|Mar snow days = 0.2\n|Apr snow days = 0.0\n|May snow days = 0.0\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.0\n|Oct snow days = 0.0\n|Nov snow days = 0.3\n|Dec snow days = 0.5\n|year snow days = 3.5\n|Jan humidity = 69.0\n|Feb humidity = 63.5\n|Mar humidity = 62.2\n|Apr humidity = 63.1\n|May humidity = 63.6\n|Jun humidity = 62.1\n|Jul humidity = 56.1\n|Aug humidity = 58.3\n|Sep humidity = 65.8\n|Oct humidity = 69.2\n|Nov humidity = 70.1\n|Dec humidity = 70.3\n|year humidity = 64.4\n|Jan sun = 120.9\n|Feb sun = 146.9\n|Mar sun = 182.9\n|Apr sun = 189.0\n|May sun = 244.9\n|Jun sun = 270.0\n|Jul sun = 325.5\n|Aug sun = 297.6\n|Sep sun = 234.0\n|Oct sun = 182.9\n|Nov sun = 123.0\n|Dec sun = 108.5\n|year sun =\n| source 1 = [[Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service]]<ref name= DHMZ >{{cite web\n| url = http://klima.hr/k1/k1_2/knin.pdf\n| title = Knin Climate Normals\n| accessdate = 3 December 2015\n| publisher = Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service}}</ref><ref name=monthlyvalues>{{cite web\n| url = http://klima.hr/klima.php?id=k1&param=srednjak&Grad=knin\n| title = Mjese\u010dne vrijednosti za Knin u razdoblju 1949\u22122014\n| language = Croatian\n| accessdate = 3 December 2015\n| publisher = Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service}}</ref>\n|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Knin population.png|thumb|Knin population 1857-2018]]\n[[File:Knin i Dinara.jpg|thumb|right|View of Knin and the [[Dinara]] mountain]]\n[[File:Kninska crkva u izgradnji.JPG|thumb|Our Lady of the Great Croatian Baptismal Vow church]]\n[[File:Arhitektura Bizanta u Kninu.JPG|thumb|Serbian Orthodox church in Knin]]\n\n[[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]] estimated the population of Knin municipality on December 31, 2018 to stand at 11,590.<ref>[https://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/Pokazatelji/Gradovi%20u%20statistici.xlsx Gradovi u statistici], Croatian Bureau of Statistics, published on 31/10/2019</ref> This represents a steep decline: just seven years earlier, in the [[2011 Census of Croatia|2011 census]], Knin municipality had a population of 15,388, while Knin (town) had a population of 10,493.<ref name=\"census2011\"/> In the 2001 census, the population of Knin was 15,190 (whole municipality) with 11,128 in town proper.

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991.

Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton}}</ref> ([[n\u00e9e]] '''Rodham'''; born October 26, 1947) is an American politician, diplomat, [[lawyer]], writer, and [[Public speaking|public speaker]]. She served as [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001, as a [[United States senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] from 2001 to 2009, and as the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States|67th]] [[United States Secretary of State|United States secretary of state]] from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for [[president of the United States]] by a major political party when she won the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election, which she lost to [[Donald Trump]].\n\nRaised in the Chicago suburb of [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]], Clinton graduated from [[Wellesley College]] in 1969 and earned a [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Yale Law School]] in 1973. After serving as a [[United States Congress|congressional]] legal counsel, she moved to [[Arkansas]] and married future president [[Bill Clinton]] in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, she co-founded [[Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families]]. She was appointed the first female chair of the [[Legal Services Corporation]] in 1978 and became the first female partner at [[Little Rock]]'s [[Rose Law Firm]] the following year. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992.\n\nAs First Lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for [[healthcare reform]]. In 1994, her major initiative\u2014the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|Clinton health care plan]]\u2014failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] and the [[Foster Care Independence Act]]. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the [[Lewinsky scandal]], which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage.\n\nIn 2000, Clinton was [[2000 United States Senate election in New York|elected]] as the first female [[List of United States Senators from New York|senator from New York]]. She was [[2006 United States Senate election in New York|re-elected in 2006]]. During her Senate tenure, Clinton advocated for medical benefits for first responders whose health was damaged in the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{Cite web|last1=McAfee|first1=Tierney|url=https://people.com/celebrity/911-how-hillary-clinton-and-donald-trump-responded-to-attacks/|title=How Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Responded to the 9/11 Attacks|website=PEOPLE.com|date=September 9, 2016|access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref> In 2008, Clinton [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|ran for president]] but was defeated by eventual winner [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic primaries]].\n\nClinton was U.S. secretary of state in the [[Obama Administration]] from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, Clinton responded to the [[Arab Spring]] by [[War Powers Resolution|advocating]] [[military intervention in Libya]]. She was harshly criticized by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the [[2012 Benghazi attack]]. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against [[Iran]] in an effort to force it to curtail its [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]]; this effort eventually led to the multinational [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] agreement in 2015. [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|Her use of a private e-mail server]] during her time as Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the e-mail controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election. Upon leaving her Cabinet position after Obama's first term, she wrote [[Hard Choices|her fifth book]] and undertook speaking engagements.\n\nClinton made a [[Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign|second presidential run in 2016]]. After winning the Democratic nomination, she ran in the general election with Virginia Senator [[Tim Kaine]] as her [[Vice President of the United States|running mate]]. Clinton lost the [[2016 United States elections|presidential election]] to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] despite winning a plurality of the [[Popular vote (representative democracy)|popular vote]]. Following her loss, she wrote her third memoir, ''[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]'', and launched [[Onward Together]], a [[501c4|political action organization]] dedicated to fundraising for [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] political groups. She is the current [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of [[Queen's University Belfast]] in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n===Early life===\nHillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Medical Center in [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Whitehouse.gov\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edgewaterhistory.org/ehs/articles/v14-3-4|title=Edgewater Hospital 1929\u20132001|author=O'Laughlin, Dania|date=Summer 2003|website=|publisher=Edgewater Historical Society|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref> She was raised in a [[United Methodist]] family who first lived in Chicago.

Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton}}</ref> ([[n\u00e9e]] '''Rodham'''; born October 26, 1947) is an American politician, diplomat, [[lawyer]], writer, and [[Public speaking|public speaker]]. She served as [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001, as a [[United States senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] from 2001 to 2009, and as the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States|67th]] [[United States Secretary of State|United States secretary of state]] from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for [[president of the United States]] by a major political party when she won the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election, which she lost to [[Donald Trump]].\n\nRaised in the Chicago suburb of [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]], Clinton graduated from [[Wellesley College]] in 1969 and earned a [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Yale Law School]] in 1973. After serving as a [[United States Congress|congressional]] legal counsel, she moved to [[Arkansas]] and married future president [[Bill Clinton]] in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, she co-founded [[Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families]]. She was appointed the first female chair of the [[Legal Services Corporation]] in 1978 and became the first female partner at [[Little Rock]]'s [[Rose Law Firm]] the following year. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992.\n\nAs First Lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for [[healthcare reform]]. In 1994, her major initiative\u2014the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|Clinton health care plan]]\u2014failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] and the [[Foster Care Independence Act]].

In October 1948, Ali left empty-handed. He died on 3 February 1951 in Cambridge \"destitute, forlorn and lonely\".{{sfnp|Kamran|2017|pp=87\u201388}} The funeral expenses of insolvent Ali were covered by [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] on the instructions of its Master.

However, in 1930 he moved to England to join [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College Cambridge]], in 1931. Subsequently, he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA degree]] in 1933 and [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1940 from the [[University of Cambridge]].

Rahmat Ali finished education in England, obtaining MA and LLB with honours from the universities of Cambridge and Dublin. In 1946, he founded the [[Pakistan National Movement]] in England. Until 1947, he continued publishing various booklets about his vision for South Asia. The final [[Partition of India]] disillusioned him due to the mass killings and mass migrations it ended up producing. He was also dissatisfied with the [[Radcliffe Line|distribution of areas]] among the two countries and considered it a major reason for the disturbances.\n\n== Philosophy ==\nAs such, Ali's writings, in addition to those of [[Muhammad Iqbal]] and others were major catalysts for the formation of Pakistan. He offered the name \"[[Eastern Bengal and Assam|Bangistan]]\" for a Muslim homeland in the [[Bengal]] region, and \"[[Hyderabad State|Osmanistan]]\" for a Muslim homeland in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]].

It was in one of the rooms of this house that he is said to have written the word 'Pakstan' for the first time. There are several accounts of the creation of the name.

He offered the name \"[[Eastern Bengal and Assam|Bangistan]]\" for a Muslim homeland in the [[Bengal]] region, and \"[[Hyderabad State|Osmanistan]]\" for a Muslim homeland in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]].
