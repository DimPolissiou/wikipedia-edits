After some solo releases including 1958's \"That Crazy Feeling\", Rogers then joined a group with the  [[jazz]] singer [[Bobby Doyle (jazz vocalist)|Bobby Doyle]]. In 1966 he became a member of the [[folk music|folk]] ensemble [[the New Christy Minstrels]], playing [[double bass]] and [[bass guitar]] as well as singing.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> In 1967, he and several members of the New Christy Minstrels left to found the group [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition|the First Edition]], with whom he scored his first major hit, \"[[Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)]]\", a [[psychedelic rock]] song which peaked at number five on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. As Rogers took an increased leadership role in the First Edition, and following the success of 1969's \"[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town]]\", the band gradually changed styles to a more [[country music|country]] feel. The band broke up in 1975\u20131976, and Rogers embarked on a long and successful solo career, which included several successful collaborations, including duets with singers [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Sheena Easton]], and a songwriting partnership with [[Lionel Richie]]. His signature song, 1978's \"[[The Gambler (song)|The Gambler]]\", was a cross-over hit that won him a [[Grammy Award]] in 1980 and was selected in 2018 for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].

The group recorded for [[Columbia Records]]. They disbanded in 1965, and a 1966 jazzy rock single Rogers recorded for [[Mercury Records]], called \"[[Here's That Rainy Day]]\", failed. Rogers also worked as a producer, writer and session musician for other performers, including country artists [[Mickey Gilley]] and [[Eddy Arnold]]. In 1966, he joined [[the New Christy Minstrels]] as a singer and [[double bass]] player.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nFeeling that the Minstrels were not offering the success they wanted, Rogers and fellow members Mike Settle, Terry Williams, and Thelma Camacho left the group.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> They formed [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition|the First Edition]] in 1967 (later renamed \"Kenny Rogers and the First Edition\").

Together the duo won two gold records (one of which later went platinum), two CMA Awards, an ACM nomination, two Grammy nominations and 1 Music City News Award for their two hit albums ''Every Time Two Fools Collide'' (No.&nbsp;1) and ''Classics'' (No.&nbsp;3), selling out stadiums and arenas while on tour for several years, as well as appearing on several network television specials which showcased them. Their hits together \"[[Every Time Two Fools Collide (song)|Every Time Two Fools Collide]]\" (No.&nbsp;1), \"Anyone Who Isn't Me Tonight\" (No.&nbsp;2), \"[[What Are We Doin' in Love]]\" (No.&nbsp;1), \"All I Ever Need Is You\" (No.&nbsp;1) and \"Till I Can Make It On My Own\" (No.&nbsp;3) all became Country standards. Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: \"She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion that you actually believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions.\" In a 1978 press release for their album \"Every Time Two Fools Collide\", Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences. Rogers was with West only hours before she died at age 58 after sustaining injuries in a 1991 car accident, as discussed in his 2012 biography \"Luck Or Something Like It\". In 1995 he starred as himself, alongside Michele Lee as West, in the [[CBS]] biographical film ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]''.\n\nIn 1980, a selection he recorded as a duet with [[Kim Carnes]], \"[[Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer]]\", became a major hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/2017-01-26/kenny-rogers-final-tour-retiring-includes-concert-thrasher-horne-saturday |title=Kenny Rogers' final tour before retiring includes concert at Thrasher-Horne on Saturday |author=Crumpler, David |date=January 26, 2017 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]}}</ref> Earlier that year, he sang a duet of \"You and Me\" with [[Lynda Carter]] in her television music special ''Lynda Carter Special'' (Rogers originally recorded this with Dottie West for the [[Every Time Two Fools Collide]] album).  Later in 1980 came his partnership with [[Lionel Richie]] who wrote and produced Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> Richie went on to produce Rogers' 1981 album ''Share Your Love,'' a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as \"[[I Don't Need You]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;3), \"[[Through the Years (Kenny Rogers song)|Through the Years]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;13), and \"[[Share Your Love with Me]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. In 1982, Rogers released the album ''[[Love Will Turn You Around]].'' The album's [[Love Will Turn You Around (song)|the title track]] reached No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped the country and AC charts. It was the theme song of Rogers' 1982 film ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]''. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer [[David Foster]] in 1983, recording the smash Top 10 hit [[Bob Seger]] [[cover version|cover]] \"[[We've Got Tonight]]\", a duet with [[Sheena Easton]]. Also a number 1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nIn 1981, Rogers bought the old ABC Dunhill building and built one of the most popular and state-of-the-art recording studios in Los Angeles.

Gibb insisted on doing the entire album together.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\n\"Islands in the Stream\", Rogers' duet with Dolly Parton, was the first single to be released from ''Eyes That See in the Dark'' in the United States, and it quickly went to No.&nbsp;1 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (it would prove to be the last country single to reach No.&nbsp;1 on that chart until \"[[Amazed]]\" by [[Lonestar]] did so in 2000), as well as topping ''Billboard''{{'}}s country and adult contemporary singles charts;  it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping two million copies in the United States. Rogers would reunite with Parton in 1984 for a holiday album, [[Once Upon a Christmas (Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton album)|''Once Upon a Christmas'']] and TV special ''Kenny & Dolly: A Christmas to Remember'' (which resulted in a popular video of \"Christmas Without You\"), as well as a 1985 duet \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\", which also topped the U.S. country singles chart. The two would continue to collaborate on occasional projects through subsequent years, including a 2013 duet single \"[[You Can't Make Old Friends]]\".<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nDespite the success of \"Islands in the Stream\", however, [[RCA Records]] insisted on releasing ''Eyes''{{'}} title track as the first UK single, and the song stalled at a disappointing No.&nbsp;61 there, although it did stay in the top 100 for several weeks. (When it was eventually released in the United States, it was more successful, charting high on the Adult Contemporary chart and making the country top 30.) \"Islands in the Stream\" was issued as a follow-up single in Britain and sold well, making No.&nbsp;7. The album itself reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts on both sides of the Atlantic and enjoyed multi-million sales. \"Buried Treasure\", \"This Woman\" and \"Evening Star\"/\"Midsummer Nights\" were also all successful singles from the album.\n\nShortly after came the album ''[[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers album)|What About Me?]]'', a hit whose [[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers song)|title track]]\u2014a trio performance with [[James Ingram]] and [[Kim Carnes]]\u2014was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]; the single \"Crazy\" (not to be confused with the [[Willie Nelson]]-penned [[Patsy Cline]] hit) topped the country charts. David Foster was to work again with Rogers in his 1985 album ''The Heart of the Matter,'' although this time Foster was playing backing music rather than producing, a role given to [[George Martin]]. This album was another success, going to No.&nbsp;1, with the title track making to the top ten category in the singles charts.\n\nThe next few years saw Rogers scoring several top country hits on a regular basis, including \"Twenty Years Ago\", \"Morning Desire\", \"Tomb of the Unknown Love\", among others.  On January 28, 1985, Rogers was one of the 45 artists who recorded the worldwide charity song \"[[We Are the World]]\" to support hunger victims in Africa. The following year he played at Giants Stadium.<ref name=\"Front Row King\">{{cite web|title=Kenny Rogers Concert Tickets |publisher=[[Front Row King]]|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/buy-kenny-rogers-concert-tickets/index.html|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Rogers won a Grammy Award for \"Best Country Collaboration with Vocals\" with [[Ronnie Milsap]]\u2014\"Make No Mistake, She's Mine\". In the 1990s, Rogers continued to chart with singles such as \"The Factory\" and \"Crazy In Love\", another selection that Kim Carnes provided him with, \"If You Want To Find Love\", and \"The Greatest\". His second Christmas album, titled ''Christmas in America,'' was released in 1989 for Reprise Records. From 1991\u201394, Rogers hosted ''[[The Real West]]'' on [[A&E Network|A&E]], and on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] since 1995 (Reruns only on The History Channel). He visited Miller's during this time period. From 1992\u201395, Rogers co-owned and headlined [[Branson, Missouri]]'s 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre. In 1994, Rogers released his \"dream\" album titled ''Timepiece'' on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 1930s/1940s jazz standards, the type of music he had performed in his early days with the Bobby Doyle Three in [[Houston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/arts-and-entertainment/20161201/kenny-rogers-plans-to-fold-em-after-final-concert-tour |title=Kenny Rogers plans to fold 'em after final concert tour |author=Graff, Gary |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[Oakland Press]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Rogers released an album ''Vote For Love'' where the public requested their favorite love songs and Rogers performed the songs. (Several of his own hits were in the final version.) The album was the first for the TV shopping channel QVC's record label, onQ Music. The album, sold exclusively by [[QVC]], was a huge success and was later issued in stores under a variety of different titles. It reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK country charts under the title ''Love Songs'' (a title also used for various compilations) and also crossed over into the mainstream charts.\n\nIn 1999, Rogers scored with the single \"The Greatest\", a song about life from a child's point of view (looked at through a baseball game)<ref name=RugbyIndependent2007 /> The song reached the top 40 of ''Billboard's'' Country singles chart and was a [[Country Music Television]] Number One video.

Rogers held the record until 2003, when then 70-year-old [[Willie Nelson]] became the oldest artist to have a No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts with his duet with [[Toby Keith]], \"[[Beer for My Horses]]\".\n\nAlthough Rogers did not record new albums for a couple of years, he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages.  In 2004 ''[[42 Ultimate Hits]]'', which was the first hits collection to span his days with the First Edition to the present, reached Number 6 on the American country charts and went gold.  It also featured two new songs, \"My World Is Over\" with [[Whitney Duncan]] and \"We Are the Same\".  \"My World Is Over\" was released as a single and was a minor hit. In 2005 ''The Very Best of Kenny Rogers'', a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Rogers hits album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.\n\nRogers also signed with [[Capitol Records]] and had more success with the TV advertised release ''21 Number Ones'' in January 2006. Although this CD did contain 21 chart-toppers as the title claims (recorded between 1976 and the present day), this was not a complete collection of Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 singles, omitting such singles as \"Crazy in Love\" and \"What About Me?\"\n\nCapitol followed ''21 Number Ones'' with Rogers' new studio album, ''[[Water & Bridges]]'', in March 2006 on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol Nashville Records]] label. The first single from the album was \"[[I Can't Unlove You]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;17 on the country charts, after spending over 6 months on the hit list, more than 50 years after he formed his first group and 38 years after his first major hit as leader of the First Edition; the song remains in recurrent airplay on some radio stations today. \"I Can't Unlove You\" was followed up with the second single from the album, \"The Last Ten Years (Superman)\", in September 2006. The third single, \"Calling Me\", which features [[Don Henley]], became popular in early 2007, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. Also in 2007, the 1977 ''Kenny Rogers'' album was re-issued as a double CD, also featuring the 1979 ''Kenny'' album and this once again put Rogers' name into the sales charts worldwide. The following year, another compilation album (''A Love Song Collection'') also charted.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nOn August 26, 2008, Rogers released ''50 Years''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/kenny-rogers-celebrates-new-project-of-old-classics/336423|title=Kenny Rogers Q&A\u2014Celebrates New Project with Old Classics|publisher=AOL Music Canada|date=March 24, 2009|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> exclusively at Cracker Barrel stores.

The group recorded for [[Columbia Records]]. They disbanded in 1965, and a 1966 jazzy rock single Rogers recorded for [[Mercury Records]], called \"[[Here's That Rainy Day]]\", failed. Rogers also worked as a producer, writer and session musician for other performers, including country artists [[Mickey Gilley]] and [[Eddy Arnold]].

Together the duo won two gold records (one of which later went platinum), two CMA Awards, an ACM nomination, two Grammy nominations and 1 Music City News Award for their two hit albums ''Every Time Two Fools Collide'' (No.&nbsp;1) and ''Classics'' (No.&nbsp;3), selling out stadiums and arenas while on tour for several years, as well as appearing on several network television specials which showcased them.

Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: \"She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion that you actually believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions.\" In a 1978 press release for their album \"Every Time Two Fools Collide\", Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences. Rogers was with West only hours before she died at age 58 after sustaining injuries in a 1991 car accident, as discussed in his 2012 biography \"Luck Or Something Like It\". In 1995 he starred as himself, alongside Michele Lee as West, in the [[CBS]] biographical film ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]''.\n\nIn 1980, a selection he recorded as a duet with [[Kim Carnes]], \"[[Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer]]\", became a major hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/2017-01-26/kenny-rogers-final-tour-retiring-includes-concert-thrasher-horne-saturday |title=Kenny Rogers' final tour before retiring includes concert at Thrasher-Horne on Saturday |author=Crumpler, David |date=January 26, 2017 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]}}</ref> Earlier that year, he sang a duet of \"You and Me\" with [[Lynda Carter]] in her television music special ''Lynda Carter Special'' (Rogers originally recorded this with Dottie West for the [[Every Time Two Fools Collide]] album).  Later in 1980 came his partnership with [[Lionel Richie]] who wrote and produced Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> Richie went on to produce Rogers' 1981 album ''Share Your Love,'' a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as \"[[I Don't Need You]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;3), \"[[Through the Years (Kenny Rogers song)|Through the Years]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;13), and \"[[Share Your Love with Me]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. In 1982, Rogers released the album ''[[Love Will Turn You Around]].'' The album's [[Love Will Turn You Around (song)|the title track]] reached No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped the country and AC charts. It was the theme song of Rogers' 1982 film ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]''. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer [[David Foster]] in 1983, recording the smash Top 10 hit [[Bob Seger]] [[cover version|cover]] \"[[We've Got Tonight]]\", a duet with [[Sheena Easton]]. Also a number 1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nIn 1981, Rogers bought the old ABC Dunhill building and built one of the most popular and state-of-the-art recording studios in Los Angeles. The song \"[[We Are the World]]\" was recorded there and at [[Jim Henson Company Lot|A & M Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FyUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=kenny+rogers+lion+share+recording+studio#v=onepage|title=Rogers Buys Studio|last=McCullaugh|first=Jim|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 6, 1982|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nRogers went on to work with [[Barry Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] who produced his 1983 hit album ''[[Eyes That See in the Dark]]'', featuring the title track and yet another No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\", a duet with [[Dolly Parton]].

Gibb insisted on doing the entire album together.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\n\"Islands in the Stream\", Rogers' duet with Dolly Parton, was the first single to be released from ''Eyes That See in the Dark'' in the United States, and it quickly went to No.&nbsp;1 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (it would prove to be the last country single to reach No.&nbsp;1 on that chart until \"[[Amazed]]\" by [[Lonestar]] did so in 2000), as well as topping ''Billboard''{{'}}s country and adult contemporary singles charts;  it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping two million copies in the United States. Rogers would reunite with Parton in 1984 for a holiday album, [[Once Upon a Christmas (Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton album)|''Once Upon a Christmas'']] and TV special ''Kenny & Dolly: A Christmas to Remember'' (which resulted in a popular video of \"Christmas Without You\"), as well as a 1985 duet \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\", which also topped the U.S. country singles chart. The two would continue to collaborate on occasional projects through subsequent years, including a 2013 duet single \"[[You Can't Make Old Friends]]\".<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nDespite the success of \"Islands in the Stream\", however, [[RCA Records]] insisted on releasing ''Eyes''{{'}} title track as the first UK single, and the song stalled at a disappointing No.&nbsp;61 there, although it did stay in the top 100 for several weeks. (When it was eventually released in the United States, it was more successful, charting high on the Adult Contemporary chart and making the country top 30.) \"Islands in the Stream\" was issued as a follow-up single in Britain and sold well, making No.&nbsp;7. The album itself reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts on both sides of the Atlantic and enjoyed multi-million sales. \"Buried Treasure\", \"This Woman\" and \"Evening Star\"/\"Midsummer Nights\" were also all successful singles from the album.\n\nShortly after came the album ''[[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers album)|What About Me?]]'', a hit whose [[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers song)|title track]]\u2014a trio performance with [[James Ingram]] and [[Kim Carnes]]\u2014was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]; the single \"Crazy\" (not to be confused with the [[Willie Nelson]]-penned [[Patsy Cline]] hit) topped the country charts. David Foster was to work again with Rogers in his 1985 album ''The Heart of the Matter,'' although this time Foster was playing backing music rather than producing, a role given to [[George Martin]]. This album was another success, going to No.&nbsp;1, with the title track making to the top ten category in the singles charts.\n\nThe next few years saw Rogers scoring several top country hits on a regular basis, including \"Twenty Years Ago\", \"Morning Desire\", \"Tomb of the Unknown Love\", among others.  On January 28, 1985, Rogers was one of the 45 artists who recorded the worldwide charity song \"[[We Are the World]]\" to support hunger victims in Africa. The following year he played at Giants Stadium.<ref name=\"Front Row King\">{{cite web|title=Kenny Rogers Concert Tickets |publisher=[[Front Row King]]|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/buy-kenny-rogers-concert-tickets/index.html|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Rogers won a Grammy Award for \"Best Country Collaboration with Vocals\" with [[Ronnie Milsap]]\u2014\"Make No Mistake, She's Mine\". In the 1990s, Rogers continued to chart with singles such as \"The Factory\" and \"Crazy In Love\", another selection that Kim Carnes provided him with, \"If You Want To Find Love\", and \"The Greatest\". His second Christmas album, titled ''Christmas in America,'' was released in 1989 for Reprise Records. From 1991\u201394, Rogers hosted ''[[The Real West]]'' on [[A&E Network|A&E]], and on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] since 1995 (Reruns only on The History Channel). He visited Miller's during this time period. From 1992\u201395, Rogers co-owned and headlined [[Branson, Missouri]]'s 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre. In 1994, Rogers released his \"dream\" album titled ''Timepiece'' on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 1930s/1940s jazz standards, the type of music he had performed in his early days with the Bobby Doyle Three in [[Houston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/arts-and-entertainment/20161201/kenny-rogers-plans-to-fold-em-after-final-concert-tour |title=Kenny Rogers plans to fold 'em after final concert tour |author=Graff, Gary |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[Oakland Press]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Rogers released an album ''Vote For Love'' where the public requested their favorite love songs and Rogers performed the songs. (Several of his own hits were in the final version.) The album was the first for the TV shopping channel QVC's record label, onQ Music. The album, sold exclusively by [[QVC]], was a huge success and was later issued in stores under a variety of different titles. It reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK country charts under the title ''Love Songs'' (a title also used for various compilations) and also crossed over into the mainstream charts.\n\nIn 1999, Rogers scored with the single \"The Greatest\", a song about life from a child's point of view (looked at through a baseball game)<ref name=RugbyIndependent2007 /> The song reached the top 40 of ''Billboard's'' Country singles chart and was a [[Country Music Television]] Number One video. It was on Rogers' album ''She Rides Wild Horses'' the following year (itself a top 10 success).<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> In 1999, Rogers also produced a song, \"We've Got It All\", specifically for the series finale of the ABC show ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]].'' Not found on any album, the recording sells for a high sum at auction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===2000\u20132015===\n[[File:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|thumb|right|Rogers in 2004]]\nIn the 21st century (and at age 61), Rogers was back at No.&nbsp;1 for the first time in more than a decade with the 2000 single \"[[Buy Me a Rose]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> In doing so, he broke a 26-year-old record held by [[Hank Snow]] (who, in April 1974, was aged 59 when he scored with \"Hello Love\"). Rogers held the record until 2003, when then 70-year-old [[Willie Nelson]] became the oldest artist to have a No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts with his duet with [[Toby Keith]], \"[[Beer for My Horses]]\".\n\nAlthough Rogers did not record new albums for a couple of years, he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages.  In 2004 ''[[42 Ultimate Hits]]'', which was the first hits collection to span his days with the First Edition to the present, reached Number 6 on the American country charts and went gold.  It also featured two new songs, \"My World Is Over\" with [[Whitney Duncan]] and \"We Are the Same\".  \"My World Is Over\" was released as a single and was a minor hit. In 2005 ''The Very Best of Kenny Rogers'', a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Rogers hits album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.\n\nRogers also signed with [[Capitol Records]] and had more success with the TV advertised release ''21 Number Ones'' in January 2006. Although this CD did contain 21 chart-toppers as the title claims (recorded between 1976 and the present day), this was not a complete collection of Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 singles, omitting such singles as \"Crazy in Love\" and \"What About Me?\"\n\nCapitol followed ''21 Number Ones'' with Rogers' new studio album, ''[[Water & Bridges]]'', in March 2006 on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol Nashville Records]] label. The first single from the album was \"[[I Can't Unlove You]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;17 on the country charts, after spending over 6 months on the hit list, more than 50 years after he formed his first group and 38 years after his first major hit as leader of the First Edition; the song remains in recurrent airplay on some radio stations today. \"I Can't Unlove You\" was followed up with the second single from the album, \"The Last Ten Years (Superman)\", in September 2006. The third single, \"Calling Me\", which features [[Don Henley]], became popular in early 2007, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. Also in 2007, the 1977 ''Kenny Rogers'' album was re-issued as a double CD, also featuring the 1979 ''Kenny'' album and this once again put Rogers' name into the sales charts worldwide. The following year, another compilation album (''A Love Song Collection'') also charted.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nOn August 26, 2008, Rogers released ''50 Years''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/kenny-rogers-celebrates-new-project-of-old-classics/336423|title=Kenny Rogers Q&A\u2014Celebrates New Project with Old Classics|publisher=AOL Music Canada|date=March 24, 2009|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> exclusively at Cracker Barrel stores.

He first achieved fame as the guitarist and co-songwriter of [[the Smiths]], who were active from 1982 to 1987. He has since performed with numerous other bands and embarked on a solo career.\n\nBorn in [[Ardwick]], [[Manchester]], to Irish parents, Marr formed his first band at the age of 13. He was part of several bands with [[Andy Rourke]] before forming the Smiths with [[Morrissey]] in 1982. The Smiths attained commercial success and were critically acclaimed, with Marr's [[jangle pop]] guitar style becoming distinctive of the band's sound, but separated in 1987 due to personal differences between Marr and Morrissey. Since then, Marr has been a member of [[the Pretenders]], [[The The]], [[Electronic (band)|Electronic]], [[Modest Mouse]], and [[the Cribs]], and he has become a prolific [[session musician]], working with names such as [[Talking Heads]] and [[Hans Zimmer]].\n\nHaving released an album titled ''[[Boomslang (album)|Boomslang]]'' in 2003 under the name Johnny Marr and the Healers, Marr released his first solo album, ''[[The Messenger (Johnny Marr album)|The Messenger]]'', in 2013. His second solo album, [[Playland (album)|''Playland'']], was released in 2014, followed by a third, ''[[Call the Comet]]'', in 2018. Marr's autobiography, ''Set the Boy Free'', was published in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnny-marr.com/autobiography/johnny-marrs-autobiography|title=You are being redirected...|website=www.johnny-marr.com|access-date=11 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nVoted the fourth-best guitarist of the last 30 years in a poll conducted by the [[BBC]] in 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20100409_axefactor.shtml|title=Chilis star wins Axe Factor|publisher=BBC|date=30 April 2010|accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref> Phil Alexander, editor-in-chief of ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', has described Marr as \"arguably Britain's last great guitar stylist\".<ref>Mojo magazine.

Marr and Rourke then formed a [[funk]] band, Freak Party, with [[Simon Wolstencroft]] on drums. Around this time, Marr first met [[Matt Johnson (singer)|Matt Johnson]], with whom he would later collaborate.{{sfn|Rogan|1994|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n==The Smiths==\n{{Main|The Smiths}}\nBy early 1982, Freak Party had fizzled out, being unable to find a singer. Marr approached Rob Allman, singer in White Dice, who suggested [[Morrissey|Steven Morrissey]], a singer with the short-lived punk band [[the Nosebleeds]]. Marr approached a mutual friend asking to be introduced and they visited Morrissey at his house in Kings Road, [[Stretford]] in May.{{sfn|Rogan|1994|p=37}}\n\nMarr's [[Jangle pop|jangly]] [[Rickenbacker]] and [[Fender Telecaster]] guitar playing became synonymous with the Smiths' sound. Marr's friend [[Andy Rourke]] joined as bass player and [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] was recruited as drummer. Signing to [[Independent record label|indie label]] [[Rough Trade Records]], they released their first single, \"[[Hand in Glove]]\", on 13 May 1983. By February 1984, the Smiths' fanbase was sufficiently large to launch the band's long-awaited [[The Smiths (album)|eponymous debut album]] to number two in the UK chart. Early in 1985, the band released their second album, ''[[Meat Is Murder]]''. This was more strident and political than its predecessor, and it was the band's only album (barring compilations) to reach number one in the UK charts. During 1985 the band completed lengthy tours of the UK and the US while recording the next studio record, ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]''.\n\nIn 1989 ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine rated ''The Queen is Dead'' as number one of \"The Greatest Albums Ever Made\". Spin was not alone in this designation\u2014numerous periodicals rank the Smiths and their albums, especially ''The Queen is Dead'', high on their best ever lists. ''[[NME]]'', for example, has dubbed the Smiths the most important rock band of all time. A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told ''NME'', \"'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit... dangerous. I was just drinking more than I could handle.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Kelly, Danny |date=14 February 1987 |title=Exile on Mainstream |format=http |work=[[NME]], cited at Foreverill.com |url=http://foreverill.com/interviews/1987/exile.htm |accessdate=22 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031722/http://foreverill.com/interviews/1987/exile.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}</ref> Meanwhile, Rourke was fired from the band in early 1986 due to his use of heroin, although he was reinstated in short order. Despite their continued success, personal differences within the band \u2013 including the increasingly strained relationship between Morrissey and Marr\u2014saw them on the verge of splitting.\n\nIn June 1987, Marr left the group, and auditions to find a replacement for him proved fruitless. By the time ''[[Strangeways, Here We Come (album)|Strangeways, Here We Come]]'' (named after [[Strangeways Prison]], Manchester) was released in September, the band had split up.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/ca2e0e30-afaa-4bc6-86d9-53343d9ddf41 | title=10 of the most dramatic resignations in rock and pop - BBC Music| date=2016-07-06}}</ref> The breakdown in the relationship has been primarily attributed to Morrissey's becoming annoyed by Marr's work with other artists and Marr's growing frustration with Morrissey's musical inflexibility. Referring to the songs recorded in the band's last session together (B-sides for the \"Girlfriend in a Coma\" single, which preceded the album's release), Marr said \"I wrote '[[I Keep Mine Hidden]]', but 'Work Is a Four-Letter Word' I hated. That was the last straw, really.

He first achieved fame as the guitarist and co-songwriter of [[the Smiths]], who were active from 1982 to 1987. He has since performed with numerous other bands and embarked on a solo career.\n\nBorn in [[Ardwick]], [[Manchester]], to Irish parents, Marr formed his first band at the age of 13. He was part of several bands with [[Andy Rourke]] before forming the Smiths with [[Morrissey]] in 1982. The Smiths attained commercial success and were critically acclaimed, with Marr's [[jangle pop]] guitar style becoming distinctive of the band's sound, but separated in 1987 due to personal differences between Marr and Morrissey.

Marr approached Rob Allman, singer in White Dice, who suggested [[Morrissey|Steven Morrissey]], a singer with the short-lived punk band [[the Nosebleeds]]. Marr approached a mutual friend asking to be introduced and they visited Morrissey at his house in Kings Road, [[Stretford]] in May.{{sfn|Rogan|1994|p=37}}\n\nMarr's [[Jangle pop|jangly]] [[Rickenbacker]] and [[Fender Telecaster]] guitar playing became synonymous with the Smiths' sound. Marr's friend [[Andy Rourke]] joined as bass player and [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] was recruited as drummer. Signing to [[Independent record label|indie label]] [[Rough Trade Records]], they released their first single, \"[[Hand in Glove]]\", on 13 May 1983. By February 1984, the Smiths' fanbase was sufficiently large to launch the band's long-awaited [[The Smiths (album)|eponymous debut album]] to number two in the UK chart. Early in 1985, the band released their second album, ''[[Meat Is Murder]]''. This was more strident and political than its predecessor, and it was the band's only album (barring compilations) to reach number one in the UK charts. During 1985 the band completed lengthy tours of the UK and the US while recording the next studio record, ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]''.\n\nIn 1989 ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine rated ''The Queen is Dead'' as number one of \"The Greatest Albums Ever Made\". Spin was not alone in this designation\u2014numerous periodicals rank the Smiths and their albums, especially ''The Queen is Dead'', high on their best ever lists. ''[[NME]]'', for example, has dubbed the Smiths the most important rock band of all time. A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told ''NME'', \"'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit... dangerous.

In 1696, Samuel M\u00f6rt, a bookkeeper of the [[Kengis]] works, wrote on rumours about the presence of iron in the two hills.<ref name=Kummu96>Kummu 1997, p. 96.</ref> The ore became better known after it was reported by Mangi, a Sami man, in 1736 to Swedish authorities that had gathered in [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi|Jukkasj\u00e4rvi Church]].<ref name=Kummu96/> Soon after the reported finding Swedish senior enforcement officer and cartographer and mapper [[Anders Hackzell]] mapped the Kiruna area in 1736 and gave the mountains of the area their Swedish language names ''Fredriks berg'' (original Finnish name still in use as well: Kiirunavaara) and ''Berget Ulrika Eleonora'' (original Finnish name still in use as well: Luossavaara), after the King of Sweden [[Frederick I of Sweden|Fredrik I]] and his wife [[Ulrika Eleonora]].<ref name=Kummu96/>\n\nDespite the findings of large amounts of ore, no mining was initiated because of the remote location and the harsh climate. Some ore was extracted in the 19th century. It was extracted in summer and transported in winter, using sleds drawn by [[reindeer]] and [[horse]]s. However, the costs were high and the quality of the [[phosphorus]] ore poor, until, in 1878, the [[Gilchrist-Thomas process]], invented by [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] and [[Percy Gilchrist]], allowed for the separation of phosphorus from the ore.<ref name=\"kirunakommun\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kommun.kiruna.se/Om-kommunen/Allmant-om-kommunen/Historia/|title=Historia \u2013 Kiruna kommun|accessdate=2009-02-09|language=Swedish |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625030922/http://www.kommun.kiruna.se/Om-kommunen/Allmant-om-kommunen/Historia/ |archivedate = June 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"lkab\">{{cite web|url=http://lkab.com/?openform&id=77DE|title=Press room/History/1696\u20131919@lkab.com|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref>\n\n[[File:IORE Vassijaure.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Iore]]-hauled train passing Vassijaure]]\n\nIn 1884, a concession for a railway from [[Lule\u00e5]] to [[Narvik]] was granted to ''The Northern of Europe Railway Company''. The provisional railway between Lule\u00e5 and [[Malmberget]] was finished in 1888 and the first train left Malmberget in March. Around the same time, the English company went bankrupt and had to sell the line to the Swedish state for 8 million [[Swedish crown]]s, around half the amount initially invested. After a significant rebuild, the railway to G\u00e4llivare could be used again and iron ore was extracted at [[Malmberget]] by Aktiebolaget Gellivare Malmf\u00e4lt (AGM).<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Gruvstaden \u2013 Gruvorna |last=Barck |first=\u00c5ke |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=60\u201374 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nAt the initiative of Robert Schoug, the [[LKAB|Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag]] (LKAB) was founded in 1890. In 1893, Gustaf Broms became CEO of both LKAB and AGM. LKAB pressed for continuing [[Malmbanan]] via Luossavaara and Kiirunavaara to the ice-free coast of Norway. The continuation of the railway line to [[Narvik]] was controversial, because opponents feared the influence of [[Russia]] (then controlling [[Finland]] and already connected to Sweden at [[Haparanda]]\u2013[[Tornio]]) on an international railway line.\n[[File:Kiruna stadshus 1.JPG|thumb|right|Kiruna City Hall in summer]]\n\nThe decision to build was finally taken in 1898. The railway came to Kiruna 15 October 1899 and the Swedish and Norwegian sections were joined 15 November 1902. For LKAB, the great expense almost led to bankruptcy in 1901, just after the ore mining at Kiirunavaara had started. [[King Oscar II]] only opened the railway line 14 July 1903, preferring summer over winter to travel north.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100komm\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Komunikationer \u2013 Fr\u00e5n h\u00e4stskuts till e-post |last=Theander |first=Agge |last2=Aidenp\u00e4\u00e4 |first2=Elis |last3=Bergstr\u00f6m  |first3=Rolf  |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=132\u2013147 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nThe architects Per Olof Hallman and Gustaf Wickman were appointed to design the city, to be built at Haukivaara, near both iron ore mines, with then-revolutionary consideration of geographical and climatological circumstances; being built on a hill, winter temperatures are much milder than in other towns, and due to the street plan and the positioning, wind is limited. On 27 April 1900, Hallman's plan was officially accepted.\n\nGustaf Broms proposed to name the settlements ''Kiruna'', a short and practical name that could also be pronounced by Swedish speaking inhabitants. The name means [[rock ptarmigan]] in Lappish and Finnish. LKAB appointed [[Hjalmar Lundbohm]], who had finished neither high school nor his geology studies, as local manager in Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100early\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Kiruna \u2013 Fr\u00e5n \u00f6demark till stad |last=Persson |first=Curt |author2=Jan-Erik Johansson  |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=27&ndash;43 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref name=\"kiruna100hl\">{{cite book|title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Kiruna \u2013 Hjalmar Lundbohm |last=Persson |first=Curt |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=50&ndash;57 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref name=\"wintercity\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wintercities.kiruna.se/nytt/technicaltours.htm|title=Kiruna \u2013 technical visits|accessdate=2009-02-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220084615/http://www.wintercities.kiruna.se/nytt/technicaltours.htm|archivedate=2012-02-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Kiruna befolkningsutveckling 1900\u20132000.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Population development in Kiruna town]]\n[[File:Aurora 3 in Kiruna.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Aurora taken from the suburb of Kiruna]]\n\nBefore the design for the settlement had been accepted, houses were built in a disorganized manner with illegal [[slum]]s similar to those in the other mining town, [[Malmberget]], {{convert|80|km}} south of Kiruna. Also, provisional buildings served as a church, a school, a hospital, a hotel and a police station. However, official residences were built at a high pace, and when the king opened the railway in 1903, all illegal residences and most other provisional buildings had been demolished and replaced. The very first building, ''B:1'', is preserved and can be seen at ''Hjalmar Lundbohmsg\u00e5rden''. In 1899, 18 people were registered as living in soon-to-be Kiruna.\nThis increased to 222 in 1900, 7,438 in 1910 and 12,884 in 1930.\n\nThe residences did not fully keep up with this rapid growth; by 1910, there were 1,877 official rooms and some unrecognised residences, which meant that an average of three to four people lived in a single room; this density decreased steadily during the decades to follow. Kiruna became a municipalsamh\u00e4lle (a community within a municipality) in 1908. This caused unhappiness in local organisations, such as ''Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Arbetaref\u00f6rening'', that had hoped for status as [[k\u00f6ping]], which would have kept more of the mining income inside the locality. In return, the mining company LKAB paid for a hospital, fire station, sewage, roads, a church (opened 1912) and the priest's home.<ref name=\"kirunakommun\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100early\" />\n\n[[File:Church of Kiruna 2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kiruna Church]]]]\nIn April 1907, a [[tram]] began operation in Kiruna, the northernmost in the world. This meant miners would no longer have to walk several kilometres through the sub-arctic cold, nor would they need to climb a hundred meters up the mining hill. The network consisted of three lines: ''bergbanan'' ([[funicular]]), ''stadssp\u00e5rv\u00e4gen'' (city tramway) and ''gruvsp\u00e5rv\u00e4gen'' (mine tramway). The funicular closed in 1955 after a road up the mine was built 1949. The city line had a maximum length of {{convert|8|km}} and was unique due to the [[narrow gauge|1-meter gauge]], double windows and heated wagons. It closed in 1958 after gradually being replaced by buses. Between 1941 and 1964, a tram was used inside the mine, with wagons bought from closed tramlines throughout Sweden.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nThe iron ore industry was good in the early 20th century. Before the start of the work, Hjalmar Lundbohm worried whether the Kiruna winter would allow for working outside at all, but despite early research into underground mining, [[mountaintop removal mining]] was the primary method in the early years. Mechanisation was attempted early using [[steam power]]ed excavators, but the cold climate led to considerable difficulties and only when electrical machinery became available in the 1910s, significant mechanisation was achieved. The peak of [[Kiirunavaara]], ''Statsr\u00e5det'', was {{convert|247.7|m}} above [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] until it was spectacularly blown off in 1910.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nA general strike hit Sweden in 1909 and Kiruna was no exception. Hoping for a better future, thousands of people left Kiruna, including a group of 500 inhabitants emigrating to Brazil. Most of them returned, disappointed that life in [[Latin America]] was not what they had hoped it to be, Hjalmar Lundbohm personally lent money for the trip home to some of the emigrants.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nDuring [[World War I]], iron ore production dropped to the lowest level in LKAB's history, and when exports increased again, a successful three-month strike in 1920 led to a 20% increase in salaries for the miners. Production dropped to a minimum in 1922 and a three-day work week was introduced, but during the ''fabulous twenties'', it increased to a record nine million tonnes in 1927.<ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nIn 1921, mining started at Kiruna's other hill, [[Luossavaara]]. However, the total amount of ore that could be mined in [[open pit mining]] here was small compared to Kiirunavaara, and LKAB preferred to concentrate resources in one place. Nevertheless, mining here continued until 1974 and later it became a research mine.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /> While 19th-century mining in Kiruna had focused on Loussavaara the large-scale operation of LKAB focused on the Kiruna ore proper because it was both larger and not subject to legal restrictions that mandate Loussavaara ore to be refined in Sweden.<ref name=Hansson2015-212>Hansson 2015, p. 212.</ref>\n\nDuring the first decades of Kiruna's existence, no road connected it to the outside world. The only connection was by railway or, as in the time before the railway, by boat (in summer) via the [[Torne river|Torne]] and [[Kalix river|Kalix]] rivers to [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]] and H\u00e5moj\u00e5kk and then proceed by foot. A road from Kiruna was built to Tuolluvaara in 1901, Poikkij\u00e4rvi in 1909, Alttaj\u00e4rvi in 1913 and connected to [[Svappavaara]] in 1926, from where roads already connected via [[Vittangi]] to [[Pajala]] and via Lappesuando to [[G\u00e4llivare]] and further south.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] led to a 70% drop in ore production, a drop that would turn into a dramatic increase on the eve of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nAlthough some tourists had already started coming to the area in the 19th century, the completion of the railway line truly made tourism possible. Tourists came for the rivers and the mountains, but also geologists and entire classes of students came to see the mine. Additionally, a yearly winter sports festival was started, which attracted people from a wide area. The Sami population was already a tourist attraction in the early days of Kiruna's existence.<ref name=\"kiruna100turism\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Turismen |last=Barck |first=\u00c5ke |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=60\u201374 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\n{{See also|Swedish iron ore during World War II}}\n\nThe municipality of Kiruna shares borders with Norway and Finland and Kiruna is located relatively close to both countries. This led to many soldiers being transported to the area whenever mobilisation was requested; first in September 1939 after the German [[invasion of Poland]], then in November 1939 after the [[Winter War|Russian invasion of Finland]], but in both cases, Swedish soldiers did not engage in any fighting. In March 1940, Churchill requested permission to transport soldiers from Narvik in Norway to Finland via Kiruna and Haparanda in ''[[Operation Catherine]]''. Out of fear that the presence of British soldiers near the Kiruna ore mine would provoke a German attack on Sweden, the request was declined.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=I skuggan av krigen|last=Theander |first=Agge|last2=Roth |first2=Thomas |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=234\u2013250 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]], at least ten soldiers were stationed along every bridge along [[Malmbanan]], to blow up the bridges should the German army invade Sweden. Additionally, foreigners were banned from visiting Kiruna or the iron ore line, and only the [[Sami people|Sami]], military personnel, locals and people working for the government were permitted to travel between Kiruna and Riksgr\u00e4nsen.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nAfter [[Battles of Narvik|the battle]] at [[Bj\u00f8rnfjell, Nordland|Bj\u00f8rnfjell]], 15 April 1940, wounded and fallen Norwegian soldiers were transported to Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nDespite the conditions for [[Sweden during World War II|Swedish neutrality]], rail cars with food, skis and helmets were transported from Kiruna to the Norwegian soldiers in Bj\u00f8rnfjell.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nSwedish iron ore from Kiruna was of major importance to the German war machine. A group of people working at LKAB organised in the Wollweberliga, planning to sabotage transports to Germany. In late November 1941, Edvard Nyberg, [[Ernst Wollweber]] and others produced a mine to be attached to the ore cars. Nyberg was caught, was fired from LKAB and spent 3\u00bd years in prison. Upon his release, he founded ''Nybergs Mekaniska Verkstad'' which is still one of Kiruna's biggest companies.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybergsmek.se/|title=Start - NMV Group|website=NMV Group}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nsd.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleId=4386753|language=Swedish|title=De fick prestigefyllt pris |first=Hans |last=Sternlund|work=Norrl\u00e4ndska Socialdemokraterna|accessdate=22 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nGermany requested that Sweden provide use of the railway network to transport military equipment, but the Swedish government agreed only to ''transitering av human karakt\u00e4r, men ej underh\u00e5ll till stridande trupp'' (transit of humanitarian character, but no supply of fighting soldiers). Germany argued that, now that Norway was occupied, the German soldiers there were no longer fighting, and thus transported a large amount of military equipment, ammunition and, secretly, troops from southern to northern Norway, via Malmbanan and Kiruna. Troops were often transported in transports declared as material transports. Despite being strictly against the rules, there was considerable interaction between the German soldiers and the Swedish locals, including trading and football matches.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nDuring the war, up to 2000 refugees from 20 countries were kept in Kiruna. German prisoners of war, for example, from crashed airplanes, were kept in Kiruna before being transported south. However, small-scale sabotage, such as sand in the engines, was common and loose weapons often ended up at the bottom of the Luossaj\u00e4rvi lake, next to the railway stop.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nNorth of Tornetr\u00e4sk, at Kaivare, a radio base ''Kari'' was built in secrecy and used by the Norwegian resistance. It was also used for the smuggling of arms to Norway and refugees from Norway.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.internationalen.se/print.php?news.3067|work=Internationalen|title=Sverige, USA, FRA och signalspaning|last=Svensson|first=Anders|date=11 July 2008|accessdate=22 February 2009|language=Swedish}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-war ===\n[[File:Kiruna-sentrum.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An old mansion near Kiruna centrum]]\n\nIn 1948, Kiruna gained city rights and started to receive large amounts of money from the mine. The city centre was renovated starting in 1953; most buildings built before 1920 were demolished and replaced, and many of the current buildings were built in the following period. The town grew and new neighborhoods were built, as well as new apartment buildings and villas in existing neighborhoods. The area is currently known as ''Lombolo'' was built in the 1960s.<ref name=\"kiruna100early\" />\n\nAfter World War II, the economy of Kiruna started to diversify. Initially, the mechanisation of the mining industry led to more mechanical workshops developing machinery for the mine, still dependent on the mining, but individual companies with spinoffs that could be sold to other areas than the Kiruna mine alone. In the 1950s, a fund, ''Norrlandsfonden'' was established, in which profits from LKAB would be invested in order to diversify the local economy. The municipality started to lend money to starting companies against very beneficial rates, a scheme that lasted until 1959 because the banks, that insisted this was false competition, had established more relaxed rules for lending out money. The industrial area east of the city was built in the 1950s to separate industry from neighborhoods.<ref name=\"kiruna100aktillit\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Fr\u00e5n AK till IT|last=Nilsson|first=Kjell|date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |page=86&ndash;90 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 November 1960, [[Kiruna Airport]] opened to separate civilian air traffic from the military airplanes that had landed at Kalixfors airport and at [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] since World War I. A road to [[Nikkaluokta]] was opened in 1971 and to [[Riksgr\u00e4nsen]] and [[Narvik]] in 1984. The latter had been debated heavily, for alternative plans existed to build the road to Norway on the northern side of [[Tornetr\u00e4sk]], via Laimo, Kattuvuoma, [[Salmi (rural locality)|Salmi]] to Innset and [[Bardu]] in Norway. This road was never built, but a 25&nbsp;km long track between Laimo and Salmi was built at the initiatives of the locals and finished in 1962; however, this track, called Talmav\u00e4gen, is not connected to any other road.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nIncreased communications were also beneficial for tourism. [[Swedish Railways]] had already run special trains before World War II, but started a special Dollar train in the summer months between [[Gothenburg]] and Kiruna, connecting to cruise ships from the [[United States]]. The canoe club Kiruna L\u00e5ngf\u00e4rdspaddlare was founded in 1972 and rafting for tourists restarted after it had been discontinued for 20 years due to the drowning of Valfrid Johansson. Until the 1980s, tourism had been mainly a summer business, but touristic exploitation of dog sledging was started in 1983 in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi. In 1990, the first [[Icehotel]] was built in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi and advertised as the world's largest igloo. It had been built using techniques from the building of [[Malmbanan]] 90 years before and was also inspired by the Snow Festival, that had started in 1986 to celebrate the Swedish [[Viking (satellite)|Viking]] satellite. Since 1998, a special tourist area exists in the mine and since 1999, tourists can visit the various areas of research going on in Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100turism\" />\n\nIn 1957, the ''Kiruna Geophysical Observatory'' (KGO) (now the [[Swedish Institute of Space Physics]]) was founded and established by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. [[Esrange]] Space Centre is established in 1966. Here, rocket operations and ground-based observations are carried out since 1966, balloon operations since 1974, satellite operations since 1978 and testing operations since 2000 (with the [[Swedish Defence Material Administration]]). ESA has operated a satellite station at Salmaj\u00e4rvi, near Esrange, since 1989. In 1987, [[Ume\u00e5 University]] started a space engineering program in Kiruna, and [[GIS]] education was started by [[Lule\u00e5 University of Technology]] in 1991. In 1993, The Ume\u00e5 space engineers moved to the same building housing IRF and a year later another Lule\u00e5 University programme, civil engineering with specialisation in space technology, started at the same location. Since 2006, the ''Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Space Science and Technology'' has started with at least one semester spent at LTU. In 2007, education along IRV was split and only the Department of Space Science, belonging to Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, remained, while the Ume\u00e5 University programme in Space Engineering quit.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"irf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irf.se/Overview/?dbfile=About_Kiruna&dbsec=Administration&chosen=overview|title=Overview \u2013 Swedish Institute of Space Physics|accessdate=2009-02-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220183342/http://www.irf.se/Overview/?dbfile=About_Kiruna&dbsec=Administration&chosen=overview|archivedate=2008-12-20}}</ref><ref name=\"esrange\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.se/?id=5998|title=Esrange space centre \u2013 history|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref><ref name=\"kiruna100rymd\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Rymd, milj\u00f6 och gruva|last=Theander|first=Agge|date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |page=116&ndash;129 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Icehotel-se-04.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|ice hotel in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]]]]\n\nThe Kiruna [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|Icehotel]] has been built in [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]] each winter since 1990 and is a major tourist attraction.<ref name=\"icehotel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icehotel.com/|title=ICEHOTEL|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Moving the town ===\nThe re-development of Kiruna is a reconstruction project, as the Kirunavaara mine, run by [[LKAB]], undermines the current town center.

The city centre is built on the Haukavaara hill at an altitude of 530 m, high above the [[Torne river]] to the north and the [[Kalix river]] to the south. Other parts of the town are Lombolo and Tuolluvaara. Near Kiruna are the mountains [[Kiirunavaara]] and [[Luossavaara]]. Kiirunavaara is an iron ore mine that is the town's primary economic resource. Luossavaara is a former mine and now used as a skiing slope.\n\nThe city is built near the lake [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] with outflow to the Luossajoki that flows in the [[Torne river]] at Laxforsen. The area around Kiruna is very sparsely populated. The northwest, west and southwest of Kiruna are dominated by the [[Scandinavian mountains]], visible from the city centre. Sweden's highest mountain, [[Kebnekaise]], is {{convert|75|km|mi}} from the city centre and can be seen from it as well.

The land north of Kurravaara is roadless, uninhabited, partly barren and partly birch forest, up to the Norwegian and [[Finland|Finnish]] borders at [[Treriksr\u00f6set]]. The lower-lying east is dominated by boreal forest, stretching hundreds (if not thousands) of kilometers into Finland and [[Russia]]. Around 15&nbsp;km east of Kiruna is a group of villages at the Torne River, most notably [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]], where an [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|ice hotel]] is built in winter, attracting tourists from all over the world. The twin cities [[G\u00e4llivare]] and [[Malmberget]] are some 120&nbsp;km south of Kiruna.\n\nKiruna became a [[Stad (Sweden)|Swedish city]] on January 1, 1948, and was at one time listed as the largest city in the world by area,<ref>{{Cite web| title=Historien om v\u00e4rldens st\u00f6rsta stad| url=http://www.nsd.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleID=3597686| language=Swedish| publisher=[[Norrl\u00e4ndska Socialdemokraten]]| accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> even if most of its territory was non-urban. After the Swedish [[municipalities of Sweden|municipality reform]] in the 1970s, the term \"city\" has been legally discontinued. Today only the built-up area is considered a ''[[de facto]]'' city.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeing located 145&nbsp;km (90 miles) north of the [[Arctic Circle]], Kiruna has a [[subarctic climate|subarctic]]  (''Dfc'') climate with short, cool summers and long, cold winters, although the city itself can be considerably milder than the surrounding forest. Snow cover generally lasts from late September to mid-May, but snowfall can occur year-round. The [[midnight sun|sun does not set]] between 28 May and 16 July (50 days), and white nights lasts from early May to early August. [[polar night|The period that the sun does not rise]] lasts from 11 December to 1 January (22 days), the exact boundaries depending on local topography. Even though Kiruna's winters are very cold by Swedish standards, they are still much less severe than winters on similar latitudes in [[North America]] and [[Siberia]], and even more southerly areas in other parts of the world due to some maritime influence. Similar winter temperatures go as far south as below the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] in the [[Russian Far East]]. Kiruna however, has cooler summers than such areas, but still warm enough to stay above polar climate and below the northern [[tree line]]. Winter temperatures however are significantly colder than areas immediately affected by the [[Gulf Stream]] such, where in fact the regular lows of Kiruna during January and February are colder than or similar to [[Troms\u00f8]]'s [[Troms\u00f8#Climate|all-time record low]].\n\nThe coldest confirmed temperature ever in Kiruna was recorded at the nearby weather station with {{convert|-43.3|C|F}} recorded in January 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?91867|title=Temperature and Wind for January 2015 - All Time Records section|publisher=Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|accessdate=20 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016183657/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?91867|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The weather station recorded {{convert|31.6|C|F}} in July 1945, which is the all-time record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul14.pdf?715|title=Temperature and Wind for July 2014 - All Time Records section|publisher=Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|accessdate=20 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016183657/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul14.pdf?715|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The warmest month on record at the weather station was July 2018, with average high temperatures of {{convert|24.3|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul18.pdf?66120|title=July 2018 Temperature & Wind|language=sv|publisher=SMHI|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref> Kiruna has a gloomy climate, affected by Atlantic low-pressure systems.

A short road connects to Kurravaara at the Torne river and ends there. Another road connects Kiruna with [[Nikkaluokta]] close to [[Kebnekaise]] and is used by tourists to get to the mountains. It passes by or nearby several villages in the Kalix river valley.\n\nBuses connect Kiruna with major towns in [[Norrbotten]] province and villages nearby and in the wider region. The [[Malmbanan|railway]] connects Lule\u00e5 with G\u00e4llivare, Kiruna and Narvik. Although built to serve the mine, [[SJ AB|Swedish Rail]] runs daily passenger traffic on the line: a night train from Narvik to [[Stockholm]], a day train from Narvik to Lule\u00e5 (connecting with a second night train to Stockholm and [[Gothenburg]]), and trains to Lule\u00e5 and Narvik that start and finish in Kiruna. The latter is known as ''Karven'' and popular for day trips to the mountains near Abisko, Bj\u00f6rkliden and [[Riksgr\u00e4nsen]], particularly in winter. Additional long-distance trains are run by [[Transdev]] in summer.\nIn 2013, the railway station was moved 2&nbsp;km away from the city centre, so walking is possible but not recommended. There is a free shuttlebus for every departure and arrival which starts from Kiruna bustation in the city centre.\n\n[[Kiruna Airport]] is southeast of the city, 8&nbsp;km by road. A few daily flights connect Kiruna with Stockholm, either directly or via Lule\u00e5 or [[Ume\u00e5]]. An airport bus is available for most Stockholm-Arlanda flights and starting from end of August 2015 the airport bus will be available for all flights to/from Stockholm-Arlanda.

In 1696, Samuel M\u00f6rt, a bookkeeper of the [[Kengis]] works, wrote on rumours about the presence of iron in the two hills.<ref name=Kummu96>Kummu 1997, p. 96.</ref> The ore became better known after it was reported by Mangi, a Sami man, in 1736 to Swedish authorities that had gathered in [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi|Jukkasj\u00e4rvi Church]].<ref name=Kummu96/> Soon after the reported finding Swedish senior enforcement officer and cartographer and mapper [[Anders Hackzell]] mapped the Kiruna area in 1736 and gave the mountains of the area their Swedish language names ''Fredriks berg'' (original Finnish name still in use as well: Kiirunavaara) and ''Berget Ulrika Eleonora'' (original Finnish name still in use as well: Luossavaara), after the King of Sweden [[Frederick I of Sweden|Fredrik I]] and his wife [[Ulrika Eleonora]].<ref name=Kummu96/>\n\nDespite the findings of large amounts of ore, no mining was initiated because of the remote location and the harsh climate. Some ore was extracted in the 19th century. It was extracted in summer and transported in winter, using sleds drawn by [[reindeer]] and [[horse]]s. However, the costs were high and the quality of the [[phosphorus]] ore poor, until, in 1878, the [[Gilchrist-Thomas process]], invented by [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] and [[Percy Gilchrist]], allowed for the separation of phosphorus from the ore.<ref name=\"kirunakommun\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kommun.kiruna.se/Om-kommunen/Allmant-om-kommunen/Historia/|title=Historia \u2013 Kiruna kommun|accessdate=2009-02-09|language=Swedish |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625030922/http://www.kommun.kiruna.se/Om-kommunen/Allmant-om-kommunen/Historia/ |archivedate = June 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"lkab\">{{cite web|url=http://lkab.com/?openform&id=77DE|title=Press room/History/1696\u20131919@lkab.com|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref>\n\n[[File:IORE Vassijaure.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Iore]]-hauled train passing Vassijaure]]\n\nIn 1884, a concession for a railway from [[Lule\u00e5]] to [[Narvik]] was granted to ''The Northern of Europe Railway Company''. The provisional railway between Lule\u00e5 and [[Malmberget]] was finished in 1888 and the first train left Malmberget in March. Around the same time, the English company went bankrupt and had to sell the line to the Swedish state for 8 million [[Swedish crown]]s, around half the amount initially invested. After a significant rebuild, the railway to G\u00e4llivare could be used again and iron ore was extracted at [[Malmberget]] by Aktiebolaget Gellivare Malmf\u00e4lt (AGM).<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Gruvstaden \u2013 Gruvorna |last=Barck |first=\u00c5ke |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=60\u201374 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nAt the initiative of Robert Schoug, the [[LKAB|Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag]] (LKAB) was founded in 1890. In 1893, Gustaf Broms became CEO of both LKAB and AGM. LKAB pressed for continuing [[Malmbanan]] via Luossavaara and Kiirunavaara to the ice-free coast of Norway. The continuation of the railway line to [[Narvik]] was controversial, because opponents feared the influence of [[Russia]] (then controlling [[Finland]] and already connected to Sweden at [[Haparanda]]\u2013[[Tornio]]) on an international railway line.\n[[File:Kiruna stadshus 1.JPG|thumb|right|Kiruna City Hall in summer]]\n\nThe decision to build was finally taken in 1898. The railway came to Kiruna 15 October 1899 and the Swedish and Norwegian sections were joined 15 November 1902. For LKAB, the great expense almost led to bankruptcy in 1901, just after the ore mining at Kiirunavaara had started. [[King Oscar II]] only opened the railway line 14 July 1903, preferring summer over winter to travel north.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100komm\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Komunikationer \u2013 Fr\u00e5n h\u00e4stskuts till e-post |last=Theander |first=Agge |last2=Aidenp\u00e4\u00e4 |first2=Elis |last3=Bergstr\u00f6m  |first3=Rolf  |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=132\u2013147 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nThe architects Per Olof Hallman and Gustaf Wickman were appointed to design the city, to be built at Haukivaara, near both iron ore mines, with then-revolutionary consideration of geographical and climatological circumstances; being built on a hill, winter temperatures are much milder than in other towns, and due to the street plan and the positioning, wind is limited. On 27 April 1900, Hallman's plan was officially accepted.\n\nGustaf Broms proposed to name the settlements ''Kiruna'', a short and practical name that could also be pronounced by Swedish speaking inhabitants. The name means [[rock ptarmigan]] in Lappish and Finnish. LKAB appointed [[Hjalmar Lundbohm]], who had finished neither high school nor his geology studies, as local manager in Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100early\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Kiruna \u2013 Fr\u00e5n \u00f6demark till stad |last=Persson |first=Curt |author2=Jan-Erik Johansson  |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=27&ndash;43 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref name=\"kiruna100hl\">{{cite book|title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=Kiruna \u2013 Hjalmar Lundbohm |last=Persson |first=Curt |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=50&ndash;57 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref name=\"wintercity\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wintercities.kiruna.se/nytt/technicaltours.htm|title=Kiruna \u2013 technical visits|accessdate=2009-02-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220084615/http://www.wintercities.kiruna.se/nytt/technicaltours.htm|archivedate=2012-02-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Kiruna befolkningsutveckling 1900\u20132000.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Population development in Kiruna town]]\n[[File:Aurora 3 in Kiruna.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Aurora taken from the suburb of Kiruna]]\n\nBefore the design for the settlement had been accepted, houses were built in a disorganized manner with illegal [[slum]]s similar to those in the other mining town, [[Malmberget]], {{convert|80|km}} south of Kiruna. Also, provisional buildings served as a church, a school, a hospital, a hotel and a police station. However, official residences were built at a high pace, and when the king opened the railway in 1903, all illegal residences and most other provisional buildings had been demolished and replaced. The very first building, ''B:1'', is preserved and can be seen at ''Hjalmar Lundbohmsg\u00e5rden''. In 1899, 18 people were registered as living in soon-to-be Kiruna.\nThis increased to 222 in 1900, 7,438 in 1910 and 12,884 in 1930.\n\nThe residences did not fully keep up with this rapid growth; by 1910, there were 1,877 official rooms and some unrecognised residences, which meant that an average of three to four people lived in a single room; this density decreased steadily during the decades to follow. Kiruna became a municipalsamh\u00e4lle (a community within a municipality) in 1908. This caused unhappiness in local organisations, such as ''Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Arbetaref\u00f6rening'', that had hoped for status as [[k\u00f6ping]], which would have kept more of the mining income inside the locality. In return, the mining company LKAB paid for a hospital, fire station, sewage, roads, a church (opened 1912) and the priest's home.<ref name=\"kirunakommun\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100early\" />\n\n[[File:Church of Kiruna 2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kiruna Church]]]]\nIn April 1907, a [[tram]] began operation in Kiruna, the northernmost in the world. This meant miners would no longer have to walk several kilometres through the sub-arctic cold, nor would they need to climb a hundred meters up the mining hill. The network consisted of three lines: ''bergbanan'' ([[funicular]]), ''stadssp\u00e5rv\u00e4gen'' (city tramway) and ''gruvsp\u00e5rv\u00e4gen'' (mine tramway). The funicular closed in 1955 after a road up the mine was built 1949. The city line had a maximum length of {{convert|8|km}} and was unique due to the [[narrow gauge|1-meter gauge]], double windows and heated wagons. It closed in 1958 after gradually being replaced by buses. Between 1941 and 1964, a tram was used inside the mine, with wagons bought from closed tramlines throughout Sweden.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nThe iron ore industry was good in the early 20th century. Before the start of the work, Hjalmar Lundbohm worried whether the Kiruna winter would allow for working outside at all, but despite early research into underground mining, [[mountaintop removal mining]] was the primary method in the early years. Mechanisation was attempted early using [[steam power]]ed excavators, but the cold climate led to considerable difficulties and only when electrical machinery became available in the 1910s, significant mechanisation was achieved. The peak of [[Kiirunavaara]], ''Statsr\u00e5det'', was {{convert|247.7|m}} above [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] until it was spectacularly blown off in 1910.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nA general strike hit Sweden in 1909 and Kiruna was no exception. Hoping for a better future, thousands of people left Kiruna, including a group of 500 inhabitants emigrating to Brazil. Most of them returned, disappointed that life in [[Latin America]] was not what they had hoped it to be, Hjalmar Lundbohm personally lent money for the trip home to some of the emigrants.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nDuring [[World War I]], iron ore production dropped to the lowest level in LKAB's history, and when exports increased again, a successful three-month strike in 1920 led to a 20% increase in salaries for the miners. Production dropped to a minimum in 1922 and a three-day work week was introduced, but during the ''fabulous twenties'', it increased to a record nine million tonnes in 1927.<ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nIn 1921, mining started at Kiruna's other hill, [[Luossavaara]]. However, the total amount of ore that could be mined in [[open pit mining]] here was small compared to Kiirunavaara, and LKAB preferred to concentrate resources in one place. Nevertheless, mining here continued until 1974 and later it became a research mine.<ref name=\"lkab\" /><ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" /> While 19th-century mining in Kiruna had focused on Loussavaara the large-scale operation of LKAB focused on the Kiruna ore proper because it was both larger and not subject to legal restrictions that mandate Loussavaara ore to be refined in Sweden.<ref name=Hansson2015-212>Hansson 2015, p. 212.</ref>\n\nDuring the first decades of Kiruna's existence, no road connected it to the outside world. The only connection was by railway or, as in the time before the railway, by boat (in summer) via the [[Torne river|Torne]] and [[Kalix river|Kalix]] rivers to [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]] and H\u00e5moj\u00e5kk and then proceed by foot. A road from Kiruna was built to Tuolluvaara in 1901, Poikkij\u00e4rvi in 1909, Alttaj\u00e4rvi in 1913 and connected to [[Svappavaara]] in 1926, from where roads already connected via [[Vittangi]] to [[Pajala]] and via Lappesuando to [[G\u00e4llivare]] and further south.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] led to a 70% drop in ore production, a drop that would turn into a dramatic increase on the eve of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"kiruna100gruv\" />\n\nAlthough some tourists had already started coming to the area in the 19th century, the completion of the railway line truly made tourism possible. Tourists came for the rivers and the mountains, but also geologists and entire classes of students came to see the mine. Additionally, a yearly winter sports festival was started, which attracted people from a wide area. The Sami population was already a tourist attraction in the early days of Kiruna's existence.<ref name=\"kiruna100turism\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Turismen |last=Barck |first=\u00c5ke |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=60\u201374 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\n{{See also|Swedish iron ore during World War II}}\n\nThe municipality of Kiruna shares borders with Norway and Finland and Kiruna is located relatively close to both countries. This led to many soldiers being transported to the area whenever mobilisation was requested; first in September 1939 after the German [[invasion of Poland]], then in November 1939 after the [[Winter War|Russian invasion of Finland]], but in both cases, Swedish soldiers did not engage in any fighting. In March 1940, Churchill requested permission to transport soldiers from Narvik in Norway to Finland via Kiruna and Haparanda in ''[[Operation Catherine]]''. Out of fear that the presence of British soldiers near the Kiruna ore mine would provoke a German attack on Sweden, the request was declined.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=I skuggan av krigen|last=Theander |first=Agge|last2=Roth |first2=Thomas |date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |pages=234\u2013250 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]], at least ten soldiers were stationed along every bridge along [[Malmbanan]], to blow up the bridges should the German army invade Sweden. Additionally, foreigners were banned from visiting Kiruna or the iron ore line, and only the [[Sami people|Sami]], military personnel, locals and people working for the government were permitted to travel between Kiruna and Riksgr\u00e4nsen.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nAfter [[Battles of Narvik|the battle]] at [[Bj\u00f8rnfjell, Nordland|Bj\u00f8rnfjell]], 15 April 1940, wounded and fallen Norwegian soldiers were transported to Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nDespite the conditions for [[Sweden during World War II|Swedish neutrality]], rail cars with food, skis and helmets were transported from Kiruna to the Norwegian soldiers in Bj\u00f8rnfjell.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nSwedish iron ore from Kiruna was of major importance to the German war machine. A group of people working at LKAB organised in the Wollweberliga, planning to sabotage transports to Germany. In late November 1941, Edvard Nyberg, [[Ernst Wollweber]] and others produced a mine to be attached to the ore cars. Nyberg was caught, was fired from LKAB and spent 3\u00bd years in prison. Upon his release, he founded ''Nybergs Mekaniska Verkstad'' which is still one of Kiruna's biggest companies.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybergsmek.se/|title=Start - NMV Group|website=NMV Group}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nsd.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleId=4386753|language=Swedish|title=De fick prestigefyllt pris |first=Hans |last=Sternlund|work=Norrl\u00e4ndska Socialdemokraterna|accessdate=22 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nGermany requested that Sweden provide use of the railway network to transport military equipment, but the Swedish government agreed only to ''transitering av human karakt\u00e4r, men ej underh\u00e5ll till stridande trupp'' (transit of humanitarian character, but no supply of fighting soldiers). Germany argued that, now that Norway was occupied, the German soldiers there were no longer fighting, and thus transported a large amount of military equipment, ammunition and, secretly, troops from southern to northern Norway, via Malmbanan and Kiruna. Troops were often transported in transports declared as material transports. Despite being strictly against the rules, there was considerable interaction between the German soldiers and the Swedish locals, including trading and football matches.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nDuring the war, up to 2000 refugees from 20 countries were kept in Kiruna. German prisoners of war, for example, from crashed airplanes, were kept in Kiruna before being transported south. However, small-scale sabotage, such as sand in the engines, was common and loose weapons often ended up at the bottom of the Luossaj\u00e4rvi lake, next to the railway stop.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" />\n\nNorth of Tornetr\u00e4sk, at Kaivare, a radio base ''Kari'' was built in secrecy and used by the Norwegian resistance. It was also used for the smuggling of arms to Norway and refugees from Norway.<ref name=\"kiruna100war\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.internationalen.se/print.php?news.3067|work=Internationalen|title=Sverige, USA, FRA och signalspaning|last=Svensson|first=Anders|date=11 July 2008|accessdate=22 February 2009|language=Swedish}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-war ===\n[[File:Kiruna-sentrum.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An old mansion near Kiruna centrum]]\n\nIn 1948, Kiruna gained city rights and started to receive large amounts of money from the mine. The city centre was renovated starting in 1953; most buildings built before 1920 were demolished and replaced, and many of the current buildings were built in the following period. The town grew and new neighborhoods were built, as well as new apartment buildings and villas in existing neighborhoods. The area is currently known as ''Lombolo'' was built in the 1960s.<ref name=\"kiruna100early\" />\n\nAfter World War II, the economy of Kiruna started to diversify. Initially, the mechanisation of the mining industry led to more mechanical workshops developing machinery for the mine, still dependent on the mining, but individual companies with spinoffs that could be sold to other areas than the Kiruna mine alone. In the 1950s, a fund, ''Norrlandsfonden'' was established, in which profits from LKAB would be invested in order to diversify the local economy. The municipality started to lend money to starting companies against very beneficial rates, a scheme that lasted until 1959 because the banks, that insisted this was false competition, had established more relaxed rules for lending out money. The industrial area east of the city was built in the 1950s to separate industry from neighborhoods.<ref name=\"kiruna100aktillit\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Fr\u00e5n AK till IT|last=Nilsson|first=Kjell|date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |page=86&ndash;90 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 November 1960, [[Kiruna Airport]] opened to separate civilian air traffic from the military airplanes that had landed at Kalixfors airport and at [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] since World War I. A road to [[Nikkaluokta]] was opened in 1971 and to [[Riksgr\u00e4nsen]] and [[Narvik]] in 1984. The latter had been debated heavily, for alternative plans existed to build the road to Norway on the northern side of [[Tornetr\u00e4sk]], via Laimo, Kattuvuoma, [[Salmi (rural locality)|Salmi]] to Innset and [[Bardu]] in Norway. This road was never built, but a 25&nbsp;km long track between Laimo and Salmi was built at the initiatives of the locals and finished in 1962; however, this track, called Talmav\u00e4gen, is not connected to any other road.<ref name=\"kiruna100komm\" />\n\nIncreased communications were also beneficial for tourism. [[Swedish Railways]] had already run special trains before World War II, but started a special Dollar train in the summer months between [[Gothenburg]] and Kiruna, connecting to cruise ships from the [[United States]]. The canoe club Kiruna L\u00e5ngf\u00e4rdspaddlare was founded in 1972 and rafting for tourists restarted after it had been discontinued for 20 years due to the drowning of Valfrid Johansson. Until the 1980s, tourism had been mainly a summer business, but touristic exploitation of dog sledging was started in 1983 in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi. In 1990, the first [[Icehotel]] was built in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi and advertised as the world's largest igloo. It had been built using techniques from the building of [[Malmbanan]] 90 years before and was also inspired by the Snow Festival, that had started in 1986 to celebrate the Swedish [[Viking (satellite)|Viking]] satellite. Since 1998, a special tourist area exists in the mine and since 1999, tourists can visit the various areas of research going on in Kiruna.<ref name=\"kiruna100turism\" />\n\nIn 1957, the ''Kiruna Geophysical Observatory'' (KGO) (now the [[Swedish Institute of Space Physics]]) was founded and established by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. [[Esrange]] Space Centre is established in 1966. Here, rocket operations and ground-based observations are carried out since 1966, balloon operations since 1974, satellite operations since 1978 and testing operations since 2000 (with the [[Swedish Defence Material Administration]]). ESA has operated a satellite station at Salmaj\u00e4rvi, near Esrange, since 1989. In 1987, [[Ume\u00e5 University]] started a space engineering program in Kiruna, and [[GIS]] education was started by [[Lule\u00e5 University of Technology]] in 1991. In 1993, The Ume\u00e5 space engineers moved to the same building housing IRF and a year later another Lule\u00e5 University programme, civil engineering with specialisation in space technology, started at the same location. Since 2006, the ''Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Space Science and Technology'' has started with at least one semester spent at LTU. In 2007, education along IRV was split and only the Department of Space Science, belonging to Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, remained, while the Ume\u00e5 University programme in Space Engineering quit.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"irf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irf.se/Overview/?dbfile=About_Kiruna&dbsec=Administration&chosen=overview|title=Overview \u2013 Swedish Institute of Space Physics|accessdate=2009-02-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220183342/http://www.irf.se/Overview/?dbfile=About_Kiruna&dbsec=Administration&chosen=overview|archivedate=2008-12-20}}</ref><ref name=\"esrange\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.se/?id=5998|title=Esrange space centre \u2013 history|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref><ref name=\"kiruna100rymd\">{{cite book |title=Kiruna 100-\u00e5rsboken |chapter=N\u00e4ringsliv och forskning \u2013 Rymd, milj\u00f6 och gruva|last=Theander|first=Agge|date=27 April 2000|publisher=[[Kiruna municipality|Kiruna kommun]] |location=Kiruna |isbn=91-630-9371-5 |page=116&ndash;129 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Icehotel-se-04.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|ice hotel in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]]]]\n\nThe Kiruna [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|Icehotel]] has been built in [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]] each winter since 1990 and is a major tourist attraction.<ref name=\"icehotel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icehotel.com/|title=ICEHOTEL|accessdate=2009-02-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Moving the town ===\nThe re-development of Kiruna is a reconstruction project, as the Kirunavaara mine, run by [[LKAB]], undermines the current town center.

The city centre is built on the Haukavaara hill at an altitude of 530 m, high above the [[Torne river]] to the north and the [[Kalix river]] to the south. Other parts of the town are Lombolo and Tuolluvaara. Near Kiruna are the mountains [[Kiirunavaara]] and [[Luossavaara]]. Kiirunavaara is an iron ore mine that is the town's primary economic resource. Luossavaara is a former mine and now used as a skiing slope.\n\nThe city is built near the lake [[Luossaj\u00e4rvi]] with outflow to the Luossajoki that flows in the [[Torne river]] at Laxforsen. The area around Kiruna is very sparsely populated. The northwest, west and southwest of Kiruna are dominated by the [[Scandinavian mountains]], visible from the city centre. Sweden's highest mountain, [[Kebnekaise]], is {{convert|75|km|mi}} from the city centre and can be seen from it as well. To the west is [[Nikkaluokta]] and to the northwest are [[Abisko]], Bj\u00f6rkliden, [[Riksgr\u00e4nsen]] and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] town of [[Narvik]], {{convert|180|km}} via the road. {{convert|12|km|mi|0}} north of Kiruna is [[Kurravaara]], on the edge of the [[Torne River]]. The land north of Kurravaara is roadless, uninhabited, partly barren and partly birch forest, up to the Norwegian and [[Finland|Finnish]] borders at [[Treriksr\u00f6set]]. The lower-lying east is dominated by boreal forest, stretching hundreds (if not thousands) of kilometers into Finland and [[Russia]]. Around 15&nbsp;km east of Kiruna is a group of villages at the Torne River, most notably [[Jukkasj\u00e4rvi]], where an [[Icehotel (Jukkasj\u00e4rvi)|ice hotel]] is built in winter, attracting tourists from all over the world. The twin cities [[G\u00e4llivare]] and [[Malmberget]] are some 120&nbsp;km south of Kiruna.\n\nKiruna became a [[Stad (Sweden)|Swedish city]] on January 1, 1948, and was at one time listed as the largest city in the world by area,<ref>{{Cite web| title=Historien om v\u00e4rldens st\u00f6rsta stad| url=http://www.nsd.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleID=3597686| language=Swedish| publisher=[[Norrl\u00e4ndska Socialdemokraten]]| accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> even if most of its territory was non-urban. After the Swedish [[municipalities of Sweden|municipality reform]] in the 1970s, the term \"city\" has been legally discontinued. Today only the built-up area is considered a ''[[de facto]]'' city.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeing located 145&nbsp;km (90 miles) north of the [[Arctic Circle]], Kiruna has a [[subarctic climate|subarctic]]  (''Dfc'') climate with short, cool summers and long, cold winters, although the city itself can be considerably milder than the surrounding forest. Snow cover generally lasts from late September to mid-May, but snowfall can occur year-round. The [[midnight sun|sun does not set]] between 28 May and 16 July (50 days), and white nights lasts from early May to early August. [[polar night|The period that the sun does not rise]] lasts from 11 December to 1 January (22 days), the exact boundaries depending on local topography. Even though Kiruna's winters are very cold by Swedish standards, they are still much less severe than winters on similar latitudes in [[North America]] and [[Siberia]], and even more southerly areas in other parts of the world due to some maritime influence. Similar winter temperatures go as far south as below the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] in the [[Russian Far East]]. Kiruna however, has cooler summers than such areas, but still warm enough to stay above polar climate and below the northern [[tree line]]. Winter temperatures however are significantly colder than areas immediately affected by the [[Gulf Stream]] such, where in fact the regular lows of Kiruna during January and February are colder than or similar to [[Troms\u00f8]]'s [[Troms\u00f8#Climate|all-time record low]].\n\nThe coldest confirmed temperature ever in Kiruna was recorded at the nearby weather station with {{convert|-43.3|C|F}} recorded in January 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?91867|title=Temperature and Wind for January 2015 - All Time Records section|publisher=Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|accessdate=20 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016183657/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?91867|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The weather station recorded {{convert|31.6|C|F}} in July 1945, which is the all-time record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul14.pdf?715|title=Temperature and Wind for July 2014 - All Time Records section|publisher=Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|accessdate=20 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016183657/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul14.pdf?715|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The warmest month on record at the weather station was July 2018, with average high temperatures of {{convert|24.3|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul18.pdf?66120|title=July 2018 Temperature & Wind|language=sv|publisher=SMHI|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref> Kiruna has a gloomy climate, affected by Atlantic low-pressure systems.

The [[Malmbanan|railway]] connects Lule\u00e5 with G\u00e4llivare, Kiruna and Narvik. Although built to serve the mine, [[SJ AB|Swedish Rail]] runs daily passenger traffic on the line: a night train from Narvik to [[Stockholm]], a day train from Narvik to Lule\u00e5 (connecting with a second night train to Stockholm and [[Gothenburg]]), and trains to Lule\u00e5 and Narvik that start and finish in Kiruna. The latter is known as ''Karven'' and popular for day trips to the mountains near Abisko, Bj\u00f6rkliden and [[Riksgr\u00e4nsen]], particularly in winter. Additional long-distance trains are run by [[Transdev]] in summer.\nIn 2013, the railway station was moved 2&nbsp;km away from the city centre, so walking is possible but not recommended. There is a free shuttlebus for every departure and arrival which starts from Kiruna bustation in the city centre.\n\n[[Kiruna Airport]] is southeast of the city, 8&nbsp;km by road. A few daily flights connect Kiruna with Stockholm, either directly or via Lule\u00e5 or [[Ume\u00e5]].

In 1917, the name of the company was officially changed to Submarine Boat Corporation.<ref name=\"history1\"/> In 1933 Electric Boat acquired ownership of a shipyard in [[Groton, Connecticut]] to build submarines. The first submarine built in Groton to be delivered to the U.S. Navy was the [[USS Cuttlefish (SS-171)|USS ''Cuttlefish'']] in 1934.\n\nElectric Boat was cash-flush but lacking in work following [[World War II]], during which it produced 80 submarines for the Navy, with its workforce shrinking from 13,000 to 4,000 by 1946.<ref name=\"history1\"/> President and chief executive officer [[John Jay Hopkins]] started looking for companies that would fit into Electric Boat's market in hopes of diversifying.<ref name=\"history1\"/>\n\n===Canadair purchase===\n[[Canadair]] was owned by the Canadian government and was suffering from the same post-war malaise as Electric Boat. It was up for sale, and Hopkins bought the company for $10 million in 1946. The factory alone was worth more than $22 million, according to the Canadian government's calculations,<ref name=\"history1\"/> excluding the value of the remaining contracts for planes or spare parts. However, Canadair's production line and inventory systems were in disorder when Electric Boat purchased the company. Hopkins hired Canadian-born mass-production specialist H. Oliver West to take over the president's role and return Canadair to profitability. Shortly after the takeover, Canadair began delivering its new [[Canadair North Star]] (a version of the [[Douglas DC-4]]) and was able to deliver aircraft to [[Trans-Canada Airlines]], [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]], and [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) well in advance of their contracted delivery times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/canadair50yearhistory/introduction|title=introduction - canadair50yearhistory|website=sites.google.com |access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref>\n\nDefense spending increased with the onset of the Cold War, and Canadair went on to win many Canadian military contracts for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and became a major aerospace company. These included [[Canadair CT-133 Silver Star]] trainer, the [[Canadair Argus]] long-range maritime reconnaissance and [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]], and the [[Canadair F-86]] ''Sabre''. Between 1950 and 1958, 1,815 Sabres were built.  Canadair also produced 200 [[CF-104 Starfighter]] supersonic fighter aircraft, a license-built version of the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|Lockheed F-104]].\n\nIn 1976, General Dynamics sold Canadair to the Canadian Government for $38 million.<ref name=\"CA sold back\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/29/archives/general-dynamics-to-sell-canadair-ottawa-says-it-will-acquire.html|title=GENERAL DYNAMICS TO SELL CANADAIR Ottawa Says It Will Acquire Aircraft\u2010Manufacturing Unit for $38 Million|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Trumbull|first=Robert|date=November 29, 1975 |access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> Canadair was acquired by [[Bombardier Inc.]] in 1986.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/19/business/company-news-canadair-to-be-sold-to-bombardier-inc.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Canadair to Be Sold To Bombardier Inc.|last=Salpukas|first=Agis|date=1986-08-19|work=The New York Times |access-date=2019-08-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===General Dynamics emerges===\nAircraft production became increasingly important at Canadair, and Hopkins argued that the name \"Electric Boat\" was no longer appropriate\u2014so Electric Boat was reorganized as General Dynamics on 24 April 1952.<ref name=\"centennial_GD\">{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/generaldynamics/Aero35.htm |title=General Dynamics Corporation |work=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |access-date=2008-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112045623/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/generaldynamics/Aero35.htm |archivedate=2008-11-12 }}</ref>\n\nGeneral Dynamics purchased [[Convair]] from the Atlas Group in March 1953.<ref name=\"centennial_GD\"/> The sale was approved by government oversight with the provision that GD would continue to operate out of [[Air Force Plant 4]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. This factory had been set up in order to spread out strategic aircraft production and rented to Convair during the war to produce [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers. \n\nGeneral Dynamics purchased Liquid Carbonic Corporation in September 1957 and controlled it as a wholly-owned subsidiary until being forced by a Federal antitrust ruling to spin it off to shareholders in January 1969.

Over the next decade, the company introduced the [[F-106 Delta Dart]] [[interceptor aircraft|Interceptor]], the [[B-58 Hustler]], and the [[Convair 880]] and [[Convair 990|990]] [[airliner]]s. Convair also introduced the [[Atlas missile]] platform, the first operational [[intercontinental ballistic missile]].\n\n===Management churn===\nHopkins fell seriously ill during 1957 and was eventually replaced by Frank Pace later that year.<ref name=\"centennial_GD\"/> Meanwhile, John Naish succeeded Joseph McNarney as president of Convair. Chicago industrialist [[Henry Crown]] became the company's largest shareholder and merged his [[Material Service Corporation]] with GD in 1959.<ref name=\"henrycrown\">{{Cite book |first=Stewart |last=Alsop |title=America's Big New Rich |date=July 17, 1965 |publisher=The Saturday Evening Post}}</ref>\n\nGD subsequently reorganized into Eastern Group in [[New York City]] and Western Group in [[San Diego]], [[California]], with the latter taking over all of the aerospace activities and dropping the Convair brand name from its aircraft in the process.<ref name=\"history2\">{{cite book |author=Donald M.

The company recovered, then fell back into the same struggles.  In 1970, the board brought in [[McDonnell Douglas]] president [[David S. Lewis, Jr.|Dave Lewis]] (no relation) as chairman and CEO, who served until retiring in 1985.<ref name=\"history1\"/>\n\n===Aviation powerhouse===\nDuring the early 1960s the company bid on the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[TFX Program|Tactical Fighter, Experimental]] (TFX) project for a new low-level \"penetrator\". [[Robert McNamara]], newly installed as the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], forced a merger of the TFX with [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] plans for a new long-range \"fleet defender\" aircraft. In order to bid on a naval version successfully, GD partnered with [[Grumman]], which would build a customized version for [[aircraft carrier]] duties. After four rounds of bids and changes, the GD/Grumman team finally won the contract over a [[Boeing]] submission.\n\nThe [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]] that resulted first flew in December 1964. The F-111B flew in May 1965, but the navy said that it was too heavy for use on aircraft carriers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_sep2018-cancelled-f111b-1-180969916/|title=Was the Navy\u2019s F-111 Really That Bad?|publisher=[[Air&Space Magazine]]|author=Robert Bernier |access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> With an unacceptable navy version, estimates for 2,400 F-111s, including exports, were sharply reduced, but GD still managed to make a $300-million profit on the project.<ref name=\"history2\"/> Grumman went on to use many of the innovations of the F-111 in the highly successful [[F-14 Tomcat]],<ref name=\"history1\"/> an aircraft designed solely as a carrier-borne fighter.\n\n===Reorganization===\nIn May 1965, GD reorganized into 12 operating divisions based on product lines. The board decided to build all future planes in Fort Worth, ending plane production at Convair's original plant in San Diego but continuing with space and missile development there. In October 1970, Roger Lewis left and David S. Lewis from [[McDonnell Douglas]] was named CEO. Lewis required that the company headquarters move to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], which occurred in February 1971.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/boeing-moving-defense-hq-from-st-louis-to-d-c/article_029c405c-5f9b-5445-9008-3f8084708306.html|title=Boeing moving defense HQ from St. Louis to D.C. area|last=Brown|first=Lisa|work=stltoday.com |access-date=2017-04-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===F-16 success===\nIn 1972, GD bid on the USAF's [[Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF) project. GD and [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] were awarded prototype contracts. GD's F-111 program was winding down, and the company desperately needed a new aircraft contract. It organized its own version of [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]'s famed \"[[Skunk Works]]\", the Advanced Concepts Laboratory, and responded with a new aircraft design incorporating advanced technologies.\n\nGD's [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|YF-16]] first flew in January 1974 and proved to have slightly better performance than the [[Northrop YF-17|YF-17]] in head-to-head testing. It entered production as the F-16 in January 1975 with an initial order of 650 and a total order of 1,388. The F-16 also won contracts worldwide, beating the F-17 in foreign competition as well. GD built an aircraft production factory in Fort Worth, Texas.  F-16 orders eventually totaled more than 4,000, making it the largest and most successful program for the company, and one of the most successful western military projects since World War II.\n[[File:Gulfstream G650 departs Bristol 23rdAug2014 arp.jpg|thumb|In 1999 the company acquired Gulfstream Aerospace. Here, a [[Gulfstream G650]] departs [[Bristol International Airport|Bristol Airport]], [[England]] in 2014.]]\n\n===Land Systems and Marine Systems focus===\n{{main|General Dynamics Land Systems}}\nIn 1976, General Dynamics sold the struggling Canadair back to the Canadian government for $38 million. By 1984, General Dynamics had four divisions: Convair in San Diego, General Dynamics-Fort Worth, General Dynamics-Pomona, and General Dynamics-Electronics. In 1985 a further reorganization created the Space Systems Division from the Convair Space division. In 1985, GD also acquired [[Cessna]].  In 1986 the Pomona division (which mainly produced the Standard Missile and the Phalanx CIWS for the navy) was split up,  creating the Valley Systems Division.  Valley Systems produced the Stinger surface-to-air missile and the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM).  Both units were recombined into one entity in 1992.\n\nHenry Crown, still GD's largest shareholder, died on 15 August 1990. Following this, the company started to rapidly divest its under-performing divisions under CEO [[William Anders]]. Cessna was re-sold to [[Textron]] in January 1992, the San Diego and Pomona missile production units to [[General Motors]]-[[Hughes Aerospace]] in May 1992, the Fort Worth aircraft production to [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in March 1993 (a nearby electronics production facility was separately sold to Israeli-based [[Elbit Systems]], marking that company's entry into the United States market), and its Space Systems Division to [[Martin Marietta]] in 1994. The remaining Convair Aircraft Structure unit was sold to McDonnell Douglas in 1994. The remains of the Convair Division were simply closed in 1996. GD's exit from the aviation world was short-lived, and in 1999 the company acquired [[Gulfstream Aerospace]].  The Pomona operation was closed shortly after its sale to Hughes Aircraft.\n\nIn 1995, General Dynamics purchased the privately held [[Bath Iron Works]] shipyard in [[Bath, Maine]], for $300 million, diversifying its shipbuilding portfolio to include U.S. Navy surface ships such as [[Guided missile destroyer|guided-missile destroyers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-08-18-fi-36555-story.html|title=General Dynamics to Buy Bath Iron Works Shipyard : Defense: The purchase would give the contractor access to $2 billion in orders for Navy ships.|date=1995-08-18|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US |access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> In 1998, the company acquired NASSCO, formerly [[National Steel and Shipbuilding Company]], for $415 million. The San Diego shipyard produces U.S. Navy auxiliary and support ships as well as commercial ships that are eligible to be U.S.-flagged under the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-oct-09-fi-30651-story.html|title=Defense Giant to Purchase Nassco for $415 Million|date=1998-10-09|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US |access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref>\n\nHaving divested itself of its aviation holdings, GD concentrated on land and sea products. GD purchased [[Chrysler]]'s defense divisions in 1982, renaming them General Dynamics Land Systems. In 2003, it purchased the defense divisions of [[General Motors]] as well. It is now a major supplier of armored vehicles of all types, including the [[M1 Abrams]], [[LAV 25]], [[Stryker]], and a wide variety of vehicles based on these chassis.  [[Force Protection Inc|Force Protection, Inc.]] was acquired by General Dynamics Land Systems in November 2011 for $350 million.\n\n===Recent history===\nOn August 19, 2008, GD agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the US Government claiming that a GD unit fraudulently billed the government for defectively manufactured parts used in US military aircraft and submarines.  The US alleged that GD defectively manufactured or failed to test parts used in US military aircraft from September 2001 to August 2003, such as for the [[C-141 Starlifter]] transport plane. The GD unit involved, based in [[Glen Cove, New York]], closed in 2004.<ref>''[[Washington Post]]'', \"General Dynamics To Settle Suit For $4 Million\", August 19, 2008, p. D4.</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the government of Canada announced it had selected the General Dynamics Land Systems subsidiary in [[London, Ontario]], to produce [[LAV-25|Light Armoured Vehicles]] for [[Saudi

In 1917, the name of the company was officially changed to Submarine Boat Corporation.<ref name=\"history1\"/> In 1933 Electric Boat acquired ownership of a shipyard in [[Groton, Connecticut]] to build submarines. The first submarine built in Groton to be delivered to the U.S. Navy was the [[USS Cuttlefish (SS-171)|USS ''Cuttlefish'']] in 1934.\n\nElectric Boat was cash-flush but lacking in work following [[World War II]], during which it produced 80 submarines for the Navy, with its workforce shrinking from 13,000 to 4,000 by 1946.<ref name=\"history1\"/> President and chief executive officer [[John Jay Hopkins]] started looking for companies that would fit into Electric Boat's market in hopes of diversifying.<ref name=\"history1\"/>\n\n===Canadair purchase===\n[[Canadair]] was owned by the Canadian government and was suffering from the same post-war malaise as Electric Boat. It was up for sale, and Hopkins bought the company for $10 million in 1946. The factory alone was worth more than $22 million, according to the Canadian government's calculations,<ref name=\"history1\"/> excluding the value of the remaining contracts for planes or spare parts. However, Canadair's production line and inventory systems were in disorder when Electric Boat purchased the company. Hopkins hired Canadian-born mass-production specialist H. Oliver West to take over the president's role and return Canadair to profitability. Shortly after the takeover, Canadair began delivering its new [[Canadair North Star]] (a version of the [[Douglas DC-4]]) and was able to deliver aircraft to [[Trans-Canada Airlines]], [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]], and [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) well in advance of their contracted delivery times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/canadair50yearhistory/introduction|title=introduction - canadair50yearhistory|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref>\n\nDefense spending increased with the onset of the Cold War, and Canadair went on to win many Canadian military contracts for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and became a major aerospace company. These included [[Canadair CT-133 Silver Star]] trainer, the [[Canadair Argus]] long-range maritime reconnaissance and [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]], and the [[Canadair F-86]] ''Sabre''. Between 1950 and 1958, 1,815 Sabres were built.  Canadair also produced 200 [[CF-104 Starfighter]] supersonic fighter aircraft, a license-built version of the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|Lockheed F-104]].\n\nIn 1976, General Dynamics sold Canadair to the Canadian Government for $38 million.<ref name=\"CA sold back\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/29/archives/general-dynamics-to-sell-canadair-ottawa-says-it-will-acquire.html|title=GENERAL DYNAMICS TO SELL CANADAIR Ottawa Says It Will Acquire Aircraft\u2010Manufacturing Unit for $38 Million|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Trumbull|first=Robert|date=November 29, 1975|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref> Canadair was acquired by [[Bombardier Inc.]] in 1986.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/19/business/company-news-canadair-to-be-sold-to-bombardier-inc.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Canadair to Be Sold To Bombardier Inc.|last=Salpukas|first=Agis|date=1986-08-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===General Dynamics emerges===\nAircraft production became increasingly important at Canadair, and Hopkins argued that the name \"Electric Boat\" was no longer appropriate\u2014so Electric Boat was reorganized as General Dynamics on 24 April 1952.<ref name=\"centennial_GD\">{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/generaldynamics/Aero35.htm |title=General Dynamics Corporation |work=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |accessdate=2008-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112045623/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/generaldynamics/Aero35.htm |archivedate=2008-11-12 }}</ref>\n\nGeneral Dynamics purchased [[Convair]] from the Atlas Group in March 1953.<ref name=\"centennial_GD\"/> The sale was approved by government oversight with the provision that GD would continue to operate out of [[Air Force Plant 4]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].

The company recovered, then fell back into the same struggles.  In 1970, the board brought in [[McDonnell Douglas]] president [[David S. Lewis, Jr.|Dave Lewis]] (no relation) as chairman and CEO, who served until retiring in 1985.<ref name=\"history1\"/>\n\n===Aviation powerhouse===\nDuring the early 1960s the company bid on the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[TFX Program|Tactical Fighter, Experimental]] (TFX) project for a new low-level \"penetrator\". [[Robert McNamara]], newly installed as the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], forced a merger of the TFX with [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] plans for a new long-range \"fleet defender\" aircraft. In order to bid on a naval version successfully, GD partnered with [[Grumman]], which would build a customized version for [[aircraft carrier]] duties. After four rounds of bids and changes, the GD/Grumman team finally won the contract over a [[Boeing]] submission.\n\nThe [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]] that resulted first flew in December 1964. The F-111B flew in May 1965, but the navy said that it was too heavy for use on aircraft carriers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_sep2018-cancelled-f111b-1-180969916/|title=Was the Navy\u2019s F-111 Really That Bad?|publisher=[[Air&Space Magazine]]|author=Robert Bernier|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref> With an unacceptable navy version, estimates for 2,400 F-111s, including exports, were sharply reduced, but GD still managed to make a $300-million profit on the project.<ref name=\"history2\"/> Grumman went on to use many of the innovations of the F-111 in the highly successful [[F-14 Tomcat]],<ref name=\"history1\"/> an aircraft designed solely as a carrier-borne fighter.\n\n===Reorganization===\nIn May 1965, GD reorganized into 12 operating divisions based on product lines. The board decided to build all future planes in Fort Worth, ending plane production at Convair's original plant in San Diego but continuing with space and missile development there. In October 1970, Roger Lewis left and David S. Lewis from [[McDonnell Douglas]] was named CEO. Lewis required that the company headquarters move to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], which occurred in February 1971.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/boeing-moving-defense-hq-from-st-louis-to-d-c/article_029c405c-5f9b-5445-9008-3f8084708306.html|title=Boeing moving defense HQ from St. Louis to D.C. area|last=Brown|first=Lisa|work=stltoday.com|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===F-16 success===\nIn 1972, GD bid on the USAF's [[Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF) project. GD and [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] were awarded prototype contracts. GD's F-111 program was winding down, and the company desperately needed a new aircraft contract. It organized its own version of [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]'s famed \"[[Skunk Works]]\", the Advanced Concepts Laboratory, and responded with a new aircraft design incorporating advanced technologies.\n\nGD's [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|YF-16]] first flew in January 1974 and proved to have slightly better performance than the [[Northrop YF-17|YF-17]] in head-to-head testing. It entered production as the F-16 in January 1975 with an initial order of 650 and a total order of 1,388. The F-16 also won contracts worldwide, beating the F-17 in foreign competition as well. GD built an aircraft production factory in Fort Worth, Texas.  F-16 orders eventually totaled more than 4,000, making it the largest and most successful program for the company, and one of the most successful western military projects since World War II.\n[[File:Gulfstream G650 departs Bristol 23rdAug2014 arp.jpg|thumb|In 1999 the company acquired Gulfstream Aerospace. Here, a [[Gulfstream G650]] departs [[Bristol International Airport|Bristol Airport]], [[England]] in 2014.]]\n\n===Land Systems and Marine Systems focus===\n{{main|General Dynamics Land Systems}}\nIn 1976, General Dynamics sold the struggling Canadair back to the Canadian government for $38 million. By 1984, General Dynamics had four divisions: Convair in San Diego, General Dynamics-Fort Worth, General Dynamics-Pomona, and General Dynamics-Electronics. In 1985 a further reorganization created the Space Systems Division from the Convair Space division. In 1985, GD also acquired [[Cessna]].  In 1986 the Pomona division (which mainly produced the Standard Missile and the Phalanx CIWS for the navy) was split up,  creating the Valley Systems Division.  Valley Systems produced the Stinger surface-to-air missile and the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM).  Both units were recombined into one entity in 1992.\n\nHenry Crown, still GD's largest shareholder, died on 15 August 1990. Following this, the company started to rapidly divest its under-performing divisions under CEO [[William Anders]]. Cessna was re-sold to [[Textron]] in January 1992, the San Diego and Pomona missile production units to [[General Motors]]-[[Hughes Aerospace]] in May 1992, the Fort Worth aircraft production to [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in March 1993 (a nearby electronics production facility was separately sold to Israeli-based [[Elbit Systems]], marking that company's entry into the United States market), and its Space Systems Division to [[Martin Marietta]] in 1994. The remaining Convair Aircraft Structure unit was sold to McDonnell Douglas in 1994. The remains of the Convair Division were simply closed in 1996. GD's exit from the aviation world was short-lived, and in 1999 the company acquired [[Gulfstream Aerospace]].  The Pomona operation was closed shortly after its sale to Hughes Aircraft.\n\nIn 1995, General Dynamics purchased the privately held [[Bath Iron Works]] shipyard in [[Bath, Maine]], for $300 million, diversifying its shipbuilding portfolio to include U.S. Navy surface ships such as [[Guided missile destroyer|guided-missile destroyers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-08-18-fi-36555-story.html|title=General Dynamics to Buy Bath Iron Works Shipyard : Defense: The purchase would give the contractor access to $2 billion in orders for Navy ships.|date=1995-08-18|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> In 1998, the company acquired NASSCO, formerly [[National Steel and Shipbuilding Company]], for $415 million.

GD purchased [[Chrysler]]'s defense divisions in 1982, renaming them General Dynamics Land Systems. In 2003, it purchased the defense divisions of [[General Motors]] as well. It is now a major supplier of armored vehicles of all types, including the [[M1 Abrams]], [[LAV 25]], [[Stryker]], and a wide variety of vehicles based on these chassis.  [[Force Protection Inc|Force Protection, Inc.]] was acquired by General Dynamics Land Systems in November 2011 for $350 million.\n\n===Recent history===\nOn August 19, 2008, GD agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the US Government claiming that a GD unit fraudulently billed the government for defectively manufactured parts used in US military aircraft and submarines.  The US alleged that GD defectively manufactured or failed to test parts used in US military aircraft from September 2001 to August 2003, such as for the [[C-141 Starlifter]] transport plane. The GD unit involved, based in [[Glen Cove, New York]], closed in 2004.<ref>''[[Washington Post]]'', \"General Dynamics To Settle Suit For $4 Million\", August 19, 2008, p.

[[Wuhan]], the capital of [[Hubei]] province, China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite
