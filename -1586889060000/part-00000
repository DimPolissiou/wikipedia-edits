His mother was then married to statesman Vasily Lunacharsky, whence Anatoly's surname and patronym. She later divorced Vasily Lunacharsky and married Antonov, but Anatoly kept his former name.<ref name=Russiapedia /><ref name=Britannica /> In 1890, at the age of 15, Lunacharsky became a Marxist. From 1894, he studied at the [[University of Zurich]] under [[Richard Avenarius]] for two years without taking a degree. In [[Z\u00fcrich]], he met European socialists including [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Leo Jogiches]] and joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1896, Luncharsky returned to Russia, where he was arrested and sent to [[Kaluga]] in [[Siberia]] through 1901\u20131902, when he returned to [[Kiev]]. In February 1902, he moved in with [[Alexander Bogdanov]], who was working in a [[mental hospital]] in [[Vologda]], Russia.<ref name=EncyclMarx /><ref name=Russiapedia />\n\n=== Vpered ===\n\nIn 1903, the party split into [[Bolsheviks]] led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Mensheviks]] led by [[Julius Martov]] and Lunacharsky sided with the former. In 1907, he attended the [[International Socialist Congress, Stuttgart 1907|International Socialist Congress]], held in [[Stuttgart]]. When the Bolsheviks in turn split into Lenin's supporters and [[Alexander Bogdanov]]'s followers in 1908, Lunacharsky supported his brother-in-law Bogdanov in setting up ''[[Vpered]]''. Like many contemporary socialists (including Bogdanov), Lunacharsky was influenced by the empirio-criticism philosophy of [[Ernst Mach]] and Avenarius. Lenin opposed Machism as a form of subjective idealism and strongly criticised its proponents in his book ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]]'' (1908). In 1909, Lunacharsky joined Bogdanov and Gorky at the latter's villa on the island of [[Capri]], where they started a school for Russian socialist workers. In 1910, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]] and their supporters moved the school to [[Bologna]], where they continued teaching classes through 1911. In 1913, Lunacharsky moved to Paris, where he started his own Circle of Proletarian Culture.<ref name=Russiapedia /><ref name=Britannica />\n\n===World War I===\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Lunacharsky adopted an [[Internationalist/Defencist Schism|internationalist]] antiwar position which put him on a course of convergence with Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]]. In 1915, Lunacharsky and [[Pavel Lebedev-Poliansky]] restarted the social democratic newspaper ''Vpered'' with an emphasis on [[proletarian culture]].<ref name=\"paris\">Bernice Glatzer Rosenthal, ''New Myth, New World: From Nietzsche to Stalinism'', Pennsylvania State University, 2002, p.85 {{ISBN|0-271-02533-6}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Lunacharsky left his family in Switzerland and returned to Russia. Like other internationalist social democrats returning from abroad, he briefly joined the [[Mezhraiontsy]] before they merged with the Bolsheviks in July\u2013August 1917.  In July 1917, the Kerensky government jailed him.<ref name=EncyclMarx /><ref name=Russiapedia /><ref name=Britannica />\n\n===People's Commissariat for Education (Narkompros)===\nAfter the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Lunacharsky was appointed as [[People's Commissariat for Education]] (Narkompros) in the first Soviet government and remained in that position until 1929.<ref name=Russiapedia /><ref name=Britannica /> In 1921, ''The New York Times'' reported his resignation.<ref>\n{{Cite news \n|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/01/05/issue.html \n|title=The New York Times\n|date = 5 January 1921 \n|access-date = 14 March 2017\n}}</ref> \n[[File:Anatoly Lunacharsky 1927.jpg|left|thumb|Lunacharsky, People's Commissar for Education on 13 Congress of Soviets of the RSFSR, April 1927]]\nLunacharsky was associated with the establishment of the [[Tovstonogov Theater|Bolshoi Drama Theater]] in 1919, working with [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Alexander Blok]] and [[Maria Fyodorovna Andreyeva|Maria Andreyeva]]. He was also in charge of the Soviet state's first [[censorship]] system. Lunacharsky helped his former colleague Alexander Bogdanov start a semi-independent proletarian art movement called [[Proletkult]]. Lunacharsky also oversaw improvements in Russia's literacy rate.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} By arguing for their architectural Importance, he argued for the protection of historic buildings against elements in the [[Bolshevik Party]] who wanted to destroy them.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nLunacharsky directed some of the great experiments in public arts after the Revolution such as the [[agit-train]]s and agit-boats that circulated over all Russia spreading Revolution and revolutionary arts. He also gave support to [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]]'s theatrical experiments and the initiatives such as the [[ROSTA Windows]], revolutionary posters designed and written by Mayakovsky, Rodchenko and others.\n\nWhile commissar, Lunacharsky's initiatives included the establishment of [[Isadora Duncan]]'s school in Moscow, but he was also a playwright, critic, essayist and a widely admired man of culture. As the first Commissar of Enlightenment after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, he was credited with preserving much of Russia's cultural heritage.<ref name=NewMinister />\n\nIn June 1919, ''The New York Times'' decried Lunacharsky's efforts in education in an article entitle \"Reds Are Ruining Children of Russia\". It claimed that he was instilling a \"system of calculated moral depravity [...] in one of the most diabolical of all measures conceived by the Bolshevik rulers of Russia\".<ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Reds Are Ruining Children of Russia: Lunacharsky's System of Calculated Moral Depravity Described by Swiss Teacher: Aims to Destroy the Home\n| work = New York Times\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1919/06/13/archives/reds-are-ruining-children-of-russia-lunacharskys-system-of.html\n| date = 13 June 1919\n| accessdate = 6 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929, Lunacharsky supported a change in the Soviet Union from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet.<ref name=Russiapedia /><ref name=Britannica />\n\n===Later career===\n\nIn 1929 Lunacharsky was appointed to the Learned Council of the Soviet Union Central Executive Committee.

During the [[Great Purge]] of 1936-1938, Lunacharsky's name was erased from the Communist Party's history and his memoirs were banned.<ref>[[Roy Medvedev]], ''Let History Judge'', 1971.</ref> A revival came in the late 1950s and 1960s, with a surge of memoirs about Lunacharsky and many streets and organizations named or renamed in his honor. During that era, Lunacharsky was viewed by the Soviet [[intelligentsia]] as an educated, refined and tolerant Soviet politician.\n\nIn the 1960s, his daughter Irina Lunacharsky helped revive his popularity.  Several streets and institutions were named in his honor.<ref name=Russiapedia />\n\nIn 1971, Asteroid 2446 was named after Lunacharsky.<ref name=Russiapedia />\n\nSome Soviet-built orchestral [[harp]]s also bear the name of Lunacharsky, presumably in his honor.

He wrote literary essays on the works of several writers, including [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Marcel Proust]]. However, his most notable work is his memoirs, ''Revolutionary Silhouettes'', which describe anecdotes and Lunacharsky's general impressions of Lenin, Trotsky and eight other revolutionaries. Trotsky reacted to some of Lunacharsky's opinions in his own autobiography, ''My Life.''\n\nIn the 1920s, Lunacharsky produced [[Lyubov Popova]]'s ''The Locksmith and the Chancellor'' at the Comedy Theater.<ref>\n{{cite news\n| first = Michael\n| last = Kimmelmann\n| title = When Soviet Art Tried to Remake The World\n| work = New York Times\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/24/arts/art-when-soviet-art-tried-to-remake-the-world.html\n| date = 24 February 1991\n| accessdate = 6 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome of his works include:\n* ''Outlines of a Collective Philosophy'' (1909)<ref name=Britannica />\n* ''Self-Education of the Workers: The Cultural Task of the Struggling Proletariat'' (1918)<ref>\n{{cite book\n| first = Anatoly\n| last = Lunacharsky\n| authorlink = Anatoly Lunacharsky\n| title = Self-Education of the Workers: The Cultural Task of the Struggling Proletariat\n| publisher = The Workers\u2019 Socialist Federation\n| place = London\n| url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/lunachar/1918/self-education.htm\n| date = 1923\n| accessdate = 6 January 2018}}</ref>\n* ''Three Plays'' (1923)<ref name=Britannica />\n* ''Revolutionary Silhouettes'' (1923)<ref>\n{{cite book\n| first = Anatoly\n| last = Lunacharsky\n| authorlink = Anatoly Lunacharsky\n| title = Revolutionary Silhouettes\n| publisher = \n| url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/lunachar/works/silhouet/index.htm\n| date = 1923\n| accessdate = 6 January 2018}}</ref>\n* ''Theses on the Problems of Marxist Criticism'' (1928)<ref>\n{{cite book\n| first = A.

part of the [[Russian Empire]]) as the [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] child of Alexander Antonov and Alexandra Lunacharskaya, n\u00e9e Rostovtseva. His mother was then married to statesman Vasily Lunacharsky, whence Anatoly's surname and patronym. She later divorced Vasily Lunacharsky and married Antonov, but Anatoly kept his former name.<ref name=Russiapedia /><ref name=Britannica /> In 1890, at the age of 15, Lunacharsky became a Marxist. From 1894, he studied at the [[University of Zurich]] under [[Richard Avenarius]] for two years without taking a degree. In [[Z\u00fcrich]], he met European socialists including [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Leo Jogiches]] and joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1896, Luncharsky returned to Russia, where he was arrested and sent to [[Kaluga]] in [[Siberia]] through 1901\u20131902, when he returned to [[Kiev]]. In February 1902, he moved in with [[Alexander Bogdanov]], who was working in a [[mental hospital]] in [[Vologda]], Russia.<ref name=EncyclMarx /><ref name=Russiapedia />\n\n=== Vpered ===\n\nIn 1903, the party split into [[Bolsheviks]] led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Mensheviks]] led by [[Julius Martov]] and Lunacharsky sided with the former. In 1907, he attended the [[International Socialist Congress, Stuttgart 1907|International Socialist Congress]], held in [[Stuttgart]]. When the Bolsheviks in turn split into Lenin's supporters and [[Alexander Bogdanov]]'s followers in 1908, Lunacharsky supported his brother-in-law Bogdanov in setting up ''[[Vpered]]''. Like many contemporary socialists (including Bogdanov), Lunacharsky was influenced by the empirio-criticism philosophy of [[Ernst Mach]] and Avenarius. Lenin opposed Machism as a form of subjective idealism and strongly criticised its proponents in his book ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]]'' (1908). In 1909, Lunacharsky joined Bogdanov and Gorky at the latter's villa on the island of [[Capri]], where they started a school for Russian socialist workers. In 1910, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]] and their supporters moved the school to [[Bologna]], where they continued teaching classes through 1911. In 1913, Lunacharsky moved to Paris, where he started his own Circle of Proletarian Culture.<ref name=Russiapedia /><ref name=Britannica />\n\n===World War I===\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Lunacharsky adopted an [[Internationalist/Defencist Schism|internationalist]] antiwar position which put him on a course of convergence with Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]]. In 1915, Lunacharsky and [[Pavel Lebedev-Poliansky]] restarted the social democratic newspaper ''Vpered'' with an emphasis on [[proletarian culture]].<ref name=\"paris\">Bernice Glatzer Rosenthal, ''New Myth, New World: From Nietzsche to Stalinism'', Pennsylvania State University, 2002, p.85 {{ISBN|0-271-02533-6}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Lunacharsky left his family in Switzerland and returned to Russia. Like other internationalist social democrats returning from abroad, he briefly joined the [[Mezhraiontsy]] before they merged with the Bolsheviks in July\u2013August 1917.  In July 1917, the Kerensky government jailed him.<ref name=EncyclMarx /><ref name=Russiapedia /><ref name=Britannica />\n\n===People's Commissariat for Education (Narkompros)===\nAfter the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Lunacharsky was appointed as [[People's Commissariat for Education]] (Narkompros) in the first Soviet government and remained in that position until 1929.<ref name=Russiapedia /><ref name=Britannica /> In 1921, ''The New York Times'' reported his resignation.<ref>\n{{Cite news \n|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/01/05/issue.html \n|title=The New York Times\n|date = 5 January 1921 \n|access-date = 14 March 2017\n}}</ref> \n[[File:Anatoly Lunacharsky 1927.jpg|left|thumb|Lunacharsky, People's Commissar for Education on 13 Congress of Soviets of the RSFSR, April 1927]]\nLunacharsky was associated with the establishment of the [[Tovstonogov Theater|Bolshoi Drama Theater]] in 1919, working with [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Alexander Blok]] and [[Maria Fyodorovna Andreyeva|Maria Andreyeva]]. He was also in charge of the Soviet state's first [[censorship]] system. Lunacharsky helped his former colleague Alexander Bogdanov start a semi-independent proletarian art movement called [[Proletkult]]. Lunacharsky also oversaw improvements in Russia's literacy rate.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} By arguing for their architectural Importance, he argued for the protection of historic buildings against elements in the [[Bolshevik Party]] who wanted to destroy them.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nLunacharsky directed some of the great experiments in public arts after the Revolution such as the [[agit-train]]s and agit-boats that circulated over all Russia spreading Revolution and revolutionary arts. He also gave support to [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]]'s theatrical experiments and the initiatives such as the [[ROSTA Windows]], revolutionary posters designed and written by Mayakovsky, Rodchenko and others.\n\nWhile commissar, Lunacharsky's initiatives included the establishment of [[Isadora Duncan]]'s school in Moscow, but he was also a playwright, critic, essayist and a widely admired man of culture. As the first Commissar of Enlightenment after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, he was credited with preserving much of Russia's cultural heritage.<ref name=NewMinister />\n\nIn June 1919, ''The New York Times'' decried Lunacharsky's efforts in education in an article entitle \"Reds Are Ruining Children of Russia\". It claimed that he was instilling a \"system of calculated moral depravity [...] in one of the most diabolical of all measures conceived by the Bolshevik rulers of Russia\".<ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Reds Are Ruining Children of Russia: Lunacharsky's System of Calculated Moral Depravity Described by Swiss Teacher: Aims to Destroy the Home\n| work = New York Times\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/21/arts/dance/a-visionary-of-balletic-folk-dance-turns-100.html\n| date = 13 June 1919\n| accessdate = 6 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929, Lunacharsky supported a change in the Soviet Union from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet.<ref name=Russiapedia /><ref name=Britannica />\n\n===Later career===\n\nIn 1929 Lunacharsky was appointed to the Learned Council of the Soviet Union Central Executive Committee.

During that era, Lunacharsky was viewed by the Soviet [[intelligentsia]] as an educated, refined and tolerant Soviet politician.\n\nIn the 1960s, his daughter Irina Lunacharsky helped revive his popularity.  Several streets and institutions were named in his honor.<ref name=Russiapedia />\n\nIn 1971, Asteroid 2446 was named after Lunacharsky.<ref name=Russiapedia />\n\nSome Soviet-built orchestral [[harp]]s also bear the name of Lunacharsky, presumably in his honor.

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]] was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable for attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States, and the legislature first met there, at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp, and so a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856, but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the [[coin collecting]] hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact that the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and in 1935 President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that Congress pass no more such bills.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|title=Commemorative coins and Mint bills|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1947-bcs-0003|url-access=subscription|date=February 10, 1947|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe coin was proposed by Columbia Sesqui-Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name=ngc>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1936-d-columbia-50c-ms-coinid-19292|title=Silver Commemoratives \u2013 1936 D Columbia 50C MS|website=NGC Coin Explorer|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935 by South Carolina's [[Hampton P.

[[Bertrand H. Snell]] of New York asked if the bill had come from the Coinage Committee, and Fulmer stated that it had, and it was being pressed now in the hope of having coins to sell at the celebrations in Columbia in March. Snell stated that he had wanted such a coin at the request of some people from his part of the country, but had learned it was against Treasury Department policy. [[Jesse P. Wolcott]] of Michigan noted that he and others from that state had tried to get a coin for the centennial of its admission to the Union, and had not pressed the matter only because of Treasury Department opposition and the threat of a presidential veto. [[Thomas J. O'Brien (Illinois politician)|Thomas J.

South Carolina's [[James F.

The Senate amended the bill and passed it without discussion or dissent.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3100|date=March 3, 1936}}</ref> As the two houses had passed versions that were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March 5, Fulmer asked that the House adopt the Senate amendments, which it did.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3337|date=March 5, 1936}}</ref> The bill, providing for 25,000 half dollars, became law with the signature of President Roosevelt on March 18, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n==Preparation==\nThe Sesqui-Centennial Commission selected 32-year old sculptor Abraham Wolfe Davidson of [[Clemson University|Clemson College]] to design the coin.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early>{{cite web|url=http://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/|title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar|website=Early Commemorative Coins|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Davidson, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, had reached a deal with Clemson administrators whereby he would sculpt a statue of its founder, [[Thomas G. Clemson]], in exchange for room, board and tuition.{{sfn|Brothers}} His completed plaster models were sent to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]] (CFA) by the [[Director of the United States Mint]], [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], on May 25, 1936.{{sfn|Taxay|p=179}} The CFA was by a 1921 [[executive order]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] charged with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins,{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi}} and Ross wanted the CFA\"s opinion, though she recognized there were visible defects in Davidson's design.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} The CFA chair, [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts|Charles Moore]] agreed with Ross's assessment in a letter dated June 1, 1936, and suggested the South Carolina commission hire an experienced medallist.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} According to Eric Brothers in his article on Davidson for ''[[The Numismatist]]'': \"The Sesquicentennial Committee would not budge; Davidson was Columbia\u2019s and Clemson\u2019s talented, adopted son.\"{{sfn|Brothers}}\n\nOn June 13, Ross returned the models to Davidson and wrote to James Hammond, chair of the Sesqui-Centennial Commission, stating she had returned the models and setting forth the Mint's technical requirements for coinage models.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} Thereafter, Davidson worked under the supervision of  [[Lee Lawrie]], sculptor-member of the CFA. The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each.  If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014at the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a palmetto tree, the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, wrote, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March 22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May 30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He further requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March 11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nIn order to have a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were only available to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2. Dealers were not able to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} causing them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a [[time capsule]] that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nBy 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and $100 by 1965. By 1980, they were $1,750 per set, a price that decreased thereafter.{{sfn|Bowers|p=346}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S.

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The obverse design depicts the personification of justice holding a sword and scales and standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the New State House built (between 1855 and 1907), while the reverse shows the Palmetto tree, [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]] was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable for attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States, and the legislature first met there, at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp, and so a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856, but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the [[coin collecting]] hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact that the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and in 1935 President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that Congress pass no more such bills.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|title=Commemorative coins and Mint bills|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1947-bcs-0003|url-access=subscription|date=February 10, 1947|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe coin was proposed by Columbia Sesqui-Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name=ngc>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1936-d-columbia-50c-ms-coinid-19292|title=Silver Commemoratives \u2013 1936 D Columbia 50C MS|website=NGC Coin Explorer|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935 by South Carolina's [[Hampton P.

[[Bertrand H. Snell]] of New York asked if the bill had come from the Coinage Committee, and Fulmer stated that it had, and it was being pressed now in the hope of having coins to sell at the celebrations in Columbia in March. Snell stated that he had wanted such a coin at the request of some people from his part of the country, but had learned it was against Treasury Department policy. [[Jesse P. Wolcott]] of Michigan noted that he and others from that state had tried to get a coin for the centennial of its admission to the Union, and had not pressed the matter only because of Treasury Department opposition and the threat of a presidential veto. [[Thomas J. O'Brien (Illinois politician)|Thomas J.

South Carolina's [[James F. Byrnes]] reported it back on March 3, 1936 recommending a number of minor amendments which stressed that the anniversary commemorated was not the founding of the city, but of it being the capital of South Carolina. The Senate amended the bill and passed it without discussion or dissent.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3100|date=March 3, 1936}}</ref> As the two houses had passed versions that were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March 5, Fulmer asked that the House adopt the Senate amendments, which it did.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3337|date=March 5, 1936}}</ref> The bill, providing for 25,000 half dollars, became law with the signature of President Roosevelt on March 18, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n==Preparation==\nThe Sesqui-Centennial Commission selected 32-year old sculptor Abraham Wolfe Davidson of [[Clemson University|Clemson College]] to design the coin.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early>{{cite web|url=http://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/|title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar|website=Early Commemorative Coins|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Davidson, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, had reached a deal with Clemson administrators whereby he would sculpt a statue of its founder, [[Thomas G. Clemson]], in exchange for room, board and tuition.{{sfn|Brothers}} His completed plaster models were sent to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]] (CFA) by the [[Director of the United States Mint]], [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], on May 25, 1936.{{sfn|Taxay|p=179}} The CFA was by a 1921 [[executive order]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] charged with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins,{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi}} and Ross wanted the CFA\"s opinion, though she recognized there were visible defects in Davidson's design.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} The CFA chair, [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts|Charles Moore]] agreed with Ross's assessment in a letter dated June 1, 1936, and suggested the South Carolina commission hire an experienced medallist.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} According to Eric Brothers in his article on Davidson for ''[[The Numismatist]]'': \"The Sesquicentennial Committee would not budge; Davidson was Columbia\u2019s and Clemson\u2019s talented, adopted son.\"{{sfn|Brothers}}\n\nOn June 13, Ross returned the models to Davidson and wrote to James Hammond, chair of the Sesqui-Centennial Commission, stating she had returned the models and setting forth the Mint's technical requirements for coinage models.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} Thereafter, Davidson worked under the supervision of  [[Lee Lawrie]], sculptor-member of the CFA. The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each.  If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014at the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a palmetto tree, the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, wrote, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March 22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May 30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He further requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March 11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nIn order to have a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were only available to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2. Dealers were not able to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} causing them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a [[time capsule]] that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nBy 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and $100 by 1965. By 1980, they were $1,750 per set, a price that decreased thereafter.{{sfn|Bowers|p=346}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2018, lists the set for between $540 and $900, depending on condition, with individual pieces valued at a third of that.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1089}} An exceptional specimen from the Denver Mint (1936\u2013D) sold for $15,863 in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=CoinWeek|last=Ferguson|first=Mark|date=February 28, 2020|accessdate=February 29, 2020|url=https://coinweek.com/education/coin-grading/price-records-emerge-for-finest-cac-commemorative-half-dollars/|title=Price records emerge for finest CAC commemorative half dollars}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n==Sources==\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bowers\n  | first = Q.

A woman employed to drive a passenger motor vehicle is a chauffeuse.\n\nOriginally, such drivers  were often personal employees of the vehicle owner, but now in many cases specialist chauffeur service companies or individual drivers provide both driver and [[vehicle for hire]], although there are service companies that just provide the driver.\n\n==History==\nThe term ''chauffeur'' comes from the [[French language|French]] term for [[Stoker (occupation)|stoker]] because the earliest automobiles,<ref>{{cite news |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/01/22/101930350.pdf |quote=...but it simply means what we call \"fireman\", or what the English call \"stoker\"... |newspaper=The New York Times |date=22 January 1902 |access-date=25 November 2018 |format=PDF |title=Objects to \"Chauffeur\"}}</ref> like their [[railroad]] and sea vessel counterparts, were [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] and required the driver to stoke the engine. Early [[petrol]]/gasoline-powered motor cars, before the advent of electric ignition, were ignited by 'hot tubes' in the cylinder head which had to be pre-heated before the engine would start. Hence the term ''chauffeur'' which, in this context, means something like \"heater-upper\".

{"title_page": "Steam cracking", "text_new": "'''Steam cracking''' is a [[petrochemical]] process in which saturated [[hydrocarbon]]s are broken down into smaller, often unsaturated, hydrocarbons. It is the principal industrial method for producing the lighter [[alkene]]s (or commonly [[olefin]]s), including [[ethene]] (or [[ethylene]]) and [[propene]] (or [[propylene]]). Steam cracker units are facilities in which a feedstock such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), [[ethane]], [[propane]] or [[butane]] is thermally cracked through the use of steam in steam cracking furnaces to produce lighter hydrocarbons. The propane dehydrogenation process may be accomplished through different commercial technologies. The main differences between each of them concerns the catalyst employed, design of the reactor and strategies to achieve higher conversion rates.<ref>{{cite web|author=Giovanni Maggini |url=http://www.slideshare.net/intratec/technology-economics-propylene-via-propane-dehydrogenation-part-3 |title=Technology Economics: Propylene via Propane Dehydrogenation, Part 3 |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2013-04-17 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Olefins]] are useful precursors to myriad products.  Steam cracking is the core technology that supports the largest scale chemical processes, i.e. ethylene and propylene.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n== Process Description ==\n\n=== General ===\nIn steam cracking, a gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon feed like [[naphtha]], [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]], or [[ethane]] is diluted with steam and briefly heated in a furnace in the absence of oxygen.<ref name=realityck>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/J.ENG.2017.02.006|title=New Trends in Olefin Production|year=2017|last1=Amghizar|first1=Isma\u00ebl|last2=Vandewalle|first2=Laurien A.|last3=Van Geem|first3=Kevin M.|last4=Marin|first4=Guy B.|journal=Engineering|volume=3|issue=2|pages=171\u2013178}}</ref>  Typically, the reaction temperature is very high, at around 850 \u00b0C.  The reaction occurs rapidly: the residence time is on the order of milliseconds. Flow rates approach the [[speed of sound]]. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a transfer line [[heat exchanger]] or inside a quenching header using quench oil.<ref name=Ullmann>{{Ullmann|doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_045.pub3|tile=Ethylene|year=2009|last1=Zimmermann|first1=Heinz|last2=Walzl|first2=Roland|isbn=978-3527306732}}</ref>\n\nThe products produced in the reaction depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio, and on the cracking temperature and furnace residence time. Light hydrocarbon feeds such as [[ethane]], LPGs, or light [[naphtha]] give mainly lighter alkenes, including ethylene, propylene, and [[butadiene]]. Heavier hydrocarbon (full range and heavy naphthas as well as other refinery products) feeds give some of these same products, but also those rich in [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s and hydrocarbons suitable for inclusion in [[gasoline]] or [[fuel oil]].<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\nA higher cracking [[temperature]] (also referred to as severity) favors the production of [[ethene]] and [[benzene]], whereas lower severity produces higher amounts of [[propene]], C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products. The process also results in the slow deposition of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], a form of [[carbon]], on the reactor walls. This degrades the efficiency of the reactor, so reaction conditions are designed to minimize this. Nonetheless, a steam cracking furnace can usually only run for a few months at a time between de-cokings. Decokes require the furnace to be isolated from the process and then a flow of steam or a steam/air mixture is passed through the furnace coils. This converts the hard solid carbon layer to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Once this reaction is complete, the furnace can be returned to service.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\n=== Process details ===\nThe areas of an ethylene plant are:\n\n# steam cracking furnaces:\n# primary and secondary heat recovery with quench;\n# a dilution steam recycle system between the furnaces and the quench system;\n# primary compression of the cracked gas (3 stages of compression);\n# [[hydrogen sulfide]] and carbon dioxide removal (acid gas removal);\n# secondary compression (1 or 2 stages);\n# drying of the cracked gas;\n# cryogenic treatment;\n# all of the cold cracked gas stream goes to the demethanizer tower. The overhead stream from the demethanizer tower consists of all the hydrogen and methane that was in the cracked gas stream. Cryogenically (\u2212250 \u00b0F (\u2212157 \u00b0C)) treating this overhead stream separates hydrogen from methane. Methane recovery is critical to the economical operation of an ethylene plant.\n# the bottom stream from the demethanizer tower goes to the deethanizer tower. The overhead stream from the deethanizer tower consists of all the C2's that were in the cracked gas stream. The C2 stream contains acetylene, which is explosive above 200 kPa (29 psi). If the partial pressure of acetylene is expected to exceed these values, the C2 stream is partially hydrogenated. The C2's then proceed to a C2 splitter. The product ethylene is taken from the overhead of the tower and the ethane coming from the bottom of the splitter is recycled to the furnaces to be cracked again;\n# the bottom stream from the de-ethanizer tower goes to the depropanizer tower. The overhead stream from the depropanizer tower consists of all the C3's that were in the cracked gas stream. Before feeding the C3's to the C3 splitter, the stream is hydrogenated to convert the [[methylacetylene]] and [[propadiene]] ([[allene]]) mix. This stream is then sent to the C3 splitter. The overhead stream from the C3 splitter is product propylene and the bottom stream is propane which is sent back to the furnaces for cracking or used as fuel.\n# The bottom stream from the depropanizer tower is fed to the debutanizer tower. The overhead stream from the debutanizer is all of the C4's that were in the cracked gas stream. The bottom stream from the debutanizer (light pyrolysis gasoline) consists of everything in the cracked gas stream that is C5 or heavier.\n\nSince ethylene production is energy intensive, much effort has been dedicated to recovering heat from the gas leaving the furnaces. Most of the energy recovered from the cracked gas is used to make high pressure (1200 psig (8300 kPa)) steam. This steam is in turn used to drive the turbines for compressing cracked gas, the propylene refrigeration compressor, and the ethylene refrigeration compressor. An ethylene plant, once running, does not need to import steam to drive its steam turbines. A typical world scale ethylene plant (about 1.5 billion pounds of ethylene per year) uses a 45,000 horsepower (34,000 kW) cracked gas compressor, a 30,000 hp (22,000 kW) propylene compressor, and a 15,000 hp (11,000 kW) ethylene compressor.\n\n== Steam cracking furnaces licensors ==\n\nSeveral proprietary designs are available under a license that must be purchased from the design developer by any petroleum refining company desiring to construct and operate a Steam Cracking unit of a given design.\n\nThese are the major steam cracking furnaces designers and licensors:\n* [[McDermott International]] (formerly [[Chicago Bridge & Iron Company|CB&I]]), with Lummus Technology's license\n* [[TechnipFMC]] (formerly [[Technip]]) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technipfmc.com/en/what-we-do/onshore-offshore/Onshore-capabilities/Ethylene|title=Ethylene - TechnipFMC plc|website=www.technipfmc.com|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref>\n* [[Linde plc|Linde]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linde-engineering.com/en/process-plants/petrochemical-plants/steam_cracking_technology/cracking_furnaces_technology/index.html|title=Cracking furnace technology|website=Linde Engineering|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref>\n* [[KBR (company)|KBR]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kbr.com/en/solutions/technologies/process-technologies/petrochemical-technologies|title=Petrochemical Technologies {{!}} KBR|website=www.kbr.com|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n=== Related Articles ===\n* [[Petroleum]]\n* [[Petroleum refining processes|Petroleum Refining Processes]]\n* [[Natural gas]]\n* [[Cracking (chemistry)|Cracking]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hydrocarbons}}\n{{Alkenes}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Alkenes]]\n[[Category:Petroleum production]]\n", "text_old": "'''Steam cracking''' is a [[petrochemical]] process in which saturated [[hydrocarbon]]s are broken down into smaller, often unsaturated, hydrocarbons. It is the principal industrial method for producing the lighter [[alkene]]s (or commonly [[olefin]]s), including [[ethene]] (or [[ethylene]]) and [[propene]] (or [[propylene]]). Steam cracker units are facilities in which a feedstock such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), [[ethane]], [[propane]] or [[butane]] is thermally cracked through the use of steam in steam cracking furnaces to produce lighter hydrocarbons. The propane dehydrogenation process may be accomplished through different commercial technologies. The main differences between each of them concerns the catalyst employed, design of the reactor and strategies to achieve higher conversion rates.<ref>{{cite web|author=Giovanni Maggini |url=http://www.slideshare.net/intratec/technology-economics-propylene-via-propane-dehydrogenation-part-3 |title=Technology Economics: Propylene via Propane Dehydrogenation, Part 3 |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2013-04-17 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Olefins]] are useful precursors to myriad products.  Steam cracking is the core technology that supports the largest scale chemical processes, i.e. ethylene and propylene.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n== Process Description ==\n\n=== General ===\nIn steam cracking, a gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon feed like [[naphtha]], [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]], or [[ethane]] is diluted with steam and briefly heated in a furnace in the absence of oxygen.<ref name=realityck>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/J.ENG.2017.02.006|title=New Trends in Olefin Production|year=2017|last1=Amghizar|first1=Isma\u00ebl|last2=Vandewalle|first2=Laurien A.|last3=Van Geem|first3=Kevin M.|last4=Marin|first4=Guy B.|journal=Engineering|volume=3|issue=2|pages=171\u2013178}}</ref>  Typically, the reaction temperature is very high, at around 850 \u00b0C.  The reaction occurs rapidly: the residence time is on the order of milliseconds. Flow rates approach the [[speed of sound]]. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a transfer line [[heat exchanger]] or inside a quenching header using quench oil.<ref name=Ullmann>{{Ullmann|doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_045.pub3|tile=Ethylene|year=2009|last1=Zimmermann|first1=Heinz|last2=Walzl|first2=Roland|isbn=978-3527306732}}</ref>\n\nThe products produced in the reaction depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio, and on the cracking temperature and furnace residence time. Light hydrocarbon feeds such as [[ethane]], LPGs, or light [[naphtha]] give mainly lighter alkenes, including ethylene, propylene, and [[butadiene]]. Heavier hydrocarbon (full range and heavy naphthas as well as other refinery products) feeds give some of these same products, but also those rich in [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s and hydrocarbons suitable for inclusion in [[gasoline]] or [[fuel oil]].<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\nA higher cracking [[temperature]] (also referred to as severity) favors the production of [[ethene]] and [[benzene]], whereas lower severity produces higher amounts of [[propene]], C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products. The process also results in the slow deposition of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], a form of [[carbon]], on the reactor walls. This degrades the efficiency of the reactor, so reaction conditions are designed to minimize this. Nonetheless, a steam cracking furnace can usually only run for a few months at a time between de-cokings. Decokes require the furnace to be isolated from the process and then a flow of steam or a steam/air mixture is passed through the furnace coils. This converts the hard solid carbon layer to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Once this reaction is complete, the furnace can be returned to service.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\n=== Process details ===\nThe areas of an ethylene plant are:\n\n# steam cracking furnaces:\n# primary and secondary heat recovery with quench;\n# a dilution steam recycle system between the furnaces and the quench system;\n# primary compression of the cracked gas (3 stages of compression);\n# [[hydrogen sulfide]] and carbon dioxide removal (acid gas removal);\n# secondary compression (1 or 2 stages);\n# drying of the cracked gas;\n# cryogenic treatment;\n# all of the cold cracked gas stream goes to the demethanizer tower. The overhead stream from the demethanizer tower consists of all the hydrogen and methane that was in the cracked gas stream. Cryogenically (\u2212250 \u00b0F (\u2212157 \u00b0C)) treating this overhead stream separates hydrogen from methane. Methane recovery is critical to the economical operation of an ethylene plant.\n# the bottom stream from the demethanizer tower goes to the deethanizer tower. The overhead stream from the deethanizer tower consists of all the C2's that were in the cracked gas stream. The C2 stream contains acetylene, which is explosive above 200 kPa (29 psi). If the partial pressure of acetylene is expected to exceed these values, the C2 stream is partially hydrogenated. The C2's then proceed to a C2 splitter. The product ethylene is taken from the overhead of the tower and the ethane coming from the bottom of the splitter is recycled to the furnaces to be cracked again;\n# the bottom stream from the de-ethanizer tower goes to the depropanizer tower. The overhead stream from the depropanizer tower consists of all the C3's that were in the cracked gas stream. Before feeding the C3's to the C3 splitter, the stream is hydrogenated to convert the [[methylacetylene]] and [[propadiene]] ([[allene]]) mix. This stream is then sent to the C3 splitter. The overhead stream from the C3 splitter is product propylene and the bottom stream is propane which is sent back to the furnaces for cracking or used as fuel.\n# The bottom stream from the depropanizer tower is fed to the debutanizer tower. The overhead stream from the debutanizer is all of the C4's that were in the cracked gas stream. The bottom stream from the debutanizer (light pyrolysis gasoline) consists of everything in the cracked gas stream that is C5 or heavier.\n\nSince ethylene production is energy intensive, much effort has been dedicated to recovering heat from the gas leaving the furnaces. Most of the energy recovered from the cracked gas is used to make high pressure (1200 psig (83 bar)) steam. This steam is in turn used to drive the turbines for compressing cracked gas, the propylene refrigeration compressor, and the ethylene refrigeration compressor. An ethylene plant, once running, does not need to import steam to drive its steam turbines. A typical world scale ethylene plant (about 1.5 billion pounds of ethylene per year) uses a 45,000 horsepower (34,000 kW) cracked gas compressor, a 30,000 hp (22,000 kW) propylene compressor, and a 15,000 hp (11,000 kW) ethylene compressor.\n\n== Steam cracking furnaces licensors ==\n\nSeveral proprietary designs are available under a license that must be purchased from the design developer by any petroleum refining company desiring to construct and operate a Steam Cracking unit of a given design.\n\nThese are the major steam cracking furnaces designers and licensors:\n* [[McDermott International]] (formerly [[Chicago Bridge & Iron Company|CB&I]]), with Lummus Technology's license\n* [[TechnipFMC]] (formerly [[Technip]]) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technipfmc.com/en/what-we-do/onshore-offshore/Onshore-capabilities/Ethylene|title=Ethylene - TechnipFMC plc|website=www.technipfmc.com|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref>\n* [[Linde plc|Linde]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linde-engineering.com/en/process-plants/petrochemical-plants/steam_cracking_technology/cracking_furnaces_technology/index.html|title=Cracking furnace technology|website=Linde Engineering|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref>\n* [[KBR (company)|KBR]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kbr.com/en/solutions/technologies/process-technologies/petrochemical-technologies|title=Petrochemical Technologies {{!}} KBR|website=www.kbr.com|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n=== Related Articles ===\n* [[Petroleum]]\n* [[Petroleum refining processes|Petroleum Refining Processes]]\n* [[Natural gas]]\n* [[Cracking (chemistry)|Cracking]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hydrocarbons}}\n{{Alkenes}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Alkenes]]\n[[Category:Petroleum production]]\n", "name_user": "FrankPas", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_cracking"}

It consists of six episodes. ''Spooks'' follows the actions of Section D, a [[counter-terrorism]] division of the British [[MI5|Security Services]] (MI5). Among the storylines, main character [[Tom Quinn (Spooks)|Tom Quinn]] faces dilemmas living a double life with his girlfriend, who at first does not know he is really a spy, and [[Tessa Phillips]] is running phantom agents for monetary gain. [[Matthew Macfadyen]], [[Keeley Hawes]], [[David Oyelowo]], [[Peter Firth]], [[Jenny Agutter]], [[Lisa Faulkner]], [[Esther Hall]], [[Heather Cave]], [[Hugh Simon]] and Greame Mearns are listed as the main cast.\n\n[[Kudos Film and Television]] developed ''Spooks'' after releasing [[Channel 4]] medical drama ''[[Psychos (TV series)|Psychos]]'' in 1999, though the company initially faced friction from television networks which saw no potential in a post-[[Cold War]] spy show. The producers later successfully pitched the series to the BBC after the networks' commissioning teams were replaced. Four episodes were being written when the [[September 11 attacks]] took place, and the some scenes were rewritten to take the event into account to show the audience ''Spooks's'' goal of fighting terrorism. Throughout production, the producers were advised by former [[intelligence officer]]s from the Security Service, [[KGB]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Filming took place from November 2001 to March 2002.\n\nThe first series was seen by an average of 7.49&nbsp;million, and received generally favourable reviews from critics, with some comparing the series to American espionage-based series such as ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''. The second episode attracted controversy after a scene which depicted the brutal death of main character [[Helen Flynn]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]) attracted more than 250 complaints. As a result of the series, MI5's website saw a surge in a number of applications to the organisation by viewers. ''Spooks'' was awarded a [[British Academy Television Awards]] (BAFTA) for Best Drama Series, and was nominated for two other BAFTAs and three [[Royal Television Society]] Awards. The first series was released on DVD on 16 June 2003 in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]], 18 August 2003 in Region 4, and 13 January 2004 in Region 1.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of Spooks episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#E5E4E2 |overall=5 |series=5 |title=18 |director=13 |writer=29 |airdate=21 |viewers=9 |country=UK |titleR=<ref name=spooks1dvd>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Secret Credits |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1)}}</ref> |directorR=<ref name=spooks1dvd/> |writerR=<ref name=spooks1dvd/> |viewersR=<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-30? |title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes (See weeks ending May&nbsp;19 to 23 Jun 2002) |publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] |accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref> |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Spooks (series 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = [[Thou Shalt Not Kill (Spooks)|Thou Shalt Not Kill]]\n |WrittenBy = [[David Wolstencroft]]\n |DirectedBy = [[Bharat Nalluri]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|5|13|df=y}}\n |Aux4 = 9.60\n |ShortSummary = Section D of [[MI5]] is on the case when a [[car bomb]] detonates in [[Liverpool]], killing [[family planning]] doctor Sarah Lynott ([[Karen Westwood]]).

[[David Wolstencroft]] was credited as the series creator, Simon Crawford Collins as the producer, and Jane Featherstone as the series producer. The executive producers of the first series were Kudos director Stephen Garrett and Head of Independent Drama Commissioning for the BBC, Gareth Neame. The series includes three screenwriters, and three directors. Wolstencroft wrote the first two episodes and finale of series one. [[Simon Mirren]] wrote the third episode. [[Howard Brenton]] wrote the last three episodes, co-writing the finale with Wolstencroft.<ref name=press/> The producers hired Brenton for his \"radical\" and \"provocative\" style. By the time he was hired it had been sixteen years since he last wrote for television.<ref name=origin/>\n\nThe producers from Kudos spent up to three months meeting several potential directors to work on the show, but none shared their views about the show's style until [[Bharat Nalluri]]. The style the director used was inspired by [[Bollywood]] films, as well as American television. According to Wolstencroft, Nalluri \"directs as I see.\"<ref name=look/> Three directors were chosen, each working on two episodes; Nalluri directed the first two episodes, [[Rob Bailey (director)|Rob Bailey]] directed the next two episodes, and [[Andy Wilson (director)|Andy Wilson]] directed the last two episodes. Sue Gibson and Sean Bobbitt served as the [[Cinematographer|directors of photography]], with Mark Goddard and Francesco Reidy serving as first [[assistant directors]]. Colin Green and Soren B. Ebbe were the series editors, while David Crozier and Andrew Sissions served as sound recordists. Leila Kirkpatrick was the [[line producer]] and Linda Stefansdottir was the [[production designer]], while [[Andrea Galer]] was the costume designer, and Alison Davies was the make-up designer. The casting director for the first series was Gail Stevens. Karen Wilson was the [[script editor]], and Ralph Cameron and Malcolm Treen were the [[location manager]]s.<ref name=press/>\n\n===Conception===\nKudos began to develop the show after producing the [[Channel 4]] medical drama series ''[[Psychos (TV series)|Psychos]]'' in 1999. Kudos wished to explore series ideas that saw beyond typical \"[[police precinct|precinct]]-based dramas\" ([[Crime film|crime]] and [[Medical drama|medical]]). Stephen Garrett decided on developing a spy drama after coming across [[John le Carr\u00e9]] novels at a [[Waterstone's]] bookstore, and came to realise that MI5 or MI6 had not been featured as the setting for shows before. He felt the benefit of a spy show is that rather than in a crime drama where the protagonists take their work home with them, spies are given the added dimension that they cannot reveal their work even to their loved ones. In the meantime, Wolstencroft, who wrote ''Psychos'', was also developing a spy drama, albeit as a film. When Kudos contacted him, they agreed they should work together to create a television series based on his idea, which was not to glamourise the world of spies, instead showing the audience that spies work in a \"shitty job\". Kudos later pitched the show to all the major British television networks; however none of them were as enthusiastic as Kudos, as they did not see the potential of a post-[[Cold War]] spy series. After the commissioning teams from the networks were replaced, Kudos again pitched the show, albeit reinvented, and as a result [[Lorraine Heggessey]], controller of [[BBC One]], commissioned the show after planning to introduce \"braver\", \"dynamic\" and \"pacier\" shows to attract a younger audience for the channel.<ref name=origin>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=The Origin of Spooks |people=Simon Crawford Collins, Jane Featherstone, Stephen Garrett, [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nThe two main writers, Brenton and Wolstencroft, had different styles and influences in their scripts. Wolstencroft was influenced by American television to make the episodes pacier.<ref name=look>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=The Look of Spooks |people=Stephen Garrett, [[Bharat Nalluri]], [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 1 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> His chosen writing style was a mixture of the \"grittyness\" of le Carr\u00e9's works and [[James Bond]]-like fantasies.<ref name=world>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=The World of Spies |people=Stephen Garrett, [[Matthew Macfadyen]], [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 3 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> While writing the series, the writer introduced a set of \"MI5 terminology\", terms used by the main characters in the series. According to Oyelowo, Wolstencroft's scripts included more spy terms, stating \"we curse David Wolstencroft often. His dialogue tends to be the most chewy,\" and the actors had to learn them as if they spoke as such on a daily basis.<ref name=ep4com>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=MI5 Terminology |people=[[Keeley Hawes]], [[David Oyelowo]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> Brenton, meanwhile, adopted the same writing style based on early episodes of ''[[Taggart]]'', a Scottish-based crime drama; the writer was impressed by the show's ability to add more to the plot halfway through. He also took inspirations from novels including le Carr\u00e9's ''[[Tinker, Tailor, soldier, Spy]]''.<ref name=ep4com2>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Audio Commentary for Episode 4 |people=[[Rob Bailey (director)|Rob Bailey]], [[Howard Brenton]], Simon Crawford Collins |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> Mirren wrote \"One Last Dance\", which he felt was difficult to write as he had to tie two main storylines together.<ref name=ep3com>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Audio Commentary for Episode 3 |people=[[Rob Bailey (director)|Rob Bailey]], Simon Crawford Collins, [[Keeley Hawes]], [[Simon Mirren]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> Brenton and Wolstencroft collaborated to write \"Lesser of Two Evils\" due to timing constraints.

As a result, the episodes were rewritten to take account of the events to assure the audience that the show is about fighting terrorism. According to Wolstencroft, the attacks \"sidewinded\" the show, \"perversely made it as relevant as can be,\" and \"commuted a great sense of responsibility\" on ''Spooks''.<ref name=terror>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=The Terror Question |people=Simon Crawford Collins, Jane Featherstone, [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the writing, and also the filming stages of the series, the writers were advised by ex-MI5 officers who gave insight into how the characters operate and how their personal lives would be affected by it.<ref name=press>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/05_may/07/spooks_presspack.pdf |title=Spooks: MI5 not 9 to 5 |date=5 May 2002 |accessdate=7 April 2012 |work=BBC Press Office |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> Among the advisors were Nick Day, who worked in counter-terrorism in the Security Services, Viktor Abramkin, a UK-based former [[KGB]] officer,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1929519.stm |title=Agents team up for drama |date=14 April 2002 |accessdate=7 April 2012 |publisher=[[BBC News]] }}</ref> and Mike Baker, an ex-CIA agent.<ref name=press/> When including terrorists, the BBC often has the responsibility to portray people with as much balance as possible for both sides.<ref name=terror/> The first series finale was heavily researched, as the episode was based on real life instances in which terrorists agreed to work with the authorities in Colombia. Meanwhile, a scene in which Tom and Patrick strip naked to ensure they are not bugged came from the producers' sources.<ref name=ep6com/> The sources also advised the producers how to tail targets without being spotted.<ref name=ep3com/>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"Imagine moving in with the man you love and then discover you don't even know his real name?

The idea was originally going to be used in the series finale. However, the producers did not know how to fill in episode two, so the death was moved up. According to Wolstencroft, the inclusion of Helen's death was to give the audience the message that \"the world of Spooks isn't the world where the cavalry always arrive, because in reality these people [MI5] do risk their lives on our behalf and they do get into sticky situations with genuinely nasty people.\" The producers also wanted main characters to die on occasion rather than on a weekly or bi-weekly basis; otherwise it would show MI5 officers as not doing their jobs properly.<ref name=shock>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=The Helen Flynn Shock |people=Simon Crawford Collins, Jane Featherstone, [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 1 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> Although ''Spooks'' is a serious show, the writers add occasional humour from the characters. According to Wolstencroft, he felt that anybody who works in such an occupation with high responsibilities tends to have humour around, and that those people make jokes even though they have seen \"heinous things\". This became the basis for creating Jools Siviter.<ref name=jools>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Intelligence Report \u2013 Jools Siviter |people=[[Matthew Macfadyen]], [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref>\n\nThe first series of ''Spooks'' saw various storylines involving the main characters. Among these were Danny's obsession with money and spending, by hacking into a credit card database to fool it to give him a better credit rating, and the discovery that Tessa is running phantom agents to pocket their money. Those storylines were intended by Brenton and Wolstencroft to show the audience that the MI5 officers are tempted by money.<ref name=ep2com/><ref name=ep4com/> A principle story arc is Tom dealing with the complexities of his relationship with Ellie, who at first does not know he is a spy. This storyline was based on Mike Baker, whose wife did not know he was a spy for the first six months they were together.<ref name=press/> As the series progressed, there were more difficulties with the relationship; Brenton wrote Tom's position as if the character did not see the problem. The same episode also introduced the sexual tension between Danny and Zoe.<ref name=ep5com/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Night view from 15th floor of Nido Spitalfields.jpg|thumb|alt=A skyline of modern buildings underneath an orange sky.

Filming was usually done with [[Telephoto lens|long lens]] cameras, which proved difficult for the crew as many filming location were short on space.<ref name=ep1com/> The scenes where Tom reveals he is a spy to Ellie in \"Traitor's Gate\" were filmed using [[hand-held camera]]s, the first time they were used in the series.<ref name=ep6com/> By the time the crew filmed the series finale, hand-held cameras were mostly used. The cameras allowed for more intimate filming as opposed to [[Professional video camera|shoulder-operated cameras]]. The downside to the hand-held cameras was that they can only shoot four minutes worth of footage from each [[film stock]]. In addition, the operators at first hated using the cameras.<ref name=ep6com/>\n\nThe episodes of the first series were not filmed in the order they were broadcast; \"Traitor's Gate\" was the third episode to be filmed, while \"One Last Dance\" was the fourth.<ref name=ep4com/><ref name=ep3com/> While filming \"One Last Dance\" and \"The Rose Bed Memoirs\", Macfadyen had a [[red eye (medicine)|bloodshot left eye]]. To cover it, sometimes Macfadyen had to hide the left side of his face from the camera. At other times, the actor wore [[sunglasses]].<ref name=\"ep5com\">{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Audio Commentary for Episode 5 |people=[[Howard Brenton]], Jane Featherstone, Colin Green, [[David Oyelowo]], [[Andy Wilson (director)|Andy Wilson]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 3 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref><ref name=ep3com/> The series made use of real firearms that were decommissioned from service.

The producers agreed that adding credits would be a waste of time, and that the viewers would pay no attention to them. However, they also saw this as an opportunity; as ''Spooks'' is a spy show, Wolstencroft had the idea that it would be \"cool\" to have a show that was anonymous, and it would fit the spirit of the series.<ref>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Taking (Away) the Credit |people=Jane Featherstone, [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\n===Broadcast, ratings and impact===\n[[File:Spooks 1 ratings.png|thumb|Final ratings for the first series]]\nBefore broadcasting began, the BBC considered airing the show on a Saturday night timeslot as its research found that any potential viewers were less likely to watch television on Saturdays than most other nights of the week; the BBC hoped that ''Spooks'' would boost its timeslot.<ref name=look/> However, the series instead broadcast on Mondays.

It consists of six episodes. ''Spooks'' follows the actions of Section D, a [[counter-terrorism]] division of the British [[MI5|Security Services]] (MI5). Among the storylines, main character [[Tom Quinn (Spooks)|Tom Quinn]] faces dilemmas living a double life with his girlfriend, who at first does not know he is really a spy, and [[Tessa Phillips]] is running phantom agents for monetary gain. [[Matthew Macfadyen]], [[Keeley Hawes]], [[David Oyelowo]], [[Peter Firth]], [[Jenny Agutter]], [[Lisa Faulkner]], [[Esther Hall]], [[Heather Cave]], [[Hugh Simon]] and Greame Mearns are listed as the main cast.\n\n[[Kudos Film and Television]] developed ''Spooks'' after releasing [[Channel 4]] medical drama ''[[Psychos (TV series)|Psychos]]'' in 1999, though the company initially faced friction from television networks which saw no potential in a post-[[Cold War]] spy show. The producers later successfully pitched the series to the BBC after the networks' commissioning teams were replaced. Four episodes were being written when the [[September 11 attacks]] took place, and the some scenes were rewritten to take the event into account to show the audience ''Spooks's'' goal of fighting terrorism. Throughout production, the producers were advised by former [[intelligence officer]]s from the Security Service, [[KGB]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Filming took place from November 2001 to March 2002.\n\nThe first series was seen by an average of 7.49&nbsp;million, and received generally favourable reviews from critics, with some comparing the series to American espionage-based series such as ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''. The second episode attracted controversy after a scene which depicted the brutal death of main character [[Helen Flynn]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]) attracted more than 250 complaints. As a result of the series, MI5's website saw a surge in a number of applications to the organisation by viewers. ''Spooks'' was awarded a [[British Academy Television Awards]] (BAFTA) for Best Drama Series, and was nominated for two other BAFTAs and three [[Royal Television Society]] Awards. The first series was released on DVD on 16 June 2003 in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]], 18 August 2003 in Region 4, and 13 January 2004 in Region 1.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of Spooks episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#E5E4E2 |overall=5 |series=5 |title=18 |director=13 |writer=29 |airdate=21 |viewers=9 |country=UK |titleR=<ref name=spooks1dvd>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Secret Credits |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1)}}</ref> |directorR=<ref name=spooks1dvd/> |writerR=<ref name=spooks1dvd/> |viewersR=<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-30? |title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes (See weeks ending May&nbsp;19 to 23 Jun 2002) |publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] |accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref> |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Spooks (series 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = [[Thou Shalt Not Kill (Spooks)|Thou Shalt Not Kill]]\n |WrittenBy = [[David Wolstencroft]]\n |DirectedBy = [[Bharat Nalluri]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|5|13|df=y}}\n |Aux4 = 9.60\n |ShortSummary = Section D of [[MI5]] is on the case when a [[car bomb]] detonates in [[Liverpool]], killing [[family planning]] doctor Sarah Lynott ([[Karen Westwood]]).

Cranitch had previously appeared in several other dramas as [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) operators.<ref name=press/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Crew===\nThe first series of ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'' was produced by [[Kudos (production company)|Kudos Film and Television]] for the [[BBC]]. [[David Wolstencroft]] was credited as the series creator, Simon Crawford Collins as the producer, and Jane Featherstone as the series producer. The executive producers of the first series were Kudos director Stephen Garrett and Head of Independent Drama Commissioning for the BBC, Gareth Neame. The series includes three screenwriters, and three directors. Wolstencroft wrote the first two episodes and finale of series one. [[Simon Mirren]] wrote the third episode. [[Howard Brenton]] wrote the last three episodes, co-writing the finale with Wolstencroft.<ref name=press/> The producers hired Brenton for his \"radical\" and \"provocative\" style. By the time he was hired it had been sixteen years since he last wrote for television.<ref name=origin/>\n\nThe producers from Kudos spent up to three months meeting several potential directors to work on the show, but none shared their views about the show's style until [[Bharat Nalluri]]. The style the director used was inspired by [[Bollywood]] films, as well as American television. According to Wolstencroft, Nalluri \"directs as I see.\"<ref name=look/> Three directors were chosen, each working on two episodes; Nalluri directed the first two episodes, [[Rob Bailey (director)|Rob Bailey]] directed the next two episodes, and [[Andy Wilson (director)|Andy Wilson]] directed the last two episodes. Sue Gibson and Sean Bobbitt served as the [[Cinematographer|directors of photography]], with Mark Goddard and Francesco Reidy serving as first [[assistant directors]]. Colin Green and Soren B. Ebbe were the series editors, while David Crozier and Andrew Sissions served as sound recordists. Leila Kirkpatrick was the [[line producer]] and Linda Stefansdottir was the [[production designer]], while [[Andrea Galer]] was the costume designer, and Alison Davies was the make-up designer. The casting director for the first series was Gail Stevens. Karen Wilson was the [[script editor]], and Ralph Cameron and Malcolm Treen were the [[location manager]]s.<ref name=press/>\n\n===Conception===\nKudos began to develop the show after producing the [[Channel 4]] medical drama series ''[[Psychos (TV series)|Psychos]]'' in 1999. Kudos wished to explore series ideas that saw beyond typical \"[[police precinct|precinct]]-based dramas\" ([[Crime film|crime]] and [[Medical drama|medical]]). Stephen Garrett decided on developing a spy drama after coming across [[John le Carr\u00e9]] novels at a [[Waterstone's]] bookstore, and came to realise that MI5 or MI6 had not been featured as the setting for shows before. He felt the benefit of a spy show is that rather than in a crime drama where the protagonists take their work home with them, spies are given the added dimension that they cannot reveal their work even to their loved ones. In the meantime, Wolstencroft, who wrote ''Psychos'', was also developing a spy drama, albeit as a film. When Kudos contacted him, they agreed they should work together to create a television series based on his idea, which was not to glamourise the world of spies, instead showing the audience that spies work in a \"shitty job\". Kudos later pitched the show to all the major British television networks; however none of them were as enthusiastic as Kudos, as they did not see the potential of a post-[[Cold War]] spy series. After the commissioning teams from the networks were replaced, Kudos again pitched the show, albeit reinvented, and as a result [[Lorraine Heggessey]], controller of [[BBC One]], commissioned the show after planning to introduce \"braver\", \"dynamic\" and \"pacier\" shows to attract a younger audience for the channel.<ref name=origin>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=The Origin of Spooks |people=Simon Crawford Collins, Jane Featherstone, Stephen Garrett, [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nThe two main writers, Brenton and Wolstencroft, had different styles and influences in their scripts. Wolstencroft was influenced by American television to make the episodes pacier.<ref name=look>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=The Look of Spooks |people=Stephen Garrett, [[Bharat Nalluri]], [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 1 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> His chosen writing style was a mixture of the \"grittyness\" of le Carr\u00e9's works and [[James Bond]]-like fantasies.<ref name=world>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=The World of Spies |people=Stephen Garrett, [[Matthew Macfadyen]], [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 3 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> While writing the series, the writer introduced a set of \"MI5 terminology\", terms used by the main characters in the series. According to Oyelowo, Wolstencroft's scripts included more spy terms, stating \"we curse David Wolstencroft often. His dialogue tends to be the most chewy,\" and the actors had to learn them as if they spoke as such on a daily basis.<ref name=ep4com>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=MI5 Terminology |people=[[Keeley Hawes]], [[David Oyelowo]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> Brenton, meanwhile, adopted the same writing style based on early episodes of ''[[Taggart]]'', a Scottish-based crime drama; the writer was impressed by the show's ability to add more to the plot halfway through. He also took inspirations from novels including le Carr\u00e9's ''[[Tinker, Tailor, soldier, Spy]]''.<ref name=ep4com>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Audio Commentary for Episode 4 |people=[[Rob Bailey (director)|Rob Bailey]], [[Howard Brenton]], Simon Crawford Collins |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> Mirren wrote \"One Last Dance\", which he felt was difficult to write as he had to tie two main storylines together.<ref name=ep3com>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Audio Commentary for Episode 3 |people=[[Rob Bailey (director)|Rob Bailey]], Simon Crawford Collins, [[Keeley Hawes]], [[Simon Mirren]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> Brenton and Wolstencroft collaborated to write \"Lesser of Two Evils\" due to timing constraints. Wolstencroft pitched the story, and then each writer wrote 30 pages of dialogue.<ref name=ep4com/>\n\nThe pilot originally underwent 30 rewrites and four separate story ideas before the BBC was satisfied with it.<ref name=ep1com>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Audio Commentary for Episode 1 |people=Jane Featherstone, [[Bharat Nalluri]], [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 1 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> Similarly, the second episode went through four rewrites.<ref name=ep2com>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Audio Commentary for Episode 2 |people=Simon Crawford Collins, [[Bharat Nalluri]], [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 1 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> After four episodes were written, the [[September 11 attacks]] took place, resulting in three thousand deaths in the United States. As a result, the episodes were rewritten to take account of the events to assure the audience that the show is about fighting terrorism. According to Wolstencroft, the attacks \"sidewinded\" the show, \"perversely made it as relevant as can be,\" and \"commuted a great sense of responsibility\" on ''Spooks''.<ref name=terror>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=The Terror Question |people=Simon Crawford Collins, Jane Featherstone, [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the writing, and also the filming stages of the series, the writers were advised by ex-MI5 officers who gave insight into how the characters operate and how their personal lives would be affected by it.<ref name=press>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/05_may/07/spooks_presspack.pdf |title=Spooks: MI5 not 9 to 5 |date=5 May 2002 |accessdate=7 April 2012 |work=BBC Press Office |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> Among the advisors were Nick Day, who worked in counter-terrorism in the Security Services, Viktor Abramkin, a UK-based former [[KGB]] officer,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1929519.stm |title=Agents team up for drama |date=14 April 2002 |accessdate=7 April 2012 |publisher=[[BBC News]] }}</ref> and Mike Baker, an ex-CIA agent.<ref name=press/> When including terrorists, the BBC often has the responsibility to portray people with as much balance as possible for both sides.<ref name=terror/> The first series finale was heavily researched, as the episode was based on real life instances in which terrorists agreed to work with the authorities in Colombia. Meanwhile, a scene in which Tom and Patrick strip naked to ensure they are not bugged came from the producers' sources.<ref name=ep6com/> The sources also advised the producers how to tail targets without being spotted.<ref name=ep3com/>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"Imagine moving in with the man you love and then discover you don't even know his real name?

The idea was originally going to be used in the series finale. However, the producers did not know how to fill in episode two, so the death was moved up. According to Wolstencroft, the inclusion of Helen's death was to give the audience the message that \"the world of Spooks isn't the world where the cavalry always arrive, because in reality these people [MI5] do risk their lives on our behalf and they do get into sticky situations with genuinely nasty people.\" The producers also wanted main characters to die on occasion rather than on a weekly or bi-weekly basis; otherwise it would show MI5 officers as not doing their jobs properly.<ref name=shock>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=The Helen Flynn Shock |people=Simon Crawford Collins, Jane Featherstone, [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 1 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> Although ''Spooks'' is a serious show, the writers add occasional humour from the characters. According to Wolstencroft, he felt that anybody who works in such an occupation with high responsibilities tends to have humour around, and that those people make jokes even though they have seen \"heinous things\". This became the basis for creating Jools Siviter.<ref name=jools>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Intelligence Report \u2013 Jools Siviter |people=[[Matthew Macfadyen]], [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref>\n\nThe first series of ''Spooks'' saw various storylines involving the main characters. Among these were Danny's obsession with money and spending, by hacking into a credit card database to fool it to give him a better credit rating, and the discovery that Tessa is running phantom agents to pocket their money. Those storylines were intended by Brenton and Wolstencroft to show the audience that the MI5 officers are tempted by money.<ref name=ep2com/><ref name=ep4com/> A principle story arc is Tom dealing with the complexities of his relationship with Ellie, who at first does not know he is a spy. This storyline was based on Mike Baker, whose wife did not know he was a spy for the first six months they were together.<ref name=press/> As the series progressed, there were more difficulties with the relationship; Brenton wrote Tom's position as if the character did not see the problem. The same episode also introduced the sexual tension between Danny and Zoe.<ref name=ep5com/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Night view from 15th floor of Nido Spitalfields.jpg|thumb|alt=A skyline of modern buildings underneath an orange sky.

Filming was usually done with [[Telephoto lens|long lens]] cameras, which proved difficult for the crew as many filming location were short on space.<ref name=ep1com/> The scenes where Tom reveals he is a spy to Ellie in \"Traitor's Gate\" were filmed using [[hand-held camera]]s, the first time they were used in the series.<ref name=ep6com/> By the time the crew filmed the series finale, hand-held cameras were mostly used. The cameras allowed for more intimate filming as opposed to [[Professional video camera|shoulder-operated cameras]]. The downside to the hand-held cameras was that they can only shoot four minutes worth of footage from each [[film stock]]. In addition, the operators at first hated using the cameras.<ref name=ep6com/>\n\nThe episodes of the first series were not filmed in the order they were broadcast; \"Traitor's Gate\" was the third episode to be filmed, while \"One Last Dance\" was the fourth.<ref name=ep4com/><ref name=ep3com/> While filming \"One Last Dance\" and \"The Rose Bed Memoirs\", Macfadyen had a [[red eye (medicine)|bloodshot left eye]]. To cover it, sometimes Macfadyen had to hide the left side of his face from the camera. At other times, the actor wore [[sunglasses]].<ref name=\"ep5com\">{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Audio Commentary for Episode 5 |people=[[Howard Brenton]], Jane Featherstone, Colin Green, [[David Oyelowo]], [[Andy Wilson (director)|Andy Wilson]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 3 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref><ref name=ep3com/> The series made use of real firearms that were decommissioned from service. Certain cast members, including Oyelowo, handled firearms at some point in the series.

The scenes leading up to Mary's apprehension in \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\" were filmed at [[Borough Market]] in [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]]. The same episode made use of [[Covent Garden]].<ref name=ep1com/> \"One Last Dance\" had scenes filmed in [[Roehampton]] and [[High Commission of New Zealand, London|New Zealand House]]. In the latter's case, the actors were filmed on the top floors, where the wind forced the actors to raise their voices so the sound unit could hear them.<ref name=ep3com/> Scenes were filmed in [[Hampstead Heath]] in \"Traitor's Gate\", while one scene was filmed in [[Trafalgar Square]] and at [[London Bridge]] for \"The Rose Bed Memoirs\".

The editors would work on two episodes simultaneously.<ref>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Editing Spooks \u2013 Colin Green |people=Colin Green |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 1 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref><ref name=\"nalluri\">{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Directing Ep. 1\u20132 \u2013 Bharat Nalluri |people=[[Bharat Nalluri]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 1 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref> Following the completion of the episodes, Muskett added the score for them.<ref name=nalluri/> The episodes include [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] sequences. Although the sequences were presented in a similar vein to the American action series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', the split screen idea did not come from the show itself; Nalluri thought of it independently after visiting a pub one night after filming wrapped up.<ref name=ep1com/> The series also introduced the premise of not including any production [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]]. The producers agreed that adding credits would be a waste of time, and that the viewers would pay no attention to them. However, they also saw this as an opportunity; as ''Spooks'' is a spy show, Wolstencroft had the idea that it would be \"cool\" to have a show that was anonymous, and it would fit the spirit of the series.<ref>{{cite video |year=2003 |title=Taking (Away) the Credit |people=Jane Featherstone, [[David Wolstencroft]] |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 1) Disc 2 |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\n===Broadcast, ratings and impact===\n[[File:Spooks 1 ratings.png|thumb|Final ratings for the first series]]\nBefore broadcasting began, the BBC considered airing the show on a Saturday night timeslot as its research found that any potential viewers were less likely to watch television on Saturdays than most other nights of the week; the BBC hoped that ''Spooks'' would boost its timeslot.<ref name=look/> However, the series instead broadcast on Mondays.

Landmann added; \"Each story is complex and convincing, plus the scripts are very well written. A lot goes on in each episode, and it's detrimental for a show like this to keep the action and tension going as fast as possible.\" The reviewer also noted that having only six episodes worked as an advantage over American television, stating \"while this seems incredibly short, the idea is actually very good. This ensures that each episode is strong in content and execution. American shows tend to run for 20\u201325 episodes a season, and while developments occur, there are always the filler episodes.

A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] after a highly successful episode of ''[[Happy Days]]'', it starred [[Robin Williams]] as Mork, an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] who comes to Earth from the planet Ork in a small, one-Orkan egg-shaped spaceship and [[Pam Dawber]] as Mindy McConnell, his human friend and roommate, and later his wife and the mother of his child.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\n{{Main|List of Mork & Mindy episodes}}\n{{:List of Mork & Mindy episodes}}\n\n===Premise and initial success===\nThe character of Mork was played by a then-unknown [[Robin Williams]], who impressed producer [[Garry Marshall]] with his quirky comedic ability as soon as they met.  Marshall was looking for an actor for an episode of ''[[Happy Days]]''. When Williams was asked to take a seat at the audition, Williams immediately sat on his head on the chair and Marshall cast him on the spot, and later wryly commented that Williams was the only alien who auditioned for the role.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robin Williams Biography|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html|publisher=Biography Channel|accessdate=27 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212135/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html|archivedate=16 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nMork appears in the ''Happy Days'' season five episode \"[[My Favorite Orkan]]\", which first aired in February 1978 and is a take on the 1960s sitcom ''[[My Favorite Martian]]''. The show wanted to feature a spaceman in order to capitalize on the popularity of the then recently released [[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sundance-2018-five-revelations-from-new-robin-williams-documentary/|title=Sundance 2018: Five Revelations From New Robin Williams Documentary|date=21 January 2018|publisher=}}</ref> Williams' character, Mork, attempts to take [[Richie Cunningham]] back to his planet of Ork as a human specimen, but his plan is foiled by [[Fonzie]]. In the initial broadcast of this episode, it all turned out to be a dream that Richie had, but when Mork proved so popular, the ending in the syndicated version was re-edited to show Mork erasing the experience from everyone's minds, thus meaning the event had actually happened and was not a dream.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n''Mork & Mindy'' is set in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]], in the then present-day late 1970s and early 1980s  (as opposed to the ''Happy Days'' setting of [[Milwaukee]] in the late-1950s). Mork explains to Richie that he is from the \"future\": the 1970s.\n\nMork arrives on Earth in an egg-shaped spacecraft. He has been assigned to observe human behavior by Orson, his mostly unseen and long-suffering superior (voiced by [[Ralph James]]). Orson has sent Mork to get him off Ork, where humor is not permitted. Attempting to fit in, Mork dresses in an Earth suit, but wears it backward. Landing in Boulder, Colorado, he encounters 21-year-old Mindy ([[Pam Dawber]]), who is upset after an argument with her boyfriend, and offers assistance. Because of his odd garb, she mistakes him for a priest and is taken in by his willingness to listen (in fact, simply observing her behavior). When Mindy notices his backward suit and unconventional behavior, she asks who he really is, and he innocently tells her the truth. She promises to keep his identity a secret and allows him to move into her attic. Mindy's father Fred ([[Conrad Janis]]) objects to his daughter living with a man (particularly one as bizarre as Mork), but Fred's mother-in-law Cora (Elizabeth Kerr) approves of Mork and the living arrangement. Mindy and Cora work at Fred's music store, where Cora gives violin lessons to Eugene ([[Jeffrey Jacquet]]), a 10-year-old boy who becomes Mork's friend. Also seen occasionally are Mindy's snooty old high school friend Susan ([[Morgan Fairchild]]) and the possibly insane Exidor ([[Robert Donner]]).\n\nStorylines usually center on Mork's attempts to understand human behavior and [[American culture]] as Mindy helps him to adjust to life on Earth. It usually ends up frustrating Mindy, as Mork can only do things according to Orkan customs. For example, lying to someone or not informing them it will rain is considered a practical joke (called \"splinking\") on Ork. At the end of each episode, Mork reports back to Orson on what he has learned about Earth. These end-of-show summaries allow Mork to humorously comment on social norms.\n\nMork's [[greeting]] is \"Na-Nu Na-Nu\" (pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|n|\u0251\u02d0|n|u\u02d0|_|\u02c8|n|\u0251\u02d0|n|u\u02d0}}) along with a hand gesture similar to [[Mr. Spock]]'s [[Vulcan salute]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' combined with a handshake. It became a popular [[catchphrase]] at the time, as did \"Shazbot\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0283|\u00e6|z|b|\u0252|t}}), an Orkan profanity that Mork uses.{{No citation needed: watching only 1 episode is enough... ALL episodes = no need for a quotation!!}} Mork says \"KO\" in place of \"OK\".\n\nThis series was Robin Williams' first major acting role and became famous for Williams' use of his manic [[Improvisational theatre#Improvisational comedy|improvisational comedic]] talent. Williams made up so many jokes during filming that were considered superior to the writing staff's contributions that eventually scripts had specific gaps where Williams was allowed to freely perform. Pam Dawber found him so funny that she had to bite her lip in many scenes to [[corpsing|avoid breaking up in laughter and ruining the take]], often a difficult task with Williams' talent.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}\n\nThe series was extremely popular in its first season. The [[Nielsen ratings]] were very high, ranking at 3, behind ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (at 1) and ''[[Three's Company]]'' (at 2), both on ABC, which was the highest-rated network in the U.S. in 1978. The show gained higher ratings than the ''Happy Days'' series that had spawned it, at 4.<ref name=\"directory\">{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim|author2=Earl Marsh |title= [[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows]] |publisher= [[Ballantine Books]] |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-345-45542-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amug.org/~scrnsrc/top_tv_shows_70s.html|title=Screen Source: Top TV Shows, 1970's|accessdate=10 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020084338/http://www.amug.org/~scrnsrc/top_tv_shows_70s.html|archivedate=20 October 2015}}</ref> However, the network management sought to improve the show in several ways. This was done in conjunction with what is known in the industry as [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogramming]], a technique in which a successful show is moved opposite a ratings hit on another network. The show was moved from Thursdays, where it outrated [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Waltons]]'', to Sundays where it replaced the canceled sci-fi series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''. The show then aired against two highly rated shows: [[NBC]]'s [[anthology series]] titled ''The Sunday Big Event'' and [[CBS]]'s revamped continuation of ''[[All in the Family]]'' titled ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]''.<ref name=\"directory\"/>\n\n===Second season===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MorkMindy.jpg|thumb|[[Robin Williams]] and [[Pam Dawber]] as Mork and Mindy]] -->\nThe second season saw an attempt to seek younger viewers and premiered a new disco arrangement of the gentle theme tune.\n\nThe characters of Fred and Cora were dropped from the regular cast. It was explained that Fred went on tour as a conductor with an orchestra, taking Cora with him. Fred and Cora made return appearances in later episodes. Recurring characters Susan and Eugene made no further appearances after season one and were never mentioned again.\n\nNew cast members were added. Among the new supporting characters were Remo and Jeanie DaVinci ([[Jay Thomas]] and [[Gina Hecht]]), a brother and sister from New York City who owned a new neighborhood deli where Mork and Mindy now spent a lot of time. Also added as regulars were their grumpy neighbor Mr. Bickley (who was seen occasionally in the first season and ironically worked as a verse writer for a greeting-card company), portrayed by [[Tom Poston]], and Nelson Flavor (Jim Staahl), Mindy's snooty cousin who ran for city council.\n\nThe show's main focus was no longer on Mork's slapstick attempts to adjust to the new world he was in, but on the relationship between Mork and Mindy on a romantic level. Also, some of the focus was on Mork trying to find a steady-paying job.\n\nBecause of the abrupt changes to the show and time slot, ratings slipped dramatically (from 3 to 27). The show was quickly moved back to its previous timeslot and efforts were made to return to the core of the series; however, ratings did not recover.\n\n===Third season===\nFor the third season, Jeanie, Remo, and Nelson were retained as regulars with Jeanie and Remo having opened a restaurant.  Nelson was no longer into politics and wore more casual clothes.\n\nMindy's father and grandmother returned to the series. The show acknowledged this attempt to restore its original premise, with the third season's hour-long opener titled \"Putting The Ork Back in Mork\".\n\nSeveral new supporting characters were added to the lineup. Joining were two children from the day-care center where Mork worked named Lola and Stephanie. Also added was Mindy's close friend Glenda Faye Comstock (Crissy Wilzak), a lovely young widow whom Nelson falls for.  Wilzak lasted one season as a regular.\n\nWhen these ideas failed to improve ratings, many wilder ideas were tried to attempt to capitalize on Williams' comedic talents. The season ended at number 49 in the ratings.\n\n===Fourth season===\nDespite the show's steady decline, ABC agreed to a fourth season of ''Mork & Mindy'', but executives wanted changes. The show began to include special guest stars this year.\n\nAt the beginning of the fourth season, Mork and Mindy got married. [[Jonathan Winters]], one of Williams' idols, was brought in as their child, Mearth. Because of the different Orkan physiology, Mork laid an egg, which grew and hatched into the much older Winters.<ref>{{cite news|title= TV Playbook: ''Let's Add a Kid!''|work= IGN|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/935/935812p1.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref> Winters had previously appeared in a season 3 episode as Dave McConnell (Mindy's uncle and Fred's brother). It had been previously explained that Orkans aged \"backwards\", thus explaining Mearth's appearance and that of his teacher, Miss Geezba (portrayed by then-11-year-old actress [[Louanne Sirota]]). After four seasons and 95 episodes, ''Mork & Mindy'' was canceled in the summer of 1982. The show ended at 60th place at season's end.\n\n==Characters==\n* Mork ([[Robin Williams]]) \u2013 An alien from the planet Ork sent to observe human behavior.

In the episode \"Mork's First Christmas\", a glimpse into why Susan is such a shallow person was shown. \n* Exidor ([[Robert Donner]]) \u2013 An odd man (with possible [[mental illness]]) who regards himself as a [[prophet]]. He often appears wearing a flowing white robe with a brown sash. He recognizes Mork as an alien, but nobody believes him. As the leader of a [[cult]] called \"The Friends of [[Venus]]\", of which he was the only member, he regularly engaged in conversations with imaginary members of his cult (such as \"Pepe\" and \"Rocco\"), but was the only person who could see them. Most times he is found yelling at his imaginary cult. He makes the comment, \"Entourages can be the pits!\" Later, since the [[Venusians]] had abandoned him, he began to worship [[O. J. Simpson|O.J. Simpson]] when Mork encountered him at the Boulder Police Station. He also had a plan to become \"Emperor of the Universe\" by becoming a rock-star; his musical instrument of choice was the [[accordion]]. Exidor appears to be something of a [[squatting|squatter]], as on at least two separate occasions he is present in homes not his own. Once Mork visited Exidor at a very nice apartment where he supposedly lived with his imaginary girlfriend and her twin sister. Another time, he is \"on vacation\" in Mindy's family home, where he apparently believed there was a beach in the living room closet. (\"Everybody out of the water! Can't you see that fin?\") He eventually got married, in a \"forest\" (Mindy's attic). Mindy thought his wife would be imaginary, but she turned out to be a real woman named Ambrosia. Exidor became highly popular with audiences and prompted wild applause from the studio audience when entering a scene.\n* Mr. Miles Sternhagen ([[Foster Brooks]]) \u2013 Mindy's boss when she gets a job at a local TV station. He is overbearing and demanding of Mindy when sober, but occasionally turns up drunk and cheerful (per Brooks' famous \"drunk\" act).\n* Glenda Faye Comstock (Crissy Wilzak) \u2013 Mindy's friend and recent widow who becomes the love interest of Nelson and was only seen in Season 3.\n* Todd Norman \"TNT\" Taylor ([[Bill Kirchenbauer]]) \u2013 An obnoxious and arrogant [[Promiscuity|womanizer]]. He later teaches Mork to drive at the FastLane Driving School.\n* Cathy McConnell ([[Shelley Fabares]]) \u2013 Fred's new younger wife and Mindy's stepmother seen in Seasons 2-4.\n* Lola and Stephanie (Amy Tenowich and Stephanie Kayano) \u2013 Two children from the daycare center Mork works at later in the series during Season 3. Lola is a young [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and Stephanie is a chubby girl who loves to eat.\n* Billy ([[Corey Feldman]]) \u2013 A daycare-center child who appeared during Season 3. He wants to be like his namesake [[Billy the Kid]]. Mork introduces him to the Orkan hero Squellman the Yellow.\n* Bebo \u2013 Mork's ball-of-fur pet who spoke Orkan gibberish and was introduced and only seen in Season 3. He was occasionally seen around the house and stood by Mork during his reports to Orson.\n* Eugene ([[Jeffrey Jacquet]]) \u2013 A ten-year-old boy who takes violin lessons from Cora and befriends Mork during his appearances in Season 1.\n* Arnold Wanker ([[Logan Ramsey]]) \u2013 The [[landlord]] of Fred and Mindy's music store during Season 1.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0651264/ |title=Mork & Mindy - To Tell the Truth |author= |work= |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> He dies in Fred's music store, but Mork (misinterpreting the comments made to his wife) brings him back to life (a \"one-in-a-billion\" chance).\n\n==Connections to other shows==\nActor-director [[Jerry Paris]] was inspired to create the character of Mork after directing an unusual and memorable episode of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' titled \"It May Look Like a Walnut\", in which [[Dick Van Dyke|Van Dyke]]'s Rob Petrie has a dream wherein he believes the Earth has been surreptitiously invaded by [[walnut]]-eating aliens who steal humans' thumbs and imaginations.<ref name=\"Weissman\">{{cite book\n | last = Weissman\n | first = Ginny\n |author2=Coyne Steven Sanders\n | title = The Dick Van Dyke Show\n | year = 1993\n | publisher = Macmillan\n | isbn = 0-312-08766-7\n | page = 60\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yw4clpRWbg4C&pg=PA60&dq=%22danny+thomas%22+walnuts+thumbs&ei=iLwdS4qSOpi0MIXZ8PEI&cd=3#v=onepage&q=%22danny%20thomas%22%20walnuts%20thumbs&f=false\n}}</ref> Series creator [[Carl Reiner]] had written the episode, which was the 20th in [[The Dick Van Dyke Show (season 2)|the show's second season]] and the 50th episode produced.

[[Fonzie]] tells him that people make up stories about [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s because their lives are \"humdrum.\" Then while Richie is at home, Mork walks in. He freezes everyone with his finger except Richie and says he was sent to Earth to find a \"humdrum\" human to take back to Ork. Richie runs to Fonzie for help. When Mork catches up to him, he freezes everyone, but finds himself unable to freeze Fonzie because of The Fonz's famous and powerful thumbs. Mork challenges Fonzie to a [[duel]]: finger vs. thumb. After their duel, The Fonz admits defeat, and Mork decides to take Fonzie back to Ork instead of Richie. Then, Richie wakes up and realizes he was dreaming. There is a knock on the door and much to Richie's dismay, it is a man who looks exactly like Mork, except in regular clothes, asking for directions.\n\nWhen production on ''Mork & Mindy'' began, an extra scene was filmed and added to this episode for subsequent [[rerun]]s. In the scene, Mork contacts Orson and explains that he decided to let Fonzie go, and was going to travel to the year 1978 to continue his mission. In the pilot episode of ''Mork & Mindy,'' Orson tells Mork that he is assigning him to study the planet Earth. Mork remembers that he has been to Earth before to collect a specimen (Fonzie) but he \"had to throw it back, though. Too small.\"\n\nFonzie and Laverne of ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' appeared in the first episode of the show. In this segment, Mork relays to Mindy his trip to 1950s Milwaukee where Fonzie sets Mork up on a date with Laverne.\n\nMork returned to ''Happy Days'' in the episode \"Mork Returns\" in which Mork tells Richie that he enjoys coming to the 1950s because life is simpler and more \"humdrum\" than in the 1970s. Fonzie sees Mork and immediately tries to run away, but Mork freezes him and makes him stay. He eventually lets him go, but not before Fonzie asks Mork to reveal two things about the future: \"cars and girls\". Mork's response is, \"In 1979... both are faster.\" The episode is mostly a [[retrospective]] in which clips are shown as Richie and Fonzie try to explain the concepts of love and friendship to Mork.\n\nMork also appears in the first episode of ''[[Out of the Blue (1979 TV series)|Out of the Blue]],'' \"Random's Arrival\", as a crossover stunt.\n\n==Home media==\n[[Paramount Home Entertainment]] has released the entire series of ''Mork & Mindy'' on DVD in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] in both individual season sets and a complete series configuration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Mork-Mindy-Season-4-and-Complete-Series/20342|title=Mork & Mindy DVD news: Announcement for The 4th Season and The Complete Series - TVShowsOnDVD.com|accessdate=10 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304214102/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Mork-Mindy-Season-4-and-Complete-Series/20342|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> while the first three seasons are available in [[DVD region code|Regions 2 and 4]].

By 1983, most stations that owned the show rested it much of the year running it only in the summer, when weaker programming tended to air. Few stations renewed the show a few years later. {{citation needed|date=April 2011}} By 1987, the show only aired in a handful of TV markets. With the expansion of cable channels available, the show began airing on cable. [[Nick at Nite]] reran the show from March 4, 1991 to November 27, 1995.<ref>Nick at Nite Log - 1985-present</ref> The show has also aired on [[FOX Family Channel]] in the late 1990s.

This was also used in the show as Mindy's actual address in Boulder, as shown in the episode \"Mork Goes Public\". The same house was later used for exterior shots on the series ''[[Perfect Strangers (U.S. TV series)|Perfect Strangers]]'' in Episode 21 of Season 5, \"This Old House\", where the show's main characters, cousins Larry and Balki, remodel a home for a fix-and-flip in hopes of huge profits. Often mistaken, it was not the house the cousins moved into with their wives during the final two seasons.

Several British-produced [[Yearbook|annuals]] were also released that tied in with the series.\n* A subsequent [[animated series]] titled ''[[Mork & Mindy/Laverne & Shirley/Fonz Hour]]'' ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1982 to 1983. The ''[[Mork & Mindy/Laverne & Shirley/Fonz Hour#Mork & Mindy|Mork & Mindy]]'' segments were a [[prequel]] with Mindy as a student in high school.

A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] after a highly successful episode of ''[[Happy Days]]'', it starred [[Robin Williams]] as Mork, an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] who comes to Earth from the planet Ork in a small, one-Orkan egg-shaped spaceship and [[Pam Dawber]] as Mindy McConnell, his human friend and roommate, and later his wife and the mother of his child.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\n{{Main|List of Mork & Mindy episodes}}\n{{:List of Mork & Mindy episodes}}\n\n===Premise and initial success===\nThe character of Mork was played by a then-unknown [[Robin Williams]], who impressed producer [[Garry Marshall]] with his quirky comedic ability as soon as they met.  Marshall was looking for an actor for an episode of ''[[Happy Days]]''. When Williams was asked to take a seat at the audition, Williams immediately sat on his head on the chair and Marshall cast him on the spot, and later wryly commented that Williams was the only alien who auditioned for the role.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robin Williams Biography|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html|publisher=Biography Channel|accessdate=27 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212135/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html|archivedate=16 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nMork appears in the ''Happy Days'' season five episode \"[[My Favorite Orkan]]\", which first aired in February 1978 and is a take on the 1960s sitcom ''[[My Favorite Martian]]''. The show wanted to feature a spaceman in order to capitalize on the popularity of the then recently released [[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sundance-2018-five-revelations-from-new-robin-williams-documentary/|title=Sundance 2018: Five Revelations From New Robin Williams Documentary|date=21 January 2018|publisher=}}</ref> Williams' character, Mork, attempts to take [[Richie Cunningham]] back to his planet of Ork as a human specimen, but his plan is foiled by [[Fonzie]]. In the initial broadcast of this episode, it all turned out to be a dream that Richie had, but when Mork proved so popular, the ending in the syndicated version was re-edited to show Mork erasing the experience from everyone's minds, thus meaning the event had actually happened and was not a dream.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n''Mork & Mindy'' is set in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]], in the then present-day late 1970s and early 1980s  (as opposed to the ''Happy Days'' setting of [[Milwaukee]] in the late-1950s). Mork explains to Richie that he is from the \"future\": the 1970s.\n\nMork arrives on Earth in an egg-shaped spacecraft. He has been assigned to observe human behavior by Orson, his mostly unseen and long-suffering superior (voiced by [[Ralph James]]). Orson has sent Mork to get him off Ork, where humor is not permitted. Attempting to fit in, Mork dresses in an Earth suit, but wears it backward. Landing in Boulder, Colorado, he encounters 21-year-old Mindy ([[Pam Dawber]]), who is upset after an argument with her boyfriend, and offers assistance. Because of his odd garb, she mistakes him for a priest and is taken in by his willingness to listen (in fact, simply observing her behavior). When Mindy notices his backward suit and unconventional behavior, she asks who he really is, and he innocently tells her the truth. She promises to keep his identity a secret and allows him to move into her attic. Mindy's father Fred ([[Conrad Janis]]) objects to his daughter living with a man (particularly one as bizarre as Mork), but Fred's mother-in-law Cora (Elizabeth Kerr) approves of Mork and the living arrangement. Mindy and Cora work at Fred's music store, where Cora gives violin lessons to Eugene ([[Jeffrey Jacquet]]), a 10-year-old boy who becomes Mork's friend. Also seen occasionally are Mindy's snooty old high school friend Susan ([[Morgan Fairchild]]) and the possibly insane Exidor ([[Robert Donner]]).\n\nStorylines usually center on Mork's attempts to understand human behavior and [[American culture]] as Mindy helps him to adjust to life on Earth. It usually ends up frustrating Mindy, as Mork can only do things according to Orkan customs. For example, lying to someone or not informing them it will rain is considered a practical joke (called \"splinking\") on Ork. At the end of each episode, Mork reports back to Orson on what he has learned about Earth. These end-of-show summaries allow Mork to humorously comment on social norms.\n\nMork's [[greeting]] is \"Na-Nu Na-Nu\" (pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|n|\u0251\u02d0|n|u\u02d0|_|\u02c8|n|\u0251\u02d0|n|u\u02d0}}) along with a hand gesture similar to [[Mr. Spock]]'s [[Vulcan salute]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' combined with a handshake. It became a popular [[catchphrase]] at the time, as did \"Shazbot\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0283|\u00e6|z|b|\u0252|t}}), an Orkan profanity that Mork uses.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}} Mork says \"KO\" in place of \"OK\".\n\nThis series was Robin Williams' first major acting role and became famous for Williams' use of his manic [[Improvisational theatre#Improvisational comedy|improvisational comedic]] talent. Williams made up so many jokes during filming that were considered superior to the writing staff's contributions that eventually scripts had specific gaps where Williams was allowed to freely perform. Pam Dawber found him so funny that she had to bite her lip in many scenes to [[corpsing|avoid breaking up in laughter and ruining the take]], often a difficult task with Williams' talent.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}\n\nThe series was extremely popular in its first season. The [[Nielsen ratings]] were very high, ranking at 3, behind ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (at 1) and ''[[Three's Company]]'' (at 2), both on ABC, which was the highest-rated network in the U.S. in 1978. The show gained higher ratings than the ''Happy Days'' series that had spawned it, at 4.<ref name=\"directory\">{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim|author2=Earl Marsh |title= [[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows]] |publisher= [[Ballantine Books]] |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-345-45542-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amug.org/~scrnsrc/top_tv_shows_70s.html|title=Screen Source: Top TV Shows, 1970's|accessdate=10 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020084338/http://www.amug.org/~scrnsrc/top_tv_shows_70s.html|archivedate=20 October 2015}}</ref> However, the network management sought to improve the show in several ways. This was done in conjunction with what is known in the industry as [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogramming]], a technique in which a successful show is moved opposite a ratings hit on another network. The show was moved from Thursdays, where it outrated [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Waltons]]'', to Sundays where it replaced the canceled sci-fi series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''. The show then aired against two highly rated shows: [[NBC]]'s [[anthology series]] titled ''The Sunday Big Event'' and [[CBS]]'s revamped continuation of ''[[All in the Family]]'' titled ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]''.<ref name=\"directory\"/>\n\n===Second season===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MorkMindy.jpg|thumb|[[Robin Williams]] and [[Pam Dawber]] as Mork and Mindy]] -->\nThe second season saw an attempt to seek younger viewers and premiered a new disco arrangement of the gentle theme tune.\n\nThe characters of Fred and Cora were dropped from the regular cast. It was explained that Fred went on tour as a conductor with an orchestra, taking Cora with him. Fred and Cora made return appearances in later episodes. Recurring characters Susan and Eugene made no further appearances after season one and were never mentioned again.\n\nNew cast members were added. Among the new supporting characters were Remo and Jeanie DaVinci ([[Jay Thomas]] and [[Gina Hecht]]), a brother and sister from New York City who owned a new neighborhood deli where Mork and Mindy now spent a lot of time. Also added as regulars were their grumpy neighbor Mr. Bickley (who was seen occasionally in the first season and ironically worked as a verse writer for a greeting-card company), portrayed by [[Tom Poston]], and Nelson Flavor (Jim Staahl), Mindy's snooty cousin who ran for city council.\n\nThe show's main focus was no longer on Mork's slapstick attempts to adjust to the new world he was in, but on the relationship between Mork and Mindy on a romantic level. Also, some of the focus was on Mork trying to find a steady-paying job.\n\nBecause of the abrupt changes to the show and time slot, ratings slipped dramatically (from 3 to 27). The show was quickly moved back to its previous timeslot and efforts were made to return to the core of the series; however, ratings did not recover.\n\n===Third season===\nFor the third season, Jeanie, Remo, and Nelson were retained as regulars with Jeanie and Remo having opened a restaurant.  Nelson was no longer into politics and wore more casual clothes.\n\nMindy's father and grandmother returned to the series. The show acknowledged this attempt to restore its original premise, with the third season's hour-long opener titled \"Putting The Ork Back in Mork\".\n\nSeveral new supporting characters were added to the lineup. Joining were two children from the day-care center where Mork worked named Lola and Stephanie. Also added was Mindy's close friend Glenda Faye Comstock (Crissy Wilzak), a lovely young widow whom Nelson falls for.  Wilzak lasted one season as a regular.\n\nWhen these ideas failed to improve ratings, many wilder ideas were tried to attempt to capitalize on Williams' comedic talents. The season ended at number 49 in the ratings.\n\n===Fourth season===\nDespite the show's steady decline, ABC agreed to a fourth season of ''Mork & Mindy'', but executives wanted changes. The show began to include special guest stars this year.\n\nAt the beginning of the fourth season, Mork and Mindy got married. [[Jonathan Winters]], one of Williams' idols, was brought in as their child, Mearth. Because of the different Orkan physiology, Mork laid an egg, which grew and hatched into the much older Winters.<ref>{{cite news|title= TV Playbook: ''Let's Add a Kid!''|work= IGN|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/935/935812p1.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref> Winters had previously appeared in a season 3 episode as Dave McConnell (Mindy's uncle and Fred's brother). It had been previously explained that Orkans aged \"backwards\", thus explaining Mearth's appearance and that of his teacher, Miss Geezba (portrayed by then-11-year-old actress [[Louanne Sirota]]). After four seasons and 95 episodes, ''Mork & Mindy'' was canceled in the summer of 1982. The show ended at 60th place at season's end.\n\n==Characters==\n* Mork ([[Robin Williams]]) \u2013 An alien from the planet Ork sent to observe human behavior. Mork mentions many times that Orkan scientists grew him in a test-tube.\n* Mindy McConnell ([[Pam Dawber]]) \u2013 A pretty female human who finds Mork and teaches him about human behavior. Eventually falls in love, marries Mork and raises an Orkan \"child\".\n* Fred McConnell ([[Conrad Janis]]) \u2013 Mindy's father, a widower with conservative values. In the first season, Fred owned a music shop with Cora. In the third season, Fred became the conductor of the Boulder Symphony Orchestra.\n* Grandma Cora Hudson<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077053/fullcredits#cast |title=Full cast and crew for \"Mork & Mindy\"}}</ref> (Elizabeth Kerr) \u2013 Mindy's less-conservative, progressive grandmother and Fred's mother-in-law.\n* Franklin Delano Bickley ([[Tom Poston]]) \u2013 Mindy's downstairs neighbor. He has a job involving writing out [[greeting card]]s.  At first, he is a total grump and always complains about noise.  In time, however, he warms up and becomes a friend to Mork and Mindy and the gang.\n* Mearth ([[Jonathan Winters]]) \u2013 The \"child\" of Mork and Mindy and godson of Orson. Because of Orkan physiology, Orkans age backwards, starting with elderly adult bodies but with the mind of a child and regressing to feeble \"old\" kids.\n* Remo DaVinci ([[Jay Thomas]]) \u2013 The brother of Jeanie DaVinci co-owner of The New York Delicatessen in season 2 and DaVinci's Restaurant in season 3.\n* Jeanie DaVinci ([[Gina Hecht]]) \u2013 The sister of Remo DaVinci and co-owner of The New York Delicatessen in season 2 and DaVinci's Restaurant in season 3.\n* Nelson Flavor (Jim Staahl) \u2013 The strait-laced, driven, yet aloof cousin of Mindy with dreams of political power.\n* Orson (voiced by [[Ralph James]]) \u2013 Mork's mostly unseen and long-suffering superior who has sent Mork to Earth to get him off-world because humor is not permitted on Ork.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* Susan Taylor ([[Morgan Fairchild]]) \u2013 Mindy's snooty ex-friend from high school who was only seen in Season 1. In the episode \"Mork's First Christmas\", a glimpse into why Susan is such a shallow person was shown. \n* Exidor ([[Robert Donner]]) \u2013 An odd man (with possible [[mental illness]]) who regards himself as a [[prophet]]. He often appears wearing a flowing white robe with a brown sash. He recognizes Mork as an alien, but nobody believes him. As the leader of a [[cult]] called \"The Friends of [[Venus]]\", of which he was the only member, he regularly engaged in conversations with imaginary members of his cult (such as \"Pepe\" and \"Rocco\"), but was the only person who could see them. Most times he is found yelling at his imaginary cult. He makes the comment, \"Entourages can be the pits!\" Later, since the [[Venusians]] had abandoned him, he began to worship [[O. J. Simpson|O.J. Simpson]] when Mork encountered him at the Boulder Police Station. He also had a plan to become \"Emperor of the Universe\" by becoming a rock-star; his musical instrument of choice was the [[accordion]]. Exidor appears to be something of a [[squatting|squatter]], as on at least two separate occasions he is present in homes not his own. Once Mork visited Exidor at a very nice apartment where he supposedly lived with his imaginary girlfriend and her twin sister. Another time, he is \"on vacation\" in Mindy's family home, where he apparently believed there was a beach in the living room closet. (\"Everybody out of the water! Can't you see that fin?\") He eventually got married, in a \"forest\" (Mindy's attic). Mindy thought his wife would be imaginary, but she turned out to be a real woman named Ambrosia. Exidor became highly popular with audiences and prompted wild applause from the studio audience when entering a scene.\n* Mr. Miles Sternhagen ([[Foster Brooks]]) \u2013 Mindy's boss when she gets a job at a local TV station. He is overbearing and demanding of Mindy when sober, but occasionally turns up drunk and cheerful (per Brooks' famous \"drunk\" act).\n* Glenda Faye Comstock (Crissy Wilzak) \u2013 Mindy's friend and recent widow who becomes the love interest of Nelson and was only seen in Season 3.\n* Todd Norman \"TNT\" Taylor ([[Bill Kirchenbauer]]) \u2013 An obnoxious and arrogant [[Promiscuity|womanizer]]. He later teaches Mork to drive at the FastLane Driving School.\n* Cathy McConnell ([[Shelley Fabares]]) \u2013 Fred's new younger wife and Mindy's stepmother seen in Seasons 2-4.\n* Lola and Stephanie (Amy Tenowich and Stephanie Kayano) \u2013 Two children from the daycare center Mork works at later in the series during Season 3. Lola is a young [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and Stephanie is a chubby girl who loves to eat.\n* Billy ([[Corey Feldman]]) \u2013 A daycare-center child who appeared during Season 3. He wants to be like his namesake [[Billy the Kid]]. Mork introduces him to the Orkan hero Squellman the Yellow.\n* Bebo \u2013 Mork's ball-of-fur pet who spoke Orkan gibberish and was introduced and only seen in Season 3. He was occasionally seen around the house and stood by Mork during his reports to Orson.\n* Eugene ([[Jeffrey Jacquet]]) \u2013 A ten-year-old boy who takes violin lessons from Cora and befriends Mork during his appearances in Season 1.\n* Arnold Wanker ([[Logan Ramsey]]) \u2013 The [[landlord]] of Fred and Mindy's music store during Season 1.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0651264/ |title=Mork & Mindy - To Tell the Truth |author= |work= |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> He dies in Fred's music store, but Mork (misinterpreting the comments made to his wife) brings him back to life (a \"one-in-a-billion\" chance).\n\n==Connections to other shows==\nActor-director [[Jerry Paris]] was inspired to create the character of Mork after directing an unusual and memorable episode of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' titled \"It May Look Like a Walnut\", in which [[Dick Van Dyke|Van Dyke]]'s Rob Petrie has a dream wherein he believes the Earth has been surreptitiously invaded by [[walnut]]-eating aliens who steal humans' thumbs and imaginations.<ref name=\"Weissman\">{{cite book\n | last = Weissman\n | first = Ginny\n |author2=Coyne Steven Sanders\n | title = The Dick Van Dyke Show\n | year = 1993\n | publisher = Macmillan\n | isbn = 0-312-08766-7\n | page = 60\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yw4clpRWbg4C&pg=PA60&dq=%22danny+thomas%22+walnuts+thumbs&ei=iLwdS4qSOpi0MIXZ8PEI&cd=3#v=onepage&q=%22danny%20thomas%22%20walnuts%20thumbs&f=false\n}}</ref> Series creator [[Carl Reiner]] had written the episode, which was the 20th in [[The Dick Van Dyke Show (season 2)|the show's second season]] and the 50th episode produced.

[[Fonzie]] tells him that people make up stories about [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s because their lives are \"humdrum.\" Then while Richie is at home, Mork walks in. He freezes everyone with his finger except Richie and says he was sent to Earth to find a \"humdrum\" human to take back to Ork. Richie runs to Fonzie for help. When Mork catches up to him, he freezes everyone, but finds himself unable to freeze Fonzie because of The Fonz's famous and powerful thumbs. Mork challenges Fonzie to a [[duel]]: finger vs. thumb. After their duel, The Fonz admits defeat, and Mork decides to take Fonzie back to Ork instead of Richie. Then, Richie wakes up and realizes he was dreaming. There is a knock on the door and much to Richie's dismay, it is a man who looks exactly like Mork, except in regular clothes, asking for directions.\n\nWhen production on ''Mork & Mindy'' began, an extra scene was filmed and added to this episode for subsequent [[rerun]]s. In the scene, Mork contacts Orson and explains that he decided to let Fonzie go, and was going to travel to the year 1978 to continue his mission. In the pilot episode of ''Mork & Mindy,'' Orson tells Mork that he is assigning him to study the planet Earth. Mork remembers that he has been to Earth before to collect a specimen (Fonzie) but he \"had to throw it back, though. Too small.\"\n\nFonzie and Laverne of ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' appeared in the first episode of the show. In this segment, Mork relays to Mindy his trip to 1950s Milwaukee where Fonzie sets Mork up on a date with Laverne.\n\nMork returned to ''Happy Days'' in the episode \"Mork Returns\" in which Mork tells Richie that he enjoys coming to the 1950s because life is simpler and more \"humdrum\" than in the 1970s. Fonzie sees Mork and immediately tries to run away, but Mork freezes him and makes him stay. He eventually lets him go, but not before Fonzie asks Mork to reveal two things about the future: \"cars and girls\". Mork's response is, \"In 1979... both are faster.\" The episode is mostly a [[retrospective]] in which clips are shown as Richie and Fonzie try to explain the concepts of love and friendship to Mork.\n\nMork also appears in the first episode of ''[[Out of the Blue (1979 TV series)|Out of the Blue]],'' \"Random's Arrival\", as a crossover stunt.\n\n==Home media==\n[[Paramount Home Entertainment]] has released the entire series of ''Mork & Mindy'' on DVD in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] in both individual season sets and a complete series configuration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Mork-Mindy-Season-4-and-Complete-Series/20342|title=Mork & Mindy DVD news: Announcement for The 4th Season and The Complete Series - TVShowsOnDVD.com|accessdate=10 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304214102/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Mork-Mindy-Season-4-and-Complete-Series/20342|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> while the first three seasons are available in [[DVD region code|Regions 2 and 4]].

The program lost to ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'' and Williams lost to [[Carroll O'Connor]] for ''[[All in the Family]]''.\n\n==Syndication==\n''Mork & Mindy'' was syndicated off network by Paramount beginning in the Fall of 1982, to low ratings. By 1983, most stations that owned the show rested it much of the year running it only in the summer, when weaker programming tended to air. Few stations renewed the show a few years later. {{citation needed|date=April 2011}} By 1987, the show only aired in a handful of TV markets. With the expansion of cable channels available, the show began airing on cable. [[Nick at Nite]] reran the show from March 4, 1991 to November 27, 1995.<ref>Nick at Nite Log - 1985-present</ref> The show has also aired on [[FOX Family Channel]] in the late 1990s. From 2008 to 2011, the show aired in marathons on [[SyFy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mork And Mindy finally being used on SyFy|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/02/mork-mindy-finally-being-used-on-syfy.html?m=1|website=Sitcoms Online|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref> It has aired in subsequent years on [[Me-TV]], the [[Discovery Family|Hub Network]] and various other classic television stations airing on various [[digital subchannels]]. The show currently airs on [[Antenna TV]].\n\n==Filming locations==\n[[File:1619 Pine St, Boulder, Colorado.jpg|thumb|1619 Pine Street, [[Boulder, Colorado]], the location used for the external shots of Mindy's house on ''Mork & Mindy'']]\nIn an interview with [[Garry Marshall]] on June 30, 2006, [[Pat O'Brien (television)|Pat O'Brien]] mentioned that ''Mork & Mindy'' was filmed on [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] stage 27, the former studio for his [[infotainment]] program ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]''.\n\nThe house from the show is located at 1619 Pine Street, just a few blocks away from the [[Pearl Street Mall]] in Boulder. This was also used in the show as Mindy's actual address in Boulder, as shown in the episode \"Mork Goes Public\". The same house was later used for exterior shots on the series ''[[Perfect Strangers (U.S. TV series)|Perfect Strangers]]'' in Episode 21 of Season 5, \"This Old House\", where the show's main characters, cousins Larry and Balki, remodel a home for a fix-and-flip in hopes of huge profits. Often mistaken, it was not the house the cousins moved into with their wives during the final two seasons. In addition, it was used in three episodes of ''[[Family Matters]]'' as Myra's house.<ref>\"We're Going to Disney World (Part 2)\", \"Crazy For You (Part 1)\", and \"Crazier for You (Part 2)\"</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}{{original research inline|date=April 2012}} {{As of|2016|07}}, the house was valued at $1.9 million, with a last sale date of 1974 for US $80,000 ({{Inflation|US|80000|1974|2019|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1619-Pine-St-Boulder-CO-80302/13177031_zpid/ |title=1619 Pine St, Boulder, CO 80302 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=zillow.com |access-date=4 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Spin-offs and adaptations==\n* In the United Kingdom, a long-running [[comic strip]] version was written by [[Angus P. Allan]], illustrated by Bill Titcombe, and printed in children's television magazine, ''[[Look-In]]''. Several British-produced [[Yearbook|annuals]] were also released that tied in with the series.\n* A subsequent [[animated series]] titled ''[[Mork & Mindy/Laverne & Shirley/Fonz Hour]]'' ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1982 to 1983. The ''[[Mork & Mindy/Laverne & Shirley/Fonz Hour#Mork & Mindy|Mork & Mindy]]'' segments were a [[prequel]] with Mindy as a student in high school. The character of Eugene returned in this spin-off voiced by [[Shavar Ross]].\n* In 2005, a [[Television movie|made-for-television movie]] titled ''Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Mork & Mindy'' aired on [[NBC]]. [[Chris Diamantopoulos]] portrayed Robin Williams, [[Erinn Hayes]] portrayed Pam Dawber and [[Daniel Roebuck]] portrayed producer [[Garry Marshall]]. The movie depicts Williams' instant stardom and behind the scenes turmoil that the cast and crew would have with the network.\n* In 1979, a short-lived Brazilian version of the series appeared as ''Superbronco''.
