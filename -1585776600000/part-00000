The old Armenian town of [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]] in the province of [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]] was taken early in the invasion. From there Abbas' army fanned out across the Araratian plain. The Shah pursued a careful strategy, advancing and retreating as the occasion demanded, determined not to risk his enterprise in a direct confrontation with stronger enemy forces.\n\nWhile laying siege to [[Kars]], he learned of the approach of a large Ottoman army, commanded by Djghazad\u00e9 [[Sinan Pasha]]. The order to withdraw was given; but to deny the enemy the potential to resupply themselves from the land, he ordered the wholesale destruction of the Armenian towns and farms on the plain. As part of this the whole population was ordered to accompany the Persian army in its withdrawal. Some 300,000 people were duly herded to the banks of the [[Araxes River]]. Those who attempted to resist the mass deportation were killed outright. The Shah had previously ordered the destruction of the only bridge, so people were forced into the waters, where a great many drowned, carried away by the currents, before reaching the opposite bank. This was only the beginning of their ordeal. One eye-witness, Father de Guyan, describes the predicament of the refugees thus:\n\n:''It was not only the winter cold that was causing torture and death to the deportees. The greatest suffering came from hunger. The provisions which the deportees had brought with them were soon consumed&nbsp;... The children were crying for food or milk, none of which existed, because the women's breasts had dried up from hunger&nbsp;... Many women, hungry and exhausted, would leave their famished children on the roadside, and continue their tortuous journey. Some would go to nearby forests in search of something to eat. Usually they would not come back. Often those who died, served as food for the living.''\n\nUnable to maintain his army on the desolate plain, Sinan Pasha was forced to winter in [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. Armies sent in pursuit of the Shah in 1605 were defeated, and by 1606 Abbas had regained all of the territory lost to the Turks earlier in his reign. The scorched-earth tactic had worked, though at a terrible cost to the Armenian people. Of the 300,000 deported it is calculated that less than half survived the march to [[Isfahan]].

Examples include: the [[Khanate of Erevan]], [[Khanate of Nakhichevan]] and the [[Karabakh Khanate]].\n\nEven though [[Western Armenia]] had already once been conquered by the Ottomans following the Peace of Amasya, Greater Armenia was eventually decisively divided between the vying rivals, the Ottomans and the Safavids, in the first half of the 17th century following the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1623\u201339)]] and the resulting [[Treaty of Zuhab]] under which [[Eastern Armenia]] remained under Persian rule, and [[Western Armenia]] remained under Ottoman rule.<ref name=\"eastern\" />\n\nPersia continued to rule [[Eastern Armenia]], which included all of the modern-day Armenian Republic, until the first half of the 19th century. By the late 18th century, Imperial Russia had started to encroach to the south into the land of its neighbours; [[Qajar Iran]] and [[Ottoman Turkey]]. In 1804, [[Pavel Tsitsianov]] [[Battle of Ganja (1804)|invaded]] the Iranian town of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] and massacred many of its inhabitants while making the rest flee deeper within the borders of Qajar Iran. This was a declaration of war and regarded as an invasion of Iranian territory.{{sfn|Fisher|1991|p=332}} It was the beginning of the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]]. The following years were devastating for the Iranian towns in the Caucasus as well as the inhabitants of the region, as well as for the Persian army. The war eventually ended in 1813 with a Russian victory after their successful [[storming of Lankaran]] in early 1813. The [[Treaty of Gulistan]] that was signed in the same year forced Qajar Iran to irrevocably cede significant amounts of its [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] territories to Russia, comprising modern-day [[Dagestan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and most of what is today the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].<ref>Timothy C.

However, this war ended even more disastrously, as the Russians not only occupied as far as [[Tabriz]], the ensuing treaty that followed, namely the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] of 1828, forced it to irrevocably cede its last remaining territories in the [[Caucasus]], comprising all of modern-day [[Armenia]], [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] and [[Igdir Province|Igdir]].<ref>Timothy C.

Mehmed and his successors used the religious systems of their subject nationalities as a method of population control, and so Ottoman Sultans invited an Armenian archbishop to establish the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The Armenians of Constantinople grew in numbers, and became respected, if not full, members of Ottoman society.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire ruled in accordance to [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. As such, the [[People of the Book]] (the [[Christianity|Christians]] and the [[Judaism|Jews]]) had to pay an extra tax to fulfil their status as [[dhimmi]] and in return were guaranteed religious autonomy. While the [[Armenians]] of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] benefited from the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]]'s support and grew to be a prospering community, the same could not be said about the ones inhabiting [[Armenian Highland|historic Armenia]].\n\nDuring times of crisis the ones in the remote regions of mountainous [[eastern Anatolia]] were mistreated by local [[Kurds|Kurdish]] chiefs and feudal lords.

The national liberation movement of the [[History of the Balkans#National Awakening in the Balkans|Balkan peoples]] and the immediate involvement of the European powers in the Eastern question had a powerful effect on the development of the national liberation ideology movement among the [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians of the Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Arman J.

Those Armenians who did not support national liberation aspirations or who were neutral were called ''chezoks''. In 1839, the situation of the Ottoman Armenians slightly improved after [[Abdul Mejid I]] carried out [[Tanzimat]] reforms in its territories. However, later Sultans, such as [[Abdul Hamid II]] stopped the reforms and carried out massacres, now known as the [[Hamidian massacres]] of 1895\u201396 leading to a failed Armenian attempt to [[Y\u0131ld\u0131z assassination attempt|assassinate]] him.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==20th century==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n\n===The Armenian Genocide (1915\u20131921) and First World War===\n{{Main|Armenian Genocide|Caucasus Campaign}}\n[[File:Marcharmenians.jpg|thumb|Armenian civilians, being deported during the [[Armenian Genocide]].]]\n[[File:Armenia between russian and ottoman empires.png|thumb|6 Armenian provinces of [[Western Armenia]] and boundaries between countries before [[World War I]].]]\nIn 1915, the Ottoman Empire systematically carried out the [[Armenian Genocide]].

Competing national interests and war with [[Turkey]] led to the dissolution of the republic half a year later, in April 1918.\n\nAfter the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the takeover of the [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Stepan Shaumyan]] was placed in charge of Russian Armenia. In September 1917, the convention in Tiflis elected the [[Armenian National Council of Tiflis|Armenian National Council]], the first sovereign political body of Armenians since the collapse of Lesser Armenia in 1375. Meanwhile, both the Ittihad (Unionist) and the Nationalists moved to win the friendship of the Bolsheviks.\n\n[[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal (Atat\u00fcrk)]] sent several delegations to Moscow in an attempt to win some support for his own post-Ottoman movement in what he saw as a modernised ethno-nationalist Turkey. This alliance proved disastrous for the Armenians. The signing of the Ottoman-Russian friendship treaty (1 January 1918), helped [[Vehib Pasha]] to attack the new Republic. Under heavy pressure from the combined forces of the Ottoman army and the Kurdish irregulars, the Republic was forced to withdraw from Erzincan to Erzurum. In the end, the Republic had to evacuate Erzurum as well.\n\nFurther southeast, in Van, the Armenians resisted the Turkish army until April 1918, but eventually were forced to evacuate it and withdraw to Persia. Conditions deteriorated when Azerbaijani Tatars sided with the Turks and seized the Armenian's lines of communication, thus cutting off the Armenian National Councils in Baku and Yerevan from the National Council in Tiflis.

The Georgians offered a quadripartite conference comprising Georgia, Armenia, [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]], and the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]] in order to resolve the issue.  The Armenians rejected this proposal. In December 1918, the Georgians were confronting a rebellion chiefly in the village of [[Odzun|Uzunlar]] in the Lori region.

At that point what was left of Armenia was under the influence of the [[Bolsheviks]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAlthough the Bolsheviks succeeded in ousting the Turks from their positions in Armenia, they decided to establish peace with Turkey. In 1921, the Bolsheviks and the Turks signed the [[Treaty of Kars]], in which Turkey ceded [[Adjara]] to the USSR in exchange for the Kars territory (today the Turkish provinces of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[I\u011fd\u0131r Province|Surmalu]], and [[Ardahan Province|Ardahan]]). The land given to Turkey included the ancient city of [[Ani]] and [[Mount Ararat]], the spiritual Armenian homeland. In 1922, the newly proclaimed [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], under the leadership of [[Aleksandr Myasnikyan|Alexander Miasnikyan]], became part of the [[Soviet Union]] as one of three republics comprising the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Armenia in the Soviet Union (1922\u20131991)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n{{Main|Armenian SSR}}\n[[File:Emblem of the Armenian SSR.svg|thumb|The coat of arms of [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]] depicting [[Mount Ararat]] in the center.]]\nThe Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved in 1936 and as a result Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union as the [[Armenian SSR|Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The transition to [[communism]] was difficult for Armenia, and for most of the other republics in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities placed Armenians under strict surveillance. There was almost no [[freedom of speech]], even less so under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Any individual who was suspected of using or introducing [[nationalist]] [[rhetoric]] or elements in their works were labelled traitors or propangandists, and were sent to [[Siberia]] during Stalinist rule. Even [[Zabel Yesayan|Zabel Yessayan]], a writer who was fortunate enough to escape from ethnic cleansing during the [[Armenian Genocide]], was quickly exiled to Siberia after returning to Armenia from [[France]].\n\nSoviet Armenia participated in [[World War II]] by sending hundreds of thousands of soldiers to the front line in order to defend the \"Soviet motherland.\" Soviet rule had some positive aspects. Armenia benefited from the Soviet economy, especially when it was at its apex. Provincial villages gradually became towns and towns gradually became cities. Peace between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] was reached, albeit temporarily. During this time, Armenia had a sizeable Azeri minority, mostly centred in [[Yerevan]]. Likewise, Azerbaijan had an Armenian minority, concentrated in [[Baku]] and [[Kirovabad]].\n\nMany Armenians still had nationalist sentiments, even though they were discouraged from expressing them publicly. On 24 April 1965, tens of thousands of Armenians flooded the streets of Yerevan to remind the world of the horrors that their parents and grandparents endured during the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915. This was the first public demonstration of such high numbers in the [[USSR]], which defended national interests rather than collective ones. In the late 1980s, Armenia was suffering from pollution. With [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s introduction of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]], public demonstrations became more common. Thousands of Armenians demonstrated in Yerevan because of the USSR's inability to address simple ecological concerns. Later on, with the conflict in [[Karabakh]], the demonstrations obtained a more nationalistic flavour. Many Armenians began to demand statehood.\n\nIn 1988, the [[Spitak earthquake]] killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed multiple towns in northern Armenia, such as [[Gyumri|Leninakan]] (modern-day [[Gyumri]]) and [[Spitak]]. Many families were left without electricity and running water. The harsh situation caused by the earthquake and subsequent events made many residents of Armenia leave and settle in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]] or [[Australia]].\n\nOn 20 February 1988, interethnic fighting between the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijanis broke out shortly after the parliament of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], an autonomous oblast in Azerbaijan, voted to unify the region with Armenia. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Nagorno-Karabakh war]] pitted Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, backed by Armenia, against the [[Army of Azerbaijan]].\n\n==Independent Armenia (1991-today)==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:DistributionOfArmeniansInTheCaucasus.png|thumb|Distribution of Armenians in the Caucasus]]\n[[Armenia]] declared its sovereignty from the [[Soviet Union]] on 23 August 1991. In the wake of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]], a [[referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. Following an overwhelming vote in favour, full independence was declared on 21 September 1991. However, widespread recognition did not occur until the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union on 25 December 1991.\n\nArmenia faced many challenges during its first years as a [[sovereign state]]. Several Armenian organizations from around the world quickly arrived to offer aid and to participate in the country's early years.  From Canada, a group of young students and volunteers under the [[CYMA - Canadian Youth Mission to Armenia]] banner arrived in Ararat Region and became the first youth organization to contribute to the newly independent Republic.\n\nFollowing the Armenian victory in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]], both [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Turkey]] closed their borders and imposed a blockade which they retain to this day, severely affecting the economy of the fledgling republic. In October 2009 Turkey and Armenia signed a treaty to normalize relations.<!--status post-treaty?? -->\n\n===Ter-Petrosyan Presidency (1991\u20131998)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Film Matyan ankakhutyan.jpg|thumb|Inauguration of [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]] as president in 1991]]\n[[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]] was popularly elected the first President of the newly independent Republic of Armenia on 16 October 1991 and re-elected on 22 September 1996. His re-election was marred by allegations of electoral fraud reported by the opposition and supported by many international observers. His popularity waned further as the opposition started blaming him for the economic quagmire that Armenia's post-Soviet economy was in. He was also unpopular with one party in particular, the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], which he banned and jailed on the grounds that the party had a foreign-based leadership\u2014something which was forbidden according to the Armenian Constitution.\n\nTer-Petrosyan was forced to step down in February 1998 after advocating compromised settlement of the conflict over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] which many Armenians regarded as undermining their security. Ter-Petrosyan's key ministers, led by then-Prime Minister [[Robert Kocharyan]], refused to accept a peace plan for Karabakh put forward by international mediators in September 1997. The plan, accepted by Ter-Petrosyan and [[Azerbaijan]], called for a \"phased\" settlement of the conflict which would postpone an agreement on Karabakh's status, the main stumbling block. That agreement was to accompany the return of most Armenian-controlled Azerbaijani territories around Karabakh and the lifting of the [[Azerbaijan]]i and [[Turkey|Turkish]] blockades of Armenia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n===Kocharyan Presidency (1998\u20132008)===\n[[File:Robert Kocharyan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Kocharyan]]]]\nAfter the resignation of his predecessor [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]], [[Robert Kocharyan]] was elected Armenia's second President on 30 March 1998, defeating his main rival, [[Karen Demirchyan]], in an [[Armenian presidential election, 1998|early presidential election marred by irregularities and violations]] by both sides as reported by international electoral observers.

Artaxias took lands from the Medes, Iberians, and Syrians. He then had confrontations with [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], Seleucid Syria and Cappadocia, and was included in the treaty which followed the victory of a group of Anatolian kings over Pharnaces of Pontus in 181 BC.

Nevertheless, Greater Armenia was annexed in the early 16th century by Shah [[Ismail I]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxQpmg_JIpwC|title=Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia|access-date=15 December 2014|isbn=9781780230702|last1=Rayfield|first1=Donald|date=15 February 2013}}</ref> Following the [[Peace of Amasya]] of 1555, [[Western Armenia]] fell into the neighbouring [[Ottoman Turkey|Ottoman hands]], while [[Eastern Armenia]] stayed part of Safavid Iran, until the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 1604, [[Shah Abbas I]] pursued a scorched-earth campaign against the Ottomans in the Ararat valley during the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1603\u201318)]]. The old Armenian town of [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]] in the province of [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]] was taken early in the invasion. From there Abbas' army fanned out across the Araratian plain. The Shah pursued a careful strategy, advancing and retreating as the occasion demanded, determined not to risk his enterprise in a direct confrontation with stronger enemy forces.\n\nWhile laying siege to [[Kars]], he learned of the approach of a large Ottoman army, commanded by Djghazad\u00e9 [[Sinan Pasha]]. The order to withdraw was given; but to deny the enemy the potential to resupply themselves from the land, he ordered the wholesale destruction of the Armenian towns and farms on the plain. As part of this the whole population was ordered to accompany the Persian army in its withdrawal. Some 300,000 people were duly herded to the banks of the [[Araxes River]]. Those who attempted to resist the mass deportation were killed outright. The Shah had previously ordered the destruction of the only bridge, so people were forced into the waters, where a great many drowned, carried away by the currents, before reaching the opposite bank. This was only the beginning of their ordeal. One eye-witness, Father de Guyan, describes the predicament of the refugees thus:\n\n:''It was not only the winter cold that was causing torture and death to the deportees. The greatest suffering came from hunger. The provisions which the deportees had brought with them were soon consumed&nbsp;... The children were crying for food or milk, none of which existed, because the women's breasts had dried up from hunger&nbsp;... Many women, hungry and exhausted, would leave their famished children on the roadside, and continue their tortuous journey. Some would go to nearby forests in search of something to eat. Usually they would not come back. Often those who died, served as food for the living.''\n\nUnable to maintain his army on the desolate plain, Sinan Pasha was forced to winter in [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. Armies sent in pursuit of the Shah in 1605 were defeated, and by 1606 Abbas had regained all of the territory lost to the Turks earlier in his reign. The scorched-earth tactic had worked, though at a terrible cost to the Armenian people. Of the 300,000 deported it is calculated that less than half survived the march to [[Isfahan]]. In the conquered territories Abbas established the [[Erivan khanate|Erivan Khanate]], a [[Muslim]] principality under the dominion of the [[Safavid Empire]].

Examples include: the [[Khanate of Erevan]], [[Khanate of Nakhichevan]] and the [[Karabakh Khanate]].\n\nEven though [[Western Armenia]] had already once been conquered by the Ottomans following the Peace of Amasya, Greater Armenia was eventually decisively divided between the vying rivals, the Ottomans and the Safavids, in the first half of the 17th century following the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1623\u201339)]] and the resulting [[Treaty of Zuhab]] under which [[Eastern Armenia]] remained under Persian rule, and [[Western Armenia]] remained under Ottoman rule.<ref name=\"eastern\" />\n\nPersia continued to rule [[Eastern Armenia]], which included all of the modern-day Armenian Republic, until the first half of the 19th century.

In 1804, [[Pavel Tsitsianov]] [[Battle of Ganja (1804)|invaded]] the Iranian town of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] and massacred many of its inhabitants while making the rest flee deeper within the borders of Qajar Iran. This was a declaration of war and regarded as an invasion of Iranian territory.{{sfn|Fisher|1991|p=332}} It was the beginning of the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]]. The following years were devastating for the Iranian towns in the Caucasus as well as the inhabitants of the region, as well as for the Persian army. The war eventually ended in 1813 with a Russian victory after their successful [[storming of Lankaran]] in early 1813. The [[Treaty of Gulistan]] that was signed in the same year forced Qajar Iran to irrevocably cede significant amounts of its [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] territories to Russia, comprising modern-day [[Dagestan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and most of what is today the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].<ref>Timothy C.

Mehmed and his successors used the religious systems of their subject nationalities as a method of population control, and so Ottoman Sultans invited an Armenian archbishop to establish the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The Armenians of Constantinople grew in numbers, and became respected, if not full, members of Ottoman society.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire ruled in accordance to [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. As such, the [[People of the Book]] (the [[Christianity|Christians]] and the [[Judaism|Jews]]) had to pay an extra tax to fulfil their status as [[dhimmi]] and in return were guaranteed religious autonomy.

Under heavy pressure from the combined forces of the Ottoman army and the Kurdish irregulars, the Republic was forced to withdraw from Erzincan to Erzurum. In the end, the Republic had to evacuate Erzurum as well.\n\nFurther southeast, in Van, the Armenians resisted the Turkish army until April 1918, but eventually were forced to evacuate it and withdraw to Persia.

In November 1920, the [[Turkish revolutionaries]] captured Alexandropol and were poised to move in on the capital. A cease fire was concluded on 18 November. Negotiations were then carried out between [[K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir]] and a peace delegation led by [[Alexander Khatisian]] in Alexandropol; although Karabekir's terms were extremely harsh the Armenian delegation had little recourse but to agree to them. The [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] was signed on 3 December 1920, although the Armenian government had already fallen to the Soviets the day before.<ref>Hovannisian.

Armenia decided to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army.

At that point what was left of Armenia was under the influence of the [[Bolsheviks]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAlthough the Bolsheviks succeeded in ousting the Turks from their positions in Armenia, they decided to establish peace with Turkey. In 1921, the Bolsheviks and the Turks signed the [[Treaty of Kars]], in which Turkey ceded [[Adjara]] to the USSR in exchange for the Kars territory (today the Turkish provinces of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[I\u011fd\u0131r Province|Surmalu]], and [[Ardahan Province|Ardahan]]). The land given to Turkey included the ancient city of [[Ani]] and [[Mount Ararat]], the spiritual Armenian homeland. In 1922, the newly proclaimed [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], under the leadership of [[Aleksandr Myasnikyan|Alexander Miasnikyan]], became part of the [[Soviet Union]] as one of three republics comprising the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Armenia in the Soviet Union (1922\u20131991)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n{{Main|Armenian SSR}}\n[[File:Emblem of the Armenian SSR.svg|thumb|The coat of arms of [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]] depicting [[Mount Ararat]] in the center.]]\nThe Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved in 1936 and as a result Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union as the [[Armenian SSR|Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The transition to [[communism]] was difficult for Armenia, and for most of the other republics in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities placed Armenians under strict surveillance. There was almost no [[freedom of speech]], even less so under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Any individual who was suspected of using or introducing [[nationalist]] [[rhetoric]] or elements in their works were labelled traitors or propangandists, and were sent to [[Siberia]] during Stalinist rule. Even [[Zabel Yesayan|Zabel Yessayan]], a writer who was fortunate enough to escape from ethnic cleansing during the [[Armenian Genocide]], was quickly exiled to Siberia after returning to Armenia from [[France]].\n\nSoviet Armenia participated in [[World War II]] by sending hundreds of thousands of soldiers to the front line in order to defend the \"Soviet motherland.\" Soviet rule had some positive aspects. Armenia benefited from the Soviet economy, especially when it was at its apex. Provincial villages gradually became towns and towns gradually became cities. Peace between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] was reached, albeit temporarily. During this time, Armenia had a sizeable Azeri minority, mostly centred in [[Yerevan]]. Likewise, Azerbaijan had an Armenian minority, concentrated in [[Baku]] and [[Kirovabad]].\n\nMany Armenians still had nationalist sentiments, even though they were discouraged from expressing them publicly. On 24 April 1965, tens of thousands of Armenians flooded the streets of Yerevan to remind the world of the horrors that their parents and grandparents endured during the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915. This was the first public demonstration of such high numbers in the [[USSR]], which defended national interests rather than collective ones. In the late 1980s, Armenia was suffering from pollution. With [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s introduction of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]], public demonstrations became more common. Thousands of Armenians demonstrated in Yerevan because of the USSR's inability to address simple ecological concerns. Later on, with the conflict in [[Karabakh]], the demonstrations obtained a more nationalistic flavour. Many Armenians began to demand statehood.\n\nIn 1988, the [[Spitak earthquake]] killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed multiple towns in northern Armenia, such as [[Gyumri|Leninakan]] (modern-day [[Gyumri]]) and [[Spitak]]. Many families were left without electricity and running water. The harsh situation caused by the earthquake and subsequent events made many residents of Armenia leave and settle in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]] or [[Australia]].\n\nOn 20 February 1988, interethnic fighting between the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijanis broke out shortly after the parliament of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], an autonomous oblast in Azerbaijan, voted to unify the region with Armenia. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Nagorno-Karabakh war]] pitted Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, backed by Armenia, against the [[Army of Azerbaijan]].\n\n==Independent Armenia (1991-today)==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:DistributionOfArmeniansInTheCaucasus.png|thumb|Distribution of Armenians in the Caucasus]]\n[[Armenia]] declared its sovereignty from the [[Soviet Union]] on 23 August 1991. In the wake of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]], a [[referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. Following an overwhelming vote in favour, full independence was declared on 21 September 1991. However, widespread recognition did not occur until the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union on 25 December 1991.\n\nArmenia faced many challenges during its first years as a [[sovereign state]]. Several Armenian organizations from around the world quickly arrived to offer aid and to participate in the country's early years.  From Canada, a group of young students and volunteers under the [[CYMA - Canadian Youth Mission to Armenia]] banner arrived in Ararat Region and became the first youth organization to contribute to the newly independent Republic.\n\nFollowing the Armenian victory in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]], both [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Turkey]] closed their borders and imposed a blockade which they retain to this day, severely affecting the economy of the fledgling republic. In October 2009 Turkey and Armenia signed a treaty to normalize relations.<!--status post-treaty?? -->\n\n===Ter-Petrosyan Presidency (1991\u20131998)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Film Matyan ankakhutyan.jpg|thumb|Inauguration of [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]] as president in 1991]]\n[[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]] was popularly elected the first President of the newly independent Republic of Armenia on 16 October 1991 and re-elected on 22 September 1996. His re-election was marred by allegations of electoral fraud reported by the opposition and supported by many international observers. His popularity waned further as the opposition started blaming him for the economic quagmire that Armenia's post-Soviet economy was in. He was also unpopular with one party in particular, the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], which he banned and jailed on the grounds that the party had a foreign-based leadership\u2014something which was forbidden according to the Armenian Constitution.\n\nTer-Petrosyan was forced to step down in February 1998 after advocating compromised settlement of the conflict over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] which many Armenians regarded as undermining their security. Ter-Petrosyan's key ministers, led by then-Prime Minister [[Robert Kocharyan]], refused to accept a peace plan for Karabakh put forward by international mediators in September 1997. The plan, accepted by Ter-Petrosyan and [[Azerbaijan]], called for a \"phased\" settlement of the conflict which would postpone an agreement on Karabakh's status, the main stumbling block. That agreement was to accompany the return of most Armenian-controlled Azerbaijani territories around Karabakh and the lifting of the [[Azerbaijan]]i and [[Turkey|Turkish]] blockades of Armenia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n===Kocharyan Presidency (1998\u20132008)===\n[[File:Robert Kocharyan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Kocharyan]]]]\nAfter the resignation of his predecessor [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]], [[Robert Kocharyan]] was elected Armenia's second President on 30 March 1998, defeating his main rival, [[Karen Demirchyan]], in an [[Armenian presidential election, 1998|early presidential election marred by irregularities and violations]] by both sides as reported by international electoral observers.

The city has a long history, and was of considerable importance in the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. The [[Arles, Roman and Romanesque Monuments|Roman and Romanesque Monuments of Arles]] were listed as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s in 1981. The Dutch [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] painter [[Vincent van Gogh]] lived in Arles from 1888 to 1889 and produced over 300 paintings and drawings during his time there. An international photography festival has been held in the city since 1970.\n\n==Geography==\nThe river [[Rh\u00f4ne]] forks into two branches just upstream of Arles, forming the [[Camargue]] delta. Because the Camargue is for a large part administratively part of Arles, the commune as a whole is the largest [[communes of France|commune]] in [[Metropolitan France]] in terms of territory, although its population is only slightly more than 50,000. Its area is {{convert|758.93|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, which is more than seven times the area of [[Paris]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient era===\n[[File:Ar\u00e8nes d'Arles 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arles Amphitheatre]], a Roman arena]]\n[[File:Passageway in Roman arena.JPG|thumb|left|Passageway in the Amphitheatre]]\n[[File:Arles Kreuzgang B220798.JPG|thumb|left|[[Church of St. Trophime]] and its cloister]]\nThe [[Ligures|Ligurians]] were in this area from about 800 BC. Later, [[Celts|Celtic]] influences have been discovered. The city became an important [[Phoenicia]]n trading port, before being taken by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\nThe Romans took the town in 123 BC and expanded it into an important city, with a canal link to the Mediterranean Sea being constructed in 104 BC. However, it struggled to escape the shadow of [[Marseille|Massalia]] (Marseille) further along the coast.\n\nIts chance came when it sided with [[Julius Caesar]] against [[Pompey]], providing military support. Massalia backed Pompey; when Caesar emerged victorious, Massalia was stripped of its possessions, which were transferred to Arelate as a reward. The town was formally established as a colony for veterans of the [[Roman legion]] [[Legio VI Ferrata|Legio VI ''Ferrata'']], which had its base there. Its full title as  a colony was ''Colonia Iulia Paterna Arelatensium Sextanorum'', \"the ancestral Julian colony of Arles of the soldiers of the Sixth.\"\n\nArelate was a city of considerable importance in the province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. It covered an area of some {{convert|40|ha}} and possessed a number of monuments, including [[Arles Amphitheatre|an amphitheatre]], [[triumphal arch]], [[Roman circus#row-Arelate|Roman circus]], [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], and a full circuit of walls. Ancient Arles was closer to the sea than it is now and served as a major port. It also had (and still has) the southernmost bridge on the Rh\u00f4ne. Very unusually, the Roman bridge was not fixed but consisted of a pontoon-style [[bridge of boats]], with towers and drawbridges at each end. The boats were secured in place by anchors and were tethered to twin towers built just upstream of the bridge. This unusual design was a way of coping with the river's frequent violent floods, which would have made short work of a conventional bridge. Nothing remains of the Roman bridge, which has been replaced by a more modern bridge near the same spot.\n\nThe city reached a peak of influence during the 4th and 5th centuries, when [[Roman Emperor]]s frequently used it as their headquarters during military campaigns. In 395, it became the seat of the [[Praetor]]ian Prefecture of the [[Gaul]]s, governing the western part of the Western Empire: Gaul proper plus [[Hispania]] (Spain) and [[Armorica]] ([[Brittany]]). At that time, the city was perhaps home to 75,000&ndash;100,000 people.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/1166147/_The_Fall_and_Decline_of_the_Roman_Urban_Mind_</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=nyQVAgAAQBAJ |page=78 |title=Rick Steves' Provence & the French Riviera }}</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=ZmA18QOiBUUC |page=1173 |title=Nelson's Dictionary of Christianity: The Authoritative Resource on the Christian World }}</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=wZqSDRP6vuoC |page=81 |title=Provence }}</ref>\n\nIt became a favorite city of Emperor [[Constantine I]], who built [[Thermae|baths]] there, substantial remains of which are still standing. His son, [[Constantine II of the Roman Empire|Constantine II]], was born in Arles. [[Roman usurper|Usurper]] [[Constantine III (usurper)|Constantine III]] declared himself emperor in the West (407\u2013411) and made Arles his capital in 408.\n\nArles became renowned as a cultural and religious centre during the late Roman Empire. It was the birthplace of the sceptical philosopher [[Favorinus]]. It was also a key location for Roman Christianity and an important base for the [[Christianization]] of Gaul. The [[Ancient Diocese of Arles|city's bishopric]] was held by a series of outstanding clerics, beginning with [[Saint Trophimus]] around 225 and continuing with Saint [[Honoratus]], then Saint [[Hilary of Arles|Hilarius]] in the first half of the 5th century. The political tension between the Catholic bishops of Arles and the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kings is epitomized in the career of the Frankish St. [[Caesarius of Arles|Caesarius, bishop of Arles]] 503\u2013542, who was suspected by the [[Arianism|Arian]] Visigoth [[Alaric II]] of conspiring with the [[Burgundians]] to turn over the Arelate to Burgundy, and was exiled for a year to Bordeaux in Aquitaine. Political tensions were evident again in 512, when Arles held out against [[Theodoric the Great]] and Caesarius was imprisoned and sent to [[Ravenna]] to explain his actions before the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] king.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/htm/iii.iii.iv.htm Wace, ''Dictionary''])</ref>\n\nThe friction between the Arian Christianity of the [[Visigoths]] and the Catholicism of the bishops sent out from Rome established deep roots for religious [[heterodoxy]], even [[heresy]], in [[Occitan]] culture. At [[Treves]] in 385, [[Priscillian]] achieved the distinction of becoming the first Christian executed for [[heresy]] ([[Manichaean]] in his case, see also [[Cathar]]s, [[Camisards]]). Despite this tension and the city's decline in the face of [[barbarian]] invasions, Arles remained a great religious centre and host of church councils (see [[Council of Arles]]), the rival of [[Vienne, Is\u00e8re|Vienne]], for hundreds of years.\n\n===Roman aqueduct and mill===\n[[File:Aqueduc Romain pr\u00e8s de Fontvieille 2.JPG|thumb|Aqueduct of Arles at Barbegal]]\nThe [[Barbegal aqueduct and mill]] is a [[List of Roman watermills|Roman watermill]] complex located on the territory of the commune of [[Fontvieille, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne|Fontvieille]], a few kilometres from Arles. The complex has been referred to as \"the greatest known concentration of mechanical power in the [[ancient world]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Kevin |last=Greene |title=Technological Innovation and Economic Progress in the Ancient World: M.I.

There are two aqueducts which join just north of the mill complex, and a sluice which enabled the operators to control the water supply to the complex. The mill consisted of 16 waterwheels in two separate rows built into a steep hillside. There are substantial masonry remains of the water channels and foundations of the individual mills, together with a staircase rising up the hill upon which the mills are built. The mills apparently operated from the end of the 1st century until about the end of the 3rd century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 |title=Ville d'Histoire et de Patrimoine |publisher=Patrimoine.ville-arles.fr |accessdate=2013-03-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206194648/http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 |archivedate=2013-12-06 }}</ref> The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of [[flour]] per day, sufficient to supply enough bread for 6,000 of the 30\u201340,000 inhabitants of Arelate at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etab.ac-caen.fr/lescourtils/provence/barbegal.htm |title=La meunerie de Barbegal |publisher=Etab.ac-caen.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> A similar mill complex existed also on the [[Janiculum]] in [[Rome]]. Examination of the [[mill leat]] still just visible on one side of the hill shows a substantial accretion of lime in the channel, tending to confirm its long working life.\n\nIt is thought that the wheels were overshot [[water wheels]] with the outflow from the top driving the next one down and so on, to the base of the hill. Vertical water mills were well known to the Romans, being described by [[Vitruvius]] in his [[De Architectura]] of 25 BC, and mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Naturalis Historia]] of 77 AD. There are also later references to floating water mills from [[Byzantium]] and to [[sawmill]]s on the river [[Moselle]] by the poet [[Ausonius]]. The use of multiple stacked sequences of [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]s was widespread in Roman mines.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Arles Place de la R\u00e9publique.jpg|thumb|Place de la R\u00e9publique.]]\n[[File:Vincent Willem van Gogh - Cafe Terrace at Night (Yorck).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Cafe Terrace at Night]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]] (September 1888), depicts the warmth of a caf\u00e9 in Arles]]\nIn 735, after raiding the Lower Rh\u00f4ne, [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Saracen]]s led by [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri]] moved into the stronghold summoned by Count [[Maurontus]], who feared [[Charles Martel]]'s expansionist ambitions, though this may have been an excuse to further Moorish expansion beyond Iberia. The next year, Charles campaigned south to Septimania and Provence, attacking and capturing Arles after destroying Avignon. In 739. Charles definitely drove Maurontus to exile, and brought [[Provence]] to heel. In 855, it was made the capital of a Frankish [[Kingdom of Arles]], which included [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and part of Provence, but was frequently terrorised by Saracen and [[Viking]] raiders. In 888, Rudolph, Count of [[Auxerre]] (now in north-western Burgundy), founded the kingdom of [[Bourgogne Transjurane|Transjuran Burgundy]] (literally, beyond the Jura mountains), which included western Switzerland as far as the river Reuss, [[Valais]], [[Geneva]], [[Chablais]] and [[Bugey]].\n\nIn 933, [[Hugh of Arles]] (\"Hugues de Provence\") gave his kingdom up to Rudolph II, who merged the two kingdoms into a new Kingdom of Arles. In 1032, King [[Rudolf III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] died, and the kingdom was inherited by Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] the Salic. Though his successors counted themselves kings of Arles, few went to be crowned in the cathedral. Most of the kingdom's territory was progressively incorporated into France. During these troubled times, [[Arles Amphitheatre|the amphitheatre]] was converted into a fortress, with watchtowers built at each of the four quadrants and a minuscule [[walled town]] being constructed within. The population was by now only a fraction of what it had been in Roman times, with much of old Arles lying in ruins.\n\nThe town regained political and economic prominence in the 12th century, with the Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] traveling there in 1178 for his coronation. In the 12th century, it became a free city governed by an elected ''[[podestat]]'' (chief magistrate; literally \"power\"), who appointed the [[consuls]] and other magistrates. It retained this status until the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.\n\nArles joined the countship of Provence in 1239, but, once more, its prominence was eclipsed by Marseilles. In 1378, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] ceded the remnants of the Kingdom of Arles to the [[Dauphin of France]] (later King [[Charles VI of France]]) and the kingdom ceased to exist even on paper.\n[[File:Vincent van Gogh, Ploughman in the Fields near Arles, 1888, NGA 76291.jpg|alt=pen and ink drawing of a ploughman in a field near Arles, by Vincent Van Gogh |thumb|''Ploughman in the Fields near Arles'' (1888) by [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent Van Gogh]], [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\n[[File:Calles de Arles.jpg|thumb|Rue Ernest Renan in Arles]]\n\n===Modern era===\nArles remained economically important for many years as a major port on the Rh\u00f4ne. In the 19th century, the arrival of the railway diminished river trade, leading to the town becoming something of a backwater.\n\nThis made it an attractive destination for the painter [[Vincent van Gogh]], who arrived there on 21 February 1888. He was fascinated by the Proven\u00e7al landscapes, producing over 300 paintings and drawings during his time in Arles. Many of his most famous paintings were completed there, including ''[[The Night Cafe]]'', the ''[[Bedroom in Arles|Yellow Room]]'', ''[[Starry Night Over the Rhone]]'', and ''[[L'Arl\u00e9sienne (painting)|L'Arl\u00e9sienne]]''. [[Paul Gauguin]] visited van Gogh in Arles. However, van Gogh's mental health deteriorated and he became alarmingly eccentric, culminating in the well-known ear-severing incident in December 1888 which resulted in two stays in the [[Hospital in Arles (Van Gogh series)|Old Hospital of Arles]]. The concerned Arlesians circulated a petition the following February demanding that van Gogh be confined. In May 1889, he took the hint and left Arles for the [[Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-R\u00e9my (Van Gogh series)|Saint-Paul]] asylum at nearby [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]].\n\n===Jewish history===\n{{Main|History of the Jews in Arles}}\nArles had an important and prominent Jewish community between the Roman era and the end of the 15th century. A local legend describes the first Jews in Arles as exiles from [[Judaea]] after [[Jerusalem]] fell to the Romans. Nevertheless, the first documented evidence of Jews in Arles is not before the fifth century, when a distinguished community already existed in the town. Arles was an important Jewish crossroads, as a port city and close to [[Spain]] and the rest of Europe alike. It served a major role in the work of the [[Hachmei Provence]] group of  famous Jewish scholars, translators and philosophers, who were most important to Judaism throughout the Middle Ages.\nIn the eighth century, jurisdiction over the Jews of Arles was passed to the local Archbishop, making the Jewish taxes to the clergy somewhat of a shield for the community from mob attacks, most frequent during the [[Crusades]]. The community lived relatively peacefully until the last decade of the 15th century, when they were expelled out of the city never to return. Several Jews did live in the city in the centuries after, though no community was found ever after. Nowadays, Jewish archaeological findings and texts from Arles can be found in the local museum.<ref>http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1784-arles</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nArles has a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|warm summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Csa'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fr.climate-data.org/europe/france/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/arles-7789/|title=Climat Arles: Temp\u00e9rature moyenne Arles, diagramme climatique pour Arles - Climate-Data.org|website=fr.climate-data.org|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref> with a mean annual temperature of 14.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (1948\u20131999).

The larger bust was tentatively dated to 46 BC. Since the bust displayed several characteristics of an ageing person with wrinkles, deep naso-labial creases and hollows in his face, and since the archaeologists believed that [[Julius Caesar]] had founded the colony ''Colonia Iulia Paterna Arelate Sextanorum'' in 46 BC, the scientists came to the preliminary conclusion that the bust depicted a life-portrait of the Roman dictator: France's Minister of Culture [[Christine Albanel]] reported on May 13, 2008, that the bust would be the oldest representation of Caesar known today.<ref>[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/communiq/albanel/cesarles08.htm Original communiqu\u00e9] (May 13, 2008); [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/communiq/albanel/arles200508.htm second communiqu\u00e9] (May 20, 2008); [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/index-com.html report] (May 20, 2008)</ref> The story was picked up by all larger media outlets.<ref>E.g.{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/05/14/caesar.bust.ap/index.html |title=Divers find marble bust of Caesar that may date to 46 B.C. |accessdate=2008-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605231523/http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/05/14/caesar.bust.ap/index.html |archivedate=2008-06-05 }} , CNN-Online ''et al.''</ref><ref>[http://programmes.france3.fr/des-racines-et-des-ailes/index-fr.php?page=emission&id_article=89 Video (QuickTime)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528215723/http://programmes.france3.fr/des-racines-et-des-ailes/index-fr.php?page=emission&id_article=89 |date=May 28, 2008 }} on the archaeological find (France 3)</ref> The realism of the portrait was said to place it in the tradition of late Republican portrait and genre sculptures. The archaeologists further claimed that a bust of Julius Caesar might have been thrown away or discreetly disposed of, because Caesar's portraits could have been viewed as politically dangerous possessions after the dictator's assassination.\n\nHistorians and archaeologists not affiliated with the French administration, among them Paul Zanker, the renowned archaeologist and expert on Caesar and [[Augustus]], were quick to question whether the bust is a portrait of Caesar.<ref>Paul Zanker, [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/,ra16m1/wissen/special/67/174544/index.html/wissen/artikel/74/176540/article.html \"Der Echte war energischer, distanzierter, ironischer\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529012528/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/%2Cra16m1/wissen/special/67/174544/index.html/wissen/artikel/74/176540/article.html |date=May 29, 2008 }}, ''Sueddeutsche Zeitung'', May 25, 2008, on-line</ref><ref>[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], [http://timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life/2008/05/the-face-of-jul.html\"The face of Julius Caesar?

Elkins, [http://coinarchaeology.blogspot.com/2008/05/oldest-bust-of-julius-caesar-found-in.html 'Oldest Bust' of Julius Caesar found in France?], May 14, 2008, on-line</ref> Many noted the lack of resemblances to Caesar's likenesses issued on coins during the last years of the dictator's life, and to the [[Tusculum]] bust of Caesar,<ref>Cp. this [http://www.aeria.phil.uni-erlangen.de/photo_html/portraet/roemisch/republik/benannt/caesar/caesar5.JPG image] at the ''AERIA'' library</ref> which depicts Julius Caesar in his lifetime, either as a so-called ''zeitgesicht'' or as a direct portrait. After a further stylistic assessment, Zanker dated the Arles-bust to the Augustan period. Elkins argued for the third century AD as the ''terminus post quem'' for the deposition of the statues, refuting the claim that the bust was thrown away due to feared repercussions from Caesar's assassination in 44 BC.<ref>A different approach was presented by Mary Beard, in that members of a military Caesarian colony would not have discarded portraits of Caesar, whom they worshipped as god, although statues were in fact destroyed by the Anti-Caesarians in the city of Rome after Caesar's assassination ([[Appian]], ''BC'' III.1.9).</ref> The main argument by the French archaeologists that Caesar had founded the colony in 46 BC proved to be incorrect, as the colony was founded by Caesar's former [[quaestor]] [[Tiberius Nero|Tiberius Claudius Nero]] on the dictator's orders in his absence.<ref>Konrat Ziegler & Walther Sontheimer (eds.), \"Arelate\", in ''Der Kleine Pauly: Lexikon der Antike'', Vol. 1, col. 525, Munich 1979; in 46 BC, Caesar himself was campaigning in Africa, before later returning to Rome.</ref> Mary Beard has accused the persons involved in the find of having willfully invented their claims for publicity reasons. The French ministry of culture has not yet responded to the criticism and negative reviews.\n\n==Sport==\n\n[[AC Arles-Avignon]] is a professional French football team. They currently play in Championnat de France Amateur, the fourth division in French football. They play at the [[Parc des Sports (Avignon)|Parc des Sports]], which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n==Culture==\nArles is a cultural hotspot. A well known photography festival, [[Rencontres d'Arles]], takes place in Arles every year, and the French national school of photography is located there.\n\nThe major French publishing house Actes Sud is also situated in Arles.\n\nIn the past years, several cultural organizations set up a presence in Arles, such as the [[LUMA Foundation]], the [[Fondation Vincent van Gogh Arles]], the [[Manuel Rivera-Ortiz Foundation]] or the [[Lee Ufan]] Foundation.<ref name=\"larpenteur\">{{Cite web|url=http://scerri6.wixsite.com/lartpenteur/single-post/2018/01/06/Arles-Lee-Ufan|title=Arles : Lee Ufan va cr\u00e9er une nouvelle fondation d'art contemporain|publisher=L'AR(T)PENTEUR|accessdate=2018-05-19}}</ref> On top of that, there are countless galleries scattered throughout the city.\n\n[[Bullfighting|Bullfight]]s are conducted in the [[Arles Amphitheatre|amphitheatre]], including Proven\u00e7al-style bullfights (''courses camarguaises'') in which the bull is not killed, but rather a team of athletic men attempt to remove a tassle from the bull's horn without getting injured. Every Easter and on the first weekend of September, during the [[Feria d'Arles|feria]], Arles also holds Spanish-style ''[[bullfighting|corridas]]'' (in which the bulls are killed) with an ''[[encierro]]'' (bull-running in the streets) preceding each fight.\n\nThe parts of the films ''[[Ronin (movie)|Ronin]]'', ''[[At Eternity's Gate (film)|At Eternity's Gate]]'' and \"[[Taxi 3 (film)|Taxi 3]]\" were filmed in Arles.\n\n===European Capital of Culture===\n\nArles played a major role in [[Marseille-Provence 2013]], the year-long series of cultural events held in the region after it was designated the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2013. The city hosted a segment of the opening ceremony with a pyrotechnical performance by Groupe F on the banks of the Rh\u00f4ne. It also unveiled the new wing of the Mus\u00e9e D\u00e9partemental Arles Antique as part of Marseille-Provence 2013.\n\n==Economy==\nArles's open-air street market is a major market in the region.  It occurs on Saturday and Wednesday mornings.\n\n==Transport==\nThe [[Gare d'Arles]] railway station offers connections to [[Avignon]], [[N\u00eemes]], [[Marseille]], [[Paris]], [[Bordeaux]] and several regional destinations.\n\nArles does not have its own commercial airport, but is served by a number of airports in the region, most notably the major international airport of [[Marseille Provence Airport|Marseille Provence]] approximately an hour's drive away.\n\nThe [[A54 autoroute]] toll motorway, which locally connects [[Salon-de-Provence]] with [[N\u00eemes]] and in a wider sense forms part of [[European route E80]], passes by Arles.\n\nThe [[Rh\u00f4ne]], which for navigation purposes is classified as a [[Classification of European Inland Waterways|Class V waterway]] as far upstream as [[Lyon]], is an historically important transport route connecting the inland [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] region with the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  The port of Arles and its adjacent rail and road connections provides a major [[transshipment]] node, which in 2013 handled approximately 450,000 tonnes of goods.<ref>{{cite web |title=Le port d'Arles

south of France, in the [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]] [[Departments of France|department]], of which it is a [[Subprefectures in France|subprefecture]], in the former [[Provinces of France|province]] of [[Provence]].\n\nA large part of the [[Camargue]] is located on the territory of the commune, making it the largest commune in [[Metropolitan France]] in terms of territory (though [[Maripasoula]], [[French Guiana]], is much larger). The city has a long history, and was of considerable importance in the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. The [[Arles, Roman and Romanesque Monuments|Roman and Romanesque Monuments of Arles]] were listed as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s in 1981. The Dutch [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] painter [[Vincent van Gogh]] lived in Arles from 1888 to 1889 and produced over 300 paintings and drawings during his time there. An international photography festival has been held in the city since 1970.\n\n==Geography==\nThe river [[Rh\u00f4ne]] forks into two branches just upstream of Arles, forming the [[Camargue]] delta. Because the Camargue is for a large part administratively part of Arles, the commune as a whole is the largest [[communes of France|commune]] in [[Metropolitan France]] in terms of territory, although its population is only slightly more than 50,000. Its area is {{convert|758.93|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, which is more than seven times the area of [[Paris]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient era===\n[[File:Ar\u00e8nes d'Arles 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arles Amphitheatre]], a Roman arena]]\n[[File:Passageway in Roman arena.JPG|thumb|left|Passageway in the Amphitheatre]]\n[[File:Arles Kreuzgang B220798.JPG|thumb|left|[[Church of St. Trophime]] and its cloister]]\nThe [[Ligures|Ligurians]] were in this area from about 800 BC. Later, [[Celts|Celtic]] influences have been discovered. The city became an important [[Phoenicia]]n trading port, before being taken by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\nThe Romans took the town in 123 BC and expanded it into an important city, with a canal link to the Mediterranean Sea being constructed in 104 BC. However, it struggled to escape the shadow of [[Marseille|Massalia]] (Marseille) further along the coast.\n\nIts chance came when it sided with [[Julius Caesar]] against [[Pompey]], providing military support. Massalia backed Pompey; when Caesar emerged victorious, Massalia was stripped of its possessions, which were transferred to Arelate as a reward. The town was formally established as a colony for veterans of the [[Roman legion]] [[Legio VI Ferrata|Legio VI ''Ferrata'']], which had its base there. Its full title as  a colony was ''Colonia Iulia Paterna Arelatensium Sextanorum'', \"the ancestral Julian colony of Arles of the soldiers of the Sixth.\"\n\nArelate was a city of considerable importance in the province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. It covered an area of some {{convert|40|ha}} and possessed a number of monuments, including [[Arles Amphitheatre|an amphitheatre]], [[triumphal arch]], [[Roman circus#row-Arelate|Roman circus]], [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], and a full circuit of walls. Ancient Arles was closer to the sea than it is now and served as a major port. It also had (and still has) the southernmost bridge on the Rh\u00f4ne. Very unusually, the Roman bridge was not fixed but consisted of a pontoon-style [[bridge of boats]], with towers and drawbridges at each end. The boats were secured in place by anchors and were tethered to twin towers built just upstream of the bridge. This unusual design was a way of coping with the river's frequent violent floods, which would have made short work of a conventional bridge. Nothing remains of the Roman bridge, which has been replaced by a more modern bridge near the same spot.\n\nThe city reached a peak of influence during the 4th and 5th centuries, when [[Roman Emperor]]s frequently used it as their headquarters during military campaigns. In 395, it became the seat of the [[Praetor]]ian Prefecture of the [[Gaul]]s, governing the western part of the Western Empire: Gaul proper plus [[Hispania]] (Spain) and [[Armorica]] ([[Brittany]]). At that time, the city was perhaps home to 75,000&ndash;100,000 people.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/1166147/_The_Fall_and_Decline_of_the_Roman_Urban_Mind_</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=nyQVAgAAQBAJ |page=78 |title=Rick Steves' Provence & the French Riviera }}</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=ZmA18QOiBUUC |page=1173 |title=Nelson's Dictionary of Christianity: The Authoritative Resource on the Christian World }}</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=wZqSDRP6vuoC |page=81 |title=Provence }}</ref>\n\nIt became a favorite city of Emperor [[Constantine I]], who built [[Thermae|baths]] there, substantial remains of which are still standing. His son, [[Constantine II of the Roman Empire|Constantine II]], was born in Arles. [[Roman usurper|Usurper]] [[Constantine III (usurper)|Constantine III]] declared himself emperor in the West (407\u2013411) and made Arles his capital in 408.\n\nArles became renowned as a cultural and religious centre during the late Roman Empire. It was the birthplace of the sceptical philosopher [[Favorinus]]. It was also a key location for Roman Christianity and an important base for the [[Christianization]] of Gaul. The [[Ancient Diocese of Arles|city's bishopric]] was held by a series of outstanding clerics, beginning with [[Saint Trophimus]] around 225 and continuing with Saint [[Honoratus]], then Saint [[Hilary of Arles|Hilarius]] in the first half of the 5th century. The political tension between the Catholic bishops of Arles and the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kings is epitomized in the career of the Frankish St. [[Caesarius of Arles|Caesarius, bishop of Arles]] 503\u2013542, who was suspected by the [[Arianism|Arian]] Visigoth [[Alaric II]] of conspiring with the [[Burgundians]] to turn over the Arelate to Burgundy, and was exiled for a year to Bordeaux in Aquitaine. Political tensions were evident again in 512, when Arles held out against [[Theodoric the Great]] and Caesarius was imprisoned and sent to [[Ravenna]] to explain his actions before the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] king.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/htm/iii.iii.iv.htm Wace, ''Dictionary''])</ref>\n\nThe friction between the Arian Christianity of the [[Visigoths]] and the Catholicism of the bishops sent out from Rome established deep roots for religious [[heterodoxy]], even [[heresy]], in [[Occitan]] culture. At [[Treves]] in 385, [[Priscillian]] achieved the distinction of becoming the first Christian executed for [[heresy]] ([[Manichaean]] in his case, see also [[Cathar]]s, [[Camisards]]). Despite this tension and the city's decline in the face of [[barbarian]] invasions, Arles remained a great religious centre and host of church councils (see [[Council of Arles]]), the rival of [[Vienne, Is\u00e8re|Vienne]], for hundreds of years.\n\n===Roman aqueduct and mill===\n[[File:Aqueduc Romain pr\u00e8s de Fontvieille 2.JPG|thumb|Aqueduct of Arles at Barbegal]]\nThe [[Barbegal aqueduct and mill]] is a [[List of Roman watermills|Roman watermill]] complex located on the territory of the commune of [[Fontvieille, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne|Fontvieille]], a few kilometres from Arles. The complex has been referred to as \"the greatest known concentration of mechanical power in the [[ancient world]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Kevin |last=Greene |title=Technological Innovation and Economic Progress in the Ancient World: M.I.

There are two aqueducts which join just north of the mill complex, and a sluice which enabled the operators to control the water supply to the complex. The mill consisted of 16 waterwheels in two separate rows built into a steep hillside. There are substantial masonry remains of the water channels and foundations of the individual mills, together with a staircase rising up the hill upon which the mills are built. The mills apparently operated from the end of the 1st century until about the end of the 3rd century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 |title=Ville d'Histoire et de Patrimoine |publisher=Patrimoine.ville-arles.fr |accessdate=2013-03-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206194648/http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 |archivedate=2013-12-06 }}</ref> The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of [[flour]] per day, sufficient to supply enough bread for 6,000 of the 30-40,000 inhabitants of Arelate at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etab.ac-caen.fr/lescourtils/provence/barbegal.htm |title=La meunerie de Barbegal |publisher=Etab.ac-caen.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> A similar mill complex existed also on the [[Janiculum]] in [[Rome]]. Examination of the [[mill leat]] still just visible on one side of the hill shows a substantial accretion of lime in the channel, tending to confirm its long working life.\n\nIt is thought that the wheels were overshot [[water wheels]] with the outflow from the top driving the next one down and so on, to the base of the hill. Vertical water mills were well known to the Romans, being described by [[Vitruvius]] in his [[De Architectura]] of 25 BC, and mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Naturalis Historia]] of 77 AD. There are also later references to floating water mills from [[Byzantium]] and to [[sawmill]]s on the river [[Moselle]] by the poet [[Ausonius]]. The use of multiple stacked sequences of [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]s was widespread in Roman mines.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Arles Place de la R\u00e9publique.jpg|thumb|Place de la R\u00e9publique.]]\n[[File:Vincent Willem van Gogh - Cafe Terrace at Night (Yorck).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Cafe Terrace at Night]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]] (September 1888), depicts the warmth of a caf\u00e9 in Arles]]\nIn 735, after raiding the Lower Rh\u00f4ne, [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Saracen]]s led by [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri]] moved into the stronghold summoned by Count [[Maurontus]], who feared [[Charles Martel]]'s expansionist ambitions, though this may have been an excuse to further Moorish expansion beyond Iberia. The next year, Charles campaigned south to Septimania and Provence, attacking and capturing Arles after destroying Avignon. In 739. Charles definitely drove Maurontus to exile, and brought [[Provence]] to heel. In 855, it was made the capital of a Frankish [[Kingdom of Arles]], which included [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and part of Provence, but was frequently terrorised by Saracen and [[Viking]] raiders. In 888, Rudolph, Count of [[Auxerre]] (now in north-western Burgundy), founded the kingdom of [[Bourgogne Transjurane|Transjuran Burgundy]] (literally, beyond the Jura mountains), which included western Switzerland as far as the river Reuss, [[Valais]], [[Geneva]], [[Chablais]] and [[Bugey]].\n\nIn 933, [[Hugh of Arles]] (\"Hugues de Provence\") gave his kingdom up to Rudolph II, who merged the two kingdoms into a new Kingdom of Arles. In 1032, King [[Rudolf III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] died, and the kingdom was inherited by Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] the Salic. Though his successors counted themselves kings of Arles, few went to be crowned in the cathedral. Most of the kingdom's territory was progressively incorporated into France. During these troubled times, [[Arles Amphitheatre|the amphitheatre]] was converted into a fortress, with watchtowers built at each of the four quadrants and a minuscule [[walled town]] being constructed within. The population was by now only a fraction of what it had been in Roman times, with much of old Arles lying in ruins.\n\nThe town regained political and economic prominence in the 12th century, with the Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] traveling there in 1178 for his coronation. In the 12th century, it became a free city governed by an elected ''[[podestat]]'' (chief magistrate; literally \"power\"), who appointed the [[consuls]] and other magistrates. It retained this status until the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.\n\nArles joined the countship of Provence in 1239, but, once more, its prominence was eclipsed by Marseilles. In 1378, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] ceded the remnants of the Kingdom of Arles to the [[Dauphin of France]] (later King [[Charles VI of France]]) and the kingdom ceased to exist even on paper.\n[[File:Vincent van Gogh, Ploughman in the Fields near Arles, 1888, NGA 76291.jpg|alt=pen and ink drawing of a ploughman in a field near Arles, by Vincent Van Gogh |thumb|''Ploughman in the Fields near Arles'' (1888) by [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent Van Gogh]], [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\n[[File:Calles de Arles.jpg|thumb|Rue Ernest Renan in Arles]]\n\n===Modern era===\nArles remained economically important for many years as a major port on the Rh\u00f4ne. In the 19th century, the arrival of the railway diminished river trade, leading to the town becoming something of a backwater.\n\nThis made it an attractive destination for the painter [[Vincent van Gogh]], who arrived there on 21 February 1888. He was fascinated by the Proven\u00e7al landscapes, producing over 300 paintings and drawings during his time in Arles. Many of his most famous paintings were completed there, including ''[[The Night Cafe]]'', the ''[[Bedroom in Arles|Yellow Room]]'', ''[[Starry Night Over the Rhone]]'', and ''[[L'Arl\u00e9sienne (painting)|L'Arl\u00e9sienne]]''. [[Paul Gauguin]] visited van Gogh in Arles. However, van Gogh's mental health deteriorated and he became alarmingly eccentric, culminating in the well-known ear-severing incident in December 1888 which resulted in two stays in the [[Hospital in Arles (Van Gogh series)|Old Hospital of Arles]]. The concerned Arlesians circulated a petition the following February demanding that van Gogh be confined. In May 1889, he took the hint and left Arles for the [[Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-R\u00e9my (Van Gogh series)|Saint-Paul]] asylum at nearby [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]].\n\n===Jewish history===\n{{Main|History of the Jews in Arles}}\nArles had an important and prominent Jewish community between the Roman era and the end of the 15th century. A local legend describes the first Jews in Arles as exiles from [[Judaea]] after [[Jerusalem]] fell to the Romans. Nevertheless, the first documented evidence of Jews in Arles is not before the fifth century, when a distinguished community already existed in the town. Arles was an important Jewish crossroads, as a port city and close to [[Spain]] and the rest of Europe alike. It served a major role in the work of the [[Hachmei Provence]] group of  famous Jewish scholars, translators and philosophers, who were most important to Judaism throughout the Middle Ages.\nIn the eighth century, jurisdiction over the Jews of Arles was passed to the local Archbishop, making the Jewish taxes to the clergy somewhat of a shield for the community from mob attacks, most frequent during the [[Crusades]]. The community lived relatively peacefully until the last decade of the 15th century, when they were expelled out of the city never to return. Several Jews did live in the city in the centuries after, though no community was found ever after. Nowadays, Jewish archaeological findings and texts from Arles can be found in the local museum.<ref>http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1784-arles</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nArles has a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|warm summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Csa'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fr.climate-data.org/europe/france/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/arles-7789/|title=Climat Arles: Temp\u00e9rature moyenne Arles, diagramme climatique pour Arles - Climate-Data.org|website=fr.climate-data.org|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref> with a mean annual temperature of 14.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (1948\u20131999).

The larger bust was tentatively dated to 46 BC. Since the bust displayed several characteristics of an ageing person with wrinkles, deep naso-labial creases and hollows in his face, and since the archaeologists believed that [[Julius Caesar]] had founded the colony ''Colonia Iulia Paterna Arelate Sextanorum'' in 46 BC, the scientists came to the preliminary conclusion that the bust depicted a life-portrait of the Roman dictator: France's Minister of Culture [[Christine Albanel]] reported on May 13, 2008, that the bust would be the oldest representation of Caesar known today.<ref>[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/communiq/albanel/cesarles08.htm Original communiqu\u00e9] (May 13, 2008); [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/communiq/albanel/arles200508.htm second communiqu\u00e9] (May 20, 2008); [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/index-com.html report] (May 20, 2008)</ref> The story was picked up by all larger media outlets.<ref>E.g.{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/05/14/caesar.bust.ap/index.html |title=Divers find marble bust of Caesar that may date to 46 B.C. |accessdate=2008-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605231523/http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/05/14/caesar.bust.ap/index.html |archivedate=2008-06-05 }} , CNN-Online ''et al.''</ref><ref>[http://programmes.france3.fr/des-racines-et-des-ailes/index-fr.php?page=emission&id_article=89 Video (QuickTime)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528215723/http://programmes.france3.fr/des-racines-et-des-ailes/index-fr.php?page=emission&id_article=89 |date=May 28, 2008 }} on the archaeological find (France 3)</ref> The realism of the portrait was said to place it in the tradition of late Republican portrait and genre sculptures.

Elkins argued for the third century AD as the ''terminus post quem'' for the deposition of the statues, refuting the claim that the bust was thrown away due to feared repercussions from Caesar's assassination in 44 BC.<ref>A different approach was presented by Mary Beard, in that members of a military Caesarian colony would not have discarded portraits of Caesar, whom they worshipped as god, although statues were in fact destroyed by the Anti-Caesarians in the city of Rome after Caesar's assassination ([[Appian]], ''BC'' III.1.9).</ref> The main argument by the French archaeologists that Caesar had founded the colony in 46 BC proved to be incorrect, as the colony was founded by Caesar's former [[quaestor]] [[Tiberius Nero|Tiberius Claudius Nero]] on the dictator's orders in his absence.<ref>Konrat Ziegler & Walther Sontheimer (eds.), \"Arelate\", in ''Der Kleine Pauly: Lexikon der Antike'', Vol. 1, col. 525, Munich 1979; in 46 BC, Caesar himself was campaigning in Africa, before later returning to Rome.</ref> Mary Beard has accused the persons involved in the find of having willfully invented their claims for publicity reasons. The French ministry of culture has not yet responded to the criticism and negative reviews.\n\n==Sport==\n\n[[AC Arles-Avignon]] is a professional French football team. They currently play in Championnat de France Amateur, the fourth division in French football. They play at the [[Parc des Sports (Avignon)|Parc des Sports]], which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n==Culture==\nArles is a cultural hotspot. A well known photography festival, [[Rencontres d'Arles]], takes place in Arles every year, and the French national school of photography is located there.\n\nThe major French publishing house Actes Sud is also situated in Arles.\n\nIn the past years, several cultural organizations set up a presence in Arles, such as the [[LUMA Foundation]], the [[Fondation Vincent van Gogh Arles]], the [[Manuel Rivera-Ortiz Foundation]] or the [[Lee Ufan]] Foundation.<ref name=\"larpenteur\">{{Cite web|url=http://scerri6.wixsite.com/lartpenteur/single-post/2018/01/06/Arles-Lee-Ufan|title=Arles : Lee Ufan va cr\u00e9er une nouvelle fondation d'art contemporain|publisher=L'AR(T)PENTEUR|accessdate=2018-05-19}}</ref> On top of that, there are countless galleries scattered throughout the city.\n\n[[Bullfighting|Bullfight]]s are conducted in the [[Arles Amphitheatre|amphitheatre]], including Proven\u00e7al-style bullfights (''courses camarguaises'') in which the bull is not killed, but rather a team of athletic men attempt to remove a tassle from the bull's horn without getting injured. Every Easter and on the first weekend of September, during the [[Feria d'Arles|feria]], Arles also holds Spanish-style ''[[bullfighting|corridas]]'' (in which the bulls are killed) with an ''[[encierro]]'' (bull-running in the streets) preceding each fight.\n\nThe parts of the films ''[[Ronin (movie)|Ronin]]'', ''[[At Eternity's Gate (film)|At Eternity's Gate]]'' and \"[[Taxi 3 (film)|Taxi 3]]\" were filmed in Arles.\n\n===European Capital of Culture===\n\nArles played a major role in [[Marseille-Provence 2013]], the year-long series of cultural events held in the region after it was designated the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2013. The city hosted a segment of the opening ceremony with a pyrotechnical performance by Groupe F on the banks of the Rh\u00f4ne. It also unveiled the new wing of the Mus\u00e9e D\u00e9partemental Arles Antique as part of Marseille-Provence 2013.\n\n==Economy==\nArles's open-air street market is a major market in the region.  It occurs on Saturday and Wednesday mornings.\n\n==Transport==\nThe [[Gare d'Arles]] railway station offers connections to [[Avignon]], [[N\u00eemes]], [[Marseille]], [[Paris]], [[Bordeaux]] and several regional destinations.\n\nArles does not have its own commercial airport, but is served by a number of airports in the region, most notably the major international airport of [[Marseille Provence Airport|Marseille Provence]] approximately an hour's drive away.\n\nThe [[A54 autoroute]] toll motorway, which locally connects [[Salon-de-Provence]] with [[N\u00eemes]] and in a wider sense forms part of [[European route E80]], passes by Arles.\n\nThe [[Rh\u00f4ne]], which for navigation purposes is classified as a [[Classification of European Inland Waterways|Class V waterway]] as far upstream as [[Lyon]], is an historically important transport route connecting the inland [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] region with the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  The port of Arles and its adjacent rail and road connections provides a major [[transshipment]] node, which in 2013 handled approximately 450,000 tonnes of goods.<ref>{{cite web |title=Le port d'Arles |url=http://www.arles.cci.fr/le-port-darles/ |website=CCI du Pays d'Arles |accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Genesius of Arles]], a [[Civil law notary|notary]] [[martyred]] under [[Maximian]]us in 303 or 308\n* [[Vincent van Gogh]], lived here from February 1888 until May 1889. \n* [[Jenny Berthelius]] (1923-2019), Swedish crime novelist and children's writer, lived in Arles<ref name=\"nordicwomensliterature.net\">{{cite web|url=https://nordicwomensliterature.net/writers/berthelius-jenny/|title=Berthelius, Jenny -

It educates over 1,400 pupils aged between 11 and 18 and was founded in 1833 by the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]].\n\n==History==\nMadras College, founded in 1833, takes its name from the system of education devised by the school's founder, the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]. However, the origins of the school can be traced to at least the 1490s, through its predecessor institution, the '''Grammar School of St Andrews'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pacific.st-andrews.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exedsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=16&dsqSearch=%28%28%28text%29%3D%27Grammar%27%29AND%28%28text%29%3D%27School%27%29%29}}</ref>\n\nBell was born in St Andrews in 1753, the son of a local magistrate and wig-maker. He studied at the [[University of St Andrews]] where he distinguished himself in mathematics. He became a clergyman of the [[Church of England]] and took up an appointment as chaplain to the regiments of the [[East India Company]] in [[Chennai|Madras]] (known since 1996 as Chennain), [[Indian]]. One of his duties was to educate the soldiers' children. Because there was a shortage of teachers, he used the older students, who had been taught the lesson by the master, to instruct groups of younger pupils. The pupils who assisted the teacher were called 'monitors'. This method of educational became widely used in schools at home and abroad.\n\nAfter his return from India, Dr Bell made it his life's work to travel the country and encourage schools to adopt 'the [[Madras system]]', as it had come to be known. By the time of his death in 1832, over 10,000 schools were using his methods.\n\n[[File:Madras College, South Street, St. Andrews Fife.jpg|thumb|left|Madras College; the senior school building on South Street, St Andrews]]\nMadras College was founded in 1832 at the bequest and expense of Bell, as the amalgamation of several St Andrews schools. The first amalgamation was in 1833 when the old Grammar School of St Andrews was joined with the \"English\" school (founded in the 1750s) to form the Madras College. The origin of these names being that the Grammar School was taught mostly in [[Latin language|Latin]] while the \"English\" school used English only. The Grammar School stood on the grounds between Blackfriars' Church and Lade Braes; the \"English\" school was on the grounds behind the Church of Holy Trinity, approximately where the town library is today.\n\nThe second amalgamation happened in 1963, when Madras College was merged with the Burgh School (founded 1889, based in Abbey Walk). As part of this amalgamation and the introduction of comprehensive education, a new school building was contracted on Kilrymont Road, a mile and a half from the South Street building. The Kilrymont building was constructed in a [[modernist]] style, with adjacent playing fields and was opened in 1967.\n\nThe school is the only secondary school in Scotland on a split site. The school catchment area takes in a large part of rural north east Fife, and most of the pupils are transported in from the surrounding area by buses.\n\nThe badge is a chevron between three bells \u2013 a reference to Dr. Bell. The Latin motto is \"''pro rege et grege''\" which is customarily translated as \"For King and People\". It reminds the students of the importance of the idea of service to the community.\n\nBell also left money for schools in [[Inverness]] (Faraline Park, now Inverness Library), [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Leith]] (Commercial Street) and [[Cupar]] (now called [[Bell Baxter High School]], formerly Madras Academy).\n\n== Staff ==\n\n=== Rectors ===\nFrom the foundation of Madras College in 1833 until 1888, the school was run by a board of trustees. As part of a series of reforms made at Madras in 1888/89, the position of rector was established. Since 1889 there have been eleven rectors of Madras College:\n\n* 1889\u20131915 Mr J.

Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]].\n\n==History==\nMadras College, founded in 1833, takes its name from the system of education devised by the school's founder, the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]. However, the origins of the school can be traced to at least the 1490s, through its predecessor institution, the '''Grammar School of St Andrews'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pacific.st-andrews.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exedsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=16&dsqSearch=%28%28%28text%29%3D%27Grammar%27%29AND%28%28text%29%3D%27School%27%29%29}}</ref>\n\nBell was born in St Andrews in 1753, the son of a local magistrate and wig-maker. He studied at the [[University of St Andrews]] where he distinguished himself in mathematics. He became a clergyman of the [[Church of England]] and took up an appointment as chaplain to the regiments of the [[East India Company]] in [[Chennai|Madras]] (known since 1996 as Chennai), [[India]]. One of his duties was to educate the soldiers' children. Because there was a shortage of teachers, he used the older students, who had been taught the lesson by the master, to instruct groups of younger pupils. The pupils who assisted the teacher were called 'monitors'. This method of education became widely used in schools at home and abroad.\n\nAfter his return from India, Dr Bell made it his life's work to travel the country and encourage schools to adopt 'the [[Madras system]]', as it had come to be known. By the time of his death in 1832, over 10,000 schools were using his methods.\n\n[[File:Madras College, South Street, St. Andrews Fife.jpg|thumb|left|Madras College; the senior school building on South Street, St Andrews]]\nMadras College was founded in 1832 at the bequest and expense of Bell, as the amalgamation of several St Andrews schools. The first amalgamation was in 1833 when the old Grammar School of St Andrews was joined with the \"English\" school (founded in the 1750s) to form the Madras College. The origin of these names being that the Grammar School was taught mostly in [[Latin language|Latin]] while the \"English\" school used English only. The Grammar School stood on the grounds between Blackfriars' Church and Lade Braes; the \"English\" school was on the grounds behind the Church of Holy Trinity, approximately where the town library is today.\n\nThe second amalgamation happened in 1963, when Madras College was merged with the Burgh School (founded 1889, based in Abbey Walk). As part of this amalgamation and the introduction of comprehensive education, a new school building was contracted on Kilrymont Road, a mile and a half from the South Street building. The Kilrymont building was constructed in a [[modernist]] style, with adjacent playing fields and was opened in 1967.\n\nThe school is the only secondary school in Scotland on a split site. The school catchment area takes in a large part of rural north east Fife, and most of the pupils are transported in from the surrounding area by buses.\n\nThe badge is a chevron between three bells \u2013 a reference to Dr. Bell. The Latin motto is \"''pro rege et grege''\" which is customarily translated as \"For King and People\". It reminds the students of the importance of the idea of service to the community.\n\nBell also left money for schools in [[Inverness]] (Faraline Park, now Inverness Library), [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Leith]] (Commercial Street) and [[Cupar]] (now called [[Bell Baxter High School]], formerly Madras Academy).\n\n== Staff ==\n\n=== Rectors ===\nFrom the foundation of Madras College in 1833 until 1888, the school was run by a board of trustees. As part of a series of reforms made at Madras in 1888/89, the position of rector was established. Since 1889 there have been eleven rectors of Madras College:\n\n* 1889\u20131915 Mr J.

Many tribes used Arkansas as their hunting lands but the main tribe was the [[Quapaw people|Quapaw]], who settled in the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] delta upon moving south from [[Illinois]].

Upon gaining statehood in 1836, [[Arkansas]] had begun to prosper under a [[plantation economy]] that was heavily reliant on slave labor. After the [[American Civil War]], Arkansas was a poor rural state based on cotton. Prosperity returned in the 1940s and it became famous for its political leadership, including President [[Bill Clinton]] (Governor, 1979\u201381 and 1983\u201392), and as the base for the [[Walmart]] Corporation.\n\n==Early Arkansas==\n\n===Paleo and Archaic periods===\n{{Main|Archaic period in the Americas|Paleo-Indians}}\nBeginning around 11,700 [[Common era|B.C.E.]], the first indigenous people inhabited the area now known as Arkansas after crossing today's [[Bering Strait]], formerly [[Beringia]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Origins: Ice Age Migrations 28,000 \u2013 11,500 B.C. |url= http://iansofarkansas/index.html?pageName=Ice%20Age%20Migrations |last= Sabo III |first= George |date= December 18, 2008 |work= Indians of Arkansas |accessdate= January 20, 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The first people in modern-day Arkansas likely hunted [[woolly mammoth]]s by running them off cliffs or using [[Clovis point]]s, and began to fish as major rivers began to thaw towards the end of [[Late Glacial Maximum|the last great ice age]].<ref>Arnold 2002, p. 5.</ref> Forests also began to grow around 9500 BCE, allowing for more gathering by native peoples.

De Soto wandered among settlements, inquiring about gold and other valuable natural resources. He encountered the [[Casqui]] in northeast Arkansas, who sent him north around [[Reverie, Tennessee|Devil's Elbow]] to the [[Pacaha]], the traditional enemies of the Casqui.

After finding nothing he considered of value and encountering native resistance the entire way; he and his men returned to the Mississippi River where de Soto fell ill. From his deathbed he ordered his men to massacre all of the men of the nearby village of Anilco, who he feared had been plotting an attack with a powerful polity down the Mississippi River, [[Quigualtam]]. His men obeyed and did not stop with killing the men, but were said to have massacred women and children as well. He died the following day in what is believed to be the vicinity of modern-day [[McArthur, Arkansas|McArthur]] in May 1542. His body was weighted down with sand and he was consigned to a watery grave in the Mississippi River under cover of darkness by his men.\n\nDe Soto had attempted to deceive the native population into thinking he was an immortal deity, sun of the sun, in order to forestall attack by outraged Native Americans on his by then weakened and bedraggled army. In order to keep the ruse up, his men informed the locals that de Soto had ascended into the sky. His will at the time of his death listed: \"four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs.\" which were auctioned off to his men. His starving men, who had been living off maize stolen from Native Americans and who had not been allowed to eat the enormous herd of hogs but had had to care for them, immediately started to butcher them. Later on his remaining men, now commanded by his aide de camp Moscoso, attempted an overland return to Mexico. They made it as far as Texas before running into territory too dry for maize farming and too thinly populated to sustain themselves by stealing food from the locals. The expedition promptly backtracked to Arkansas. After building a small fleet of boats they then headed down the Mississippi River and eventually on to Mexico by water.<ref name=HUDSONKNIGHTS>{{cite book| authorlink =Charles M.

The most capable male slaves were often separated from their families and relocated to the swamps of southeast Arkansas. These swamplands were poorly drained, and many planters required their slaves to work long hours clearing trees from the swamps by hand. Slaves were forced to live in cramped slave quarters in the densely forested swamps, surrounded by disease-carrying mosquitoes. Conditions were brutal; slaves often received only one pair of clothes per year, given on [[Christmas]] by the planter family. Diets consisted of only [[fatback]] and [[cornmeal]], usually lacking in vegetables and other necessities to stave off deficiencies.<ref>Bolton 1999, p. 10.</ref>\n\nLife as a slave was unbearable.<ref>Gatewood and Whayne 1993, p. 15.</ref> Though quite dangerous, some slaves would leave their plantations late at night to meet with slaves on other plantations to worship and comfort each other. These meetings were clandestine. Very few planters gave permission to their slaves to have these meetings.<ref>Moneyhon 1999, p. 34.</ref> Often slaves were threatened if they didn't work fast enough. They had to work in horrible conditions, with broken tools, even when they didn't understand instructions at the threat of violence.

Relationships also happened between slaves on different plantations and between slaves and their owners.<ref>Bolton 1999, p. 14.</ref> In a very unusual situation, one female slave named Abby Guy sued her owner for freedom in 1855 and won two jury trials, and her freedom was sustained by the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1861 just as the Civil War was beginning.<ref>Mahan, Russell, Abby Guy: Race and Slavery on Trial in an 1855 Southern Court; Historical Enterprises, Santa Clara, Utah, 2017.</ref> Nothing made the slave experience more bearable. The planters had ultimate control over their slaves and helped perpetuate slavery.<ref>Arnold et al. 2002, p. 144.</ref>\n\n===Pioneer women===\nDuring the frontier period in Arkansas, women were viewed as uncritical and were generally kept indoors. Southern churches often linked the definitions of slavery and marriage in the Bible, thus Southerners viewed an attack on slavery as an attack on families. Historiographers have indicated that men and women understood one another's roles, even though this did not fit with classical Southern [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] of the day. Churches managed to link slavery and marriage so inextricably that poor yeoman farmers supported slavery as they viewed northern abolitionists were attacking families in addition to the institution of slavery. Pastors were heavily influenced toward this message by planters with a vested interest in the survival of slavery.\n\n[[File:Arkansasturnoftune.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''The Turning of the Tune: Traveller Playing the \"Arkansas Traveller,\" '' lithograph by [[Currier and Ives]], 1870]]\nSimilar to slaves, women were often brought along to the frontier with men looking to make a living in the Arkansas delta. These women were transported from their social circles in town to an isolated frontier homestead and a hardscrabble existence. Although the [[Victorian morality|Victorian ideals]] of men and women maintaining different spheres of influence still held strong in communities, the system broke down on the frontier when survival took priority over the social contract.<ref>Gatewood and Whayne 1993, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Women were often tasked with maintaining the property's day-to-day operations while their husbands were away conducting business. This included dealing with slave overseers or the farm's labor itself.<ref name=\"wo\" >Arnold et al 2002, p. 119.</ref> This break from Victorian principles often went unacknowledged by frontier men and women, however.<ref name=\"wo\" />\n\nMany women founded the first marks of civilization in their areas, including schools and churches. Women often met with other women at church and had many superficial friendships to repel loneliness.<ref name=\"wo\" /> Health care on the frontier was the responsibility for women, as very few doctors were available. If an entire household fell ill, a neighboring woman was responsible for nursing them back to health.<ref>{{ cite web |title= Women |first= Lea Flowers |last= Baker |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=400 |work= Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture |publisher= The Pryor Center |date= October 17, 2012 |accessdate= January 4, 2013}}</ref> Childbirth also weighed on women as a risky proposition that often resulted in the death of the mother. As a result, the process was feared, dreaded, and often went unmentioned in diaries from the period. The pressures of childbirth, being the primary health care provider and chief farm operator upon their husband's departure gave many frontier women anxiety.\n\n==Early years of the state==\n[[File:OldStateHouseLittleRock2008.jpg|right|thumb|[[Old State House (Little Rock, Arkansas)|Arkansas State House]] at [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]]]\n{{See also|The Family (Arkansas politics)}}\nThe question of statehood was first raised by [[National Republican Party|National Republican]] [[Benjamin Desha]] in 1831 in the ''Little Rock Arkansas Advocate''. This position was contrary to the Democrats and [[The Family (Arkansas politics)|The Family]], who feared that the taxation required to maintain state government would be onerous on the state's meager population. Arkansas's Territorial Delegate and Family member [[Ambrose Sevier]] shared this concern about high taxes; however his inability to vote with [[Andrew Jackson]] to oppose the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], the National Bank and other various economic policies eventually made him more amenable to statehood.<ref>Bolton 1999, p. 20.</ref>\n\nWhen it was announced that [[Michigan]] would be applying for statehood as a free state, Sevier knew the abolitionists would have a numerical advantage in the U.S. Senate unless Arkansas also entered as a slave state as a result of the [[Missouri Compromise]].<ref>{{ cite web |title= Louisiana Purchase through Early Statehood, 1803 through 1860 |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=398 |publisher= Butler Center for Arkansas Studies at the Central Arkansas Library System |work= Arkansas Encyclopedia of History and Culture |date= October 2, 2014 |first= S.

Tax rates were very low in all Southern states controlled by planters, and Arkansas was no exception. Most planters did not carry a lot of cash and were usually indebted to cotton factories most months of the year. The little extra cash planters had was usually invested in slaves or land, leaving most plantations in the margins for long periods of time. The northwest parts of Arkansas that did not rely on cotton production relied on a cash scarce economy that consisted of bartering for necessities. Although farmers produced enough goods to sell, they were locked into the local market and were unable to transport their goods to other markets, keeping the region cash-poor. The Federal government gave land to the state, to be sold for seed money to start a treasury for Arkansas.<ref>Worley 1949, p. 179.</ref> These funds were quickly wasted, and since frontier Arkansas did not offer many services to its citizens, revenues from taxes and fees were incapable of supporting the state government. President Jackson's ''[[Specie Circular]]'' also hurt the state economy by forcing land purchases to be made with gold and silver rather than paper money. In addition to affecting private citizens who were land speculating, the policy stymied state revenues since Arkansas had been relying on the tax revenue from each land purchase as its primary source of income.<ref>Worley 1949, p. 184.</ref>\n\n[[File:AR Conway James Sevier.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[James Sevier Conway|James Conway]]]]\nArkansas considered selling bonds to raise funds, but the frontier state remained an unknown and was not seen as a safe investment. The state also lacked agencies capable of issuing bonds, until Governor [[James Sevier Conway|James Conway]] signed acts which chartered two banks during Arkansas's first legislative session, a State Bank and a Real Estate Bank. This system had contemporaries in many other states. The Real Estate Bank was to be privately owned by shareholders, but too few shareholders bought in, causing the state to fund both banks. A showdown on the state legislature floor ended with knives being drawn. President of the Real Estate Bank/Speaker of the Arkansas House John Wilson killed state legislator Joseph Anthony after Anthony offered a bill that criticized Wilson's management of the Real Estate Bank. Wilson was acquitted of murder but expelled from the legislature.<ref>Fletcher 1989, p. 54.</ref> Wilson was reelected in 1840, and later had to be restrained in another [[knife fight]].\n\nIn 1836, Arkansas was to be the recipient of funds from the Deposit and Distribution Act, rumored by some to be as much as $1 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1|1836|r=2}}}} million in today's dollars).<ref>Worley 1949, p. 185.</ref> A very important sources of seed money for the State Bank; the program encountered a harsh recession that limited its effectiveness.

The proximity of the city of [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] to the Texas border involved the town in the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1835\u201336. Some evidence suggests [[Sam Houston]] and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at Washington in 1834.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasmediaroom.com/news-releases/listings/display.asp?id=165|title=Old Washington State Park Conserves Town's Heyday|first=Jim|last=Taylor|access-date=2007-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909034934/http://www.arkansasmediaroom.com/news-releases/listings/display.asp?id=165|archive-date=2007-09-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> When the fighting began a stream of volunteers from Arkansas and the eastern states flowed through the town toward the Texas battlefields.\n\nWhen the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] began in 1846, Washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops. Governor [[Thomas S. Drew|Thomas Drew]] issued a proclamation calling on the state to furnish one regiment of cavalry and one battalion of infantry to join the United States Army. Ten companies of men assembled here where they were formed into the first Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry.\n\n===Late antebellum period===\nThe young state began to show its first signs of improving beyond a frontier wilderness in the 1850s. The growing need for cotton gave many Arkansans an avenue to become involved in market economy for the first time, a transition that made the state significantly more prosperous. At the time, the most efficient way to grow cotton was a plantation-style system, and this quickly became the norm in the southeast part of Arkansas. During the late antebellum period, most Arkansans were identified with farming and ranching. Fewer worked as carpenters, blacksmiths, gunsmiths, and wagon builders and fewer still as lawyers, doctors, and teachers. This economic shift also allowed some Arkansans to work outside the factory or field as artisans, including James Black who is credited with creating the first [[Bowie Knife]] in Arkansas during the period. Improving transportation also helped the state's economy grow. The [[Southwest Trail]] and [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] were major roads in the state, and steamboats began using the state's rivers for commerce. Arkansas increased its cotton production from {{convert|6000000|lbs|kg}} in 1840 to {{convert|26000000|lbs|kg}} in 1850.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, pp. 140\u2013141.</ref> Arkansas and the southeast grew rapidly due to cotton, but its use of the plantation system would ultimately set the state and region behind the rest of the nation for decades.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, p. 135.</ref> Southeast Arkansas became significantly more prosperous than the northwestern highlands, causing a rift to form between the two regions.\n\n[[File:Henry Massey Rector.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Henry Massey Rector|Henry Rector]]]]\nAlthough the slave issue had been tabled following the Missouri Compromise, it again came to the forefront when [[California]]'s admission to the Union threatened the political balance between free and slave states. [[John Selden Roane|John Roane]], [[William K. Sebastian|William Sebastian]], [[Solon Borland]], and [[Robert Ward Johnson|Robert Johnson]] began rallying support for the Southern cause in Arkansas, including discussing secession. However, most Arkansans were looking to compromise and preserve the Union. After the [[Compromise of 1850]], several Family members in favor of secession acquired political office, including [[Elias Conway]] as governor. [[Thomas Hindman]], a lawyer from [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] and strong supporter of Southern rights, acquired the congressional seat in Arkansas's northern district with the support of the Family.<ref>Ferguson 1965, p. 4.</ref> Hindman would later side with [[Henry Massey Rector|Henry Rector]] against the Family, and both were successful in 1860.<ref>Ferguson 1965, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> During this time, the nation was continuing to grapple with the slavery issue. The [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] decision and [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]] kept slavery in the news. The creation of a Republican party who wanted to restrict the spread of slavery gave abolitionists a new option at the polls.\n\n[[Abraham Lincoln]] was elected President in 1860 when Rector became the first governor from outside the Family. Although Arkansans were leery of Lincoln, they were unsure of Rector's position with regard to secession.<ref>Ferguson 1965, p. 13.</ref><ref>Dougan 1976, p. 35.</ref> Hindman, Johnson, and [[Edward Gantt]] continued to advocate the Southern rights cause along with those loyal to the Family.<ref>Ferguson 1965, p. 15.</ref> [[South Carolina]] voted to secede in December 1860, and Hindman called for a secession vote, a move backed by Rector.<ref>Ferguson 1965, p. 19.</ref> The governor also forced the surrender of the garrison in Little Rock after rumors of Lincoln reinforcing the outfit.<ref>Dougan 1965, pp. 41\u201342.</ref> A vote in February 1861 showed Arkansas in favor of a convention on secession but the elected delegates voted to remain in the Union.<ref name=\"b22\">Bolton 1999, p. 22</ref> The convention was close but favored the Union, mirroring the demographics of Arkansas.<ref name=\"b22\" /> Northwest Arkansas was mostly pro-Union and had a slight population majority, and the southeast primarily in favor of secession.<ref>Ferguson 1965, p. 23.</ref>\n\nPresident Lincoln demanded troops be sent, including some Arkansans, to quell the rebellion following the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]] on April 4, 1861. Governor Rector denied the request and ordered troops the state militia to take Fort Smith from federal control.<ref>Dougan 1965, p. 61.</ref> Secession was again put to a vote at the state convention on May 6. Given the recent events, less than 10% of the delegates voted to remain in the Union.<ref>Dougan 1965, p. 62.</ref> Chairman David Walker requested another vote in the interest of obtaining a unanimous decision. Only [[Isaac Murphy]] cast a ballot against secession for the second vote, officially ending Arkansas's membership in the Union.<ref name=\"b22\" />\n\n==Civil War and Reconstruction==\n\n===Secession and Civil War===\n{{Main|Arkansas in the American Civil War}}\n{{See also|List of Arkansas Civil War Confederate units|Arkansas Militia in the Civil War|List of Arkansas Union Civil War Units|Book:Arkansas Confederate Infantry Units}}\n[[File:Hempstead Rifles.jpg|thumb|Officers and men of the Hempstead Rifles are [[Muster (military)|mustered in]] at [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]]]]\nSupport for the Southern cause was great immediately following secession. Many towns sent enthusiastic men with hunting rifles to Little Rock prepared to fight. Citizens across the state thought victory over the lazy Northerners would come swiftly. Some anti-war organizations formed in northwest Arkansas such as the Arkansas Peace Society, but members of these groups were usually arrested and charged with treason or forced to join Confederate ranks. Geographically Arkansas was a very important state during the war, giving the Rebels control of the Mississippi River and tenuous holds on Missouri, Louisiana and Indian Territory to the west. [[Benjamin McCulloch]] was ordered to defend north Arkansas and Indian Territory; however he elected to lead his troops in to Missouri in support of Maj. Gen. [[Sterling Price]]'s Missouri State Guard, leading to the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] near [[Springfield, Missouri]]. This bloody battle shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and painless victory for the South.\n\nOnce it became apparent to Arkansans and the nation that the war would not be a quick and painless proposition, excitement began to temper. Unpopular Confederate programs like higher taxes and a draft from which one could be exempted from by owning 20 or more slaves became major issues for civilians in addition to the Confederate soldiers losing battles such as the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862. Casualties were high for both sides at the [[Battle of Shiloh]], a function of better rifles, but also poor battlefield medicine. Both sides battled disease, poor nutrition, and transportation issues throughout the war.\n\n[[File:Battle of Pea Ridge.png|thumb|left|[[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in March 1862]]\nThe Union began an offensive across Arkansas in early 1862 in which General [[Samuel Curtis]] led troops near [[Leetown, Arkansas|Leetown]], where the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] occurred. After securing a Union victory, Curtis swept across the state to [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena]]. Curtis intended to knock Arkansas out of the war by capturing Little Rock. However, reinforcements arrived in Spring 1862 under General [[William Steele (general)|William Steele]]. General [[Thomas C. Hindman]], although recently defeated at the [[Battle of Cotton Plant]], attempted to return northwest Arkansas to Confederate control. The [[Battle of Prairie Grove]] was essentially a stalemate, but Hindman's unit withdrew to [[Van Buren, Arkansas|Van Buren]] and was driven from the region completely by December 1862. Union troops defeated a Confederate attack in the Battle of Fayetteville on April 18, 1863, but a week later abandoned Northwest Arkansas and retreated to Missouri for the summer.<ref>Mahan, Russell L. Fayetteville, Arkansas, in the Civil War. Historical Byways, Bountiful, Utah, 2003.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Fort Hindman.png|thumb|[[Battle of Arkansas Post (1863)|Bombardment and capture of Fort Hindman]] at [[Arkansas Post]] in 1863]]\nThe war began to turn against the Confederates in 1863, losing at the [[Battle of Helena]] despite a coordinated attack by generals [[Theophilus H. Holmes]], [[Sterling Price]], [[John S. Marmaduke]], and [[James Fleming Fagan]]. The [[Siege of Vicksburg]] concluded as a Union victory the same day, severely compromising the Rebels' control of the Mississippi River. Later in the year the Union used the post at Helena to capture [[Battle of Little Rock|Little Rock]], forcing the Confederate government to relocate, with the state archives, to [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]]. Despite controlling the state capitol, the Union hold on the state was tenuous. Guerrilla warfare ravaged the countryside and small towns throughout the war.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, p. 200.</ref> Bands of guerrillas often stole from houses and burned fields wherever the Union or Confederate armies were not present.\n\nThe last major fighting within the state occurred during the [[Camden Expedition]] (March 23 \u2013 May 2, 1864). The expedition was a military campaign in southern and central Arkansas which involved Union forces stationed at Little Rock and Fort Smith under the command of Major General Frederick Steele. The plan called for Steele's force to march to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], where it would link up with an amphibious expedition led by Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and Rear Admiral [[David Dixon Porter|David D. Porter]], whose force was to advance up the Red River Valley. Once joined, the Union force was to strike into Texas. But the two pincers never converged, and Steele's columns suffered terrible losses in a series of battles with Confederate forces led by Maj. Gen. [[Sterling Price]] and Gen. [[Edmund Kirby Smith]].\n\n[[File:Battle of Mine Creek.gif|thumb|240px|left|The ''Price Raid'' by [[Samuel J. Reader]]]]\nThe victory by Confederates in the Red River Campaign and its Arkansas segment, the Camden Expedition, opened a brief window of opportunity for Arkansas Confederates. Missouri General Joseph Shelby was dispatched to northeast Arkansas with his cavalry brigade and began recruiting. Throughout the summer of 1864, Confederate strength in northeast Arkansas steadily grew with many men who had either deserted from their previous commands or become separated, returning to Confederate Service. The last formation of new Confederate units occurred during this time with the formation of the 45th through the 48th Arkansas Mounted Infantry units.<ref>Sellmeyer, Deryl P.: \"Jo Shelby's Iron Brigade\", Pelican Publishing Company, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-58980-430-2}}, page 184</ref> Several existing Arkansas units were converted to Mounted Infantry and dispatched to northeast Arkansas. Shelby was eventually able to seriously threaten vital Union lines of communication along the Arkansas River between Helena and Little Rock, and for a while it appeared that Confederates would mount a serious attempt to retake the Capitol in Little Rock. However, Confederate authorities in Richmond were pressuring General Kirby Smith to dispatch some of his infantry to reinforce Confederate armies east of the Mississippi. This caused uproar with the Arkansas Confederate infantry units and as a compromise, General Smith approved a plan by Major General Sterling Price to organize a large-scale raid into Missouri that would coincide with the November 1864 Presidential Elections.<ref>Suderow, Bryce A. \"Pt 1 Natl.

Following Price's defeat at the [[Battle of Westport]] in on October 23, 1864, most of the Arkansas cavalry units returned to the state and were furloughed for the remainder of the war.\n\n[[File:3rd Arkansas Battle Flag, St Andrews Cross.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Military colours, standards and guidons|Regimental Colors]] of the [[3d Arkansas Infantry Regiment (Confederate States)|Third Arkansas]] (1863\u20131865)]]\nWhen the war ended, the [[3d Arkansas Infantry Regiment (Confederate States)|Third Arkansas]] surrendered with Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at [[Appomattox, Virginia]]  on April 9, 1865.

Some planters moved south to [[Brazil]] during the war, including Arkansans. Congress passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] that stated if their master was fighting for the South; a slave could gain freedom by crossing behind Union lines. Following the Union victory at the [[Battle of Antietam]], the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] defined the impetus of further fighting to be slavery. This kept the [[United Kingdom]] out of the war, who were rumored to ready to help the Confederate cause but did not want to be viewed as promoting slavery. Many slaves sought freedom in the North, but arrived only to work on plantations for meager wages since cotton was still an important commodity.\n\n===Reconstruction Era===\n{{See also|Reconstruction Era|Arkansas Militia in Reconstruction|Brooks\u2013Baxter War}}\n[[File:Mustered out, harper's weekly, little rock, AR.jpg|thumb|A drawing of [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]] [[Muster (military)|mustered out]] at [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], 1866.]]\nFollowing the war, the Southern economy was in shambles, including Arkansas. The cost of the war effort, loss of [[human capital]], and Confederate currency losing value were serious issues for the south in addition to the destruction of property, infrastructure, and crops. Emancipated blacks also rushed out of the south following the war. [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s moderate [[ten percent plan]] allowed the Confederate states to return once 10% of their 1860 voters pledged allegiance to the United States and [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]]. A constitutional convention elected [[Isaac Murphy]] provisional governor, the lone vote against secession in the 1861 convention. Confederate loyalists quickly labeled Murphy as a traitor and compromised his effectiveness. Arkansas's two senators [[Elisha Baxter]] and [[William Fishback]] were denied seating in Washington by the Radical Republicans who thought Lincoln's policies were too lenient. Confederate governor [[Harris Flanagin]] brought state documents back from Washington and retired after the war. The [[Arkansas Constitution]] was redrawn in 1864 with the provisions necessitated by the 10% plan. When Lincoln was shot April 15, 1865, the hopes of a painless restoration of the Union died as well.\n\nThe southeast Arkansas planters tried several avenues to maintain cotton production despite emancipation. The system of [[sharecropping]] eventually became most popular, allowing individuals to use farmland, seed, tools and a dwelling provided by the landowner. At season end he received a share of the crop (which in turn was used to pay off local merchants who had provided credit for living expenses.) The duty of supervising these contracts between newly freed slaves and planters was  the responsibility of the federal [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands|Freedman's Bureau]]. Many plantation owners despised paying the same slaves that had run off from their plantation years earlier. Blacks began using their own schools and churches for the first time. Following the frustrations of losing the war and slavery, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) became the military arm of the Democratic party in much of the south, including Arkansas. Tasked with keeping blacks as well as white Republicans on plantations and away from the polls, the KKK and other groups like the [[Bald Knobbers]] reigned terror throughout the state for years.\n\nPresident [[Andrew Johnson]] granted pardons to many leading Confederates. The Confederate veterans in Arkansas formed a conservative political party to oppose the Unionists, lead at first by [[Augustus Hill Garland|Augustus Garland]]. The strong anti-Unionist feelings in the state were evident when Arkansas voters refused to ratify the 14th amendment, guaranteeing citizenship, due process, and equal protection to freedmen, and in fact passed laws restricting freedmen. Once it became clear the South would not return to the Union easily, the [[Reconstruction era of the United States#Military reconstruction|Military Reconstruction Act]] was passed in 1867. Arkansas became a military territory under General [[Edward Ord]].<ref>Herndon 1922, p. 110.</ref>\n\n[[File:OldMainUofA.jpg|thumb|[[University of Arkansas]], founded by the [[Arkansas General Assembly|General Assembly]] in 1868, is one of many public universities in the state.]]\nGeneral Ord kept Governor Murphy in power but dissolved the state legislature. Republicans called a convention in Little Rock in April 1867 in order to discuss how Arkansas could return to the Union. Freedmen began to participate in politics through organizations such as the [[Union League]], including registering blacks for the upcoming election. The election selected seventy delegates to a constitutional convention, composed primarily of [[Radical Republicans]]. The resulting constitution gave blacks full citizenship, due process, and the right to vote, as well as free public schools for all races and the establishment of the [[University of Arkansas]]. The document infuriated many conservatives and many thought it was a partisan document created for the benefit of the Republicans. The new constitution was approved in a corrupt election that also gave many offices to the Republicans. Ord certified the results, as did Congress over the president's veto, and the new Arkansas assembly ratified the 14th amendment, allowing Arkansas to reenter the Union on June 22, 1868.\n\n[[Powell Clayton]], a Union general who had returned to live in Arkansas after the war, was elected governor in the corrupt 1868 election. Clayton took it upon himself to keep the Confederates out of power and protect the newly freed blacks. Many of his political appointments were from northern states, leading his opponents to paint him and his allies as [[carpetbagger]]s. In order to build Arkansas's infrastructure, Clayton raised taxes, another unpopular decision. Financial incentives were given to railroad companies, who ultimately laid {{convert|662|mi|km}} of track by the end of Reconstruction with $9 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|9000000|1875|r=3}}}} in current dollars) in state assistance.\n\nFollowing the 1868 election, many residents were frustrated by the radical Republicans that had taken control of most county offices. The KKK began [[whitecapping]] throughout Arkansas, and Governor Clayton declared [[martial law]] in ten counties, later adding four more. In [[Mississippi County, Arkansas|Mississippi County]], one of the martial law counties, a racially and politically charged event called the Black Hawk War took place in 1872 that is indicative of Reconstruction. County registrar Charles Fitzpatrick rode around with an armed group of blacks, collecting taxes and issuing threats to his opponents. Fitzpatrick accused Sheriff J. B. Murray of misappropriating county funds, and the allegation became a heated argument. When the two met to shake hands at the Osceola Post Office, Murray punched Fitzpatrick, who responded by shooting and killing Murray. Upon Fitzpatrick turning himself in, a trial was held but the judge adjourned the tense court for two days before ordering Fitzpatrick to disperse his company of 200 armed men. Fitzpatrick complied, and the judge went across town to disperse a crowd of KKK members, led by former Confederate Captain Charles Bowen. Both parties dispersed but ran into each other south of town and shots were fired. Fitzpatrick was never convicted and was nominated for the state legislature, but was defeated by Hiram McVeigh.\n\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:TroopsArkansasOldStateHouse.jpg|left|thumb|Baxter's troops gathered in front of the Old State House in Downtown Little Rock, this image is actually inaccurate; the split rail fence had been replaced by a wrought iron one by 1874]] -->\nThe 1872 gubernatorial election was also marked by fraud and corruption. In 1874, the [[Brooks-Baxter War]] shook [[Little Rock]]. The dispute about the legal governor of the state was settled when President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered that [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]] to disperse his militant supporters.\n\n==Growth and industrialization==\n{{Main|The New South}}\n[[File:Augustus Hill Garland - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Augustus Hill Garland|Augustus Garland]]]]\nWhen Congress voted to approve [[Augustus Hill Garland|Augustus Garland]] as governor a year after a corrupt 1874 election, Arkansas and other Southern states began to envision a revolution in which the old Confederate states could update their economies using Northern capital and industry to replace plantation agriculture. Contemporary Arkansans also believed cultural and social change could come with this transition.<ref>Moneyhon 1997, p. 4.</ref> Although changes did take place, the state suffered from agrarian revolt, segregation, public corruption, resistance to change and disfranchisement instead of benefiting from a new diversified economy.<ref>{{harvp|\"Johnson III\"|2019|p= 6}}.</ref>\n\nThe \"New South\" progressive ideals were especially evident in the era's business leaders such as [[Robert E. Lee Wilson|Lee Wilson]] and [[Henry W. Grady|Henry Grady]]. Wilson became one of the most influential Arkansans of his time by exploiting the land, labor and resources available to him. His company towns in northeast Arkansas such as [[Wilson, Arkansas|Wilson]] and [[Marie, Arkansas|Marie]] attracted poor sharecroppers to his logging and farming operations.<ref>{{ cite web |title= Lee Wilson & Company, Yesterday and Today |url= http://libinfo.uark.edu/SpecialCollections/ardiglib/leewilson/history.html |publisher= University of Arkansas Libraries |accessdate= July 15, 2013}}</ref> Amenities such as company housing, a town doctor, and other company-funded businesses not normally found in small towns drove his empire to grow to be the \"World's Largest Plantation\".<ref>{{ cite web |title= The Story of Lee Wilson and Company |page= 3 |publisher= Lee Wilson & Company |url=http://libinfo.uark.edu/SpecialCollections/ardiglib/leewilson/doc/doc52.html |accessdate= July 15, 2013}}</ref> After Wilson's son, Wilson Jr., and his wife returned from their [[England]] honeymoon enthralled with the [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]] style in 1925, all subsequent public buildings were built with Tudor architecture, including retrofits to all existing public structures.<ref>{{ cite web | title= Life in Wilson: Town of Wilson | url= http://libinfo.uark.edu/SpecialCollections/ardiglib/leewilson/town.html |work= Lee Wilson & Company Archives |author = University of Arkansas Libraries Special Collections staff  |accessdate= February 18, 2015}}</ref> The town incorporated in 1959, selling the houses to the renters living in them and gaining access to tax income it was previously excluded from as a company entity.<ref>{{ cite web | title= Life in Wilson: Robert E.

Their migration out of the South was a reach toward a better quality of life where they could vote and live more fully as citizens. Agricultural changes also meant that farm workers were not needed in as great number. Thousands left Arkansas.

Major platform issues for the Wheel included high rates of farm foreclosure, anaconda mortgages, corrupt politicians who failed to assist farming issues, and high railroad rates. Although a strong populous movement, the Wheel struggled to provide a political voice for its supporters. A partnership with the [[Union Labor Party (California)|Union Labor Party]] for the 1888 elections did not provide results as many Wheelers were hesitant to \"betray\" the Democrats who had traditionally earned their vote.\n\n[[File:The scene of the conflict between the Brooks and Baxter adherents in front of the Anthony House, Little Rock (G.

However, the coalition featured two factions who had the same problems but fundamentally disagreed on how to solve them: one of anti-tariff Southern Democrats and another of Northern farmers who were traditionally Republican and supported tariffs. The group became the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populists]] in 1890. During the late 1880s and 1890s, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] worked to consolidate their power and prevent alliances among African Americans and poor whites in the years of agricultural depression. They were facing competition from the new Populist and other third parties. In 1891, state legislators passed a statute requiring a [[literacy test]] for voter registration, when more than 25% of the population could not read or write. In 1892 the state passed a constitutional amendment that imposed a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and associated residency requirements for voting, which combined barriers sharply reduced the numbers of blacks and poor whites on the voter rolls, and voter participation dropped sharply.<ref name=\"oldstatehouse.com\">{{ cite web |url= http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news |title= \"White Primary\" System Bars Blacks from Politics - 1900 |publisher= The Arkansas News |date= Spring 1987 |page= 3 |location= Little Rock, AR |accessdate= March 22, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080503211520/http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/ |archive-date= May 3, 2008 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nWith the right to suffrage, freedmen began to participate vigorously in the political life of the state. From 1869 to 1893, more than 45 African American men were elected to seats in the state legislature. However, having consolidated power among its supporters, by 1900 the state Democratic Party began relying on all-white primaries at the county and state level. This was one more door closed against blacks, as the primaries had become the only competitive political contests; the Democratic Party primary winner was always elected.<ref name=\"oldstatehouse.com\"/> In 1900 African Americans numbered 366,984 in the state and made up 28% of the population \u2013 together with poor whites, more than one-third of the citizens were disenfranchised.<ref>[http://isher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed 15 Mar 2008</ref> Since they could not vote, they could not serve on juries, which were limited to voters.

At the same time, blacks felt they were being exploited and underpaid by white plantation owners. In 1919, 100 frustrated black farmers gathered near [[Elaine, Arkansas|Elaine]] to discuss how to receive a fair wage for their work on the plantations. A fight broke out when a sheriff and railroad detective arrived at the church. The deputy was wounded and the detective killed. As word spread of a \"black uprising\", whites came from the surrounding area to quell the \"rebellion\". Chaos ensued for three days in the town, with mobs roaming the street and random killings throughout.

After finding nothing he considered of value and encountering native resistance the entire way; he and his men returned to the Mississippi River where de Soto fell ill. From his deathbed he ordered his men to massacre all of the men of the nearby village of Anilco, who he feared had been plotting an attack with a powerful polity down the Mississippi River, [[Quigualtam]]. His men obeyed and did not stop with killing the men, but were said to have massacred women and children as well. He died the following day in what is believed to be the vicinity of modern-day [[McArthur, Arkansas|McArthur]] in May 1542. His body was weighted down with sand and he was consigned to a watery grave in the Mississippi River under cover of darkness by his men.\n\nDe Soto had attempted to deceive the native population into thinking he was an immortal deity, sun of the sun, in order to forestall attack by outraged Native Americans on his by then weakened and bedraggled army. In order to keep the ruse up, his men informed the locals that de Soto had ascended into the sky. His will at the time of his death listed: \"four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs.\" which were auctioned off to his men. His starving men, who had been living off maize stolen from Native Americans and who had not been allowed to eat the enormous herd of hogs but had had to care for them, immediately started to butcher them. Later on his remaining men, now commanded by his aide de camp Moscoso, attempted an overland return to Mexico. They made it as far as Texas before running into territory too dry for maize farming and too thinly populated to sustain themselves by stealing food from the locals. The expedition promptly backtracked to Arkansas.

The legislature discussed the issue of relocating the capitol in 1820, but could not decide between [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] and [[Cadron Settlement Park|Cadron]] before the session ended. After the session ended, William Russell, owner of hundreds of lots around Little Rock, began selling them to legislators and influential men like Crittenden, Robert Oden, [[William A.

The most capable male slaves were often separated from their families and relocated to the swamps of southeast Arkansas. These swamplands were poorly drained, and many planters required their slaves to work long hours clearing trees from the swamps by hand. Slaves were forced to live in cramped slave quarters in the densely forested swamps, surrounded by disease-carrying mosquitoes. Conditions were brutal; slaves often received only one pair of clothes per year, given on [[Christmas]] by the planter family. Diets consisted of only [[fatback]] and [[cornmeal]], usually lacking in vegetables and other necessities to stave off deficiencies.<ref>Bolton 1999, p. 10.</ref>\n\nLife as a slave was unbearable.<ref>Gatewood and Whayne 1993, p. 15.</ref> Though quite dangerous, some slaves would leave their plantations late at night to meet with slaves on other plantations to worship and comfort each other. These meetings were clandestine. Very few planters gave permission to their slaves to have these meetings.<ref>Moneyhon 1999, p. 34.</ref> Often slaves were threatened if they didn't work fast enough. They had to work in horrible conditions, with broken tools, even when they didn't understand instructions at the threat of violence. Sometimes conditions were so horrific that slaves would run away at the risk of being tortured and/or murdered if caught.<ref>Moneyhon 1999, pp. 32\u201333.</ref><ref>Bolton 1999, p. 11.</ref> Rarely slaves who were desperate would resort to stealing food or clothes from their master though these things would also end in violence towards the slaves. Slaves' churches often preached the message of [[Moses]] and the [[The Exodus|Exodus]].<ref>Bolton 1999, pp. 13\u201314.</ref> The largest form of rebellion was the slave family.<ref>Moneyhon 1999, p. 26.</ref> Although slave marriages were illegal, many informal relationships were honored by plantation owners who thought a family would keep the slaves from rebelling.<ref>Moneyhon 1999, p. 31.</ref> Planters often used threats against the slave's family such as selling members away, torture, rape and even murder as methods of quelling rebellion. Relationships also happened between slaves on different plantations and between slaves and their owners.<ref>Bolton 1999, p. 14.</ref> In a very unusual situation, one female slave named Abby Guy sued her owner for freedom in 1855 and won two jury trials, and her freedom was sustained by the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1861 just as the Civil War was beginning.<ref>Mahan, Russell, Abby Guy: Race and Slavery on Trial in an 1855 Southern Court; Historical Enterprises, Santa Clara, Utah, 2017.</ref> Nothing made the slave experience more bearable. The planters had ultimate control over their slaves and helped perpetuate slavery.<ref>Arnold et al. 2002, p. 144.</ref>\n\n===Pioneer women===\nDuring the frontier period in Arkansas, women were viewed as uncritical and were generally kept indoors. Southern churches often linked the definitions of slavery and marriage in the Bible, thus Southerners viewed an attack on slavery as an attack on families. Historiographers have indicated that men and women understood one another's roles, even though this did not fit with classical Southern [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] of the day. Churches managed to link slavery and marriage so inextricably that poor yeoman farmers supported slavery as they viewed northern abolitionists were attacking families in addition to the institution of slavery. Pastors were heavily influenced toward this message by planters with a vested interest in the survival of slavery.\n\n[[File:Arkansasturnoftune.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''The Turning of the Tune: Traveller Playing the \"Arkansas Traveller,\" '' lithograph by [[Currier and Ives]], 1870]]\nSimilar to slaves, women were often brought along to the frontier with men looking to make a living in the Arkansas delta. These women were transported from their social circles in town to an isolated frontier homestead and a hardscrabble existence. Although the [[Victorian morality|Victorian ideals]] of men and women maintaining different spheres of influence still held strong in communities, the system broke down on the frontier when survival took priority over the social contract.<ref>Gatewood and Whayne 1993, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Women were often tasked with maintaining the property's day-to-day operations while their husbands were away conducting business. This included dealing with slave overseers or the farm's labor itself.<ref name=\"wo\" >Arnold et al 2002, p. 119.</ref> This break from Victorian principles often went unacknowledged by frontier men and women, however.<ref name=\"wo\" />\n\nMany women founded the first marks of civilization in their areas, including schools and churches. Women often met with other women at church and had many superficial friendships to repel loneliness.<ref name=\"wo\" /> Health care on the frontier was the responsibility for women, as very few doctors were available. If an entire household fell ill, a neighboring woman was responsible for nursing them back to health.<ref>{{ cite web |title= Women |first= Lea Flowers |last= Baker |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=400 |work= Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture |publisher= The Pryor Center |date= October 17, 2012 |accessdate= January 4, 2013}}</ref> Childbirth also weighed on women as a risky proposition that often resulted in the death of the mother. As a result, the process was feared, dreaded, and often went unmentioned in diaries from the period. The pressures of childbirth, being the primary health care provider and chief farm operator upon their husband's departure gave many frontier women anxiety.\n\n==Early years of the state==\n[[File:OldStateHouseLittleRock2008.jpg|right|thumb|[[Old State House (Little Rock, Arkansas)|Arkansas State House]] at [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]]]\n{{See also|The Family (Arkansas politics)}}\nThe question of statehood was first raised by [[National Republican Party|National Republican]] [[Benjamin Desha]] in 1831 in the ''Little Rock Arkansas Advocate''. This position was contrary to the Democrats and [[The Family (Arkansas politics)|The Family]], who feared that the taxation required to maintain state government would be onerous on the state's meager population. Arkansas's Territorial Delegate and Family member [[Ambrose Sevier]] shared this concern about high taxes; however his inability to vote with [[Andrew Jackson]] to oppose the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], the National Bank and other various economic policies eventually made him more amenable to statehood.<ref>Bolton 1999, p. 20.</ref>\n\nWhen it was announced that [[Michigan]] would be applying for statehood as a free state, Sevier knew the abolitionists would have a numerical advantage in the U.S. Senate unless Arkansas also entered as a slave state as a result of the [[Missouri Compromise]].<ref>{{ cite web |title= Louisiana Purchase through Early Statehood, 1803 through 1860 |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=398 |publisher= Butler Center for Arkansas Studies at the Central Arkansas Library System |work= Arkansas Encyclopedia of History and Culture |date= October 2, 2014 |first= S.

Tax rates were very low in all Southern states controlled by planters, and Arkansas was no exception. Most planters did not carry a lot of cash and were usually indebted to cotton factories most months of the year. The little extra cash planters had was usually invested in slaves or land, leaving most plantations in the margins for long periods of time. The northwest parts of Arkansas that did not rely on cotton production relied on a cash scarce economy that consisted of bartering for necessities. Although farmers produced enough goods to sell, they were locked into the local market and were unable to transport their goods to other markets, keeping the region cash-poor. The Federal government gave land to the state, to be sold for seed money to start a treasury for Arkansas.<ref>Worley 1949, p. 179.</ref> These funds were quickly wasted, and since frontier Arkansas did not offer many services to its citizens, revenues from taxes and fees were incapable of supporting the state government. President Jackson's ''[[Specie Circular]]'' also hurt the state economy by forcing land purchases to be made with gold and silver rather than paper money. In addition to affecting private citizens who were land speculating, the policy stymied state revenues since Arkansas had been relying on the tax revenue from each land purchase as its primary source of income.<ref>Worley 1949, p. 184.</ref>\n\n[[File:AR Conway James Sevier.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[James Sevier Conway|James Conway]]]]\nArkansas considered selling bonds to raise funds, but the frontier state remained an unknown and was not seen as a safe investment. The state also lacked agencies capable of issuing bonds, until Governor [[James Sevier Conway|James Conway]] signed acts which chartered two banks during Arkansas's first legislative session, a State Bank and a Real Estate Bank. This system had contemporaries in many other states. The Real Estate Bank was to be privately owned by shareholders, but too few shareholders bought in, causing the state to fund both banks. A showdown on the state legislature floor ended with knives being drawn. President of the Real Estate Bank/Speaker of the Arkansas House John Wilson killed state legislator Joseph Anthony after Anthony offered a bill that criticized Wilson's management of the Real Estate Bank. Wilson was acquitted of murder but expelled from the legislature.<ref>Fletcher 1989, p. 54.</ref> Wilson was reelected in 1840, and later had to be restrained in another [[knife fight]].\n\nIn 1836, Arkansas was to be the recipient of funds from the Deposit and Distribution Act, rumored by some to be as much as $1 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1|1836|r=2}}}} million in today's dollars).<ref>Worley 1949, p. 185.</ref> A very important sources of seed money for the State Bank; the program encountered a harsh recession that limited its effectiveness. Treasurer [[William E. Woodruff (politician)|William Woodruff]] had trouble cashing the first two installments of $45,583.83 and $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|45583.83|1836|r=-3}}}} and ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1836|r=-3}}}} today) at the two banks in [[Natchez, Mississippi]] due to a [[bank run]].<ref>Worley 1949, p. 186.</ref> Since the deposits were going to a state bank, the cash-strapped banks couldn't simply borrow the money from the state of Arkansas.<ref>Worley 1949, p. 187.</ref> Woodruff traveled to [[Washington D.C.]], where he received replacement drafts on [[Louisiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Ohio]] banks from [[United States Treasurer]] [[John Campbell (US Treasurer)|John Campbell]], but encountered the same troubles in those states.<ref>Worley 1949, p. 188.</ref>\n\nThe problems Woodruff was encountering would become known as the [[Panic of 1837]], a recession that took many years to recover from. Arkansas would only receive $45,583.83 of federal money, the amount of the first check which was ultimately settled by the Natchez banks.<ref>Worley 1949, p. 190.</ref> While Woodruff was trying to acquire the Distribution Act funds, the Arkansas State Banks had opened in Arkansas Post, Batesville, Fayetteville, Little Rock, and Washington and had been loaning money based on the notes given to Woodruff from various other states.<ref>Worley 1964, p. 67.</ref> Further, the bonds issued by the banks were not selling as anticipated, leaving the institutions without much of their anticipated seed money.<ref>Worley 1964, p. 71.</ref> Both banks would fail within a decade, with the bonds they had issued becoming entangled in legally questionable deals. Eventually the bonds fell into the hands of [[London]] banker James Holford, and they would come to be known as the \"[[Holford Bonds]]\", valued at $1,239,526.82 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.2395|1858|r=3}}}} million today) in 1858.<ref>Worley 1964, pp. 73.</ref> The issue of whether or not the bonds were a legitimate state debt and whether or not they would be repaid would be a political issue in the state throughout the 1800s.<ref>Worley 1964, pp. 71\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Mexican War===\n{{See also|Arkansas Militia and the War with Mexico}}\n[[File:Original Courthouse at Historic Washington State Park IMG 1481.JPG|thumb|[[Historic_Washington_State_Park#Major_buildings|Hempstead Court House]]]]\nArkansas played a key role in aiding Texas in its war for independence with Mexico, sending troops and materials to Texas to help fight the war. The proximity of the city of [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] to the Texas border involved the town in the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1835\u201336. Some evidence suggests [[Sam Houston]] and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at Washington in 1834.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasmediaroom.com/news-releases/listings/display.asp?id=165|title=Old Washington State Park Conserves Town's Heyday|first=Jim|last=Taylor|access-date=2007-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909034934/http://www.arkansasmediaroom.com/news-releases/listings/display.asp?id=165|archive-date=2007-09-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> When the fighting began a stream of volunteers from Arkansas and the eastern states flowed through the town toward the Texas battlefields.\n\nWhen the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] began in 1846, Washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops. Governor [[Thomas S. Drew|Thomas Drew]] issued a proclamation calling on the state to furnish one regiment of cavalry and one battalion of infantry to join the United States Army. Ten companies of men assembled here where they were formed into the first Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry.\n\n===Late antebellum period===\nThe young state began to show its first signs of improving beyond a frontier wilderness in the 1850s. The growing need for cotton gave many Arkansans an avenue to become involved in market economy for the first time, a transition that made the state significantly more prosperous. At the time, the most efficient way to grow cotton was a plantation-style system, and this quickly became the norm in the southeast part of Arkansas. During the late antebellum period, most Arkansans were identified with farming and ranching. Fewer worked as carpenters, blacksmiths, gunsmiths, and wagon builders and fewer still as lawyers, doctors, and teachers. This economic shift also allowed some Arkansans to work outside the factory or field as artisans, including James Black who is credited with creating the first [[Bowie Knife]] in Arkansas during the period. Improving transportation also helped the state's economy grow. The [[Southwest Trail]] and [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] were major roads in the state, and steamboats began using the state's rivers for commerce. Arkansas increased its cotton production from {{convert|6000000|lbs|kg}} in 1840 to {{convert|26000000|lbs|kg}} in 1850.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, pp. 140\u2013141.</ref> Arkansas and the southeast grew rapidly due to cotton, but its use of the plantation system would ultimately set the state and region behind the rest of the nation for decades.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, p. 135.</ref> Southeast Arkansas became significantly more prosperous than the northwestern highlands, causing a rift to form between the two regions.\n\n[[File:Henry Massey Rector.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Henry Massey Rector|Henry Rector]]]]\nAlthough the slave issue had been tabled following the Missouri Compromise, it again came to the forefront when [[California]]'s admission to the Union threatened the political balance between free and slave states. [[John Selden Roane|John Roane]], [[William K. Sebastian|William Sebastian]], [[Solon Borland]], and [[Robert Ward Johnson|Robert Johnson]] began rallying support for the Southern cause in Arkansas, including discussing secession. However, most Arkansans were looking to compromise and preserve the Union. After the [[Compromise of 1850]], several Family members in favor of secession acquired political office, including [[Elias Conway]] as governor. [[Thomas Hindman]], a lawyer from [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] and strong supporter of Southern rights, acquired the congressional seat in Arkansas's northern district with the support of the Family.<ref>Ferguson 1965, p. 4.</ref> Hindman would later side with [[Henry Massey Rector|Henry Rector]] against the Family, and both were successful in 1860.<ref>Ferguson 1965, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> During this time, the nation was continuing to grapple with the slavery issue. The [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] decision and [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]] kept slavery in the news. The creation of a Republican party who wanted to restrict the spread of slavery gave abolitionists a new option at the polls.\n\n[[Abraham Lincoln]] was elected President in 1860 when Rector became the first governor from outside the Family. Although Arkansans were leery of Lincoln, they were unsure of Rector's position with regard to secession.<ref>Ferguson 1965, p. 13.</ref><ref>Dougan 1976, p. 35.</ref> Hindman, Johnson, and [[Edward Gantt]] continued to advocate the Southern rights cause along with those loyal to the Family.<ref>Ferguson 1965, p. 15.</ref> [[South Carolina]] voted to secede in December 1860, and Hindman called for a secession vote, a move backed by Rector.<ref>Ferguson 1965, p. 19.</ref> The governor also forced the surrender of the garrison in Little Rock after rumors of Lincoln reinforcing the outfit.<ref>Dougan 1965, pp. 41\u201342.</ref> A vote in February 1861 showed Arkansas in favor of a convention on secession but the elected delegates voted to remain in the Union.<ref name=\"b22\">Bolton 1999, p. 22</ref> The convention was close but favored the Union, mirroring the demographics of Arkansas.<ref name=\"b22\" /> Northwest Arkansas was mostly pro-Union and had a slight population majority, and the southeast primarily in favor of secession.<ref>Ferguson 1965, p. 23.</ref>\n\nPresident Lincoln demanded troops be sent, including some Arkansans, to quell the rebellion following the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]] on April 4, 1861. Governor Rector denied the request and ordered troops the state militia to take Fort Smith from federal control.<ref>Dougan 1965, p. 61.</ref> Secession was again put to a vote at the state convention on May 6. Given the recent events, less than 10% of the delegates voted to remain in the Union.<ref>Dougan 1965, p. 62.</ref> Chairman David Walker requested another vote in the interest of obtaining a unanimous decision. Only [[Isaac Murphy]] cast a ballot against secession for the second vote, officially ending Arkansas's membership in the Union.<ref name=\"b22\" />\n\n==Civil War and Reconstruction==\n\n===Secession and Civil War===\n{{Main|Arkansas in the American Civil War}}\n{{See also|List of Arkansas Civil War Confederate units|Arkansas Militia in the Civil War|List of Arkansas Union Civil War Units|Book:Arkansas Confederate Infantry Units}}\n[[File:Hempstead Rifles.jpg|thumb|Officers and men of the Hempstead Rifles are [[Muster (military)|mustered in]] at [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]]]]\nSupport for the Southern cause was great immediately following secession. Many towns sent enthusiastic men with hunting rifles to Little Rock prepared to fight. Citizens across the state thought victory over the lazy Northerners would come swiftly. Some anti-war organizations formed in northwest Arkansas such as the Arkansas Peace Society, but members of these groups were usually arrested and charged with treason or forced to join Confederate ranks. Geographically Arkansas was a very important state during the war, giving the Rebels control of the Mississippi River and tenuous holds on Missouri, Louisiana and Indian Territory to the west. [[Benjamin McCulloch]] was ordered to defend north Arkansas and Indian Territory; however he elected to lead his troops in to Missouri in support of Maj. Gen. [[Sterling Price]]'s Missouri State Guard, leading to the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] near [[Springfield, Missouri]]. This bloody battle shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and painless victory for the South.\n\nOnce it became apparent to Arkansans and the nation that the war would not be a quick and painless proposition, excitement began to temper. Unpopular Confederate programs like higher taxes and a draft from which one could be exempted from by owning 20 or more slaves became major issues for civilians in addition to the Confederate soldiers losing battles such as the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862. Casualties were high for both sides at the [[Battle of Shiloh]], a function of better rifles, but also poor battlefield medicine. Both sides battled disease, poor nutrition, and transportation issues throughout the war.\n\n[[File:Battle of Pea Ridge.png|thumb|left|[[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in March 1862]]\nThe Union began an offensive across Arkansas in early 1862 in which General [[Samuel Curtis]] led troops near [[Leetown, Arkansas|Leetown]], where the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] occurred. After securing a Union victory, Curtis swept across the state to [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena]]. Curtis intended to knock Arkansas out of the war by capturing Little Rock. However, reinforcements arrived in Spring 1862 under General [[William Steele (general)|William Steele]]. General [[Thomas C. Hindman]], although recently defeated at the [[Battle of Cotton Plant]], attempted to return northwest Arkansas to Confederate control. The [[Battle of Prairie Grove]] was essentially a stalemate, but Hindman's unit withdrew to [[Van Buren, Arkansas|Van Buren]] and was driven from the region completely by December 1862. Union troops defeated a Confederate attack in the Battle of Fayetteville on April 18, 1863, but a week later abandoned Northwest Arkansas and retreated to Missouri for the summer.<ref>Mahan, Russell L. Fayetteville, Arkansas, in the Civil War. Historical Byways, Bountiful, Utah, 2003.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Fort Hindman.png|thumb|[[Battle of Arkansas Post (1863)|Bombardment and capture of Fort Hindman]] at [[Arkansas Post]] in 1863]]\nThe war began to turn against the Confederates in 1863, losing at the [[Battle of Helena]] despite a coordinated attack by generals [[Theophilus H. Holmes]], [[Sterling Price]], [[John S. Marmaduke]], and [[James Fleming Fagan]]. The [[Siege of Vicksburg]] concluded as a Union victory the same day, severely compromising the Rebels' control of the Mississippi River. Later in the year the Union used the post at Helena to capture [[Battle of Little Rock|Little Rock]], forcing the Confederate government to relocate, with the state archives, to [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]]. Despite controlling the state capitol, the Union hold on the state was tenuous. Guerrilla warfare ravaged the countryside and small towns throughout the war.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, p. 200.</ref> Bands of guerrillas often stole from houses and burned fields wherever the Union or Confederate armies were not present.\n\nThe last major fighting within the state occurred during the [[Camden Expedition]] (March 23 \u2013 May 2, 1864). The expedition was a military campaign in southern and central Arkansas which involved Union forces stationed at Little Rock and Fort Smith under the command of Major General Frederick Steele. The plan called for Steele's force to march to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], where it would link up with an amphibious expedition led by Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and Rear Admiral [[David Dixon Porter|David D. Porter]], whose force was to advance up the Red River Valley. Once joined, the Union force was to strike into Texas. But the two pincers never converged, and Steele's columns suffered terrible losses in a series of battles with Confederate forces led by Maj. Gen. [[Sterling Price]] and Gen. [[Edmund Kirby Smith]].\n\n[[File:Battle of Mine Creek.gif|thumb|240px|left|The ''Price Raid'' by [[Samuel J. Reader]]]]\nThe victory by Confederates in the Red River Campaign and its Arkansas segment, the Camden Expedition, opened a brief window of opportunity for Arkansas Confederates. Missouri General Joseph Shelby was dispatched to northeast Arkansas with his cavalry brigade and began recruiting. Throughout the summer of 1864, Confederate strength in northeast Arkansas steadily grew with many men who had either deserted from their previous commands or become separated, returning to Confederate Service. The last formation of new Confederate units occurred during this time with the formation of the 45th through the 48th Arkansas Mounted Infantry units.<ref>Sellmeyer, Deryl P.: \"Jo Shelby's Iron Brigade\", Pelican Publishing Company, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-58980-430-2}}, page 184</ref> Several existing Arkansas units were converted to Mounted Infantry and dispatched to northeast Arkansas. Shelby was eventually able to seriously threaten vital Union lines of communication along the Arkansas River between Helena and Little Rock, and for a while it appeared that Confederates would mount a serious attempt to retake the Capitol in Little Rock. However, Confederate authorities in Richmond were pressuring General Kirby Smith to dispatch some of his infantry to reinforce Confederate armies east of the Mississippi. This caused uproar with the Arkansas Confederate infantry units and as a compromise, General Smith approved a plan by Major General Sterling Price to organize a large-scale raid into Missouri that would coincide with the November 1864 Presidential Elections.<ref>Suderow, Bryce A. \"Pt 1 Natl.

Some planters moved south to [[Brazil]] during the war, including Arkansans. Congress passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] that stated if their master was fighting for the South; a slave could gain freedom by crossing behind Union lines. Following the Union victory at the [[Battle of Antietam]], the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] defined the impetus of further fighting to be slavery. This kept the [[United Kingdom]] out of the war, who were rumored to ready to help the Confederate cause but did not want to be viewed as promoting slavery. Many slaves sought freedom in the North, but arrived only to work on plantations for meager wages since cotton was still an important commodity.\n\n===Reconstruction Era===\n{{See also|Reconstruction Era|Arkansas Militia in Reconstruction|Brooks\u2013Baxter War}}\n[[File:Mustered out, harper's weekly, little rock, AR.jpg|thumb|A drawing of [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]] [[Muster (military)|mustered out]] at [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], 1866.]]\nFollowing the war, the Southern economy was in shambles, including Arkansas. The cost of the war effort, loss of [[human capital]], and Confederate currency losing value were serious issues for the south in addition to the destruction of property, infrastructure, and crops. Emancipated blacks also rushed out of the south following the war. [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s moderate [[ten percent plan]] allowed the Confederate states to return once 10% of their 1860 voters pledged allegiance to the United States and [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]]. A constitutional convention elected [[Isaac Murphy]] provisional governor, the lone vote against secession in the 1861 convention. Confederate loyalists quickly labeled Murphy as a traitor and compromised his effectiveness. Arkansas's two senators [[Elisha Baxter]] and [[William Fishback]] were denied seating in Washington by the Radical Republicans who thought Lincoln's policies were too lenient. Confederate governor [[Harris Flanagin]] brought state documents back from Washington and retired after the war. The [[Arkansas Constitution]] was redrawn in 1864 with the provisions necessitated by the 10% plan. When Lincoln was shot April 15, 1865, the hopes of a painless restoration of the Union died as well.\n\nThe southeast Arkansas planters tried several avenues to maintain cotton production despite emancipation. The system of [[sharecropping]] eventually became most popular, allowing individuals to use farmland, seed, tools and a dwelling provided by the landowner. At season end he received a share of the crop (which in turn was used to pay off local merchants who had provided credit for living expenses.) The duty of supervising these contracts between newly freed slaves and planters was  the responsibility of the federal [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands|Freedman's Bureau]]. Many plantation owners despised paying the same slaves that had run off from their plantation years earlier. Blacks began using their own schools and churches for the first time. Following the frustrations of losing the war and slavery, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) became the military arm of the Democratic party in much of the south, including Arkansas. Tasked with keeping blacks as well as white Republicans on plantations and away from the polls, the KKK and other groups like the [[Bald Knobbers]] reigned terror throughout the state for years.\n\nPresident [[Andrew Johnson]] granted pardons to many leading Confederates. The Confederate veterans in Arkansas formed a conservative political party to oppose the Unionists, lead at first by [[Augustus Hill Garland|Augustus Garland]]. The strong anti-Unionist feelings in the state were evident when Arkansas voters refused to ratify the 14th amendment, guaranteeing citizenship, due process, and equal protection to freedmen, and in fact passed laws restricting freedmen. Once it became clear the South would not return to the Union easily, the [[Reconstruction era of the United States#Military reconstruction|Military Reconstruction Act]] was passed in 1867. Arkansas became a military territory under General [[Edward Ord]].<ref>Herndon 1922, p. 110.</ref>\n\n[[File:OldMainUofA.jpg|thumb|[[University of Arkansas]], founded by the [[Arkansas General Assembly|General Assembly]] in 1868, is one of many public universities in the state.]]\nGeneral Ord kept Governor Murphy in power but dissolved the state legislature. Republicans called a convention in Little Rock in April 1867 in order to discuss how Arkansas could return to the Union. Freedmen began to participate in politics through organizations such as the [[Union League]], including registering blacks for the upcoming election. The election selected seventy delegates to a constitutional convention, composed primarily of [[Radical Republicans]]. The resulting constitution gave blacks full citizenship, due process, and the right to vote, as well as free public schools for all races and the establishment of the [[University of Arkansas]]. The document infuriated many conservatives and many thought it was a partisan document created for the benefit of the Republicans. The new constitution was approved in a corrupt election that also gave many offices to the Republicans. Ord certified the results, as did Congress over the president's veto, and the new Arkansas assembly ratified the 14th amendment, allowing Arkansas to reenter the Union on June 22, 1868.\n\n[[Powell Clayton]], a Union general who had returned to live in Arkansas after the war, was elected governor in the corrupt 1868 election. Clayton took it upon himself to keep the Confederates out of power and protect the newly freed blacks. Many of his political appointments were from northern states, leading his opponents to paint him and his allies as [[carpetbagger]]s. In order to build Arkansas's infrastructure, Clayton raised taxes, another unpopular decision. Financial incentives were given to railroad companies, who ultimately laid {{convert|662|mi|km}} of track by the end of Reconstruction with $9 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|9000000|1875|r=3}}}} in current dollars) in state assistance.\n\nFollowing the 1868 election, many residents were frustrated by the radical Republicans that had taken control of most county offices. The KKK began [[whitecapping]] throughout Arkansas, and Governor Clayton declared [[martial law]] in ten counties, later adding four more. In [[Mississippi County, Arkansas|Mississippi County]], one of the martial law counties, a racially and politically charged event called the Black Hawk War took place in 1872 that is indicative of Reconstruction. County registrar Charles Fitzpatrick rode around with an armed group of blacks, collecting taxes and issuing threats to his opponents. Fitzpatrick accused Sheriff J. B. Murray of misappropriating county funds, and the allegation became a heated argument. When the two met to shake hands at the Osceola Post Office, Murray punched Fitzpatrick, who responded by shooting and killing Murray. Upon Fitzpatrick turning himself in, a trial was held but the judge adjourned the tense court for two days before ordering Fitzpatrick to disperse his company of 200 armed men. Fitzpatrick complied, and the judge went across town to disperse a crowd of KKK members, led by former Confederate Captain Charles Bowen. Both parties dispersed but ran into each other south of town and shots were fired. Fitzpatrick was never convicted and was nominated for the state legislature, but was defeated by Hiram McVeigh.\n\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:TroopsArkansasOldStateHouse.jpg|left|thumb|Baxter's troops gathered in front of the Old State House in Downtown Little Rock, this image is actually inaccurate; the split rail fence had been replaced by a wrought iron one by 1874]] -->\nThe 1872 gubernatorial election was also marked by fraud and corruption. In 1874, the [[Brooks-Baxter War]] shook [[Little Rock]]. The dispute about the legal governor of the state was settled when President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered that [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]] to disperse his militant supporters.\n\n==Growth and industrialization==\n{{Main|The New South}}\n[[File:Augustus Hill Garland - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Augustus Hill Garland|Augustus Garland]]]]\nWhen Congress voted to approve [[Augustus Hill Garland|Augustus Garland]] as governor a year after a corrupt 1874 election, Arkansas and other Southern states began to envision a revolution in which the old Confederate states could update their economies using Northern capital and industry to replace plantation agriculture. Contemporary Arkansans also believed cultural and social change could come with this transition.<ref>Moneyhon 1997, p. 4.</ref> Although changes did take place, the state suffered from agrarian revolt, segregation, public corruption, resistance to change and disfranchisement instead of benefiting from a new diversified economy.<ref>{{harvp|\"Johnson III\"|2019|p= 6}}.</ref>\n\nThe \"New South\" progressive ideals were especially evident in the era's business leaders such as [[Robert E.

Their migration out of the South was a reach toward a better quality of life where they could vote and live more fully as citizens. Agricultural changes also meant that farm workers were not needed in as great number. Thousands left Arkansas. During the years of [[World War II]], blacks also migrated to the coastal communities in the [[Western United States]], where good jobs were expanding in defense industries.\n\n===Discontent and reform===\n{{See also|History of agriculture in the United States#Railroad age: 1860\u20131910|American farm discontent}}\n[[File:Arkansas1895.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rand McNally]] map of Arkansas, 1895]]\nWhite farmers in Arkansas were devastated following the war, and a combination of forces aligned to further depress the agriculture sector.

The group became the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populists]] in 1890. During the late 1880s and 1890s, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] worked to consolidate their power and prevent alliances among African Americans and poor whites in the years of agricultural depression. They were facing competition from the new Populist and other third parties. In 1891, state legislators passed a statute requiring a [[literacy test]] for voter registration, when more than 25% of the population could not read or write. In 1892 the state passed a constitutional amendment that imposed a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and associated residency requirements for voting, which combined barriers sharply reduced the numbers of blacks and poor whites on the voter rolls, and voter participation dropped sharply.<ref name=\"oldstatehouse.com\">{{ cite web |url= http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news |title= \"White Primary\" System Bars Blacks from Politics - 1900 |publisher= The Arkansas News |date= Spring 1987 |page= 3 |location= Little Rock, AR |accessdate= March 22, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080503211520/http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/ |archive-date= May 3, 2008 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nWith the right to suffrage, freedmen began to participate vigorously in the political life of the state.

Governor [[Orval Faubus]] deployed the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to support the segregationists, and only backed down after Judge [[Ronald Davies (judge)|Ronald Davies]] of [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas|U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas]] granted an injunction from the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] compelling him to withdraw the Guard.<ref>Graeme Cope, \"'A Thorn in the Side'?

Little Rock's four public high schools were closed in September 1958, only reopening a year later. Integration across all grades was finally achieved in fall 1972. The Little Rock school episode drew international attention to the troubled state of race relations in the United States.<ref>Mary L.

This document, titled '119 countries... 6.6 million players' adds the number of registered and unregistered players reported by each country. Some unions only report their registered players, i.e. those who play for an affiliated club or region. Other unions, such as England's [[Rugby Football Union]], also report people taking part in outreach and educational programs, or unregistered players. In the 2012 figures reported by the RFU they reported 1,990,988 people playing rugby in England, including 1,102,971 under 13s, 731,685 teens and 156,332 seniors. Some of those recorded would have experienced rugby via educational visits to schools, playing tag or touch rugby, rather than playing regularly for a club. The figures released in 2014 give an overall figure of those playing rugby union, or one of its variants, as 6,684,118, but also reports that of that total, 3.36 million are registered players, while 4.3 million are unregistered.</ref>\n| clubs = 180,630\n| contact = [[Full-contact|Full contact]]\n| team = 15 (with up to 8 substitutes)\n| mgender = Separate competitions\n| category = [[Team sport]], Outdoor\n| equipment = [[Football (ball)#Rugby union|Rugby ball]], [[Scrum cap]] (optional), [[Cleat (shoe)|Rugby boots]]\n| venue =\n| olympic = Part of the Summer Olympic programme in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]]<br />[[Rugby sevens]] included in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]\n}}\n\n'''Rugby union''', widely known simply as '''rugby''', is a [[Contact sport#Terminology|full contact]] [[team sport]] that originated in [[England]] in the first half of the 19th century. One of the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes]] of [[rugby football]], is based on running with the ball in hand.  In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players using an [[Rugby ball|oval-shaped ball]] on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.\n\nRugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. Rugby is the only full contact sport for females, and the [[Rugby_union#Laws|rules]] do not differ between genders. In 2014, there were more than 6 million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36 million were registered players. [[World Rugby]], previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members.\n\nIn 1845, the first football laws were written by pupils at [[Rugby School]]; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by [[Blackheath F.C.]] to leave [[the Football Association]] in 1863 and, in 1895, the acrimonious [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|split]] between the then amateur rugby union and the professional [[rugby league]].  Historically rugby union was an amateur sport, but in 1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scianitti|first=Matthew|title=The world awaits for Canada's rugby team|url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team|accessdate=8 March 2020|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=18 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130129194424/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRugby union spread from the [[Home Nations]] of Great Britain and Ireland and was embraced by many of the countries associated with the [[British Empire]].

The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum.

Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialise as line-out jumpers.<ref name=\"IRB BGRU 6\"/> The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side.

country, by age and sex to publish instead an overall figure per country. This document, titled '119 countries... 6.6 million players' adds the number of registered and unregistered players reported by each country. Some unions only report their registered players, i.e. those who play for an affiliated club or region. Other unions, such as England's [[Rugby Football Union]], also report people taking part in outreach and educational programs, or unregistered players. In the 2012 figures reported by the RFU they reported 1,990,988 people playing rugby in England, including 1,102,971 under 13s, 731,685 teens and 156,332 seniors. Some of those recorded would have experienced rugby via educational visits to schools, playing tag or touch rugby, rather than playing regularly for a club. The figures released in 2014 give an overall figure of those playing rugby union, or one of its variants, as 6,684,118, but also reports that of that total, 3.36 million are registered players, while 4.3 million are unregistered.</ref>\n| clubs = 180,630\n| contact = [[Full-contact|Full contact]]\n| team = 15 (with up to 8 substitutes)\n| mgender = Separate competitions\n| category = [[Team sport]], Outdoor\n| equipment = [[Football (ball)#Rugby union|Rugby ball]], [[Scrum cap]] (optional), [[Cleat (shoe)|Rugby boots]]\n| venue =\n| olympic = Part of the Summer Olympic programme in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]]<br />[[Rugby sevens]] included in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]\n}}\n\n'''Rugby union''', widely known simply as '''rugby''', is a [[Contact sport#Terminology|full contact]] [[team sport]] that originated in [[England]] in the first half of the 19th century. One of the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes]] of [[rugby football]], is based on running with the ball in hand.  In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players using an [[Rugby ball|oval-shaped ball]] on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.\n\nRugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. Rugby is the only full contact sport for females, and the [[Rugby_union#Laws|rules]] do not differ between genders. In 2014, there were more than 6 million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36 million were registered players. [[World Rugby]], previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members.\n\nIn 1845, the first football laws were written by pupils at [[Rugby School]]; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by [[Blackheath F.C.]] to leave [[the Football Association]] in 1863 and, in 1895, the acrimonious [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|split]] between the then amateur rugby union and the professional [[rugby league]].  Historically rugby union was an amateur sport, but in 1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scianitti|first=Matthew|title=The world awaits for Canada's rugby team|url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team|accessdate=8 March 2020|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=18 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130129194424/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRugby union spread from the [[Home Nations]] of Great Britain and Ireland and was embraced by many of the countries associated with the [[British Empire]].

Although these clubs decided to ban hacking soon afterwards, the split was permanent, and [[Laws of the Game (association football)|the FA's codified rules]] became known as \"[[association football]]\" whilst the clubs that had favoured the Rugby Rules formed the [[Rugby Football Union]] in 1871,<ref name=\"Godwin10\"/> and their code became known as \"rugby football\".\n\nIn 1895, there was [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|a major schism within rugby football]] in England in which numerous clubs from Northern England resigned from the RFU over the issue of reimbursing players for time lost from their workplaces. The split highlighted the social and class divisions in the sport in England, and led directly to the creation of the separate code of \"[[rugby league]]\".

The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum.

Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialise as line-out jumpers.<ref name=\"IRB BGRU 6\"/> The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side.

Earlier, it was the centre of '''Torgay Region''', which was abolished in 1997. Today, it is the administrative centre of Torgay District, Kostanay Region. \nEstablished in 1956, it acquired the status of the city in 1965.

Population: {{Kz-census2009|28,169|punct=;}}{{Kz-census1999|45,736|punct=.}}\n\nThe Arkalyk Business Centre describes today's Arkalyk as \"a city of miners, of regional administrators, and people excited to live in a regional center\". Historically Arkalyk was a centre for the Soviet space programme. Cosmonauts would land on the huge central Kazakh steppe and come back to Arkalyk before heading to the [[Baikonur]], the Soviet Union's premier \"space city\".  Arkalyk is served by [[Arkalyk Airport]].\n\nThe city is linked by rail communication with the regional center (terminal station on a branch Esil - Derzhavinsk - Arkalyk). Roads Kostanay - Arkalyk tarmac, but is severely broken in the state. Roads Zhezkazgan - Arkalyk ground, in the wet weather becomes difficult even for freight transport because of mud. There is an airport (located 6 kilometers north-east of the city), capable of class aircraft Tu-154, Tu-134, etc. In Soviet times, it carried out flights to many cities in Kazakhstan, but since the mid-1990s an airport has been  practically abandoned and used only sporadically during the search and rescue for the planting of manned spaceaids.\n\n==History==\nArkalyk was founded in 1956 as a settlement of geologists and builders. By birth, it was obliged to open after the war for deposits of bauxite (raw material for aluminum production). On May 17, 1956, in a joint decree of the CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers a separate line was written: \u00abOn the basis of Amangeldy bauxite deposits construct and put into operation Torghay bauxite mines \u00bb. In the 1960s Arkalyk was declared the All-Union shock Komsomol building, there was the young people flock from all over the USSR. In 1965 Arkalyk received city status and in 1971 became the center of the newly created Torghay area. \n\nIn the 1980s the city reached its peak: it produced meat, poultry, and dairy. It functioned grain elevator, ceramic factory, sewing factory, the factory radio, factory built Aviamotornaya, Turgay bauxite mine (TBRU), which extracted up to 20% of bauxite ores in the USSR. But despite the industrial production, the economy of [[Torgay Region]] was behind other regions of Kazakhstan due to large agricultural sector which was 90%. The region constantly demanded subsidies from the national budget, so in June 1988 it was dissolved and its territory was divided between Kostanai and Aqmola areas. When the city stopped to be a regional center, some parts of the infrastructure was evacuated (for example, regional radio station), and a number of potential industrial sites was frozen. \n\nIn 1989, active inhabitants of Arkalyk organized committee to restore Torgay Region. In August 1990, Torgay Region was re-established, and Arkalyk become the regional center again.\n\nDegradation of the city began in 1993-1994: production fell into decay. Migration began to other regions of Kazakhstan, Russia and Germany. Consequently, population of the city reduced. In 1991 it was 65,000 people, in 1999 it was 45,000, now it is 23,000 people. During 90s there were disrupted public services such as lengthy interruption of electricity, heat and water. In 1997, Turgay area has been disbanded again, and its territory was again moved into Kostanai and Akmola areas. \n\nSome of the city districts as a part of #6, all of #7 and #9 were completely abandoned by the 2000s. Migration from the city was a complicated process which started in 90s. Full optimization stopped in 2000\u20132001. Enterprising businessmen from other regions of Kazakhstan dismantled the houses by removing building materials. \n\nAt the turn of 20th and 21st century, local authorities organized a campaign to relocate the remaining residents from the abandoned districts to the older city center, so the cost for municipal services would be reduced and communication would be significantly improved.\n\nCurrently, the city of Arkalyk is included in the list of depressed cities of Kazakhstan due to a very high level of unemployment. Industry in the city is virtually non-existent, except for maintaining the life of city and Torgayskogo bauxite mine, which is housed in SC \u00abAluminum of Kazakhstan\u00bb. All produced bauxiteore is sent to the aluminum plant in Pavlodar, and other regions. Establishment of an aluminum smelter in Arkalyk is difficult due to lack of water.\n\nProspectives of Arkalyk are dual. On the one hand, the town has the bauxite mine which over the next 15\u201320 years will exhaust deposits and it will be possible to extract refractory clay only. On the other hand, there are a number of other minerals such as Jean-Arkalykskoe field has the shallow bed (up to 50 meters); Akzhalskoe field nefritoidov has the jewelry and raw materials; Akbulakskoe field has white marble; Agyrzhalskoe field has black marble; Jean-Arkalykskoe has deposits of therapeutic mineral waters. Development of these fields could lead to the economic and social revival of the region.\n\n==Climate==\nIn Arkalyk, the climate is cold and temperate. There is more rainfall in winter than in summer. The K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification is Dfa. The average annual temperature in Arkalyk is {{convert|4.5|\u00b0C|1}}.

The radius of {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city are extensive mining (related to mining bauxite ore), the depth of 20\u201350 m. \n\nThe natural reservoirs are not numerous, except for two drying creeks Akjar (in the northern part of town) and Arkalyksay (in the southern part of town), running from the East to the West.\n\n==The natural wealth of the city==\n\nNear the town of Arkalyk is 6 bauxite for the aluminum industry. This Arkalyk, Lower Ashut, Ushtobe, Northern, Upper Ashut and Aktas. These same deposits associated classes of refractory clay. In addition, the bauxite, the associated component is gallium, stocks of which is formed by 761 kilograms. At the distance of {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city there is another lead field \"Jana-Arkalyk\" under exploration. Among the associated components of the ore we can find yttrium, gold, silver, tin, and others. The reserves of Jana-Arkalyk deposit are estimated at 6 million tons of lead. In the same area there are 37 fields common minerals including 28-brick commodity, 4-building stone, construction sand 5. {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city there is Akzhal deposit of nephritis, which was mined in 1997 for extraction purposes of decorative facing stone. Within the radius of 70\u2013100&nbsp;km away from the city there are deposits with an estimated volume of 3-6 million cubic metres of White Akbulak Marble and deposits of Agirjal black marble with reserves of about 8 million cubic metres.

They are separated by small rivers, which sometimes form deep valleys.\n* In the South there is the [[Danube]] valley, very wide, with ponds and small channels.\n\nBeside the [[Danube]], the main river crossing the county is the [[Olt River]] which flows into the [[Danube]] close to the village of [[Islaz]]. Other important rivers are: the [[Vedea River]], the [[Teleorman River]] and the [[C\u0103lm\u0103\u021bui River (Teleorman)|C\u0103lm\u0103\u021bui River]].\n\n===Neighbours===\n\n*[[Giurgiu County]] in the East.\n*[[Olt County]] in the West.\n*[[Arge\u0219 County]] and [[D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba County]] in the North.\n*[[Bulgaria]] in the South - [[Veliko Tarnovo Province]], [[Pleven Province]] and [[Ruse Province]].\n\n{{Romanian counties map|width=250px}}\n\n==Economy==\nThe predominant industries in the county are:\n* Food and beverages industry.\n* Textile industry.\n* Chemical industry.\n* Mechanical components industry - in [[Alexandria, Romania|Alexandria]] there is a big roll-bearing enterprise.\n\nAgriculture is the main occupation in the county. Both extensive agriculture, and small scale - vegetables and fruits for [[Bucharest]] markets, is practiced. The area is well suited for irrigations.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Antim Monastery - Arges, Teleorman, Mehedinti.png|thumb|right|100px|1715 coat of arms of [[Arge\u0219 County|Arge\u0219]], Teleorman and [[Mehedin\u021bi County|Mehedin\u021bi]] counties on the frontispice of the [[Antim Monastery]]]]\nThe county doesn't have many spectacular attractions, but its cultural folk heritage is very rich. Many Romanian personalities have been born here, some of them later describing the life in a village in a very picturesque way. Also, the area was one of the places where the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]] unfolded.\n\nThe main tourist destinations are:\n* The city of [[Alexandria, Romania|Alexandria]].\n* Fishing on the [[Danube]] and other lakes or ponds.\n\n==Politics==\nThe Teleorman County Council, elected at the [[2016 Romanian local election|2016 local government elections]], is made up of 33 counselors, with

In the North side there is the [[Transylvanian Plateau]].\n\nThe most important rivers crossing the county are the [[Olt River|Olt]] in the South with [[Cibin River|Cibin]] its main effluent, and the [[T\u00e2rnava River|T\u00e2rnava]] in the North.\n\n===Neighbours===\n\n{{Romanian counties map}}\n*[[Bra\u0219ov County]] in the East.\n*[[Alba County]] in the West.\n*[[Mure\u0219 County]] in the North.\n*[[V\u00e2lcea County]] in the South.\n*[[Arge\u015f County]] in the South-East.\n\n==Economy==\nSibiu County has one of the most dynamic economies in [[Romania]], and is one of the regions with the highest level of foreign investment.\n\nThe predominant industries in the county are:\n* Machine and [[automotive components]].\n* [[Food industry]].\n* [[Textile industry]].\n* [[Wood industry]].\n\nThe biggest natural resource in the county is [[natural gas]], especially in the north side, having one of the largest sources in the country.\n\nIn [[Cop\u0219a Mic\u0103]] during the [[Communist Romania|communist period]] there were [[Cop\u0219a Mic\u0103 works|two chemical industrial complexes]] which polluted the environment heavily with [[carbon black]], heavy metals, and other chemical substances. The area is still considered one of the most polluted communities in Europe. After 1989 many of the industrial complexes were shut down and the area is slowly recovering.\n\n==Politics==\nThe regional legislature is the County Council. Its president was [[Martin Bottesch]] ([[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]]) from 2004 to 2012.\n\nThe Sibiu County Council, elected at the [[2016 Romanian local election|2016 local government elections]], is made up of 33 counselors, with the following party composition:<ref name=\"LocalElections2016\">{{cite web|url=http://www.2016bec.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SIAL2016_CJ_mandate.xlsx|title=Mandate de CJ pe judete si competitori|publisher=Biroul Electoral Central|date=10 June 2016|accessdate=16 June 2016|language=Romanian}}</ref>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Party\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Seats\n! style=\"background:#ccc\" colspan=\"17\" | Current County Council\n|-\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | '''13'''\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PNL}} | &nbsp;\n|-\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | '''12'''\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/PSD}} | &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/FDGR}} | &nbsp;\n| [[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania|Democratic Forum of Germans]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | '''8'''\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/FDGR}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/FDGR}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/FDGR}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/FDGR}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/FDGR}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/FDGR}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/FDGR}} | &nbsp;\n| {{Romanian politics/party colours/FDGR}} | &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n|}\n\n==Tourism==\n\n[[File:Tilt_shift_Sibiu.jpg|thumb|[[Sibiu]] ({{lang-de|Hermannstadt}}, {{lang-hu|Nagyszeben}})]]\n[[File:Medgyes2.JPG|thumb|[[Media\u0219]] ({{lang-de|Mediasch}}, {{lang-hu|Medgyes}})]]\n\nThe main tourist attractions in the county are:\n*The city of [[Sibiu]] with its medieval fortifications and its historic centre.\n*The medieval city of [[Media\u0219]].\n*The medieval [[Transylvanian Saxon|Saxon]] fortified churches and villages from [[Transylvania]], some of them being [[Saxon villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]:\n**[[Biertan, Sibiu|Biertan]].\n**[[Valea Viilor]].\n**[[Cisn\u0103die]].\n**[[Cisn\u0103dioara, Sibiu|Cisn\u0103dioara]].\n**[[Slimnic]].\n**[[Agnita]].\n*The [[C\u00e2r\u021ba Monastery|abbey]] of [[C\u00e2r\u021ba, Sibiu|C\u00e2r\u021ba]]\n*The [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]].\n** The B\u00e2lea Valley and the [[Transf\u0103g\u0103r\u0103\u0219an]].\n** The [[Negoiu Peak]].\n*[[P\u0103ltini\u0219]] mountain resort and the [[Cindrel Mountains]].\n*[[Ocna Sibiului]], [[Bazna]] and [[Miercurea Sibiului]] [[Spa towns]].\n*The [[M\u0103rginimea Sibiului]] rural area.\n\n==People==\n* [[Emil Cioran]]\n* [[Octavian Goga]]\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{see also|List of settlements in Sibiu County}}\n[[File:Sibiu County administrative map.png|thumb|Administrative map of the county.]]\n\nSibiu County has 2 municipalities, 9 towns and 53 communes\n;Municipalities\n*[[Media\u0219]]\n*[[Sibiu]] - capital city;
