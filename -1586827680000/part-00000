It has a [[List of One-Punch Man chapters|manga adaptation]] illustrated by [[Yusuke Murata]], as well as an [[List of One-Punch Man episodes|anime adaptation]]. Following its publication, the webcomic quickly went [[viral phenomenon|viral]], surpassing 7.9&nbsp;million hits in June 2012. ''One-Punch Man'' tells the story of [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Saitama|Saitama]], a [[superhero]] who can defeat any opponent with a single punch but seeks to find a worthy opponent after growing bored by a lack of challenge in his fight against evil. Although OPM may engross you with its plot line, it is a comedy of a superhero that has no limit. While others break new barriers, OPM has no barriers as he has already broken his limiter.\n\nThe series' [[online magazine|digital]] [[manga]] remake began publication on [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Young Jump|Tonari no Young Jump]]'' website in 2012. The chapters are periodically collected and printed into ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. {{As of|2019|November}}, 20 volumes have been released, 17 of which have been republished in English. [[Viz Media]] has licensed the remake for English serialization in its ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump (American magazine)|Weekly Shonen Jump]]'' digital magazine. Its English release received a nomination for an [[Eisner Award]] in 2015 and a [[Harvey Award]] in 2016.\n\nAn [[anime]] television adaptation by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] aired in Japan between October and December 2015. It was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in English during the summer of 2016, and later that year a planned second season was announced. On September 25, 2017, it was announced the production company and director had changed. The second season was animated by [[J.C.Staff]] with Chikara Sakurai replacing Shingo Natsume as director and Yoshikazu Iwanami replacing Shoji Hata as sound director. The second season aired between April and July 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of One-Punch Man characters}}\nOn a supercontinent Earth, powerful monsters and villains have been wreaking havoc in the cities. To combat them, the millionaire Agoni creates the [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Hero Association|Hero Association]], which employs superheroes to stop them. [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Saitama|Saitama]], an unassociated hero, hails from the metropolis of City Z and performs heroic deeds for his own entertainment. He has trained himself to the point where he can effortlessly defeat any opponent with a single punch, becoming bored with his own omnipotence.\n\nOver the course of the series, Saitama encounters various superheroes, friends, villains, and monsters. He reluctantly becomes a mentor to [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Genos|Genos]], a cyborg who moves in with him and is seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his entire family and hometown. Saitama and Genos join the Hero Association. Saitama performs many feats that go mostly unnoticed and unappreciated by the public due to his low-entry rank.\n\nBefore she dies, the seer [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Shibabawa|Shibabawa]] has a vision that the world is in danger. The Hero Association calls all the top heroes to a meeting, begging them to protect the world. Immediately after the meeting, an alien named Boros invades the planet. The heroes fight the invaders outside Boros's ship, while Saitama finds Boros and defeats him.\n\nSaitama gradually begins to meet other superheroes such as the [[Martial arts|martial artist]] [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Bang|Bang]]; and [[List of One-Punch Man characters#King|King]], the \"Strongest Man on Earth\", who is actually a fraud quietly taking credit for Saitama's deeds. Growing increasingly aware of the rising rate of monster appearances, the Hero Association tries to recruit more heroes and even begins recruiting villains. When Hero Association executive [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Sitch|Sitch]] tries to do so, Bang's former apprentice [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Garo|Garo]] begins beating heroes left and right. Garo's ruthlessness earns him the title \"Hero Hunter\".\n\nSaitama enters a martial arts tournament disguised as [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Charanko|Charanko]], a disciple of Bang. During the tournament, the [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Monster Association|Monster Association]] attacks various cities, kidnaps the child of one of the Hero Association's executives, and recruits potential fighters by offering them \"monster cells\" that mutate them into monsters with extraordinary abilities. The Hero Association attempts a rescue of the kidnapped child.\n\n==Background and production==\nThe Japanese shortened name ''Wanpanman'' is a play on the long-running children's character ''[[Anpanman]]'',<ref name=\"Viz 1&2\" /> ''wanpan'' being a contraction of ''wanpanchi'' (\"one punch\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weblio.jp/content/%E3%83%AF%E3%83%B3%E3%83%91%E3%83%B3|title=weblio\u5b9f\u7528\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8868\u73fe\u8f9e\u5178|language=Japanese|trans-title=Weblio Practical Japanese Expression Dictionary|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109220642/http://www.weblio.jp/content/%E3%83%AF%E3%83%B3%E3%83%91%E3%83%B3#|archive-date=November 9, 2016|accessdate=May 14, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[webcomic]] version of ''One-Punch Man'' was created by [[One (manga artist)|One]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oppaihoodie.com/two-creators-original-manga-one-punch-man/ |title=Two Creators of the Original Manga One-Punch Man |accessdate=May 20, 2017 |website=Oppai Hoodie Blog |language=English |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805015018/https://www.oppaihoodie.com/two-creators-original-manga-one-punch-man/# |archive-date=August 5, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"web manga\" /> He became interested in creating a comic superhero who was already the strongest in the world.<ref name=\"web manga\" /><ref name=\"Archived copy\">{{Cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/anime/2017/11/28/one-punch-man-how-saitama-was-made/# |title='One Punch Man' Creator Reveals How He Created Saitama|website=ComicBook.com|first=Nick|last=Valdez |access-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026064418/https://comicbook.com/anime/2017/11/28/one-punch-man-how-saitama-was-made/# |archive-date=October 26, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He wanted to focus on different aspects of storytelling than those normally relied on in standard superhero stories, such as everyday problems.

Gone are the intricately detailed character action shots, with dynamic slow motion and constantly-shifting camerawork. Instead, we have flashes, cuts to black, and machine-gun punches all reminiscent of the drawn-out fight scenes of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' from more than twenty years ago.\" They concluded saying: \"Season 2 of ''One-Punch Man'' is a half-baked jumble of poor and lazy animation that is far more concerned with staying relevant than being crafted into something worthy of the season that came before it. If you're only in it for the advancement of the plot, it's all here.

This is almost certainly down to a change in director. [The series] has gone from the pinnacle of TV anime visuals to looking like just another weekly series.\" However, they believed the season \"improves in terms of story, character and world-building\", although they mostly attribute this to the original manga rather than the series' crew.<ref name=\"ScreenRantLooksWorse\"/> They were very critical of the season finale, noting:<blockquote>The absence of a major final battle can perhaps be forgiven, but the episode also fails to deliver any sort of major plot cliffhanger that builds excitement towards season 3<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://strawhatmanga.com/one-punch-man-season-3/|title=What Is The One Punch Man Season 3 Release Date?

The closing image of Phoenix Man flying Garou away to the Monster Association is far from a surprising development and manga readers will know that the ramifications of this scene aren't the main focus moving into season 3. ... ''One-Punch Man'' season 2's strange ending is even harder to understand considering the anime only needed to adapt one or two extra manga chapters to deliver a more definitive finale. The episode ends without giving any clear idea on the direction for season 3.<ref name=\"ScreenRantWeirdPlace\"/></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Anime and manga|Speculative fiction}}\n{{commons category|One Punch-Man}}\n* {{Official website|http://galaxyheavyblow.web.fc2.com/|Official website for original web manga}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{Official website|https://tonarinoyj.jp/episode/13932016480028985383|Manga official website}} at ''[[Young Jump|Young Jump Web Comic]]s'' {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{Official website|http://shonenjump.viz.com/one-punch-man|Manga official website}} at Viz Media's ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump (American magazine)|Weekly Shonen Jump]]'' website\n* {{Official website|http://onepunchman-anime.net/|Anime official website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.adultswim.com/videos/one-punch-man/|''One-Punch Man''}} at Adult Swim\n* {{ANN|manga|15076}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|tv/one_punch_man|One-Punch Man}}\n\n{{Madhouse}}\n{{J.C.Staff}}\n{{Toonami-anime}}\n\n[[Category:2009 webcomic debuts]]\n[[Category:Action anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Anime series based on manga]]\n[[Category:Crunchyroll]]\n[[Category:Comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Bandai Visual]]\n[[Category:Japanese webcomics]]\n[[Category:J.C.Staff]]\n[[Category:Madhouse (company)]]\n[[Category:One-Punch Man]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Shueisha franchises]]\n[[Category:Shueisha manga]]\n[[Category:Superheroes in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Superhero webcomics]]\n[[Category:Television programs based on Japanese webcomics]]\n[[Category:Toonami]]\n[[Category:TV Tokyo shows]]\n[[Category:Viz Media anime]]\n[[Category:Viz Media manga]]\n[[Category:Webcomics in print]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2015}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = <!-- DO NOT modify the title without forming consensus on the talk page--> One-Punch Man<!-- DO NOT modify the title without forming consensus on the talk page -->\n| image           = OnePunchMan manga cover.png\n| caption         = Cover of the first volume of the ''One-Punch Man'' [[manga]] adaptation by [[Yusuke Murata]] featuring Saitama with a slain monster in the background.\n| ja_kanji        = \u30ef\u30f3\u30d1\u30f3\u30de\u30f3\n| ja_romaji       = Wanpanman\n| genre           = <!-- Note: Use and cite reliable sources to identify genre/s, not personal interpretation.

Following its publication, the webcomic quickly went [[viral phenomenon|viral]], surpassing 7.9&nbsp;million hits in June 2012. ''One-Punch Man'' tells the story of [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Saitama|Saitama]], a [[superhero]] who can defeat any opponent with a single punch but seeks to find a worthy opponent after growing bored by a lack of challenge in his fight against evil.\n\nThe series' [[online magazine|digital]] [[manga]] remake began publication on [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Young Jump|Tonari no Young Jump]]'' website in 2012.

The second season aired between April and July 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of One-Punch Man characters}}\nOn a supercontinent Earth, powerful monsters and villains have been wreaking havoc in the cities. To combat them, the millionaire Agoni creates the [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Hero Association|Hero Association]], which employs superheroes to stop them. [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Saitama|Saitama]], an unassociated hero, hails from the metropolis of City Z and performs heroic deeds for his own entertainment. He has trained himself to the point where he can effortlessly defeat any opponent with a single punch, becoming bored with his own omnipotence.\n\nOver the course of the series, Saitama encounters various superheroes, friends, villains, and monsters. He reluctantly becomes a mentor to [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Genos|Genos]], a cyborg who moves in with him and is seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his entire family and hometown. Saitama and Genos join the Hero Association. Saitama performs many feats that go mostly unnoticed and unappreciated by the public due to his low-entry rank.\n\nBefore she dies, the seer [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Shibabawa|Shibabawa]] has a vision that the world is in danger. The Hero Association calls all the top heroes to a meeting, begging them to protect the world. Immediately after the meeting, an alien named Boros invades the planet. The heroes fight the invaders outside Boros's ship, while Saitama finds Boros and defeats him.\n\nSaitama gradually begins to meet other superheroes such as the [[Martial arts|martial artist]] [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Bang|Bang]]; and [[List of One-Punch Man characters#King|King]], the \"Strongest Man on Earth\", who is actually a fraud quietly taking credit for Saitama's deeds. Growing increasingly aware of the rising rate of monster appearances, the Hero Association tries to recruit more heroes and even begins recruiting villains. When Hero Association executive [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Sitch|Sitch]] tries to do so, Bang's former apprentice [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Garo|Garo]] begins beating heroes left and right. Garo's ruthlessness earns him the title \"Hero Hunter\".\n\nSaitama enters a martial arts tournament disguised as [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Charanko|Charanko]], a disciple of Bang. During the tournament, the [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Monster Association|Monster Association]] attacks various cities, kidnaps the child of one of the Hero Association's executives, and recruits potential fighters by offering them \"monster cells\" that mutate them into monsters with extraordinary abilities.

He was educated and trained in Europe, first working at the [[Mauritshuis]] in [[The Hague]] and at museums in [[Berlin]].\n\nIn 1907 he moved to the United States to become the first [[curator]] of the department of [[decorative arts]] in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum]] in [[New York City]]. After returning to Europe to serve in the German Army in World War I, Valentiner later was appointed to other positions in the US. From the mid-1920s, he strongly influenced the development of museum administration in the United States. \n\nHe served as director of the [[Detroit Institute of Art]] in [[Michigan]], from 1924 to 1945. Valentiner became a naturalized US citizen about 1930 and lived in the country for nearly half his life in total. During the early 1930s, he commissioned Mexican artist [[Diego Rivera]] to create a 27-panel mural series about Detroit industry for an interior court of the museum, and gained the patronage of [[Edsel Ford]] for the project.

It is also the first album by the band to not feature [[Christopher Karloff]], the band's lead guitarist and songwriter, following his departure during the writing stages of Kasabian's second album, ''[[Empire (Kasabian album)|Empire]]'' (2006). The rhythm guitarist [[Sergio Pizzorno]] took over as the main force behind the band's songwriting.\n\nThe album was nominated for the 2009 [[Mercury Prize]]. In October 2009, it was voted the best album of the year by [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' Magazine]].\n\n==History==\n\"Vlad the Impaler\" was made available as a free download from the official website from 31 March to 3 April 2009. The first proper, physical release from the album was \"[[Fire (Kasabian song)|Fire]]\", which was released on 1 June.<ref>[http://blog.kasabian.co.uk/post/89685282/vlad-the-impaler-free-download]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525030141/http://blog.kasabian.co.uk/post/89685282/vlad-the-impaler-free-download |date=25 May 2009 }}</ref> [[Sergio Pizzorno]] has called the 52-minute album \"the soundtrack to an imaginary movie.\" The album includes a duet, on the track \"West Ryder Silver Bullet\", with the actress [[Rosario Dawson]]. The album entered the [[UK Album Chart]] at No. 1, giving the band their second No. 1 album.\n\"Underdog\" has been used by [[Sony]] in a commercial for their [[BRAVIA]] Televisions.<ref name=\"Bravia-commercial\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvadmusic.co.uk/2009/02/sony-bravia-in-motion-with-kaka/|title=new BRAVIA ad from Sony featuring Danny Dyer, with music by Kasabian and their new track Underdog|date=28 February 2009|work=[[Bravia (brand)|Bravia]]|accessdate=15 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Theme==\nThe [[Stanley Royd Hospital|West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum]] was a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]] built in [[West Yorkshire]], England in 1818. [[Sergio Pizzorno]] further explained the choice of album title: \"The album isn't about the place, I just first heard about it on a TV documentary, and the words just struck me. I love the way it looked and the feeling it evokes. Apparently, it was one of the first loony bins for the poor, before that it was mainly rich people who got treatment.\"<ref name=\"NME-album-name\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/kasabian/45282|title=Kasabian reveal why they called album 'West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum'|date=12 June 2009|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|accessdate=13 June 2009}}</ref> The album cover depicts the band \"getting dressed up for a party at the [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]], looking in the mirror at the costumes\".

It is also the first album by the band to not feature [[Christopher Karloff]], the band's lead guitarist and songwriter, following his departure during the writing stages of Kasabian's second album, ''[[Empire (Kasabian album)|Empire]]'' (2006). The rhythm guitarist [[Sergio Pizzorno]] took over as the main force behind the band's songwriting.\n\nThe album was nominated for the 2009 [[Mercury Prize]]. In October 2009, it was voted the best album of the year by [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' Magazine]].\n\n==History==\n\"Vlad the Impaler\" was made available as a free download from the official website from 31 March to 3 April 2009.

The album entered the [[UK Album Chart]] at No. 1, giving the band their second No. 1 album.\n\"Underdog\" has been used by [[Sony]] in a commercial for their [[BRAVIA]] Televisions.<ref name=\"Bravia-commercial\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvadmusic.co.uk/2009/02/sony-bravia-in-motion-with-kaka/|title=new BRAVIA ad from Sony featuring Danny Dyer, with music by Kasabian and their new track Underdog|date=28 February 2009|work=[[Bravia (brand)|Bravia]]|accessdate=15 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Theme==\nThe [[Stanley Royd Hospital|West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum]] was a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]] built in [[West Yorkshire]], England in 1818. [[Sergio Pizzorno]] further explained the choice of album title: \"The album isn't about the place, I just first heard about it on a TV documentary, and the words just struck me. I love the way it looked and the feeling it evokes. Apparently, it was one of the first loony bins for the poor, before that it was mainly rich people who got treatment.\"<ref name=\"NME-album-name\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/kasabian/45282|title=Kasabian reveal why they called album 'West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum'|date=12 June 2009|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|accessdate=13 June 2009}}</ref> The album cover depicts the band \"getting dressed up for a party at the [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]], looking in the mirror at the costumes\".

Members of Kasabian's fan club at the time could buy the song on a one sided [[Gramophone record|10\"]]. Despite receiving some airplay and a limited release it never had a video. It was also used on the video game ''[[FIFA 09]]''.

This included the state of foreign affairs, and divisions between the newly formed [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] and [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] parties.<ref name=\"E&M1995\">{{cite book| first1=Stanley| last1=Elkins| first2=Eric| last2=McKitrick| title=The Age of Federalism: The Early American Republic, 1788-1800| publisher=Oxford University Press| date=1995| pages=489\u2013499| isbn=978-0-19-509381-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RyG29bER3QC&pg=PA489}}</ref>\n\nAs his second term came to a close four years later, Washington prepared a revision of the original letter with the help of Hamilton to write a new farewell address to announce his intention to decline a third term in office. He reflects on the emerging issues of the American political landscape in 1796, expresses his support for the government eight years after the adoption of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], defends his administration's record and gives valedictory advice to the American people.<ref name=\"Farewell Address\"/>\n\n== Summary ==\n[[File:Washington (3).jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[George Washington]] by [[Gilbert Stuart]]]]\nThe thought of the United States without George Washington as its president caused concern among many Americans. [[Thomas Jefferson]] disagreed with many of the president's policies and later led the Democratic-Republicans in opposition to many Federalist policies, but he joined his political rival [[Alexander Hamilton]]\u2014the leader of the Federalists\u2014in convincing the president to delay his retirement and serve a second term. The two men feared that the nation would be torn apart without his leadership. Washington most likely referred to this when he told the American people that he had wanted to retire before the last election, but he was convinced by people who were, in his words, \"entitled to my confidence\" that it was his duty to serve a second term.<ref name=\"E&M1995\"/> All of the ideas presented in Washington's Farewell Address came from Washington; however, Alexander Hamilton wrote most of it.<ref name=\"Primary Documents in American History\">{{cite web|title=George Washington's Farewell Address: Primary Documents of American History (Virtual Programs & Services, Library of Congress)|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/farewell.html|date=September 6, 2017|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=February 26, 2017|ref=9}}</ref>\n\nWashington sought to convince the American people that his service was no longer necessary by telling them, as he had in his first inaugural address, that he truly believed that he was never qualified to be president. If he accomplished anything during his presidency, he said, it was as a result of their support and efforts to help the country survive and prosper. Despite his confidence that the country would survive without his leadership, Washington used the majority of the letter to offer advice as a \"parting friend\" on what he believed were the greatest threats to the nation.<ref name=\"E&M1995\"/>\n\n=== Unity and sectionalism ===\nThe Address expresses Washington's understanding of republicanism by affirming popular government and warning about threats to \"Republican liberty\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert W. Watson|title=White House Studies Compendium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_0cTQo8t7oC&pg=PA319|year=2007|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=319}}</ref> He begins his warnings to the American people by stressing that their independence, peace at home and abroad, safety, prosperity, and liberty are all dependent upon unity among the states. He warns them that the union of states created by the Constitution will come under the most frequent and focused attacks by foreign and domestic enemies of the country. He warns the American people to be suspicious of anyone who seeks to abandon the Union, to secede a portion of the country from the rest, or to weaken the bonds that hold together the constitutional union. To promote the strength of the Union, he urges the people to place their identity as Americans above their identities as members of a state, city, or region, and to focus their efforts and affection on the country above all other local interests. He reminds the people that they do not have more than slight differences in religion, manners, habits, and political principles, and that their triumph and possession of independence and liberty are the result of working together.<ref name=\"E&M1995\"/>\n\nWashington continues to express his support of the Union by giving some examples of how he believes that the country, its regions, and its people are already benefiting from the unity which they currently share. He then looks to the future in his belief that the combined effort and resources of its people will protect the country from foreign attack and allow them to avoid wars between neighboring nations that often happen due to rivalries and competing relations with foreign nations. He argues that the security provided by the Union will also allow the United States to avoid the creation of an overgrown military which he sees as a great threat to liberty, especially the republican liberty which the United States has created.\n\nWashington goes on to warn the American people to question the ulterior motives of any person or group who argues that the land within the borders of the United States is too large to be ruled as a republic, an argument made by many during the debate on the proposed purchase of the [[Louisiana Territory]], calling on the people to give the experiment of a large republic a chance to work before deciding that it cannot be done. He then offers strong warnings on the dangers of [[sectionalism]], arguing that the true motives of a sectionalist are to create distrust or rivalries between regions and people to gain power and take control of the government. Washington points to the [[Jay Treaty]] and [[Pinckney's Treaty]] which established the borders of the United States' western territories between Spanish Mexico and British Canada, and secured the rights of western farmers to ship goods along the [[Mississippi River]] to New Orleans. He holds up these treaties as proof that the eastern states along the Atlantic Coast and the federal government are looking out for the welfare of all the American people and can win fair treatment from foreign countries as a united nation.<ref name=\"E&M1995\"/>\n\n=== Constitution and political factions ===\n[[File: Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Jefferson]], the founder of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]]]]\nWashington goes on to state his support for the new constitutional government, calling it an improvement upon the nation's original attempt in the [[Articles of Confederation]]. He reminds the people that it is the [[Right of revolution|right of the people to alter the government]] to meet their needs, but it should only be done through constitutional amendments. He reinforces this belief by arguing that violent takeovers of the government should be avoided at all costs and that it is the duty of every member of the republic to follow the constitution and to submit to the laws of the government until it is constitutionally amended by the majority of the American people.<ref name=\"WashingtonFarewell\">{{cite wikisource |first=George |last=Washington |authorlink=George Washington |date=September 17, 1796 |title=Washington's Farewell Address}}</ref>\n\nWashington warns the people that political factions may seek to obstruct the execution of the laws created by the government or to prevent the branches of government from enacting the powers provided them by the constitution. Such factions may claim to be trying to answer popular demands or solve pressing problems, but their true intentions are to take the power from the people and place it in the hands of unjust men.<ref name=\"WashingtonFarewell\"/>\n\nWashington calls the American people to only change the Constitution through amendments, but he then warns them that groups seeking to overthrow the government may strive to pass constitutional amendments to weaken the government to a point where it is unable to defend itself from political factions, enforce its laws, and protect the people's rights and property. As a result, he urges them to give the government time to realize its full potential, and only amend the constitution after thorough time and thought have proven that it is truly necessary instead of simply making changes based upon opinions and hypotheses of the moment.<ref name=\"WashingtonFarewell\"/>\n\n=== Political parties ===\n[[File: Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], the founder of the [[Federalist Party]]]]\nWashington continues to advance his idea of the dangers of sectionalism and expands his warning to include the dangers of political parties to the country as a whole. These warnings are given in the context of the recent rise of two opposing parties within the government\u2014the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] led by Jefferson, and Hamilton's [[Federalist Party]]. Washington had striven to remain neutral during a conflict between Britain and France brought about by the [[French Revolution]], while the Democratic-Republicans had made efforts to align with France, and the Federalists had made efforts to ally with Great Britain.\n\nWashington recognizes that it is natural for people to organize and operate within groups such as political parties, but he also argues that every government has recognized political parties as an enemy and has sought to repress them because of their tendency to seek more power than other groups and to take revenge on political opponents.<ref name=\"E&M1995\"/> He feels that disagreements between political parties weakened the government.\n\nMoreover, he makes the case that \"the alternate domination\" of one party over another and coinciding efforts to exact revenge upon their opponents have led to horrible atrocities, and \"is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism.\"  From Washington's perspective and judgment, political parties eventually and \"gradually incline the minds of men to seek security\u2026 in the absolute power of an individual\",<ref name=\"WashingtonFarewell\"/> leading to despotism. He acknowledges the fact that parties are sometimes beneficial in promoting liberty in monarchies, but he argues that political parties must be restrained in a popularly elected government because of their tendency to distract the government from their duties, create unfounded jealousies among groups and regions, raise false alarms among the people, promote riots and insurrection, and provide foreign nations and interests access to the government where they can impose their will upon the country.\n\n=== Checks and balances and separation of powers ===\nWashington continues his defense of the Constitution by stating that the system of [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] and [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] within it are important means of preventing a single person or group from seizing control of the country. He advises the American people that, if they believe that it is necessary to modify the powers granted to the government through the Constitution, it should be done through constitutional amendments instead of through force.\n\n[[File:Valley Forge prayer.jpg|thumb|This 1866 engraving depicts Washington praying at [[Valley Forge]]]]\n\n=== Religion, morality and education ===\nOne of the most referenced parts of Washington's letter is his strong support of the importance of religion and morality in promoting private and public happiness and in promoting the political prosperity of the nation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} He argues that religious principles promote the protection of property, reputation, and life that are the foundations of justice. He cautions against the belief that the nation's morality can be maintained without religion:\n{{quote|Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion, and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked: Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.<ref name=\"WashingtonFarewell\"/>}}\n\nWashington refers to religious principle as the foundation of public morality.  He also argues that the American government needs to ensure \"the general diffusion of knowledge\"<ref name=\"Farewell Address\" /> throughout the United States; the government has been created to enforce the opinion of the people, so the opinion of the people should be informed and knowledgeable.\n\n=== Credit and government attacking ===\nWashington provides strong support for a balanced federal budget, arguing that the nation's credit is an important source of strength and security. He urges the American people to preserve the national credit by avoiding war, avoiding unnecessary borrowing, and paying off any national debt accumulated in times of war as quickly as possible in times of peace so that future generations do not have to take on the financial burdens. Despite his warnings to avoid taking on debt, Washington does state his belief that sometimes it is necessary to spend money to prevent dangers or wars that will cost more if not properly prepared for. At these times, he argues, it is necessary for the people to cooperate by paying taxes to cover these precautionary expenses. He emphasizes how important it is for the government to be careful in choosing the items that will be taxed, but also reminds the American people that, no matter how hard the government tries, there will never be a tax which is not inconvenient and unpleasant to those who must pay it.\n\n=== Foreign relations and free trade ===\nWashington dedicates a large part of his farewell address to discussing foreign relations and the dangers of permanent alliances between the United States and foreign nations, which he views as foreign entanglements.<ref>{{cite journal| first=Samuel Flagg| last=Bemis| title=Washington's Farewell Address: A Foreign Policy of Independence| journal=American Historical Review| date=1934| volume=39| issue=2| pages=250\u2013268| jstor=1838722}}</ref> He advocates a policy of good faith and justice towards all nations, again making reference to proper behavior based upon religious doctrine and morality. He urges the American people to avoid long-term friendly relations or rivalries with any nation, arguing that attachments with or animosity toward other nations will only cloud the government's judgment in its foreign policy. He argues that longstanding poor relations will only lead to unnecessary wars due to a tendency to blow minor offenses out of proportion when committed by nations viewed as enemies of the United States. He continues this argument by claiming that alliances are likely to draw the United States into wars that have no justification and no benefit to the country beyond simply defending the favored nation. Alliances, he warns, often lead to poor relations with nations who feel that they are not being treated as well as America's allies, and threaten to influence the American government into making decisions based upon the will of their allies instead of the will of the American people.\n[[Image:Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat|Citizen Gen\u00eat]] was the French minister who interfered in U.S. politics]]\n\nWashington makes an extended reference to the dangers of foreign nations who will seek to influence the American people and government; nations who may be considered friendly as well as nations considered enemies will equally try to influence the government to do their will. \"Real patriots\", he warns, who \"resist the intrigues\" of foreign nations may find themselves \"suspected and odious\" in the eyes of others, yet he urges the people to stand firm against such influences all the same. He portrays those who attempt to further such foreign interests as becoming the \"tools and dupes\" of those nations, stealing the applause and praise of their country away from the \"real patriots\" while actually working to \"surrender\" American interests to foreign nations.\n\nWashington goes on to urge the American people to take advantage of their isolated position in the world, and to avoid attachments and entanglements in foreign affairs, especially those of Europe, which he argues have little or nothing to do with the interests of America. He argues that it makes no sense for the American people to become embroiled in European affairs when their isolated position and unity allow them to remain neutral and focus on their own affairs. He argues that the country should avoid permanent alliances with all foreign nations, although temporary alliances during times of extreme danger may be necessary. He states that current treaties should be honored but not extended.\n\nWashington wraps up his foreign policy stance by advocating free trade with all nations, arguing that trade links should be established naturally and the role of the government should be limited to ensuring stable trade, defending the rights of American merchants and any provisions necessary to ensure the conventional rules of trade.\n\n=== Address's intentions ===\nWashington uses this portion of the address to explain that he does not expect his advice to make any great impression upon the people or to change the course of American politics, but he does hope that the people will remember his devoted service to his country.\n\n=== Defense of the Proclamation of Neutrality ===\nWashington then explains his reasoning behind the [[Proclamation of Neutrality]] which he made during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], despite the standing [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] with France. He explains that the United States had a right to remain neutral in the conflict and that the correctness of that decision \"has been virtually admitted by all\" nations since. Justice and humanity required him to remain neutral during the conflict, he argues, and the neutrality was also necessary to allow the new government a chance to mature and gain enough strength to control its own affairs.\n\n=== Closing thoughts ===\nWashington closes his letter to the American people by asking them to forgive any failures which may have occurred during his service to the country, assuring them that they were due to his own weaknesses and by no means intentional. The sentences express his excitement about joining his fellow Americans as a private citizen in the free government which they have created together during his 45 years of public service.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{see|Post-presidency of George Washington}}\nWashington's Farewell Address is considered to be one of the most important documents in American history<ref name=\"loc.gov\"/> and the foundation of the Federalist Party's political doctrine.\n\nWashington later accepted a commission from President [[John Adams]], despite his stated desire to retire from public service, as the [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer]] of a Provisional Army formed to defend the nation against a possible invasion by French forces during the [[Quasi-War]].<ref name=\"mountvernon.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/learn/meet_george/index.cfm/ss/21/ |title=A Brief Biography of George Washington |publisher=Mountvernon.org |accessdate=September 19, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823160852/http://www.mountvernon.org/learn/meet_george/index.cfm/ss/21 |archivedate=August 23, 2011 }}</ref> Washington held true to his statements in his farewell address, despite spending months organizing the Officer Corps of the Provisional Army, and declined suggestions that he return to public office in the [[1800 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1800]].<ref name=\"mountvernon.org\"/>\n\nWashington's statements on the importance of religion and morality in American politics and his warnings on the dangers of foreign alliances influenced political debates into the twentieth century,<ref name=\"loc.gov\"/> and have received special consideration as advice from an American hero.\n\n=== Alliances with foreign nations ===\nWashington's hope that the United States would end permanent alliances with foreign nations was realized in 1800 with the [[Convention of 1800]], the Treaty of Mortefontaine which officially ended the 1778 Treaty of Alliance, in exchange for ending the Quasi-War and establishing [[Most favoured nation|most favored nation]] trade relations with [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xenophongroup.com/mcjoynt/alliance2.htm |title=Perspective On The French-American Alliance |publisher=Xenophongroup.com |date= |accessdate=September 19, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120014620/http://xenophongroup.com/mcjoynt/alliance2.htm |archive-date=January 20, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1823, Washington's foreign policy goals were further realized in the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which promised non-interference in European affairs so long as the nations of Europe did not seek to colonize or interfere with the newly independent Latin American nations of Central and [[South America]].

He reflects on the emerging issues of the American political landscape in 1796, expresses his support for the government eight years after the adoption of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], defends his administration's record and gives valedictory advice to the American people.<ref name=\"Farewell Address\"/>\n\n== Summary ==\n[[File:Washington (3).jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[George Washington]] by [[Gilbert Stuart]]]]\nThe thought of the United States without George Washington as its president caused concern among many Americans. [[Thomas Jefferson]] disagreed with many of the president's policies and later led the Democratic-Republicans in opposition to many Federalist policies, but he joined his political rival [[Alexander Hamilton]]\u2014the leader of the Federalists\u2014in convincing the president to delay his retirement and serve a second term. The two men feared that the nation would be torn apart without his leadership. Washington most likely referred to this when he told the American people that he had wanted to retire before the last election, but he was convinced by people who were, in his words, \"entitled to my confidence\" that it was his duty to serve a second term.<ref name=\"E&M1995\"/> All of the ideas presented in Washington's Farewell Address came from Washington; however, Alexander Hamilton wrote most of it.<ref name=\"Primary Documents in American History\">{{cite web|title=George Washington's Farewell Address: Primary Documents of American History (Virtual Programs & Services, Library of Congress)|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/farewell.html|date=September 6, 2017|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=February 26, 2017|ref=9}}</ref>\n\nWashington sought to convince the American people that his service was no longer necessary by telling them, as he had in his first inaugural address, that he truly believed that he was never qualified to be president. If he accomplished anything during his presidency, he said, it was as a result of their support and efforts to help the country survive and prosper. Despite his confidence that the country would survive without his leadership, Washington used the majority of the letter to offer advice as a \"parting friend\" on what he believed were the greatest threats to the nation.<ref name=\"E&M1995\"/>\n\n=== Unity and sectionalism ===\nThe Address expresses Washington's understanding of republicanism by affirming popular government and warning about threats to \"Republican liberty\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert W. Watson|title=White House Studies Compendium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_0cTQo8t7oC&pg=PA319|year=2007|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=319}}</ref> He begins his warnings to the American people by stressing that their independence, peace at home and abroad, safety, prosperity, and liberty are all dependent upon unity among the states. He warns them that the union of states created by the Constitution will come under the most frequent and focused attacks by foreign and domestic enemies of the country. He warns the American people to be suspicious of anyone who seeks to abandon the Union, to secede a portion of the country from the rest, or to weaken the bonds that hold together the constitutional union. To promote the strength of the Union, he urges the people to place their identity as Americans above their identities as members of a state, city, or region, and to focus their efforts and affection on the country above all other local interests. He reminds the people that they do not have more than slight differences in religion, manners, habits, and political principles, and that their triumph and possession of independence and liberty are the result of working together.<ref name=\"E&M1995\"/>\n\nWashington continues to express his support of the Union by giving some examples of how he believes that the country, its regions, and its people are already benefiting from the unity which they currently share. He then looks to the future in his belief that the combined effort and resources of its people will protect the country from foreign attack and allow them to avoid wars between neighboring nations that often happen due to rivalries and competing relations with foreign nations. He argues that the security provided by the Union will also allow the United States to avoid the creation of an overgrown military which he sees as a great threat to liberty, especially the republican liberty which the United States has created.\n\nWashington goes on to warn the American people to question the ulterior motives of any person or group who argues that the land within the borders of the United States is too large to be ruled as a republic, an argument made by many during the debate on the proposed purchase of the [[Louisiana Territory]], calling on the people to give the experiment of a large republic a chance to work before deciding that it cannot be done. He then offers strong warnings on the dangers of [[sectionalism]], arguing that the true motives of a sectionalist are to create distrust or rivalries between regions and people to gain power and take control of the government. Washington points to the [[Jay Treaty]] and [[Pinckney's Treaty]] which established the borders of the United States' western territories between Spanish Mexico and British Canada, and secured the rights of western farmers to ship goods along the [[Mississippi River]] to New Orleans. He holds up these treaties as proof that the eastern states along the Atlantic Coast and the federal government are looking out for the welfare of all the American people and can win fair treatment from foreign countries as a united nation.<ref name=\"E&M1995\"/>\n\n=== Constitution and political factions ===\n[[File: Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Jefferson]], the founder of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]]]]\nWashington goes on to state his support for the new constitutional government, calling it an improvement upon the nation's original attempt in the [[Articles of Confederation]]. He reminds the people that it is the [[Right of revolution|right of the people to alter the government]] to meet their needs, but it should only be done through constitutional amendments. He reinforces this belief by arguing that violent takeovers of the government should be avoided at all costs and that it is the duty of every member of the republic to follow the constitution and to submit to the laws of the government until it is constitutionally amended by the majority of the American people.<ref name=\"WashingtonFarewell\">{{cite wikisource |first=George |last=Washington |authorlink=George Washington |date=September 17, 1796 |title=Washington's Farewell Address}}</ref>\n\nWashington warns the people that political factions may seek to obstruct the execution of the laws created by the government or to prevent the branches of government from enacting the powers provided them by the constitution. Such factions may claim to be trying to answer popular demands or solve pressing problems, but their true intentions are to take the power from the people and place it in the hands of unjust men.<ref name=\"WashingtonFarewell\"/>\n\nWashington calls the American people to only change the Constitution through amendments, but he then warns them that groups seeking to overthrow the government may strive to pass constitutional amendments to weaken the government to a point where it is unable to defend itself from political factions, enforce its laws, and protect the people's rights and property. As a result, he urges them to give the government time to realize its full potential, and only amend the constitution after thorough time and thought have proven that it is truly necessary instead of simply making changes based upon opinions and hypotheses of the moment.<ref name=\"WashingtonFarewell\"/>\n\n=== Political parties ===\n[[File: Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], the founder of the [[Federalist Party]]]]\nWashington continues to advance his idea of the dangers of sectionalism and expands his warning to include the dangers of political parties to the country as a whole. These warnings are given in the context of the recent rise of two opposing parties within the government\u2014the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] led by Jefferson, and Hamilton's [[Federalist Party]]. Washington had striven to remain neutral during a conflict between Britain and France brought about by the [[French Revolution]], while the Democratic-Republicans had made efforts to align with France, and the Federalists had made efforts to ally with Great Britain.\n\nWashington recognizes that it is natural for people to organize and operate within groups such as political parties, but he also argues that every government has recognized political parties as an enemy and has sought to repress them because of their tendency to seek more power than other groups and to take revenge on political opponents.<ref name=\"E&M1995\"/> He feels that disagreements between political parties weakened the government.\n\nMoreover, he makes the case that \"the alternate domination\" of one party over another and coinciding efforts to exact revenge upon their opponents have led to horrible atrocities, and \"is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism.\"  From Washington's perspective and judgment, political parties eventually and \"gradually incline the minds of men to seek security\u2026 in the absolute power of an individual\",<ref name=\"WashingtonFarewell\"/> leading to despotism. He acknowledges the fact that parties are sometimes beneficial in promoting liberty in monarchies, but he argues that political parties must be restrained in a popularly elected government because of their tendency to distract the government from their duties, create unfounded jealousies among groups and regions, raise false alarms among the people, promote riots and insurrection, and provide foreign nations and interests access to the government where they can impose their will upon the country.\n\n=== Checks and balances and separation of powers ===\nWashington continues his defense of the Constitution by stating that the system of [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] and [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] within it are important means of preventing a single person or group from seizing control of the country. He advises the American people that, if they believe that it is necessary to modify the powers granted to the government through the Constitution, it should be done through constitutional amendments instead of through force.\n\n[[File:Valley Forge prayer.jpg|thumb|This 1866 engraving depicts Washington praying at [[Valley Forge]]]]\n\n=== Religion, morality and education ===\nOne of the most referenced parts of Washington's letter is his strong support of the importance of religion and morality in promoting private and public happiness and in promoting the political prosperity of the nation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} He argues that religious principles promote the protection of property, reputation, and life that are the foundations of justice. He cautions against the belief that the nation's morality can be maintained without religion:\n{{quote|Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion, and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked: Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.<ref name=\"WashingtonFarewell\"/>}}\n\nWashington refers to religious principle as the foundation of public morality.  He also argues that the American government needs to ensure \"the general diffusion of knowledge\"<ref name=\"Farewell Address\" /> throughout the United States; the government has been created to enforce the opinion of the people, so the opinion of the people should be informed and knowledgeable.\n\n=== Credit and government borrowing ===\nWashington provides strong support for a balanced federal budget, arguing that the nation's credit is an important source of strength and security. He urges the American people to preserve the national credit by avoiding war, avoiding unnecessary borrowing, and paying off any national debt accumulated in times of war as quickly as possible in times of peace so that future generations do not have to take on the financial burdens. Despite his warnings to avoid taking on debt, Washington does state his belief that sometimes it is necessary to spend money to prevent dangers or wars that will cost more if not properly prepared for. At these times, he argues, it is necessary for the people to cooperate by paying taxes to cover these precautionary expenses. He emphasizes how important it is for the government to be careful in choosing the items that will be taxed, but also reminds the American people that, no matter how hard the government tries, there will never be a tax which is not inconvenient and unpleasant to those who must pay it.\n\n=== Foreign relations and free trade ===\nWashington dedicates a large part of his farewell address to discussing foreign relations and the dangers of permanent alliances between the United States and foreign nations, which he views as foreign entanglements.<ref>{{cite journal| first=Samuel Flagg| last=Bemis| title=Washington's Farewell Address: A Foreign Policy of Independence| journal=American Historical Review| date=1934| volume=39| issue=2| pages=250\u2013268| jstor=1838722}}</ref> He advocates a policy of good faith and justice towards all nations, again making reference to proper behavior based upon religious doctrine and morality. He urges the American people to avoid long-term friendly relations or rivalries with any nation, arguing that attachments with or animosity toward other nations will only cloud the government's judgment in its foreign policy. He argues that longstanding poor relations will only lead to unnecessary wars due to a tendency to blow minor offenses out of proportion when committed by nations viewed as enemies of the United States. He continues this argument by claiming that alliances are likely to draw the United States into wars that have no justification and no benefit to the country beyond simply defending the favored nation. Alliances, he warns, often lead to poor relations with nations who feel that they are not being treated as well as America's allies, and threaten to influence the American government into making decisions based upon the will of their allies instead of the will of the American people.\n[[Image:Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat|Citizen Gen\u00eat]] was the French minister who interfered in U.S. politics]]\n\nWashington makes an extended reference to the dangers of foreign nations who will seek to influence the American people and government; nations who may be considered friendly as well as nations considered enemies will equally try to influence the government to do their will. \"Real patriots\", he warns, who \"resist the intrigues\" of foreign nations may find themselves \"suspected and odious\" in the eyes of others, yet he urges the people to stand firm against such influences all the same. He portrays those who attempt to further such foreign interests as becoming the \"tools and dupes\" of those nations, stealing the applause and praise of their country away from the \"real patriots\" while actually working to \"surrender\" American interests to foreign nations.\n\nWashington goes on to urge the American people to take advantage of their isolated position in the world, and to avoid attachments and entanglements in foreign affairs, especially those of Europe, which he argues have little or nothing to do with the interests of America. He argues that it makes no sense for the American people to become embroiled in European affairs when their isolated position and unity allow them to remain neutral and focus on their own affairs. He argues that the country should avoid permanent alliances with all foreign nations, although temporary alliances during times of extreme danger may be necessary. He states that current treaties should be honored but not extended.\n\nWashington wraps up his foreign policy stance by advocating free trade with all nations, arguing that trade links should be established naturally and the role of the government should be limited to ensuring stable trade, defending the rights of American merchants and any provisions necessary to ensure the conventional rules of trade.\n\n=== Address's intentions ===\nWashington uses this portion of the address to explain that he does not expect his advice to make any great impression upon the people or to change the course of American politics, but he does hope that the people will remember his devoted service to his country.\n\n=== Defense of the Proclamation of Neutrality ===\nWashington then explains his reasoning behind the [[Proclamation of Neutrality]] which he made during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], despite the standing [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] with France. He explains that the United States had a right to remain neutral in the conflict and that the correctness of that decision \"has been virtually admitted by all\" nations since. Justice and humanity required him to remain neutral during the conflict, he argues, and the neutrality was also necessary to allow the new government a chance to mature and gain enough strength to control its own affairs.\n\n=== Closing thoughts ===\nWashington closes his letter to the American people by asking them to forgive any failures which may have occurred during his service to the country, assuring them that they were due to his own weaknesses and by no means intentional. The sentences express his excitement about joining his fellow Americans as a private citizen in the free government which they have created together during his 45 years of public service.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{see|Post-presidency of George Washington}}\nWashington's Farewell Address is considered to be one of the most important documents in American history<ref name=\"loc.gov\"/> and the foundation of the Federalist Party's political doctrine.\n\nWashington later accepted a commission from President [[John Adams]], despite his stated desire to retire from public service, as the [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer]] of a Provisional Army formed to defend the nation against a possible invasion by French forces during the [[Quasi-War]].<ref name=\"mountvernon.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/learn/meet_george/index.cfm/ss/21/ |title=A Brief Biography of George Washington |publisher=Mountvernon.org |accessdate=September 19, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823160852/http://www.mountvernon.org/learn/meet_george/index.cfm/ss/21 |archivedate=August 23, 2011 }}</ref> Washington held true to his statements in his farewell address, despite spending months organizing the Officer Corps of the Provisional Army, and declined suggestions that he return to public office in the [[1800 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1800]].<ref name=\"mountvernon.org\"/>\n\nWashington's statements on the importance of religion and morality in American politics and his warnings on the dangers of foreign alliances influenced political debates into the twentieth century,<ref name=\"loc.gov\"/> and have received special consideration as advice from an American hero.\n\n=== Alliances with foreign nations ===\nWashington's hope that the United States would end permanent alliances with foreign nations was realized in 1800 with the [[Convention of 1800]], the Treaty of Mortefontaine which officially ended the 1778 Treaty of Alliance, in exchange for ending the Quasi-War and establishing [[Most favoured nation|most favored nation]] trade relations with [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xenophongroup.com/mcjoynt/alliance2.htm |title=Perspective On The French-American Alliance |publisher=Xenophongroup.com |date= |accessdate=September 19, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120014620/http://xenophongroup.com/mcjoynt/alliance2.htm |archive-date=January 20, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1823, Washington's foreign policy goals were further realized in the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which promised non-interference in European affairs so long as the nations of Europe did not seek to colonize or interfere with the newly independent Latin American nations of Central and [[South America]].
