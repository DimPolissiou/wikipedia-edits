In addition to [[paper currency]], the BEP produces [[United States Treasury security|Treasury securities]]; [[Commissioned officer|military commissions]] and award certificates; invitations and admission cards; and many different types of [[identification card]]s, forms, and other special security documents for a variety of government agencies. The BEP does not produce [[United States coinage|coins]]; all coinage is produced by the [[United States Mint]]. With production facilities in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Fort Worth, Texas]], the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is the largest producer of government security documents in the [[United States of America|United States]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bureau of Engraving and Printing, aerial view - Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|left|180px|upright|Aerial view of the BEP in [[Washington, D.C.]] circa 1918]]\n[[File:United States Souvenir Card HAPEX 1970.jpg|thumb|right|180px|upright|United States Souvenir Card issued by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, for the HAPEX APS 70 exhibition and 84th Annual Convention of the American Philatelic Society in 1970]]\n\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing has its origins in legislation enacted to help fund the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  In July 1861, [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] to issue [[paper currency]] in lieu of [[coin]]s due to the lack of funds needed to support the conflict.  The paper [[banknote|notes]] were essentially government [[promissory note|IOUs]] and were called [[Demand Note]]s because they were payable \"on demand\" in coin at certain Treasury facilities. At this time the government had no facility for the production of paper money so a private firm produced the Demand Notes in sheets of four. These sheets were then sent to the Treasury Department where dozens of clerks signed the notes and scores of workers cut the sheets and trimmed the notes by hand. The [[Legal tender#United States|Second Legal Tender Act]] (July 11, 1862; {{USStat|12|532}}) authorized the Treasury Secretary to engrave and print notes at the Treasury Department; the design of which incorporates fine-line engraving, intricate geometric lathe work patterns, a Treasury seal, and engraved signatures to aid in counterfeit deterrence.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Currency|url=https://www.moneyfactory.gov/uscurrency/history.html|publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing U.S. Department of the Treasury|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the currency processing operations in the Treasury were not formally organized. When Congress created the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of Comptroller of the Currency]] and National Currency Bureau in 1863, currency-processing operations were nominally subordinated to that agency and designated the \"First Division, National Currency Bureau\".  For years, however, the currency operations were known by various semi-official labels, such as the \"Printing Bureau\", \"Small Note Bureau\", \"Currency Department\", and \"Small Note Room\".  It was not until 1874 that the \"Bureau of Engraving and Printing\" was officially recognized in congressional [[legislation]] with a specific allocation of operating funds for fiscal year 1875.\n\nFrom almost the very beginning of its operations, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing designed and printed a variety of products in addition to currency. As early as 1864, the offices which would later become the BEP made [[United States passport|passport]]s for the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and [[money order]]s for the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office Department]]. Passports are now produced by the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Publishing Office]]. Other early items produced by the BEP included various government debt instruments, such as interest-bearing notes, refunding certificates, compound interest Treasury notes, and [[bond (finance)|bonds]]. The production of [[postage stamp]]s began in 1894, and for almost the next century the BEP was the sole producer of postage stamps in the country.\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\">\nFile:United States Bureau of Printing and Engraving - 2012-03-15.jpg|15th Street SW entrance to the BEP in Washington, D.C.  \nFile:Bureau of Engraving and Printing, entrance - Washington, D.C..jpg|13th Street SW entrance to the BEP Annex in Washington, D.C.\nFile:Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Fort Worth, TX IMG 7075.JPG|The Bureau's [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] location, with visitor tours available during business hours.\n</gallery>\n\n== Production ==\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing officially took over production of postage stamps for the United States government in July 1894.

The first of the works printed by the BEP was placed on sale on July 18, 1894, and by the end of the first year of stamp production, the BEP had printed and delivered more than 2.1&nbsp;billion stamps. The [[United States Postal Service]] switched purely to private postage stamp printers in 2005, ending 111 years of production by the Bureau.<ref>{{cite news|last=McAllister|first=Bill|title=After 111 Years, Postage Stamps Go Private|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/12/AR2005061201253.html|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=13 June 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"2005CompState-ch2p14\">{{cite web|title=2005 Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations|url=http://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/cs05/chp2-014.html|publisher=USPS|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Starting in 2011 the United States Postal Service in-housed all postage stamp printing services.\n\n=== Currency production ===\n[[Image:Onedolar2009series.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Federal Reserve [[United States one-dollar bill|$1 note]], 2009 issue]]\nPlate capacity on power presses increased from four to eight notes per sheet in 1918 in order to meet greatly expanded production requirements related to [[World War I]].\n\nWith the redesign of [[United States note|currency]] in 1929, the first major change since paper currency was first issued in 1861, note design was not only standardized but note size was also significantly reduced. Due to this reduction in size, the Bureau was able to convert from eight-note printing plates to twelve-note plates. The redesign effort came about for several reasons, chief among them a reduction in paper costs and improved [[counterfeit]] deterrence through better public recognition of currency features.\n\nA further increase in the number of notes per sheet was realized in 1952 after breakthrough developments in the production of non-offset inks. Beginning in 1943, the BEP experimented with new [[ink]]s that dried faster, therefore obviating the need to place tissues between sheets to prevent ink from offsetting to other sheets. The faster drying ink also enabled printed sheets of backs to be kept damp until the faces were printed, thereby reducing distortion caused by wetting, drying, and re-wetting of the paper (sheets needed to be dampened before each printing).\n\n[[Image:Three Consecutively Numbered Two-dollar Notes.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Three consecutive [[United States two-dollar bill|$2 notes]], 2009 issue]]\nBy reducing the distortion that increases proportionally with the size of the sheet of paper, the Bureau was able to convert from 12-note printing plates to plates capable of printing 18 notes in 1952. Five years later in 1957, the Bureau began printing currency via the dry [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method that utilizes special paper and non-offset inks, enabling a further increase from 18 to 32 notes per sheet. Since 1968, all currency has been printed by means of the dry intaglio process, whereby wetting of the paper prior to printing is unnecessary. In this process, fine-line engravings are transferred to steel plates from which an impression is made on sheets of distinctive paper. Ink is applied to a plate containing 32 note impressions, which is then wiped clean, leaving ink in the engraved lines. The plate is pressed against the sheet of paper with such pressure as to actually press the paper into the lines of the plate to pick up the ink. Both faces and backs are printed in this manner&nbsp;\u2013 backs first. After the faces are printed, the sheets are then typographically overprinted with [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Seals]] and [[serial number]]s.\n\nDuring [[Fiscal Year]] 2013, the Bureau delivered 6.6&nbsp;billion notes at an average cost of 10 cents per note.<ref name=\"Bureau_cost\">Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

In addition to [[paper currency]], the BEP produces [[United States Treasury security|Treasury securities]]; [[Commissioned officer|military commissions]] and award certificates; invitations and admission cards; and many different types of [[identification card]]s, forms, and other special security documents for a variety of government agencies. The BEP does not produce [[United States coinage|coins]]; all coinage is produced by the [[United States Mint]]. With production facilities in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Fort Worth, Texas]], the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is the largest producer of government security documents in the [[United States of America|United States]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bureau of Engraving and Printing, aerial view - Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|left|180px|upright|Aerial view of the BEP in [[Washington, D.C.]] circa 1918]]\n[[File:United States Souvenir Card HAPEX 1970.jpg|thumb|right|180px|upright|United States Souvenir Card issued by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, for the HAPEX APS 70 exhibition and 84th Annual Convention of the American Philatelic Society in 1970]]\n\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing has its origins in legislation enacted to help fund the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  In July 1861, [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] to issue [[paper currency]] in lieu of [[coin]]s due to the lack of funds needed to support the conflict.  The paper [[banknote|notes]] were essentially government [[promissory note|IOUs]] and were called [[Demand Note]]s because they were payable \"on demand\" in coin at certain Treasury facilities. At this time the government had no facility for the production of paper money so a private firm produced the Demand Notes in sheets of four. These sheets were then sent to the Treasury Department where dozens of clerks signed the notes and scores of workers cut the sheets and trimmed the notes by hand. The [[Legal tender#United States|Second Legal Tender Act]] (July 11, 1862; {{USStat|12|532}}) authorized the Treasury Secretary to engrave and print notes at the Treasury Department; the design of which incorporates fine-line engraving, intricate geometric lathe work patterns, a Treasury seal, and engraved signatures to aid in counterfeit deterrence.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Currency|url=https://www.moneyfactory.gov/uscurrency/history.html|publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing U.S. Department of the Treasury|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}</ref> \n\nInitially, the currency processing operations in the Treasury were not formally organized. When Congress created the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of Comptroller of the Currency]] and National Currency Bureau in 1863, currency-processing operations were nominally subordinated to that agency and designated the \"First Division, National Currency Bureau\".  For years, however, the currency operations were known by various semi-official labels, such as the \"Printing Bureau\", \"Small Note Bureau\", \"Currency Department\", and \"Small Note Room\".  It was not until 1874 that the \"Bureau of Engraving and Printing\" was officially recognized in congressional [[legislation]] with a specific allocation of operating funds for fiscal year 1875.\n\nFrom almost the very beginning of its operations, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing designed and printed a variety of products in addition to currency.

Available from: http://www.pnas.org/content/95/5/2044.full</ref> However, results from research conducted on [[Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense|''Fusarium oxysporum'' f. sp. ''cubense'']] forced scientists to question these assumptions. Researchers used anonymous, single-copy [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|restriction fragment length polymorphsims]] (RFLPs) to identify 10 clonal lineages from a collection of [[Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense|''F. oxysporum'' f.sp. ''cubense'']] from across the world. These results showed that pathogens of [[banana]] causing [[Panama disease]] could be as closely related to other host's pathogens, such as melon or tomato, as they are to each other. Exceptional amounts of genetic diversity within ''F. oxysporum'' f.sp. ''cubense'' were deduced from the high level of chromosomal polymorphisms found among strains, random amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprints and from the number and geographic distribution of vegetative compatibility groups.<ref>Fourie G, Steenkamp ET, Gordon TR, and Viljoen A. 2009. Relationships among the Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense vegetative compatibility groups. Applied and Environmental Microbiology (internet) (cited 2014 October 30). 75(14): 4770-4781. Available from: http://aem.asm.org/content/75/14/4770.full.pdf+html</ref>\n\n==Pathogen==\nPresented with the wide-ranging occurrence of ''F. oxysporum'' strains that are nonpathogenic, it is reasonable to conclude that certain pathogenic forms were descended from originally nonpathogenic ancestors. Given the association of these fungi with plant roots, a form that is able to grow beyond the cortex and into the xylem could exploit this ability and hopefully gain an advantage over fungi that are restricted to the cortex.\n\nThe progression of a fungus into vascular tissue may elicit an immediate host response, successfully restricting the invader; or an otherwise ineffective or delayed response, reducing the vital water-conducting capacity and induce wilting.<ref>Ploetz R. 2006. Fusarium Wilt of Banana is Caused by Several Pathogens Referred to as Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense. Phytopathology (internet) (cited 2014 October 30). 96(6): 653-656. Available from: http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PHYTO-96-0653</ref> On the other hand, the plant might be able to tolerate limited growth of the fungus within xylem vessels, preceded by an endophytic association.<ref>Appel DJ, and Gordon TR. 1994. Local and regional variation in populations of Fusarium oxysporum from agricultural field soils. Phytopathology (internet) (Cited 2014 October 30) 84:786-791. Available from: http://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1994Articles/Phyto84n08_786.PDF</ref> In this case, any further changes in the host or parasite could disturb the relationship, in a way that fungal activities or a host response would result in the generation of disease symptoms.\n\n[[Pathogenic]] strains of ''F. oxysporum'' have been studied for more than 100 years. The [[host range]] of these fungi is broad and includes animals, ranging from [[arthropod]]s<ref>Teetor-Barsch, G.H. and Roberts, D.W. 1983. Entomogenous Fusarium species. Mycopathologia 84:3-16.</ref> to humans,<ref>Nelson, P.E., Dignani, M.C. and Anaissie, E.J. 1994. Taxonomy, biology, and clinical aspects of ''Fusarium'' species. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 7:479-504.</ref> as well as plants, including a range of both [[gymnosperm]]s and [[angiosperm]]s. While collectively, plant pathogenic ''F. oxysporum'' strains have a broad host range, individual isolates usually cause disease only in a narrow range of plant species. This observation has led to the idea of \"special form\" or ''[[forma specialis]]'' in ''F. oxysporum''. ''Formae speciales'' have been defined as \"...an informal rank in Classification... used for parasitic fungi characterized from a physiological standpoint (e.g. by the ability to cause disease in particular hosts) but scarcely or not at all from a [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] standpoint.\" Exhaustive host range studies have been conducted for relatively few ''formae speciales'' of ''F. oxysporum''.<ref>Kistler, H.C. 2001.
