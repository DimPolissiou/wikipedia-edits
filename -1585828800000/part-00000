As part of the ''[[Conker (series)|Conker]]'' series, the game follows the story of [[Conker the Squirrel]], a greedy, heavy-drinking [[red squirrel]] who must return home to his girlfriend. Most of the game requires the player to complete a linear sequence of challenges that involve jumping over obstacles, solving [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]], and fighting enemies. A [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode where up to four players can compete against each other in seven different game types is also included. Designed for mature audiences, ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' features [[graphic violence]], [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] use, [[profanity]], [[Off-color humor|vulgar humor]], and [[popular culture|pop culture]] references.\n\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was developed over the course of four years. Although it was originally designed for a family audience, the game was retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]''. Upon release, ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was acclaimed by video game critics, who praised its visual appeal and smart humour. The game sold well below expectations due to limited advertising and a release towards the end of the Nintendo 64's life cycle, but has since earned a [[cult following]]. A [[Video game remake|remake]], ''[[Conker: Live & Reloaded]]'', was released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in 2005. In 2015, the game was included as part of the ''[[Rare Replay]]'' compilation for [[Xbox One]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:CBFD-graphics.jpg|left|thumb|The player can travel from one [[Level (video gaming)|level]] to another through the game's [[overworld]]. Each area has a distinct colour theme.]]\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is a [[Platform game|platformer]] [[video game]] where the player controls [[Conker the Squirrel]] through a series of three-dimensional [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].<ref name=\"IGN review\" /> The game features an [[overworld]] where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/> Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], solving [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]], gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/>\n\nAs compared to the player characters in [[Rare (company)|Rare]]'s previous platform games ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', Conker's abilities are simpler.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/> The player can run, jump, and smack enemies with a [[frying pan]]. Conker can also swim underwater for a limited period of time, climb ladders or ropes, and push objects.<ref name=\"manual\"/> To regain lost health, Conker can eat pieces of \"anti-gravity\" Chocolate that are scattered throughout the levels.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/> The game employs \"[[Context-sensitive user interface|context sensitive]]\" pads that allow Conker to gain different, temporary abilities when pressing the \"[[Nintendo 64 controller|B]]\" button atop them.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/> For instance, in the beginning of the game, by pressing the B button on the first pad he encounters, Conker drinks some [[Alka-Seltzer]] to wipe out his hangover, at which point players can proceed forward. Some pads can turn Conker into an anvil to slam into the ground, while others pull out his shotgun, throwing knives, and [[slingshot]]. They also serve to inform players of what needs to be done next.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/>\n\nThe game includes a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode where up to four players can compete against each other in seven different game types: Beach, Raptor, Heist, War, Tank, Race and Deathmatch.<ref name=\"IGN guide multiplayer\"/> In Beach, a team of players must go up through a beach and into a waiting escape vehicle, while another must stop them by firing at them from fixed positions.<ref name=\"manual\" /> Raptor involves a team of players controlling raptors to feed a baby dinosaur while another controlling cavemen who have to steal dinosaur eggs.<ref name=\"manual\" /> Heist engrosses players in the robbery of a bank, where the goal is to retrieve a cash bag from the centre of the level and run with it to the team's vault without being damaged.<ref name=\"manual\" /> War can either be a traditional [[Capture the flag#Software and games|capture the flag]] mode or Total War, where players have to get the other team's gas canister and use it to release a chemical gas that annihilates the enemy.<ref name=\"manual\" /> In Tank, players fight using tanks and chemical canisters that release a lethal gas.<ref name=\"manual\" /> Race is a [[Racing video game|racing]] mode which provides two variations of the same course. Items can be acquired and used against opponents.<ref name=\"manual\" /> Finally, Deathmatch is a standard [[deathmatch]] mode where players fight against each other in shooting style from a [[Virtual camera system|third-person perspective]].<ref name=\"manual\" /> Players can set multiple options for each game, such as score limit, number of lives, and inclusion of computer-controlled [[Video game bot|bots]].<ref name=\"IGN guide multiplayer\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' follows the story of Conker the Squirrel, a [[red squirrel]] who embarks on a quest to return home to his girlfriend, Berri, after a night of [[binge drinking]] with his friends.<ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/> Meanwhile, the Panther King, ruler of the land that Conker is lost in, finds that his throne's side table is missing one of its legs and orders his servant, Professor Von Kriplespac, to solve the problem.<ref name=\"table problem\"/> When Von Kriplespac suggests the use of a red squirrel as the fourth leg of his table, the Panther King sends his minions to capture one.<ref name=\"red squirrel\"/> During his quest to return home, Conker finds wads of cash scattered throughout the land and becomes sidetracked from his goal. This leads him to embroil himself in a series of increasingly absurd and often dangerous situations, including having to recover a bee hive from enormous wasps, confronting a giant opera-singing pile of [[feces]], and getting drafted into a war between grey squirrels and a [[Nazism|Nazi]]-like group of [[teddy bear]]s known as the Tediz, which Conker ultimately destroys.<ref name=\"Tediz\" />\n\nWhen Conker finds Berri, Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, enlists their help in robbing a bank.<ref name=\"heist\"/> After entering the vault, Conker and Berri find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the Panther King to capture Conker.<ref name=\"trap\"/> While confronting the Panther King and Von Kriplespac, Berri is gunned down by Weaso. Afterwards, a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorph]]-like creature creature bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the creature is one of his creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the Panther King and escape his captivity.<ref name=\"alien\"/> He then reveals that they are inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs the creature to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations.<ref name=\"Tediz\"/> Conker kills Kriplespac by opening an airlock which sucks both Kriplespac and Berri's corpse into space, and then battles the alien with the aid of a robotic suit. The game then suddenly [[Hang (computing)|freezes]], and Conker expresses disbelief that Rare did not [[Debugging|test]] the game properly. Asking for the programmers' assistance,<ref name=\"beta test\"/> the programmers give Conker a [[katana]] and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates the alien. Conker is then crowned the new king of the land.\n\nAs the King, Conker realises that he should have brought Berri back to life when he was negotiating with the programmers. He then calls out to bring her back to life, only to realise that the programmers have already left.<ref name=\"Berri dead\"/> Conker gives a closing [[monologue]], in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always wanting more, stating that \"the grass is always greener, and you don't really know what it is you have until it's gone.\"<ref name=\"ending scene\"/> After the credits roll, Conker is seen back at the same pub he was seen in at the start of the game. As it begins to storm outside, he drunkenly exits the bar, leaving in the opposite direction he took previously.\n\n==Development==\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was developed by Rare and directed by Chris Seavor.<ref name=\"Metacritic Seavor\"/> The game was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in June 1997, under the title ''Conker's Quest''.<ref name=\"Conker E3\"/><ref name=GProE3/> A year later, it was revealed that the game's title was changed to ''Twelve Tales: Conker 64'' and players would be able to control Conker in action-based settings and Berri in strategy-based settings, with the possibility of two-player [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] gameplay.<ref name=\"Conker 64 gameplay\"/> Early screenshots suggested that the game would be targeted at a family audience and feature cute characters and colourful settings. Although Rare had a history of making games of this sort, the company was influenced by the critical reception of the prototype game's cuteness, resulting in a game design overhaul.<ref name=\"New names\"/> Multiple delays and a lack of updates led to speculation that it had been quietly cancelled.<ref name=\"Delays\"/> Rare later clarified that the game was \"still being worked on by a full team and with the same level of dedication as when it was first announced.\"<ref name=\"Conker update\"/>\n\nIn 2000, it was announced that ''Conker'' had been retooled into ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' with a large amount of [[scatological humour]].<ref name=\"GS update\"/><ref name=\"IGN more proof\"/> According to the developers, \"We already had the main character (although he was eventually remodeled) and a good deal of code already written, so the best option seemed to be to change the game's direction. Mature humor was a key element.\"<ref name=\"amazon\"/> Several aspects of the game were designed to attract an adult audience. Item collecting was mostly discarded and character abilities were simplified with \"context sensitive\" pads.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> The game also relies heavily on [[cutscene]]s and features a large number of film [[Parody|parodies]].<ref name=\"IGN review\" /> Some offensive content was cut by Nintendo, the game's publisher, including cutscenes with ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' and a joke at the expense of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name=\"kotaku\"/> Seavor, however, remarked that \"pretty much 99.9% of the game content remained.\"<ref name=\"kotaku\"/>\n\nIn 2013, the developers explained that they had originally drawn inspiration from their deep analysis of the gameplay and camera mechanics of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.<ref name=\"CBFD Director's Pt7\"/>{{rp|8:10}} A lot of time and care was spent on system performance optimisation, animation details, and audiovisual appeal. To increase the number of simultaneous light sources to four, one programmer spent four months deciphering and rewriting the Nintendo-supplied Japanese-commented [[microcode]] for the Nintendo 64's [[Reality Coprocessor]], while another microcoded the support for [[MP3]], [[reverberation]], and [[Dolby Pro Logic]] surround sound.<ref name=\"CBFD Director's Pt10\"/>{{rp|0:40}} A developer also spent weeks optimising the system's ability to display distant backdrops as texture tiles to enhance gameplay navigation and visual appeal.<ref name=\"CBFD Director's Pt7\"/>{{rp|10:10}} Due in part to its extensive vocal track, ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is one of the few Nintendo 64 games that features a 64[[Megabyte|MB]] [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]].<ref name=\"64 MB\"/>\n\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was first released on 5 March 2001 in North America.<ref name=\"Europe THQ\"/> Advertisements for the game were featured in adult magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'',<ref name=\"Playboy\"/> and video commercials were geared towards an adult audience.<ref name=\"Commercial\"/> Because Nintendo was known for its family-friendly games, ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was the subject of controversy. According to Rare, \"Nintendo initially had concerns regarding this issue, because kids might confuse the product as being aimed at them. \"<ref name=\"amazon\"/> Nintendo of America declined to acknowledge the game in its ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine and [[KB Toys]], which specialised in toys and video games for children, decided not to sell the game.<ref name=\"KB Toys\"/> In Europe, the game was published and distributed by [[THQ]] on 13 April 2001,<ref name=\"N64 review\"/> after Nintendo of Europe declined to publish it.<ref name=\"Europe THQ\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Allgame review\"/>\n| Edge = 7/10<ref name=\"Edge review\"/>\n| GamePro = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"GamePro review\"/>\n| GameRev = B+<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\" />\n| GSpot = 9.3/10<ref name=\"GameSpot review\" />\n| IGN = 9.9/10<ref name=\"IGN review\" />\n| N64 = 89%<ref name=\"N64 review\"/>\n| NGen = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen review\"/>\n| NLife = 9/10<ref name=\"NLife review\"/>\n| rev1 = [[Gameplanet (New Zealand)|Gameplanet]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"Gameplanet review\" />\n| GR = 89.28% (33 reviews)<ref name=\"GameRankings\"/>\n| MC = 92/100 (19 reviews)<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n}}\n\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' received critical acclaim, with an aggregate review score of 92 out of 100 at [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> Many publications and websites declared the graphics were the best on the Nintendo 64.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/><ref name=\"Gameplanet review\"/> Critics noted that the game featured a number of technical effects that were uncommon at the time, especially for a Nintendo 64 game, such as dynamic shadowing, coloured lighting, large areas with a long [[draw distance]], no [[distance fog]], detailed facial animations, [[lip syncing]], and individually rendered fingers on some characters.<ref name=\"IGN review\" /> ''[[GameSpot]]'' went so far as to say that the game \"makes other Nintendo 64 games look like [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] software.\"<ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/> ''[[IGN]]'' editor [[Matt Casamassina]] praised the detailed 3D worlds, \"fantastic\" texture work, and cute character designs. He remarked that \"Conker himself is equipped with an in-game facial animation system that realistically portrays his different moods as he travels the lands. When he's scared, he looks [like] it, and when he's pissed off players will actually be able to see his teeth showing in a frown.\"<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> Reviewers noted occasional [[frame rate]] drops, but most agreed they did not interfere with the gameplay.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nThe game's audio and diverse vocal track were widely praised.<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\"/> Critics credited the voice acting for its different accents and styles, with \"cleverly lewd\" scripts and \"dead-on\" movie spoofs.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/> Most reviewers agreed the jokes were clever and funny.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/><ref name=\"Game Revolution review\"/> According to Casamassina, \"Is it over the top? Yes. Is it lowbrow? Yes. And yet, it's also very well delivered and smart too -- and it's funny. Really, honestly, funny\".<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> [[Game Revolution]] noted that the game \"has its crosshairs directly aimed at the college audience\" and that \"it works perfectly for the peeps who've grown up with [[Mario]] and are now looking for someone less dorky\".<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\"/> The soundtrack was praised for its different arrangements of specific songs that gradually change as players move from one area to the next, and for its rich and creative instrumentation.<ref name=\"GameSpot review\" /><ref name=\"Game Revolution review\" /> Reviewers also highlighted the number of sound effects, with ''GameSpot'' noting that \"there are literally dozens of sounds just for Conker's footsteps\".<ref name=\"GameSpot review\" />\n\nThe gameplay was highlighted for its unconventional context-sensitive pads. ''IGN'' noted that they \"help keep the action shifting, refreshing, and always exciting\", and credited Rare for reducing the number of items to collect.<ref name=\"IGN review\" /> However, ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' remarked that the pads make ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' \"little more than a procession of barely connected and puerile minigames\",<ref name=\"Edge review\"/> while ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' felt that many puzzles lack logical coherence and that solving them involves a lot of [[trial and error]].<ref name=\"NGen review\"/> Criticism was also targeted at the game's erratic camera system, simplistic action, short length and linear nature.<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\" /><ref name=\"N64 review\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/> ''[[N64 Magazine]]'' felt that camera system does not allow players to properly judge their position within their surroundings,<ref name=\"N64 review\"/> while ''GameSpot'' remarked that it can get caught on objects or refuse to obey commands.<ref name=\"GameSpot review\" /> Although the multiplayer was considered inventive and was praised for its numerous options,<ref name=\"IGN review\"/><ref name=\"Gameplanet review\" /> adding longevity to the game, ''GameSpot'' stated that most modes \"fail to stand the test of time.\"<ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/>\n\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was awarded the 2001 [[BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards|BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award]] for sound,<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> ''IGN''{{'}}s Game of the Month for March 2001,<ref name=\"Games of March\"/> and ''GameSpot''{{'}}s Best Platform Game for 2001.<ref name=\"GS Best Platform Game\"/> In 2009, ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' placed ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' at #97 on their list of 100 Greatest Nintendo Games Ever,<ref name=\"Best Nintendo Games Ever\"/> and [[GameTrailers]] ranked it #1 on their list of Top Ten Funniest Games.<ref name=\"GT Top Ten Funniest Games\"/> In 2010, [[UGO Networks|UGO]] included the game at #3 on their list of The 11 Weirdest Game Endings.<ref name=\"The 11 Weirdest Game Endings\"/> Although the game fared well with critics, it was not a commercial success, selling only about 55,000 copies within its first month of release.<ref name=\"sales\"/> Reasons can be attributed to its prohibitively high cost, advertisements exclusive to the older audience, and release near the end of the Nintendo 64.<ref name=\"sales\"/><ref name=\"Final N64 days\"/> The game has since enjoyed a [[cult following]] due to its unique styling.<ref name=\"cult\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter the release of ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'', Rare began development of a direct sequel referred to as ''Conker's Other Bad Day''.<ref name=\"otherbadday\"/><ref name=\"ryan\"/> Chris Seavor revealed that the game would deal with \"Conker's somewhat unsuccessful tenure as King. He spends all the treasured money on beer, parties and hookers. Thrown into prison, Conker is faced with the prospect of execution and the game starts with his escape, ball and chain attached, from the Castle's highest tower.\"<ref name=\"otherbadday\"/> In 2002, however, Rare was purchased by [[Microsoft]], who told them they were not interested in such a project.<ref name=\"otherbadday\"/>\n\nA [[video game remake|remake]] of ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'', titled ''[[Conker: Live & Reloaded]]'', was ultimately released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in 2005 to generally favourable critical reception.<ref name=\"Conker: Live and Reloaded preview\"/><ref name=\"Conker: Live and Reloaded reviews\"/> Developers noted that it was difficult to [[Porting|port]] the game to the Xbox system because ''Bad Fur Day''{{'}}s microcoded performance optimisations had been deeply customised for the Nintendo 64 hardware.<ref name=\"CBFD Director's Pt10\"/>{{rp|2:25}} ''Conker: Live & Reloaded'' features updated graphics and a multiplayer mode that supports the [[Xbox Live]] service. Additionally, some aspects in the single-player mode were adjusted: several minor obscenities within the voice dialogue that are present in the Nintendo 64 game were censored at Microsoft's request,<ref name=\"Conker: Live and Reloaded changes\"/> the camera control was refined and improved with a zoom function, and an auto-targeting system was added to the game.<ref name=\"Conker: Live and Reloaded changes\" />\n\nAfter the release of ''Live & Reloaded'', Rare began work on another game in the ''Conker'' universe titled ''Conker: Gettin' Medieval''. The game was to be multiplayer focused and did not feature Conker as a main character, with Rare instead hoping to focus on other characters in the series. However, the game was ultimately cancelled.<ref name=\"Gettin' Medieval\"/> Conker returned in a new episodic campaign for the [[Sandbox game|sandbox]] game ''[[Project Spark]]''. The campaign, titled ''Conker's Big Reunion'', is set ten years after the events of ''Bad Fur Day'' and Seavor reprised his voice roles.<ref name=\"Big Reunion\"/> The first episode of the campaign was released in April 2015, but the remaining ones were cancelled the following September.<ref name=\"Big Reunion no more episodes\"/> ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is also included as part of the ''[[Rare Replay]]'' compilation for [[Xbox One]], marking the original game's first official re-release. The compilation was released on August 4, 2015.<ref name=\"Rare Replay\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--CITE VIDEO GAME-->\n\n<ref name=\"table problem\">{{cite video game |title=Conker's Bad Fur Day |developer=[[Rare (company)|Rare]] |level=Windy Part 1 |quote='''Panther King''': Ah.

As part of the ''[[Conker (series)|Conker]]'' series, the game follows the story of [[Conker the Squirrel]], a greedy, heavy-drinking [[red squirrel]] who must return home to his girlfriend. Most of the game requires the player to complete a linear sequence of challenges that involve jumping over obstacles, solving [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]], and fighting enemies. A [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode where up to four players can compete against each other in seven different game types is also included. Designed for mature audiences, ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' features [[graphic violence]], [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] use, [[profanity]], [[Off-color humor|vulgar humor]], and [[popular culture|pop culture]] references.\n\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was developed over the course of four years. Although it was originally designed for a family audience, the game was retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]''. Upon release, ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was acclaimed by video game critics, who praised its visual appeal and smart humour. The game sold well below expectations due to limited advertising and a release towards the end of the Nintendo 64's life cycle, but has since earned a [[cult following]]. A [[Video game remake|remake]], ''[[Conker: Live & Reloaded]]'', was released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in 2005. In 2015, the game was included as part of the ''[[Rare Replay]]'' compilation for [[Xbox One]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:CBFD-graphics.jpg|left|thumb|The player can travel from one [[Level (video gaming)|level]] to another through the game's [[overworld]]. Each area has a distinct colour theme.]]\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is a [[Platform game|platformer]] [[video game]] where the player controls [[Conker the Squirrel]] through a series of three-dimensional [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].<ref name=\"IGN review\" /> The game features an [[overworld]] where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/> Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], solving [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]], gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/>\n\nAs compared to the player characters in [[Rare (company)|Rare]]'s previous platform games ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', Conker's abilities are simpler.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/> The player can run, jump, and smack enemies with a [[frying pan]]. Conker can also swim underwater for a limited period of time, climb ladders or ropes, and push objects.<ref name=\"manual\"/> To regain lost health, Conker can eat pieces of \"anti-gravity\" Chocolate that are scattered throughout the levels.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/> The game employs \"[[Context-sensitive user interface|context sensitive]]\" pads that allow Conker to gain different, temporary abilities when pressing the \"[[Nintendo 64 controller|B]]\" button atop them.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/> For instance, in the beginning of the game, by pressing the B button on the first pad he encounters, Conker drinks some [[Alka-Seltzer]] to wipe out his hangover, at which point players can proceed forward. Some pads can turn Conker into an anvil to slam into the ground, while others pull out his shotgun, throwing knives, and [[slingshot]]. They also serve to inform players of what needs to be done next.<ref name=\"IGN guide basics\"/>\n\nThe game includes a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode where up to four players can compete against each other in seven different game types: Beach, Raptor, Heist, War, Tank, Race and Deathmatch.<ref name=\"IGN guide multiplayer\"/> In Beach, a team of players must go up through a beach and into a waiting escape vehicle, while another must stop them by firing at them from fixed positions.<ref name=\"manual\" /> Raptor involves a team of players controlling raptors to feed a baby dinosaur while another controlling cavemen who have to steal dinosaur eggs.<ref name=\"manual\" /> Heist engrosses players in the robbery of a bank, where the goal is to retrieve a cash bag from the centre of the level and run with it to the team's vault without being damaged.<ref name=\"manual\" /> War can either be a traditional [[Capture the flag#Software and games|capture the flag]] mode or Total War, where players have to get the other team's gas canister and use it to release a chemical gas that annihilates the enemy.<ref name=\"manual\" /> In Tank, players fight using tanks and chemical canisters that release a lethal gas.<ref name=\"manual\" /> Race is a [[Racing video game|racing]] mode which provides two variations of the same course. Items can be acquired and used against opponents.<ref name=\"manual\" /> Finally, Deathmatch is a standard [[deathmatch]] mode where players fight against each other in shooting style from a [[Virtual camera system|third-person perspective]].<ref name=\"manual\" /> Players can set multiple options for each game, such as score limit, number of lives, and inclusion of computer-controlled [[Video game bot|bots]].<ref name=\"IGN guide multiplayer\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' follows the story of Conker the Squirrel, a [[red squirrel]] who embarks on a quest to return home to his girlfriend, Berri, after a night of [[binge drinking]] with his friends.<ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/> Meanwhile, the Panther King, ruler of the land that Conker is lost in, finds that his throne's side table is missing one of its legs and orders his servant, Professor Von Kriplespac, to solve the problem.<ref name=\"table problem\"/> When Von Kriplespac suggests the use of a red squirrel as the fourth leg of his table, the Panther King sends his minions to capture one.<ref name=\"red squirrel\"/> During his quest to return home, Conker finds wads of cash scattered throughout the land and becomes sidetracked from his goal. This leads him to embroil himself in a series of increasingly absurd and often dangerous situations, including having to recover a bee hive from enormous wasps, confronting a giant opera-singing pile of [[feces]], and getting drafted into a war between grey squirrels and a [[Nazism|Nazi]]-like group of [[teddy bear]]s known as the Tediz, which Conker ultimately destroys.<ref name=\"Tediz\" />\n\nWhen Conker finds Berri, Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, enlists their help in robbing a bank.<ref name=\"heist\"/> After entering the vault, Conker and Berri find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the Panther King to capture Conker.<ref name=\"trap\"/> While confronting the Panther King and Von Kriplespac, Berri is gunned down by Weaso. Afterwards, a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorph]]-like creature creature bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the creature is one of his creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the Panther King and escape his captivity.<ref name=\"alien\"/> He then reveals that they are inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs the creature to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations.<ref name=\"Tediz\"/> Conker kills Kriplespac by opening an airlock which sucks both Kriplespac and Berri's corpse into space, and then battles the alien with the aid of a robotic suit. The game then suddenly [[Hang (computing)|freezes]], and Conker expresses disbelief that Rare did not [[Debugging|test]] the game properly. Asking for the programmers' assistance,<ref name=\"beta test\"/> the programmers give Conker a [[katana]] and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates the alien. Conker is then crowned the new king of the land.\n\nAs the King, Conker realises that he should have brought Berri back to life when he was negotiating with the programmers. He then calls out to bring her back to life, only to realise that the programmers have already left.<ref name=\"Berri dead\"/> Conker gives a closing [[monologue]], in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always wanting more, stating that \"the grass is always greener, and you don't really know what it is you have until it's gone.\"<ref name=\"ending scene\"/> After the credits roll, Conker is seen back at the same pub he was seen in at the start of the game. As it begins to storm outside, he drunkenly exits the bar, leaving in the opposite direction he took previously.\n\n==Development==\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was developed by Rare and directed by Chris Seavor.<ref name=\"Metacritic Seavor\"/> The game was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in June 1997, under the title ''Conker's Quest''.<ref name=\"Conker E3\"/><ref name=GProE3/> A year later, it was revealed that the game's title was changed to ''Twelve Tales: Conker 64'' and players would be able to control Conker in action-based settings and Berri in strategy-based settings, with the possibility of two-player [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] gameplay.<ref name=\"Conker 64 gameplay\"/> Early screenshots suggested that the game would be targeted at a family audience and feature cute characters and colourful settings. Although Rare had a history of making games of this sort, the company was influenced by the critical reception of the prototype game's cuteness, resulting in a game design overhaul.<ref name=\"New names\"/> Multiple delays and a lack of updates led to speculation that it had been quietly cancelled.<ref name=\"Delays\"/> Rare later clarified that the game was \"still being worked on by a full team and with the same level of dedication as when it was first announced.\"<ref name=\"Conker update\"/>\n\nIn 2000, it was announced that ''Conker'' had been retooled into ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' with a large amount of [[scatological humour]].<ref name=\"GS update\"/><ref name=\"IGN more proof\"/> According to the developers, \"We already had the main character (although he was eventually remodeled) and a good deal of code already written, so the best option seemed to be to change the game's direction. Mature humor was a key element.\"<ref name=\"amazon\"/> Several aspects of the game were designed to attract an adult audience. Item collecting was mostly discarded and character abilities were simplified with \"context sensitive\" pads.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> The game also relies heavily on [[cutscene]]s and features a large number of film [[Parody|parodies]].<ref name=\"IGN review\" /> Some offensive content was cut by Nintendo, the game's publisher, including cutscenes with ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' and a joke at the expense of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name=\"kotaku\"/> Seavor, however, remarked that \"pretty much 99.9% of the game content remained.\"<ref name=\"kotaku\"/>\n\nIn 2013, the developers explained that they had originally drawn inspiration from their deep analysis of the gameplay and camera mechanics of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.<ref name=\"CBFD Director's Pt7\"/>{{rp|8:10}} A lot of time and care was spent on system performance optimisation, animation details, and audiovisual appeal. To increase the number of simultaneous light sources to four, one programmer spent four months deciphering and rewriting the Nintendo-supplied Japanese-commented [[microcode]] for the Nintendo 64's [[Reality Coprocessor]], while another microcoded the support for [[MP3]], [[reverberation]], and [[Dolby Pro Logic]] surround sound.<ref name=\"CBFD Director's Pt10\"/>{{rp|0:40}} A developer also spent weeks optimising the system's ability to display distant backdrops as texture tiles to enhance gameplay navigation and visual appeal.<ref name=\"CBFD Director's Pt7\"/>{{rp|10:10}} Due in part to its extensive vocal track, ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is one of the few Nintendo 64 games that features a 64[[Megabyte|MB]] [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]].<ref name=\"64 MB\"/>\n\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was first released on 5 March 2001 in North America.<ref name=\"Europe THQ\"/> Advertisements for the game were featured in adult magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'',<ref name=\"Playboy\"/> and video commercials were geared towards an adult audience.<ref name=\"Commercial\"/> Because Nintendo was known for its family-friendly games, ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was the subject of controversy. According to Rare, \"Nintendo initially had concerns regarding this issue, because kids might confuse the product as being aimed at them. \"<ref name=\"amazon\"/> Nintendo of America declined to acknowledge the game in its ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine and [[KB Toys]], which specialised in toys and video games for children, decided not to sell the game.<ref name=\"KB Toys\"/> In Europe, the game was published and distributed by [[THQ]] on 13 April 2001,<ref name=\"N64 review\"/> after Nintendo of Europe declined to publish it.<ref name=\"Europe THQ\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Allgame review\"/>\n| Edge = 7/10<ref name=\"Edge review\"/>\n| GamePro = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"GamePro review\"/>\n| GameRev = B+<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\" />\n| GSpot = 9.3/10<ref name=\"GameSpot review\" />\n| IGN = 9.9/10<ref name=\"IGN review\" />\n| N64 = 89%<ref name=\"N64 review\"/>\n| NGen = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen review\"/>\n| NLife = 9/10<ref name=\"NLife review\"/>\n| rev1 = [[Gameplanet (New Zealand)|Gameplanet]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"Gameplanet review\" />\n| GR = 89.28% (33 reviews)<ref name=\"GameRankings\"/>\n| MC = 92/100 (19 reviews)<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n}}\n\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' received critical acclaim, with an aggregate review score of 92 out of 100 at [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> Many publications and websites declared the graphics were the best on the Nintendo 64.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/><ref name=\"Gameplanet review\"/> Critics noted that the game featured a number of technical effects that were uncommon at the time, especially for a Nintendo 64 game, such as dynamic shadowing, coloured lighting, large areas with a long [[draw distance]], no [[distance fog]], detailed facial animations, [[lip syncing]], and individually rendered fingers on some characters.<ref name=\"IGN review\" /> ''[[GameSpot]]'' went so far as to say that the game \"makes other Nintendo 64 games look like [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] software.\"<ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/> ''[[IGN]]'' editor [[Matt Casamassina]] praised the detailed 3D worlds, \"fantastic\" texture work, and cute character designs. He remarked that \"Conker himself is equipped with an in-game facial animation system that realistically portrays his different moods as he travels the lands. When he's scared, he looks [like] it, and when he's pissed off players will actually be able to see his teeth showing in a frown.\"<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> Reviewers noted occasional [[frame rate]] drops, but most agreed they did not interfere with the gameplay.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nThe game's audio and diverse vocal track were widely praised.<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\"/> Critics credited the voice acting for its different accents and styles, with \"cleverly lewd\" scripts and \"dead-on\" movie spoofs.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/> Most reviewers agreed the jokes were clever and funny.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/><ref name=\"Game Revolution review\"/> According to Casamassina, \"Is it over the top? Yes. Is it lowbrow? Yes. And yet, it's also very well delivered and smart too -- and it's funny. Really, honestly, funny\".<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> [[Game Revolution]] noted that the game \"has its crosshairs directly aimed at the college audience\" and that \"it works perfectly for the peeps who've grown up with [[Mario]] and are now looking for someone less dorky\".<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\"/> The soundtrack was praised for its different arrangements of specific songs that gradually change as players move from one area to the next, and for its rich and creative instrumentation.<ref name=\"GameSpot review\" /><ref name=\"Game Revolution review\" /> Reviewers also highlighted the number of sound effects, with ''GameSpot'' noting that \"there are literally dozens of sounds just for Conker's footsteps\".<ref name=\"GameSpot review\" />\n\nThe gameplay was highlighted for its unconventional context-sensitive pads. ''IGN'' noted that they \"help keep the action shifting, refreshing, and always exciting\", and credited Rare for reducing the number of items to collect.<ref name=\"IGN review\" /> However, ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' remarked that the pads make ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' \"little more than a procession of barely connected and puerile minigames\",<ref name=\"Edge review\"/> while ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' felt that many puzzles lack logical coherence and that solving them involves a lot of [[trial and error]].<ref name=\"NGen review\"/> Criticism was also targeted at the the game's erratic camera system, simplistic action, short length and linear nature.<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\" /><ref name=\"N64 review\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/> ''[[N64 Magazine]]'' felt that camera system does not allow players to properly judge their position within their surroundings,<ref name=\"N64 review\"/> while ''GameSpot'' remarked that it can get caught on objects or refuse to obey commands.<ref name=\"GameSpot review\" /> Although the multiplayer was considered inventive and was praised for its numerous options,<ref name=\"IGN review\"/><ref name=\"Gameplanet review\" /> adding longevity to the game, ''GameSpot'' stated that most modes \"fail to stand the test of time.\"<ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/>\n\n''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' was awarded the 2001 [[BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards|BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award]] for sound,<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> ''IGN''{{'}}s Game of the Month for March 2001,<ref name=\"Games of March\"/> and ''GameSpot''{{'}}s Best Platform Game for 2001.<ref name=\"GS Best Platform Game\"/> In 2009, ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' placed ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' at #97 on their list of 100 Greatest Nintendo Games Ever,<ref name=\"Best Nintendo Games Ever\"/> and [[GameTrailers]] ranked it #1 on their list of Top Ten Funniest Games.<ref name=\"GT Top Ten Funniest Games\"/> In 2010, [[UGO Networks|UGO]] included the game at #3 on their list of The 11 Weirdest Game Endings.<ref name=\"The 11 Weirdest Game Endings\"/> Although the game fared well with critics, it was not a commercial success, selling only about 55,000 copies within its first month of release.<ref name=\"sales\"/> Reasons can be attributed to its prohibitively high cost, advertisements exclusive to the older audience, and release near the end of the Nintendo 64.<ref name=\"sales\"/><ref name=\"Final N64 days\"/> The game has since enjoyed a [[cult following]] due to its unique styling.<ref name=\"cult\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter the release of ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'', Rare began development of a direct sequel referred to as ''Conker's Other Bad Day''.<ref name=\"otherbadday\"/><ref name=\"ryan\"/> Chris Seavor revealed that the game would deal with \"Conker's somewhat unsuccessful tenure as King. He spends all the treasured money on beer, parties and hookers. Thrown into prison, Conker is faced with the prospect of execution and the game starts with his escape, ball and chain attached, from the Castle's highest tower.\"<ref name=\"otherbadday\"/> In 2002, however, Rare was purchased by [[Microsoft]], who told them they were not interested in such a project.<ref name=\"otherbadday\"/>\n\nA [[video game remake|remake]] of ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'', titled ''[[Conker: Live & Reloaded]]'', was ultimately released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in 2005 to generally favourable critical reception.<ref name=\"Conker: Live and Reloaded preview\"/><ref name=\"Conker: Live and Reloaded reviews\"/> Developers noted that it was difficult to [[Porting|port]] the game to the Xbox system because ''Bad Fur Day''{{'}}s microcoded performance optimisations had been deeply customised for the Nintendo 64 hardware.<ref name=\"CBFD Director's Pt10\"/>{{rp|2:25}} ''Conker: Live & Reloaded'' features updated graphics and a multiplayer mode that supports the [[Xbox Live]] service. Additionally, some aspects in the single-player mode were adjusted: several minor obscenities within the voice dialogue that are present in the Nintendo 64 game were censored at Microsoft's request,<ref name=\"Conker: Live and Reloaded changes\"/> the camera control was refined and improved with a zoom function, and an auto-targeting system was added to the game.<ref name=\"Conker: Live and Reloaded changes\" />\n\nAfter the release of ''Live & Reloaded'', Rare began work on another game in the ''Conker'' universe titled ''Conker: Gettin' Medieval''. The game was to be multiplayer focused and did not feature Conker as a main character, with Rare instead hoping to focus on other characters in the series. However, the game was ultimately cancelled.<ref name=\"Gettin' Medieval\"/> Conker returned in a new episodic campaign for the [[Sandbox game|sandbox]] game ''[[Project Spark]]''. The campaign, titled ''Conker's Big Reunion'', is set ten years after the events of ''Bad Fur Day'' and Seavor reprised his voice roles.<ref name=\"Big Reunion\"/> The first episode of the campaign was released in April 2015, but the remaining ones were cancelled the following September.<ref name=\"Big Reunion no more episodes\"/> ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is also included as part of the ''[[Rare Replay]]'' compilation for [[Xbox One]], marking the original game's first official re-release.

In 1955 Van Kampen joined the Institute of Theoretical Physics at [[Utrecht University]], where he later became full professor and professor emeritus after his retirement.<ref>Rosalio F.

Her latest film credit is [[Rob Zombie]]'s ''[[The Lords of Salem (film)|The Lords of Salem]]'' (2012).\n\nIn 2000, Quinn recorded the song \"Guts To Dream\" with [[London]]-based band [[The Grand (band)|The Grand]]. The song was due to form part of an [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''Open Displays of Affection'', but the group had disbanded before it was released. Quinn gave a copy of the unreleased CD to the winner of a Magenta costume contest at the ''Rocky Horror Picture Show'' 25th Anniversary Convention in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].\n\nIn 2002, she returned to ''[[Doctor Who]]'', playing an alien queen in the [[audio drama|audio play]] ''[[Bang-Bang-a-Boom!]]''. In September 2006, she re-launched her career as a [[DJ]] and club kitten, hosting the monthly \"Club Myra\" night at various venues in [[Central London]].

She attended a ''Rocky Horror Picture Show'' convention in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] in July 2011, answering questions as well as introducing a performance of the show, staged at the [[House of Blues]].\n\nIn May 2013, she served as the honorary Master of Ceremonies for a ''Rocky Horror Picture Show'' performance hosted by [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] shadowcasting troupe ''Amber Does Dallas'' while attending the [[Texas Frightmare Weekend]] horror convention.<ref>{{YouTube|paydZcb3kjI}}</ref> That same month, she was the guest of honor at a \"40th Anniversary Tribute Concert\" to the original ''Rocky Horror Show'' stage production, hosted at the [[Victoria Theatre (San Francisco)|Victoria Theatre]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] by local drag celebrity [[Peaches Christ]]. During the tribute conference, Quinn performed \"Science Fiction/Double Feature\", answered questions on stage with Christ, and signed autographs for the audience.\n\n==Personal life==\nQuinn was born in [[Belfast]] in [[Northern Ireland]], to James Connolly Quinn, a [[bookmaker]], and his wife Rebecca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://patriciaquinn.co.uk/bio|title=Biography - Patricia Quinn|work=patriciaquinn.co.uk}}</ref> She attended the Princess Gardens Grammar School, where she developed an early talent for acting. Following stints at Belfast\u2019s Arts Theatre and British Drama League, she left for London aged 17. In 1969, she trained at the [[Drama Centre London]] while simultaneously working as a [[blackjack]]-dealing [[Playboy Bunny|Bunny]] at the [[Playboy Club]] in [[Mayfair]]. In 1971, she was in repertory for six months with the [[Citizens Theatre]] in [[Glasgow]].\n\nShe has a son, Quinn Hawkins, from her first marriage to Don Hawkins.

E. M. Archer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Work==\nFairbairn's works include: ''Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality'' (1952) and ''From Instinct to Self: Selected Papers of W. R. D.

Rinsley, ''Fairbairn and the Origins of Object Relations'' (1994), an edited study by Neil J. Skolnik and David E. Scharff, ''Fairbairn Then and Now'' (1998), a text by David Celani which is an application of Fairbairn's model  to domestic violence, ''The Illusion of Love:Why The Battered Woman Returns to Her Abuser'' (1994) , and a second text by Celani on the application of  Fairbairn's model to the treatment of severe personality disorders,  ''Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting'', (2010).\n\n===Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality (1952)===\n\n''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'' (1952) is a collection of papers previously published in different psychoanalytic journals. The book is divided into three parts, the first being mostly theoretical, the second one clinical, and the third one concerning more general problems. The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts. The importance of Fairbain's work lies in the fact that it was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis. Farbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant was suffused with primitive drives that needed to be tamed, but rather that the infant was seeking love  and support that would allow him to develop and explore the world securely, knowing that he was backed up by parents who were ready to help him if he was overwhelmed. Fairbairn's model offers a different  theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the dynamics of personality, as well as the origins of psychopathology. Finally, he offers a different approach to  the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his ambitious goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model. His model is still classified as a psychoanalytic model as it assumed that the fundamental source of human motivation came from the unconscious, and it focuses on the sources of transference, repetition compulsions and resistance. Finally, it shifted the Freudian emphasis away from repression and back to dissociation as the fundamental defense mechanism used by humans. Greenberg and Mitchell  noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn's new vision of the human psyche. <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>'''Freud's psychoanalytic model''' is a '''drive/structure  model'''  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating)  comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on  in development (via the Oedipal Conflict) the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures: The Id, Ego and Super Ego, mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct choices.              \n\n'''Fairbairn's model''' is a  '''relational/structure mode'''l in that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and not from the pressure exerted by the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to them. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's under developed central ego to remember.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and faces the loss of his sense of self, as described by Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are unavailable to the individual's central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is ''developed'' (and not a biological inheritance of humankind) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n=== Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940) ===\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having splits in their ego structure. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are:(1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality...So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>He noted that the schizoid condition was due to split off (dissociated) interpersonal experiences which were unknown to the conscious \"central ego\".  The schizoid style of relating (or rather, non-relating) to others originated from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving  emotions,  and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdrew into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out in bold and uncompromising manner as the following quote illustrates:<blockquote>Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation  giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that...he tends to retain his love inside of himself.(c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus Fairbairn saw that the lack of love in a young child's life was traumatic, and also caused splits in his ego. Typically, Fairbairn waited until later in his writing to inform the reader how and why certain material was deleted from the child's memory by dissociation, as the first four papers exposed his thought processes as he worked on and developed his full theory.\n\n=== A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941) ===\nFairbairn gradually formed his model in these first four papers. He  challenged Freud drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become more powerful than Libido Theory.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation) from the parent because of the development of a mature, reality based central ego in the child.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and \n(b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> \n<br /></blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person. The problem lies in the reality that many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure, and are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance \n* (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and \n* (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love.\nIt is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nFairbairn is saying that the dependent child cannot mature without being sure that his parents love and support him, which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, or nearby,  trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to comfort himself by turning inwards to his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available. This is clearly a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances.\n\n==Innovative concepts==\n\n===The object-seeking libido===\nOne of the most important contributions of Fairbairn to the psychoanalytic paradigm is proposing an alternative viewpoint regarding the libido. Whereas [[Freud]] assumed that the [[libido]] is pleasure seeking, Fairbairn thought of the libido as object seeking.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=W.

The first connections a child makes are with his parents. Through diverse forms of contact between the child and his parents, a bond between them is formed. When the bond is formed, the child becomes strongly attached to his parents. This early relationship shapes the emotional life of the child in such a strong way that it determines the emotional experiences that the child will have later on in life, because the early libidinal objects become the prototypes for all later experience of connection with others.\n\n===Internal object relations===\nFairbairn states that the [[object relations]] a child has very early on in life become the child's prototypes for all later experiences regarding connections with others. The internal [[object relations|object relation]] describes a relation which exists in the person's mind. In the normal situation, healthy parenting results in a child with an outward orientation towards real people, who can give real contact and exchange. When the needs of the child are not met by the parents (e.g. [[dependency need]]s and the need for affirmative interactions) a pathological turning away from external reality takes place. Instead of actual exchange with others, fantasised, private presences are established, the so-called internal objects. To these internal objects the child relates in fantasised connections, the internal object relations.\n\n===The splitting of the ego===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called '''dissociation''' was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated, for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The '''Rejecting Object''' in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the '''Antilibidinal Ego'''. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden (2018): \n\n\"Neither the rejecting object nor the '''internal saboteur''' (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) '''the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\", and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego''' that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the '''Ideal Object''') and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents. These rare supportive interactions are enhanced by fantasy and become a second unconscious view of the parent as loving and supportive. This potentially loving fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the '''Exciting Object''' by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the '''Libidinal Ego''' (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets- \n* the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, \n* while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it '''love which is always out of reach.'''\n\nThese two unconscious pairs: \n* The '''Antilibidinal Ego''' that relates to the '''Rejecting Object''', and \n* the '''Libidinal Ego''' that relates only to the '''Exciting Object''' \nare unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. '''Splitting''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects as if they were two different people. When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation, and the resulting fear of abandonment, leads to splitting of the ego, and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects:\n* The '''Central Ego''' relates to the '''Ideal Object'''\n* The '''Antilibidinal Ego''' relates to the '''Rejecting Object'''\n* The '''Libidinal Ego''' relates to the '''Exciting Object'''\n\nThe three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however it never develops beyond this steady state. As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego is losing sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the '''endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object''', and the '''unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes (incorrectly) is stored in their parent (the Exciting Object)'''. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html Structural Model]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairbairn, Ronald}}\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:British psychoanalysts]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychologists]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:People from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Scottish soldiers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:Object relations theorists]]\n[[Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Illusion Of Love: Why The Battered Woman Returns To Her Abuser|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0231100373|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{psychoanalysis}}\n[[File:The Red House, Cluny Gardens.jpg|thumb|Fairbairn's birthplace - The Red House, Cluny Gardens]]\n[[File:Ronald Fairbairn's grave, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|235px|Ronald Fairbairn's grave, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh]]\n'''William Ronald Dodds Fairbairn''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|\u025b\u0259r|b|\u025b\u0259r|n}}) [[FRSE]] (11 August 1889 \u2013 31 December 1964) was a Scottish psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and a central figure in the development of the [[object relations theory]] of psychoanalysis.\n\n==Life==\nRonald Fairbairn was born at the Red House, Cluny Gardens,<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1889-90</ref> in [[Morningside, Edinburgh]] in 1889, the only child of Cecilia Leefe and Thomas Fairbairn, a chartered surveyor, and President of the Edinburgh Architectural Association.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40312|title=Fairbairn, (William) Ronald Dodds (1889\u20131964), psychiatrist and psychoanalyst|last=|first=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40312}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref> He was educated at [[Merchiston Castle School]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he studied for three years in [[divinity]] and [[Hellenic Greek]] studies, graduating MA in 1911.\n\nIn the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Royal Engineers]] and served under [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestinian campaign]], and then the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]].\n\nOn his return to home he began medical training, probably inspired by his war experience.

The book is divided into three parts, the first being mostly theoretical, the second one clinical, and the third one concerning more general problems. The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts. The importance of Fairbain's work lies in the fact that it was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis. Farbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant was suffused with primitive drives that needed to be tamed, but rather that the infant was seeking love  and support that would allow him to develop and explore the world securely, knowing that he was backed up by parents who were ready to help him if he was overwhelmed. Fairbairn's model offers a different  theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the the dynamics of personality, as well as the origins of psychopathology. Finally, he offers a different approach to  the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his ambitious goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model. His model is still classified as a psychoanalytic model as it assumed that the fundamental source of human motivation came from the unconscious, and it focuses on the sources of transference, repetition compulsions and resistance. Finally, it shifted the Freudian emphasis away from repression and back to dissociation as the fundamental defense mechanism used by humans. Greenberg and Mitchell  noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn's new vision of the human psyche. <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>'''Freud's psychoanalytic model''' is a '''drive/structure  model'''  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating)  comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on  in development (via the Oedipal Conflict) the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures: The Id, Ego and Super Ego, mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct choices.              \n\n'''Fairbairn's model''' is a  '''relational/structure mode'''l in that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and not from the pressure exerted by the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to them. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's under developed central ego to remember.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and faces the loss of his sense of self, as described by Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are unavailable to the individual's central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is ''developed'' (and not a biological inheritance of humankind) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n=== Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940) ===\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having splits in their ego structure. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are:(1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality...So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>He noted that the schizoid condition was due to split off (dissociated) interpersonal experiences which were unknown to the conscious \"central ego\".  The schizoid style of relating (or rather, non-relating) to others originated from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving  emotions,  and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdrew into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out in bold and uncompromising manner as the following quote illustrates:<blockquote>Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation  giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that...he tends to retain his love inside of himself.(c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus Fairbairn saw that the lack of love in a young child's life was traumatic, and also caused splits in his ego. Typically, Fairbairn waited until later in his writing to inform the reader how and why certain material was deleted from the child's memory by dissociation, as the first four papers exposed his thought processes as he worked on and developed his full theory.\n\n=== A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941) ===\nFairbairn gradually formed his model in these first four papers. He  challenged Freud drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become more powerful than Libido Theory.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation) from the parent because of the development of a mature, reality based central ego in the child.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and \n(b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> \n<br /></blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person. The problem lies in the reality that many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure, and are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance \n* (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and \n* (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love.\nIt is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nFairbairn is saying that the dependent child cannot mature without being sure that his parents love and support him, which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, or nearby,  trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to comfort himself by turning inwards to his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available. This is clearly a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances.\n\n==Innovative concepts==\n\n===The object-seeking libido===\nOne of the most important contributions of Fairbairn to the psychoanalytic paradigm is proposing an alternative viewpoint regarding the libido. Whereas [[Freud]] assumed that the [[libido]] is pleasure seeking, Fairbairn thought of the libido as object seeking.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=W.

The first connections a child makes are with his parents. Through diverse forms of contact between the child and his parents, a bond between them is formed. When the bond is formed, the child becomes strongly attached to his parents. This early relationship shapes the emotional life of the child in such a strong way that it determines the emotional experiences that the child will have later on in life, because the early libidinal objects become the prototypes for all later experience of connection with others.\n\n===Internal object relations===\nFairbairn states that the [[object relations]] a child has very early on in life become the child's prototypes for all later experiences regarding connections with others. The internal [[object relations|object relation]] describes a relation which exists in the person's mind. In the normal situation, healthy parenting results in a child with an outward orientation towards real people, who can give real contact and exchange. When the needs of the child are not met by the parents (e.g. [[dependency need]]s and the need for affirmative interactions) a pathological turning away from external reality takes place. Instead of actual exchange with others, fantasised, private presences are established, the so-called internal objects. To these internal objects the child relates in fantasised connections, the internal object relations.\n\n===The splitting of the ego===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called '''dissociation''' was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated, for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The '''Rejecting Object''' in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the '''Antilibidinal Ego'''. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden (2018): \n\n\"Neither the rejecting object nor the '''internal saboteur''' (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) '''the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\", and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego''' that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the '''Ideal Object''') and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents. These rare supportive interactions are enhanced by fantasy and become a second unconscious view of the parent as loving and supportive. This potentially loving fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the '''Exciting Object''' by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the '''Libidinal Ego''' (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets- \n* the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, \n* while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it '''love which is always out of reach.'''\n\nThese two unconscious pairs: \n* The '''Antilibidinal Ego''' that relates to the '''Rejecting Object''', and \n* the '''Libidinal Ego''' that relates only to the '''Exciting Object''' \nare unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. '''Splitting''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects as if they were two different people. When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation, and the resulting fear of abandonment, leads to splitting of the ego, and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects:\n* The '''Central Ego''' relates to the '''Ideal Object'''\n* The '''Antilibidinal Ego''' relates to the '''Rejecting Object'''\n* The '''Libidinal Ego''' relates to the '''Exciting Object'''\n\nThe three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however it never develops beyond this steady state. As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego is losing sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the '''endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object''', and the '''unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes (incorrectly) is stored in their parent (the Exciting Object)'''. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html Structural Model]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairbairn, Ronald}}\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:British psychoanalysts]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychologists]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:People from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Scottish soldiers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:Object relations theorists]]\n[[Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fairbairn"}

This large lizard is mainly [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], and its length can range from about 61 to 175&nbsp;cm from the tip of the snout to the end of the tail. Young monitors may be more [[arboreal]], but adults mainly hunt on the ground, [[prey]]ing mainly on [[arthropods]], but also taking small terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s, ground [[bird]]s, [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] and [[fish]]. Although large monitors have few [[predator]]s apart from humans who hunt them for meat, younger individuals are hunted by many predators.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Bengal Monitor (Varanus bengalensis) Juvenile. (28230373818).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|juveniles are patterned and more colourful]]\nThe Bengal monitor can reach 175&nbsp;cm with a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of 75&nbsp;cm and a tail of 100&nbsp;cm. Males are generally larger than females. Heavy individuals may weigh nearly 7.2&nbsp;kg.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):14-15</ref> The populations of monitors in India and Sri Lanka differ in the scalation from those of Myanmar; these were once considered subspecies of the Bengal monitor, but now considered two species within the ''V. bengalensis'' species complex. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=B\u00d6HME|first=WOLFGANG|date=2003-01-01|title=Checklist of the living lizards of the world (family Varanidae)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237517031_Checklist_of_the_living_lizards_of_the_world_family_Varanidae|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology - BMC EVOL BIOL|volume=341}}</ref> What was once the nominate subspecies, ''V. bengalensis'', is found west of Myanmar, while ''[[Clouded monitor|V. nebulosus]]'' is found to the east. ''V. nebulosus'' can be differentiated by the presence of a series of enlarged scales in the supraocular region. The number of ventral scales varies, decreasing from 108 in the west to 75 in the east (Java).<ref>Auffenberg (1994):24</ref>\n[[File:Bengal Monitor at Nagarahole.jpg|left|thumb|adult]]\nYoung monitor lizards are more colourful than adults. Young have a series of dark crossbars on the neck, throat and back. The belly is white, banded with dark crossbars and are spotted with grey or yellow (particularly in the eastern part of the range). On the dorsal surface of young monitors, there are a series of yellow spots with dark transverse bars connecting them. As they mature, the ground colour becomes light brown or grey, and dark spots give them a speckled appearance. Hatchlings of ''V. nebulosus'' by comparison tend to have a series of backward-pointing, V-shaped bands on their necks.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):39</ref>\n\nBengal monitors have external nostril openings (nares) that is slit-like and oriented near horizontal, and positions between the eye and the tip of the snout. The nares can be closed at will, especially to keep away debris or water.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):22</ref> The scales of the skin are rougher in patches and on the sides, they have minute pits, especially well distributed in males.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):36</ref> These scales with micropores have glandular structures in the underlying dermal tissue and produce a secretion which may be a pheromone-like substance. Like other varanids, Bengal monitors have a forked tongue that is protruded in the manner of snakes. The function is mainly sensory, and is not very involved in the transport of food down the throat. Bengal monitors have fat deposits in the tail and body that serve them in conditions when prey are not easily available.\n\nThe lungs have spongy tissue unlike the sacs of other saurians. This allows for greater rates of gas exchange and allows a faster metabolic rate and higher activity levels. Like all varanids, they have subpleurodont teeth, meaning the teeth are fused to the inside of the jaw bones.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):50</ref> The teeth are placed one behind another, and there are replacement teeth behind and between each functional tooth (polyphyodont). The maxillary and dentary teeth are laterally compressed, sometimes with a slightly serrate cutting edge, while the premaxillary teeth are conical. There are 78 premaxillary teeth, 10 maxillary and 13 dentary teeth. Replacement teeth move forward and about four replacements happens each year for a tooth.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):51</ref> Their mandibular glands produce secretions at the base of the teeth, and although some varanids have been shown to have a venom, no toxicity has been reported in the Bengal monitor.<ref name=\"Auffenberg 1994:58\">Auffenberg (1994):58</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Bengal monitor at Anawilundawa Bird Sanctuary - (A Mischievous Grin).jpg|thumb|showing forked tongue]]\nThe species ranges from Iran to Java, among the most widely distributed of varanid lizards. It is found in river valleys in eastern [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Burma]]. The closely related species ''Varanus nebulosus'', the clouded monitor, occurs in southern [[Burma]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sumatra]], [[Java]] and the [[Sunda Islands]]. They have not been confirmed on Sumatra, and have been found to be absent from the [[Andaman Islands]].<ref>Auffenberg (1994):86</ref>\n\nThe species is distributed mainly in the lower elevations, and is found both in dry semiarid desert habitats to moist forest.

The main breeding season is June to September, but males begin to show combat behaviour by April. Females dig a nest hole in level ground or a vertical bank and lay the eggs inside, filling it up and using their snouts to compact the soil. The females often dig false nests nearby and shovel soil around the area. They sometimes make use of a termite mound to nest. A single clutch of about 20 eggs are laid. The eggs hatch in 168 to nearly as long as 254 days.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):230-247</ref> About 40-80% of the eggs may hatch.\n=== Locomotion ===\nThey are capable of rapid movement on the ground. Small individuals may climb trees to escape, but larger ones prefer to escape on the ground. They can climb well. On the ground, they sometimes stand on the hind legs to get a better view or when males fight other males.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):183</ref> They can also swim well and can stay submerged for at least 17 minutes.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):185</ref> They can use both trees and bushes for shelter.<ref name=\"Ghimire and Phuyal 2013\"/>\n\n=== Food ===\nBengal monitors tend to remain active the whole day. Large adults may ascend vertical tree trunks, where they sometimes stalk and capture roosting bats. Prey mostly consists of beetles, grubs, orthopterans, scorpions, snails, ants and other invertebrates. Vertebrate prey are comparatively rarely consumed, and includes frogs, fish, lizards, snakes and rodents. Bengal monitors are also scavengers, and sometimes feed on dead animals.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):267</ref> In areas where livestock are common, they often seek out dung to forage for beetles and other insects.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):349</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rahman K.

This large lizard is mainly [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], and its length can range from about 61 to 175&nbsp;cm from the tip of the snout to the end of the tail. Young monitors may be more [[arboreal]], but adults mainly hunt on the ground, [[prey]]ing mainly on [[arthropods]], but also taking small terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s, ground [[bird]]s, [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] and [[fish]]. Although large monitors have few [[predator]]s apart from humans who hunt them for meat, younger individuals are hunted by many predators.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Bengal Monitor (Varanus bengalensis) Juvenile. (28230373818).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|juveniles are patterned and more colourful]]\nThe Bengal monitor can reach 175&nbsp;cm with a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of 75&nbsp;cm and a tail of 100&nbsp;cm. Males are generally larger than females. Heavy individuals may weigh nearly 7.2&nbsp;kg.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):14-15</ref> The populations of monitors in India and Sri Lanka differ in the scalation from those of Myanmar; these were once considered subspecies of the Bengal monitor, but now considered two species within the ''V. bengalensis'' species complex. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=B\u00d6HME|first=WOLFGANG|date=2003-01-01|title=Checklist of the living lizards of the world (family Varanidae)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237517031_Checklist_of_the_living_lizards_of_the_world_family_Varanidae|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology - BMC EVOL BIOL|volume=341}}</ref> What was once the nominate subspecies, ''V. bengalensis'', is found west of Myanmar, while ''[[Clouded monitor|V. nebulosus]]'' is found to the east. ''V. nebulosus'' can be differentiated by the presence of a series of enlarged scales in the supraocular region. The number of ventral scales varies, decreasing from 108 in the west to 75 in the east (Java).<ref>Auffenberg (1994):24</ref>\n[[File:Bengal Monitor at Nagarahole.jpg|left|thumb|adult]]\nYoung monitor lizards are more colourful than adults. Young have a series of dark crossbars on the neck, throat and back. The belly is white, banded with dark crossbars and are spotted with grey or yellow (particularly in the eastern part of the range). On the dorsal surface of young monitors, there are a series of yellow spots with dark transverse bars connecting them. As they mature, the ground colour becomes light brown or grey, and dark spots give them a speckled appearance. Hatchlings of ''V. nebulosus'' by comparison tend to have a series of backward-pointing, V-shaped bands on their necks.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):39</ref>\n\nBengal monitors have external nostril openings (nares) that is slit-like and oriented near horizontal, and positions between the eye and the tip of the snout. The nares can be closed at will, especially to keep away debris or water.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):22</ref> The scales of the skin are rougher in patches and on the sides, they have minute pits, especially well distributed in males.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):36</ref> These scales with micropores have glandular structures in the underlying dermal tissue and produce a secretion which may be a pheromone-like substance. Like other varanids, Bengal monitors have a forked tongue that is protruded in the manner of snakes. The function is mainly sensory, and is not very involved in the transport of food down the throat. Bengal monitors have fat deposits in the tail and body that serve them in conditions when prey are not easily available.\n\nThe lungs have spongy tissue unlike the sacs of other saurians. This allows for greater rates of gas exchange and allows a faster metabolic rate and higher activity levels. Like all varanids, they have subpleurodont teeth, meaning the teeth are fused to the inside of the jaw bones.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):50</ref> The teeth are placed one behind another, and there are replacement teeth behind and between each functional tooth (polyphyodont). The maxillary and dentary teeth are laterally compressed, sometimes with a slightly serrate cutting edge, while the premaxillary teeth are conical. There are 78 premaxillary teeth, 10 maxillary and 13 dentary teeth. Replacement teeth move forward and about four replacements happens each year for a tooth.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):51</ref> Their mandibular glands produce secretions at the base of the teeth, and although some varanids have been shown to have a venom, no toxicity has been reported in the Bengal monitor.<ref name=\"Auffenberg 1994:58\">Auffenberg (1994):58</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Bengal monitor at Anawilundawa Bird Sanctuary - (A Mischievous Grin).jpg|thumb|showing forked tongue]]\nThe species ranges from Iran to Java, among the most widely distributed of varanid lizards. It is found in river valleys in eastern [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Burma]]. The closely related species ''Varanus nebulosus'', the clouded monitor, occurs in southern [[Burma]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sumatra]], [[Java]] and the [[Sunda Islands]]. They have not been confirmed on Sumatra, and have been found to be absent from the [[Andaman Islands]].<ref>Auffenberg (1994):86</ref>\n\nThe species is distributed mainly in the lower elevations, and is found both in dry semiarid desert habitats to moist forest. They are often found in agricultural areas, and are mainly found below 1500m altitude.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):103-118</ref> It often occurs in agricultural areas. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/en|title=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Varanus bengalensis|date=2009-06-30|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|doi=10.2305/iucn.uk.2010-4.rlts.t164579a5909661.en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology and behaviour ==\n[[File:Monitor lizard image.jpg|thumb|eating egg]]\nBengal monitors are usually solitary and usually found on the ground, although the young are often seen on trees. ''V. nebulosus'' has a greater propensity for tree climbing. The two sympatric species Bengal and [[yellow monitor]] partially separated their habitat as Bengal monitor prefers Forest over agricultural areas.<ref name=\"herpconbio.org\">Ghimire, H. R., & Shah, K. B. (2014). Status and habitat ecology of the Yellow Monitor, Varanus flavescens, in the Southeastern part of Kanchanpur District, Nepal. Herpetological Conservation and Biology, 9(2), 387-393. http://www.herpconbio.org/Volume_9/Issue_2/Ghimire_Shah_2014.pdf</ref> Bengal monitors shelter in burrows they dig or crevices in rocks and buildings, whilst clouded monitors prefer tree hollows. Both races will make use of abandoned termite mounds. Bengal monitors, like other varanids, show true sleep at night and are diurnal, becoming active around 6 AM and bask in the morning sun.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):138-145</ref> During winter, in the colder parts of their distribution range, they may take shelter and go through a period of reduced metabolic activity.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):147</ref> They are not territorial, and may change their range seasonally in response to food availability.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):175</ref>\n\nThey are usually shy and avoid humans. They have keen eyesight and can detect human movement nearly 250 m away. When caught, a few individuals may bite, but rarely do so.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):182</ref>\n\nAlthough they are found on agricultural land, they prefer forests with large trees.<ref name=\"herpconbio.org\"/> Generally, high ground cover with large trees are favorable areas.<ref name=\"Ghimire and Phuyal 2013\">{{cite journal |author=Ghimire, H.

A number of ectoparasites and endoparasites are recorded.\n\n=== Breeding ===\nFemales may be able to retain sperm, and females held in confinement have been able to lay fertile eggs.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):221</ref> Some species of monitor lizards such as ''Varanus niloticus'' have additionally demonstrated to be capable of [[parthenogenesis]]. The main breeding season is June to September, but males begin to show combat behaviour by April. Females dig a nest hole in level ground or a vertical bank and lay the eggs inside, filling it up and using their snouts to compact the soil. The females often dig false nests nearby and shovel soil around the area. They sometimes make use of a termite mound to nest. A single clutch of about 20 eggs are laid. The eggs hatch in 168 to nearly as long as 254 days.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):230-247</ref> About 40-80% of the eggs may hatch.\n=== Locomotion ===\nThey are capable of rapid movement on the ground. Small individuals may climb trees to escape, but larger ones prefer to escape on the ground. They can climb well. On the ground, they sometimes stand on the hind legs to get a better view or when males fight other males.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):183</ref> They can also swim well and can stay submerged for at least 17 minutes.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):185</ref> They can use both trees and bushes for shelter.<ref name=\"Ghimire and Phuyal 2013\"/>\n\n=== Food ===\nBengal monitors tend to remain active the whole day. Large adults may ascend vertical tree trunks, where they sometimes stalk and capture roosting bats. Prey mostly consists of beetles, grubs, orthopterans, scorpions, snails, ants and other invertebrates. Vertebrate prey are comparatively rarely consumed, and includes frogs, fish, lizards, snakes and rodents. Bengal monitors are also scavengers, and sometimes feed on dead animals.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):267</ref> In areas where livestock are common, they often seek out dung to forage for beetles and other insects.<ref>Auffenberg (1994):349</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rahman K.

As a subdivision of the [[National Premier Leagues|nationwide NPL]], the league is the highest level within the [[Football Victoria#Soccer pyramid in Victoria|Victorian soccer league system]], serving jointly as the second tier within the overall [[Australian soccer league system|Australian pyramid]].\n\nAdministered by [[Football Victoria]], NPL Victoria is the latest iteration of first division competitions in the state. Historically known as the '''Victorian State League''' and later as the '''Victorian Premier League''', the league was first founded in 1908. It adopted its current branding in 2014, following [[Football Federation Australia]]'s 2012 National Competition Review. \n\nNPL Victoria is contested by 14 clubs. Running from February to September each year, the league sees teams play 26 regular season fixtures, once at home and once away against each other club. The first-placed team at the conclusion of the regular season is termed the \"premier\". The top six-placed clubs then play a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] [[playoffs|finals series]], with the winner becoming the \"champion\". The bottom-placed teams operate a system of promotion and relegation with the division below, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. \n\nThe league premier qualifies as Victoria's representative in the [[National Premier Leagues#Competition format##NPL Finals Series|national finals series]], whilst the champion plays against the [[Dockerty Cup]] winner in the [[FV Community Shield]].\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Victorian Premier League 2010.png|thumb|150px|Victorian Premier League logo.]] -->\nThe league commenced in 1909 with [[Carlton United FC|Carlton United]] being the first champions. It has run continuously except for a three season postponement from 1916 to 1918 owing to World War I. After 1945 the league, like fellow state competitions around the country, received a massive boost in numbers and quality with the post-war influx of European migrants, whose dominance was established so effectively that no club which had won the title before 1952, [[Brunswick Juventus|Juventus]]' first title, has won one since.\n\nJuventus would go on to dominate the league in the 1950s, winning six titles, including five in a row from 1952 to 1956. In 1958, after the Victorian Amateur Soccer Federation was formed, the league became known as the Victorian State League. From 1962 until 1976 the league was largely dominated by [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne Hellas]] and [[Footscray JUST]], which won 11 titles between them.\n\nWith creation of the [[National Soccer League]] (NSL) in 1977, the league gradually lost most of its stronger clubs, a trend that reached its peak between 1984 and 1986, when the NSL used a split conference system. After 1987, however, the league slowly started regaining clubs, firstly those discarded when the conference system experiment was abandoned and later when clubs became permanently relegated by the NSL to their respective state leagues. The dominant side during the years from 1977 to 2004 was [[Green Gully Cavaliers|Green Gully]], who won six titles during this period, despite also missing the years 1984\u20131986 from being in the NSL.\n\nIn 1991 the league rebranded again to become the Victorian Premier League and the first finals to determine the champions were staged in 1992, won by the newly promoted [[North Geelong Warriors|North Geelong]]. Following the demise of the NSL in 2004, the remaining two Victorian NSL teams [[Melbourne Knights]] and [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] were granted permission to play in the VPL season of 2005. The league received a major boost at the start of the 2005 season when [[Vodafone]] became major naming rights sponsors, with the competition being renamed the Vodafone Cup. The 2005 season initially saw crowds attending in record numbers to witness the return of old derbies such as that between South Melbourne and [[Heidelberg United]], but with the formation of the A-League filling the void of a national domestic league, 2006 saw a sharp decline in attendances.\n\nThe end of the 2006 season also witnessed a controversial finish to the relegation battle. With three teams finishing on 30 points, [[Sunshine George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]] were relegated on goal difference. However, a post-season appeal to the tribunal on the grounds that [[Bulleen Royals|Essendon Royals]] had fielded a suspended player (Ilcho Mladenovski in round 24) saw the Royals deducted a point and relegated. Ultimately, both clubs reprised their position in the following season's competition with the inclusion of the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] evening out the numbers to 16, and as the first part of reforms to the competition set to be brought about in 2008.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Sport experiment was largely derided by the local clubs, and after their removal from the competition in 2008, the league reverted to 12 teams and a Top 5 Finals-Series in 2009. However, the concept of a youth development squad was reintroduced in 2010 with the National Training Centre team playing in midweek fixtures throughout the season but not for competition points. In 2011 the team, mostly comprising players from the [[Melbourne Victory]] youth squad, was renamed Victorian Training Centre Football and was eligible to score competition points for its matches but ineligible to qualify for the finals series or be relegated.\n\nOn 15 September 2013, Victoria Police arrested up to ten people, including [[Southern Stars FC]] players David Obaze, Nicholas McKoy and Joe Woolley as well as the coach, Zaya Younan, for allegations of match fixing. They are expected to be charged with corrupting the outcome of betting.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/victorian-detectives-bust-soccer-matchfixing-syndicate-20130915-2tsh5.html ''The Age'' newspaper]</ref>\n\nIn early 2013, it was announced that Victoria would join the [[National Premier Leagues]], with the Victorian Premier League expected to be rebranded for the 2014 season.<ref name=\"australian-gallop-fa-cup\">{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/football/gallop-aims-for-aussie-fa-cup/story-fn63e0vj-1226577434849 | title=Gallop aims for Aussie FA Cup | work=The Australian | date=14 February 2013 | agency=Australian Associated Press | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"442-seconddivision\">{{cite news | url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/252498,second-division-by-2022.aspx | title=Second Division 'By 2022'? | work=Australian FourFourTwo | date=3 October 2012 | agency=Sportal Australia | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Although Football Federation Victoria's initial proposal was halted with the announcement of a deferral in November 2013 after several clubs objected to the process for selecting team.

The season is staged during the Australian winter, running from February to September. The league combines aspects of both the traditional European-style [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] and Australian-style [[playoffs|finals series]] within its competition format.  \n===Regular season===\nThe regular season consists of a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]]. Each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 26 matches. Teams receive [[three points for a win]], one point for a draw and no points for a loss. The clubs are ranked first based on the number of points acquired during the season. If two teams have an equal number of points, they are separated firstly by [[goal difference]] and then the number of goals scored, calculated across all matches. The Rules of Competition provide head-to-head aggregate and head-to-head [[away goals rule|away goals]] as further tiebreakers if necessary.<ref>https://www.footballvictoria.com.au/sites/ffv/files/2019-02/2019%20Rules%20of%20Competitions%20Mens%20%20Boys%20final.pdf</ref> The team ranked first at the end of the regular season is termed the premiers, and becomes Victoria's entry for the [[National Premier Leagues|national NPL finals]]. \n===Finals series===\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the six highest-ranked clubs qualify for the (Victorian) finals series. The finals take place over three weeks, with teams entering the series based on their respective finishes in the regular season. The teams ranked 3\u20136 enter at the elimination finals stage. The third-ranked team plays the sixth-ranked team, whilst the fourth-ranked team plays the fifth-ranked one. The two winners of the elimination finals meet the teams ranked 1 and 2 in the semi-finals. The premier in the regular season plays the lower-ranked qualifier from the elimination finals, whilst the runner-up plays the higher-ranked qualifier. The finals conclude with the [[grand final]], played between the two winners of the semi-finals. The winner of the grand final is crowned the champions. As all finals matches require a winner, they are all [[single-elimination tournament|knock-out fixtures]]. If a draw occurs at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] are played. A [[penalty shoot-out]] is played if the teams are still drawn.\n\n===Promotion and relegation===\nNPL Victoria also operates a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the division immediately below it, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. The 13th and 14th-ranked clubs are automatically relegated. From NPL 2, the winners of each of the conferences, East and West, are automatically promoted to replaced the two lowest-ranked NPL clubs. The 12th-ranked NPL club also participates in a single-leg promotion/relegation play-off against an NPL 2 team, with the winner competing in the following year's NPL. The NPL 2 representative in the promotion/relegation play-off is determined by an earlier play-off between the runners-up of the two respective conferences.\n\n==Current clubs==\nThe following clubs are contesting the 2020 NPL Victoria season:\n\n[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]] and [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]] were promoted from [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]] in 2019 as the champions of the East and West conferences, respectively, while [[Pascoe Vale FC|Pascoe Vale]] and [[Kingston City FC|Kingston City]] were relegated as the two last-placed finishers. [[Dandenong Thunder SC|Dandenong Thunder]] avoided relegation by winning the promotion/relegation play-off against [[FC Bulleen Lions|Bulleen Lions]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne |caption=Locations of 2020 NPL Victoria clubs within metropolitan Melbourne\n| width = 380\n| places =\n {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Avondale FC|Avondale]] \n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.7626|S|144.8583|E}} }}\n {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Altona Magic SC|Altona]] \n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = top\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|50|48|S|144|51|25|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Bentleigh Greens|Bentleigh]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|58|7|S|145|5|27|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Green Gully SC|Green Gully]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = left\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|43|27|S|144|49|8|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Heidelberg United FC|Heidelberg]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|44|23|S|145|2|3|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Hume City FC|Hume]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = top\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|39|55|S|144|54|58|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Melbourne Knights FC|Knights]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = left\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|45|44|S|144|50|43|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Oakleigh Cannons FC|Oakleigh]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|54|22|S|145|5|55|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.8585318|S|145.0983669|E}} }} \n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.7330618|S|144.8119635|E}}  }} \n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Port Melbourne SC|Port Melbourne]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37|49|59.92|S|144|55|44.17|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Dandenong Thunder SC|Dandenong Thunder]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|38.0023|S|145.2092|E}} }}\n{{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Dandenong City SC|Dandenong City]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37.9599|S|145.2377|E}} }}\n{{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37|50|25|S|144|57|54|E}} }}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

As a subdivision of the [[National Premier Leagues|nationwide NPL]], the league is the highest level within the [[Football Victoria#Soccer pyramid in Victoria|Victorian soccer league system]], serving jointly as the second tier within the overall [[Australian soccer league system|Australian pyramid]].\n\nAdministered by [[Football Victoria]], NPL Victoria is the latest iteration of first division competitions in the state. Historically known as the '''Victorian State League''' and later as the '''Victorian Premier League''', the league was first founded in 1908. It adopted its current branding in 2014, following [[Football Federation Australia]]'s 2012 National Competition Review. \n\nNPL Victoria is contested by 14 clubs. Running from February to September each year, the league sees teams play 26 regular season fixtures, once at home and once away against each other club. The first-placed team at the conclusion of the regular season is termed the \"premier\". The top six-placed clubs then play a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] [[playoffs|finals series]], with the winner becoming the \"champion\". The bottom-placed teams operate a system of promotion and relegation with the division below, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. \n\nThe league premier qualifies as Victoria's representative in the [[National Premier Leagues#Competition format##NPL Finals Series|national finals series]], whilst the champion plays against the [[Dockerty Cup]] winner in the [[FV Community Shield]].\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Victorian Premier League 2010.png|thumb|150px|Victorian Premier League logo.]] -->\nThe league commenced in 1909 with [[Carlton United FC|Carlton United]] being the first champions. It has run continuously except for a three season postponement from 1916 to 1918 owing to World War I. After 1945 the league, like fellow state competitions around the country, received a massive boost in numbers and quality with the post-war influx of European migrants, whose dominance was established so effectively that no club which had won the title before 1952, [[Brunswick Juventus|Juventus]]' first title, has won one since.\n\nJuventus would go on to dominate the league in the 1950s, winning six titles, including five in a row from 1952 to 1956. In 1958, after the Victorian Amateur Soccer Federation was formed, the league became known as the Victorian State League. From 1962 until 1976 the league was largely dominated by [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne Hellas]] and [[Footscray JUST]], which won 11 titles between them.\n\nWith creation of the [[National Soccer League]] (NSL) in 1977, the league gradually lost most of its stronger clubs, a trend that reached its peak between 1984 and 1986, when the NSL used a split conference system. After 1987, however, the league slowly started regaining clubs, firstly those discarded when the conference system experiment was abandoned and later when clubs became permanently relegated by the NSL to their respective state leagues. The dominant side during the years from 1977 to 2004 was [[Green Gully Cavaliers|Green Gully]], who won six titles during this period, despite also missing the years 1984\u20131986 from being in the NSL.\n\nIn 1991 the league rebranded again to become the Victorian Premier League and the first finals to determine the champions were staged in 1992, won by the newly promoted [[North Geelong Warriors|North Geelong]]. Following the demise of the NSL in 2004, the remaining two Victorian NSL teams [[Melbourne Knights]] and [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] were granted permission to play in the VPL season of 2005. The league received a major boost at the start of the 2005 season when [[Vodafone]] became major naming rights sponsors, with the competition being renamed the Vodafone Cup. The 2005 season initially saw crowds attending in record numbers to witness the return of old derbies such as that between South Melbourne and [[Heidelberg United]], but with the formation of the A-League filling the void of a national domestic league, 2006 saw a sharp decline in attendances.\n\nThe end of the 2006 season also witnessed a controversial finish to the relegation battle. With three teams finishing on 30 points, [[Sunshine George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]] were relegated on goal difference. However, a post-season appeal to the tribunal on the grounds that [[Bulleen Royals|Essendon Royals]] had fielded a suspended player (Ilcho Mladenovski in round 24) saw the Royals deducted a point and relegated. Ultimately, both clubs reprised their position in the following season's competition with the inclusion of the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] evening out the numbers to 16, and as the first part of reforms to the competition set to be brought about in 2008.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Sport experiment was largely derided by the local clubs, and after their removal from the competition in 2008, the league reverted to 12 teams and a Top 5 Finals-Series in 2009. However, the concept of a youth development squad was reintroduced in 2010 with the National Training Centre team playing in midweek fixtures throughout the season but not for competition points. In 2011 the team, mostly comprising players from the [[Melbourne Victory]] youth squad, was renamed Victorian Training Centre Football and was eligible to score competition points for its matches but ineligible to qualify for the finals series or be relegated.\n\nOn 15 September 2013, Victoria Police arrested up to ten people, including [[Southern Stars FC]] players David Obaze, Nicholas McKoy and Joe Woolley as well as the coach, Zaya Younan, for allegations of match fixing. They are expected to be charged with corrupting the outcome of betting.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/victorian-detectives-bust-soccer-matchfixing-syndicate-20130915-2tsh5.html ''The Age'' newspaper]</ref>\n\nIn early 2013, it was announced that Victoria would join the [[National Premier Leagues]], with the Victorian Premier League expected to be rebranded for the 2014 season.<ref name=\"australian-gallop-fa-cup\">{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/football/gallop-aims-for-aussie-fa-cup/story-fn63e0vj-1226577434849 | title=Gallop aims for Aussie FA Cup | work=The Australian | date=14 February 2013 | agency=Australian Associated Press | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"442-seconddivision\">{{cite news | url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/252498,second-division-by-2022.aspx | title=Second Division 'By 2022'? | work=Australian FourFourTwo | date=3 October 2012 | agency=Sportal Australia | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Although Football Federation Victoria's initial proposal was halted with the announcement of a deferral in November 2013 after several clubs objected to the process for selecting team.

The season is staged during the Australian winter, running from February to September. The league combines aspects of both the traditional European-style [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] and Australian-style [[playoffs|finals series]] within its competition format.  \n===Regular season===\nThe regular season consists of a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]]. Each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 26 matches. Teams receive [[three points for a win]], one point for a draw and no points for a loss. The clubs are ranked first based on the number of points acquired during the season. If two teams have an equal number of points, they are separated firstly by [[goal difference]] and then the number of goals scored, calculated across all matches. The Rules of Competition provide head-to-head aggregate and head-to-head [[away goals rule|away goals]] as further tiebreakers if necessary.<ref>https://www.footballvictoria.com.au/sites/ffv/files/2019-02/2019%20Rules%20of%20Competitions%20Mens%20%20Boys%20final.pdf</ref> The team ranked first at the end of the regular season is termed the premiers, and becomes Victoria's entry for the [[National Premier Leagues|national NPL finals]]. \n===Finals series===\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the six highest-ranked clubs qualify for the (Victorian) finals series. The finals take place over three weeks, with teams entering the series based on their respective finishes in the regular season. The teams ranked 3\u20136 enter at the elimination finals stage. The third-ranked team plays the sixth-ranked team, whilst the fourth-ranked team plays the fifth-ranked one. The two winners of the elimination finals meet the teams ranked 1 and 2 in the semi-finals. The premier in the regular season plays the lower-ranked qualifier from the elimination finals, whilst the runner-up plays the higher-ranked qualifier. The finals conclude with the [[grand final]], played between the two winners of the semi-finals. The winner of the grand final is crowned the champions. As all finals matches require a winner, they are all [[single-elimination tournament|knock-out fixtures]]. If a draw occurs at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] are played. A [[penalty shoot-out]] is played if the teams are still drawn.\n\n===Promotion and relegation===\nNPL Victoria also operates a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the division immediately below it, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. The 13th and 14th-ranked clubs are automatically relegated. From NPL 2, the winners of each of the conferences, East and West, are automatically promoted to replaced the two lowest-ranked NPL clubs. The 12th-ranked NPL club also participates in a single-leg promotion/relegation play-off against an NPL 2 team, with the winner competing in the following year's NPL. The NPL 2 representative in the promotion/relegation play-off is determined by an earlier play-off between the runners-up of the two respective conferences.\n\n==Current clubs==\nThe following clubs are contesting the 2020 NPL Victoria season:\n\n[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]] and [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]] were promoted from [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]] in 2019 as the champions of the East and West conferences, respectively, while [[Pascoe Vale FC|Pascoe Vale]] and [[Kingston City FC|Kingston City]] were relegated as the two last-placed finishers.

The Office of Education was created to meet the need to gather statistical information on the fast-growing educational institutions of the United States, along with histories and descriptive articles, pamphlets, reports and books, often in coordination with state universities.  Reformers (especially [[Republican Party (United States)|Radical Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Progressive and liberal Democrats]])  hoped that the Office would become a powerful federal agency, but were frustrated at every turn by Congress, which did not or want to trespass on the right of the states and local jurisdictions in the cities, towns and counties to control educational policy - the time of \"states' rights\" was still in full sway, despite the recent [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and it would take several other domestic and foreign crises in the coming decades to bring a sense of a more centralized and national policy to the forefront to make up for increasingly embarrassing shortfalls in comparison between America and overseas educational programs, especially in [[Europe]].\n\nThe Bureau, and later Office, of Education was a unit of the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]], therefore it was under the aegis of the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]].  It had no power to control the actions of educational institutions.  At times during its first decades of its existence, attempts were made to change its name.  These names (Board, Department, Office, and Bureau) were considered.  In 1873, a bill (H. R. 3782) was introduced which would change its name to the Bureau of Education and Statistics.\n\nThe [[United States Commissioner of Education|Commissioner of Education]] was required to prepare a Report annually, which was printed and given to members of Congress ([[United States Senator|U.S. Senators]] and [[United States Representative|Representatives]]), other governmental officials and certain other persons.  In 1875, 20,000 copies of the Report for 1874 were printed; 5,000 copies for the use of members of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], 10,000 copies for the use of members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and 5,000 copies for the use of the Commissioner of Education and their Office.\n\nThe Office gathered information on diverse educational facilities such as those being built (i.e. the famous [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] at [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]] in the east and near western [[Indian reservations|reservations]]) to bring an education and vocational/agricultural training to [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in which there had already been historically established a direct and prominent national Federal role and obligation towards the treatment and education of Indians as well as all of the facilities in all of the other places.\n\n==Dissolution and legacy==\nIn 1972, Public Law 92-318 provided the repeal of the law which had created the Office of Education.  The repeal took effect on July 1, 1972.\n\nThe Office of Education had a unifying influence on the different educational institutions of the [[United States]], caused by supplying the leaders of the institutions with information that enabled them to know of the practices of other institutions.
