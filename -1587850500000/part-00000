Russia]]'', the court ruled that Russia breached three articles of the European Convention, including the right to freedom of assembly (Article 11), the right to effective legal remedy (Article 13) and the ban on discrimination (Article 14). The court decided that Russia has to pay to the applicant almost 30,000 euros in compensation. The case marked the first ever international defeat of Russian Government on the issue of gay rights.\n\nAs of January 2011, Nikolay Alexeyev had one complaint pending at the [[UN Human Rights Committee]] concerning the ban of a picket in front of the Iranian Embassy on 19 July 2008 in Moscow. The action was a symbolic protest asking for Iran authorities to stop killing homosexual people. In his complaint Nikolay Alexeyev suggested that by banning the event Russian authorities breached Article 21 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] which guarantees the right to [[freedom of assembly]] to everyone. The case was initiated at the UN on 26 March 2009. It is the first time that a case concerning an [[LGBT]] topic is sent against Russia to this institution. In April 2009 the UN Human Rights Committee gave Russian authorities 6 months to express their position on the case which was done.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Gay Activists Appeal Ban on Iranian Embassy Picket to the UN Human Rights Committee|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/09/Mar/2602.htm|accessdate=20 July 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107023022/http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk//Archive/09/Mar/2602.htm|archivedate=7 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=UN Human Rights Committee Gives Russia 6 Months to Justify Gay Picket Ban in Moscow|url=http://www.gayrussia.ru/en/support/detail.php?ID=13424|date=|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2009}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As of November 2010, the Committee has yet to take a decision on the admissibility and merits of the case.\n\n===Politics===\nNikolay Alexeyev has never been a member of any political parties or movements, trying not to associate LGBT movement with any political forces in Russia.

While tapping, they recite specific phrases that target an emotional component of a physical symptom. &nbsp;\n\nAccording to the EFT manual, the procedure consists of the participant rating the emotional intensity of their reaction on a [[Subjective Units of Distress Scale]] (SUDS) (a [[Likert scale]] for subjective measures of distress, calibrated 0-10) then repeating an orienting [[Affirmations (New Age)|affirmation]] while rubbing or tapping specific points on the body.

Credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], it was written by [[John Lennon]],{{sfn|Turner Classic Movies|2009}} with some collaboration from [[Paul McCartney]]. It was released on the [[A Hard Day's Night (album)|film soundtrack of the same name]] in 1964. It was also released in the UK as a single, with \"[[Things We Said Today]]\" as its [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].\n\nThe song featured prominently on the [[A Hard Day's Night (album)|soundtrack]] to the Beatles' first [[feature film]], ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', and was on their album of the same name. The song topped the charts in both the United Kingdom and United States when it was released as a single. The American and British singles of \"A Hard Day's Night\" as well as both the American and British albums of the same title all held the top position in their respective charts for a couple of weeks in August 1964, the first time any artist had accomplished this feat.{{sfn|White|2008}}\n\n==Title==\nThe song's title originated from something said by [[Ringo Starr]], the Beatles' drummer. Starr described it this way in an interview with [[disc jockey]] [[Dave Hull]] in 1964: \"We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day \u2026' and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, '\u2026 night!' So we came to 'A Hard Day's Night.'\"{{sfn|Badman|p = 93}}\n\nStarr's statement was the inspiration for the title of the film, which in turn inspired the composition of the song. According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine: \"I was going home in the car and [[Richard Lester|Dick Lester]] [director of the movie] suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in ''[[In His Own Write]]'' [a book Lennon was writing then], but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those [[malapropism]]s. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny \u2026 just said it. So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|pp = 174\u2013175}}\n\nIn a 1994 interview for ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, basically stating that it was the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come up with the idea of using Starr's verbal misstep: \"The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session \u2026 and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical \u2026 they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'\"{{sfn|Miles|1997|p = 164}}\n\nIn 1996, yet another version of events cropped up. In an [[Associated Press]] report, the producer of the film ''A Hard Day's Night'', Walter Shenson, stated that Lennon described to Shenson some of Starr's funnier gaffes, including \"a hard day's night\", whereupon Shenson immediately decided that that was going to be the title of the movie (replacing other alternatives, including ''Beatlemania'').{{sfn|Harry|2000|p = 486}} Shenson then told Lennon that he needed a theme song for the film.{{sfn|Campbell|1996}}\n\n==Composition==\nLennon dashed off the song in one night, and brought it in for comments the following morning.  As he described in his 1980 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, \"the next morning I brought in the song \u2026 'cuz there was a little competition between Paul and I as to who got the A-side \u2013 who got the hits. If you notice, in the early days the majority of singles, in the movies and everything, were mine \u2026 in the early period I'm dominating the group \u2026 The reason Paul sang on 'A Hard Day's Night' (in the bridge) is because I couldn't reach the notes.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|pp = 174\u2013175}} However, McCartney and others{{who|date=April 2020}} remember McCartney collaborating with Lennon.{{sfn|Compton|2017|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nOn 16 April 1964, the Beatles gathered at Studio 2 of the [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] and recorded \"A Hard Day's Night\". It took them less than three hours to polish the song for its final release, eventually selecting the ninth take as the one to be released.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p = 43}}  ''[[Evening Standard]]'' journalist [[Maureen Cleave]] described a memorable taxi ride the morning the song was recorded:\n\n{{quote|One day I picked John up in a taxi and took him to Abbey Road for a recording session. The tune to the song 'A Hard Day's Night' was in his head, the words scrawled on a [[birthday card]] from a fan to his little son Julian: 'When I get home to you,' it said, 'I find my tiredness is through \u2026' Rather a feeble line about tiredness, I said. 'OK,' he said cheerfully and, borrowing my pen, instantly changed it to the slightly suggestive: 'When I get home to you/I find the things that you do/Will make me feel all right.' The other Beatles were there in the studio and, of course, the wonderful George Martin. John sort of hummed the tune to the others \u2013 they had no copies of the words or anything else. Three hours later I was none the wiser about how they\u2019d done it but the record was made \u2013 and you can see the birthday card in the [[British Library]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Hard Day's Night|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/albums/a-hard-days-night/|publisher=The Beatles Bible|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the Associated Press report, Shenson described his recollection of what happened. At 8:30 in the morning, \"There were John and Paul with guitars at the ready and all the lyrics scribbled on matchbook covers.

The strident guitar chord was the perfect launch,\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p = 43}} having what [[Ian MacDonald]] called \"a significance in Beatles lore matched only by the concluding E [[major chord|major]] of \"[[A Day in the Life]]\", the two opening and closing the group's middle period of peak creativity\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p = 115}}\n\n[[musical analysis|Analysis]] of the chord has been debated,{{sfn|Hook|2005}} it having been described as G7add9[[eleventh chord#Fourth|sus4]],{{sfn|Glynn|2004|pp = 33, 68}} G7[[suspended chord|sus4]],{{sfn|Rooksby|2004|p = 61}}{{sfn|Leonard|2003|p = 126}} or G11sus4{{sfn|Jackson|2005|p = 112}} and others below.\n\nPart of the [[chord (music)|chord]] is an F[[ninth chord#Second|add9]] as confirmed by Harrison during an online chat on 15 February 2001:{{sfn|Pedler|2003|pp = 478\u2013479}}\n\n{{quote|Q: Mr Harrison, what is the opening chord you used for \"A Hard Day's Night\"?<br>A: It is F with a G on top, but you'll have to ask Paul about the [[bass note]] to get the proper story.}}\n\nAccording to [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] the opening chord has an introductory [[dominant (music)|dominant]] function because McCartney plays D in the bass: Harrison and Martin play F A C G, over the bass D, on [[twelve-string guitar]] and piano respectively, giving the chord a mixture-coloured neighbour, F; two diatonic neighbours, A and C; plus an [[nonchord tone#Unaccented|anticipation]] of the tonic, G \u2013 the major [[subtonic]] as played on guitar being a [[Borrowed chord#Borrowed chords|borrowed chord]] commonly used by the Beatles, first in \"[[P.S. I Love You (The Beatles song)|P.S. I Love You]]\" (see [[mode mixture]]), and later in \"[[Every Little Thing (Beatles song)|Every Little Thing]]\", \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\" and \"[[Got to Get You into My Life]]\" (in the latter two against a tonic [[pedal point|pedal]]).{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp = 236\u2013237}}\n\n[[Alan W. Pollack]] also interprets the chord as a surrogate dominant, the G being an [[nonchord tone#Unaccented|anticipation]] that resolves on the G major chord that opens the verse. He suggests it is a mixture of D minor, F major, and G major (missing the B).{{sfn|Pollack}} Tony Bacon calls it a Dm7sus4 (D F G A C),{{sfn|Bacon|2000|p = 5}} which is the [[minor seventh chord]] (plus the fourth, G) (for more information regarding chord functions see [[diatonic function]]).\n\nEverett points out that the chord relates to the Beatles' interest in [[pandiatonic]] [[harmony]].{{sfn|Everett|2001|p = 109}}\n\nDominic Pedler has also provided an interpretation of the chord,{{sfn|Pedler|2003|pp = 511\u201312}} with the Beatles and George Martin playing the following:\n*'''George Harrison:''' Fadd9 in 1st position on Rickenbacker 360/12 12-string electric guitar\n*'''John Lennon:''' Fadd9 in 1st position on a Gibson J-160E 6-string acoustic guitar\n*'''Paul McCartney:''' high D played on the D-string, 12th fret on Hofner 500/1 electric bass\n*'''George Martin:''' D2-G2-D3 played on a Steinway Grand Piano\n*'''Ringo Starr:''' subtle snare drum and ride cymbal\n\nThis gives the notes:\n'''G-B-D-F-A-C''' (the B is a harmonic). One of the interesting things about this chord (as described by Pedler) is how McCartney's high bass note reverberates inside the soundbox of Lennon's acoustic guitar and begins to be picked up on Lennon's [[microphone]] or [[Pick up (music technology)|pick-up]] during the sounding of the chord. This gives the chord its special \"wavy\" and unstable quality. Pedler describes the effect as a \"virtual [[pull-off]]\".{{sfn|Pedler|2003|pp = 478\u2013479}}\n\nIn 2004, Jason Brown, a mathematics professor at [[Dalhousie University]], published a report titled \"Mathematics, Physics and 'A Hard Day's Night'\", in which he analysed the properties of the song's opening chord using [[Fourier transform]]s.{{sfn|Brown|2004}}  He concluded that Martin's piano contribution provided the important element in the chord beside Harrison's playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/10/how-a-professor/ |first=Eliot|last=Van Buskirk|title=How Math Unraveled the 'Hard Day's Night' Mystery|website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|date=31 October 2008|accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> In November the following year, ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' published an article on Brown's use of [[Celemony]]'s Melodyne Editor with [[Celemony#Melodyne Direct Note Access|Direct Note Access]] technology to further analyse the chord.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2009/11/can-celemonys-breakthrough-software-handle-the-hard-days-night-chord/ Celemony\u2019s Melodyne Makes Easy Work of 'Hard Day's Night'\"], ''Wired.com''.</ref> Brown's findings were partly challenged in 2012 by another mathematician, Kevin Houston from the [[University of Leeds]]. Houston, who also used a Fourier transform, attributed a greater importance in Lennon's contribution on acoustic guitar, rather than the piano notes played by Martin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/mathematician-cracks-beatles-mystery--perhaps-20120909-25lx1.html |first=John|last=von Radowitz|title=Mathematician cracks Beatles mystery \u2013 perhaps|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=9 September 2012|accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHarrison played a repeated guitar [[arpeggio]], outlining the notes of the opening chord, thereby ending the song in a circular fashion. Martin said that the ending was his idea: \"Again, that's film writing. I was stressing to them the importance of making the song fit, not actually finishing it but dangling on so that you're into the next mood.\"<ref name=\"rolling stone\">{{cite web|title='A Hard Day's Night'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/a-hard-days-night-19691231|work=100 Greatest Beatles Songs|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> The song contains 12 other chords.{{sfn|Jackson|2005|p = 112}}\n\n==Music==\nThe song is composed in the key of [[G major]]{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp = 236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Pollack}} and in a 4/4 [[time signature]].{{Sfn|Leonard|2003|p = 126}} The verse features the {{music|flat}}VII or major subtonic chord that was a part of the opening chord as an ornament or embellishment below the tonic. Transposed down a perfect fifth, the [[modal frame]] of the song though [[pentatonic]] features a [[ladder of thirds]] axially centred on G with a ceiling note of B{{music|flat}} and floor note of E{{music|flat}} (the low C being a [[passing tone]]).{{sfn|Middleton|1990|p = 203}}\n\nAccording to Middleton, the song, \"at first glance major-key-with-modal-touches\", reveals through its \"Line of Latent Mode\" \"a deep kinship with typical [[blues]] melodic structures: it is centred on three of the notes of the minor-pentatonic mode (E{{music|flat}}-G-B{{music|flat}}), with the contradictory major seventh (B{{music|natural}}) set against that. Moreover, the ''shape'' assumed by these notes \u2013 the modal ''frame'' \u2013 as well as the abstract scale they represent, is revealed, too; and this \u2013 an initial, repeated circling round the dominant (G), with an excursion to its minor third (B{{music|flat}}), 'answered' by a fall to the 'symmetrical' minor third of the tonic (E{{music|flat}}) \u2013 is a common pattern in blues.\"{{sfn|Middleton|1990|p = 201}}\n\nLennon opens the twelve-measure-long [[Verse (popular music)|verse]] and carries it along, suddenly joined at the end by McCartney, who then sings the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]].\n\n===Recording===\nDuring the recording of \"A Hard Day's Night\", Lennon and McCartney doubletracked their vocals throughout including the chorus. Lennon sings the lead vocal on the verses and Paul sings lead on the middle eight. During the chorus McCartney handles the high harmony and Lennon the low harmony. Take 7 reveals that the lyrics were still not set with Lennon singing \"you make me feel all right\" and McCartney and Harrison still unsteady with their respective lines, ending with Lennon chiding them with the line \"I heard a funny chord\".\n\nThe instrumental [[break (music)|break]], is played by Harrison on a Rickenbacker 12-string guitar, with Martin doubling on a piano recorded to tape at half-speed and then sped up to normal.<ref name=\"Recording\">{{cite book |title=[[Recording The Beatles]] |isbn=978-0-9785200-0-7 |first1=Brian |last1=Kehew |authorlink1=Brian Kehew |first2=Kevin |last2=Ryan |location=Curvebender Publishing |year=2006}}</ref> Recording this solo was the most time-consuming aspect of the session. A take that appeared on a bootleg in the 1980s reveals Harrison making multiple errors in his playing. In the description of ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s editors: \"But by the time the session ended at 10 that night, he had sculpted one of his most memorable solos \u2013 an upward run played twice and capped with a circular flourish, with the church-bell chime of his guitar echoed on piano by Martin.\"<ref name=\"rolling stone\" />\n\nThe song closes with Harrison<!-- on 12-string?

The singer sings about his tiredness when he comes home from work, but how the things that his lover does perk him up.  Critics have pointed out that the first verse, repeated as the last verse, exploits three worn-out-sounding cliches, \"a hard day's work\", \"working like a dog\" and \"sleeping like a log\", only to quicken up the pace with a patter-couplet reassuring the singer's girlfriend that his energy and pleasure level have been renewed by her ministrations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=John|title=Analysis of \"A Hard Day\u2019s Night\"|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/68460896/Berklee-Hard-Days-Night-Analysis|work=The Songs of John Lennon:The Beatles Years|publisher=Scribd Inc.|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"A Hard Day's Night\" was first released to the United States, coming out on 26 June 1964 on the album ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', the soundtrack to the film, and released by [[United Artists]]. It was the first song to be released before single release (see below).\n\nThe United Kingdom first heard \"A Hard Day's Night\" when it was released there on 10 July 1964, both on the album ''A Hard Day's Night'', and as a single, backed with \"Things We Said Today\" on the B-side. Both the album and single were released by [[Parlophone|Parlophone Records]]. The single began charting on 18 July 1964, a week later ousting [[the Rolling Stones]]' \"[[It's All Over Now]]\" from the top spot on the British charts on 25 July 1964, coincidentally the day when both the American and British albums too hit the peak of their respective charts. The single stayed on top for three weeks, and lasted another nine weeks in the charts afterwards.\n\nThe American single on 1 August started a two-week-long run at the top, setting a new record \u2013 nobody before had ever held the number one position on both the album and singles charts in the United Kingdom and the United States at the same time. The Beatles were the only ones who had done this until 1970 when [[Simon and Garfunkel]] achieved the same feat with their album ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' and its [[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|title track]].\n\nThe song was the fifth of seven songs by the Beatles to hit number 1 in a one-year period, an all-time record on the US charts. In order, these were \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\", \"[[She Loves You]]\", \"[[Can't Buy Me Love]]\", \"[[Love Me Do]]\", \"A Hard Day's Night\", \"[[I Feel Fine]]\" and \"[[Eight Days a Week]]\". It was also the sixth of seven songs written by Lennon-McCartney to hit number 1 in 1964, an all-time record on the US charts for writing the most songs to hit number 1 in the same calendar year (see [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones]]).\n\nThe song's opening chord{{sfn|Kruth|2015|p=104}} and closing arpeggios were highly influential on [[the Byrds]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=115}} After watching the film ''A Hard Day's Night'' and seeing Harrison's choice of guitar,{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=168}} [[Roger McGuinn]] adopted the Rickenbacker as his and the Byrds' signature instrument.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=150, 168}}{{sfn|Kruth|2015|pp=104\u201306}} In this way, according to author Andrew Grant Jackson, \"A Hard Day's Night\" \"birthed\" the folk-rock sound that the Byrds popularised in 1965.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=256}} That same year, \"A Hard Day's Night\" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group]]. {{RS500S|154}}{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2007}}\n\n==Personnel==\nPersonnel per [[Ian MacDonald]]{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p = 115}}\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 [[Double tracking|double-tracked]] vocals (verses), electric and acoustic rhythm guitars\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 double-tracked vocals (middle-eight), harmony vocal, bass\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 [[Twelve-string guitar|twelve-string lead guitar]]\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 drums, [[Bongo drum|bongos]], [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]\n*[[George Martin]] \u2013 piano/producer\n\n== In popular culture ==\n* \"A Hard Day's Night\" was used as wake-up music on [[Space Shuttle]] Missions [[STS-30]], [[STS-61]], and [[STS-69]].{{sfn|Fries|2009}}\n* The song was played to conclude the [[Channel Four]] breakfast programme ''The Channel Four Daily'' in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barnes|first=Steve|title=Channel 4 News|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/channel4/news.html|work=TVARK|accessdate=22 August 2013|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823195407/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/channel4/news.html|archivedate=23 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Live renditions==\nThe Beatles regularly played the song live throughout 1965.\n\nDuring his 2016 [[One on One (tour)|One on One tour]], Paul McCartney played the song for the first time as a solo artist and for the first time by a Beatle in half a century.

is a song by the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Beatles]]. Credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], it was written by [[John Lennon]],{{sfn|Turner Classic Movies|2009}} with some collaboration from [[Paul McCartney]]. It was released on the [[A Hard Day's Night (album)|film soundtrack of the same name]] in 1964. It was also released in the UK as a single, with \"[[Things We Said Today]]\" as its [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].\n\nThe song featured prominently on the [[A Hard Day's Night (album)|soundtrack]] to the Beatles' first [[feature film]], ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', and was on their album of the same name. The song topped the charts in both the United Kingdom and United States when it was released as a single. The American and British singles of \"A Hard Day's Night\" as well as both the American and British albums of the same title all held the top position in their respective charts for a couple of weeks in August 1964, the first time any artist had accomplished this feat.{{sfn|White|2008}}\n\n==Title==\nThe song's title originated from something said by [[Ringo Starr]], the Beatles' drummer. Starr described it this way in an interview with [[disc jockey]] [[Dave Hull]] in 1964: \"We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day \u2026' and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, '\u2026 night!' So we came to 'A Hard Day's Night.'\"{{sfn|Badman|p = 93}}\n\nStarr's statement was the inspiration for the title of the film, which in turn inspired the composition of the song. According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine: \"I was going home in the car and [[Richard Lester|Dick Lester]] [director of the movie] suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in ''[[In His Own Write]]'' [a book Lennon was writing then], but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those [[malapropism]]s. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny \u2026 just said it. So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|pp = 174\u2013175}}\n\nIn a 1994 interview for ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, basically stating that it was the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come up with the idea of using Starr's verbal misstep: \"The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session \u2026 and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical \u2026 they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'\"{{sfn|Miles|1997|p = 164}}\n\nIn 1996, yet another version of events cropped up. In an [[Associated Press]] report, the producer of the film ''A Hard Day's Night'', Walter Shenson, stated that Lennon described to Shenson some of Starr's funnier gaffes, including \"a hard day's night\", whereupon Shenson immediately decided that that was going to be the title of the movie (replacing other alternatives, including ''Beatlemania'').{{sfn|Harry|2000|p = 486}} Shenson then told Lennon that he needed a theme song for the film.{{sfn|Campbell|1996}}\n\n==Composition==\nLennon dashed off the song in one night, and brought it in for comments the following morning.  As he described in his 1980 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, \"the next morning I brought in the song \u2026 'cuz there was a little competition between Paul and I as to who got the A-side \u2013 who got the hits. If you notice, in the early days the majority of singles, in the movies and everything, were mine \u2026 in the early period I'm dominating the group \u2026 The reason Paul sang on 'A Hard Day's Night' (in the bridge) is because I couldn't reach the notes.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|pp = 174\u2013175}} However, McCartney and others{{who|date=April 2020}} remember McCartney collaborating with Lennon.{{sfn|Compton|2017|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nOn 16 April 1964, the Beatles gathered at Studio 2 of the [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] and recorded \"A Hard Day's Night\". It took them less than three hours to polish the song for its final release, eventually selecting the ninth take as the one to be released.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p = 43}}  ''[[Evening Standard]]'' journalist [[Maureen Cleave]] described a memorable taxi ride the morning the song was recorded:\n\n{{quote|One day I picked John up in a taxi and took him to Abbey Road for a recording session. The tune to the song 'A Hard Day's Night' was in his head, the words scrawled on a [[birthday card]] from a fan to his little son Julian: 'When I get home to you,' it said, 'I find my tiredness is through \u2026' Rather a feeble line about tiredness, I said. 'OK,' he said cheerfully and, borrowing my pen, instantly changed it to the slightly suggestive: 'When I get home to you/I find the things that you do/Will make me feel all right.' The other Beatles were there in the studio and, of course, the wonderful George Martin. John sort of hummed the tune to the others \u2013 they had no copies of the words or anything else. Three hours later I was none the wiser about how they\u2019d done it but the record was made \u2013 and you can see the birthday card in the [[British Library]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Hard Day's Night|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/albums/a-hard-days-night/|publisher=The Beatles Bible|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the Associated Press report, Shenson described his recollection of what happened. At 8:30 in the morning, \"There were John and Paul with guitars at the ready and all the lyrics scribbled on matchbook covers. They played it and the next night recorded it.\" Shenson declared, \"It had the right beat and the arrangement was brilliant. These guys were geniuses.\"{{sfn|Campbell|1996}}\n\n==Opening chord==\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | header = {{Listen\n  | filename = A Hard Day's Night opening chord.ogg\n  | title    = {{nobold|Opening chord}}\n  | plain    = yes\n  | style    = float:right\n  | embed   = yes\n  }}\n  Possible chord options\n | image1 = A Hard Day's Night opening chord 2.png\n | caption1 = G7sus4\n | image2 = A Hard Day's Night opening chord 5.png\n | caption2 =  Dm7sus4\n | image3 = A Hard Day's Night opening chord 7.png\n | caption3 = Jason Brown's analysis, as published in his 2008 report \"Mathematics, Physics and 'A Hard Day's Night'\"\n | image4 = A Hard Day's Night opening chord 8.svg\n | caption4 = F9\n}}\n\n\"A Hard Day's Night\" is immediately identifiable due to the unmistakable [[Rickenbacker]] 360/12 12-string guitar's \"mighty opening chord\" played by [[George Harrison]].{{sfn|Jackson|2005|p = 112}} According to [[George Martin]], \"We knew it would open both the film and the soundtrack LP, so we wanted a particularly strong and effective beginning. The strident guitar chord was the perfect launch,\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p = 43}} having what [[Ian MacDonald]] called \"a significance in Beatles lore matched only by the concluding E [[major chord|major]] of \"[[A Day in the Life]]\", the two opening and closing the group's middle period of peak creativity\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p = 115}}\n\n[[musical analysis|Analysis]] of the chord has been debated,{{sfn|Hook|2005}} it having been described as G7add9[[eleventh chord#Fourth|sus4]],{{sfn|Glynn|2004|pp = 33, 68}} G7[[suspended chord|sus4]],{{sfn|Rooksby|2004|p = 61}}{{sfn|Leonard|2003|p = 126}} or G11sus4{{sfn|Jackson|2005|p = 112}} and others below.\n\nPart of the [[chord (music)|chord]] is an F[[ninth chord#Second|add9]] as confirmed by Harrison during an online chat on 15 February 2001:{{sfn|Pedler|2003|pp = 478\u2013479}}\n\n{{quote|Q: Mr Harrison, what is the opening chord you used for \"A Hard Day's Night\"?<br>A: It is F with a G on top, but you'll have to ask Paul about the [[bass note]] to get the proper story.}}\n\nAccording to [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] the opening chord has an introductory [[dominant (music)|dominant]] function because McCartney plays D in the bass: Harrison and Martin play F A C G, over the bass D, on [[twelve-string guitar]] and piano respectively, giving the chord a mixture-coloured neighbour, F; two diatonic neighbours, A and C; plus an [[nonchord tone#Unaccented|anticipation]] of the tonic, G \u2013 the major [[subtonic]] as played on guitar being a [[Borrowed chord#Borrowed chords|borrowed chord]] commonly used by the Beatles, first in \"[[P.S. I Love You (The Beatles song)|P.S. I Love You]]\" (see [[mode mixture]]), and later in \"[[Every Little Thing (Beatles song)|Every Little Thing]]\", \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\" and \"[[Got to Get You into My Life]]\" (in the latter two against a tonic [[pedal point|pedal]]).{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp = 236\u2013237}}\n\n[[Alan W. Pollack]] also interprets the chord as a surrogate dominant, the G being an [[nonchord tone#Unaccented|anticipation]] that resolves on the G major chord that opens the verse. He suggests it is a mixture of D minor, F major, and G major (missing the B).{{sfn|Pollack}} Tony Bacon calls it a Dm7sus4 (D F G A C),{{sfn|Bacon|2000|p = 5}} which is the [[minor seventh chord]] (plus the fourth, G) (for more information regarding chord functions see [[diatonic function]]).\n\nEverett points out that the chord relates to the Beatles' interest in [[pandiatonic]] [[harmony]].{{sfn|Everett|2001|p = 109}}\n\nDominic Pedler has also provided an interpretation of the chord,{{sfn|Pedler|2003|pp = 511\u201312}} with the Beatles and George Martin playing the following:\n*'''George Harrison:''' Fadd9 in 1st position on Rickenbacker 360/12 12-string electric guitar\n*'''John Lennon:''' Fadd9 in 1st position on a Gibson J-160E 6-string acoustic guitar\n*'''Paul McCartney:''' high D played on the D-string, 12th fret on Hofner 500/1 electric bass\n*'''George Martin:''' D2-G2-D3 played on a Steinway Grand Piano\n*'''Ringo Starr:''' subtle snare drum and ride cymbal\n\nThis gives the notes:\n'''G-B-D-F-A-C''' (the B is a harmonic). One of the interesting things about this chord (as described by Pedler) is how McCartney's high bass note reverberates inside the soundbox of Lennon's acoustic guitar and begins to be picked up on Lennon's [[microphone]] or [[Pick up (music technology)|pick-up]] during the sounding of the chord. This gives the chord its special \"wavy\" and unstable quality. Pedler describes the effect as a \"virtual [[pull-off]]\".{{sfn|Pedler|2003|pp = 478\u2013479}}\n\nIn 2004, Jason Brown, a mathematics professor at [[Dalhousie University]], published a report titled \"Mathematics, Physics and 'A Hard Day's Night'\", in which he analysed the properties of the song's opening chord using [[Fourier transform]]s.{{sfn|Brown|2004}}  He concluded that Martin's piano contribution provided the important element in the chord beside Harrison's playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/10/how-a-professor/ |first=Eliot|last=Van Buskirk|title=How Math Unraveled the 'Hard Day's Night' Mystery|website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|date=31 October 2008|accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> In November the following year, ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' published an article on Brown's use of [[Celemony]]'s Melodyne Editor with [[Celemony#Melodyne Direct Note Access|Direct Note Access]] technology to further analyse the chord.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2009/11/can-celemonys-breakthrough-software-handle-the-hard-days-night-chord/ Celemony\u2019s Melodyne Makes Easy Work of 'Hard Day's Night'\"], ''Wired.com''.</ref> Brown's findings were partly challenged in 2012 by another mathematician, Kevin Houston from the [[University of Leeds]]. Houston, who also used a Fourier transform, attributed a greater importance in Lennon's contribution on acoustic guitar, rather than the piano notes played by Martin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/mathematician-cracks-beatles-mystery--perhaps-20120909-25lx1.html |first=John|last=von Radowitz|title=Mathematician cracks Beatles mystery \u2013 perhaps|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=9 September 2012|accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHarrison played a repeated guitar [[arpeggio]], outlining the notes of the opening chord, thereby ending the song in a circular fashion. Martin said that the ending was his idea: \"Again, that's film writing. I was stressing to them the importance of making the song fit, not actually finishing it but dangling on so that you're into the next mood.\"<ref name=\"rolling stone\">{{cite web|title='A Hard Day's Night'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/a-hard-days-night-19691231|work=100 Greatest Beatles Songs|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> The song contains 12 other chords.{{sfn|Jackson|2005|p = 112}}\n\n==Music==\nThe song is composed in the key of [[G major]]{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp = 236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Pollack}} and in a 4/4 [[time signature]].{{Sfn|Leonard|2003|p = 126}} The verse features the {{music|flat}}VII or major subtonic chord that was a part of the opening chord as an ornament or embellishment below the tonic. Transposed down a perfect fifth, the [[modal frame]] of the song though [[pentatonic]] features a [[ladder of thirds]] axially centred on G with a ceiling note of B{{music|flat}} and floor note of E{{music|flat}} (the low C being a [[passing tone]]).{{sfn|Middleton|1990|p = 203}}\n\nAccording to Middleton, the song, \"at first glance major-key-with-modal-touches\", reveals through its \"Line of Latent Mode\" \"a deep kinship with typical [[blues]] melodic structures: it is centred on three of the notes of the minor-pentatonic mode (E{{music|flat}}-G-B{{music|flat}}), with the contradictory major seventh (B{{music|natural}}) set against that. Moreover, the ''shape'' assumed by these notes \u2013 the modal ''frame'' \u2013 as well as the abstract scale they represent, is revealed, too; and this \u2013 an initial, repeated circling round the dominant (G), with an excursion to its minor third (B{{music|flat}}), 'answered' by a fall to the 'symmetrical' minor third of the tonic (E{{music|flat}}) \u2013 is a common pattern in blues.\"{{sfn|Middleton|1990|p = 201}}\n\nLennon opens the twelve-measure-long [[Verse (popular music)|verse]] and carries it along, suddenly joined at the end by McCartney, who then sings the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]].\n\n===Recording===\nDuring the recording of \"A Hard Day's Night\", Lennon and McCartney doubletracked their vocals throughout including the chorus. Lennon sings the lead vocal on the verses and Paul sings lead on the middle eight. During the chorus McCartney handles the high harmony and Lennon the low harmony. Take 7 reveals that the lyrics were still not set with Lennon singing \"you make me feel all right\" and McCartney and Harrison still unsteady with their respective lines, ending with Lennon chiding them with the line \"I heard a funny chord\".\n\nThe instrumental [[break (music)|break]], is played by Harrison on a Rickenbacker 12-string guitar, with Martin doubling on a piano recorded to tape at half-speed and then sped up to normal.<ref name=\"Recording\">{{cite book |title=[[Recording The Beatles]] |isbn=978-0-9785200-0-7 |first1=Brian |last1=Kehew |authorlink1=Brian Kehew |first2=Kevin |last2=Ryan |location=Curvebender Publishing |year=2006}}</ref> Recording this solo was the most time-consuming aspect of the session. A take that appeared on a bootleg in the 1980s reveals Harrison making multiple errors in his playing. In the description of ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s editors: \"But by the time the session ended at 10 that night, he had sculpted one of his most memorable solos \u2013 an upward run played twice and capped with a circular flourish, with the church-bell chime of his guitar echoed on piano by Martin.\"<ref name=\"rolling stone\" />\n\nThe song closes with Harrison<!-- on 12-string? Leaving out for now. --> playing an [[arpeggio]] of the opening chord (Fadd9) during the fade-out.\n\n===Lyrics===\nThe lyrics speak about the singer's undying devotion to his lover, and how he works so she can buy the things she wants. The singer sings about his tiredness when he comes home from work, but how the things that his lover does perk him up.  Critics have pointed out that the first verse, repeated as the last verse, exploits three worn-out-sounding cliches, \"a hard day's work\", \"working like a dog\" and \"sleeping like a log\", only to quicken up the pace with a patter-couplet reassuring the singer's girlfriend that his energy and pleasure level have been renewed by her ministrations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=John|title=Analysis of \"A Hard Day\u2019s Night\"|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/68460896/Berklee-Hard-Days-Night-Analysis|work=The Songs of John Lennon:The Beatles Years|publisher=Scribd Inc.|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"A Hard Day's Night\" was first released to the United States, coming out on 26 June 1964 on the album ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', the soundtrack to the film, and released by [[United Artists]]. It was the first song to be released before single release (see below).\n\nThe United Kingdom first heard \"A Hard Day's Night\" when it was released there on 10 July 1964, both on the album ''A Hard Day's Night'', and as a single, backed with \"Things We Said Today\" on the B-side. Both the album and single were released by [[Parlophone|Parlophone Records]]. The single began charting on 18 July 1964, a week later ousting [[the Rolling Stones]]' \"[[It's All Over Now]]\" from the top spot on the British charts on 25 July 1964, coincidentally the day when both the American and British albums too hit the peak of their respective charts. The single stayed on top for three weeks, and lasted another nine weeks in the charts afterwards.\n\nThe American single on 1 August started a two-week-long run at the top, setting a new record \u2013 nobody before had ever held the number one position on both the album and singles charts in the United Kingdom and the United States at the same time. The Beatles were the only ones who had done this until 1970 when [[Simon and Garfunkel]] achieved the same feat with their album ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' and its [[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|title track]].\n\nThe song was the fifth of seven songs by the Beatles to hit number 1 in a one-year period, an all-time record on the US charts. In order, these were \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\", \"[[She Loves You]]\", \"[[Can't Buy Me Love]]\", \"[[Love Me Do]]\", \"A Hard Day's Night\", \"[[I Feel Fine]]\" and \"[[Eight Days a Week]]\". It was also the sixth of seven songs written by Lennon-McCartney to hit number 1 in 1964, an all-time record on the US charts for writing the most songs to hit number 1 in the same calendar year (see [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones]]).\n\nThe song's opening chord{{sfn|Kruth|2015|p=104}} and closing arpeggios were highly influential on [[the Byrds]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=115}} After watching the film ''A Hard Day's Night'' and seeing Harrison's choice of guitar,{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=168}} [[Roger McGuinn]] adopted the Rickenbacker as his and the Byrds' signature instrument.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=150, 168}}{{sfn|Kruth|2015|pp=104\u201306}} In this way, according to author Andrew Grant Jackson, \"A Hard Day's Night\" \"birthed\" the folk-rock sound that the Byrds popularised in 1965.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=256}} That same year, \"A Hard Day's Night\" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group]]. {{RS500S|154}}{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2007}}\n\n==Personnel==\nPersonnel per [[Ian MacDonald]]{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p = 115}}\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 [[Double tracking|double-tracked]] vocals (verses), electric and acoustic rhythm guitars\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 double-tracked vocals (middle-eight), harmony vocal, bass\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 [[Twelve-string guitar|twelve-string lead guitar]]\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 drums, [[Bongo drum|bongos]], [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]\n*[[George Martin]] \u2013 piano/producer\n\n== In popular culture ==\n* \"A Hard Day's Night\" was used as wake-up music on [[Space Shuttle]] Missions [[STS-30]], [[STS-61]], and [[STS-69]].{{sfn|Fries|2009}}\n* The song was played to conclude the [[Channel Four]] breakfast programme ''The Channel Four Daily'' in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barnes|first=Steve|title=Channel 4 News|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/channel4/news.html|work=TVARK|accessdate=22 August 2013|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823195407/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/channel4/news.html|archivedate=23 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Live renditions==\nThe Beatles regularly played the song live throughout 1965.\n\nDuring his 2016 [[One on One (tour)|One on One tour]], Paul McCartney played the song for the first time as a solo artist and for the first time by a Beatle in half a century.

He led the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) as chairman from 2006 to 2007. He previously served as [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] from 2002 to 2005. As one of the founding members of the DPP, he is seen as a loyalist of President [[Chen Shui-bian]]. He is a strong advocate of [[Taiwan independence]].\n\n==Personal background==\nBorn in Taihe Village (\u592a\u548c\u6751), [[Dongshan, Yilan|Dongshan Township]], [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]], Yu was raised in a poor [[tenant farming]] family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2002/bio_yu.htm |title=Yu Shyi-kun |publisher=Government Information Office |accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref> When he was 13, he studied at the Taiwan provincial Yilan High school (which today is the [[National Yilan Senior High School]]), his house was destroyed by flood waters during [[1961 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Pamela|typhoon Pamela]], and his father died of [[tuberculosis]] in the same year. He quit junior high school to work full-time on his family farm.\n\nAt 19, he studied at the supplementary night school of the Lotung Commercial High School. He moved to [[Taipei]] to enroll in the supplementary school of the Hsihu Commercial and Industrial High School. He studied international commerce at the [[Chihlee Institute of Technology]] (\u81f4\u7406\u5546\u5c08) and public administration at the [[National Chung Hsing University]]. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in politics in [[Tunghai University]] in 1985 at the age of 37.\n\n==Rise in politics==\nIn 1981 he was elected a member of the [[Taiwan Provincial Assembly]] for Yilan County. Yu, [[Su Tseng-chang]], and [[Hsieh San-sheng]] made the so-called \"iron triangle\" in the Assembly. The three were the only members ever to resign from the Assembly.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1984 he was the [[Tangwai]] Secretary-General. He became Convener of Tangwai National Election Backing Committee in 1986. As a founding member of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], he was a member of its Central Committee from 1984 to 1986 and its [[Central Standing Committee]] from 1986 to 1990 when he was elected a Magistrate of Ilan County, during which he was a member of the Educational Reform Committee of the Executive Yuan from 1994 to 1996. In his second term of magistrate, Environmental Protection (\u74b0\u4fdd\u7acb\u7e23), Tourism (\u89c0\u5149\u7acb\u7e23), Information Promotion (\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7acb\u7e23), and Culture (\u6587\u5316\u7acb\u7e23) were his four main goals in administration. The successful planning and execution let him ranked the first one of 27 mayors/magistrates in Taiwan. After the completion of his two terms as magistrate in 1997, he was in 1998 appointed Chairman of the [[Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation]] by then Mayor [[Chen Shui-bian]]. He resigned in 1999 to become Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party.\n\nHe was the chief spokesman for the DPP campaign in the [[2000 ROC presidential election|2000 presidential election]]. With Chen Shui-bian's election to the [[president of the Republic of China|presidency]], he was appointed Vice Premier under Premier [[Tang Fei]].\n\nIn July 2000, four construction workers were trapped by the rising floodwaters of Pachang Creek. As local and central government authorities squabbled for three hours over who would send out a rescue helicopter, the men drowned. In the public outrage that ensued, officials up the chain of command, including Premier Tang, tendered their resignations. Vice Premier Yu, who was also chairman of the Committee of Disaster Relief and Prevention, had his resignation accepted.\n\nSix months later, Yu rejoined the administration as Secretary-General to the Office of the President and served until his promotion to the premiership on February 1, 2002.\n\n== Premiership ==\nAs premier, Yu defended the administration's position on the [[2004 ROC referendum|peace referendum]] and promoted a NT$610.8 billion arms procurement package in 2004. He caused some minor controversy when he used the designation \"Taiwan, ROC\" on an official visit to Honduras. Chen later said he preferred \"Taiwan.\" In September 2004, he directed the government to refer to the People's Republic of China in official documents as simply \"China\" as opposed to \"[[mainland China]]\" or \"Communist China\" as was previously done in order to highlight a \"separate Taiwanese identity.\" This move was not endorsed by the Presidential Office and the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] clarified that it would only apply to internal documents.\n \nYu and his cabinet resigned ''en masse'' following the pan-Green Coalition failure to gain a majority in the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|2004 legislative elections]]. In the ensuing cabinet shuffle, Yu was returned to the presidential office as secretary-general and succeeded as premier by [[Frank Hsieh]].\n\nOn January 15, 2006 he was elected chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party with 54% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4613796.stm |title=Taiwan's top party picks new boss |publisher=BBC  \n|date = January 15, 2006 |accessdate = 2007-11-02}}</ref>\n\nYu was a candidate for the DPP nomination for the [[2008 ROC presidential election|2008 presidential election]].

He led the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) as chairman from 2006 to 2007. He previously served as [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] from 2002 to 2005. As one of the founding members of the DPP, he is seen as a loyalist of President [[Chen Shui-bian]]. He is a strong advocate of [[Taiwan independence]].\n\n==Personal background==\nBorn in Taihe Village (\u592a\u548c\u6751), [[Dongshan, Yilan|Dongshan Township]], [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]], Yu was raised in a poor [[tenant farming]] family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2002/bio_yu.htm |title=Yu Shyi-kun |publisher=Government Information Office |accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref> When he was 13, he studied at the Taiwan provincial Yilan High school (which today is the [[National Yilan Senior High School]]), his house was destroyed by flood waters during [[1961 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Pamela|typhoon Pamela]], and his father died of [[tuberculosis]] in the same year. He quit junior high school to work full-time on his family farm.\n\nAt 19, he studied at the supplementary night school of the Lotung Commercial High School. He moved to [[Taipei]] to enroll in the supplementary school of the Hsihu Commercial and Industrial High School. He studied international commerce at the [[Chihlee Institute of Technology]] (\u81f4\u7406\u5546\u5c08) and public administration at the [[National Chung Hsing University]]. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in politics in [[Tunghai University]] in 1985 at the age of 37.\n\n==Rise in politics==\nIn 1981 he was elected a member of the [[Taiwan Provincial Assembly]] for Yilan County. Yu, [[Su Tseng-chang]], and [[Hsieh San-sheng]] made the so-called \"iron triangle\" in the Assembly. The three were the only members ever to resign from the Assembly.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1984 he was the [[Tangwai]] Secretary-General. He became Convener of Tangwai National Election Backing Committee in 1986. As a founding member of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], he was a member of its Central Committee from 1984 to 1986 and its [[Central Standing Committee]] from 1986 to 1990 when he was elected a Magistrate of Ilan County, during which he was a member of the Educational Reform Committee of the Executive Yuan from 1994 to 1996. In his second term of magistrate, Environmental Protection (\u74b0\u4fdd\u7acb\u7e23), Tourism (\u89c0\u5149\u7acb\u7e23), Information Promotion (\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7acb\u7e23), and Culture (\u6587\u5316\u7acb\u7e23) were his four main goals in administration. The successful planning and execution let him ranked the first one of 27 mayors/magistrates in Taiwan. After the completion of his two terms as magistrate in 1997, he was in 1998 appointed Chairman of the [[Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation]] by then Mayor [[Chen Shui-bian]]. He resigned in 1999 to become Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party.\n\nHe was the chief spokesman for the DPP campaign in the [[2000 ROC presidential election|2000 presidential election]]. With Chen Shui-bian's election to the [[president of the Republic of China|presidency]], he was appointed Vice Premier under Premier [[Tang Fei]].\n\nIn July 2000, four construction workers were trapped by the rising floodwaters of Pachang Creek. As local and central government authorities squabbled for three hours over who would send out a rescue helicopter, the men drowned. In the public outrage that ensued, officials up the chain of command, including Premier Tang, tendered their resignations. Vice Premier Yu, who was also chairman of the Committee of Disaster Relief and Prevention, had his resignation accepted.\n\nSix months later, Yu rejoined the administration as Secretary-General to the Office of the President and served until his promotion to the premiership on February 1, 2002.\n\n== Premiership ==\nAs premier, Yu defended the administration's position on the [[2004 ROC referendum|peace referendum]] and promoted a NT$610.8 billion arms procurement package in 2004. He caused some minor controversy when he used the designation \"Taiwan, ROC\" on an official visit to Honduras. Chen later said he preferred \"Taiwan.\" In September 2004, he directed the government to refer to the People's Republic of China in official documents as simply \"China\" as opposed to \"[[mainland China]]\" or \"Communist China\" as was previously done in order to highlight a \"separate Taiwanese identity.\" This move was not endorsed by the Presidential Office and the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] clarified that it would only apply to internal documents.\n \nYu and his cabinet resigned ''en masse'' following the pan-Green Coalition failure to gain a majority in the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|2004 legislative elections]]. In the ensuing cabinet shuffle, Yu was returned to the presidential office as secretary-general and succeeded as premier by [[Frank Hsieh]].\n\nOn January 15, 2006 he was elected chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party with 54% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4613796.stm |title=Taiwan's top party picks new boss |publisher=BBC  \n|date = January 15, 2006 |accessdate = 2007-11-02}}</ref>\n\nYu was a candidate for the DPP nomination for the [[2008 ROC presidential election|2008 presidential election]].
