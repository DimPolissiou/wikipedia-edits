Both names are still used, although most recent authors now accept ''macrocephalus'' as the valid name, limiting ''catodon''{{'s}} status to a lesser synonym. Until 1974, the species was generally known as ''P. catodon''. In that year, however, Dutch zoologists Antonius M. Husson and Lipke Holthuis proposed that the correct name should be ''P. macrocephalus'', the second name in the genus ''Physeter'' published by Linnaeus concurrently with ''P. catodon''. This proposition was based on the grounds that the names were synonyms published simultaneously, and, therefore, the ICZN [[Principle of the First Reviser]] should apply. In this instance, it led to the choice of ''P. macrocephalus'' over ''P. catodon'', a view re-stated in Holthuis, 1987.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Holthuis L.

It is the largest among the toothed whales, weighing about 170&nbsp;g.  It is overall ellipsoid in shape, compressed along the visual axis, measuring about 7\u00d77\u00d73&nbsp;cm. The [[cornea]] is elliptical and the lens is spherical.  The [[sclera]] is very hard and thick, roughly 1&nbsp;cm anteriorly and 3&nbsp;cm posteriorly. There are no [[ciliary muscle]]s. The [[choroid]] is very thick and contains a fibrous ''[[tapetum lucidum]]''. Like other toothed whales, the sperm whale can retract and protrude its eyes, thanks to a 2-cm-thick retractor muscle attached around the eye at the equator,<ref name=Bjerager2003>{{cite journal|author1=Bjerager, P. |author2=Heegaard, S. |author3=Tougaar, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Anatomy of the eye of the sperm whale (''Physeter macrocephalus'' L.)|doi=10.1578/016754203101024059|year=2003|journal=Aquatic Mammals|volume=29|pages=31\u201336|issue=1}}</ref> but are unable to roll the eyes in their sockets.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Macroanatomy-of-the-sperm-whale-eye-A-The-eye-seen-from-the-side-anterior-to-the_fig1_236115733 Macroanatomy of the sperm whale eye]</ref>\n\nAccording to Fristrup and Harbison (2002),<ref name=\"FristrupHarbison2002\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2002.tb01017.x|title=How do sperm whales catch squids?|year= 2002 |first1= K.

They conjectured that sperm whales use vision to hunt squid, either by detecting silhouettes from below or by detecting bioluminescence. If sperm whales detect silhouettes, Fristrup and Harbison suggested that they hunt upside down, allowing them to use the forward parts of the ventral [[visual field]]s for [[binocular vision]].\n\n===Sleeping===\nFor some time researchers have been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods, assuming a vertical position with their heads just below or at the surface. A 2008 study published in ''[[Current Biology]]'' recorded evidence that whales may sleep with both sides of the brain. It appears that some whales may fall into a deep sleep for about 7 percent of the time, most often between 6 p.m. and midnight.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sperm Whales Sleep While 'Drifting' Vertically, Scientists Say (VIDEO) |first=Jacqueline |last=Howard |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/08/sperm-whales-sleep_n_1757951.html |newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=2012-09-08 |accessdate=2013-02-08}}</ref>\n\n===Genetics===\nSperm whales have 21 pairs of chromosomes ([[karyotype|2n=42]]).<ref name=\"Arnason1981\">{{Cite journal | last1 = \u00c1rnason | first1 = U. | title = Banding studies on the gray and sperm whale karyotypes | doi = 10.1111/j.1601-5223.1981.tb01418.x | journal = Hereditas | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 277\u2013281 | year = 2009 | pmid =  7309542| pmc = }}</ref> The genome of live whales can be examined by recovering shed skin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seaswap.info/study/genetics.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105161744/http://www.seaswap.info/study/genetics.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-01-05 |title=SEASWAP: Genetic Sampling |publisher=Seaswap.info|accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref>\n\n==Vocalization complex==\nCapable of emitting sounds at a volume of 230 [[decibel]]s\u2014more than an airplane [[jet engine]] at takeoff\u2014the sperm whale is the loudest animal in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160331-the-worlds-loudest-animal-might-surprise-you|title=The world's loudest animal might surprise you|last=Davies|first=Ella|website=BBC|language=en|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref>\n\n===Mechanism===\nWhen [[Animal echolocation|echolocating]], the sperm whale emits a directionally focused beam of broadband clicks. Clicks are generated by forcing air through a pair of phonic lips (also known as \"monkey lips\" or \"museau de singe\") at the front end of the nose, just below the blowhole. The sound then travels backwards along the length of the nose through the spermaceti organ. Most of the sound energy is then reflected off the frontal sac at the cranium and into the melon, whose lens-like structure focuses it.<ref name=\"Cranford2000ImpulseSoundSources\"/><ref name=\"Zimmer, W.M.X., Tyack, P.L., Johnson, M.P. & Madsen, P.T. 2005 1473\u20131485\"/><ref name=\"Norris, K.S. & Harvey, G.W. 1972 397\u2013417\"/><ref name=\"Cranford, T.W. 1999 1133\u20131157\"/><ref name=\"Madsen, P.T., Payne, R., Kristiansen, N.U., Wahlberg, M., Kerr, I. & M\u00f8hl, B. 2002 1899\u20131906\"/><ref name=\"M\u00f8hl, B. 2001 335\u2013340\"/><ref name=\"M\u00f8hl, B., Wahlberg, M., Madsen, P.T., Miller, L.A. & Surlykke, A. 2000 638\u2013648\"/><ref name=\"M\u00f8hl, B., Wahlberg, M., Madsen, P.T., Heerfordt, A. & Lund, A. 2003 1143\u20131154\"/> Some of the sound will reflect back into the spermaceti organ and back towards the front of the whale's nose, where it will be reflected through the spermaceti organ a third time.

While the left nasal passage opens to the blow hole, the right nasal passage has evolved to supply air to the phonic lips.

It was a way for whalers to pass the time between hunts.]]\nThe sperm whale's ivory-like teeth were often sought by 18th- and 19th-century whalers, who used them to produce inked carvings known as ''[[scrimshaw]].'' 30 teeth of the sperm whale can be used for ivory. Each of these teeth, up to {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} across, are hollow for the first half of their length. Like [[walrus]] ivory, sperm whale ivory has two distinct layers. However, sperm whale ivory contains a much thicker inner layer. Though a widely practised art in the 19th century, scrimshaw using genuine sperm whale ivory declined substantially after the retirement of the whaling fleets in the 1880s. Currently the [[Endangered Species Act]] and [[CITES|the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES), prevents the sales of or trade in sperm whale ivory harvested after 1973 or scrimshaw crafted from it.\n\nModern whaling was more efficient than open-boat whaling, employing steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large [[baleen whale]]s, but as these populations were taken, sperm whaling increased. [[Spermaceti]], the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales, was in high demand. In both the 1941-1942 and 1942-1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales off the coast of Peru alone. After [[World War II]], whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high-performance machinery, such as automobile transmissions.\n\nThe hunting led to the near-extinction of large whales, including sperm whales, until bans on whale oil use were instituted in 1972. The [[International Whaling Commission]] gave the species full protection in 1985, but hunting by [[Japan]] in the northern [[Pacific Ocean]] continued until 1988.<ref name=\"whiteheadwhaling\" />\n\nIt is estimated that the historic worldwide population numbered 1,100,000 before commercial sperm whaling began in the early 18th century.<ref name=\"iucn\" /> By 1880, it had declined by an estimated 29 percent.<ref name=\"iucn\" /> From that date until 1946, the population appears to have partially recovered as whaling activity decreased, but after the Second World War, the population declined even further, to 33 per cent of the pre-whaling population.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Between 184,000 and 236,000 sperm whales were killed by the various whaling nations in the 19th century,<ref>{{cite book|title=In Pursuit of Leviathan: Technology, Institutions, Productivity, and Profits in American Whaling, 1816\u20131906 (National Bureau of Economic Research Series on Long-Term Factors in Economic Dev)|author=Davis, L|author2=Gallman, R.|author3=Gleiter, K.|last-author-amp=yes|page=135|year=1997|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-13789-6}}</ref> while in the 20th century, at least 770,000 were taken, the majority between 1946 and 1980.<ref>Over 680,000 officially reported at {{cite web|title=Whaling Statistics |url=http://luna.pos.to/whale/sta.html |accessdate=2008-10-15 }}.

Both names are still used, although most recent authors now accept ''macrocephalus'' as the valid name, limiting ''catodon''{{'s}} status to a lesser synonym. Until 1974, the species was generally known as ''P. catodon''. In that year, however, Dutch zoologists Antonius M. Husson and Lipke Holthuis proposed that the correct name should be ''P. macrocephalus'', the second name in the genus ''Physeter'' published by Linnaeus concurrently with ''P. catodon''. This proposition was based on the grounds that the names were synonyms published simultaneously, and, therefore, the ICZN [[Principle of the First Reviser]] should apply. In this instance, it led to the choice of ''P. macrocephalus'' over ''P. catodon'', a view re-stated in Holthuis, 1987.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Holthuis L.

It was a way for whalers to pass the time between hunts.]]\nThe sperm whale's ivory-like teeth were often sought by 18th- and 19th-century whalers, who used them to produce inked carvings known as ''[[scrimshaw]].'' 30 teeth of the sperm whale can be used for ivory. Each of these teeth, up to {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} across, are hollow for the first half of their length. Like [[walrus]] ivory, sperm whale ivory has two distinct layers. However, sperm whale ivory contains a much thicker inner layer. Though a widely practised art in the 19th century, scrimshaw using genuine sperm whale ivory declined substantially after the retirement of the whaling fleets in the 1880s. Currently the [[Endangered Species Act]] and [[CITES|the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES), prevents the sales of or trade in sperm whale ivory harvested after 1973 or scrimshaw crafted from it.\n\nModern whaling was more efficient than open-boat whaling, employing steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large [[baleen whale]]s, but as these populations were taken, sperm whaling increased. [[Spermaceti]], the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales, was in high demand. In both the 1941-1942 and 1942-1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales off the coast of Peru alone. After [[World War II]], whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high-performance machinery, such as automobile transmissions.\n\nThe hunting led to the near-extinction of large whales, including sperm whales, until bans on whale oil use were instituted in 1972. The [[International Whaling Commission]] gave the species full protection in 1985, but hunting by [[Japan]] in the northern [[Pacific Ocean]] continued until 1988.<ref name=\"whiteheadwhaling\" />\n\nIt is estimated that the historic worldwide population numbered 1,100,000 before commercial sperm whaling began in the early 18th century.<ref name=\"iucn\" /> By 1880, it had declined by an estimated 29 percent.<ref name=\"iucn\" /> From that date until 1946, the population appears to have partially recovered as whaling activity decreased, but after the Second World War, the population declined even further, to 33 per cent of the pre-whaling population.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Between 184,000 and 236,000 sperm whales were killed by the various whaling nations in the 19th century,<ref>{{cite book|title=In Pursuit of Leviathan: Technology, Institutions, Productivity, and Profits in American Whaling, 1816\u20131906 (National Bureau of Economic Research Series on Long-Term Factors in Economic Dev)|author=Davis, L|author2=Gallman, R.|author3=Gleiter, K.|last-author-amp=yes|page=135|year=1997|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-13789-6}}</ref> while in the 20th century, at least 770,000 were taken, the majority between 1946 and 1980.<ref>Over 680,000 officially reported at {{cite web|title=Whaling Statistics |url=http://luna.pos.to/whale/sta.html |accessdate=2008-10-15 }}.

Popular locations for sperm whale watching include the town of [[Kaikoura]] on [[New Zealand]]'s [[South Island]], [[Andenes]] and [[Troms\u00f8]] in Arctic [[Norway]]; as well as the [[Azores]], where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore,<ref name=\"whiteheadrange\" /><ref>{{cite web|title= Whale and dolphin watching in the Azores |url= http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/whales/azores/#cr |publisher=Wildlife Extra|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> and [[Dominica]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Whale Watching Dominica|url=http://www.dominica.dm/site/whalewatching.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127084646/http://www.dominica.dm/site/whalewatching.cfm|archivedate=2010-01-27|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dominica Sperm Whale Project|url=http://www.thespermwhaleproject.org|accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref>\n\n===Plastic waste===\n<!-- not sure if this shouldn't be under ecology-->\nThe introduction of [[Plastic pollution|plastic waste]] to the ocean environment by humans is relatively new.

With the assistance of [[Sidney Webb]], Henderson designed a new [[Labour Party Constitution|constitution for the Labour Party]] in which it adopted a strongly [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] platform in 1918 to ensure that it would not lose support to the new [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], exemplified by [[Clause IV]] of the constitution.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2006|pp=46\u201347}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00015, Friedrich Ebert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Friedrich Ebert]], [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|president of Germany]] (1919\u20131925)]]\nThe overthrow of the tsarist regime in Russia in February 1917 impacted politics in Germany as it ended the legitimation used by Ebert and other pro-war SPD members that Germany was in the war against a reactionary Russian government. With the overthrow of the tsar and revolutionary socialist agitation increased in Russia, such events influenced socialists in Germany.{{sfn|Chickering|p=155}}\n\nWith rising bread shortages in Germany amid war rationing, mass strikes occurred beginning in April 1917 with 300,000 strikers taking part in a strike in Berlin. The strikers demanded bread, freedom, peace and the formation of [[workers' council]]s as was being done in Russia. Amidst the German public's uproar, the SPD alongside the [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressives]] and the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic]] labour movement in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] put forward the [[Reichstag Peace Resolution|Peace Resolution]] on 19 July 1917 that called for a compromise peace to end the war which was passed by a majority of members of the Reichstag.{{sfn|Chickering|p=155}}\n\nThe German High Command opposed the Peace Resolution, but it did seek to end the war with Russia and presented the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] to the [[Bolshevik government]] in 1918 that agreed to the terms and the Reichstag passed the treaty which included the support of the SPD, the Progressives and the Catholic political movement.{{sfn|Chickering|p=155}}\n\nBy late 1918, the war situation for Germany had become hopeless and [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] was pressured to make peace. Wilhelm II appointed a new cabinet that included SPD members. At the same time, the Imperial Naval Command was determined to make a heroic last stand against the British [[Royal Navy]]. On 24 October 1918, it issued orders for the German Navy to depart to confront, but the sailors refused, resulting in the [[Kiel mutiny]].{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nThe Kiel mutiny resulted in [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|revolution]]. Faced with military failure and revolution, [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] resigned, giving SPD leader Ebert the position of Chancellor. Wihelm II abdicated the German throne immediately afterwards and the German High Command officials [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]] resigned whilst refusing to end the war to save face, leaving the Ebert government and the SPD-majority Reichstag to be forced to make the inevitable peace with the Allies and take the blame for having lost the war. With the abdication of Wilhelm II, Ebert declared Germany to be a republic and signed the armistice that ended World War I on 11 November 1918.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nThe new social democratic government in Germany faced political violence in Berlin by a movement of [[Communism|communist]] revolutionaries known as the [[Spartacist League]], who sought to repeat the feat of Lenin and the Bolsheviks in Russia by overthrowing the German government.{{sfn|Childs|2000|p=2}} Tensions between the governing majority of Social Democrats led by Ebert versus the strongly [[left-wing]] elements of the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) and communists over Ebert's refusal to immediately reform the German Army resulted in the January rising by the newly formed [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the USPD which saw communists mobilizing a large workers' demonstration.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nThe SPD responded by holding a counter-demonstration that was effective in demonstrating support for the government and the USPD soon withdrew its support for the rising.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}} However, the communists continued to revolt and between 12 and 28 January 1919 communist forces had seized control of several government buildings in Berlin. Ebert responded by requesting that defense minister [[Gustav Noske]] take charge of loyal soldiers to fight the communists and secure the government.{{sfn|Childs|2000|p=2}} Ebert was furious with the communists' intransigence and said that he wished \"to teach the radicals a lesson they would never forget\".{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nNoske was able to rally groups of mostly reactionary former soldiers, known as the [[Freikorps]], who were eager to fight the communists. The situation soon went completely out of control when the recruited Freikorps went on a violent rampage against workers and murdered the communist leaders [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. The atrocities by the government-recruited Freikorps against the communist revolutionaries badly tarnished the reputation of the SPD and strengthened the confidence of reactionary forces.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nIn spite of this, the SPD was able to win the largest number of seats in the [[1919 German federal election|parliamentary election held on 19 January 1919]] and Ebert was elected [[president of Germany]]. However, the USPD refused to support the government in response to the atrocities committed by the SPD government-recruited ''Freikorps''.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nDue to the unrest in Berlin, the drafting of the constitution of the new German republic was undertaken in the city of Weimar and the following political era is referred to as the [[Weimar Republic]]. Upon founding the new government, President Ebert cooperated with liberal members of his coalition government to create the [[Weimar constitution]] and sought to begin a program of nationalization of certain sectors of the economy. Political unrest and violence continued and the government's continued reliance on the help of the far-right and [[counter-revolutionary]] Freikorps militias to fight the [[revolutionary]] Spartacists further alienated potential left-wing support for the SPD.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=146}}\n\nThe SPD coalition government's acceptance of the harsh peace conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919 infuriated the German right, including the Freikorps that had previously been willing to cooperate with the government to fight the Spartacists. In the June 1919 German federal election, the SPD's share of the vote significantly declined due to their previous ties to the Freikorps.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=146}}\n\nIn March 1920, a group of [[right-wing]] [[militarists]] led by [[Wolfgang Kapp]] and former German military chief-of-staff Erich Ludendorff initiated a briefly successful [[putsch]] against the German government in what became known as the [[Kapp Putsch]], but the putsch ultimately failed and the government was restored.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=146}}\n\n[[File:Noe Zhordania meets 2nd International delegation. 1920.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Noe Zhordania]] (man with white beard and wearing a white hat on the left side of the car), [[Prime Minister of Georgia|prime minister]] of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|newly independent Georgia]], attending a meeting of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] in 1920]]\nAfter World War I, several attempts were made at a global level to refound the Second International that collapsed amidst national divisions in the war.

Upon confirmation, Bronsky did not return to the meeting.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=425}}\n\nThe overall response from the Vienna International was divided. The Mensheviks demanded that the Vienna International immediately condemn Russia's aggression against Georgia, but the majority as represented by German delegate Alfred Henke sought to exercise caution and said that the delegates should wait for confirmation.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=509}} Russia's invasion of Georgia completely violated the non-aggression treaty signed between Lenin and Zhordania as well as violating Georgia's sovereignty by annexing Georgia directly into the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]]. Tensions between Bolsheviks and social democrats worsened with the [[Kronstadt rebellion]].{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=425}} This was caused by unrest among leftists against the Bolshevik government in Russia. Russian social democrats distributed leaflets calling for a general strike against the Bolshevik regime and the Bolsheviks responded by forcefully repressing the rebels.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=434}}\n\nRelations between the social democratic movement and Bolshevik Russia descended into complete antagonism in response to the [[Russian famine of 1921]] and the Bolsheviks' violent repression of opposition to their government. Multiple social democratic parties were disgusted with Russia's Bolshevik regime, particularly Germany's SPD and the Netherlands' [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (SDAP) that denounced the Bolsheviks for defiling socialism and declared that the Bolsheviks had \"driven out the best of our comrades, thrown them into prison and put them to death\".{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=441}}\n\nIn May 1923, social democrats united to found their own international, the [[Labour and Socialist International]] (LSI), founded in Hamburg, Germany. The LSI declared that all its affiliated political parties would retain autonomy to make their own decisions regarding internal affairs of their countries, but that international affairs would be addressed by the LSI.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=509}} The LSI addressed the issue of the rise of [[fascism]] by declaring the LSI to be [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]].{{sfn|Ceplair|1987|p=78}}\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 between the democratically elected [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] government versus the authoritarian right-wing [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] led by [[Francisco Franco]] with the support of [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], the Executive Committee of the LSI declared not only its support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]], but also that it supported the Spanish government having the right to purchase arms to fight Franco's Nationalist forces.

Furthermore, social democratic parties declared that the Great Depression demonstrated the need for substantial macroeconomic planning by the state while their free market opponents staunchly opposed this.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=111}} However, attempts by social democratic governments to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the ensuing political instability in their countries caused by the depression. For instance, the British Labour Party became internally split over said policies while Germany's SPD government did not have the time to implement such policies as Germany's politics degenerated into violent civil unrest pitting the left against the right in which the [[Nazi Party]] rose to power in January 1933 and violently dismantled parliamentary democracy for the next twenty-two years.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=102}}\n\nA major development for social democracy was the victory of several social democratic parties in Scandinavia, particularly the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] (SAP) in the [[1920 Swedish general election]].{{sfn|Sejersted|2011|p=180}} The SAP was elected to a [[minority government]].

In the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]], the Labour Party won a plurality of seats and was elected as a minority government, but required assistance from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to achieve a majority in parliament. Opponents of the Labour Party falsely accused the party of Bolshevik sympathies. Prime Minister MacDonald responded to these allegations by stressing the party's commitment to reformist gradualism and openly opposing the radical wing in the party.{{sfn|Morgan|2006|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nMacDonald emphasized that the Labour minority government's first and foremost commitment was to uphold democratic and responsible government over all other policies. MacDonald emphasized this because he knew that any attempt to pass major socialist legislation in a minority government would endanger the new government as it would be opposed and blocked by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the Liberals, who together held a majority of seats. The Labour Party had risen to power in the aftermath of Britain's severe recession of 1921\u20131922.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\nWith the economy beginning to recover, British trade unions demanded that their wages be restored from the cuts they took in the recession. The trade unions soon became deeply dissatisfied with the MacDonald government and labour unrest and threat of strikes arose in transportation sector, including docks and railways. MacDonald viewed the situation as a crisis, consulting the unions in advance to warn them that his government would have to use strikebreakers if the situation continued. The anticipated clash between the government and the unions was averted, but the situation alienated the unions from the MacDonald government, whose most controversial action was having Britain recognize the Soviet Union in February 1924. The British conservative tabloid press, including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', used this to promote a [[red scare]] by claiming that the Labour government's recognition of the Soviet Union proved that Labour held pro-Bolshevik sympathies.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\nThe Labour Party lost the 1924 general election and a Conservative government was elected. Although MacDonald faced multiple challenges to his leadership of the party, the Labour Party stabilized as a capable opposition to the Conservative government by 1927. MacDonald released a new political programme for the party titled ''Labour and the Nation'' (1928). The Labour Party returned to government in 1929, but it soon had to deal with the economic catastrophe of the stock market crash of 1929.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\n[[File:Rudolf Hilferding and Gattin, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rudolf Hilferding]], a major figure and policymaker in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and the Czechoslovak [[Sopade]]]]\nIn the 1920s, SPD policymaker and Marxist [[Rudolf Hilferding]] proposed substantial policy changes in the SPD as well as influencing social democratic and socialist theory.

Organized capitalism was based upon [[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]] and [[cartel]]s controlled by financial institutions that could no longer make profit within their countries' national boundaries and therefore needed to export to survive, resulting in support for imperialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=56}}\n\nHilferding described that while early capitalism promoted itself as peaceful and based on free trade, the era of organized capitalism was aggressive and said that \"in the place of humanity there came the idea of the strength and power of the state\". He said that this had the consequence of creating effective collectivization within capitalism and had prepared the way for socialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nOriginally, Hilferding's vision of a socialism replacing organized capitalism was highly Kautskyan in assuming an either/or perspective and expecting a catastrophic clash between organized capitalism versus socialism. By the 1920s, Hilferding became an adherent to promoting a gradualist evolution of capitalism into socialism. He then praised organised capitalism for being a step towards socialism, saying at the SPD congress in 1927 that organised capitalism is nothing less than \"the replacement of the capitalist principle of free competition by the socialist principle of planned production\". He went on to say that \"the problem is posed to our generation: with the help of the state, with the help of conscious social direction, to transform the economy organized and led by capitalists into an economy directed by the democratic state\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nIn the 1930s, the SPD began to transition away from revisionist Marxism towards liberal socialism beginning in the 1930s.

Whereas the 1921\u20131923 SAP governments had run large deficits, the new SAP government reduced Sweden's budget deficit after a strong increase in state expenditure in 1933 and the resulting economic recovery. The government had planned to eliminate Sweden's budget deficit in seven years, but it took only three years to eliminate the deficit and Sweden had a budget surplus from 1936 to 1938.

Political violence in Mexico escalated in the 1920s after the outbreak of the [[Cristero War]] in which far-right reactionary clerics staged a violent insurgency against the left-wing government that was attempting to institute [[secularization]] in Mexico.{{sfn|Hart|1986|p=13}}\n\nCardenas' government also openly supported Spain's Republican government while opposing Francisco Franco's Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War.

Others such as French political scientist [[Pierre Manent]] emphasized the need for social democrats to rehabilitate and reinvigorate the idea of nationhood.{{sfn|Angier|2017}}\n\nIn a 2017 article in ''[[The Political Quarterly]]'', J\u00f6rg Michael Dostal explains the decline in Germany with electoral disillusionment with [[Third Way]] and [[neoliberal]] policies, or more specifically [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]'s embrace of the [[Hartz reforms]] which recommended the privatization and reduction of the welfare state as well as the deregulation of the labour market and curtailing of workers rights. According to Dostal, the SPD subsequently lost half of its former electoral coalition (i.e. blue-collar voters and socially disadvantaged groups) while efforts to attract centrist and middle-class voters failed to produce any compensating gains. Furthermore, the article concludes that the only possible remedy is for the SPD to make efforts to regain former voters by abandoning neoliberalism and offering credible social welfare and redistributive policies.{{sfn|Dostal|2016|pp=230\u2013240}} A research article in ''[[Socio-Economic Review]]'' found that the longer-term electoral effects of the Hartz plan and [[Agenda 2010]] on relevant voter groups were limited, but that it had helped to entrench [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] as a permanent political force to the left of the SPD.{{sfn|Manow|Schwander|2016|pp=117\u2013134}}\n\nAfter the Norwegian [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]'s surprising loss in the [[2017 Norwegian parliamentary election|2017 parliamentary election]], commentators such as the editor of ''[[Avisenes Nyhetsbyr\u00e5]]'' highlighted that the party had ignored a strong surge in discontent with [[mass immigration]] among potential voters.{{sfnm|1a1=Goffeng|1y=2017|2a1=Arnste|2y=2017|3a1=Hoel|3y=2017}} [[Hanne Skartveit]] of ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' later claimed that social democrats have been struggling because the sustainability of the welfare state is challenged by mass immigration. Skarstein emphasized the contrast between social democrats' strong commitment for helping people on the international scene on one side and their strong commitment in favour of welfare policies for the nation's own population on the other.{{sfn|Aune|Myklebust|2018}}\n\nSpain is one of the countries in which the [[PSOE]], the main social democratic party, has been governing for a longer period of time than any other party since the transition to democracy in 1977. However, it has also declined like the European social democratic parties, losing half of its electorate between 2010 and 2015 to Podemos and gaining its worst ever result in the 2015 general election since the restoration of democracy in Spain. Despite this loss, the PSOE returned to power in June 2018 after the government of [[Mariano Rajoy]] was ousted in a vote of no confidence in the aftermath of a corruption scandal, with [[Pedro S\u00e1nchez (politician)|Pedro S\u00e1nchez]] leading the party.

Those policies were dubbed as [[State Socialism (Germany)|State Socialism]] by the [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] opposition, but the term was later accepted and re-appropriated by Bismarck.{{sfn|Feuchtwanger|2002|p=221}} It was a set of social programs implemented in Germany that were initiated by Bismarck in 1883 as remedial measures to appease the [[working class]] and reduce support for [[socialism]] and the Social Democrats following earlier attempts to achieve the same objective through Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Laws.{{sfnm|1a1=Bismarck|1y=1884|2a1=Gregory|2a2=Stuart|2y=2003|2p=207|2ps=: \"Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced social welfare legislation in Germany between 1883 and 1888, despite violent political opposition, as a direct attempt to stave off Marx's (prediction of a) socialist revolution.\"}} This did not prevent the Social Democrats to become the biggest party in parliament by 1912.{{sfn|Boissoneault|2017|ps=: \"All told, Bismarck's system was a massive success\u2014except in one respect.

states}}\nSocial democracy is criticized by other socialists because it serves to devise new means to strengthen the capitalist system which conflicts with the socialist goal of replacing capitalism with a socialist system.{{sfn|Clarke|1981|p=2}} According to this view, social democracy fails to address the systemic issues inherent in capitalism. The American democratic socialist philosopher [[David Schweickart]] contrasts social democracy with [[democratic socialism]] by defining the former as an attempt to strengthen the [[welfare state]] and the latter as an alternative economic system to capitalism. According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently humanised and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. He gives the example that attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation and too much job security would erode labour discipline.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=447|ps=: \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labor movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanized and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere (e.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labor discipline breaks down.)\"}} In contrast to social democracy's [[mixed economy]], democratic socialists advocate a [[post-capitalist]] economic system based on either a [[Market economy#Market socialism|market economy]] combined with [[workers' self-management]], or on some form of [[Participatory economy|participatory]], [[decentralized planning]] of the economy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=448|ps=: \"Some have endorsed the concept of market socialism, a postcapitalist economy that retains market competition but socializes the means of production and, in some versions, extends democracy to the workplace. Some hold out for a nonmarket, participatory economy. All democratic socialists agree on the need for a democratic alternative to capitalism.\"}}\n\n[[Marxian economics|Marxian]] socialists argue that social democratic welfare policies cannot resolve the fundamental structural issues of capitalism such as [[Business cycle#Marxian economics|cyclical fluctuations]], [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploitation]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]. Accordingly, social democratic programs intended to ameliorate living conditions in capitalism\u2014such as unemployment benefits and taxation on profits\u2014creates further contradictions by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system by reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.{{sfn|Ticktin|1998|pp=60\u201361|ps=: \"The Marxist answers that [...] it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the reserve army of labour, taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion).\"}} The welfare state only serves to legitimize and prolong the exploitative and contradiction-laden system of capitalism to society's detriment. Critics of contemporary social democracy such as Jonas Hinnfors argue that when social democracy abandoned [[Marxism]] it also abandoned socialism and became a liberal capitalist movement, effectively making social democrats similar to non-socialist parties like the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the United States.{{sfn|Hinnfors|2006|pp=117, 137\u2013139}}\n\n[[Market socialism]] is also critical of social democratic welfare states. While one common goal of both concepts is to achieve greater social and economic equality, market socialism does so by changes in enterprise ownership and management whereas social democracy attempts to do so by subsidies and taxes on privately owned enterprises to finance welfare programs. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt III]] (grandson of United States president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]) and David Belkin criticize social democracy for maintaining a [[Property income|property-owning capitalist class]] which has an active interest in reversing social democratic welfare policies and a disproportionate amount of power as a class to influence government policy.{{sfn|Weisskopf|1994|pp=314\u2013315|ps=: \"Social democracy achieves greater egalitarianism via ''ex post'' government taxes and subsidies, where market socialism does so via ''ex ante'' changes in patterns of enterprise ownership [...] the maintenance of property-owning capitalists under social democracy assures the presence of a disproportionately powerful class with a continuing interest in challenging social democratic government policies.\"}} The economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] point out that social democracy requires a strong [[labour movement]] to sustain its heavy redistribution through taxes and that it is idealistic to think such redistribution can be accomplished in other countries with weaker labour movements, noting that social democracy in Scandinavian countries has been in decline as the labour movement weakened.{{sfn|Bardhan|Roemer|1992|p=104|ps=: \"Since it permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labour movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now.\"}}\n\nSome critics claim that social democracy abandoned socialism in the 1930s by endorsing Keynesian [[welfare capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wright|1y=1999|1pp=91|2a1=Fitzpatrick|2y=2003|2pp=2\u20133}} The democratic socialist political theorist [[Michael Harrington]] argues that social democracy historically supported [[Keynesianism]] as part of a \"social democratic compromise\" between capitalism and socialism. This compromise created welfare states and Harrington contends that although this compromise did not allow for the immediate creation of socialism, it \"recognized noncapitalist, and even anticapitalist, principles of human need over and above the imperatives of profit\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=93}} More recently, social democrats in favour of the [[Third Way]] have been accused of having endorsed capitalism, including by anti-Third Way social democrats who have accused Third Way proponents such as [[Anthony Giddens]] of being anti-social democratic and anti-socialist in practice.{{sfn|Cammack|2004|p=155}}\n\nSocial democracy's reformism has been criticized from both the left and right,{{sfnm|1a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain|1y=2002|2a1=Patnaik|2y=2010|2pp=3\u201321|3a1=Nagin|3y=2018}} for if the left was to govern a capitalist economy, it would have to do so according to capitalist, not socialist, logic. This argument was previously echoed by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942), writing: \"Socialists had to govern in an essentially capitalist world [...], a social and economic system that would not function except on capitalist lines. [...] If they were to run it, they would have to run it according to its own logic. They would have to \"administer\" capitalism\".{{sfn|Romano|2006|p=114}} Similarly, [[Irving Kristol]] argued: \"Democratic socialism turns out to be an inherently unstable compound, a contradiction in terms. Every social-democratic party, once in power, soon finds itself choosing, at one point after another, between the socialist society it aspires to and the liberal society that lathered it\".{{sfn|Barrett|1978}} [[Joseph Stalin]] was a vocal critic of reformist social democracy, later coining the term [[social fascism]] to describe social democracy in the 1930s because in this period social democracy embraced a similar [[Corporatism|corporatist economic model]] to the model supported by [[fascism]]. This view was adopted by the [[Communist International]]. It was argued that capitalist society had entered the [[Third Period]] in which a [[proletarian revolution]] was imminent, but it could be prevented by social democrats and other fascist forces.{{sfn|Haro|2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[International Group of Democratic Socialists]]\n* [[List of anti-capitalist and communist parties with national parliamentary representation]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties that have governed]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties and organizations]]\n* [[List of democratic socialists]]\n* [[List of social democratic parties]]\n* [[List of social democrats]]\n* [[Socialist Party]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n==== Books ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book|last=Abjorensen|first=Norman|year=2019|title=Historical Dictionary of Democracy|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781538120743|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1993|title=Political Ideology Today|series=Politics Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978071903346-9|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=2001|title=Political Ideology Today|edition=2nd|series=Politics Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719060199|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|editor1-last=Aggarwal|editor1-first=J.

Meanwhile, democratic socialism in Sweden provided an alternative model. Its sustained economic development and extensive welfare programs fascinated many. Numerous scholars within the democratic socialist camp argue that China should model itself politically and economically on Sweden, which is viewed as more genuinely socialist than China. There is a growing consensus among them that in the Nordic countries the welfare state has been extraordinarily successful in eliminating poverty.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Lowe|first=Rodney|date=12 April 1993|title=The Welfare State in Britain Since 1945|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=9781403911933|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|editor-last1=Ludlam|editor-first1=Steve|editor-last2=Smith|editor-first2=Martin J.|date=7 October 2017|title=Governing as New Labour: Policy and Politics Under Blair|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=9781403906786|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Luxemburg|first=Rosa|year=1900|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/|title=Reform or Revolution|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Macfarlane|first=Leslie|year=1996|chapter=Socialism and Common Ownership: An Historical Perspective|editor1-last=King|editor1-first=Preston|title=Socialism and the Common Good: New Fabian Essays|location=London|publisher=Frank Cass|pages=17\u201362|isbn=9780714646558|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Mander|first=Jerry|date=2012|title=The Capitalism Papers: Fatal Flaws of an Obsolete System|url=https://archive.org/details/capitalismpapers0000mand/page/213|publisher=Counterpoint|pages=213\u2013217|isbn=9781582437170|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last1=Marglin|first1=Stephen A.|last2=Schor|first2=Juliet B.|year=1991|title=The Golden Age of Capitalism: Reinterpreting the Postwar Experience|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780198287414|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198287414.001.0001|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last1=Marglin|first1=Stephen A.|last2=Schor|first2=Juliet B.|date=21 August 2017|title=Reflecting on Seventy Years of Development Policy Analysis|chapter=Post-war reconstruction and development in the Golden Age of Capitalism|work=World Economic and Social Survey 2017|series=World Economic and Social Survey|publisher=United Nations iLibrary|doi=10.18356/8310f38c-en|isbn=9789210605984|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|year=1972|editor-last=Padover|editor-first=Saul K.|editor-link=Saul K.

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

[[Economic interventionism|economic]] and [[Social interventionism|social interventions]] to promote [[social justice]] within the framework of a [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] [[polity]] and a [[capitalist]]-oriented [[mixed economy]]. The protocols and norms used to accomplish this involve a commitment to [[Representative democracy|representative]] and [[participatory democracy]], measures for [[income redistribution]], [[Regulatory economics|regulation of the economy]] in the [[Common good|general interest]] and [[social welfare]] provisions.{{sfn|Miller|1998|p=827}}{{sfn|Badie|Berg-Schlosser|Morlino|2011|p=2423|ps=: \"Social democracy refers to a political tendency resting on three fundamental features: (1) democracy (e.g., equal rights to vote and form parties), (2) an economy partly regulated by the state (e.g., through Keynesianism), and (3) a welfare state offering social support to those in need (e.g., equal rights to education, health service, employment and pensions).\"}}{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=128|ps=: \"Social democracy is an ideological stance that supports a broad balance between market capitalism, on the one hand, and state intervention, on the other hand. Being based on a compromise between the market and the state, social democracy lacks a systematic underlying theory and is, arguably, inherently vague. It is nevertheless associated with the following views: (1) capitalism is the only reliable means of generating wealth, but it is a morally defective means of distributing wealth because of its tendency towards poverty and inequality; (2) the defects of the capitalist system can be rectified through economic and social intervention, the state being the custodian of the public interest [...].\"}} Due to longstanding governance by [[Social Democratic Party|social democratic parties]] during the [[post-war consensus]] and their influence on [[socioeconomic]] policy in the [[Nordic countries]], social democracy has become associated with the [[Nordic model]] and [[Keynesianism]] within political circles in the late 20th century.{{sfn|Gombert|2009|p=8}}{{sfn|Sejersted|2011}} It has also been seen by some political commentators as a synonym for modern socialism{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|p=100}}{{sfn|Pruitt|2019|ps=: \"Social democracy, the most common form of modern socialism, focuses on achieving social reforms and redistribution of wealth through democratic processes, and can co-exist alongside a free-market capitalist economy.\"}}{{sfn|Berman|2020|ps=: \"Social democracy is a variant of socialism distinguished by a conviction that democracy makes it both possible and desirable to take advantage of capitalism's upsides while addressing its downsides by regulating markets and implementing social policies that insulate citizens from those markets' most destabilizing and destructive consequences.\"}} and as overlapping with [[democratic socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=1985|1p=289|2a1=Foley|2y=1994|2p=23|3a1=Eatwell|3a2=Wright|3y=1999|3p=80|3ps=: \"So too with 'democratic socialism', a term coined by its adherents as an act of disassociation from the twentieth-century realities of undemocratic socialism (an illegitimate, indeed impossible, coupling in terms of classical doctrine, including Marxist doctrine) [...].\"|4a1=Busky|4y=2000|4p=8|4ps=: \"Social democracy is a somewhat controversial term among democratic socialists.

Unlike Marx and Engels' ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'', Lassalle promoted class struggle in a more moderate form.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} While [[Marx's theory of the state]] saw it negatively as an instrument of [[Ruling class|class rule]] that should only exist temporarily upon the rise to power of the [[proletariat]] and then dismantled, Lassalle accepted the state. Lassalle viewed the state as a means through which workers could enhance their interests and even transform the society to create an economy based on [[Worker cooperative|worker-run cooperatives]]. Lassalle's strategy was primarily electoral and reformist, with [[Lassallism|Lassalleans]] contending that the working class needed a political party that fought above all for universal adult male suffrage.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=284}}\n\n[[File:Social-democracy-before-ww2.svg|thumb|A timeline showing the development of [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|social democracy in Germany]] before World War II]]\nThe ADAV's party newspaper was called ''The Social Democrat'' ({{lang-de|Der Sozialdemokrat}}). Marx and Engels responded to the title ''Sozialdemocrat'' with distaste and Engels once writing: \"But what a title: ''Sozialdemokrat''! [...] Why do they not call the thing simply ''The Proletarian''\". Marx agreed with Engels that ''Sozialdemokrat'' was a bad title.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} Although the origins of the name ''Sozialdemokrat'' actually traced back to Marx's German translation in 1848 of the [[The Mountain (1849)|Democratic Socialist Party]] ({{lang-fr|Partie Democrat-Socialist}}) into the Party of Social Democracy ({{lang-de|link=no|Partei der Sozialdemokratie}}), Marx did not like this French party because he viewed it as dominated by the [[middle class]] and associated the word ''Sozialdemokrat'' with that party.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}} There was a Marxist faction within the ADAV represented by [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], who became one of the editors of the ''Der Sozialdemokrat''.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} While democrats looked to the Revolutions of 1848 as a [[democratic revolution]] which in the long run ensured [[liberty, equality and fraternity]], Marxists denounced 1848 as a betrayal of working-class ideals by a [[bourgeoisie]] indifferent to the legitimate demands of the proletariat.{{sfn|Gildea|2000|pp=207\u2013235}}\n\nFaced with opposition from liberal capitalists to his socialist policies, Lassalle controversially attempted to forge a tactical alliance with the [[Conservatism in Germany|conservative]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] [[Junkers]] due to their communitarian anti-bourgeois attitudes as well as with Prussian Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=284}} Friction in the ADAV arose over Lassalle's policy of a friendly approach to Bismarck that had incorrectly presumed that Bismarck would in turn be friendly towards them. This approach was opposed by the party's faction associated with Marx and Engels, including Liebknecht.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}} Opposition in the ADAV to Lassalle's friendly approach to Bismarck's government resulted in Liebknecht resigning from his position as editor of ''Die Sozialdemokrat'' and leaving the ADAV in 1865. In 1869, [[August Bebel]] and Liebknecht founded the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] (SDAP) as a merger of the [[petty-bourgeois]] [[Saxon People's Party]] (SVP), a faction of the ADAV and members of the League of German Workers' Associations (VDA).{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}}\n\nAlthough the SDAP was not officially Marxist, it was the first major working-class organization to be led by Marxists and both Marx and Engels had direct association with the party. The party adopted stances similar to those adopted by Marx at the First International. There was intense rivalry and antagonism between the SDAP and the ADAV, with the SDAP being highly hostile to the Prussian government while the ADAV pursued a reformist and more cooperative approach.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=285\u2013286}} This rivalry reached its height involving the two parties' stances on the [[Franco-Prussian War]], with the SDAP refusing to support Prussia's war effort by claiming it was an [[imperialist]] war pursued by Bismarck while the ADAV supported the war as a defensive one because it saw Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and France as an \"overreacting aggressor\".{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=285\u2013286}}{{sfn|Schmidt|2018|p=102}}\n\n[[File:Barricade18March1871.jpg|thumb|left|A Parisian barricade set up by revolutionary forces of the [[Paris Commune]] in March 1871]]\nIn the aftermath of the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, revolution broke out in France, with revolutionary army members along with working-class revolutionaries founding the [[Paris Commune]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=219}} The Paris Commune appealed both to the citizens of Paris regardless of class as well as to the working class, a major base of support for the government, via militant rhetoric. In spite of such militant rhetoric to appeal to the working class, the Paris Commune received substantial support from the middle-class bourgeoisie of Paris, including shopkeepers and merchants. In part due to its sizeable number neo-[[Proudhonian]]s and [[neo-Jacobin]]s in the Central Committee, the Paris Commune declared that it was not opposed to private property, but that it rather hoped to create the widest distribution of it.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=225}} The political composition of the Paris Commune included twenty-five neo-Jacobins, fifteen to twenty neo-Proudhonians and proto-[[syndicalists]], nine or ten Blanquists, a variety of [[Radicalism (historical)#France|radical republicans]] and a few members of the First International influenced by Marx.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=229}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the Paris Commune's collapse in 1871, Marx praised it in his work ''[[The Civil War in France]]'' (1871) for its achievements in spite of its pro-bourgeois influences and called it an excellent model of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in practice as it had dismantled the apparatus of the bourgeois state, including its huge bureaucracy, military and executive, judicial and legislative institutions, replacing it with a working-class state with broad popular support.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=256}} The Paris Commune's collapse and the persecution of its [[anarchist]] supporters had the effect of weakening the influence of the [[Bakuninist]] anarchists in the First International which resulted in Marx expelling the weakened rival Bakuninists from the International a year later.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=256}} In Britain, the achievement of the legalization of trade unions under the [[Trade Union Act 1871]] drew British trade unionists to believe that working conditions could be improved through parliamentary means.{{sfn|Ishay|2008|p=149}}\n\nAt the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]] of 1872, Marx made a remark in which he admitted that while there are countries \"where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means\", in most European countries \"the lever of our revolution must be force\", arguing:{{sfn|Gray|Johnson|Walker|2014|pp=119\u2013120}} {{quote|You know that the institutions, mores, and traditions of various countries must be taken into consideration, and we do not deny that there are countries\u2014such as America, England, and if I were more familiar with your institutions, I would perhaps also add Holland\u2014where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means.

In his work ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', Marx himself later in his life acknowledged that the middle class was not disappearing, but his acknowledgement of this error is not well known due to the popularity of ''The Communist Manifesto'' and the relative obscurity of ''Theories of Surplus Value''.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|pp=249\u2013250}}\n\n[[File:Bernstein Eduard 1895.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Eduard Bernstein]], a notable [[Marxist revisionist]] who supported [[reformism]] and [[liberal democracy]]]]\nBernstein criticized Marxism's concept of \"irreconciliable class conflicts\" and Marxism's hostility to [[liberalism]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} He challenged Marx's position on liberalism by claiming that [[Liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and social democrats held common grounds that he claimed could be utilized to create a socialist republic.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} He believed that economic class disparities between the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[proletariat]] would gradually be eliminated through legal reforms and economic redistribution programs.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} Bernstein rejected the Marxian principle of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], claiming that gradualist democratic reforms would improve the rights of the [[working class]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=141}}\n\nAccording to Bernstein, social democracy did not seek to create a socialism separate from bourgeois society, but it instead sought to create a common development based on Western [[humanism]].{{sfn|Wright|1999|p=86}} The development of socialism under social democracy does not seek to rupture existing society and its cultural traditions, but to act as an enterprise of extension and growth.{{sfn|Wright|1999|p=88}} Furthermore, he believed that class cooperation was a preferable course to achieve socialism, rather than class conflict.{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=2}}\n\nBernstein responded to critics that he was not destroying Marxism and instead claimed he was modernizing it as it was required \"to separate the vital parts of Marx's theory from its outdated accessories\". He asserted his support for the Marxian conception of a \"scientifically based\" socialist movement and said that such a movement's goals must be determined in accordance with \"knowledge capable of objective proof, that is, knowledge which refers to, and conforms with, nothing but empirical knowledge and logic\".{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=96}}\n\nBernstein was also strongly opposed to [[dogmatism]] within the Marxist movement. Despite embracing a [[mixed economy]], Bernstein was skeptical and critical of [[welfare state]] policies, believing them to be helpful, but ultimately secondary to the main social democratic goal of replacing capitalism with socialism, fearing that state aid to the unemployed might lead to the sanctioning of a new form of [[pauperism]].{{sfn|Jackson|2008|ps=: \"Bernstein was also cautious about the use of social spending to ameliorate capitalism; he ranked what would later be called the 'welfare state' as a helpful intervention, but ultimately secondary to more decisive policies intended to attack the source of poverty and inequality.

Luxemburg likened Bernstein's policies to that of the dispute between Marxists and the opportunistic ''Praktiker'' (\"pragmatists\"). She denounced Bernstein's evolutionary socialism for being a \"petty-bourgeois vulgarization of Marxism\" and claimed that Bernstein's years of exile in Britain had made him lose familiarity with the situation in Germany, where he was promoting evolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}} Luxemburg sought to maintain social democracy as a revolutionary Marxist creed, writing: {{quote|[T]here could be no socialism\u2014at least in Germany\u2014outside of Marxist socialism, and there could be no socialist class struggle outside of social democracy.

Russian Marxist [[George Plekhanov]] joined Kautsky and Luxemburg in condemning Bernstein for having a neo-Kantian philosophy.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=96}} Kautsky and Luxemburg contended that Bernstein's empiricist viewpoints depersonalized and dehistoricized the social observer and reducing objects down to facts. Luxemburg associated Bernstein with [[Ethical socialism|ethical socialists]] who she identified as being associated with the bourgeoisie and Kantian liberalism.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=115}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist reformists and revolutionaries in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist measures while maintaining his belief that revolutionary seizure of power by the proletariat should remain a goal. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the revisionists.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=182}}\n\nEngels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he stated that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us socialists all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Engels also said that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power that he predicted could bring \"social democracy into power as early as 1898\".{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Engels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}}\n\nEngels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and Kautsky in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism. While highlighting ''The Communist Manifesto'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\",{{sfn|Engels|Marx|1848|p=52}} Engels also wrote to Kautsky the following on 1 April 1895, four months before his death: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality ''quand m\u00eame''.{{efn|''Quand m\u00eame'' literally means \"come what may\", but it is better translated as \"at all costs\".}} Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its entirety in the ''Neue Zeit'' in order that this disgraceful impression may be erased. I shall leave Liebknecht in no doubt as to what I think about it and the same applies to those who, irrespective of who they may be, gave him this opportunity of perverting my views and, what's more, without so much as a word to me about it.{{sfn|Engels|2004|p=86}}</blockquote>\n\nAfter delivering a lecture in Britain to the Fabian Society titled \"On What Marx Really Taught\" in 1897, Bernstein wrote a letter to the orthodox Marxist [[August Bebel]] in which he revealed that he felt conflicted with what he had said at the lecture as well as revealing his intentions regarding revision of Marxism, arguing: {{quote|[A]s I was reading the lecture, the thought shot through my head that I was doing Marx an injustice, that it was not Marx I was presenting. [...] I told myself secretly that this could not go on. It is idle to reconcile the irreconcilable. The vital thing is to be clear as to where Marx is still right and where he is not.{{sfn|Bernstein|2004|p=xix}}}}\n\nWhat Bernstein meant was that he believed that Marx was wrong in assuming that the capitalist economy would collapse as a result of its internal contradictions as by the mid-1890s there was little evidence of such internal contradictions causing this to capitalism.{{sfn|Bernstein|2004|p=xix}}\n\n[[File:Jean-Jaur\u00e8s01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]], a pacifist socialist and one of the historical leaders of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]]]]\nThe dispute over policies in favour of reform or revolution dominated discussions at the 1899 Hanover Party Conference of the [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|Socialist Workers' Party of Germany]] (SAPD). This issue had become especially prominent with the Millerand affair in France in which [[Alexandre Millerand]] of the [[Independent Socialists (France)|Independent Socialists]] joined the non-socialist and liberal government of Prime Minister Waldeck-Rousseau without seeking support from his party's leadership.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}} Millerand's actions provoked outrage amongst revolutionary socialists within the Second International, including the anarchist left and [[Jules Guesde]]'s revolutionary Marxists.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}}\n\nIn response to these disputes over reform or revolution, the 1900 Paris Congress of the Second International declared a resolution to the dispute in which Guesde's demands were partially accepted in a resolution drafted by Kautsky that declared that overall socialists should not take part in a non-socialist government, but he provided exceptions to this rule where necessary to provide the \"protection of the achievements of the working class\".{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}}\n\nAnother prominent figure who influenced social democracy was French revisionist Marxist and reformist socialist [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]]. During the 1904 Congress of the [[Second International]], Jaur\u00e8s challenged orthodox Marxist August Bebel, the mentor of Kautsky, over his promotion of monolithic socialist tactics. He claimed that no coherent socialist platform could be equally applicable to different countries and regions due to different political systems in them, noting that Bebel's homeland of Germany at the time was very authoritarian and had limited parliamentary democracy.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=47}}\n\nJaur\u00e8s compared the limited political influence of socialism in government in Germany to the substantial influence that socialism had gained in France due to its stronger parliamentary democracy. He claimed that the example of the political differences between Germany and France demonstrated that monolithic socialist tactics were impossible, given the political differences of various countries.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=47}}\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Australian Labor Party]] formed the world's first labour party government as well as the world's first social democratic government at a national level in 1910.

After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 in Russia (not to be confused with the [[October Revolution]]) in which the Tsarist regime in Russia was overthrown, MacDonald visited the [[Russian Provisional Government]] in June 1917, seeking to persuade Russia to oppose the war and seek peace.

The strikers demanded bread, freedom, peace and the formation of [[workers' council]]s as was being done in Russia. Amidst the German public's uproar, the SPD alongside the [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressives]] and the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic]] labour movement in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] put forward the [[Reichstag Peace Resolution|Peace Resolution]] on 19 July 1917 that called for a compromise peace to end the war which was passed by a majority of members of the Reichstag.{{sfn|Chickering|p=155}}\n\nThe German High Command opposed the Peace Resolution, but it did seek to end the war with Russia and presented the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] to the [[Bolshevik government]] in 1918 that agreed to the terms and the Reichstag passed the treaty which included the support of the SPD, the Progressives and the Catholic political movement.{{sfn|Chickering|p=155}}\n\nBy late 1918, the war situation for Germany had become hopeless and [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] was pressured to make peace. Wilhelm II appointed a new cabinet that included SPD members. At the same time, the Imperial Naval Command was determined to make a heroic last stand against the British [[Royal Navy]].

The situation soon went completely out of control when the recruited Freikorps went on a violent rampage against workers and murdered the communist leaders [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. The atrocities by the government-recruited Freikorps against the communist revolutionaries badly tarnished the reputation of the SPD and strengthened the confidence of reactionary forces.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nIn spite of this, the SPD was able to win the largest number of seats in the [[1919 German federal election|parliamentary election held on 19 January 1919]] and Ebert was elected [[president of Germany]].

MacDonald viewed the situation as a crisis, consulting the unions in advance to warn them that his government would have to use strikebreakers if the situation continued. The anticipated clash between the government and the unions was averted, but the situation alienated the unions from the MacDonald government, whose most controversial action was having Britain recognize the Soviet Union in February 1924. The British conservative tabloid press, including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', used this to promote a [[red scare]] by claiming that the Labour government's recognition of the Soviet Union proved that Labour held pro-Bolshevik sympathies.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\nThe Labour Party lost the 1924 general election and a Conservative government was elected. Although MacDonald faced multiple challenges to his leadership of the party, the Labour Party stabilized as a capable opposition to the Conservative government by 1927. MacDonald released a new political programme for the party titled ''Labour and the Nation'' (1928). The Labour Party returned to government in 1929, but it soon had to deal with the economic catastrophe of the stock market crash of 1929.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\n[[File:Rudolf Hilferding and Gattin, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rudolf Hilferding]], a major figure and policymaker in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and the Czechoslovak [[Sopade]]]]\nIn the 1920s, SPD policymaker and Marxist [[Rudolf Hilferding]] proposed substantial policy changes in the SPD as well as influencing social democratic and socialist theory.

Organized capitalism was based upon [[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]] and [[cartel]]s controlled by financial institutions that could no longer make profit within their countries' national boundaries and therefore needed to export to survive, resulting in support for imperialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=56}}\n\nHilferding described that while early capitalism promoted itself as peaceful and based on free trade, the era of organized capitalism was aggressive and said that \"in the place of humanity there came the idea of the strength and power of the state\". He said that this had the consequence of creating effective collectivization within capitalism and had prepared the way for socialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nOriginally, Hilferding's vision of a socialism replacing organized capitalism was highly Kautskyan in assuming an either/or perspective and expecting a catastrophic clash between organized capitalism versus socialism. By the 1920s, Hilferding became an adherent to promoting a gradualist evolution of capitalism into socialism. He then praised organised capitalism for being a step towards socialism, saying at the SPD congress in 1927 that organised capitalism is nothing less than \"the replacement of the capitalist principle of free competition by the socialist principle of planned production\". He went on to say that \"the problem is posed to our generation: with the help of the state, with the help of conscious social direction, to transform the economy organized and led by capitalists into an economy directed by the democratic state\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nIn the 1930s, the SPD began to transition away from revisionist Marxism towards liberal socialism beginning in the 1930s. After the party was banned by the Nazis in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through [[Sopade]].{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.

Whereas the 1921\u20131923 SAP governments had run large deficits, the new SAP government reduced Sweden's budget deficit after a strong increase in state expenditure in 1933 and the resulting economic recovery. The government had planned to eliminate Sweden's budget deficit in seven years, but it took only three years to eliminate the deficit and Sweden had a budget surplus from 1936 to 1938.

However, some within the party were displeased about the changing focus of the party, most notably [[John A.

Economists [[Pranab Bardhan]] and [[John Roemer]] argue that Soviet-type economies failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of state enterprises in their administrative, command allocation of resources and commodities and the lack of democracy in the political systems that the Soviet-type economies were combined with.

According to Dostal, the SPD subsequently lost half of its former electoral coalition (i.e. blue-collar voters and socially disadvantaged groups) while efforts to attract centrist and middle-class voters failed to produce any compensating gains.

with a socialist system.{{sfn|Clarke|1981|p=2}} According to this view, social democracy fails to address the systemic issues inherent in capitalism. The American democratic socialist philosopher [[David Schweickart]] contrasts social democracy with [[democratic socialism]] by defining the former as an attempt to strengthen the [[welfare state]] and the latter as an alternative economic system to capitalism. According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently humanised and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. He gives the example that attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation and too much job security would erode labour discipline.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=447|ps=: \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labor movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanized and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere (e.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labor discipline breaks down.)\"}} In contrast to social democracy's [[mixed economy]], democratic socialists advocate a [[post-capitalist]] economic system based on either a [[Market economy#Market socialism|market economy]] combined with [[workers' self-management]], or on some form of [[Participatory economy|participatory]], [[decentralized planning]] of the economy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=448|ps=: \"Some have endorsed the concept of market socialism, a postcapitalist economy that retains market competition but socializes the means of production and, in some versions, extends democracy to the workplace. Some hold out for a nonmarket, participatory economy. All democratic socialists agree on the need for a democratic alternative to capitalism.\"}}\n\n[[Marxian economics|Marxian]] socialists argue that social democratic welfare policies cannot resolve the fundamental structural issues of capitalism such as [[Business cycle#Marxian economics|cyclical fluctuations]], [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploitation]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]. Accordingly, social democratic programs intended to ameliorate living conditions in capitalism\u2014such as unemployment benefits and taxation on profits\u2014creates further contradictions by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system by reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.{{sfn|Ticktin|1998|pp=60\u201361|ps=: \"The Marxist answers that [...] it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the reserve army of labour, taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion).\"}} The welfare state only serves to legitimize and prolong the exploitative and contradiction-laden system of capitalism to society's detriment. Critics of contemporary social democracy such as Jonas Hinnfors argue that when social democracy abandoned [[Marxism]] it also abandoned socialism and became a liberal capitalist movement, effectively making social democrats similar to non-socialist parties like the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the United States.{{sfn|Hinnfors|2006|pp=117, 137\u2013139}}\n\n[[Market socialism]] is also critical of social democratic welfare states. While one common goal of both concepts is to achieve greater social and economic equality, market socialism does so by changes in enterprise ownership and management whereas social democracy attempts to do so by subsidies and taxes on privately owned enterprises to finance welfare programs. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt III]] (grandson of United States president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]) and David Belkin criticize social democracy for maintaining a [[Property income|property-owning capitalist class]] which has an active interest in reversing social democratic welfare policies and a disproportionate amount of power as a class to influence government policy.{{sfn|Weisskopf|1994|pp=314\u2013315|ps=: \"Social democracy achieves greater egalitarianism via ''ex post'' government taxes and subsidies, where market socialism does so via ''ex ante'' changes in patterns of enterprise ownership [...] the maintenance of property-owning capitalists under social democracy assures the presence of a disproportionately powerful class with a continuing interest in challenging social democratic government policies.\"}} The economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] point out that social democracy requires a strong [[labour movement]] to sustain its heavy redistribution through taxes and that it is idealistic to think such redistribution can be accomplished in other countries with weaker labour movements, noting that social democracy in Scandinavian countries has been in decline as the labour movement weakened.{{sfn|Bardhan|Roemer|1992|p=104|ps=: \"Since it permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labour movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now.\"}}\n\nSome critics claim that social democracy abandoned socialism in the 1930s by endorsing Keynesian [[welfare capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wright|1y=1999|1pp=91|2a1=Fitzpatrick|2y=2003|2pp=2\u20133}} The democratic socialist political theorist [[Michael Harrington]] argues that social democracy historically supported [[Keynesianism]] as part of a \"social democratic compromise\" between capitalism and socialism. This compromise created welfare states and Harrington contends that although this compromise did not allow for the immediate creation of socialism, it \"recognized noncapitalist, and even anticapitalist, principles of human need over and above the imperatives of profit\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=93}} More recently, social democrats in favour of the [[Third Way]] have been accused of having endorsed capitalism, including by anti-Third Way social democrats who have accused Third Way proponents such as [[Anthony Giddens]] of being anti-social democratic and anti-socialist in practice.{{sfn|Cammack|2004|p=155}}\n\nSocial democracy's reformism has been criticized from both the left and right,{{sfnm|1a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain|1y=2002|2a1=Patnaik|2y=2010|2pp=3\u201321|3a1=Nagin|3y=2018}} for if the left was to govern a capitalist economy, it would have to do so according to capitalist, not socialist, logic. This argument was previously echoed by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942), writing: \"Socialists had to govern in an essentially capitalist world [...], a social and economic system that would not function except on capitalist lines. [...] If they were to run it, they would have to run it according to its own logic. They would have to \"administer\" capitalism\".{{sfn|Romano|2006|p=114}} Similarly, [[Irving Kristol]] argued: \"Democratic socialism turns out to be an inherently unstable compound, a contradiction in terms. Every social-democratic party, once in power, soon finds itself choosing, at one point after another, between the socialist society it aspires to and the liberal society that lathered it\".{{sfn|Barrett|1978}} [[Joseph Stalin]] was a vocal critic of reformist social democracy, later coining the term [[social fascism]] to describe social democracy in the 1930s because in this period social democracy embraced a similar [[Corporatism|corporatist economic model]] to the model supported by [[fascism]]. This view was adopted by the [[Communist International]]. It was argued that capitalist society had entered the [[Third Period]] in which a [[proletarian revolution]] was imminent, but it could be prevented by social democrats and other fascist forces.{{sfn|Haro|2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[International Group of Democratic Socialists]]\n* [[List of anti-capitalist and communist parties with national parliamentary representation]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties that have governed]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties and organizations]]\n* [[List of democratic socialists]]\n* [[List of social democratic parties]]\n* [[List of social democrats]]\n* [[Socialist Party]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n==== Books ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book|last=Abjorensen|first=Norman|year=2019|title=Historical Dictionary of Democracy|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781538120743|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1993|title=Political Ideology Today|series=Politics Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978071903346-9|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=2001|title=Political Ideology Today|edition=2nd|series=Politics Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719060199|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|editor1-last=Aggarwal|editor1-first=J.

In the post-Mao China, the Chinese intellectuals are confronted with a variety of models. The liberals favor the American model and share the view that the Soviet model has become archaic and should be totally abandoned. Meanwhile, democratic socialism in Sweden provided an alternative model. Its sustained economic development and extensive welfare programs fascinated many. Numerous scholars within the democratic socialist camp argue that China should model itself politically and economically on Sweden, which is viewed as more genuinely socialist than China.

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite web|author=Vision of Humanity|date=June 2019|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2019/06/GPI-2019-web003.pdf|title=Global Peace Index 2019|website=Vision of Humanity|publisher=Institute for Economics & Peace|accessdate=4 February 2020|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite web|author=Wisconsin Historical Society|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=9192&search_term=socialism|title=Socialism in Milwaukee|work=Dictionary of Wisconsin History|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104021609/https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=9192&search_term=socialism|archive-date=4 November 2012|accessdate=20 December 2019|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book|last1=Brandal|first1=Nik|last2=Bratberg|first2=\u00d8ivind|last3=Thorsen|first3=Dag Einar|year=2013|title=The Nordic Model of Social Democracy|location=Basingstoke, England|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137013262}}\n: {{cite book|year=2011|editor1-last=Cronin|editor1-first=James E.|editor2-last=Ross|editor2-first=George W.|editor3-last=Shoch|editor3-first=James|title=What's Left of the Left: Democrats and Social Democrats in Challenging Times|location=Durham, North Carolina|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822350798}}\n: {{cite book|editor1-last=Evans|editor1-first=Bryan|editor2-last=Schmidt|editor2-first=Ingo|year=2012|title=Social Democracy After the Cold War|location=Edmonton, Alberta|publisher=Athabasca University Press|isbn=9781926836874}}\n: {{cite book|last=Kenworthy|first=Lane|year=2014|title=Social Democratic America|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199322510}}\n: {{cite book|last=Lavelle|first=Ashley|year=2008|title=The Death of Social Democracy: Political Consequences in the 21st Century|location=Aldershot, England|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754670148}}\n: {{cite web|last=Martell|first=Luke|year=2011|url=http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=4089|title=Conflicts in Cosmopolitanism and the Global Left|location=London|publisher=Policy Network|accessdate=3 August 2016}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey D.|year=2006|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=000AF3D5-6DC9-152E-A9F183414B7F0000&colID=31|journal=Scientific American|title=The Social Welfare State, beyond Ideology|volume=295|issue=5|page=42|location=New York|issn=0036-8733|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141326/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=000AF3D5-6DC9-152E-A9F183414B7F0000&colID=31|archivedate=12 October 2007|accessdate=2 August 2016}}\n: {{cite web|last1=Thorsen|first1=Dag Einar|last2=Brandal|first2=Nik|last3=Bratberg|first3=\u00d8ivind|year=2013|url=http://www.fabians.org.uk/utopia-sustained-the-nordic-model-of-social-democracy/|title=Utopia Sustained: The Nordic Model of Social Democracy|location=London|publisher=Fabian Society|accessdate=2 August 2016}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Social democracy}}\n{{Library resources box}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.misc-iecm.mcgill.ca/socdem/epaper.htm|title=Papers on the Future of Social Democracy in Canada|publisher=McGill Institute for the Study of Canada|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412171332/http://www.misc-iecm.mcgill.ca/socdem/epaper.htm|archive-date=12 April 2006|accessdate=11 February 2020}}\n* {{cite web|last=Shaw|first=Martin|year=1999|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/hafa3/socdem.htm|title=Social democracy in the unfinished global revolution|publisher=University of Sussex|accessdate=11 February 2020}}\n\n{{social democracy}}\n{{socialism}}\n{{subject bar|portal1=Society|portal2=Socialism|commons=yes|commons-search=Category:Social democracy|wikt=yes|q=yes|d=yes|d-search=Q121254}}\n{{authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Social Democracy}}\n[[Category:Democracy]]\n[[Category:Democratic socialism]]\n[[Category:Economic ideologies]]\n[[Category:Political ideologies]]\n[[Category:Social democracy| ]]\n[[Category:Social justice]]\n[[Category:Social philosophy|Democracy]]\n[[Category:Socialism]]\n[[Category:Types of socialism]]\n", "name_user": "Davide King", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCriticism:fix wikilink", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy"}

With [[Don Raye]], Mitchum co-wrote the theme song, \"[[The Ballad of Thunder Road]].\" The film features [[Gene Barry]] and [[Jacques Aubuchon]].\n\nThe film's plot concerns running [[moonshine]] in the mountains of [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] in the late 1950s.\n\n''Thunder Road'' became a [[cult film|cult]] [[cult following|classic]] and continued to play at [[drive-in movie theater]]s in some [[Southeastern United States|southeastern states]] through the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Korean War]] veteran Lucas Doolin (Robert Mitchum) works in the family moonshine business, delivering the illegal liquor his father distills to clandestine distribution points throughout the South in his souped-up [[hot rod]]. However, Lucas has more problems than evading the U.S. Treasury agents (\"revenuers\"), led by determined newcomer Troy Barrett ([[Gene Barry]]).\n\nLucas is concerned that his younger brother Robin ([[James Mitchum]]), who is also his mechanic, will be tempted into following in his footsteps and becoming a moonshine runner. A well-funded outside gangster, Carl Kogan ([[Jacques Aubuchon]]), tries to gain control of the independent local moonshine producers and their distribution points and is willing to kill anyone who stands in his way. The stakes rise when an attempt by Kogan to kill Lucas results in the death of a government agent as well as another moonshine driver ([[Mitchell Ryan]]).\n\nIn a romantic subplot, Lucas becomes involved with [[nightclub singer]] Francie Wymore ([[Keely Smith]]). He is unaware one of the neighbor girls, Roxanna Ledbetter (Sandra Knight), has a crush on him and fears for his life.\n\nWhen a series of government raids destroy their hidden stills, Lucas's father and the other local moonshiners shut down production \"for a spell\" to let the government deal with Kogan in its own time, but Lucas is forced by circumstances and his own code of honor to make a final run.\n\n===Factual background===\nThe film was based loosely on an incident in which a driver transporting moonshine was said to have crashed to his death on [[Kingston Pike]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], between Bearden Hill and Morrell Road. Per [[Metro Pulse]] writer Jack Renfro, the incident occurred in 1952 and may have been witnessed by [[James Agee]], who passed the story on to Mitchum.{{citation needed|date = December 2019}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as Lucas Doolin\n* [[Gene Barry]] as Troy Barrett\n* [[Jacques Aubuchon]] as Carl Kogan\n* [[Keely Smith]] as Francie Wymore\n* [[Trevor Bardette]] as Vernon Doolin\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n* [[Sandra Knight (actress)|Sandra Knight]] as Roxanna Ledbetter\n* [[James Mitchum]] as Robin Doolin\n* [[Peter Breck]] as Stacey Gouge, a rival driver\n* [[Mitchell Ryan]] as Jed Moultrie, a decoy driver \n* Nicholas Mann Konrad as Robert Mitchum's stunt driver\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''Cast notes'''\n*The role of Robin Doolin, Lucas's younger brother, was originally written for [[Elvis Presley]] per Mitchum's request. Mitchum personally submitted the script to Elvis in [[Los Angeles]]. The singer was eager to play the role, but his manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]] demanded Elvis be paid an enormous sum of money, more than the entire budget for the movie, which ended negotiations. Mitchum's son James got the part, which worked well owing to his close physical resemblance to his father.\n\n==Production==\nIn the film Mitchum drove a souped-up black 1950 Ford two-door sedan (which was later repainted gray) with a custom tank in the back for moonshine liquor and a Ford V8 with three two barrel carburetors, but after a run in with the law, it was sold and replaced with a 1957 Ford Fairlane 500 two-door sedan with the same alterations excluding the carburetors. The 1950 Ford ended up getting blown up by Kogan whose henchmen had planted a bomb which activated when a Federal agent put the key in the ignition to start the car.  In the film, there was a closeup of the key being inserted in the ignition - a 1951 Ford was used for that interior shot. \n\nMost of the scenes were filmed in [[Woodfin, North Carolina]], along [[U.S. Route 19 in North Carolina|U.S. Route 19]] and others at [[Lake Lure]]. Some scenes were filmed in Beech, east of [[Weaverville, North Carolina|Weaverville]]. Scenes include Reems Creek Road, Sugar Creek Road, and the Beech Community Center. Some scenes were actual local moonshine drivers shot with a camera mounted on a [[Pickup truck|pickup]] [[Trunk (automobile)#Door|tailgate]].

The stunt team included [[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]], Neil Castes Sr., [[Robert Hoy]], and [[Dale Van Sickel]].\n\nThe film's theme song, \"The Whippoorwill,\" was sung by Keely Smith in her role as a nightclub singer, and a different studio rendition by her was released as a 45 RPM single on [[Capitol Records]]. The film's opening song is \"The Ballad of Thunder Road,\" sung by Randy Sparks, a different arrangement of which was recorded by Mitchum and released as a popular 45 RPM single, also on Capitol.

He defined the thought process, and how it reaches the status of conviction or concepts. He discussed the internal working of thoughts, convictions, and concepts in shaping the ''Nafs'' (emotions and sentiments), delving into the internal workings of how people reach conclusions, and the psychology behind the process derives itself from Taqiuddin al-Nabhani's roots in non-Ascetic legalistic Sufism from his first teacher and maternal grandfather Ismail al-Nabhani.\n\nAl-Nabhani's definitions of thought have been used in the study of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and information processing research discussed in the Addison-Wesley published book \"Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine (Systems Programming Series)\" and used in London South Bank University's information systems department.\n\nAfter many philosophical discussions on the nature of thoughts and emotions, Nabhani concludes that the only way to bring about change is through discussion, refutation, and revival of the relevant thoughts and emotions. It is from this philosophical basis that he argued that force does not work to change peoples' ideas. He also argued that a decline in Muslims' mental, emotional and conceptual lives led to the decline of Muslim culture and the eventual destruction of the Caliphate. He believed the first major step in the decline of Muslim culture was confusion about and conflict with new foreign ideas, mainly Greek, Persian & eastern philosophy.\n\nHe argued that the Islamic world did not know how to tackle and contextualize these ideas because they became insular and complacent instead of preserving Islamic thought and philosophy and keeping it relevant to a world in flux. The heavy emphasis on pinpointing, defining and changing peoples thoughts, convictions, or emotions via stronger thoughts, diagnosis, and refutation of the process an individual uses to reach their particular 'incorrect' view, is the method of Hizb ut-Tahrir's argumentation on almost every issue.\n\n===Faith vs. rational belief===\nNabhani claimed that Islam is founded on rational belief and not blind faith, being very similar to Ghazali's Kalam Argument. However, both Nabhani and Ghazali argued that after ''Aqeeda'' (belief) is established, divine laws in the Quran are beyond question due to the 'mind' of God being beyond human comprehension. Nabhani loosely affirmed rationalism (not that of the [[Mu'tazili]]), but argued that it can establish belief in a God just like Ghazali and Ghazali's teacher al-Juwayni in his book [4], contrary to the common western notion of rationalism. He tried to outline materialist arguments and axioms to prove that one unlimited creator of the universe, God ([[Allah]]) can be proven by rational deduction. He believed that the dependency of, and limited physical nature of every tangible thing within human perception point ultimately to an unlimited creator that is beyond need and dependency, an Absolute Infinite.\n\n==Books==\n*''Saving Palestine'' - 1950<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html Sheikh Muhammad Taqiuddin al-Nabhani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819200236/http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html |date=2010-08-19 }}, [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]].</ref>\n*''The Message of the Arabs'' - 1950\n*''The System for Society'' - 1950\n*''The Ruling System in Islam'' - 1953\n*''[[The Economic System In Islam]]'' - 1953\n*''The Social System in Islam'' -1953\n*''The Party Structure'' -1953\n*''The Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic State'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic Personality'' (in three volumes) - 1960\n*''Political Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1969\n*''Political View of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1972\n*''Introduction to the Constitution or the Reasons That Make it Obligatory'' - 1963\n*''The Khilafah'' - 1967\n*''Presence of Mind'' - 1976\n*''A Burning Call to the Muslims from Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1965\n*''Thinking'' - 1973\n*''The Jurisprudence of Prayer''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n\n* {{Cite journal\n |magazine    = Al-Waie Magazine\n |issue       = 234-235\n |date        = August\u2013September 2006\n |language    = Arabic\n |title       = \u0628\u0632\u0648\u063a \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649: \u0627\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631\n |url         = http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209002225/http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |archivedate = 2015-02-09\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n |title       = An-Nabhani: Palestinian Intellectual\n |work        = [[Islamic Da'wah Foundation Malaysia]]\n |url         = http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219055210/http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |archivedate = 2010-12-19\n}}\n* {{Citation |last=Watt|first=Montgomery|title=The Faith and Practice of Al-Ghazali (Translation of al-Munqid min al-Dalal)|year=2004|place=Oxford|publisher=OneWorld Publications}}\n* {{Citation |last=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=The System of Islam Nidham al-Islam|year=2002|publication-place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Thought al-Tafkeer|year=2004|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Islamic Personality al-Shaksiyyah al-Islamiyyah|year=2005|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nabhani, Taqiuddin}}\n[[Category:1929 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:Arab people in British Palestine]]\n[[Category:Palestinian Islamists]]\n[[Category:Members of Hizb ut-Tahrir]]\n[[Category:Al-Azhar University alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Tone|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n'''Kamal al-Din al-Nabhani''' (January 3, 1929 \u2013 December 31, 2006) was one of the founders of the [[Islamist]] political party [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and was the son of Sheikh [[Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani]].\n\n== Early Life ==\nKamal al-Din al-Nabhani was born on January 3, 1929, in [[Beirut, Lebanon]].\n\n== Thought ==\n\n=== Philosophy and Theology ===\nIn his books 'Thought' and 'System of Islam 2' (based on the work of his father [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]]), Nabhani placed heavy emphasis on discussing modes and models of the psychology behind human thought and concepts.

Gordon Jr., ed. 2005.</ref> It was spoken in the territory of present-day eastern [[New York (state)|New York]] state and [[Vermont]], by the [[Mohican]] people.\n\n== History ==\nAboriginally, speakers of Mohican lived along the upper [[Hudson River]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] State, extending as far north as [[Lake Champlain]], east to the [[Green Mountains]] in [[Vermont]], and west near [[Schoharie Creek]] in New York State.<ref>Brasser, Ted, 1978</ref> Conflict with the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] of the Iroquois Confederacy in competition for the [[fur trade]], and European encroachment, triggered displacement of the Mohicans, some moving to west-central New York, where they shared land with the Oneida. After a series of dislocations, some Mohicans were forced to relocate to [[Wisconsin]] in the 1820s and 1830s, while others moved to several communities in [[Canada]], where they lost their Mohican identity.\n\nThe Mohican language became extinct in the early twentieth century, with the last recorded documentation of Mahican made in the 1930s.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1978, p. 71.</ref>\n\n== Dialects ==\n\nTwo distinct Mohican dialects have been identified, ''Moravian'' and ''Stockbridge.'' <ref>Pentland, David, 1992, p. 15</ref> These two dialects emerged after 1740 as aggregations arising from the dislocation of Mohican and other groups.  The extent of Mohican dialect variation prior to this period is uncertain.\n\nThe Stockbridge dialect emerged at [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], and included groups of New York Mohican, and members of other linguistic groups such as [[Wappinger]] (a local Munsee Lenape band), Housatonic, [[Wawyachtonoc]], and others. After a complex migration history, the Stockbridge group moved to Wisconsin, where they combined with [[Munsee language|Munsee]] Lenape migrants from southwestern Ontario. They are now known as the [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community|Stockbridge-Munsee]] tribe.<ref>Brasser, Ted, 1978, pp. 207-210</ref>\n\nThe Moravian dialect arose from population aggregations centred at [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]. Some Mohican groups that had been affiliated from about 1740 with the [[Moravian Church]], in New York and Connecticut, moved in 1746 to Bethlehem. Another group affiliated with the Moravians moved to [[Wyoming, Pennsylvania]]. Subsequent to several members being massacred by white settlers, some members of these groups fled to Canada with Munsee Moravian converts, ultimately settling at what is now [[Moravian 47, Ontario|Moraviantown]], where they have completely merged with the dominant [[Lenape]] population. Another group moved to Ohsweken at [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation|Six Nations]], Ontario, where they merged with other groups at that location.<ref>Brasser, Ted, 1978, p. 208</ref>\n\n== Phonology and documentation ==\n\nMohican linguistic materials consist of a variety of materials collected by missionaries, linguists, and others, including an eighteenth-century manuscript dictionary compiled by Johann Schmick, a Moravian missionary.<ref>Masthay, Carl, 1992</ref> In the twentieth century, linguists Truman Michelson and [[Morris Swadesh]] collected some Mohican materials from surviving speakers in Wisconsin.<ref>Michelson, Truman, 1914.</ref>\n\nMohican [[Sound change|historical phonology]] has been studied based upon the Schmick dictionary manuscript, tracing the historical changes affecting the pronunciation of words between [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]] and the Moravian dialect of Mohican, as reflected in Schmick\u2019s dictionary.<ref>Pentland, David, 1992</ref> The similarities between Mohican and the [[Delaware languages]] [[Munsee language|Munsee]] and [[Unami language|Unami]] have been acknowledged in studies of Mohican linguistic history. In one classification Mohican and the Delaware languages are assigned to a ''Delawaran'' subgroup of Eastern Algonquian.<ref>Pentland, David, 1992, p. 15; Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 5</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Consonant Sounds<ref>Masthay, Carl, 1991, p. 15-26</ref>\n!  !!

Gordon Jr., ed. 2005.</ref> It was spoken in the territory of present-day eastern [[New York (state)|New York]] state and [[Vermont]], by the [[Mohican]] people.\n\n== History ==\nAboriginally, speakers of Mohican lived along the upper [[Hudson River]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] State, extending as far north as [[Lake Champlain]], east to the [[Green Mountains]] in [[Vermont]], and west near [[Schoharie Creek]] in New York State.<ref>Brasser, Ted, 1978</ref> Conflict with the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] of the Iroquois Confederacy in competition for the [[fur trade]], and European encroachment, triggered displacement of the Mohicans, some moving to west-central New York, where they shared land with the Oneida. After a series of dislocations, some Mohicans were forced to relocate to [[Wisconsin]] in the 1820s and 1830s, while others moved to several communities in [[Canada]], where they lost their Mohican identity.\n\nThe Mohican language became extinct in the early twentieth century, with the last recorded documentation of Mahican made in the 1930s.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1978, p. 71.</ref>\n\n== Dialects ==\n\nTwo distinct Mohican dialects have been identified, ''Moravian'' and ''Stockbridge.'' <ref>Pentland, David, 1992, p. 15</ref> These two dialects emerged after 1740 as aggregations arising from the dislocation of Mohican and other groups.  The extent of Mohican dialect variation prior to this period is uncertain.\n\nThe Stockbridge dialect emerged at [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], and included groups of New York Mohican, and members of other linguistic groups such as [[Wappinger]] (a local Munsee Lenape band), Housatonic, Wyachtonok, and others. After a complex migration history, the Stockbridge group moved to Wisconsin, where they combined with [[Munsee language|Munsee]] Lenape migrants from southwestern Ontario. They are now known as the [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community|Stockbridge-Munsee]] tribe.<ref>Brasser, Ted, 1978, pp. 207-210</ref>\n\nThe Moravian dialect arose from population aggregations centred at [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]. Some Mohican groups that had been affiliated from about 1740 with the [[Moravian Church]], in New York and Connecticut, moved in 1746 to Bethlehem. Another group affiliated with the Moravians moved to [[Wyoming, Pennsylvania]]. Subsequent to several members being massacred by white settlers, some members of these groups fled to Canada with Munsee Moravian converts, ultimately settling at what is now [[Moravian 47, Ontario|Moraviantown]], where they have completely merged with the dominant [[Lenape]] population. Another group moved to Ohsweken at [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation|Six Nations]], Ontario, where they merged with other groups at that location.<ref>Brasser, Ted, 1978, p. 208</ref>\n\n== Phonology and documentation ==\n\nMohican linguistic materials consist of a variety of materials collected by missionaries, linguists, and others, including an eighteenth-century manuscript dictionary compiled by Johann Schmick, a Moravian missionary.<ref>Masthay, Carl, 1992</ref> In the twentieth century, linguists Truman Michelson and [[Morris Swadesh]] collected some Mohican materials from surviving speakers in Wisconsin.<ref>Michelson, Truman, 1914.</ref>\n\nMohican [[Sound change|historical phonology]] has been studied based upon the Schmick dictionary manuscript, tracing the historical changes affecting the pronunciation of words between [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]] and the Moravian dialect of Mohican, as reflected in Schmick\u2019s dictionary.<ref>Pentland, David, 1992</ref> The similarities between Mohican and the [[Delaware languages]] [[Munsee language|Munsee]] and [[Unami language|Unami]] have been acknowledged in studies of Mohican linguistic history. In one classification Mohican and the Delaware languages are assigned to a ''Delawaran'' subgroup of Eastern Algonquian.<ref>Pentland, David, 1992, p. 15; Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 5</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Consonant Sounds<ref>Masthay, Carl, 1991, p. 15-26</ref>\n!  !!
