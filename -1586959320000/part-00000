He characterized genes involved in the hereditary predisposition to lung cancer in mice and identified genetic loci that modulate the expression of these genes (PLoS Genet. 2014;10:e1004307;<ref>PLoS Genet. 2014;10:e1004307</ref> Cancer Lett. 2016;375:221-230<ref>Cancer Lett. 2016;375:221-230</ref>).\n\nHe conducted a [[genome-wide association study]] (GWAS) between genetic polymorphisms and lung cancer (J Clin Oncol. 2006;24:1672-8<ref>J Clin Oncol. 2006;24:1672-8</ref>). He demonstrated that polymorphisms in the CHRNA5 gene promoter modulated the transcription of this gene, and thereby showed that genetic variants affected the risks of lung cancer and nicotine dependence (J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010;102:1366-70;<ref>J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010;102:1366-70</ref> Carcinogenesis. 2013;34:1281-5<ref>Carcinogenesis. 2013;34:1281-5</ref>).\n\nHe did a GWAS  on pain relief in cancer patients treated with opioids, demonstrating that different genetic loci control the individual response to this therapy (Clin Cancer Res. 2011;17:4581-7<ref>Clin Cancer Res. 2011;17:4581-7</ref>).\n\nHe discovered the tumor-promoting activity of 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridiloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP), a constitutive androstan receptor agonist ( [12] and he characterized carcinogenicity of [[2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] (TCDD).<ref>Della Porta G, Dragani TA, Sozzi G.

Dragani''' is an Italian genetic [[epidemiologist]] who carried out a series of studies on genetic predisposition to [[cancer]].<ref>Cancer Res. 1993;53:209-11</ref><ref>Nat Genet. 1993;3:132-6</ref><ref>Nat Genet.1996;12:455-7</ref><ref>Oncogene. 2000;19:5324-8</ref><ref>PLoS Genet. 2014;10:e1004307</ref><ref>Cancer Lett. 2016;375:221-230</ref>\n\nResults of his studies allowed the chromosomal mapping of [[quantitative trait]] [[loci]] (QTLs) modulating the genetic predisposition to liver, lung and skin [[tumorigenesis]], in animal models<ref>Cancer Res. 1993;53:209-11</ref><ref>Nat Genet. 1993;3:132-6</ref><ref>Nat Genet.1996;12:455-7</ref><ref>Oncogene. 2000;19:5324-8</ref><ref>PLoS Genet. 2014;10:e1004307</ref><ref>Cancer Lett. 2016;375:221-230</ref>.\n\nHis population-based studies resulted in the identification of [[genetic polymorphisms]] associated with the [[risk]] and prognosis of [[lung cancer]]. He contributed to discovering the mechanism underlying the association between [[polymorphisms]] in [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] subunit genes on [[chromosome 15]] and the risks of [[lung cancer]] and [[nicotine dependence]].<ref>J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010;102:1366-70</ref><ref>Carcinogenesis. 2013;34:1281-5</ref>\n\nHe contributed with a genome-wide study to the pharmacogenomics of [[pain relief]] in response to [[opioid therapy]] for [[cancer]] pain.<ref>Clin Cancer Res. 2011;17:4581-7</ref>\n\nOverall, hE focused mainly on understanding the [[genetic control]] of complex [[phenotypes]], like cancer.\n\n== Biography ==\nTommaso A. Dragani was born in Ortona, Italy, studied Pharmacy at the University of Bologna and received the MPharm degree with honors in 1977, after which he joined the National Cancer Institute in Milan as a researcher.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom June 1984 to June 1985, he was visiting scientist at the laboratory of [[Bernard Weinstein]], [[Columbia University]], and from September 1996 to February 1997 he was visiting scientist at the National Cancer Center of Japan, working with Dr. Minako Nagao.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1998 Tommaso A. Dragani was appointed Director of the Genetic Epidemiology and Pharmacogenomics Research Unit at the National Cancer Institute in Milan. In 2007 he achieved a Masters in Medical Statistics and Statistical Methods in Epidemiology by the [[University of Milan]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Achievements and scientific merits ==\nTommaso A. Dragani identified genetic loci that influence the hereditary predisposition to liver cancer (Cancer Res. 1993;53:209-11<ref>Cancer Res. 1993;53:209-11</ref>), lung cancer (Nat Genet. 1993;3:132-6;<ref>Nat Genet. 1993;3:132-6</ref> Nat Genet.1996;12:455-7<ref>Nat Genet.1996;12:455-7</ref>), and skin cancer (Oncogene. 2000;19:5324-8<ref>Oncogene. 2000;19:5324-8</ref>). He characterized genes involved in the hereditary predisposition to lung cancer in mice and identified genetic loci that modulate the expression of these genes (PLoS Genet. 2014;10:e1004307;<ref>PLoS Genet. 2014;10:e1004307</ref> Cancer Lett. 2016;375:221-230<ref>Cancer Lett. 2016;375:221-230</ref>).\n\nHe conducted a [[genome-wide association study]] (GWAS) between genetic polymorphisms and lung cancer (J Clin Oncol. 2006;24:1672-8<ref>J Clin Oncol. 2006;24:1672-8</ref>). He demonstrated that polymorphisms in the CHRNA5 gene promoter modulated the transcription of this gene, and thereby showed that genetic variants affected the risks of lung cancer and nicotine dependence (J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010;102:1366-70;<ref>J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010;102:1366-70</ref> Carcinogenesis. 2013;34:1281-5<ref>Carcinogenesis. 2013;34:1281-5</ref>).\n\nHe did a GWAS  on pain relief in cancer patients treated with opioids, demonstrating that different genetic loci control the individual response to this therapy (Clin Cancer Res. 2011;17:4581-7<ref>Clin Cancer Res. 2011;17:4581-7</ref>).\n\nHe discovered the tumor-promoting activity of 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridiloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP), a constitutive androstan receptor agonist ( [12] and he characterized carcinogenicity of [[2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] (TCDD).<ref>Della Porta G, Dragani TA, Sozzi G.

After the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] took over control of the [[Cape Colony]] the second colonial governor, [[Lord Charles Somerset|Lord Charles Henry Somerset]] {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]]}}, gave permission for the funds reserved by de Mist to be used to establish the South African College in 1814.\n\nThe founding committee met in the [[Groote Kerk, Cape Town|Groote Kerk]] to discuss funding and accommodation for the school and on 1 October 1829, the inauguration of the South African College was held and classes began. The original location of the school was in the ''Weeshuis'' on Long Street and moved to what is now known as the ''Egyptian Building'' in the Gardens district of Cape Town in 1841.\n\nIt was decided in 1874 that the younger students should be separated from their older counterparts. The South African College was separated into the ''College'' which became the [[University of Cape Town]] and the ''College School''.<ref>{{cite book|title=\tStandard encyclopaedia of Southern Africa, Volume 10|publisher=NASOU|year=1976|page=96}}</ref>\n\nThe College School moved to its own building on Orange Street, separate from the College, in 1896. For the next few decades, the school grew and the building became too small for the number of students attending.\n\nIn 1959 the school moved to its current home in the Montebello Estate in Newlands,<ref>{{cite book|title=Cape Town, city of good hope|last=Honikman|first=A. H.|publisher=H. B. Timmins|year=1966|page=63}}</ref> former home of the mining magnate [[Max Michaelis|Sir Max Michaelis]], after a decade-long negotiation with the Cape Administration.\n\nIn 2012, the school grounds were used to film Spud 2: The Madness Continues. \n\n{{Coord|33|58|13.45|S|18|27|36.38|E|display=title}}\n\n==School buildings==\nThe current school buildings are situated along Dean Street and Newlands Avenue in Cape Town.\n\nThe Junior School is located along Dean Street and is equipped with numerous fields for sporting activities, of which some are shared with the High School. The Junior School has a full length swimming pool with a smaller children's pool for the younger students. A number of [[tennis]] courts are also available to the students. The Junior School has a new Media Centre which hosts computer facilities, a new library and classrooms. The music department also has its own [[auditorium]] for cultural events and is also used for events with smaller audiences. The Junior School's [[boarding house]] is named after ''J E De Villiers''.\n\nThe High School is closest to Newlands Avenue which also hosts a number of sport fields for the various sports which the school offers throughout the year. The swimming pool is mainly used for [[Water Polo]] and is also heated to facilitate training and usage in winter.

During summer, boys wear khaki shorts with long khaki socks and brown shoes. In winter the basic uniform consists of long charcoal pants, black socks and black shoes. Both the summer and winter uniforms are accompanied by the SACS navy-blue blazer, white school shirt and school tie. Both these uniforms can be worn at any time during the school year, except for certain formal school functions where a certain uniform is required.\n\nThe Junior School uniform consists of a white shirt, charcoal shorts, a SACS Junior belt, charcoal socks with thin light and dark blue stripes at the top, black shoes and the Junior School tie, which is similar to the High School tie, apart from one minor difference. The Junior School uniform includes the same blazer as the High School, with the exception of the Junior School not modifying blazers for Blues (colours) awards, as is practised by the high school.\n\n==Rhodes Scholarship==\nWhen [[Cecil John Rhodes]] died in 1902, he specifically named the South African College in his will as one of four schools in the [[Cape Colony]] where the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] would be awarded on an annual basis for a former student to study at the [[University of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodestrust.org.za/about.html|title=Rhodes Scholarships in Southern Africa|date=3 January 2009|first=Tim|last=Nuttall}}</ref>\n\n==Old Boys' Union==\n===Old Boys===\n[[File:The leader and his deputy, jan smuts on the right and jan hofmeyr on the left.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and former Prime Minister of South Africa, [[Jan Smuts]]]]\n*Dr. [[Abdullah Abdurahman]] \u2013 Medical Doctor, Cape Muslim leader & founder of the anti-apartheid movement, African People's Organisation and human rights campaigner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/people/dr-abdullah-abdurahman|title=Dr. Abdullah Abdurahman|last=sahoboss|date=17 February 2011|website=South African History Online}}</ref>\n*Captain [[Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC and bar]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]]\n*[[Kyle Brown (rugby union)|Kyle Brown]] \u2013 [[South Africa national rugby sevens team|South Africa Sevens]] captain 2008\u2013present and [[Olympic Games]] medalist Rio 2016.\n*[[Abraham Fischer]] \u2013 Sole Prime Minister of the Orange River Colony in South Africa<ref>Clingman, Stephen (1998).

After the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] took over control of the [[Cape Colony]] the second colonial governor, [[Lord Charles Somerset|Lord Charles Henry Somerset]] {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]]}}, gave permission for the funds reserved by de Mist to be used to establish the South African College in 1814.\n\nThe founding committee met in the [[Groote Kerk, Cape Town|Groote Kerk]] to discuss funding and accommodation for the school and on 1 October 1829, the inauguration of the South African College was held and classes began. The original location of the school was in the ''Weeshuis'' on Long Street and moved to what is now known as the ''Egyptian Building'' in the Gardens district of Cape Town in 1841.\n\nIt was decided in 1874 that the younger students should be separated from their older counterparts. The South African College was separated into the ''College'' which became the [[University of Cape Town]] and the ''College School''.<ref>{{cite book|title=\tStandard encyclopaedia of Southern Africa, Volume 10|publisher=NASOU|year=1976|page=96}}</ref>\n\nThe College School moved to its own building on Orange Street, separate from the College, in 1896. For the next few decades, the school grew and the building became too small for the number of students attending.\n\nIn 1959 the school moved to its current home in the Montebello Estate in Newlands,<ref>{{cite book|title=Cape Town, city of good hope|last=Honikman|first=A.

The Junior School has a full length swimming pool with a smaller children's pool for the younger students. A number of [[tennis]] courts are also available to the students. The Junior School has a new Media Centre which hosts computer facilities, a new library and classrooms. The music department also has its own [[auditorium]] for cultural events and is also used for events with smaller audiences. The Junior School's [[boarding house]] is named after ''J E De Villiers''.\n\nThe High School is closest to Newlands Avenue which also hosts a number of sport fields for the various sports which the school offers throughout the year. The swimming pool is mainly used for [[Water Polo]] and is also heated to facilitate training and usage in winter. The High School also recently had a new Media Centre constructed with air-conditioned computer labs and library. The school hall is named after one of its most famous students, [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (1894-1948)|Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr]].

Some have been converted to Class&nbsp;320 and are operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]].\n\n==Description==\nThree sub-classes were built. The first two were built for the [[Network SouthEast]] sector for operation on services from [[Liverpool Street railway station|London Liverpool Street]] and [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], while the third was built for [[Regional Railways]] for use on [[West Yorkshire Metro|West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] services from [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]]. As part of the [[privatisation of British Rail]], ownership of the class passed from [[British Rail]]  to the [[Eversholt Rail Group]] in April 1994.<ref>[https://www.eversholtrail.co.uk/fleet-portfolio Class 321] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002065624/https://www.eversholtrail.co.uk/fleet-portfolio |date=2 October 2015 }} Eversholt Rail</ref>\n\nEach unit consisted of four carriages: two outer driving trailers, one of which contained first class seating; an intermediate motor coach with standard class seating only, roof mounted [[Brecknell Willis high speed pantograph]] and four [[Brush Traction]] TM2141C traction motors (two per bogie); and an intermediate trailer with standard class seating. All have a maximum speed of {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThey have been modified by the different rail companies which use them. The modifications include new seats, paintwork, lighting and [[passenger information systems]]. \n\n===Class 321/3===\nIn September 1987,  Network SouthEast ordered 46 321/3s for use on services from [[Liverpool Street station|London Liverpool Street]] to [[Cambridge railway station|Cambridge]] and [[Southend Victoria railway station|Southend Victoria]]. The first was unveiled on 15 September 1988.<ref>\"321 rolled-out\" ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 1051 November 1988 page 687</ref> A further 20 were ordered later.<ref name=therailwaycentre/><ref name=TRUK154>\"The Class 321 EMUs\" ''[[Today's Railways UK]]'' issue 154 October 2014 pages 50-57</ref> Units were numbered 321301-366.\n\nThese units replaced slam-door [[British Rail Class 305|Class 305]], [[British Rail Class 307|Class 307]], [[British Rail Class 308|Class 308]] and [[British Rail Class 309|Class 309]] units on trains to [[Clacton railway station|Clacton]] and [[Southend Victoria railway station|Southend-on-Sea]], and worked services on the newly electrified routes to [[Ipswich railway station|Ipswich]] and [[Harwich Town railway station|Harwich]]. They also displaced many [[British Rail Class 312|Class 312]] slam-door units, which moved over to the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway]]. Some of the Class 309s were retained until 1994, and 24 of the newer Class 312 units were retained long-term to work services to [[Walton-on-the-Naze railway station|Walton-on-the-Naze]] and peak services to Clacton, Ipswich and [[Witham railway station|Witham]]. Units carried Network SouthEast livery from new.\n\nIn March 2008, 321361 was named ''Phoenix'' at [[Ilford EMU Depot|Ilford depot]] after it was rebuilt at the disused [[Colchester Carriage Servicing Depot|Colchester shed]] to repair damage caused by an arson attack at Southend Victoria on 10 July 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therailwaycentre.com/News%20April%202008/290408-NEEA.html|title=321361 becomes Ilford's 'Phoenix'|work=TheRailwayCentre.Com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505135254/http://www.therailwaycentre.com/News%20April%202008/290408-NEEA.html|archivedate=5 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe first of 30 321/3s to be refurbished at [[Doncaster Works]], as part of the Renatus project \u2013 which modernised the stock with features such as new air conditioning and heating, seating and Wi-Fi \u2013 was completed in December 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eversholtrail.co.uk/news/transformation-of-the-east-anglia-train-fleet-is-underway|title= Transformation of the East Anglia train fleet is underway|date=January 2017|publisher=Eversholt Rail Group}}</ref><ref>\"321 goes for Renatus\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 155 October 2015 page 67</ref><ref>\"Refurbished 321 Renatus Launched\" ''[[Modern Railways]]'' issue 821 February 2017 page 10</ref>\n\n===Class 321/4===\n[[File:321401 - Rugby (8959162488).jpg|thumb|right|321401 in [[Network SouthEast]] livery at [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]]]]\nIn October 1988 a second batch of 30 was ordered. It was intended that 25 be used on [[Great Eastern Main Line]] services and five on [[West Coast Main Line]] services, but in the event all were delivered to [[Bletchley TMD]] for use on the latter. A further 18 followed.<ref name=TRUK154/> Units were numbered 321401\u2013321448. The first was delivered in July 1989.<ref>\"Northampton line Class 321 handed over at BREL, York\" ''Rail'' issue 100 page 17</ref>\n\nThese were built for outer-suburban services on the [[West Coast Main Line]], from [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] to [[Northampton railway station|Northampton]], [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]] and [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]]. They displaced the then-recently cascaded [[British Rail Class 317|Class 317s]] dating from 1981 which had themselves only just been introduced to the route to replace [[British Rail Class 310|Class 310 units]].<ref name=TRUK154/>\n\nEleven 321/4s were transferred for Great Eastern Main Line services. Following this their First Class area was reduced in size to standardise with the 321/3 units in useon that route. This involved removal of the centre partition and double doors and re-upholstering the First Class style 2+2 seats (which were retained at that time) in the de-classified area into the same fabric as the Standard Class seats. Later the First Class 2+2 seats in this de-classified area were replaced with the standard style 2+3 seating. These 11 units were also fitted with a facility to lock out the power door operation within the unit (a basic kind of Selective Operation) to permit operation of 12-car trains on the Braintree and Southminster branch lines, where some platforms were only long enough for 8-car trains.\n\nThe 11 Great Eastern sets passed to [[First Great Eastern]] in January 1997, passing with the franchise to [[National Express East Anglia]] in April 2004 and [[Abellio Greater Anglia]] in February 2012. The 37 West Coast sets passed to [[Silverlink]] in January 1997, passing with the franchise to [[London Midland]] in November 2007. In 2006 unit 321423 was loaned to [[Northern Rail]] while the 321/9s were being overhauled.\n\nFollowing the delivery of the [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/2]] fleet, 13 Class 321/4s (401\u2013410, 418\u2013420) were transferred from London Midland to [[First Capital Connect]] and overhauled by [[Wabtec Corporation|Wabtec's]] [[Doncaster Works]].<ref>\"FCC receives its first Class 321\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 89 May 2009 page 65</ref><ref>\"FCC signs lease for extra Class 321s and 313s\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 101 May 2010 page 65</ref> These passed with the franchise to [[Thameslink and Great Northern|Great Northern]] in September 2014. London Midland also released 17 (421\u2013437) for transfer to National Express East Anglia. The remaining seven (411\u2013417) passed to [[Abellio ScotRail]] in 2015, after being converted to three-car [[British Rail Class 320|Class 320/4]] at Doncaster Works.<ref name=\"auto\">\"ScotRail to receive LM Class 321/4s\" ''Rail'' issue 766 21 January 2015 page 27</ref>\n\nIn 2017 ten units (402, 405\u2013410, 418\u2013420) were transferred from Great Northern to Abellio Greater Anglia.<ref name=MR817>\"More EMUs for Anglia\" ''Modern Railways'' issue 817 October 2016 page 12</ref> As at May 2018 the remaining three (401, 403, 404) are to be converted by Wabtec at [[Kilmarnock]] to Class 320/4 for use with Abellio ScotRail.

These units have a similar formation to the earlier units except that there is no first class seating. They were ordered by [[Regional Railways]] for use on [[West Yorkshire Metro|West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] services on the newly electrified [[Wakefield line|Doncaster to Leeds]] route, entering service in 1993. From 1995 they also worked on [[Wharfedale line]] services from Leeds to [[Ilkley railway station|Ilkley]].<ref>\"Ilkley working for Class 321\" ''Rail'' issue 264 25 October 1995 page 26</ref> In March 1997 they passed with the Regional Railways North East franchise to Northern Spirit, which became [[Arriva Trains Northern]] in April 2001. In June 1998 they were loaned to [[Great North Eastern Railway|GNER]] to operate Leeds to [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]] services while its [[InterCity 225]] fleet was grounded with mechanical issues.<ref>\"GNER drafts in foreign EMUs to covers for 225s\" ''Rail'' issue 334 1 July 1998 page 9</ref> All three passed with the franchise to [[Northern Rail]] in December 2004.\n\nThe Class 321/9 units were refurbished at [[Andrew Barclay Sons & Co.|Hunslet-Barclay]], [[Kilmarnock]] from late 2006 to early 2007.<ref name=\"Railway Herald\">{{cite news | url =http://www.railwayherald.co.uk/magazine/pdf/RHUK/Issue60HIGH.pdf| title = News Desk| magazine = Railway Herald | page = 6,7 | issue = 60 | date = 3 November 2006 | accessdate = 16 July 2011}}</ref> The refurbishment included a new livery, refurbished interiors and reliability improvements, similar to the [[British Rail Class 322|Class 322]] EMUs, which were also refurbished at Kilmarnock.<ref name=\"Railway Herald \"/>\n\nThe units transferred to [[Arriva Rail North]] in April 2016, and then [[Northern Trains]] on 1 March 2020. With the Class 331s now in service, 2 of the Class 321/9s transferred to Greater Anglia, as an interim measure until their Class 720 fleet is in service, however neither unit has operated a service as of 12th April 2020\n\n==Current operations==\n===Greater Anglia===\n[[First Great Eastern]] inherited all 66 Class 321/3s and 11 Class 321/4s. The [[East Anglia franchise]] was subsequently taken over by [[National Express East Anglia]], initially branded 'one', and then subsequently by [[Abellio Greater Anglia|Greater Anglia]]. A further 16 were added, upon release from [[London Midland]]. In 2016, 10 of the sets formerly operated by [[Thameslink and Great Northern|Great Northern]] also transferred to Greater Anglia.\n\nThese trains are primarily used for [[Liverpool Street railway station|London Liverpool Street]] to {{stnlnk|Braintree|England}}, {{stnlnk|Southend Victoria}}, {{stnlnk|Southminster}}, {{stnlnk|Ipswich}} (extending to {{stnlnk|Norwich}} during peak time), {{stnlnk|Walton-on-the-Naze}}, {{stnlnk|Clacton-on-Sea}} and [[Colchester Town railway station|Colchester Town]] but can be seen running on any electrified route if other trains fail. These operate as 4, 8 or 12 carriage sets.\n\nThey have also received 2 Class 321/9s from Northern until the [[British Rail Class 720|Class 720s]] enter service, however neither have entered service as of April 2020.\n\n=== Northern Trains ===\n[[Northern Trains]] inherited three Class 321/9 units from the previous operator, [[Arriva Rail North|Northern]]. These units operate on the [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]] to [[Doncaster railway station|Doncaster]] [[Wakefield line]] service and occasionally on the [[Wharfedale line|Wharfedale]] and [[Airedale line|Airedale]] lines alongside [[British Rail Class 322|Class 322]], [[British Rail Class 333|Class 333s]] and [[British Rail Class 331|Class 331s]]. All passed on to [[Northern Rail]] in 2004 and were refurbished in 2006/07. With the Class 331s having replaced them on Northern Trains duties, 2 of the class 321/9s moved to [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Greater Anglia]] in March 2020, however, as of April 2020, 321903 remains with Northern Trains.\n\n==Former operations==\n===Silverlink / London Midland===\n[[File:321425 A A Watford Junction.JPG|thumb|left|[[Silverlink]] liveried 321425 at {{stnlnk|Watford Junction}}]]\n[[File:321411 Watford Junction E.JPG|thumb|right|[[London Midland]] 321411 at [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]]]]\n[[Silverlink]] inherited 37 of the 48 Class 321/4 units. In September 2003, Silverlink's class 321 units were temporarily withdrawn following the discovery of loose bolts on brake discs in some units.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/entire-fleet-of-commuter-trains-withdrawn-579574.html|last=Elston|first=Laura|title=Entire fleet of commuter trains withdrawn|work=[[The Independent]]|date=11 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2004, London Euston to Birmingham local services were divided into two separate services: Silverlink retained London to Northampton services, while fellow [[National Express]] subsidiary [[Central Trains]] taking over all local services between Northampton and Birmingham. Initially, Central Trains hired Class 321 units from Silverlink to work their new services, but the arrival of [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/1s]] meant that very few Class 321 units were then required.\n\nTo accommodate this sub-lease, three Class 321/3 units were transferred from [[National Express East Anglia]] to Silverlink. These were not permitted north of [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]] due to lack of the National Radio Network system (Eastern Region units only had the Cab Secure Radio System used for Driver Only Operated Passenger services) and therefore could not be used on Central Trains services (although they occasionally appeared on services to Rugby at weekends due to the line being closed between Rugby and Birmingham New Street).

The first two were built for the [[Network SouthEast]] sector for operation on services from [[Liverpool Street railway station|London Liverpool Street]] and [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], while the third was built for [[Regional Railways]] for use on [[West Yorkshire Metro|West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] services from [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]].

They also displaced many [[British Rail Class 312|Class 312]] slam-door units, which moved over to the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway]]. Some of the Class 309s were retained until 1994, and 24 of the newer Class 312 units were retained long-term to work services to [[Walton-on-the-Naze railway station|Walton-on-the-Naze]] and peak services to Clacton, Ipswich and [[Witham railway station|Witham]]. Units carried Network SouthEast livery from new.\n\nIn March 2008, 321361 was named ''Phoenix'' at [[Ilford EMU Depot|Ilford depot]] after it was rebuilt at the disused [[Colchester Carriage Servicing Depot|Colchester shed]] to repair damage caused by an arson attack at Southend Victoria on 10 July 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therailwaycentre.com/News%20April%202008/290408-NEEA.html|title=321361 becomes Ilford's 'Phoenix'|work=TheRailwayCentre.Com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505135254/http://www.therailwaycentre.com/News%20April%202008/290408-NEEA.html|archivedate=5 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe first of 30 321/3s to be refurbished at [[Doncaster Works]], as part of the Renatus project \u2013 which modernised the stock with features such as new air conditioning and heating, seating and Wi-Fi \u2013 was completed in December 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eversholtrail.co.uk/news/transformation-of-the-east-anglia-train-fleet-is-underway|title= Transformation of the East Anglia train fleet is underway|date=January 2017|publisher=Eversholt Rail Group}}</ref><ref>\"321 goes for Renatus\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 155 October 2015 page 67</ref><ref>\"Refurbished 321 Renatus Launched\" ''[[Modern Railways]]'' issue 821 February 2017 page 10</ref>\n\n===Class 321/4===\n[[File:321401 - Rugby (8959162488).jpg|thumb|right|321401 in [[Network SouthEast]] livery at [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]]]]\nIn October 1988 a second batch of 30 was ordered.

Following this their First Class area was reduced in size to standardise with the 321/3 units in useon that route. This involved removal of the centre partition and double doors and re-upholstering the First Class style 2+2 seats (which were retained at that time) in the de-classified area into the same fabric as the Standard Class seats. Later the First Class 2+2 seats in this de-classified area were replaced with the standard style 2+3 seating. These 11 units were also fitted with a facility to lock out the power door operation within the unit (a basic kind of Selective Operation) to permit operation of 12-car trains on the Braintree and Southminster branch lines, where some platforms were only long enough for 8-car trains.\n\nThe 11 Great Eastern sets passed to [[First Great Eastern]] in January 1997, passing with the franchise to [[National Express East Anglia]] in April 2004 and [[Abellio Greater Anglia]] in February 2012. The 37 West Coast sets passed to [[Silverlink]] in January 1997, passing with the franchise to [[London Midland]] in November 2007. In 2006 unit 321423 was loaned to [[Northern Rail]] while the 321/9s were being overhauled.\n\nFollowing the delivery of the [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/2]] fleet, 13 Class 321/4s (401\u2013410, 418\u2013420) were transferred from London Midland to [[First Capital Connect]] and overhauled by [[Wabtec Corporation|Wabtec's]] [[Doncaster Works]].<ref>\"FCC receives its first Class 321\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 89 May 2009 page 65</ref><ref>\"FCC signs lease for extra Class 321s and 313s\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 101 May 2010 page 65</ref> These passed with the franchise to [[Thameslink and Great Northern|Great Northern]] in September 2014.

They were ordered by [[Regional Railways]] for use on [[West Yorkshire Metro|West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] services on the newly electrified [[Wakefield line|Doncaster to Leeds]] route, entering service in 1993.

In June 1998 they were loaned to [[Great North Eastern Railway|GNER]] to operate Leeds to [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]] services while its [[InterCity 225]] fleet was grounded with mechanical issues.<ref>\"GNER drafts in foreign EMUs to covers for 225s\" ''Rail'' issue 334 1 July 1998 page 9</ref> All three passed with the franchise to [[Northern Rail]] in December 2004.\n\nThe Class 321/9 units were refurbished at [[Andrew Barclay Sons & Co.|Hunslet-Barclay]], [[Kilmarnock]] from late 2006 to early 2007.<ref name=\"Railway Herald\">{{cite news | url =http://www.railwayherald.co.uk/magazine/pdf/RHUK/Issue60HIGH.pdf| title = News Desk| magazine = Railway Herald | page = 6,7 | issue = 60 | date = 3 November 2006 | accessdate = 16 July 2011}}</ref> The refurbishment included a new livery, refurbished interiors and reliability improvements, similar to the [[British Rail Class 322|Class 322]] EMUs, which were also refurbished at Kilmarnock.<ref name=\"Railway Herald \"/>\n\nThe units transferred to [[Arriva Rail North]] in April 2016, and then [[Northern Trains]] on 1 March 2020. With the Class 331s now in service, 2 of the Class 321/9s transferred to Greater Anglia, as an interim measure until their Class 720 fleet is in service, however neither unit has operated a service as of 12th April 2020\n\n==Current operations==\n===Greater Anglia===\n[[First Great Eastern]] inherited all 66 Class 321/3s and 11 Class 321/4s. The [[East Anglia franchise]] was subsequently taken over by [[National Express East Anglia]], initially branded 'one', and then subsequently by [[Abellio Greater Anglia|Greater Anglia]]. A further 16 were added, upon release from [[London Midland]]. In 2016, 10 of the sets formerly operated by [[Thameslink and Great Northern|Great Northern]] also transferred to Greater Anglia.\n\nThese trains are primarily used for [[Liverpool Street railway station|London Liverpool Street]] to {{stnlnk|Braintree|England}}, {{stnlnk|Southend Victoria}}, {{stnlnk|Southminster}}, {{stnlnk|Ipswich}} (extending to {{stnlnk|Norwich}} during peak time), {{stnlnk|Walton-on-the-Naze}}, {{stnlnk|Clacton-on-Sea}} and [[Colchester Town railway station|Colchester Town]] but can be seen running on any electrified route if other trains fail. These operate as 4, 8 or 12 carriage sets.\n\nThey have also received 2 Class 321/9s from Northern until the [[British Rail Class 720|Class 720s]] enter service, however neither have entered service as of April 2020.\n\n=== Northern Trains ===\n[[Northern Trains]] inherited three Class 321/9 units from the previous operator, [[Arriva Rail North|Northern]]. These units operate on the [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]] to [[Doncaster railway station|Doncaster]] [[Wakefield line]] service and occasionally on the [[Wharfedale line|Wharfedale]] and [[Airedale line|Airedale]] lines alongside [[British Rail Class 322|Class 322]], [[British Rail Class 333|Class 333s]] and [[British Rail Class 331|Class 331s]]. All passed on to [[Northern Rail]] in 2004 and were refurbished in 2006/07. With the Class 331s having replaced them on Northern Trains duties, 2 of the class 321/9s moved to [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Greater Anglia]] in March 2020, however, as of April 2020, 321903 remains with Northern Trains.\n\n==Former operations==\n===Silverlink / London Midland===\n[[File:321425 A A Watford Junction.JPG|thumb|left|[[Silverlink]] liveried 321425 at {{stnlnk|Watford Junction}}]]\n[[File:321411 Watford Junction E.JPG|thumb|right|[[London Midland]] 321411 at [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]]]]\n[[Silverlink]] inherited 37 of the 48 Class 321/4 units. In September 2003, Silverlink's class 321 units were temporarily withdrawn following the discovery of loose bolts on brake discs in some units.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/entire-fleet-of-commuter-trains-withdrawn-579574.html|last=Elston|first=Laura|title=Entire fleet of commuter trains withdrawn|work=[[The Independent]]|date=11 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2004, London Euston to Birmingham local services were divided into two separate services: Silverlink retained London to Northampton services, while fellow [[National Express]] subsidiary [[Central Trains]] taking over all local services between Northampton and Birmingham. Initially, Central Trains hired Class 321 units from Silverlink to work their new services, but the arrival of [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/1s]] meant that very few Class 321 units were then required.\n\nTo accommodate this sub-lease, three Class 321/3 units were transferred from [[National Express East Anglia]] to Silverlink. These were not permitted north of [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]] due to lack of the National Radio Network system (Eastern Region units only had the Cab Secure Radio System used for Driver Only Operated Passenger services) and therefore could not be used on Central Trains services (although they occasionally appeared on services to Rugby at weekends due to the line being closed between Rugby and Birmingham New Street). This ceased in late 2005 with the introduction of Class 350 trains on the Birmingham to [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool]] route. One of these sub-leased units was involved in a low-speed derailment at Watford Yard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/raib-reports/derailment-at-watford-junction-yard|title=Rail Accident Investigation Branch report, Derailment at Watford Junction yard|work=UK Government|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2007, Central Trains began using Class 321 units on some morning services from Birmingham New Street to [[Walsall railway station|Walsall]].\n\nIn November 2007, [[London Midland]] took over operation of the Class 321 fleet previously used by Silverlink and Central Trains. An order was placed by London Midland for 37 [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/2s]] to replace the Class 321s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/general/2008/07/01-bletchley-depot-closes.html|title=End of the line for award-winning depot|work=Railnews|date=1 July 2008|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nLondon Midland withdrew most, retaining seven units (411-417).<ref>\"London Midland keeps seven Class 321s\" ''[[Rail Express]]'' issue 158 July 2009 page 51</ref><ref>\"London Midland confirms retention of seven Class 321s\" ''Today's Railways'' issue 92 August 2009 page 63</ref> They were used for peak hour workings between London Euston and Northampton and on the [[Abbey line]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonmidland.com/news/latest-news/london-midlands-321-trains-get-a-fresh-coat-of-paint|title=London Midland\u2019s 321 trains get a fresh coat of paint|work=London Midland|date=11 June 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126134251/http://londonmidland.com/news/latest-news/london-midlands-321-trains-get-a-fresh-coat-of-paint/|archivedate=26 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonmidland.com/news/latest-news/london-midland-to-introduce-more-seats-for-london-commuters|title=London Midland to introduce more seats for London commuters|work=London Midland|date=1 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122103913/http://www.londonmidland.com/news/latest-news/london-midland-to-introduce-more-seats-for-london-commuters|archivedate=22 January 2010}}</ref> In 2015 all seven were withdrawn for transfer to [[Abellio ScotRail]] to operate on [[Glasgow]] suburban lines, with the last withdrawn on 20 September 2015.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\">\"London Midand starts operation of four-car Class 319s\" ''Rail'' issue 785 14 October 2015 page 28</ref> They were replaced by [[British Rail Class 319|Class 319s]].<ref>\"London Midland takes on Class 319s for Euston work\" ''Rail'' issue 779 22 July 2015 page 30</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> Two (413/414) briefly operated for [[London Overground Rail Operations]] in late 2015, being revinyled in [[London Overground]] livery.<ref>\"LO hires Scottish bound ex LM Class 321/4s\" ''Rail'' issue 788 25 November 2015 page 28</ref> The cascaded Class 321s were reformed to three-car units, by removing the TSO vehicle and reclassified as [[British Rail Class 320|Class 320/4s]].<ref>[http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/system/files/documents/tsc-basic-pages/Redacted%20Franchise%20Agreement%20-%20CU%20version.pdf The Scottish Ministers and Abellio Scotrail Limited: Scotrail Franchise Agreement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129050858/http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/system/files/documents/tsc-basic-pages/Redacted%20Franchise%20Agreement%20-%20CU%20version.pdf |date=29 November 2015 }} Transport Scotland 6 March 2015</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>\"London Midland 321s Scotland Bound\" ''[[Railways Illustrated]]'' September 2015 page 10</ref> The TSO has been discarded, but one reserve is reserved for Doncaster Wabtec works.<ref>\"321 coaches to be scrapped\" ''Rail'' issue 818 18 January 2017 page 29</ref><ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/james_pilbeam/48139019546/in/photolist-2gkT4nC 769424 (319424) Doncaster 22/06/19]</ref>\n\n===First Capital Connect / Great Northern===\n[[File:321420 321405 London Kings Cross.jpg|thumb|[[First Capital Connect]] 321420 + 321405 at [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]]]]\n[[First Capital Connect]] received thirteen units (401-410, 418-420) from [[London Midland]], following deliveries of the new [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/2s]].

University Debating and Literary Club (UDLC) formerly University Literary Club of the university organises the festival. Some of the previous invitees include news anchor and author [[Rajdeep Sardesai]], poet [[Keki N. Daruwalla]], politician [[Mani Shankar Aiyar]] and independent journalist [[Rana Ayyub]].\n\n==Organisation==\n{{unsourced section}}\nThe festival is organized under the auspices of the University Literary and Debating Club of the [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. The club consists of students as its members. The festival is the University Debating and Literary Club's flagship event. \n\nJournalists like [[Rajdeep Sardesai]] talking about media, activists such as [[Paranjoy Guha Thakurta]] talking about crony capitalism and novelists like [[:de:Chandrahas Choudhury|Chandrahas Choudhury]] having panel discussions about the Indian novel; the festival is a diverse celebration of literature and mass communication, in all its forms.\n\nThe festival attracts audience from all across the city, transcending the boundary of the university. Previous invitees include the poet [[Keki N. Daruwalla]], politician [[Mani Shankar Aiyar]] and independent journalist [[Rana Ayyub]]. With people from diverse areas coming together and talking about the issues of the day and age, the festival is truly a melting pot of culture. Workshops to teach students about the ins and outs of various forms of writing and public speaking are also conducted as a part of the festival, which rounds out the educational experience.\n\nThe University Literary Club was established in 1973. The club is the extension of the oldest literary Society of AMU, the \"[[Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College]] Literary Society\" founded by [[Sir Syed Ahmad Khan]] himself. The University Literary Club was rechristened as University Debating Literary Club in 2015.\n\n==Past festivals==\n\n=== Lit Fest 2017 ===\nThe festival was organised from 3-5 March, 2017.\n\n* '''List of Guests in 2017'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Some of the previous invitees include news anchor and author [[Rajdeep Sardesai]], poet [[Keki N. Daruwalla]], politician [[Mani Shankar Aiyar]] and independent journalist [[Rana Ayyub]].\n\n==Organisation==\n\nThe festival is organized under the auspices of the University Literary and Debating Club of the [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. The club consists of students as its members. The festival is the University Debating and Literary Club's flagship event. \n\nJournalists like [[Rajdeep Sardesai]] talking about media, activists such as [[Paranjoy Guha Thakurta]] talking about crony capitalism and novelists like [[:de:Chandrahas Choudhury|Chandrahas Choudhury]] having panel discussions about the Indian novel; the festival is a diverse celebration of literature and mass communication, in all its forms.\n\nThe festival attracts audience from all across the city, transcending the boundary of the university. Previous invitees include the poet [[Keki N. Daruwalla]], politician [[Mani Shankar Aiyar]] and independent journalist [[Rana Ayyub]]. With people from diverse areas coming together and talking about the issues of the day and age, the festival is truly a melting pot of culture. Workshops to teach students about the ins and outs of various forms of writing and public speaking are also conducted as a part of the festival, which rounds out the educational experience.\n\nThe University Literary Club was established in 1973. The club is the extension of the oldest literary Society of AMU, the \"[[Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College]] Literary Society\" founded by [[Sir Syed Ahmad Khan]] himself. The University Literary Club was rechristened as University Debating Literary Club in 2015.\n\n==Past festivals==\n\n=== Lit Fest 2017 ===\nThe festival was organised from 3-5 March, 2017.\n\n* '''List of Guests in 2017'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]], while [[R. D. Rajasekhar]] handled the cinematography and [[Suresh Urs]] worked as the editor.\n\nThe film, produced by Wide Angle Creations in association with the [[Hinduja Group]] company IN Entertainment, was officially announced in November 2010, with [[Vishnuvardhan (director)|Vishnuvardhan]] as the director. Due to schedule clashes, Vishnuvardhan was replaced by Chakri Toleti, with a new script having been penned by a team involving Toleti, [[Sarath Mandava]] and Eric Felberg.\n\nPrincipal photography happened between July 2011 and December 2011. The filming primarily took place at [[Tamil Nadu]], Goa, [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. ''Billa II'' was released worldwide on 13 July 2012 and a dubbed Telugu version titled ''David Billa'' was also simultaneously released in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]] (then both states were combined under Andhra Pradesh state).<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/billa-2-to-release-wide-in-foreign-languages-news-tamil-mg0jN1dcgjg.html?scategory=tamil|title=Billa 2 to release wide in foreign languages!|publisher=Sify|date=26 June 2012|accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref> The film garnered mixed reviews on release, though it collected decently at the box office because of the hype that created during pre-release. Eventually the film turned out to be one of the cults in Tamil films for its making and stylish presentation of protogonist.\n\n==Plot==\nDavid Billa ([[Ajith Kumar]]), an Sri Lankan refugee along with several others, arrives to the camp in [[Rameswaram]] where he befriends Ranjith ([[Yog Japee]]). The refugee camp is constantly terrorised by corrupt police officer Raghubir Sinha ([[Krishna Kumar (actor)|Krishna Kumar]]). Billa attacks Raghubir when he tries to forcefully detain one of his friends and for revenge he gets Billa tortured in police cell and vows to make him suffer. A few days later, Billa and Ranjith are hired to transport fish from Rameswaram to Chennai. But unknown to them, it was a plot by Raghubir to trap them as the truck they were driving had diamonds inside. But Billa realises the ploy and kills all the cops and drive the truck to its destination where they meet Selvaraj ([[Ilavarasu]]), who is pleased by Billa's loyalty and includes him in his business. Billa murders Raghubir at a [[brothel]].\n\nKotiswara Rao ([[Manoj K. Jayan]]) visits Selvaraj and asks him if he could help in selling off the heroin he had brought along with him. Billa volunteers to sell it off and tries to deal the heroin to a local thug who refuses to pay for it in return. In a brutal scuffle that ensues where one of Billa's friends is slaughtered, Billa kills them all and goes directly to Koti's boss Abbasi ([[Sudhanshu Pandey]]) with the money and the heroin, who is very impressed by the former and recruits him. Abbasi is in business with Barovian mafia led by Dimitri ([[Vidyut Jammwal]]), who tells him that his arms consignment has been held by the Indian coastal guard and he asks for his help. Billa and Ranjith agree to retrieve the consignment for him and are congratulated by Dimitri for their work.\n\nBilla climbs the ladder of Abbasi's gang quickly. Later he learns of his sister death and brings his niece Jasmine ([[Parvathy Omanakuttan]]) with him. Billa and Koti travel to Russia to meet Dimitri, who happens to own an arms and ammunition manufacturing unit. Billa signs a deal with Dimitri without Abbasi's knowledge who learns this from Koti and is furious at Billa. Tensions further increase when Billa beats up Satish Kumar ([[Rohit Khurana]]), the son of an influential minister Praveen Kumar ([[Dinesh Lamba]]), when he tries to misbehave with Jasmine in a party. Abbasi expresses his discontent and vents at him. Billa, surprised and enraged at his ingratitude, walks away with Ranjith. Billa, Ranjith, and Ram (Sarath Mandava) plot to venture into the drug business on their own during the carnival. At the carnival, Billa is betrayed by Ram and is brutally attacked. However, he survives and finishes off the assailants, kills Abbasi and Ram, and becomes Goa's most powerful gangster. He begins a relationship with Abbasi's girlfriend Sameera ([[Bruna Abdullah]]).\n\nDimitri arrives to Goa and has a fallout with Billa when they try to negotiate a deal with Billa. So, Dimitri seeks to oust him. Dimitri seeks out the help of Koti, Satish, and Praveen to eliminate David. They proceed to kill Chief Minister Mohan Kanth ([[Madhusudhan Rao (actor)|Madhusudhan Rao]]), and the blame falls upon Billa. However, Billa is freed by threatening the judge and his family. After coming out, Billa rescues his niece from Koti's men and informs Sameera to take Jasmine to safety. But Sameera betrays Billa, informs the minister's son who hold Billa and Jasmine captives. Billa while being held to the ground and is mocked at by Satish, who slits Jasmine's throat. Enraged at her death, Billa overpowers and kills everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, in Russia, Dimitri is having an auction of his weapons, and Koti is present with him. He shows his factory in his computer via a series of webcams and much to everyone's shock, Billa is seen destroying his factory in Georgia. He also sees his consignment train go off course. He gets angered and kills Koti for not killing Billa, and he sets out himself to finish the task. The arms factory is destroyed by Billa and his friends. Dimitri arrives and follows his delivery train, when to his shock, the delivery train is blown by Billa, who would be waiting for him on his own helicopter. After an intense battle, Billa kills Dimitri.

Eventually the film turned out to be one of the cults in Tamil films for its making and stylish presentation of protogonist.\n\n==Plot==\nDavid Billa ([[Ajith Kumar]]), an Sri Lankan refugee along with several others, arrives to the camp in [[Rameswaram]] where he befriends Ranjith ([[Yog Japee]]). The refugee camp is constantly terrorised by corrupt police officer Raghubir Sinha ([[Krishna Kumar (actor)|Krishna Kumar]]). Billa attacks Raghubir when he tries to forcefully detain one of his friends and for revenge he gets Billa tortured in police cell and vows to make him suffer. A few days later, Billa and Ranjith are hired to transport fish from Rameswaram to Chennai. But unknown to them, it was a plot by Raghubir to trap them as the truck they were driving had diamonds inside. But Billa realises the ploy and kills all the cops and drive the truck to its destination where they meet Selvaraj ([[Ilavarasu]]), who is pleased by Billa's loyalty and includes him in his business. Billa murders Raghubir at a [[brothel]].\n\nKotiswara Rao ([[Manoj K. Jayan]]) visits Selvaraj and asks him if he could help in selling off the heroin he had brought along with him. Billa volunteers to sell it off and tries to deal the heroin to a local thug who refuses to pay for it in return. In a brutal scuffle that ensues where one of Billa's friends is slaughtered, Billa kills them all and goes directly to Koti's boss Abbasi ([[Sudhanshu Pandey]]) with the money and the heroin, who is very impressed by the former and recruits him. Abbasi is in business with Barovian mafia led by Dimitri ([[Vidyut Jammwal]]), who tells him that his arms consignment has been held by the Indian coastal guard and he asks for his help. Billa and Ranjith agree to retrieve the consignment for him and are congratulated by Dimitri for their work.\n\nBilla climbs the ladder of Abbasi's gang quickly. Later he learns of his sister death and brings his niece Jasmine ([[Parvathy Omanakuttan]]) with him. Billa and Koti travel to Russia to meet Dimitri, who happens to own an arms and ammunition manufacturing unit. Billa signs a deal with Dimitri without Abbasi's knowledge who learns this from Koti and is furious at Billa. Tensions further increase when Billa beats up Satish Kumar ([[Rohit Khurana]]), the son of an influential minister Praveen Kumar ([[Dinesh Lamba]]), when he tries to misbehave with Jasmine in a party. Abbasi expresses his discontent and vents at him. Billa, surprised and enraged at his ingratitude, walks away with Ranjith. Billa, Ranjith, and Ram (Sarath Mandava) plot to venture into the drug business on their own during the carnival. At the carnival, Billa is betrayed by Ram and is brutally attacked. However, he survives and finishes off the assailants, kills Abbasi and Ram, and becomes Goa's most powerful gangster. He begins a relationship with Abbasi's girlfriend Sameera ([[Bruna Abdullah]]).\n\nDimitri arrives to Goa and has a fallout with Billa when they try to negotiate a deal with Billa. So, Dimitri seeks to oust him. Dimitri seeks out the help of Koti, Satish, and Praveen to eliminate David. They proceed to kill Chief Minister Mohan Kanth ([[Madhusudhan Rao (actor)|Madhusudhan Rao]]), and the blame falls upon Billa. However, Billa is freed by threatening the judge and his family. After coming out, Billa rescues his niece from Koti's men and informs Sameera to take Jasmine to safety. But Sameera betrays Billa, informs the minister's son who hold Billa and Jasmine captives. Billa while being held to the ground and is mocked at by Satish, who slits Jasmine's throat. Enraged at her death, Billa overpowers and kills everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, in Russia, Dimitri is having an auction of his weapons, and Koti is present with him. He shows his factory in his computer via a series of webcams and much to everyone's shock, Billa is seen destroying his factory in Georgia. He also sees his consignment train go off course. He gets angered and kills Koti for not killing Billa, and he sets out himself to finish the task. The arms factory is destroyed by Billa and his friends. Dimitri arrives and follows his delivery train, when to his shock, the delivery train is blown by Billa, who would be waiting for him on his own helicopter. After an intense battle, Billa kills Dimitri. In the epilogue, Billa and Ranjith board a plane out of the country, and the loose threads (Sameera, Police and Lawyer) are eliminated by Billa's men.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith Kumar]] as David Billa\n* [[Parvathy Omanakuttan]] as Jasmine\n* [[Bruna Abdullah]] as Sameera\n* [[Sudhanshu Pandey]] as Abbasi\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Russian Arms dealer Dimitri\n* [[Yog Japee]] as Ranjith\n* [[Manoj K.

See John C. Skipper, ''Meredith Willson: The Unsinkable Music Man'' (Savas Publishing, 2015), p. 200</ref> Charlie Cowell and other traveling salesmen debate whether innovations are making their profession more difficult. \"Professor\" Harold Hill is raised as one whose sales skills make him immune from such changes (\"Rock Island\"). Charlie says that Hill is a [[confidence trick|con man]] who promises to form boys marching bands then skips town after taking payments for instruments and uniforms. Upon the train's arrival in River City, Iowa, a passenger leaves the train with a suitcase labeled \"Professor Harold Hill\".\n\nAfter townspeople of River City describe their reserved, \"chip-on-the-shoulder attitude\" (\"[[Iowa Stubborn]]\"), Harold sees his old friend and [[shill]], Marcellus Washburn, who has \"gone legit\" and now lives in the town. Marcellus tells Harold that Marian Paroo, the librarian who gives piano lessons, is the only trained musician in town. He also informs Hill that a new [[pool table]] was just delivered to the town's local [[billiard parlor]], so to launch his scheme, Harold convinces River City parents of the \"trouble\" that can come from a pool table (\"[[Ya Got Trouble]]\"). Harold follows Marian home, attempting to flirt with her, but she ignores him. Marian gives a piano lesson to a little girl named Amaryllis while arguing with her widowed mother about her high \"standards where men are concerned\"; she mentions the man who followed her home (\"Piano Lesson/If You Don't Mind My Saying So\"). Marian's self-conscious 10-year-old brother Winthrop arrives home. Amaryllis, who secretly likes Winthrop but teases him about his lisp, asks Marian to whom she should say goodnight on the evening star, since she doesn't have a sweetheart. Marian tells her to just say goodnight to her \"someone\" (\"Goodnight, My Someone\").\n\nThe next day, Mayor Shinn and his overbearing wife Eulalie MacKecknie Shinn lead the festivities for [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] at the high school gym (\"[[Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean]]\") but are interrupted by a firecracker set off by troublemaker Tommy Djilas. Harold takes the stage and announces to the townspeople that he will prevent \"sin and corruption\" from the pool table by forming a boys' band (\"Ya Got Trouble [reprise]/[[Seventy-Six Trombones]]\"). Mayor Shinn, who owns the billiard parlor, tells the bickering school board to get Harold's credentials, but Harold gets them to sing as a [[Barbershop Quartet]] to distract them (\"Ice Cream/Sincere\"). Harold also sets up Zaneeta, the mayor's eldest daughter, with Tommy, and persuades Tommy to work as his assistant. After another rejection by Marian, Harold is determined to win her (\"The Sadder But Wiser Girl\"). The town ladies are very excited about the band and the ladies' dance committee that Harold plans to form. He mentions Marian, and they imply (falsely, it turns out) that she had an affair with a now-deceased miser, who willed the library building to the town but left all the books to Marian. They warn Harold that she advocates \"dirty books\" by \"[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais|Rabelais]] and [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]]\" (\"Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little\"). The school board arrives to review Harold's credentials, but he leads them in song and slips away (\"[[Goodnight, Ladies]]\").\n\nThe next day, Harold walks into the library to woo Marian in earnest (\"Marian the Librarian\"). For a moment, she forgets her decorum and dances with Harold and the teenagers. Harold kisses her; when she tries to slap him, she accidentally hits Tommy instead. With Tommy's help, Harold signs up all the boys in town to be in his band, including Winthrop. Mrs. Paroo likes Harold and tries to find out why Marian is not interested. Marian describes her ideal man (\"My White Knight\"). She sets out to give Mayor Shinn evidence against Harold that she found in the ''Indiana State Educational Journal'', but they are interrupted by the arrival of the [[History of Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo]] wagon, which delivers the band instruments (\"The Wells Fargo Wagon\"). When Winthrop forgets to be shy and self-conscious because he is so happy about his new [[cornet]], Marian begins to see Harold in a new light. She tears the incriminating page out of the Journal before giving the book to Mayor Shinn.\n\n===Act II===\nThe ladies rehearse their classical dance in the school gym while the school board practices their quartet (\"It's You\") for the [[ice cream social]]. Marcellus and the town's teenagers interrupt the ladies' practice, taking over the gym as they dance (\"[[Shipoopi]]\"). Harold grabs Marian to dance with her, and all the teenagers join in. Regarding Winthrop's cornet, Marian later questions Harold about his claim that \"you don't have to bother with the [[Musical note|note]]s\". He explains that this is what he calls \"The Think System\", and he arranges to call on Marian to discuss it. The town ladies ask Marian to join their dance committee, since she was \"so dear dancing the Shipoopi\" with Professor Hill (\"Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little\" [Reprise]). They have reversed their opinions about her books, and they eagerly tell her that \"the Professor told us to read those books, and we simply adored them all!\"\n\nThat night, the school board tries to collect Harold's credentials again, but he gets them to sing again and slips away (\"Lida Rose\"). Marian, meanwhile, is sitting on her front porch thinking of Harold (\"Will I Ever Tell You?\"). Winthrop returns home after spending time with Harold and tells Marian and Mrs. Paroo about Harold's hometown (\"Gary, Indiana\"). As Marian waits alone for Harold, traveling salesman Charlie Cowell enters with evidence against Harold, hoping to tell Mayor Shinn. He only has a few minutes before his train leaves, but stops to flirt with Marian. She delays him so he won't have time to deliver the evidence, eventually kissing him. As the train whistle blows, she pushes him away. Charlie angrily tells Marian that Harold has a girl in \"every county in Illinois, and he's taken it from every one of them&nbsp;&ndash; and that's 102 counties!\"\n\nHarold arrives, and after he reminds her of the untrue rumors he's heard about her, she convinces herself that Charlie invented everything he told her. They agree to meet at the footbridge, where Marian tells him the difference he's made in her life (\"[[Till There Was You]]\"). Marcellus interrupts and tells Harold that the uniforms have arrived. He urges Harold to take the money and run, but Harold refuses to leave, insisting, \"I've come up through the ranks... and I'm not resigning without my commission\". He returns to Marian, who tells him that she's known since three days after he arrived that he is a fraud. (Harold earlier claimed to have graduated from the Gary Conservatory in 1905, but Gary, Indiana, was not founded until 1906.) Because she loves him, she gives him the incriminating page out of the ''Indiana State Educational Journal''. She leaves, promising to see him later at the Sociable. With his schemes for the boys' band and Marian proceeding even better than planned, Harold confidently sings \"Seventy-Six Trombones\". As he overhears Marian singing \"Goodnight My Someone\", Harold suddenly realizes that he is in love with Marian; he and Marian sing a snatch of each other's songs.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie Cowell, who has missed his train, arrives at the ice cream social and denounces Harold Hill as a fraud. The townspeople begin an agitated search for Harold. Winthrop is heartbroken and tells Harold that he wishes Harold never came to River City. But Marian tells Winthrop that she believes everything Harold ever said, for it did come true in the way every kid in town talked and acted that summer. She and Winthrop urge Harold to get away. He chooses to stay and tells Marian that he never really fell in love until he met her (\"Till There Was You\" [Reprise]). The constable then handcuffs Harold and leads him away.\n\nMayor Shinn leads a meeting in the high school gym to decide what to do with Harold, asking, \"Where's the band? Where's the band?\"  Marian defends Harold. Tommy enters as a drum major, followed by the kids in uniform with their instruments. Marian urges Harold to lead the River City Boys' Band in [[Beethoven]]'s [[Minuet WoO 10, No. 2 (Beethoven)|Minuet in G]]. Despite the boys' limited musical ability, the parents in the audience are nonetheless enraptured by the sight of their children playing music. Even Mayor Shinn is won over, and, as the townspeople cheer, Harold is released into Marian's arms (\"Finale\").\n\n==Music==\n\n===Musical numbers===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I                                                            \n* \"Rock Island\" \u2013 Charlie and Salesmen\n* \"[[Iowa Stubborn]]\" \u2013 Townspeople\n* \"[[Ya Got Trouble|(Ya Got) Trouble]]\" \u2013 Harold Hill and Townspeople\n* \"Piano Lesson\" \u2013 Marian, Mrs. Paroo and Amaryllis\n* \"Goodnight, My Someone\" \u2013 Marian\n* \"[[Seventy-Six Trombones]]\" \u2013 Harold, Boys and Girls\n* \"Sincere\" \u2013 Barbershop quartet (Olin, Oliver, Ewart, Jacey)\n* \"The Sadder-But-Wiser Girl\" \u2013 Harold and Marcellus\n* \"Pickalittle (Talk-a-Little)\" <!--the title is \"Pickalittle\", per the ibdb; Suskin & Green and other sources add the \"Talk-a-Little\" -->\u2013 Eulalie, Maud, Ethel, Alma, Mrs. Squires and Ladies of River City\n* \"[[Goodnight, Ladies]]\" \u2013 Quartet\n* \"Marian The Librarian\" \u2013 Harold, Boys and Girls\n* \"My White Knight\" \u2013 Marian\n* \"The Wells Fargo Wagon\" \u2013 Winthrop and Townspeople\n{{col-break}}\n\n; Act II\n* \"It's You\" \u2013 The Quartet, Eulalie, Maud, Ethel, Alma and Mrs. Squires\n* \"[[Shipoopi]]\" \u2013 Marcellus, Harold, Marian and townspeople\n* \"Pickalittle (Talk-a-Little)\" (reprise) \u2013 Eulalie, Maud, Ethel, Alma, Mrs. Squires and Ladies\n* \"Lida Rose\" \u2013 Quartet\n* \"Will I Ever Tell You\" \u2013 Marian\n* \"Gary, Indiana\" \u2013 Winthrop, Mrs. Paroo, Marian\n* \"It's You\" (reprise) \u2013 Townspeople, Boys and Girls\n* \"[[Till There Was You]]\" \u2013 Marian, Harold\n* \"Seventy-six Trombones/Goodnight, My Someone\" (reprise) \u2013 Harold and Marian\n* \"Till There Was You\" (reprise) \u2013 Harold\n* \"Finale\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n''Notes:''<br>\nAs this musical concerns a [[marching band]], Willson's orchestration for several of the numbers includes band instruments.<ref>[http://www.mtishows.com/show_detail.asp?showid=000053 \"''The Music Man''\"], MTI Enterprises, accessed October 11, 2013</ref><ref>[http://guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_m/music_man.htm \"''The Music Man''\"], ''The Guide to Musical Theatre'', showing a reduced orchestra arrangement, accessed October 11, 2013</ref>\n\n\"Lida Rose\" and \"Will I Ever Tell You\", sung first separately and then simultaneously, are examples of Broadway counterpoint (songs with separate lyrics and separate melodies that harmonize and are designed to be sung together). Similarly, \"Pickalittle\" and \"Good Night Ladies\" are also sung first separately, and then in counterpoint.  Willson's counterpoint, along with two counterpoint song pairs from [[Irving Berlin]] musicals, are lampooned in the 1959 musical ''[[Little Mary Sunshine]]'', where ''three'' counterpoint songs are combined: \"Playing Croquet,\" \"Swinging\" and \"How Do You Do?.\"  \"Goodnight, My Someone\" is the same tune, in waltz time, as the march-tempo \"Seventy-six Trombones\".<ref>{{cite book|author=John C.

The town is based in large part on Willson's birthplace, [[Mason City, Iowa]], and many of the musical's characters are based on people that Willson observed in the town.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. The \"river\" in River City is probably the [[Mississippi River]] near [[Davenport, Iowa]]: the Rock Island conductor's announcing \"River City, Iowa! Cigarettes illegal in this state\" implies crossing the Mississippi from [[Rock Island, Illinois]], into Iowa. The year 1912 was a time of relative innocence, as recalled in 1957 after two world wars, the [[Great Depression]] and the arrival of [[atomic weapons]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe musical includes numerous references to popular culture of the time. For example, in making his pitch, Harold Hill lists popular musicians and composers: [[Patrick Gilmore|Gilmore]], [[Patrick Conway|Pat Conway]], [[Giuseppe Creatore]], [[W.C. Handy]] and [[John Philip Sousa]].<ref>[http://www.doggedresearch.com/wilson/glossary.htm Wilson].

The overture of ''The Music Man'' drives off with a couple of good, shrill whistles and a heave-ho blast from half the brass in the pit, with the heartier trombonists lurching to their feet in a blare of enthusiasm. The curtain sails up to disclose the most energetic engine on the Rock Island Railroad (circa 1912) hurtling across the proscenium with real smoke pouring out of its smokestack and real steam rolling along the rails\".<ref name=Suskin/> Kerr called Preston \"indefatigable: he's got zest and gusto and a great big grin for another slam-bang march tune\".<ref name=Suskin/> Robert Coleman of the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' wrote that the producer \"made a 10-strike in landing Robert Preston for the title role\", stating that Preston \"paces the piece dynamically, acts ingratiatingly, sings as if he'd been doing it all his life, and offers steps that would score on the cards of dance judges\".<ref name=Suskin/>\n\nFrank Aston of the ''[[New York World-Telegram|New York World-Telegram and Sun]]'' declared \"It deserves to run at least a decade\", especially praising Barbara Cook's performance as Marian: \"If all our stack-tenders looked, sang, danced, and acted like Miss Barbara, this nation's book learning would be overwhelming\".<ref name=Suskin/> John Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' pronounced ''The Music Man'' \"one of the few great musical comedies of the last 26 years\", stating that ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (1931) \"set a standard for fun and invention which has seldom been reached.

At some point during the second Broadway revival, O'Brien was approached about playing the role of Harold Hill for a brief run, but he ultimately could not fit it into his schedule. He says, on the DVD commentary track for the aforementioned ''Simpsons'' episode, that it was the hardest choice he's ever had to make professionally, because ''The Music Man'' is one of his favorites. O'Brien did, however, as host of the [[58th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards|2006 Emmy Awards]], sing a parody version of \"Ya Got Trouble\" in his opening monologue targeting [[NBC]] and their slide in the ratings.\n\nThe television program ''[[Family Guy]]'' has parodied the musical at least three times. In the episode \"[[Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows]]\", Lois chastises Brian's high standards in a spoof of \"Piano Lesson\". In another episode, \"[[Patriot Games (Family Guy)|Patriot Games]]\", Peter showboats after scoring a touchdown by leading a stadium full of people in a rendition of \"[[Shipoopi]]\", complete with choreography from the film. In Episode 22 of ''[[Boston Legal]]'', \"Men to Boys\", Alan Shore sings a parody of the song \"Trouble\" to convince patrons of a restaurant not to eat the salmon.

The plot concerns [[confidence trick|con man]] Harold Hill, who poses as a boys' band organizer and leader and sells band instruments and uniforms to na\u00efve [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] townsfolk, promising to train the members of the new band. Harold is no musician, however, and plans to skip town without giving any music lessons. Prim librarian and piano teacher Marian sees through him, but when Harold helps her younger brother overcome his lisp and social awkwardness, Marian begins to fall in love. Harold risks being caught to win her.\n\nIn 1957, the show became a hit on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], winning five [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical, and running for 1,375 performances.<ref name=Kenrick2010/> The [[cast album]] won the first [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album]] and spent 245 weeks on the Billboard charts. The show's success led to revivals, including a long-running 2000 Broadway revival, a popular [[The Music Man (1962 film)|1962 film adaptation]] and a 2003 [[The Music Man (2003 film)|television adaptation]].

See John C. Skipper, ''Meredith Willson: The Unsinkable Music Man'' (Savas Publishing, 2015), p. 200</ref> Charlie Cowell and other traveling salesmen debate whether innovations are making their profession more difficult. \"Professor\" Harold Hill is raised as one whose sales skills make him immune from such changes (\"Rock Island\"). Charlie says that Hill is a [[confidence trick|con man]] who promises to form boys marching bands then skips town after taking payments for instruments and uniforms. Upon the train's arrival in River City, Iowa, a passenger leaves the train with a suitcase labeled \"Professor Harold Hill\".\n\nAfter townspeople of River City describe their reserved, \"chip-on-the-shoulder attitude\" (\"[[Iowa Stubborn]]\"), Harold sees his old friend and [[shill]], Marcellus Washburn, who has \"gone legit\" and now lives in the town. Marcellus tells Harold that Marian Paroo, the librarian who gives piano lessons, is the only trained musician in town. He also informs Hill that a new [[pool table]] was just delivered to the town's local [[billiard parlor]], so to launch his scheme, Harold convinces River City parents of the \"trouble\" that can come from a pool table (\"[[Ya Got Trouble]]\"). Harold follows Marian home, attempting to flirt with her, but she ignores him. Marian gives a piano lesson to a little girl named Amaryllis while arguing with her widowed mother about her high \"standards where men are concerned\"; she mentions the man who followed her home (\"Piano Lesson/If You Don't Mind My Saying So\"). Marian's self-conscious 10-year-old brother Winthrop arrives home. Amaryllis, who secretly likes Winthrop but teases him about his lisp, asks Marian to whom she should say goodnight on the evening star, since she doesn't have a sweetheart. Marian tells her to just say goodnight to her \"someone\" (\"Goodnight, My Someone\").\n\nThe next day, Mayor Shinn and his overbearing wife Eulalie MacKecknie Shinn lead the festivities for [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] at the high school gym (\"[[Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean]]\") but are interrupted by a firecracker set off by troublemaker Tommy Djilas. Harold takes the stage and announces to the townspeople that he will prevent \"sin and corruption\" from the pool table by forming a boys' band (\"Ya Got Trouble [reprise]/[[Seventy-Six Trombones]]\"). Mayor Shinn, who owns the billiard parlor, tells the bickering school board to get Harold's credentials, but Harold gets them to sing as a [[Barbershop Quartet]] to distract them (\"Ice Cream/Sincere\"). Harold also sets up Zaneeta, the mayor's eldest daughter, with Tommy, and persuades Tommy to work as his assistant. After another rejection by Marian, Harold is determined to win her (\"The Sadder But Wiser Girl\"). The town ladies are very excited about the band and the ladies' dance committee that Harold plans to form. He mentions Marian, and they imply (falsely, it turns out) that she had an affair with a now-deceased miser, who willed the library building to the town but left all the books to Marian. They warn Harold that she advocates \"dirty books\" by \"[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais|Rabelais]] and [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]]\" (\"Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little\"). The school board arrives to review Harold's credentials, but he leads them in song and slips away (\"[[Goodnight, Ladies]]\").\n\nThe next day, Harold walks into the library to woo Marian in earnest (\"Marian the Librarian\"). For a moment, she forgets her decorum and dances with Harold and the teenagers. Harold kisses her; when she tries to slap him, she accidentally hits Tommy instead. With Tommy's help, Harold signs up all the boys in town to be in his band, including Winthrop. Mrs. Paroo likes Harold and tries to find out why Marian is not interested. Marian describes her ideal man (\"My White Knight\"). She sets out to give Mayor Shinn evidence against Harold that she found in the ''Indiana State Educational Journal'', but they are interrupted by the arrival of the [[History of Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo]] wagon, which delivers the band instruments (\"The Wells Fargo Wagon\"). When Winthrop forgets to be shy and self-conscious because he is so happy about his new [[cornet]], Marian begins to see Harold in a new light. She tears the incriminating page out of the Journal before giving the book to Mayor Shinn.\n\n===Act II===\nThe ladies rehearse their classical dance in the school gym while the school board practices their quartet (\"It's You\") for the [[ice cream social]]. Marcellus and the town's teenagers interrupt the ladies' practice, taking over the gym as they dance (\"[[Shipoopi]]\"). Harold grabs Marian to dance with her, and all the teenagers join in. Regarding Winthrop's cornet, Marian later questions Harold about his claim that \"you don't have to bother with the [[Musical note|note]]s\". He explains that this is what he calls \"The Think System\", and he arranges to call on Marian to discuss it. The town ladies ask Marian to join their dance committee, since she was \"so dear dancing the Shipoopi\" with Professor Hill (\"Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little\" [Reprise]). They have reversed their opinions about her books, and they eagerly tell her that \"the Professor told us to read those books, and we simply adored them all!\"\n\nThat night, the school board tries to collect Harold's credentials again, but he gets them to sing again and slips away (\"Lida Rose\"). Marian, meanwhile, is sitting on her front porch thinking of Harold (\"Will I Ever Tell You?\"). Winthrop returns home after spending time with Harold and tells Marian and Mrs. Paroo about Harold's hometown (\"Gary, Indiana\"). As Marian waits alone for Harold, traveling salesman Charlie Cowell enters with evidence against Harold, hoping to tell Mayor Shinn. He only has a few minutes before his train leaves, but stops to flirt with Marian. She delays him so he won't have time to deliver the evidence, eventually kissing him. As the train whistle blows, she pushes him away. Charlie angrily tells Marian that Harold has a girl in \"every county in Illinois, and he's taken it from every one of them&nbsp;&ndash; and that's 102 counties!\"\n\nHarold arrives, and after he reminds her of the untrue rumors he's heard about her, she convinces herself that Charlie invented everything he told her. They agree to meet at the footbridge, where Marian tells him the difference he's made in her life (\"[[Till There Was You]]\"). Marcellus interrupts and tells Harold that the uniforms have arrived. He urges Harold to take the money and run, but Harold refuses to leave, insisting, \"I've come up through the ranks... and I'm not resigning without my commission\". He returns to Marian, who tells him that she's known since three days after he arrived that he is a fraud. (Harold earlier claimed to have graduated from the Gary Conservatory in 1905, but Gary, Indiana, was not founded until 1906.) Because she loves him, she gives him the incriminating page out of the ''Indiana State Educational Journal''. She leaves, promising to see him later at the Sociable. With his schemes for the boys' band and Marian proceeding even better than planned, Harold confidently sings \"Seventy-Six Trombones\". As he overhears Marian singing \"Goodnight My Someone\", Harold suddenly realizes that he is in love with Marian; he and Marian sing a snatch of each other's songs.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie Cowell, who has missed his train, arrives at the ice cream social and denounces Harold Hill as a fraud. The townspeople begin an agitated search for Harold. Winthrop is heartbroken and tells Harold that he wishes Harold never came to River City. But Marian tells Winthrop that she believes everything Harold ever said, for it did come true in the way every kid in town talked and acted that summer. She and Winthrop urge Harold to get away. He chooses to stay and tells Marian that he never really fell in love until he met her (\"Till There Was You\" [Reprise]). The constable then handcuffs Harold and leads him away.\n\nMayor Shinn leads a meeting in the high school gym to decide what to do with Harold, asking, \"Where's the band? Where's the band?\"  Marian defends Harold. Tommy enters as a drum major, followed by the kids in uniform with their instruments.

Similarly, \"Pickalittle\" and \"Good Night Ladies\" are also sung first separately, and then in counterpoint.  Willson's counterpoint, along with two counterpoint song pairs from [[Irving Berlin]] musicals, are lampooned in the 1959 musical ''[[Little Mary Sunshine]]'', where ''three'' counterpoint songs are combined: \"Playing Croquet,\" \"Swinging\" and \"How Do You Do?.\"  \"Goodnight, My Someone\" is the same tune, in waltz time, as the march-tempo \"Seventy-six Trombones\".<ref>{{cite book|author=John C.

The town is based in large part on Willson's birthplace, [[Mason City, Iowa]], and many of the musical's characters are based on people that Willson observed in the town.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. The \"river\" in River City is probably the [[Mississippi River]] near [[Davenport, Iowa]]: the Rock Island conductor's announcing \"River City, Iowa! Cigarettes illegal in this state\" implies crossing the Mississippi from [[Rock Island, Illinois]], into Iowa. The year 1912 was a time of relative innocence, as recalled in 1957 after two world wars, the [[Great Depression]] and the arrival of [[atomic weapons]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe musical includes numerous references to popular culture of the time. For example, in making his pitch, Harold Hill lists popular musicians and composers: [[Patrick Gilmore|Gilmore]], [[Patrick Conway|Pat Conway]], [[Giuseppe Creatore]], [[W.C. Handy]] and [[John Philip Sousa]].<ref>[http://www.doggedresearch.com/wilson/glossary.htm Wilson].

''[[The New York Times]]'', December 20, 1957, accessed May 1, 2010</ref>\n\nWalter Kerr of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune]]'' glowingly described the opening scene of the musical: \"It's the beat that does it. The overture of ''The Music Man'' drives off with a couple of good, shrill whistles and a heave-ho blast from half the brass in the pit, with the heartier trombonists lurching to their feet in a blare of enthusiasm. The curtain sails up to disclose the most energetic engine on the Rock Island Railroad (circa 1912) hurtling across the proscenium with real smoke pouring out of its smokestack and real steam rolling along the rails\".<ref name=Suskin/> Kerr called Preston \"indefatigable: he's got zest and gusto and a great big grin for another slam-bang march tune\".<ref name=Suskin/> Robert Coleman of the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' wrote that the producer \"made a 10-strike in landing Robert Preston for the title role\", stating that Preston \"paces the piece dynamically, acts ingratiatingly, sings as if he'd been doing it all his life, and offers steps that would score on the cards of dance judges\".<ref name=Suskin/>\n\nFrank Aston of the ''[[New York World-Telegram|New York World-Telegram and Sun]]'' declared \"It deserves to run at least a decade\", especially praising Barbara Cook's performance as Marian: \"If all our stack-tenders looked, sang, danced, and acted like Miss Barbara, this nation's book learning would be overwhelming\".<ref name=Suskin/> John Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' pronounced ''The Music Man'' \"one of the few great musical comedies of the last 26 years\", stating that ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (1931) \"set a standard for fun and invention which has seldom been reached. Its equal arrived in 1950 \u2013 ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'' \u2013 and I would say that ''The Music Man'' ranks with these two\".<ref name=Suskin/> In the ''[[New York Journal American|Journal-American]]'', John McClain deemed the show \"a whopping hit.

At some point during the second Broadway revival, O'Brien was approached about playing the role of Harold Hill for a brief run, but he ultimately could not fit it into his schedule. He says, on the DVD commentary track for the aforementioned ''Simpsons'' episode, that it was the hardest choice he's ever had to make professionally, because ''The Music Man'' is one of his favorites. O'Brien did, however, as host of the [[58th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards|2006 Emmy Awards]], sing a parody version of \"Ya Got Trouble\" in his opening monologue targeting [[NBC]] and their slide in the ratings.\n\nThe television program ''[[Family Guy]]'' has parodied the musical at least three times. In the episode \"[[Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows]]\", Lois chastises Brian's high standards in a spoof of \"Piano Lesson\". In another episode, \"[[Patriot Games (Family Guy)|Patriot Games]]\", Peter showboats after scoring a touchdown by leading a stadium full of people in a rendition of \"[[Shipoopi]]\", complete with choreography from the film. In Episode 22 of ''[[Boston Legal]]'', \"Men to Boys\", Alan Shore sings a parody of the song \"Trouble\" to convince patrons of a restaurant not to eat the salmon.  Several ''Music Man'' songs were used in ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', for example in the season 2 episode \"Sex, Lies and Politics\" in which lawyer [[John Cage (character)|John Cage]] spurs the jury into singing \"Ya Got Trouble\" with him.<ref>[http://allymcbeal.tktv.net/music2.html/ List of music by episode of Ally McBeal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226200924/http://allymcbeal.tktv.net/music2.html |date=2009-02-26 }}, accessed April 25, 2010</ref>  Season 2 Episode 15 (2012), \"The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000\", of the TV show ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'', makes numerous allusions to ''The Music Man'', including a song based on \"Ya Got Trouble\".<ref>Schenkel, Katie.

I-495 is widely known as the '''Capital Beltway''', or simply '''the Beltway''', especially when the context of Washington, D.C., is clear. It is the basis of the phrase \"[[inside the Beltway]]\", used when referring to issues dealing with American [[government]] and [[politics]]. [[Interstate 95|I-95]] utilizes the southern and eastern half of the Capital Beltway to circumnavigate Washington, D.C., and is [[concurrency (road)|cosigned]] with I-495 along that portion.\n\nThis [[loop road|circumferential roadway]] is located not only in the states of Virginia and Maryland, but also crosses briefly through the District of Columbia, near the western end of the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]].  The Beltway passes through [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] and [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] in Maryland, and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in Virginia.\n\nThe [[Cabin John Parkway]], a short connector between I-495 and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] near the Potomac River along the Maryland\u2013Virginia border, is considered an Interstate [[highway spur|spur]] (I-495X) by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]].\n\n==Route description==\nExcept for the westernmost part of Woodrow Wilson Bridge south of downtown Washington (the water below is considered part of the District of Columbia), the Capital Beltway encircles [[Washington, D.C.]], in adjacent [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. The two directions of travel, [[clockwise]] and [[counterclockwise]] (looking at a map), have become known respectively as the \"'''Inner Loop'''\" and the \"'''Outer Loop'''\". The route descriptions below follow the direction of the Outer Loop, starting at the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, south of Washington.\n\n[[File:2018-10-31 14 23 17 Signs for Interstate 495 and the Capital Beltway along eastbound U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard) just west of Virginia State Route 650 (Gallows Road) in Woodburn, Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|120px|left|I-495/Capital Beltway signage in Virginia]]\nMost Beltway interchanges provide access to Washington, with [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]] and [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|I-295]] from the south, [[Interstate 66|I-66]] from the west, and [[U.S. Route 50|US 50]] from both the west and the east among the most frequently used. More scenic routes from the Beltway into the District are offered by the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] along the Virginia side of the Potomac, the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Maryland side of the river, and the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]], approaching Washington from the northeast.\n\nOriginally, the entire Beltway was simply I-495, and [[Interstate 95|I-95]] was planned to serve downtown Washington, D.C., from the south and north, intersecting the Beltway in Virginia and in Maryland.  However, environmental litigation stopped completion of this plan, and the built portion of I-95 inside the Beltway from the south northward into downtown Washington was redesignated [[Interstate 395 (Virginia\u2013District of Columbia)|I-395]] in 1977.  The small built portion from the north was converted into a park-and-ride lot. I-95 was then rerouted (and so signed) along the eastern side of the Beltway, with the I-495 designation left only along the western side.  In 1989, the I-495 designation was returned to the eastern portion as well, with the highway co-signed as I-95 and I-495 along this route.\n\n===District of Columbia===\n[[File:2007 04 25 - WWB 44.JPG|left|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] carrying I-95/I-495 over the [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]] and [[Oxon Hill, Maryland]] (2007)]]\nThe Beltway (here I-95 and I-495 together), four lanes in each direction, travels over the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[estuary|tidal]] [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].

After crossing the Potomac, I-95/I-495 narrows to eight lanes with two local and two express lanes in each direction, and immediately meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|Interstate 295]], known as the Anacostia Freeway, a route that serves downtown [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to the north, connecting in Washington to [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Interstate 695]]. This large interchange also connects to National Harbor Boulevard which links the National Harbor with the Beltway and I-295. The highway passes south of [[Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm]] and next intersects [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]] (Indian Head Highway) , a major north\u2013south route from southern D.C. to [[Indian Head, Maryland|Indian Head]] in [[Charles County, Maryland]], which also serves the town of Forest Heights to the north at another interconnected interchange.\n\nHeading eastward, the Beltway's (I-95/I-495) local\u2013express lane configuration ends before it interchanges with various local highways, including [[Maryland Route 5|MD 5]] and [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]] on either side of [[Andrews Air Force Base]], which the Beltway travels near its northern edge. (Both MD 5 and MD 4 extend westward into D.C., and southeastward into [[Southern Maryland]].) Past the MD 4 interchange, the Beltway turns north through [[Glenarden, Maryland|Glenarden]], interchanging with [[Maryland Route 202|MD 202]].\n\nThe Beltway then interchanges with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]]/unsigned [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|I-595]], a major highway from downtown Washington eastward to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, and the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] to Maryland's [[Eastern Shore, Maryland|Eastern Shore]]. Both US 50 and MD 450 (which interchanges with the Beltway slightly northward) provide access to the New Carrollton [[New Carrollton (Washington Metro)|Metro]], [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail, and [[Amtrak]] stations, and the [[New Carrollton, Maryland|New Carrollton]] area.\n[[File:Washington Beltway I-495.jpg|thumb|left|I-495/I-95 Northbound in Maryland, at the Rhode Island Ave. overpass]]\n\nTurning northwest, the Beltway then enters [[Greenbelt Park]], intersecting the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]] (B-W Parkway) in the northeastern edge of the park. Just after the B-W Parkway, I-95/I-495 passes an interchange with [[Maryland Route 201|MD 201]], which connects to the southern terminus of the B-W Parkway at US&nbsp;50 near the D.C. line. Now turned fully west, the Beltway runs through the northern edge of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]], interchanging with the access roadway for the [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]] [[Greenbelt (Washington Metro)|Metro]] and [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail stations, then [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]].\n\nBeyond the US 1 interchange, I-95 separates from I-495 at the College Park Interchange. I-495 continues west, alone, on the Capital Beltway, while I-95 turns northeast towards [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[New York, New York|New York City]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The interchange includes access to a [[Park and Ride]] lot which was originally paved as part of I-95's route within the Beltway.\n\nContinuing west from the College Park Interchange, I-495 crosses into [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], entering a heavily developed and populated area. Passing underneath [[Maryland Route 212|MD 212]] with no access, the route interchanges with [[Maryland Route 650|MD 650]] near the [[George Washington Cemetery]]. After bisecting [[Northwest Branch Park]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 193|MD 193]] and [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US 29]] south of [[Four Corners, Maryland|Four Corners]]; the two interchanges are little more than 1/2 mile apart. Southbound US 29 is the main route into downtown [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], continuing into Washington.\n\nSqueezing past [[Argyle Park]] and [[Sligo Creek Golf Course]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 97|MD 97]] northwest of Silver Spring, then follows an alignment formerly known as '''Rock Creek Parkway'''.<ref group=lower-alpha>Not the extant parkway in Rock Creek Park within D.C.</ref> The route twists along the alignment, through and around [[Rock Creek Park]], then interchanges with [[Maryland Route 185|MD 185]] near the [[National Naval Medical Center]]. Turning northwest, I-495 soon encounters the southern terminus of [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]], which extends northwestward to meet [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in [[Frederick, Maryland]].\n\n[[File:I495 MD 10 2005 165.JPG|left|thumb|I-270/I-495 split (October 2005)]]\nI-270 and I-495 split at a highly complex Y-junction, with two separate HOV connections to I-270's HOV lanes and separate ramps to and from [[Maryland Route 355|MD 355]] (formerly [[U.S. Route 240|US 240]]). The old Rock Creek Parkway alignment follows I-270 north, while I-495 turns west and enters the only other six-lane segment of the Beltway still in existence; significant levels of traffic exit onto I-270 north, leaving the six-lane segment west of the split adequate.\n[[File:2016-01-22 09 58 00 View west along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at a signed 50 mph left curve west of Exit 36 in North Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp curve on the outer loop of the Beltway at the interchange with I-270 Spur in North Bethesda]]\nInterchanging with Old Georgetown Road ([[Maryland Route 187|MD 187]]), I-495 soon meets the [[Interstate 270 Spur]], the other side of the I-270/I-495 triangle. I-495 joins I-270 Spur at a converging [[Interchange (road)#Full Y interchange|wye]] junction; Inner Loop traffic exits from itself at the southern terminus of I-270 Spur, while Outer Loop traffic crosses the spur and enters it from the right. The two carriageways of I-495 temporarily widen to five lanes each until the [[Maryland Route 190|MD 190]] and [[Cabin John Parkway]] interchanges.  (MD 190 provides access to the northwestern portion of Washington, D.C., and to the [[Potomac, Maryland|Potomac]] and [[Great Falls, Maryland]] areas of Maryland's [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], while the Cabin John Parkway extends to the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Potomac River.)\n\nAfter these interchanges, the Beltway then narrows to eight lanes again. Turning sharply to the west, I-495 meets the Clara Barton Parkway along the north side of the [[Potomac River]];  this parkway provides a scenic route eastward into the western part of Washington, and westward toward the Potomac River's [[Great Falls (Potomac River)|Great Falls]].  After this interchange, the Beltway soon crosses the [[Mather Gorge|Potomac Gorge]] into [[Virginia]] over the ten-lane [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]].\n[[File:2015-12-08 14 07 24 View northeast towards the American Legion Memorial Bridge (Interstate 495) connecting Montgomery County, Maryland and Fairfax County, Virginia from the south bank of the Potomac River.jpg|left|thumb|American Legion Memorial Bridge carrying the western section of the Beltway over the Potomac River (2015)]]\n\n===Virginia===\n{{See also|Virginia HOT lanes#495 Express Lanes}}\n\nImmediately after crossing into [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia, I-495 encounters the western terminus of the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] at a [[trumpet interchange]];  the Parkway provides a scenic route to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia, and downtown Washington.  The Beltway then continues south, next interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 193|VA 193]] south of [[Dranesville District Park]], then reaches the extensive triangle of interchanges between I-495, the [[Dulles Airport Access Road]], [[Virginia State Route 267|VA 267]], and [[Virginia State Route 123|VA 123]]. The eastbound Dulles Access Road here also provides access to I-66 for Outer Loop Beltway traffic.  The former interchange with the toll road (VA 267) is a directional interchange, while the latter is a cloverleaf; the entire complex occurs east of the [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]] business district.\n\nNow running south, the Beltway interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 7|VA 7]] (Leesburg Pike) east of Tysons Corner; passing [[Dunn Loring, Virginia|Dunn Loring]] to the east, I-495 soon reaches the complex interchange with [[Interstate 66]], which extends westward to [[I-81]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] near [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]], Virginia, and eastward to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and downtown Washington. In a similar design as the I-270/I-495 interchange, dedicated HOV connections exist between I-495 and I-66, with many reversible and other directional ramps providing the remaining connections. There is no access between the Outer Loop and eastbound I-66 at this interchange. Instead, Outer Loop traffic must use the eastbound [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] exit 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) to the north in order to reach I-66 East.<ref group=lower-alpha>If a driver gets onto westbound I-66 at the Leesburg Pike (SR&nbsp;7) entrance, the only choice for getting to northbound I-495 is to take I-66 west to the Nutley Street exit and then get on I-66 east. A similar situation occurs for going from the [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] at Chain Bridge Road ([[Virginia State Route 123|SR&nbsp;123]]) to southbound I-495, where it is assumed that the driver will know to continue along SR&nbsp;7 or SR&nbsp;123 directly to the Beltway.</ref> There are multiple ramps from I-66 east to the Inner Loop, with one ramp exiting from the left side of I-66 east and the other exiting from the right. The [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] leads to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], which then changes over to the [[Dulles Greenway]] and ends at [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]].\n\nSouth of the I-66 interchange, the Beltway crosses under [[U.S. Route 29 in Virginia|US 29]] and [[Virginia State Route 237|VA 237]] with no access, then encounters a large braided interchange between I-495, [[U.S. Route 50 in Virginia|US 50]], and two local roads; the direct interchange between I-495 and US 50 is a full cloverleaf, while the braided local interchanges between I-495, US 50, and the local roads are modified [[SPUI]]s.

The first section of the {{convert|64|mi|km|adj=on}} long Beltway (including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge|Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]]) was opened on December 21, 1961; the highway was completed on August 17, 1964.\n\nOriginally designated I-495, in 1977 the eastern portion of the Beltway was re-designated [[Interstate 95|I-95]] when a proposed alignment of I-95 from [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., through [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] to I-495 was canceled. Motorists never fully adjusted to the two halves of the Beltway having different numbers. According to Ron Shaffer of the ''Washington Post'',\n\n{{quote|There were signs stating that to continue on the Beltway, you had to get off at the next exit, when all you really had to do was keep going straight.

This parlance too has led to its own confusion, with unfamiliar motorists imagining two separate, distinct highway alignments, one some distance inside the other. At entrance ramps to the Beltway and on the on-highway signage, \"Inner Loop\" and \"Outer Loop\" shields are posted in conjunction with the route marker shields, although the terms are not emphasized in signage.\n\nThe Beltway was originally envisioned as primarily a bypass for long-distance eastern seaboard traffic to avoid driving directly through Washington. However, the explosive growth both of housing and business in the Washington suburbs following the Beltway's completion quickly made the Beltway the area's \"main street\" for local traffic as well. Numerous large shopping malls, community colleges, sports and concert stadiums, and corporate employment centers were purposely built adjacent to the Beltway, and these added greatly to the traffic, as has the passenger growth of regional airports accessed by the Beltway. The formerly more affordable price of housing in Southern Maryland versus [[Northern Virginia]], also led tens of thousands of commuters to live in Southern Maryland and commute on the Beltway to Virginia. The newer [[Fairfax County Parkway]] in the 1990s helped ease some traffic on the Virginia beltway; however, various proposals to build another complete [[Washington Outer Beltway|outer beltway]] in the outer suburbs has not gotten off the ground, because local governments in Maryland object to building additional [[Potomac River]] crossings as well as destroying protected \"open space\" and creating [[suburban sprawl|sprawl]].\n\n===College Park Interchange===\n[[File:College Park Interchange.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the College Park Interchange]]\n[[File:2019-06-03 11 53 32 View north along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway at the split between Interstate 95 North towards Baltimore and Interstate 495 West towards Silver Spring in Beltsville, Prince Georges County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The I-95/I-495 split at College Park, Maryland]]\nThe College Park Interchange is the informal name for the northern interchange between I-95 and I-495 in College Park. The interchange was partially opened, along with the connecting segment of I-95, in 1971, completing I-95 between the Baltimore Beltway and the Capital Beltway. As originally planned, it was designed with the idea that mainline I-95 through traffic would continue straight through the interchange and south into [[Washington D.C.]] as the [[Northeast Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|Northeast Freeway]], joining the [[North Central Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|North Central Freeway]] within D.C. and running south towards the central business district. When the D.C. government canceled its segment of I-95 in 1977, I-95 was rerouted onto the eastern half of the Capital Beltway, which lost its designation as I-495 (this was restored in 1989, forming a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] of I-95 and I-495 on the eastern half). As a result of this rerouting, the interchange was placed under considerable pressure to cater for a traffic flow that it was not designed to handle.\n\nOriginally, travelers from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop had to traverse the one-lane cloverleaf ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange; after exiting the ramp, traffic then had to weave through Inner Loop traffic headed for [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]]. This unsafe condition was rectified by November 1986, when the flyover from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop was constructed for I-95 southbound through traffic; the existing one-lane cloverleaf ramp was retained for access to the new C-D lane on the Inner Loop within the US 1 interchange, to segregate through traffic from southbound I-95 and local traffic for US 1. The stump end of the interchange was also modified into its present configuration, and the [[Park and Ride]] was built.\n\n===Traffic congestion===\nDespite numerous widening projects during its history, heavy traffic on the Beltway is a continuing problem. The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]]\u2014where eight lanes were squeezed into six\u2014was particularly onerous, with miles-long backups daily during commuter rush hours and on heavily traveled weekends. Relief for this bottleneck came on May 30, 2008, when the 12-lane replacement bridge opened to traffic in both directions (the six-lane span carrying Outer Loop traffic had opened in June 2006). Two of the lanes on the Wilson are being held in reserve  for future use as bus rapid transit or rail transit.\n\n[[File:2019-05-29 17 54 50 View south along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at Exit 57A (Interstate 95 South, Richmond) along the edge of North Springfield and Springfield in Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|left|View south along I-495 approaching the Springfield Interchange in Springfield, Virginia]]\nTwo intersections on the Capital Beltway are ranked in the top 20 on a study of the \"worst bottlenecks in the nation.\" They are the I-495 at [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]] interchange in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], ranked third overall, which receives 760,425 cars daily, and the College Park Interchange in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], ranked 11th, with 340,125 cars. The [[Springfield Interchange]], where [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|I-395]], I-95, and I-495 meet, was previously ranked fifth worst in the nation, but recent improvements have taken it off the top 20. Local commuters refer to the Springfield Interchange as \"The Mixing Bowl,\" although this designation is reserved by highway officials for the even more complicated [[Pentagon road network|interchange]] complex adjacent to [[The Pentagon]] on the original [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] (currently better-known as [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]]) at [[Virginia State Route 27|State Route 27]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]].\n\nIn April 2005, the [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] signed an agreement with two private companies to build [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes on the stretch of the Beltway between Springfield and Georgetown Pike.  Construction began in 2008. Maryland officials are considering such lanes on their segment of the Beltway, as well as other major commuter highways in the state. Locals who disapprove of these projects have nicknamed them \"[[Lexus]] Lanes\" because of the potential high price for using the lanes in exchange for bypassing congestion. These new lanes are one stage of a controversial project to widen the beltway, with the second stage involving widening the beltway to 12 lanes; opponents have called for various alternatives to this project (as well as the controversial [[Maryland Route 200|Intercounty Connector]] project) which would divert many vehicles off the northern beltway. The [[Maryland Transit Administration]]'s proposed [[Purple Line (Maryland)|Purple Line]] light rail transit line is just one example.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |title = The Beltway |publisher = Coalition for Smarter Growth |accessdate = August 24, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091220004753/http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |archive-date = December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Beltway has been improved since it opened. The American Legion Bridge was expanded by two lanes. HOV lanes were added between River Road and the I-270 Spur in Montgomery County, Maryland. The interchange between I-95 and the Beltway in Prince George's County, Maryland was originally designed to be a cloverleaf to allow I-95 to extend southward toward the District of Columbia. After I-95 was realigned onto the Beltway, a flyover ramp was built to allow I-95 through traffic to have two high-speed lanes. The interchange between U.S. Route 50 and I-95/I-495 in Prince George's County, Maryland was upgraded from a simple cloverleaf to a hybrid turbine interchange. In the Beltway's original configuration, I-295 and Indian Head Highway had separate interchanges. As a result, north-south traffic between I-295 and Indian Head Highway was forced to merge onto a congested section of the Beltway for approximately one mile. As a congestion relief measure, I-295 was extended over the Beltway and continued parallel to it so that the two highways were directly connected independent of the beltway. However, these interchanges were redesigned and rebuilt to accommodate the expansion of the Wilson Bridge and the construction of dedicated ramps to National Harbor.\n\nIn January 2018, Maryland State Democratic Sen. [[Joanne C. Benson|Joanne Benson]] of Prince George's County proposed legislation (Senate Bill 55) to increase the speed limit of the Maryland section of the Beltway from 55 to 70&nbsp;mph, in a bid to reduce traffic congestion on the Beltway.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://wtop.com/dc-transit/2018/01/hit-the-gas-md-lawmaker-wants-to-up-speed-limits-on-i-495-i-270/ |title = Hit the gas: Md. lawmaker wants to up speed limits on Capital Beltway, I-270 |date = January 19, 2018 |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WTOP-FM]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en-US }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Maryland-Proposal-Boost-Beltway-I-270-Speed-Limits-70-Mph-470205523.html |title = Proposal Would Boost Beltway, I-270 Speed Limits to 70 Mph |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WRC-TV]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en }}</ref>\n\n===Current roadworks===\n[[File:Woodrow wilson bridge june06.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] under reconstruction, June 2006]]\nThe [[Springfield Interchange]] in Virginia completed reconstruction in 2007.

The new Wilson Bridge is higher and wider than the original 1961 span, which was demolished in 2006. The Outer Loop span opened in June 2006, and the Inner Loop span opened in May 2008.\n\nAlso, in association with the Wilson Bridge project, the [[Virginia State Route 241|Telegraph Road]] and [[U.S. 1]] interchanges (exits 176 and 177) in Alexandria, Virginia were rebuilt. The [[Interstate 295 (Maryland)|I-295]] and [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]]  interchanges (exits 2 and 3) in Maryland were rebuilt as well. These improvement lasted through 2013.\n\nThe Branch Avenue ([[Maryland Route 5]]) Interchange was also improved.\n\n===Virginia HOT lanes===\n{{main|Virginia HOT lanes}}\n[[File:VA 07 2012 I495 HOT facility 3664.JPG|thumb|300px|495 Express Lanes ([[High occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|HOT lanes]]) under construction at the I-495 interchange with [[Virginia State Route 123|Route 123]] in [[Tysons Corner]].

Originally, all exits on the Beltway were numbered sequentially in a clockwise direction, starting with exit 1 for US 1 in Alexandria. After the eastern half of the Beltway was renumbered in 1977 as [[Interstate 95]], exits on the Maryland portion were renumbered to the current format, counterclockwise with exit numbers assigned to mileposts.  This caused problems because there were some exits that had the same number in Maryland and Virginia.  Around 2000, this problem was solved by renumbering all of the Virginia exits. The exit numbers between the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Springfield Interchange]]\u2014Interstate 495's intersection with [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] and [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95 in Virginia]]\u2014became a continuation of the Maryland exit numbers from the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] to the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]]. The exit numbers between the [[Springfield Interchange]] and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge became a continuation of the exit numbers of I-95 in Virginia; such exit numbers are much higher than those on the rest of the Beltway, but continue to increase in the counterclockwise direction. The counterclockwise numbering on the Capital Beltway is a rarity, as most similar loop highways, like the [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|Baltimore Beltway]], have their exit numbers/mileage set in a clockwise arrangement.\n\n==Exit list==\n===Mainline===\nThe Commonwealth of Virginia formerly reset exit numbers at state lines, and numbered them from the counterclockwise end to the clockwise end.{{jcttop|old|state_col=State|old_ref=<ref>{{cite map |author = [[H.M.

I-495 is widely known as the '''Capital Beltway''', or simply '''the Beltway''', especially when the context of Washington, D.C., is clear. It is the basis of the phrase \"[[inside the Beltway]]\", used when referring to issues dealing with American [[government]] and [[politics]]. [[Interstate 95|I-95]] utilizes the southern and eastern half of the Capital Beltway to circumnavigate Washington, D.C., and is [[concurrency (road)|cosigned]] with I-495 along that portion.\n\nThis [[loop road|circumferential roadway]] is located not only in the states of Virginia and Maryland, but also crosses briefly through the District of Columbia, near the western end of the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]].  The Beltway passes through [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] and [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] in Maryland, and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in Virginia.\n\nThe [[Cabin John Parkway]], a short connector between I-495 and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] near the Potomac River along the Maryland\u2013Virginia border, is considered an Interstate [[highway spur|spur]] (I-495X) by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]].\n\n==Route description==\nExcept for the westernmost part of Woodrow Wilson Bridge south of downtown Washington (the water below is considered part of the District of Columbia), the Capital Beltway encircles [[Washington, D.C.]], in adjacent [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. The two directions of travel, [[clockwise]] and [[counterclockwise]] (looking at a map), have become known respectively as the \"'''Inner Loop'''\" and the \"'''Outer Loop'''\". The route descriptions below follow the direction of the Outer Loop, starting at the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, south of Washington.\n\n[[File:2018-10-31 14 23 17 Signs for Interstate 495 and the Capital Beltway along eastbound U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard) just west of Virginia State Route 650 (Gallows Road) in Woodburn, Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|120px|left|I-495/Capital Beltway signage in Virginia]]\nMost Beltway interchanges provide access to Washington, with [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]] and [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|I-295]] from the south, [[Interstate 66|I-66]] from the west, and [[U.S. Route 50|US 50]] from both the west and the east among the most frequently used. More scenic routes from the Beltway into the District are offered by the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] along the Virginia side of the Potomac, the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Maryland side of the river, and the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]], approaching Washington from the northeast.\n\nOriginally, the entire Beltway was simply I-495, and [[Interstate 95|I-95]] was planned to serve downtown Washington, D.C., from the south and north, intersecting the Beltway in Virginia and in Maryland.  However, environmental litigation stopped completion of this plan, and the built portion of I-95 inside the Beltway from the south northward into downtown Washington was redesignated [[Interstate 395 (Virginia\u2013District of Columbia)|I-395]] in 1977.  The small built portion from the north was converted into a park-and-ride lot. I-95 was then rerouted (and so signed) along the eastern side of the Beltway, with the I-495 designation left only along the western side.  In 1989, the I-495 designation was returned to the eastern portion as well, with the highway co-signed as I-95 and I-495 along this route.\n\n===District of Columbia===\n[[File:2007 04 25 - WWB 44.JPG|left|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] carrying I-95/I-495 over the [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]] and [[Oxon Hill, Maryland]] (2007)]]\nThe Beltway (here I-95 and I-495 together), four lanes in each direction, travels over the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[estuary|tidal]] [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].

After crossing the Potomac, I-95/I-495 narrows to eight lanes with two local and two express lanes in each direction, and immediately meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|Interstate 295]], known as the Anacostia Freeway, a route that serves downtown [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to the north, connecting in Washington to [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Interstate 695]]. This large interchange also connects to National Harbor Boulevard which links the National Harbor with the Beltway and I-295. The highway passes south of [[Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm]] and next intersects [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]] (Indian Head Highway) , a major north\u2013south route from southern D.C. to [[Indian Head, Maryland|Indian Head]] in [[Charles County, Maryland]], which also serves the town of Forest Heights to the north at another interconnected interchange.\n\nHeading eastward, the Beltway's (I-95/I-495) local\u2013express lane configuration ends before it interchanges with various local highways, including [[Maryland Route 5|MD 5]] and [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]] on either side of [[Andrews Air Force Base]], which the Beltway travels near its northern edge. (Both MD 5 and MD 4 extend westward into D.C., and southeastward into [[Southern Maryland]].) Past the MD 4 interchange, the Beltway turns north through [[Glenarden, Maryland|Glenarden]], interchanging with [[Maryland Route 202|MD 202]].\n\nThe Beltway then interchanges with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]]/unsigned [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|I-595]], a major highway from downtown Washington eastward to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, and the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] to Maryland's [[Eastern Shore, Maryland|Eastern Shore]]. Both US 50 and MD 450 (which interchanges with the Beltway slightly northward) provide access to the New Carrollton [[New Carrollton (Washington Metro)|Metro]], [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail, and [[Amtrak]] stations, and the [[New Carrollton, Maryland|New Carrollton]] area.\n[[File:Washington Beltway I-495.jpg|thumb|left|I-495/I-95 Northbound in Maryland, at the Rhode Island Ave. overpass]]\n\nTurning northwest, the Beltway then enters [[Greenbelt Park]], intersecting the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]] (B-W Parkway) in the northeastern edge of the park. Just after the B-W Parkway, I-95/I-495 passes an interchange with [[Maryland Route 201|MD 201]], which connects to the southern terminus of the B-W Parkway at US&nbsp;50 near the D.C. line. Now turned fully west, the Beltway runs through the northern edge of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]], interchanging with the access roadway for the [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]] [[Greenbelt (Washington Metro)|Metro]] and [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail stations, then [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]].\n\nBeyond the US 1 interchange, I-95 separates from I-495 at the College Park Interchange. I-495 continues west, alone, on the Capital Beltway, while I-95 turns northeast towards [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[New York, New York|New York City]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The interchange includes access to a [[Park and Ride]] lot which was originally paved as part of I-95's route within the Beltway.\n\nContinuing west from the College Park Interchange, I-495 crosses into [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], entering a heavily developed and populated area. Passing underneath [[Maryland Route 212|MD 212]] with no access, the route interchanges with [[Maryland Route 650|MD 650]] near the [[George Washington Cemetery]]. After bisecting [[Northwest Branch Park]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 193|MD 193]] and [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US 29]] south of [[Four Corners, Maryland|Four Corners]]; the two interchanges are little more than 1/2 mile apart. Southbound US 29 is the main route into downtown [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], continuing into Washington.\n\nSqueezing past [[Argyle Park]] and [[Sligo Creek Golf Course]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 97|MD 97]] northwest of Silver Spring, then follows an alignment formerly known as '''Rock Creek Parkway'''.<ref group=lower-alpha>Not the extant parkway in Rock Creek Park within D.C.</ref> The route twists along the alignment, through and around [[Rock Creek Park]], then interchanges with [[Maryland Route 185|MD 185]] near the [[National Naval Medical Center]]. Turning northwest, I-495 soon encounters the southern terminus of [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]], which extends northwestward to meet [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in [[Frederick, Maryland]].\n\n[[File:I495 MD 10 2005 165.JPG|left|thumb|I-270/I-495 split (October 2005)]]\nI-270 and I-495 split at a highly complex Y-junction, with two separate HOV connections to I-270's HOV lanes and separate ramps to and from [[Maryland Route 355|MD 355]] (formerly [[U.S. Route 240|US 240]]). The old Rock Creek Parkway alignment follows I-270 north, while I-495 turns west and enters the only other six-lane segment of the Beltway still in existence; significant levels of traffic exit onto I-270 north, leaving the six-lane segment west of the split adequate.\n[[File:2016-01-22 09 58 00 View west along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at a signed 50 mph left curve west of Exit 36 in North Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp curve on the outer loop of the Beltway at the interchange with I-270 Spur in North Bethesda]]\nInterchanging with Old Georgetown Road ([[Maryland Route 187|MD 187]]), I-495 soon meets the [[Interstate 270 Spur]], the other side of the I-270/I-495 triangle. I-495 joins I-270 Spur at a converging [[Interchange (road)#Full Y interchange|wye]] junction; Inner Loop traffic exits from itself at the southern terminus of I-270 Spur, while Outer Loop traffic crosses the spur and enters it from the right. The two carriageways of I-495 temporarily widen to five lanes each until the [[Maryland Route 190|MD 190]] and [[Cabin John Parkway]] interchanges.  (MD 190 provides access to the northwestern portion of Washington, D.C., and to the [[Potomac, Maryland|Potomac]] and [[Great Falls, Maryland]] areas of Maryland's [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], while the Cabin John Parkway extends to the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Potomac River.)\n\nAfter these interchanges, the Beltway then narrows to eight lanes again. Turning sharply to the west, I-495 meets the Clara Barton Parkway along the north side of the [[Potomac River]];  this parkway provides a scenic route eastward into the western part of Washington, and westward toward the Potomac River's [[Great Falls (Potomac River)|Great Falls]].  After this interchange, the Beltway soon crosses the [[Mather Gorge|Potomac Gorge]] into [[Virginia]] over the ten-lane [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]].\n[[File:2015-12-08 14 07 24 View northeast towards the American Legion Memorial Bridge (Interstate 495) connecting Montgomery County, Maryland and Fairfax County, Virginia from the south bank of the Potomac River.jpg|left|thumb|American Legion Memorial Bridge carrying the western section of the Beltway over the Potomac River (2015)]]\n\n===Virginia===\n{{See also|Virginia HOT lanes#495 Express Lanes}}\n\nImmediately after crossing into [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia, I-495 encounters the western terminus of the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] at a [[trumpet interchange]];  the Parkway provides a scenic route to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia, and downtown Washington.  The Beltway then continues south, next interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 193|VA 193]] south of [[Dranesville District Park]], then reaches the extensive triangle of interchanges between I-495, the [[Dulles Airport Access Road]], [[Virginia State Route 267|VA 267]], and [[Virginia State Route 123|VA 123]]. The eastbound Dulles Access Road here also provides access to I-66 for Outer Loop Beltway traffic.  The former interchange with the toll road (VA 267) is a directional interchange, while the latter is a cloverleaf; the entire complex occurs east of the [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]] business district.\n\nNow running south, the Beltway interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 7|VA 7]] (Leesburg Pike) east of Tysons Corner; passing [[Dunn Loring, Virginia|Dunn Loring]] to the east, I-495 soon reaches the complex interchange with [[Interstate 66]], which extends westward to [[I-81]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] near [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]], Virginia, and eastward to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and downtown Washington. In a similar design as the I-270/I-495 interchange, dedicated HOV connections exist between I-495 and I-66, with many reversible and other directional ramps providing the remaining connections. There is no access between the Outer Loop and eastbound I-66 at this interchange. Instead, Outer Loop traffic must use the eastbound [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] exit 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) to the north in order to reach I-66 East.<ref group=lower-alpha>If a driver gets onto westbound I-66 at the Leesburg Pike (SR&nbsp;7) entrance, the only choice for getting to northbound I-495 is to take I-66 west to the Nutley Street exit and then get on I-66 east. A similar situation occurs for going from the [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] at Chain Bridge Road ([[Virginia State Route 123|SR&nbsp;123]]) to southbound I-495, where it is assumed that the driver will know to continue along SR&nbsp;7 or SR&nbsp;123 directly to the Beltway.</ref> There are multiple ramps from I-66 east to the Inner Loop, with one ramp exiting from the left side of I-66 east and the other exiting from the right. The [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] leads to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], which then changes over to the [[Dulles Greenway]] and ends at [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]].\n\nSouth of the I-66 interchange, the Beltway crosses under [[U.S. Route 29 in Virginia|US 29]] and [[Virginia State Route 237|VA 237]] with no access, then encounters a large braided interchange between I-495, [[U.S. Route 50 in Virginia|US 50]], and two local roads; the direct interchange between I-495 and US 50 is a full cloverleaf, while the braided local interchanges between I-495, US 50, and the local roads are modified [[SPUI]]s. The entire complex is bounded on the northeast side by Fairview Lake and on the southwest side by an office complex.\n\nContinuing due south, the route then interchanges with Gallows Road, then skirts the eastern edge of [[Mill Creek Park (Virginia)|Mill Creek Park]] before interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 236|VA 236]] southwest of [[Annandale Community Park]]. Running along the eastern edge of [[Wakefield Park (Annandale, Virginia)|Wakefield Park]], the Beltway turns southeast and interchanges with [[State Route 620 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 620]] before turning east near [[Flag Run Park]] and entering [[Springfield, Virginia|Springfield]], meeting the [[Springfield Interchange]] with I-95 southeast of the [[Shirley Industrial Complex]].\n\nI-95 joins the Beltway within the [[Springfield Interchange]]. I-495 also meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 395 (Virginia)|Interstate 395]] within the same massive interchange complex.\n[[File:Capital Beltway from Metro bridge.jpg|thumb|left|I-95/I-495 in Alexandria, seen from the [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Line]] of the [[Washington Metro]]]]\nRunning due east away from the interchange, crossing to the south of [[Backlick Stream Valley Park]], the Beltway (now I-95/I495) interchanges with [[State Route 613 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 613]] a mile east of the Springfield Interchange. Continuing east, the Beltway encounters a diamond interchange with a connector road linking to Eisenhower Avenue, which parallels the Beltway for a short distance. Skirting the northern edges of [[Loftridge Park]] and [[Burgundy Park]] the two routes enter [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and soon reach [[Virginia State Route 241|VA 241]], a direct route into the city, currently under major reconstruction.

The first section of the {{convert|64|mi|km|adj=on}} long Beltway (including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge|Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]]) was opened on December 21, 1961; the highway was completed on August 17, 1964.\n\nOriginally designated I-495, in 1977 the eastern portion of the Beltway was re-designated [[Interstate 95|I-95]] when a proposed alignment of I-95 from [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., through [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] to I-495 was canceled. Motorists never fully adjusted to the two halves of the Beltway having different numbers. According to Ron Shaffer of the ''Washington Post'',\n\n{{quote|There were signs stating that to continue on the Beltway, you had to get off at the next exit, when all you really had to do was keep going straight.

This parlance too has led to its own confusion, with unfamiliar motorists imagining two separate, distinct highway alignments, one some distance inside the other. At entrance ramps to the Beltway and on the on-highway signage, \"Inner Loop\" and \"Outer Loop\" shields are posted in conjunction with the route marker shields, although the terms are not emphasized in signage.\n\nThe Beltway was originally envisioned as primarily a bypass for long-distance eastern seaboard traffic to avoid driving directly through Washington. However, the explosive growth both of housing and business in the Washington suburbs following the Beltway's completion quickly made the Beltway the area's \"main street\" for local traffic as well. Numerous large shopping malls, community colleges, sports and concert stadiums, and corporate employment centers were purposely built adjacent to the Beltway, and these added greatly to the traffic, as has the passenger growth of regional airports accessed by the Beltway. The formerly more affordable price of housing in Southern Maryland versus [[Northern Virginia]], also led tens of thousands of commuters to live in Southern Maryland and commute on the Beltway to Virginia. The newer [[Fairfax County Parkway]] in the 1990s helped ease some traffic on the Virginia beltway; however, various proposals to build another complete [[Washington Outer Beltway|outer beltway]] in the outer suburbs has not gotten off the ground, because local governments in Maryland object to building additional [[Potomac River]] crossings as well as destroying protected \"open space\" and creating [[suburban sprawl|sprawl]].\n\n===College Park Interchange===\n[[File:College Park Interchange.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the College Park Interchange]]\n[[File:2019-06-03 11 53 32 View north along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway at the split between Interstate 95 North towards Baltimore and Interstate 495 West towards Silver Spring in Beltsville, Prince Georges County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The I-95/I-495 split at College Park, Maryland]]\nThe College Park Interchange is the informal name for the northern interchange between I-95 and I-495 in College Park. The interchange was partially opened, along with the connecting segment of I-95, in 1971, completing I-95 between the Baltimore Beltway and the Capital Beltway. As originally planned, it was designed with the idea that mainline I-95 through traffic would continue straight through the interchange and south into [[Washington D.C.]] as the [[Northeast Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|Northeast Freeway]], joining the [[North Central Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|North Central Freeway]] within D.C. and running south towards the central business district. When the D.C. government canceled its segment of I-95 in 1977, I-95 was rerouted onto the eastern half of the Capital Beltway, which lost its designation as I-495 (this was restored in 1989, forming a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] of I-95 and I-495 on the eastern half). As a result of this rerouting, the interchange was placed under considerable pressure to cater for a traffic flow that it was not designed to handle.\n\nOriginally, travelers from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop had to traverse the one-lane cloverleaf ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange; after exiting the ramp, traffic then had to weave through Inner Loop traffic headed for [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]]. This unsafe condition was rectified by November 1986, when the flyover from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop was constructed for I-95 southbound through traffic; the existing one-lane cloverleaf ramp was retained for access to the new C-D lane on the Inner Loop within the US 1 interchange, to segregate through traffic from southbound I-95 and local traffic for US 1. The stump end of the interchange was also modified into its present configuration, and the [[Park and Ride]] was built.\n\n===Traffic congestion===\nDespite numerous widening projects during its history, heavy traffic on the Beltway is a continuing problem. The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]]\u2014where eight lanes were squeezed into six\u2014was particularly onerous, with miles-long backups daily during commuter rush hours and on heavily traveled weekends. Relief for this bottleneck came on May 30, 2008, when the 12-lane replacement bridge opened to traffic in both directions (the six-lane span carrying Outer Loop traffic had opened in June 2006). Two of the lanes on the Wilson are being held in reserve  for future use as bus rapid transit or rail transit.\n\n[[File:2019-05-29 17 54 50 View south along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at Exit 57A (Interstate 95 South, Richmond) along the edge of North Springfield and Springfield in Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|left|View south along I-495 approaching the Springfield Interchange in Springfield, Virginia]]\nTwo intersections on the Capital Beltway are ranked in the top 20 on a study of the \"worst bottlenecks in the nation.\" They are the I-495 at [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]] interchange in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], ranked third overall, which receives 760,425 cars daily, and the College Park Interchange in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], ranked 11th, with 340,125 cars. The [[Springfield Interchange]], where [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|I-395]], I-95, and I-495 meet, was previously ranked fifth worst in the nation, but recent improvements have taken it off the top 20. Local commuters refer to the Springfield Interchange as \"The Mixing Bowl,\" although this designation is reserved by highway officials for the even more complicated [[Pentagon road network|interchange]] complex adjacent to [[The Pentagon]] on the original [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] (currently better-known as [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]]) at [[Virginia State Route 27|State Route 27]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]].\n\nIn April 2005, the [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] signed an agreement with two private companies to build [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes on the stretch of the Beltway between Springfield and Georgetown Pike.  Construction began in 2008. Maryland officials are considering such lanes on their segment of the Beltway, as well as other major commuter highways in the state. Locals who disapprove of these projects have nicknamed them \"[[Lexus]] Lanes\" because of the potential high price for using the lanes in exchange for bypassing congestion. These new lanes are one stage of a controversial project to widen the beltway, with the second stage involving widening the beltway to 12 lanes; opponents have called for various alternatives to this project (as well as the controversial [[Maryland Route 200|Intercounty Connector]] project) which would divert many vehicles off the northern beltway. The [[Maryland Transit Administration]]'s proposed [[Purple Line (Maryland)|Purple Line]] light rail transit line is just one example.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |title = The Beltway |publisher = Coalition for Smarter Growth |accessdate = August 24, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091220004753/http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |archive-date = December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Beltway has been improved since it opened. The American Legion Bridge was expanded by two lanes. HOV lanes were added between River Road and the I-270 Spur in Montgomery County, Maryland. The interchange between I-95 and the Beltway in Prince George's County, Maryland was originally designed to be a cloverleaf to allow I-95 to extend southward toward the District of Columbia. After I-95 was realigned onto the Beltway, a flyover ramp was built to allow I-95 through traffic to have two high-speed lanes. The interchange between U.S. Route 50 and I-95/I-495 in Prince George's County, Maryland was upgraded from a simple cloverleaf to a hybrid turbine interchange. In the Beltway's original configuration, I-295 and Indian Head Highway had separate interchanges. As a result, north-south traffic between I-295 and Indian Head Highway was forced to merge onto a congested section of the Beltway for approximately one mile. As a congestion relief measure, I-295 was extended over the Beltway and continued parallel to it so that the two highways were directly connected independent of the beltway. However, these interchanges were redesigned and rebuilt to accommodate the expansion of the Wilson Bridge and the construction of dedicated ramps to National Harbor.\n\nIn January 2018, Maryland State Democratic Sen. [[Joanne C. Benson|Joanne Benson]] of Prince George's County proposed legislation (Senate Bill 55) to increase the speed limit of the Maryland section of the Beltway from 55 to 70&nbsp;mph, in a bid to reduce traffic congestion on the Beltway.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://wtop.com/dc-transit/2018/01/hit-the-gas-md-lawmaker-wants-to-up-speed-limits-on-i-495-i-270/ |title = Hit the gas: Md. lawmaker wants to up speed limits on Capital Beltway, I-270 |date = January 19, 2018 |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WTOP-FM]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en-US }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Maryland-Proposal-Boost-Beltway-I-270-Speed-Limits-70-Mph-470205523.html |title = Proposal Would Boost Beltway, I-270 Speed Limits to 70 Mph |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WRC-TV]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en }}</ref>\n\n===Current roadworks===\n[[File:Woodrow wilson bridge june06.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] under reconstruction, June 2006]]\nThe [[Springfield Interchange]] in Virginia completed reconstruction in 2007.  The eight-year, nearly $676 million project worked to eliminate weaving among local and long-distance traffic between I-95, I-395, the Beltway, and [[Virginia State Route 644 (Fairfax County)|State Route 644]].\n\nThe [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] underwent reconstruction in a major project that began in 1999; it now provides express and local lanes for both the Inner and Outer Loops. The new Wilson Bridge is higher and wider than the original 1961 span, which was demolished in 2006. The Outer Loop span opened in June 2006, and the Inner Loop span opened in May 2008.\n\nAlso, in association with the Wilson Bridge project, the [[Virginia State Route 241|Telegraph Road]] and [[U.S. 1]] interchanges (exits 176 and 177) in Alexandria, Virginia were rebuilt. The [[Interstate 295 (Maryland)|I-295]] and [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]]  interchanges (exits 2 and 3) in Maryland were rebuilt as well. These improvement lasted through 2013.\n\nThe Branch Avenue ([[Maryland Route 5]]) Interchange was also improved.\n\n===Virginia HOT lanes===\n{{main|Virginia HOT lanes}}\n[[File:VA 07 2012 I495 HOT facility 3664.JPG|thumb|300px|495 Express Lanes ([[High occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|HOT lanes]]) under construction at the I-495 interchange with [[Virginia State Route 123|Route 123]] in [[Tysons Corner]].

Originally, all exits on the Beltway were numbered sequentially in a clockwise direction, starting with exit 1 for US 1 in Alexandria. After the eastern half of the Beltway was renumbered in 1977 as [[Interstate 95]], exits on the Maryland portion were renumbered to the current format, counterclockwise with exit numbers assigned to mileposts.  This caused problems because there were some exits that had the same number in Maryland and Virginia.  Around 2000, this problem was solved by renumbering all of the Virginia exits. The exit numbers between the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Springfield Interchange]]\u2014Interstate 495's intersection with [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] and [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95 in Virginia]]\u2014became a continuation of the Maryland exit numbers from the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] to the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]]. The exit numbers between the [[Springfield Interchange]] and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge became a continuation of the exit numbers of I-95 in Virginia; such exit numbers are much higher than those on the rest of the Beltway, but continue to increase in the counterclockwise direction.
