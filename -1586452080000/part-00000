It was released in November 1975 as the lead single of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' (1976). It was the first track completed during the album's sessions, a period when Bowie's [[cocaine]] addiction was at its peak. At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"Golden Years\" was the first track recorded for ''Station to Station'' in September 1975 at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Regarding the recording, co-producer [[Harry Maslin]] recalled that the song was \"cut and finished very fast. We knew it was absolutely right within ten days. But the rest of the album took forever.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} Sources differ as to who the track was written for. According to authors [[Nicholas Pegg]], David Buckley and Christopher Sandford, the track was supposedly written for [[Elvis Presley]] to cover, who turned it down.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}}{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}} Bowie recalled that Presley had heard the demos and because both artists were signed to [[RCA Records]] at the time, Presley's manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]] thought that Bowie should write songs for Presley. Bowie stated that he had \"adored\" Presley and would have loved to work with him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Although the artists' office contacted each other, nothing ever came to fruition.

The original film score was written for the film by Hollywood composer [[Carter Burwell]]. One scene in the movie is a formal dance, which calls for courtly music based on Burwell's love theme to segue into David Bowie's song \"Golden Years\". It presented several challenges. First, the whole dance had been choreographed and filmed to an arbitrary tempo which begins at a slow courtly pace and speeds up and up until Bowie's song kicks in. Burwell had to match that tempo and the choreography after the fact and also find some credible path from a formal and restrained dance to a joyful '70s pop tune. They obtained Bowie's permission to pull tracks from his multitrack master of the song so they could mix these into Burwell's arrangement, helping to introduce his song before it has really begun. The end result is not on either of the CDs which were released (song or score soundtrack). Tony Visconti, who produced the original recording of the song, supervised the remix session, and Bowie dropped by as well to hear what they found in his multitrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |title=A Knight's Tale |publisher=Carter Burwell |date= |accessdate=2016-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906192026/http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |archive-date=6 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1975\u201376)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|34\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|9|song=Golden Years|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}\n|-\n|Netherlands \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |title=Flavour of New Zealand, 9 April 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923200644/http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |archive-date=23 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|Sweden \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Charts Company |url=http://Officialcharts.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217061412/http://www.officialcharts.com/ |archive-date=17 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' \u2013 {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 Singles, March 27, 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020004019/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |archive-date=20 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |title= Top Singles \u2013 Volume 26, No. 14 & 15, January 08 1977 |work= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |publisher= [[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate= January 22, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160610094136/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |archive-date= 10 June 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|144\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |title=Musicoutfitters.com |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116082743/https://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |archive-date=16 November 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==David Bowie vs KCRW==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Golden Years David Bowie vs KCRW\n| cover      = DavidBowie-GoldenYearsKCRW.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[David Bowie]]\n| album      =\n| released   = 2011\n| format     = [[CD single]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     = \n| venue      =\n| genre      = \n| length     =\n| label      = [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]\n| writer     = \n| producer   = \n| prev_title = [[Rebel Never Gets Old]]\n| prev_year  = 2004\n| next_title = [[Where Are We Now?]]\n| next_year  = 2013\n}}\n\nAn updated single of \"Golden Years\" was released in 2011 to coincide with the re-release of ''Station to Station''.

The original film score was written for the film by Hollywood composer [[Carter Burwell]]. One scene in the movie is a formal dance, which calls for courtly music based on Burwell's love theme to segue into David Bowie's song \"Golden Years\". It presented several challenges. First, the whole dance had been choreographed and filmed to an arbitrary tempo which begins at a slow courtly pace and speeds up and up until Bowie's song kicks in. Burwell had to match that tempo and the choreography after the fact and also find some credible path from a formal and restrained dance to a joyful '70s pop tune. They obtained Bowie's permission to pull tracks from his multitrack master of the song so they could mix these into Burwell's arrangement, helping to introduce his song before it has really begun. The end result is not on either of the CDs which were released (song or score soundtrack). Tony Visconti, who produced the original recording of the song, supervised the remix session, and Bowie dropped by as well to hear what they found in his multitrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |title=A Knight's Tale |publisher=Carter Burwell |date= |accessdate=2016-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906192026/http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |archive-date=6 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1975\u201376)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|34\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|9|song=Golden Years|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}\n|-\n|Netherlands \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |title=Flavour of New Zealand, 9 April 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923200644/http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |archive-date=23 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|Sweden \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Charts Company |url=http://Officialcharts.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217061412/http://www.officialcharts.com/ |archive-date=17 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' \u2013 {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 Singles, March 27, 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020004019/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |archive-date=20 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |title= Top Singles \u2013 Volume 26, No. 14 & 15, January 08 1977 |work= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |publisher= [[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate= January 22, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160610094136/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |archive-date= 10 June 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|144\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |title=Musicoutfitters.com |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116082743/https://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |archive-date=16 November 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==David Bowie vs KCRW==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Golden Years David Bowie vs KCRW\n| cover      = DavidBowie-GoldenYearsKCRW.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[David Bowie]]\n| album      =\n| released   = 2011\n| format     = [[CD single]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     = \n| venue      =\n| genre      = \n| length     =\n| label      = [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]\n| writer     = \n| producer   = \n| prev_title = [[Rebel Never Gets Old]]\n| prev_year  = 2004\n| next_title = [[Where Are We Now?]]\n| next_year  = 2013\n}}\n\nAn updated single of \"Golden Years\" was released in 2011 to coincide with the re-release of ''Station to Station''.

It was released on his 1975 album ''[[Young Americans]]'' and was later issued as the album's second [[Single (music)|single]] by [[RCA Records]] in July 1975. Written by Bowie, [[Carlos Alomar]] and [[John Lennon]], \nthe song was a major commercial success in North America, becoming Bowie's first number 1 single on both the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the [[Canadian Singles Chart]]. The song was one of the more successful singles of the year, ranking at number 7 on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1975|''Billboard'' Year-End Hot 100]]. However, it was less successful in Europe, reaching number 17 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 1990, Bowie remixed the song under the title \"Fame '90\" to coincide with his [[Sound+Vision Tour]]. \"Fame\" has since appeared on many [[compilation album]]s, and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\nThe song is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/exhibits/500-songs-that-shaped-rock-and/ |title=The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll| website=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=12 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317150057/http://rockhall.com/exhibits/500-songs-that-shaped-rock-and/ |archive-date=17 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nWith the release of his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', Bowie achieved stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=616}} On that album, Bowie presented his aspirations to become famous in \"Star\", which also encapsulated the fantasies of \"every adolescent dreamer miming into a hairbrush in a suburban bedroom\", on top of Bowie's own frustration with not having fulfilled his potential.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=778}} By the beginning of 1975, \"fame\" meant a couple of different things to Bowie. It meant not only his stardom, but also impending lawsuits that were the result of the ending of Bowie's relationship with his manager [[Tony Defries]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} It also meant an expensive musical theatre project concocted by Defries, titled ''Fame'', that was financed through MainMan, a company that was built around Bowie's fame; the show was an examination of [[Marilyn Monroe]] that closed after one night on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and after already flopping off-Broadway.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} The failure of ''Fame'' almost ruined MainMan and was traumatic on Bowie and Defries' relationship.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} \n\nBowie would later describe \"Fame\" as \"nasty, angry\", and fully admitted that it was written \"with a degree of malice\" aimed at the MainMan. This is supported by biographer [[Peter Doggett]], who writes: \"every time in \"Fame\" that Bowie snapped back with a cynical retort about its pitfalls, he had [Defries] and [Defries's] epic folly in mind,\" and noted the lyric \"bully for you, chilly for me\" as the striking example.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} In 1990, Bowie recalled the song as his \"least favourite track on the album\"{{Sfn|Pegg|2016|p=257}} and reflected: \"I'd had very upsetting management problems and a lot of that was built into the song. I've left all that behind me, now... I think fame itself is not a rewarding thing. The most you can say is that it gets you a seat in restaurants.\"<ref name=Q90>{{Cite journal| title=David Bowie Interview| journal=[[Q magazine]] |date=April 1990 | pages=60\u201370}}</ref>\n\n==Composition and recording==\n[[File:John Lennon last television interview Tomorrow show 1975 (34 cropped).JPG|thumb|left|150px|alt=John Lennon in 1975|Bowie wrote \"Fame\" with former Beatle [[John Lennon]], who also contributes backing vocals and guitar.]]\nWith the ''[[Young Americans]]'' sessions mostly concluded by late 1974, the material was delayed while Bowie extricated himself from Defries. Sources differ on how \"Fame\" came to be in the studio, but both Doggett and [[Nicholas Pegg]] write that it was the product of \"happy\" accidents.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=275}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=256}} By late 1974, Bowie was staying in [[New York City]], where he met [[John Lennon]], who was in his [[John Lennon#1973\u20131975: \"Lost weekend\"|\"Lost weekend\"]] period of estrangement from his wife [[Yoko Ono]].{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=247}} The pair [[Jam session|jammed]] together, leading to a one-day session at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in January 1975. There, [[Carlos Alomar]] had developed a guitar riff for Bowie's cover of \"Footstompin'\" by [[the Flairs]], which Bowie thought was \"a waste\" to give to a [[cover version|cover]]. Lennon, who was in the studio with them, came up with the hook when he started to sing \"aim\" over the riff, which Bowie turned into \"Fame\" and thereafter, according to [[Marc Spitz]], wrote the rest of the lyrics to the song with Lennon.<ref name=TWRS>{{cite AV media | date=20 May 1990 | title=Timothy White's Rock Stars: Hearing Pictures: David Bowie's Sound + Vision|type=radio interview}}</ref>{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} However, according to Doggett, Lennon made the \"briefest lyrical contributions\" that was \"enough\" to give him co-writing credit.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=275}} Bowie would later say that Lennon was the \"energy\" and the \"inspiration\" for \"Fame\", and that's why he received a co-writing credit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=256}} Lennon would later contradict this story in a 1980 interview where he said: \"We took some [[Stevie Wonder]] middle eight and did it backwards, you know, and we made a record out of it!\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=275}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=256}} After the group solidified the riff, they emerged with something that was in the hand of \"black American music\" at the start of 1975: a \"cousin\" of \"[[Hollywood Swinging]]\" by [[Kool & the Gang]], \"[[The Payback (song)|The Payback]]\" by [[James Brown]], and \"[[Do It ('Til You're Satisfied)]]\" by [[B. T. Express]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=275\u2013276}} Doggett writes that other potential influences were the 1972 song \"Jungle Walk\" by [[the Rascals]] and the 1974 songs \"[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]\" by the [[Average White Band]] and \"Brighter Day\" by [[Keith Christmas]], a friend of Bowie's.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} Overall, Doggett believes \"Fame\" resembled \"[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]\" by [[Sly and the Family Stone]] which, like \"Fame\", is in the funk style with \"viciously pointed\" lyrics.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=277}}\n\n\"Fame\" is a [[funk rock]] song<ref name=\"funk rock\" /> that represents Bowie's (and Lennon's) dissatisfaction with the troubles of fame and stardom, including \"money-grabbing managers, mindless adulation, unwanted entourages and the hollow vacuity of the limousine lifestyle\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=256\u2013257}} Lennon's voice is heard interjecting the falsetto \"Fame\" throughout the song. Doggett found it \"striking\" that the falsetto expanded three octaves, from \"[[Yoko Ono]] soprano\" to \"[[Johnny Cash]] basso profundo\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=277}} Along with \"Fame\", Bowie worked with Lennon again when he decided to record a cover of Lennon's [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song \"[[Across the Universe]]\"; Lennon played rhythm guitar on the cover.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} According to Spitz, \"Fame\" and \"Across the Universe\" were both last-minute additions to ''Young Americans''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} Although ''Young Americans'' was mostly co-produced by [[Tony Visconti]], he was not present at the sessions for \"Fame\";{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} instead, both songs were co-produced by engineer [[Harry Maslin]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Visconti |first=Tony |title=Tony Visconti: the Autobiography: Bowie, Bolan and the Brooklyn Boy |year=2007 |publisher=Harper |pages=222\u2013224}}</ref> In the song, Bowie sings \"What you need, you have to borrow\" with, according to Spitz, the same \"venom\" that [[Jimi Hendrix]] sang, \"Businessmen they drink my wine,\" on his cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[All Along the Watchtower]]\".{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=247}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Fame\" was released on 7 March 1975 as the final track on Bowie's ninth studio album ''[[Young Americans]]''.<ref name=\"UK single liner notes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Young Americans|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1975|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|location=US|type=liner notes|id=APK1-0998}}</ref><ref name=\"Erlewine allmusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Young Americans'' \u2013 David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/young-americans-mw0000098919|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=3 February 2020}}</ref> It was subsequently released by RCA Records (as PB 10320) as the second single to the album on 25 July 1975 with fellow album track \"[[Right (David Bowie song)|Right]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"UK single liner notes\" /> \"Fame\" became Bowie's biggest hit to that point in the US. It was his first number one hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, as well as his first to break the top 10, but would only reach number 17 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

English singer-songwriter [[David Bowie]]. It was released on his 1975 album ''[[Young Americans]]'' and was later issued as the album's second [[Single (music)|single]] by [[RCA Records]] in July 1975. Written by Bowie, [[Carlos Alomar]] and [[John Lennon]], \nthe song was a major commercial success in North America, becoming Bowie's first number 1 single on both the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the [[Canadian Singles Chart]]. The song was one of the more successful singles of the year, ranking at number 7 on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1975|''Billboard'' Year-End Hot 100]]. However, it was less successful in Europe, reaching number 17 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 1990, Bowie remixed the song under the title \"Fame '90\" to coincide with his [[Sound+Vision Tour]]. \"Fame\" has since appeared on many [[compilation album]]s, and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\nThe song is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/exhibits/500-songs-that-shaped-rock-and/ |title=The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll| website=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=12 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317150057/http://rockhall.com/exhibits/500-songs-that-shaped-rock-and/ |archive-date=17 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nWith the release of his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', Bowie achieved stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=616}} On that album, Bowie presented his aspirations to become famous in \"Star\", which also encapsulated the fantasies of \"every adolescent dreamer miming into a hairbrush in a suburban bedroom\", on top of Bowie's own frustration with not having fulfilled his potential.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=778}} By the beginning of 1975, \"fame\" meant a couple of different things to Bowie. It meant not only his stardom, but also impending lawsuits that were the result of the ending of Bowie's relationship with his manager [[Tony Defries]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} It also meant an expensive musical theatre project concocted by Defries, titled ''Fame'', that was financed through MainMan, a company that was built around Bowie's fame; the show was an examination of [[Marilyn Monroe]] that closed after one night on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and after already flopping off-Broadway.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} The failure of ''Fame'' almost ruined MainMan and was traumatic on Bowie and Defries' relationship.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} \n\nBowie would later describe \"Fame\" as \"nasty, angry\", and fully admitted that it was written \"with a degree of malice\" aimed at the MainMan. This is supported by biographer [[Peter Doggett]], who writes: \"every time in \"Fame\" that Bowie snapped back with a cynical retort about its pitfalls, he had [Defries] and [Defries's] epic folly in mind,\" and noted the lyric \"bully for you, chilly for me\" as the striking example.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=276}} In 1990, Bowie recalled the song as his \"least favourite track on the album\"{{Sfn|Pegg|2016|p=257}} and reflected: \"I'd had very upsetting management problems and a lot of that was built into the song. I've left all that behind me, now... I think fame itself is not a rewarding thing. The most you can say is that it gets you a seat in restaurants.\"<ref name=Q90>{{Cite journal| title=David Bowie Interview| journal=[[Q magazine]] |date=April 1990 | pages=60\u201370}}</ref>\n\n==Composition and recording==\n[[File:John Lennon last television interview Tomorrow show 1975 (34 cropped).JPG|thumb|left|150px|alt=John Lennon in 1975|Bowie wrote \"Fame\" with former Beatle [[John Lennon]], who also contributes backing vocals and guitar.]]\nWith the ''[[Young Americans]]'' sessions mostly concluded by late 1974, the material was delayed while Bowie extricated himself from Defries. Sources differ on how \"Fame\" came to be in the studio, but both Doggett and [[Nicholas Pegg]] write that it was the product of \"happy\" accidents.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=275}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=256}} By late 1974, Bowie was staying in [[New York City]], where he met [[John Lennon]], who was in his [[John Lennon#1973\u20131975: \"Lost weekend\"|\"Lost weekend\"]] period of estrangement from his wife [[Yoko Ono]].{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=247}} The pair [[Jam session|jammed]] together, leading to a one-day session at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in January 1975. There, [[Carlos Alomar]] had developed a guitar riff for Bowie's cover of \"Footstompin'\" by [[the Flairs]], which Bowie thought was \"a waste\" to give to a [[cover version|cover]]. Lennon, who was in the studio with them, came up with the hook when he started to sing \"aim\" over the riff, which Bowie turned into \"Fame\" and thereafter, according to [[Marc Spitz]], wrote the rest of the lyrics to the song with Lennon.<ref name=TWRS>{{cite AV media | date=20 May 1990 | title=Timothy White's Rock Stars: Hearing Pictures: David Bowie's Sound + Vision|type=radio interview}}</ref>{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} However, according to Doggett, Lennon made the \"briefest lyrical contributions\" that was \"enough\" to give him co-writing credit.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=275}} Bowie would later say that Lennon was the \"energy\" and the \"inspiration\" for \"Fame\", and that's why he received a co-writing credit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=256}} Lennon would later contradict this story in a 1980 interview where he said: \"We took some [[Stevie Wonder]] middle eight and did it backwards, you know, and we made a record out of it!\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=275}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=256}} After the group solidified the riff, they emerged with something that was in the hand of \"black American music\" at the start of 1975: a \"cousin\" of \"[[Hollywood Swinging]]\" by [[Kool & the Gang]], \"[[The Payback (song)|The Payback]]\" by [[James Brown]], and \"[[Do It ('Til You're Satisfied)]]\" by [[B.

Doggett found it \"striking\" that the falsetto expanded three octaves, from \"[[Yoko Ono]] soprano\" to \"[[Johnny Cash]] basso profundo\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=277}} Along with \"Fame\", Bowie worked with Lennon again when he decided to record a cover of Lennon's [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song \"[[Across the Universe]]\"; Lennon played rhythm guitar on the cover.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} According to Spitz, \"Fame\" and \"Across the Universe\" were both last-minute additions to ''Young Americans''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} Although ''Young Americans'' was mostly co-produced by [[Tony Visconti]], he was not present at the sessions for \"Fame\";{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=249}} instead, both songs were co-produced by engineer [[Harry Maslin]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Visconti |first=Tony |title=Tony Visconti: the Autobiography: Bowie, Bolan and the Brooklyn Boy |year=2007 |publisher=Harper |pages=222\u2013224}}</ref> In the song, Bowie sings \"What you need, you have to borrow\" with, according to Spitz, the same \"venom\" that [[Jimi Hendrix]] sang, \"Businessmen they drink my wine,\" on his cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[All Along the Watchtower]]\".{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=247}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Fame\" was released on 7 March 1975 as the final track on Bowie's ninth studio album ''[[Young Americans]]''.<ref name=\"UK single liner notes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Young Americans|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1975|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|location=US|type=liner notes|id=APK1-0998}}</ref><ref name=\"Erlewine allmusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Young Americans'' \u2013 David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/young-americans-mw0000098919|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=3 February 2020}}</ref> It was subsequently released by RCA Records (as PB 10320) as the second single to the album on 25 July 1975 with fellow album track \"[[Right (David Bowie song)|Right]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"UK single liner notes\" /> \"Fame\" became Bowie's biggest hit to that point in the US.

In vitro studies have shown that nitazoxanide inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Nitazoxanide is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, nitazoxanide is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.\n\n<ref name=\"DrugBank Nitazoxanide\">{{cite web|title=Nitazoxanide|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00507|website=DrugBank|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{cite journal | pmid =  26258002 | doi=10.1007/s40475-015-0051-1 | pmc=4523694 | volume=2 | title=Drug Resistance in the Microaerophilic Parasite Giardia lamblia | year=2015 | journal=Curr Trop Med Rep | pages=128\u2013135  | last1 = Leitsch | first1 = D}} is a review that covers its antiprotazoal pharmacodynamics\n-->\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nFollowing oral administration, nitazoxanide is rapidly [[hydrolyzed]] to the pharmacologically active metabolite, [[tizoxanide]], which is 99% protein bound.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /><ref name=\"pmid17888524\">{{cite journal |author=Korba BE |title=Nitazoxanide, tizoxanide and other thiazolides are potent inhibitors of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus replication |journal=Antiviral Res. |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=56\u201363 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17888524 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2007.08.005 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Montero AB |author3=Farrar K |display-authors=3 |last4=Gaye |first4=Karen |last5=Mukerjee |first5=Sampa |last6=Ayers |first6=Marc S. |last7=Rossignol |first7=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois}}</ref> Tizoxanide is then [[glucuronide conjugation|glucuronide conjugated]] into the active metabolite, [[tizoxanide glucuronide]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />  Peak plasma concentrations of the metabolites tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are observed 1\u20134&nbsp;hours after oral administration of nitazoxanide, whereas nitazoxanide itself is not detected in [[blood plasma]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\nRoughly {{frac|2|3}} of an oral dose of nitazoxanide is excreted as its metabolites in feces, while the remainder of the dose excreted in urine.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide is excreted in the [[urine]], [[bile]] and [[feces]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide glucuronide is excreted in urine and bile.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\n== Chemistry ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2016}}\nNitazoxanide is the prototype member of the [[thiazolide]]s, which is a [[drug class]] of structurally-related broad-spectrum [[antiparasitic]] compounds.<ref name=\"Thiazolides\" /> Nitazoxanide is a light yellow crystalline powder. It is poorly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in water.\n\n== History ==\nNitazoxanide was originally discovered in the 1980s by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rossignol]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]]. Initial studies demonstrated activity versus [[tapeworms]]. ''In vitro'' studies demonstrated much broader activity. Dr. Rossignol co-founded Romark Laboratories, with the goal of bringing nitazoxanide to market as an anti-parasitic drug. Initial studies in the USA were conducted in collaboration with Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ([[Marietta, GA]]) and focused on development of the drug for treatment of [[cryptosporidiosis]] in [[AIDS]]. Controlled trials began shortly after the advent of effective anti-retroviral therapies. The trials were abandoned due to poor enrollment and the FDA rejected an application based on uncontrolled studies.\n\nSubsequently, Romark launched a series of controlled trials. A placebo-controlled study of nitazoxanide in cryptosporidiosis demonstrated significant clinical improvement in adults and children with mild illness. Among malnourished children in Zambia with chronic cryptosporidiosis, a three-day course of therapy led to clinical and parasitologic improvement and improved survival. In Zambia and in a study conducted in Mexico, nitazoxanide was not successful in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in advanced infection with human immunodeficiency virus at the doses used. However, it was effective in patients with higher CD4 counts. In treatment of giardiasis, nitazoxanide was superior to placebo and comparable to [[metronidazole]]. Nitazoxanide was successful in the treatment of metronidazole-resistant giardiasis. Studies have suggested efficacy in the treatment of [[cyclosporiasis]], [[isosporiasis]], and [[amebiasis]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am. J. Trop. Med.

In vitro studies have shown that nitazoxanide inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Nitazoxanide is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, nitazoxanide is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.\n\n<ref name=\"DrugBank Nitazoxanide\">{{cite web|title=Nitazoxanide|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00507|website=DrugBank|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{cite journal | pmid =  26258002 | doi=10.1007/s40475-015-0051-1 | pmc=4523694 | volume=2 | title=Drug Resistance in the Microaerophilic Parasite Giardia lamblia | year=2015 | journal=Curr Trop Med Rep | pages=128\u2013135  | last1 = Leitsch | first1 = D}} is a review that covers its antiprotazoal pharmacodynamics\n-->\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nFollowing oral administration, nitazoxanide is rapidly [[hydrolyzed]] to the pharmacologically active metabolite, [[tizoxanide]], which is 99% protein bound.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /><ref name=\"pmid17888524\">{{cite journal |author=Korba BE |title=Nitazoxanide, tizoxanide and other thiazolides are potent inhibitors of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus replication |journal=Antiviral Res. |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=56\u201363 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17888524 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2007.08.005 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Montero AB |author3=Farrar K |display-authors=3 |last4=Gaye |first4=Karen |last5=Mukerjee |first5=Sampa |last6=Ayers |first6=Marc S. |last7=Rossignol |first7=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois}}</ref> Tizoxanide is then [[glucuronide conjugation|glucuronide conjugated]] into the active metabolite, [[tizoxanide glucuronide]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />  Peak plasma concentrations of the metabolites tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are observed 1\u20134&nbsp;hours after oral administration of nitazoxanide, whereas nitazoxanide itself is not detected in [[blood plasma]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\nRoughly {{frac|2|3}} of an oral dose of nitazoxanide is excreted as its metabolites in feces, while the remainder of the dose excreted in urine.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide is excreted in the [[urine]], [[bile]] and [[feces]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide glucuronide is excreted in urine and bile.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\n== Chemistry ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2016}}\nNitazoxanide is the prototype member of the [[thiazolide]]s, which is a [[drug class]] of structurally-related broad-spectrum [[antiparasitic]] compounds.<ref name=\"Thiazolides\" /> Nitazoxanide is a light yellow crystalline powder. It is poorly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in water.\n\n== History ==\nNitazoxanide was originally discovered in the 1980s by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rossignol]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]]. Initial studies demonstrated activity versus [[tapeworms]]. ''In vitro'' studies demonstrated much broader activity. Dr. Rossignol co-founded Romark Laboratories, with the goal of bringing nitazoxanide to market as an anti-parasitic drug. Initial studies in the USA were conducted in collaboration with Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ([[Marietta, GA]]) and focused on development of the drug for treatment of [[cryptosporidiosis]] in [[AIDS]]. Controlled trials began shortly after the advent of effective anti-retroviral therapies. The trials were abandoned due to poor enrollment and the FDA rejected an application based on uncontrolled studies.\n\nSubsequently, Romark launched a series of controlled trials. A placebo-controlled study of nitazoxanide in cryptosporidiosis demonstrated significant clinical improvement in adults and children with mild illness. Among malnourished children in Zambia with chronic cryptosporidiosis, a three-day course of therapy led to clinical and parasitologic improvement and improved survival. In Zambia and in a study conducted in Mexico, nitazoxanide was not successful in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in advanced infection with human immunodeficiency virus at the doses used. However, it was effective in patients with higher CD4 counts. In treatment of giardiasis, nitazoxanide was superior to placebo and comparable to [[metronidazole]]. Nitazoxanide was successful in the treatment of metronidazole-resistant giardiasis. Studies have suggested efficacy in the treatment of [[cyclosporiasis]], [[isosporiasis]], and [[amebiasis]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am. J. Trop. Med.

[[One Chase Manhattan Plaza]]) in a post-apocalyptic [[Manhattan]]. The guitar sound is heavily influenced by [[The Rolling Stones]], and signalled Bowie moving away from [[glam rock]] and closer to a [[proto-punk]] [[The Stooges|Stooges]]-influenced sound.<ref>[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': p.63</ref>\n\nThe track was considered by many commentators to be an unconventional single, and it only reached number 21 in the [[United Kingdom]]. According to ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], \"As a potential hit single, the title track from ''Diamond Dogs'' was something of a non-event. Too long, too bleak in vision, too tough to dance to... you know the drill.\"<ref>[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': p.64</ref>\n\nAlthough it was not issued in the US as a single (despite the fact that copies were pressed in the US for shipment to the UK and were commonly imported into the US for sale in shops that sold imports), the song became a central part of Bowie\u2019s [[Diamond Dogs Tour|North American tour]] in 1974.\n\nThe [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] was a version of Bowie\u2019s 1971 single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", re-recorded during the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' sessions the same year.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll tracks written by [[David Bowie]].<ref name=\"single liner notes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Diamond Dogs\"''|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1974|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=Single liner notes|id=APBO 0293}}</ref>\n# \"Diamond Dogs\" \u2013 5:56\n# \"[[Holy Holy]]\" \u2013 2:20\n\nIn Australia, a 2'58\" edit of \"Diamond Dogs\" was used (RCA 102462) instead of the full-length album version.<ref name=\"http://www.illustrated-db-discography.nl/\">{{cite web|author=Ruud Altenburg |url=http://www.illustrated-db-discography.nl/ |title=David Bowie \u2013 Illustrated db Discography |website=Illustrated-db-discography.nl |date= |accessdate=2016-10-09}}</ref>\n\n==Production credits==\n* Producers:\n** [[David Bowie]] on \"Diamond Dogs\"\n** [[Ken Scott]] on \"Holy Holy\"\n* Musicians:\n** David Bowie: vocals, guitar, sax\n** [[Herbie Flowers]]: bass\n** [[Mike Garson]]: piano\n** [[Aynsley Dunbar]]: drums\n** [[Mick Ronson]]: guitar on \"Holy Holy\"\n** [[Trevor Bolder]]: bass on \"Holy Holy\"\n** [[Mick Woodmansey]]: drums on \"Holy Holy\"\n\n==Charts==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1974)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|21\n|-\n| Finland ([[Suomen virallinen lista]])<ref>{{cite book | first= Timo | last= Pennanen |year= 2006 | title=Sis\u00e4lt\u00e4\u00e4 hitin \u2013 levyt ja esitt\u00e4j\u00e4t Suomen musiikkilistoilla vuodesta 1972 | publisher=Kustannusosakeyhti\u00f6 Otava | location= Helsinki | language= Finnish }}</ref> \n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 7\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|French Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|26\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|27\n|}\n\n==Live versions==\n* A live version from the first leg of the 1974 tour was released on ''[[David Live]]''.
