New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

The models can incorporate mitigation measures, seasonality, randomness, and other factors that can vary during a real epidemic. Similar tests are used by the insurance industry to understand risks posed by infrequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe Trump administration simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China in 2019 and found that the U.S. government response was \"underfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated\". Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported. It led President Trump to issue an executive order to make flu vaccines more readily available and of higher quality, and he provided additional funds for the pandemic threats program in the Department of Health and Human Services ([[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]]).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Before Virus Outbreak, a Cascade of Warnings Went Unheeded|date=March 19, 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 20, 2020|last2=Lipton|first2=Eric|issn=0362-4331|last3=Sullivan|first3=Eileen|last4=Crowley|first4=Michael}}</ref> White House economists published a study in September 2019 that warned a pandemic could kill half a million Americans and devastate the economy.<ref>''[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/coronavirus-economy-trump.html White House Economists Warned in 2019 a Pandemic Could Devastate America]'' March 31, 2020 New York Times</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the WHO also ran a simulation exercise of a global pandemic response involving more than 40 countries, although the results appear to be unavailable.<ref>[https://www.who.int/ihr/eoc-exercise/en/ \"Simulation exercise puts global pandemic readiness to the test\"], World Health Organization, Dec. 3, 2018</ref>\n\n===Potential response strategies===\n\nThe NSC created a pandemic playbook (called \"Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents\") in 2016 which laid out strategies and recommendations that an administration should take, including moving swiftly to fully detect potential outbreaks, securing supplemental funding and considering invoking the [[Defense Production Act of 1950|Defense Production Act]], and making sure there are sufficient personal protective equipment available for healthcare workers.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

It was considered a model prison because it turned a profit for the state.<ref name=\"correctionhistory.org\"/> Lynds employed the [[Auburn system]], which imposed absolute silence on the prisoners; the system was enforced by whipping and other punishments. It was John Luckey, the Prison Chaplain around 1843, who held the Principal Keeper of Sing Sing, Elam Lynds, accountable to New York Governor William H. Seward and to President of the Board of Inspectors, John Edmonds, to have Lynds removed. Chaplain Luckey proceeded to create a great religious library. His purpose was to teach correct moral principles.<ref>Adam Jay Hirsch, ''The Rise of the Penitentiary: Prisons and Punishment in Early America'', New Haven and London (1992).</ref> His religious library was challenged in 1844 when John Edmonds placed [[Eliza Farnham]] in charge of the women's ward at Sing Sing. In 1844, the New York Prison Association was inaugurated to monitor state prison administration. The NY Prison Association was made up of reformers interested in the rehabilitation and humane treatment of prisoners. Farnham was able to obtain the job largely on the recommendation of these reformers.<ref>Floyd, Janet, \"Dislocations of the self: Eliza Farnham at Sing Sing Prison\", ''Journal of American Studies'' (2006), 40(02), p. 311 (311.doi:10,1017/S0021875806001393).</ref> Farnham overturned the strictly silent practice in prison and introduced social engagement to shift concern more toward the future instead of dwelling on the criminal past. She included novels by [[Charles Dickens]] in Chaplain Luckey's religious library, novels the chaplain did not approve. This was the first documented expansion of the prison library to include moral teachings from secular literature.<ref>Vogel, Brenda, and L.

His report of a week-long incognito stay inside New York's [[Auburn Correctional Facility|Auburn Prison]] indicted traditional prison administration in merciless detail.<ref>{{Gutenberg|no=33255|name=Within Prison Walls: Being a Narrative of Personal Experience During a Week of Voluntary Confinement in the State Prison at Auburn, New York|author=[[Thomas Mott Osborne]]|year=1914|bullet=none}}</ref>\n\nPrisoners who had bribed officers and intimidated other inmates lost their privileges under Osborne's regime. One of them conspired with powerful political allies to destroy Osborne's reputation, even succeeding in getting him indicted for a variety of crimes and maladministration.

It was considered a model prison because it turned a profit for the state.<ref name=\"correctionhistory.org\"/> Lynds employed the [[Auburn system]], which imposed absolute silence on the prisoners; the system was enforced by whipping and other punishments. It was John Luckey, the Prison Chaplain around 1843, who held the Principal Keeper of Sing Sing, Elam Lynds, accountable to New York Governor William H. Seward and to President of the Board of Inspectors, John Edmonds, to have Lynds removed. Chaplain Luckey proceeded to create a great religious library. His purpose was to teach correct moral principles.<ref>Adam Jay Hirsch, ''The Rise of the Penitentiary: Prisons and Punishment in Early America'', New Haven and London (1992).</ref> His religious library was challenged in 1844 when John Edmonds placed [[Eliza Farnham]] in charge of the women's ward at Sing Sing. In 1844, the New York Prison Association was inaugurated to monitor state prison administration. The NY Prison Association was made up of reformers interested in the rehabilitation and humane treatment of prisoners. Farnham was able to obtain the job largely on the recommendation of these reformers.<ref>Floyd, Janet, \"Dislocations of the self: Eliza Farnham at Sing Sing Prison\", ''Journal of American Studies'' (2006), 40(02), p. 311 (311.doi:10,1017/S0021875806001393).</ref> Farnham overturned the strictly silent practice in prison and introduced social engagement to shift concern more toward the future instead of dwelling on the criminal past. She included novels by [[Charles Dickens]] in Chaplain Luckey's religious library, novels the chaplain did not approve. This was the first documented expansion of the prison library to include moral teachings from secular literature.<ref>Vogel, Brenda, and L.

His report of a week-long incognito stay inside New York's [[Auburn Correctional Facility|Auburn Prison]] indicted traditional prison administration in merciless detail.<ref>{{Gutenberg|no=33255|name=Within Prison Walls: Being a Narrative of Personal Experience During a Week of Voluntary Confinement in the State Prison at Auburn, New York|author=[[Thomas Mott Osborne]]|year=1914|bullet=none}}</ref>\n\nPrisoners who had bribed officers and intimidated other inmates lost their privileges under Osborne's regime. One of them conspired with powerful political allies to destroy Osborne's reputation, even succeeding in getting him indicted for a variety of crimes and maladministration.

In 1935, the starting quarterback and two other starters escaped the morning before a game.\n\n[[Alabama Pitts]] was their starting QB and star for the first four seasons, but then finished his sentence.

In 1932, \"graduate\" [[Jumbo Morano]] was signed by the Giants, and played for the [[Paterson Nighthawks]] of the [[Eastern Football League (United States)|Eastern Football League]]. In 1934, State Commissioner of Correction, [[Walter N. Thayer]] banned the advertising of activities at the prison, including football games. On November 19, 1936, a new rule banned ticket sales. No revenue would be allowed on admission to shows and sports events. This money was paying for charity for prisoners' families, especially the executed's kin, and for equipment and coaches' salaries. With this new edict, the season ended and prisoners were no longer allowed to play football outside Sing Sing.<ref>''Sing Sing Football Records'': [http://www.luckyshow.org/football/Sing%20Sing.htm \"Sing Sing\"].

Therefore, the agency evaluated the Salafist movement beyond the actions by Salafists and analysed the ideological framework of Salafism which is in conflict with the minimal foundations of a democratic and open society. Salafists calling for the death penalty for [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] is in conflict with freedom of religion. The dualistic view on \"true believers\" and \"false believers\" in practice means people being treated unequally on religious grounds. The call for a religious state in the form of a caliphate means that Salafists reject the [[rule of law]] and the [[Popular sovereignty|sovereignty of the people's rule]].

Such songs can also be used in other ways. One author has made extensive use of them in an effort to explore the feelings behind [[world views]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Worldview Theme Song Book |first=Stephen P. |last=Cook |publisher=Parthenon Books |year=2015 |url=http://www.projectworldview.org/WVSngBookinfo.htm |access-date=2 April 2019 |via=Project Worldview}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nThe purpose of the music is to establish a mood for the show and to provide an audible cue that a particular show is beginning, which was especially useful in the early days of radio (See also [[interval signal]]). In some cases, including ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', both versions of ''Land of the Lost'' ([[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|1974]] and [[Land of the Lost (1991 TV series)|1991]]), ''[[The Nanny]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' the lyrics of the theme song provide some necessary [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] for people unfamiliar with the show.\n\nIn addition, some theme music uses orchestral scores or original music to set the mood for the show, such as the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' theme song, which was drawn from the theme for the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] created by [[Danny Elfman]] and sets the mood for the cartoon. Another example is [[Ron Grainer]]'s [[Doctor Who theme music|theme music for ''Doctor Who'']]. Other shows use remixes or [[Cover version|covers]] of older songs, such as the theme song of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' (1994\u20131998), which featured a reworked cover of the theme song from the classic Spider-Man cartoon from the 1960s. The song was performed by [[Aerosmith]] lead guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]].\n\n==Celebrities==\nIn the early years of radio and television, celebrities often had a [[signature song]] associated with them that became their theme music. Such music would be played when a celebrity was about to appear, often played by a band if the celebrity were appearing on the talk show. For example, [[Bob Hope]]'s theme song, which almost always preceded his appearance, was \"[[Thanks for the Memory]]\". In another example, [[Lucille Ball]]'s theme music was \"[[Hey, Look Me Over (song)|Hey, Look Me Over]]\". Other celebrities will have the theme music played for their most notable role; for example, playing the theme from ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' when [[Harrison Ford]] is the guest.\n\nThe practice of playing specific theme music for a celebrity extends to modern-day television talk shows. If a talk show guest doesn't have theme music, the band will sometimes provide them one, which can often involve surreptitious messages from the band about the celebrity. For example, when politician [[Michele Bachmann]] appeared on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' during her campaign for president, the all-black house band [[The Roots]] played the song [[Lyin' Ass Bitch]], as the band supported opposing candidate [[Barack Obama]]. This controversy led to Fallon allegedly placing the band on \"probation\" for such rudeness, although no punishment or upbraiding of the band was demonstrated to the public.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Television===\n\nTheme music has been a feature of the majority of television programs since the medium's inception, as it was for the ancestral radio shows that provided their inspiration. Programs have used theme music in a large variety of styles, sometimes adapted from existing tunes, and with some composed specifically for the purpose. A few have been released commercially and become popular hits; examples include the title theme from ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', performed and recorded by popular singer [[Frankie Laine]]; the theme to ''[[Happy Days#Theme music|Happy Days]]'' (from 1974\u201384), performed by [[Pratt & McClain]] (in Top 5, 1976); the theme to ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', performed by [[Cyndi Grecco]] (#25, 1976); the theme to ''[[Friends]]'', [[I'll Be There for You (Rembrandts song)|\"I'll Be There For You\"]], which was a hit for [[The Rembrandts]]; the theme from ''[[S.W.A.T. (1975 TV series)|S.W.A.T.]]'', which was a hit for [[Rhythm Heritage]], the theme song from ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' (known as \"Pok\u00e9mon Theme\" in the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon 2.B.A. Master|2.B.A. Master]]'' soundtrack), which is a long time hit for [[Jason Paige]], and the theme song from ''[[Drake & Josh]]'', \"[[Found a Way]]\", which was a hit for [[Drake Bell]]. The theme song from ''[[iCarly]]'', \"[[Leave It All To Me]]\", was a hit for [[Miranda Cosgrove]] and features her Drake & Josh co-star Drake Bell, hitting number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. [[Jan Hammer]] had a major hit with the theme from ''[[Miami Vice]]'' in the 1980s. \"[[Theme from Dr. Kildare (Three Stars Will Shine Tonight)|Theme From ''Dr. Kildare'' (Three Stars Will Shine Tonight)]]\", recorded by [[Richard Chamberlain]], the star of the television series, was in 1962 a top 10 hit in the U.S. and a top 20 in the UK and [[Believe It or Not (song)|Believe It or Not]], from [[The Greatest American Hero]], a #2 hit for [[Joey Scarbury]] in 1981. The theme to the anime [[Baka and Test]], \"Perfect-area Complete!\" was a hit for [[Natsuko Aso]], peaking at number 18 on the [[Oricon Singles Chart]].\n\nOther themes, like the music for ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', and ''[[Coronation Street]]'' have become iconic mostly due to the shows' respective longevities. Unlike others, these serials have not strayed from the original theme mix much, if at all, allowing them to be known by multiple generations of television viewers.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, iconic sports shows have such strong associations with their theme music that the sports themselves are synonymous with the theme tunes, such as [[Association football|football]] (The ''[[Match of the Day]]'', ''[[Grandstand (TV programme)|Grandstand]]'' and ''[[The Big Match|Big Match]] theme tunes), [[cricket]] (\"[[Soul Limbo]]\" by [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]], \"Soul Limbo\"), [[motor racing]] (Roger Barsotti's ''Motor Sport'' and the bassline from [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s \"[[The Chain]]\"), [[tennis]] ([[Keith Mansfield]]'s \"Light and Tuneful\"), [[snooker]] (\"[[Drag Racer (song)|Drag Racer]]\" by the [[Doug Wood Band]]), [[skiing]] (\"Pop Goes Bach\", the theme to [[Ski Sunday]]) and [[gaelic games]] (\"J\u00e4gerlatein\" by [[James Last]]). Themes in the United States that have become associated with a sport include [[Johnny Pearson]]'s \"[[Heavy Action]]\" (used for many years as an intro to ''[[Monday Night Football]]''), \"[[Roundball Rock]]\" (composed by [[John Tesh]] as the theme for the [[NBA on NBC]] during the 1990s and early 2000s, and for CBB on FOX from 2018/19 - present and Jr. NBA Championships 2019\u2013present), \"[[Bugler's Dream]]\" (used in ABC and NBC's coverage of the [[Olympics]]) and the theme to [[ESPN]]'s sports highlight show, ''[[SportsCenter]]''. A notable theme that was once associated with a sport, but because of its popularity, spread network-wide was the ''[[NFL on Fox]]'' theme, which is now used for [[MLB on Fox]] (2010\u2013Present) and [[NASCAR on Fox]] (2011-2015) and UFC on FOX (2012-2018) and PBC on FOX (Dec 2018 to July/August 2019) and Jr. NBA Championships (unknown-2018) broadcasts, and is regarded as the network's single theme by October 2010. CBS's longtime March Madness theme is considered one of the masterpieces of Americans sports theme music, said to deliver a euphoric feeling to many sports fans. In Canada, the soaring backbeats of the [[Hockey Night in Canada]] theme, \"[[The Hockey Theme]]\", became so iconic that the piece was sometimes called Canada's second national anthem. It became something of a national scandal when broadcaster [[CBC Television]] lost the rights to use the theme in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Canada's 'second national anthem' silenced after nearly 40 year run |url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=e65c002d-feda-4347-9f84-d5e6954bcf4e |access-date=2 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324102232/http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=e65c002d-feda-4347-9f84-d5e6954bcf4e |archive-date=24 March 2016 |work=[[Canwest News Service]] |date=5 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nMost television shows have specific, melodic theme music, even if just a few notes (such as the clip of music that fades in and out in the title sequence for ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', or the pulsing sound of helicopter blades in the theme music for ''[[Airwolf Themes|Airwolf]]''). One exception is ''[[60 Minutes]]'', which features only the ticking hand of a [[TAG Heuer|Heuer]] [[stopwatch]]. Another recent exception is ''[[Body of Proof]]'' which has no theme song, and barely even has a title sequence.\n\n===Remixes===\nNotable is the ''[[Law & Order]]'' series, which started out with one theme song for ''Law & Order'', and remixed it for its four spinoffs (''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Trial by Jury]]'' and ''[[Law & Order: LA]]''). The related shows ''[[Crime & Punishment]]'', ''[[New York Undercover]]''. ''[[Arrest & Trial]]'' and ''[[Stars Earn Stripes]]'' also aired with a remix of the theme.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n''[[CSI: NY]]'' uses the first strophe of \"[[Baba O'Riley]]\" for its opening sequence, but with a remixed version of the instrumental track.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Radio===\n{{see also|Bumper music}}\nRadio programs with notable theme music include ''[[Just a Minute]]'', which uses a high-speed rendition of the ''[[Minute Waltz]]'' by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]; ''[[The Archers]]'', which has ''[[Barwick Green]]''; ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' which has ''[[By the Sleepy Lagoon]]'', and ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', which uses the instrumental from \"[[My City Was Gone]].\"\n\nIn [[talk radio]], a different theme song is often used to introduce each segment, and the music (usually popular music of some sort) will often relate to the topic being discussed. [[John Batchelor]] is noted for his use of highly dramatic orchestral scores leading in and out of each segment of his weekly show.\n\n===Video games===\n{{Main|Video game music}}\n\nMany video games feature a theme song that is distinctive to the series. A popular one to date is the \"[[Music of the Final Fantasy series#Themes|Prelude Theme]]\" from the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, which is played on most, if not all, of the title screens of the original games, most notably ''[[Final Fantasy I]]'' to ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. The newer ones also feature the theme, albeit usually modernized, and played during the ending credits.<ref>{{cite web |quote=Another notable one is the theme music that has played in either the title screen or opening scene of the main series [[Pok\u00e9mon]] games, which slightly changes with each generation. |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec2.html |title=The History of Final Fantasy |work=[[GameSpot.com]] |access-date=2 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709115341/http://www.gamespot.com:80/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec2.html |archive-date=9 July 2006 |publisher=[[CNET Networks, Inc.]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.ps2.ign.com/articles/756/756635p1.html |title=The Evolution of Final Fantasy: From I to XII, we catch you up on the facts. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812000715/http://au.ps2.ign.com/articles/756/756635p1.html |archive-date=12 August 2011 |url-status=dead |location=Australia |date=January 19, 2007 |access-date=2 April 2019 |work=[[IGN]] |first=Patrick |last=Kolan}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bumper music]]\n* [[List of television theme music]]\n* [[Show tune]]\n* [[Signature song]]\n* [[Television news music]]\n* [[Trademark look]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.musicalmoods.org/ BBC Theme music experiment]\n* [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/page/Television_music Oxford Music Online: Television music]\n* [https://www.colorlab.ml/2020s-best-free-music-wordpress-theme-colorlab/ ColorLab-Free Music WP Theme]\n{{Singing}}\n\n[[Category:Radio broadcasting]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:Theme music| ]]\n[[Category:Sports music]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Subject (music)}}\n'''Theme music''' is a [[musical composition|piece]] that is often written specifically for a [[radio programming|radio program]], [[television program]], [[video game]], or [[movie]] and is usually played during the [[title sequence|intro]], [[opening credits]], and/or [[ending credits]].<ref>{{cite dictionary |last=Reitz |first=Joan M. |dictionary=Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |url=https://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_t.aspx |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |access-date=3 February 2018 |title=theme song |year=2004-2014}}</ref>\n\nThe phrase '''theme song''' or '''signature tune''' may also be used to refer to a [[signature song]] that has become especially associated with a particular performer or dignitary, often used as they make an entrance.\nThe purpose of a theme song is often similar to that of a [[leitmotif]].

This controversy led to Fallon allegedly placing the band on \"probation\" for such rudeness, although no punishment or upbraiding of the band was demonstrated to the public.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Television===\n\nTheme music has been a feature of the majority of television programs since the medium's inception, as it was for the ancestral radio shows that provided their inspiration. Programs have used theme music in a large variety of styles, sometimes adapted from existing tunes, and with some composed specifically for the purpose. A few have been released commercially and become popular hits; examples include the title theme from ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', performed and recorded by popular singer [[Frankie Laine]]; the theme to ''[[Happy Days#Theme music|Happy Days]]'' (from 1974\u201384), performed by [[Pratt & McClain]] (in Top 5, 1976); the theme to ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', performed by [[Cyndi Grecco]] (#25, 1976); the theme to ''[[Friends]]'', [[I'll Be There for You (Rembrandts song)|\"I'll Be There For You\"]], which was a hit for [[The Rembrandts]]; the theme from ''[[S.W.A.T. (1975 TV series)|S.W.A.T.]]'', which was a hit for [[Rhythm Heritage]], the theme song from ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' (known as \"Pok\u00e9mon Theme\" in the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon 2.B.A. Master|2.B.A. Master]]'' soundtrack), which is a long time hit for [[Jason Paige]], and the theme song from ''[[Drake & Josh]]'', \"[[Found a Way]]\", which was a hit for [[Drake Bell]]. The theme song from ''[[iCarly]]'', \"[[Leave It All To Me]]\", was a hit for [[Miranda Cosgrove]] and features her Drake & Josh co-star Drake Bell, hitting number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. [[Jan Hammer]] had a major hit with the theme from ''[[Miami Vice]]'' in the 1980s. \"[[Theme from Dr. Kildare (Three Stars Will Shine Tonight)|Theme From ''Dr. Kildare'' (Three Stars Will Shine Tonight)]]\", recorded by [[Richard Chamberlain]], the star of the television series, was in 1962 a top 10 hit in the U.S. and a top 20 in the UK and [[Believe It or Not (song)|Believe It or Not]], from [[The Greatest American Hero]], a #2 hit for [[Joey Scarbury]] in 1981. The theme to the anime [[Baka and Test]], \"Perfect-area Complete!\" was a hit for [[Natsuko Aso]], peaking at number 18 on the [[Oricon Singles Chart]].\n\nOther themes, like the music for ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', and ''[[Coronation Street]]'' have become iconic mostly due to the shows' respective longevities. Unlike others, these serials have not strayed from the original theme mix much, if at all, allowing them to be known by multiple generations of television viewers.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, iconic sports shows have such strong associations with their theme music that the sports themselves are synonymous with the theme tunes, such as [[Association football|football]] (The ''[[Match of the Day]]'', ''[[Grandstand (TV programme)|Grandstand]]'' and ''[[The Big Match|Big Match]] theme tunes), [[cricket]] (\"[[Soul Limbo]]\" by [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]], \"Soul Limbo\"), [[motor racing]] (Roger Barsotti's ''Motor Sport'' and the bassline from [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s \"[[The Chain]]\"), [[tennis]] ([[Keith Mansfield]]'s \"Light and Tuneful\"), [[snooker]] (\"[[Drag Racer (song)|Drag Racer]]\" by the [[Doug Wood Band]]), [[skiing]] (\"Pop Goes Bach\", the theme to [[Ski Sunday]]) and [[gaelic games]] (\"J\u00e4gerlatein\" by [[James Last]]). Themes in the United States that have become associated with a sport include [[Johnny Pearson]]'s \"[[Heavy Action]]\" (used for many years as an intro to ''[[Monday Night Football]]''), \"[[Roundball Rock]]\" (composed by [[John Tesh]] as the theme for the [[NBA on NBC]] during the 1990s and early 2000s, and for CBB on FOX from 2018/19 - present and Jr. NBA Championships 2019\u2013present), \"[[Bugler's Dream]]\" (used in ABC and NBC's coverage of the [[Olympics]]) and the theme to [[ESPN]]'s sports highlight show, ''[[SportsCenter]]''. A notable theme that was once associated with a sport, but because of its popularity, spread network-wide was the ''[[NFL on Fox]]'' theme, which is now used for [[MLB on Fox]] (2010\u2013Present) and [[NASCAR on Fox]] (2011-2015) and UFC on FOX (2012-2018) and PBC on FOX (Dec 2018 to July/August 2019) and Jr. NBA Championships (unknown-2018) broadcasts, and is regarded as the network's single theme by October 2010. CBS's longtime March Madness theme is considered one of the masterpieces of Americans sports theme music, said to deliver a euphoric feeling to many sports fans. In Canada, the soaring backbeats of the [[Hockey Night in Canada]] theme, \"[[The Hockey Theme]]\", became so iconic that the piece was sometimes called Canada's second national anthem. It became something of a national scandal when broadcaster [[CBC Television]] lost the rights to use the theme in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Canada's 'second national anthem' silenced after nearly 40 year run |url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=e65c002d-feda-4347-9f84-d5e6954bcf4e |access-date=2 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324102232/http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=e65c002d-feda-4347-9f84-d5e6954bcf4e |archive-date=24 March 2016 |work=[[Canwest News Service]] |date=5 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nMost television shows have specific, melodic theme music, even if just a few notes (such as the clip of music that fades in and out in the title sequence for ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', or the pulsing sound of helicopter blades in the theme music for ''[[Airwolf Themes|Airwolf]]''). One exception is ''[[60 Minutes]]'', which features only the ticking hand of a [[TAG Heuer|Heuer]] [[stopwatch]]. Another recent exception is ''[[Body of Proof]]'' which has no theme song, and barely even has a title sequence.\n\n===Remixes===\nNotable is the ''[[Law & Order]]'' series, which started out with one theme song for ''Law & Order'', and remixed it for its four spinoffs (''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Trial by Jury]]'' and ''[[Law & Order: LA]]''). The related shows ''[[Crime & Punishment]]'', ''[[New York Undercover]]''. ''[[Arrest & Trial]]'' and ''[[Stars Earn Stripes]]'' also aired with a remix of the theme.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n''[[CSI: NY]]'' uses the first strophe of \"[[Baba O'Riley]]\" for its opening sequence, but with a remixed version of the instrumental track.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Radio===\n{{see also|Bumper music}}\nRadio programs with notable theme music include ''[[Just a Minute]]'', which uses a high-speed rendition of the ''[[Minute Waltz]]'' by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]; ''[[The Archers]]'', which has ''[[Barwick Green]]''; ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' which has ''[[By the Sleepy Lagoon]]'', and ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', which uses the instrumental from \"[[My City Was Gone]].\"\n\nIn [[talk radio]], a different theme song is often used to introduce each segment, and the music (usually popular music of some sort) will often relate to the topic being discussed. [[John Batchelor]] is noted for his use of highly dramatic orchestral scores leading in and out of each segment of his weekly show.\n\n===Video games===\n{{Main|Video game music}}\n\nMany video games feature a theme song that is distinctive to the series. A popular one to date is the \"[[Music of the Final Fantasy series#Themes|Prelude Theme]]\" from the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, which is played on most, if not all, of the title screens of the original games, most notably ''[[Final Fantasy I]]'' to ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. The newer ones also feature the theme, albeit usually modernized, and played during the ending credits.<ref>{{cite web |quote=Another notable one is the theme music that has played in either the title screen or opening scene of the main series [[Pok\u00e9mon]] games, which slightly changes with each generation. |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec2.html |title=The History of Final Fantasy |work=[[GameSpot.com]] |access-date=2 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709115341/http://www.gamespot.com:80/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec2.html |archive-date=9 July 2006 |publisher=[[CNET Networks, Inc.]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.ps2.ign.com/articles/756/756635p1.html |title=The Evolution of Final Fantasy: From I to XII, we catch you up on the facts. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812000715/http://au.ps2.ign.com/articles/756/756635p1.html |archive-date=12 August 2011 |url-status=dead |location=Australia |date=January 19, 2007 |access-date=2 April 2019 |work=[[IGN]] |first=Patrick |last=Kolan}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bumper music]]\n* [[List of television theme music]]\n* [[Show tune]]\n* [[Signature song]]\n* [[Television news music]]\n* [[Trademark look]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.musicalmoods.org/ BBC Theme music experiment]\n* [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/page/Television_music Oxford Music Online: Television music]\n\n{{Singing}}\n\n[[Category:Radio broadcasting]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:Theme music| ]]\n[[Category:Sports music]]\n", "name_user": "Colorlabrohit", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_music"}
