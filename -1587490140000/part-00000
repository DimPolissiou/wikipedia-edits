During the period of [[Kingdom of Greece|monarchy]] between 1935\u20131973 the force was known as the '''Royal Hellenic Air Force''' ('''RHAF''') (Greek: {{lang|grc|\u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u1f08\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}}, ''Ellinik\u00ed Vasilik\u00ed Aeropor\u00eda'').\n\nThe Hellenic Air Force is one of the three branches of the [[Military of Greece|Hellenic Armed Forces]] and its mission is to guard and protect Greek airspace, provide air assistance and support to the [[Hellenic Army]] and the [[Hellenic Navy]], as well as the provision of humanitarian aid in Greece and around the world. The Hellenic Air Force includes approximately 33,000 active troops, of whom 11,750 are career officers, 14,000 are professional conscripts (\u0395\u03a0.\u039f\u03a0.), 7,250 are volunteer conscripts and 1,100 are women. The motto of the Hellenic Air Force is the [[ancient Greek]] phrase {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f30\u1f72\u03bd \u1f59\u03c8\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd}} (''Ai\u00e8n Hypsikrate\u00een'', \"Always Dominate the Heights\"), and the HAF ensign represents a flying eagle in front of the Hellenic Air Force roundel.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Hellenic Air Force}}\n\n===Origins===\n\nIn 1911, the Greek Government appointed French specialists to form the '''Hellenic Aviation Service'''. Six Greek officers were sent to France for training, while the first four Farman type aircraft were ordered. All six graduated from the Farman school in [[\u00c9tampes]] near [[Paris]], but only four subsequently served in aviation. The first Greek civilian aviator that was given military rank was [[Emmanuel Argyropoulos]], who flew in a [[Nieuport]] IV.G. \"Alkyon\" aircraft, on February 8, 1912. The first military flight was made on May 13, 1912 by Lieutenant [[Dimitrios Kamberos]]. In June, Kamberos flew with the \"Daedalus\", a [[Farman Aviation Works]] aircraft that had been converted into a [[seaplane]], setting a new average speed world record at {{convert|110|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. In September of the same year the [[Greek Army]] fielded its first squadron, the \"Aviators Company\" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''\u039b\u03cc\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd'').\n\n===Balkan Wars and aftermath (1912\u20131930)===\n[[File:Greek aviators in Constaninople 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Greek aviators at the [[San Stefano]] airfield, after the [[Mudros armistice]]]]\n\nOn October 5, 1912, Kamberos flew the first combat mission, a [[reconnaissance]] flight over [[Thessaly]]. This was on the first day of the [[Balkan wars]]. On the same day a similar mission was flown by [[Germany|German]] mercenaries in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] service, over the Thrace front against the [[Bulgaria]]n Army. The Greek and the Ottoman missions, coincidentally flown on the same day, were the first military aviation missions in the history of conventional war. As a matter of fact, all Balkan countries used military aircraft and foreign mercenaries during the Balkan Wars.\n\nJanuary 24, 1913 saw the first naval co-operation mission in history, which took place over the [[Dardanelles]]. Aided by the [[Hellenic Navy|Royal Hellenic Navy]] destroyer RHNS {{ship|Greek destroyer|Velos|1907|2}}, 1st Lieutenant [[Michael Moutoussis]] and Ensign [[Aristeidis Moraitinis (aviator)|Aristeidis Moraitinis]] flew the Farman hydroplane and drew up a diagram of the positions of the Turkish fleet, against which they dropped four bombs. This was not the first air-to-ground attack in military history, as there was a precedent in the Turkish-Italian war of 1911, but the first recorded attack against ships from the air.\n\nInitially, the [[Hellenic Army]] and the Royal Hellenic Navy operated separate Army Aviation and Naval Aviation units. During the Balkan Wars, various French Henry and Maurice Farman aircraft types were used. The [[Hellenic Naval Air Service]] was officially founded in 1914 by the then Commander in Chief (CnC) of the Royal Hellenic Navy, British [[Mark Kerr (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Mark Kerr]]. Greek aviation units participated in [[World War I]] and the [[Asia Minor Campaign]], equipped by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] with a variety of French and British designs.\n\n===Foundation, World War II and Civil War (1930\u20131950)===\n[[File:335 (Hellenic) Squadron RAF Hurricane pilots Egypt WWII IWM CM 3362.jpg|thumb|left|Greek pilots of the [[335th Squadron (HAF)|335th Fighter Squadron]] in Egypt, 1942]]\n\nIn 1930 the Aviation Ministry was founded, establishing the Air Force as the third branch of the [[Hellenic Armed Forces]]. The Hellenic Army Air Service and Hellenic Naval Air Service were merged into a single service, the Royal Hellenic Air Force. In 1931 the [[Hellenic Air Force Academy]], the ''[[Icarus]] School'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''\u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u0399\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd''), was founded.\n\nIn 1939, an order for 24 [[Bloch MB.150|Marcel Bloch MB.151]] fighter aircraft was placed, but only 9 of the aircraft reached Greece, since the outbreak of [[World War II]] prevented the French from completing the order. The aircraft entered service in the 24th Pursuit Squadron (MD \u2013 ''Moira Dioxis'') of the Air Force.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Greece|Italian invasion of Greece (1940)]] in the Second World War, although being severely outnumbered and counting only 79 aircraft against 380 fighters and bombers of the Italian [[Regia Aeronautica]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Piekalkiewicz |first1=Janusz |last2=Van Heurck |first2=Jan |title=The air war, 1939\u20131945 |publisher=Blandford Press |year=1985 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcR8AAAAIAAJ&q=Mitralexis&dq=Mitralexis |isbn=978-0-918678-05-8 |access-date=March 25, 2016}}</ref> RHAF managed to successfully resist the assault. On October 30, two days after the start of the war, there was the first air battle. Some [[Henschel Hs 126|Henschel Hs126s]] of 3/2 Flight of 3 Observation ''Mira'' took off to locate Italian Army columns. But they were intercepted and attacked by [[Fiat CR.42]]s of 393<sup>a</sup> ''Squadriglia''. A first Henschel was hit and crashed, killing its observer, [[Pilot Officer]] Evanghelos Giannaris, the first Greek [[aviator]] to die in the war. A second Hs 126 was downed over [[Mount Smolikas]], killing Pilot Officer Lazaros Papamichail and [[Sergeant]] Constantine Yemenetzis.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Carr |first1=John |title=On Spartan Wings |publisher=Barnsley, SY, Pens & Sword Military |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-84884-798-9|page=4}}</ref> On November 2, 1940, a [[Breguet 19]] intercepted the [[3 Alpine Division Julia]] while it was penetrating the [[Pindos]] mountain range in an attempt to occupy [[Metsovo]].

During the [[Greco-Italian War]] the Hellenic Air Force shot down 68 enemy aircraft (official records) and claimed another 24. The [[Royal Air Force|British RAF]] claimed 150 additional air victories against Italian aircraft. However surprisingly, the Italian Air Force recorded only 65 aircraft lost, during the entire campaign against the Greeks and later the British, with 495 additional aircraft reported as damaged.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Carr |first1=John |title=On Spartan Wings |publisher=Barnsley, SY, Pens & Sword Military |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-84884-798-9|page=171}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1941, the [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] invaded Greece in order to assist the Italian assault. During this second wave of foreign invasion, the [[Luftwaffe]] eventually succeeded in destroying almost the entire Hellenic Air Force.

Three squadrons were built, operating under the command of the British [[RAF]]. These squadrons were the [[13th Squadron (HAF)|13th Light Bombing Squadron]] flying [[Avro Anson]]s, [[Bristol Blenheim]]s and [[Martin Baltimore]]s and the [[335th Squadron (HAF)|335]] and [[336th Bomber Squadron (HAF)|336]] Fighting Squadrons flying [[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Hurricane I and IIs]] and [[Spitfire|Spitfire V]] types. The RHAF squadrons in the Middle East flew a variety of missions, including convoy patrols, antisubmarine search, offensive patrols, reconnaissance, attack and interception of enemy aircraft. In Summer 1943, the Greek squadrons participated in the attack against the German Wehrmacht on the island of [[Crete]] and then from May to November 1944 in Italy. During those years, 70 Greek pilots were lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_7.asp |title=Hellenic Air Force History \u2013 Middle East;\u2014 |publisher=www.haf.gr |accessdate=February 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718032240/http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_7.asp |archive-date=July 18, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nDuring World War II Greek pilots who were flying with the RAF achieved many victories. [[Rhodesia]]n-born Wing Commander [[Johnny Plagis|John Agorastos Plagis]] shot down 16 enemy aircraft over Malta and Western Europe. Lieutenant Vasilios Michael Vassiliadis was credited with 11.5 enemy aircraft over Western Europe before he was killed in action on March 15, 1945 over Germany. [[Steve Pisanos]], an immigrant to the US in 1938, joined an [[Eagle Squadron]] of American volunteers in the RAF and fought over Western Europe. He later joined the USAAF and acquired US citizenship and continued to fly with the same squadron, now part of the [[4th Operations Group#World War II|USAF 4th FG]]. He had achieved 10 victories with the USAAF by 1944.\n\nAfter Greece's liberation in 1944, RHAF returned to Greece and subsequently played a decisive role in the [[Greek Civil War]], which lasted until 1950. By then, it was re-equipped with [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk IX, Spitfire Mk XVI fighters and [[Curtiss SB2C Helldiver]] bombers.\n\n===Post-war developments (1950\u20131970)===\n[[File:Royal Hellenic Air Force C-47 in 1953.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Douglas C-47 Dakota]] of the Royal Hellenic Air Force in 1953]]\n[[File:RF-84F Thunderflash (14064991190).jpg|thumb|right|Hellenic Air Force RF-84F Thunderflash in 1988.]]\n\nAfter the end of the Greek Civil War in November 1950, Greece sent 7 [[Douglas C-47 Dakota]] transport aircraft of the 13th Transport Aircraft Squadron to [[South Korea]] to assist the [[United Nations]]. Greek aircraft operated in Korea until May 1955. Greek pilots flew thousands of missions including air evacuations, personnel transport, intelligence gathering, and supply flights. In 1952 Greece joined [[NATO]] and the Air Force was rebuilt and organized according to NATO standards. New aircraft, including jets, were introduced.\n\nThe first jet fighter flown by the RHAF was the [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|Republic F-84G Thunderjet]] in 1955. It was also flown by the first Air Force aerobatic team 337 SQ \u201cHellenic Flame\u201d ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a6\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b1). The RF-84F entered service with the 348 Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in 1956. Although the F-84G was replaced by the [[Canadair Sabre|Canadair Sabre 2]] in 1954 and 1955 after 100 units were retired from the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and upgraded in the [[United Kingdom]] before entering service with the RHAF, the RF-84F remained in service until 1991. The [[Lockheed T-33]] was also delivered as a trainer in 1955. Some RT-33s were used for reconnaissance missions.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the RHAF acquired new jet aircraft. These included the [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger]] (in service 1969\u20131975), the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|Lockheed F-104G Starfighter]] and the [[Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter]].  The F-104 and F-5 stayed in service until the mid- to late 1980s.\n\nIn the mid-1970s the Hellenic Air Force was further modernized with deliveries of the [[Dassault Mirage F1|Dassault Mirage F1CG]] fleet, the [[Vought A-7 Corsair II]] (including a number of TA-7Hs) and the first batch of [[McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]s.\n\nIn 1993, the [[United States Air Force]] delivered 62 additional A-7Es and TA-7Cs increasing further the air-to-ground capabilities of the HAF.

Greece saw this as another pro-Turkish move by NATO and withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure from 1974 to 1980.\n\nIn March 1985 the Greek government announced the purchase of 34 F-16C and 6 F-16D [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16C/D Block 30/32|Block 30 variant]] in the \u201cPeace Xenia I\u201d modernisation program.

The estimated cost of this order was $160 million. In addition, past budget cuts, although did not have any significant impact on HAF capabilities, delayed some long-awaited programs for the future. The HAF modernization program estimated in 2007 that a purchase of 45 advance training aircraft, 15 SAR helicopters and 40\u201360 new fighters was necessary.

In its early years however, the Air Force was considered politically right-wing and royalist. Nevertheless, its officer corps proved to be the most politically left-wing of the Armed Forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Thanos Veremis, The military in Greek politics: from independence to democracy, 1997</ref> During the [[Greek Civil War]], the officers of the [[Greek Army]] denounced their Air Force counterparts as \"leftists\" and \"communists\" and considered them disloyal and unreliable.<ref>Amikam Nachmani, International intervention in the Greek Civil War: the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans 1947\u20131952, 1990</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Regime of the Colonels|Coup of the Colonels (1967\u20131974)]] the Air Force aided [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II]] in his failed countercoup of December 1967 and many leading Air Force senior officers were tortured by the [[Greek Military Police|ESA]] men of [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]]. The only Air Force officer that had a significant role in the dictatorial regime was Antonis Skarmaliorakis.\n\nAfter [[Andreas Papandreou]] and his [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) rose to power in 1981, ending a long conservative dominance in Greek politics, Air Force officers were proven to be among Papandreou's most enthusiastic supporters in the Armed Forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Prime Minister Papandreou returned the \u201cfavor\u201d and in 1984 he made an Air Force Marshal, Chief of the [[Hellenic National Defense General Staff]] making this the first time someone from the Air Force rose to occupy this position.\n\nIn international politics, the antagonism between Greece and Turkey has made it imperative for HAF to maintain quantitative and qualitative balance. For years, more frequently than not, HAF and [[Turkish Air Force|TAF]] pilots have engaged in mock [[dogfights]] over the Aegean sea. Due to [[Greek economic crisis|Greece's previous economic problems]] it became less likely for HAF to purchase additional advanced fighters as originally planned.

HAF aircraft have to be able to reach the island and remain over Cypriot airspace for prolonged periods of time and possibly under combat conditions. The distance between the nearest Greek air base on the island of Crete and Cyprus is about 700&nbsp;km.

However all but one, still operational as of 2019.\n|}\n\n== Aircraft markings and camouflage ==\nThe primary camouflage scheme utilized by the Hellenic Air Force is the ''Aegean Ghost'' ({{lang-el|\u03a6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5}}) scheme.  This is modified slightly for each aircraft type but is standard for all combat and transport aircraft in the inventory.  Some training, search-and-rescue, and firefighting aircraft are colored partially or completely in high-visibility colors for identification and easier location in case of an accident.  The air force also frequently uses colorful commemorative schemes to mark anniversaries and other special occasions or for display purposes.  National markings are applied to all aircraft, with the national roundel consisting of concentric blue, white, and blue rings displayed on the fuselage sides and wing surfaces and a tricolor fin flash of similar blue, white, and blue horizontal stripes on the rudder.  The words ''\u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0391\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1'' (or simply the abbreviation ''\u03a0\u0391'') are applied to the fuselage as well, although this is less common in current schemes.  Aircraft in Aegean Ghost scheme may have low visibility markings applied in which blue is replaced by dark grey and white by light grey.\n\nOriginally, many aircraft in service retained the basic color scheme they were acquired in.  Prior to World War II, combat aircraft were given a green and brown top scheme with white or sky blue underside, similar to the Royal Air Force.  After the war, jet fighter aircraft such as the Sabre and Starfighter would serve in a polished metal scheme.  Later, most aircraft received green and brown camouflage again, consistent with the United States Air Force's South East Asia scheme, referred to as Vietnam camouflage in Greece.  A-7 Corsair IIs would be some of the last aircraft to fly with this scheme, retaining it until their retirement, long after all-over grey schemes had become the normal application for Greek aircraft.  C-130 Hercules transports which used South East Asia early in their careers were repainted in an overall grey theme.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Roundel of Greece.svg|standard roundel\nFile:Fin Flash of Greece.svg|fin flash\n</gallery>\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:050618-F-16-GR-01.jpg|HAF Aegean Ghost camo\nFile:HAFm 7033.jpg|1960s polished metal camo\nFile:Thessaloniki-Mikra 92622 Douglas C-47B Skymaster 355\u00ba Mira.jpg|HAF Forest Green (Vietnam) camo\nFile:Lockheed C-130H Hercules Greece - Air Force, LUX Luxembourg (Findel), Luxembourg PP1283952195.jpg|C-130 NATO Grey scheme\nFile:HAF AS 332 Super Puma.jpg|CSAR orange panels scheme\nFile:greek phantom 7487 lands arp.jpg|Special commemorative scheme\nFile:Greek Air Force F16 Zeus - Royal International Air Tattoo 2015 (19943351632).jpg|Demo Team Zeus special demonstration scheme \n</gallery>\n\n==Aircraft accidents and incidents==\n{{Main|List of aviation accidents and incidents in Greece}}\n\nThe worst accident in the history of the Hellenic Air Force occurred on February 5, 1991 when [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[C-130 Hercules|C-130H Hercules]] s/n 748 crashed into [[Mount Othrys]] during the landing approach to [[Nea Anchialos]].

During the period of [[Kingdom of Greece|monarchy]] between 1935\u20131973 the force was known as the '''Royal Hellenic Air Force''' ('''RHAF''') (Greek: {{lang|grc|\u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u1f08\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}}, ''Ellinik\u00ed Vasilik\u00ed Aeropor\u00eda'').\n\nThe Hellenic Air Force is one of the three branches of the [[Military of Greece|Hellenic Armed Forces]] and its mission is to guard and protect Greek airspace, provide air assistance and support to the [[Hellenic Army]] and the [[Hellenic Navy]], as well as the provision of humanitarian aid in Greece and around the world. The Hellenic Air Force includes approximately 33,000 active troops, of whom 11,750 are career officers, 14,000 are professional conscripts (\u0395\u03a0.\u039f\u03a0.), 7,250 are volunteer conscripts and 1,100 are women. The motto of the Hellenic Air Force is the [[ancient Greek]] phrase {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f30\u1f72\u03bd \u1f59\u03c8\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd}} (''Ai\u00e8n Hypsikrate\u00een'', \"Always Dominate the Heights\"), and the HAF ensign represents a flying eagle in front of the Hellenic Air Force roundel.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Hellenic Air Force}}\n\n===Origins===\n\nIn 1911, the Greek Government appointed French specialists to form the '''Hellenic Aviation Service'''. Six Greek officers were sent to France for training, while the first four Farman type aircraft were ordered. All six graduated from the Farman school in [[\u00c9tampes]] near [[Paris]], but only four subsequently served in aviation. The first Greek civilian aviator that was given military rank was [[Emmanuel Argyropoulos]], who flew in a [[Nieuport]] IV.G. \"Alkyon\" aircraft, on February 8, 1912. The first military flight was made on May 13, 1912 by Lieutenant [[Dimitrios Kamberos]]. In June, Kamberos flew with the \"Daedalus\", a [[Farman Aviation Works]] aircraft that had been converted into a [[seaplane]], setting a new average speed world record at {{convert|110|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. In September of the same year the [[Greek Army]] fielded its first squadron, the \"Aviators Company\" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''\u039b\u03cc\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd'').\n\n===Balkan Wars and aftermath (1912\u20131930)===\n[[File:Greek aviators in Constaninople 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Greek aviators at the [[San Stefano]] airfield, after the [[Mudros armistice]]]]\n\nOn October 5, 1912, Kamberos flew the first combat mission, a [[reconnaissance]] flight over [[Thessaly]]. This was on the first day of the [[Balkan wars]]. On the same day a similar mission was flown by [[Germany|German]] mercenaries in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] service, over the Thrace front against the [[Bulgaria]]n Army. The Greek and the Ottoman missions, coincidentally flown on the same day, were the first military aviation missions in the history of conventional war. As a matter of fact, all Balkan countries used military aircraft and foreign mercenaries during the Balkan Wars.\n\nJanuary 24, 1913 saw the first naval co-operation mission in history, which took place over the [[Dardanelles]]. Aided by the [[Hellenic Navy|Royal Hellenic Navy]] destroyer RHNS {{ship|Greek destroyer|Velos|1907|2}}, 1st Lieutenant [[Michael Moutoussis]] and Ensign [[Aristeidis Moraitinis (aviator)|Aristeidis Moraitinis]] flew the Farman hydroplane and drew up a diagram of the positions of the Turkish fleet, against which they dropped four bombs. This was not the first air-to-ground attack in military history, as there was a precedent in the Turkish-Italian war of 1911, but the first recorded attack against ships from the air.\n\nInitially, the [[Hellenic Army]] and the Royal Hellenic Navy operated separate Army Aviation and Naval Aviation units. During the Balkan Wars, various French Henry and Maurice Farman aircraft types were used. The [[Hellenic Naval Air Service]] was officially founded in 1914 by the then Commander in Chief (CnC) of the Royal Hellenic Navy, British [[Mark Kerr (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Mark Kerr]]. Greek aviation units participated in [[World War I]] and the [[Asia Minor Campaign]], equipped by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] with a variety of French and British designs.\n\n===Foundation, World War II and Civil War (1930\u20131950)===\n[[File:335 (Hellenic) Squadron RAF Hurricane pilots Egypt WWII IWM CM 3362.jpg|thumb|left|Greek pilots of the [[335th Squadron (HAF)|335th Fighter Squadron]] in Egypt, 1942]]\n\nIn 1930 the Aviation Ministry was founded, establishing the Air Force as the third branch of the [[Hellenic Armed Forces]]. The Hellenic Army Air Service and Hellenic Naval Air Service were merged into a single service, the Royal Hellenic Air Force. In 1931 the [[Hellenic Air Force Academy]], the ''[[Icarus]] School'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''\u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u0399\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd''), was founded.\n\nIn 1939, an order for 24 [[Bloch MB.150|Marcel Bloch MB.151]] fighter aircraft was placed, but only 9 of the aircraft reached Greece, since the outbreak of [[World War II]] prevented the French from completing the order. The aircraft entered service in the 24th Pursuit Squadron (MD \u2013 ''Moira Dioxis'') of the Air Force.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Greece|Italian invasion of Greece (1940)]] in the Second World War, although being severely outnumbered and counting only 79 aircraft against 380 fighters and bombers of the Italian [[Regia Aeronautica]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Piekalkiewicz |first1=Janusz |last2=Van Heurck |first2=Jan |title=The air war, 1939\u20131945 |publisher=Blandford Press |year=1985 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcR8AAAAIAAJ&q=Mitralexis&dq=Mitralexis |isbn=978-0-918678-05-8 |access-date=March 25, 2016}}</ref> RHAF managed to successfully resist the assault. On October 30, two days after the start of the war, there was the first air battle. Some [[Henschel Hs 126|Henschel Hs126s]] of 3/2 Flight of 3 Observation ''Mira'' took off to locate Italian Army columns. But they were intercepted and attacked by [[Fiat CR.42]]s of 393<sup>a</sup> ''Squadriglia''. A first Henschel was hit and crashed, killing its observer, [[Pilot Officer]] Evanghelos Giannaris, the first Greek [[aviator]] to die in the war. A second Hs 126 was downed over [[Mount Smolikas]], killing Pilot Officer Lazaros Papamichail and [[Sergeant]] Constantine Yemenetzis.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Carr |first1=John |title=On Spartan Wings |publisher=Barnsley, SY, Pens & Sword Military |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-84884-798-9|page=4}}</ref> On November 2, 1940, a [[Breguet 19]] intercepted the [[3 Alpine Division Julia]] while it was penetrating the [[Pindos]] mountain range in an attempt to occupy [[Metsovo]]. On the same day, 2nd Lieutenant [[Marinos Mitralexis]] having run out of ammunition, aimed the nose of his [[PZL P.24]] right into the tail of an enemy [[CANT Z.1007|Cant Z1007bis]] bomber, smashing the rudder and sending the aircraft out of control.<ref name=\"air war\"/>\n\nAfter 65 days of war the RHAF had lost 31 officers, 7 wounded, plus 4 NCOs killed and 5 wounded.

During the [[Greco-Italian War]] the Hellenic Air Force shot down 68 enemy aircraft (official records) and claimed another 24. The [[Royal Air Force|British RAF]] claimed 150 additional air victories against Italian aircraft. However surprisingly, the Italian Air Force recorded only 65 aircraft lost, during the entire campaign against the Greeks and later the British, with 495 additional aircraft reported as damaged.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Carr |first1=John |title=On Spartan Wings |publisher=Barnsley, SY, Pens & Sword Military |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-84884-798-9|page=171}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1941, the [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] invaded Greece in order to assist the Italian assault. During this second wave of foreign invasion, the [[Luftwaffe]] eventually succeeded in destroying almost the entire Hellenic Air Force.

Three squadrons were built, operating under the command of the British [[RAF]]. These squadrons were the [[13th Squadron (HAF)|13th Light Bombing Squadron]] flying [[Avro Anson]]s, [[Bristol Blenheim]]s and [[Martin Baltimore]]s and the [[335th Squadron (HAF)|335]] and [[336th Bomber Squadron (HAF)|336]] Fighting Squadrons flying [[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Hurricane I and IIs]] and [[Spitfire|Spitfire V]] types. The RHAF squadrons in the Middle East flew a variety of missions, including convoy patrols, antisubmarine search, offensive patrols, reconnaissance, attack and interception of enemy aircraft. In Summer 1943, the Greek squadrons participated in the attack against the German Wehrmacht on the island of [[Crete]] and then from May to November 1944 in Italy. During those years, 70 Greek pilots were lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_7.asp |title=Hellenic Air Force History \u2013 Middle East;\u2014 |publisher=www.haf.gr |accessdate=February 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718032240/http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_7.asp |archive-date=July 18, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nDuring World War II Greek pilots who were flying with the RAF achieved many victories. [[Rhodesia]]n-born Wing Commander [[Johnny Plagis|John Agorastos Plagis]] shot down 16 enemy aircraft over Malta and Western Europe. Lieutenant Vasilios Michael Vassiliadis was credited with 11.5 enemy aircraft over Western Europe before he was killed in action on March 15, 1945 over Germany. [[Steve Pisanos]], an immigrant to the US in 1938, joined an [[Eagle Squadron]] of American volunteers in the RAF and fought over Western Europe. He later joined the USAAF and acquired US citizenship and continued to fly with the same squadron, now part of the [[4th Operations Group#World War II|USAF 4th FG]]. He had achieved 10 victories with the USAAF by 1944.\n\nAfter Greece's liberation in 1944, RHAF returned to Greece and subsequently played a decisive role in the [[Greek Civil War]], which lasted until 1950. By then, it was re-equipped with [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk IX, Spitfire Mk XVI fighters and [[Curtiss SB2C Helldiver]] bombers.\n\n===Post-war developments (1950\u20131970)===\n[[File:Royal Hellenic Air Force C-47 in 1953.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Douglas C-47 Dakota]] of the Royal Hellenic Air Force in 1953]]\n[[File:RF-84F Thunderflash (14064991190).jpg|thumb|right|Hellenic Air Force RF-84F Thunderflash in 1988.]]\n\nAfter the end of the Greek Civil War in November 1950, Greece sent 7 [[Douglas C-47 Dakota]] transport aircraft of the 13th Transport Aircraft Squadron to [[South Korea]] to assist the [[United Nations]]. Greek aircraft operated in Korea until May 1955. Greek pilots flew thousands of missions including air evacuations, personnel transport, intelligence gathering, and supply flights. In 1952 Greece joined [[NATO]] and the Air Force was rebuilt and organized according to NATO standards. New aircraft, including jets, were introduced.\n\nThe first jet fighter flown by the RHAF was the [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|Republic F-84G Thunderjet]] in 1955. It was also flown by the first Air Force aerobatic team 337 SQ \u201cHellenic Flame\u201d ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a6\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b1). The RF-84F entered service with the 348 Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in 1956. Although the F-84G was replaced by the [[Canadair Sabre|Canadair Sabre 2]] in 1954 and 1955 after 100 units were retired from the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and upgraded in the [[United Kingdom]] before entering service with the RHAF, the RF-84F remained in service until 1991. The [[Lockheed T-33]] was also delivered as a trainer in 1955. Some RT-33s were used for reconnaissance missions.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the RHAF acquired new jet aircraft. These included the [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger]] (in service 1969\u20131975), the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|Lockheed F-104G Starfighter]] and the [[Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter]].  The F-104 and F-5 stayed in service until the mid- to late 1980s.\n\nIn the mid-1970s the Hellenic Air Force was further modernized with deliveries of the [[Dassault Mirage F1|Dassault Mirage F1CG]] fleet, the [[Vought A-7 Corsair II]] (including a number of TA-7Hs) and the first batch of [[McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]s.\n\nIn 1993, the [[United States Air Force]] delivered 62 additional A-7Es and TA-7Cs increasing further the air-to-ground capabilities of the HAF. These aircraft remained in service until 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/335mb.asp |title=335 \u039c\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 \u0392\u03bf\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd;\u2014 |publisher=www.haf.gr |accessdate=February 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529113837/http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/335mb.asp |archive-date=May 29, 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n===Modernization (1980\u20131997)===\n[[File:Greek Air Force LTV TA-7G Corsair II departs RIAT Fairford 14thJuly2014 arp.jpg|thumb|right|HAF TA-7C Corsair II departs from the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]], [[England]] (2014)]]\n[[File:Greek F-4 Phantom, Aviano Air Base.jpg|thumb|right|Two Hellenic Air Force F-4E Phantom II departing Aviano Air Base, Italy]]\n\nUntil the late 1980s the Air Force deployed missiles armed with U.S. nuclear warheads using the [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|LTV TA-7C Corsair II]]. As a result of [[Greco-Turkish relations|Greco-Turkish tension]] around the 1974 Turkish invasion of [[Cyprus]], the U.S. removed its nuclear weapons from Greek and Turkish alert units to storage. Greece saw this as another pro-Turkish move by NATO and withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure from 1974 to 1980.\n\nIn March 1985 the Greek government announced the purchase of 34 F-16C and 6 F-16D [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16C/D Block 30/32|Block 30 variant]] in the \u201cPeace Xenia I\u201d modernisation program.

The first aircraft was delivered at [[Andravida Air Base]] in December 2002. This aircraft, which was named \"Princess of Andravida\" (s/n 72-01523), was unique because it did not have the [[M61 Vulcan]] gun installed. All upgraded F-4s were equipped with the new AN/APQ-65YG radar similar to that of the [[F/A-18 Hornet]], a new onboard Mission Control Computer (MCC), a [[Head Up Display]], the [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] Interrogator, [[Multi-function display|Multi Function Displays]] and were also capable of carrying a variety of advanced [[Air-to-air missile|Air-to-Air]] and [[Air-to-ground missile|Air-to-Ground]] missiles. These included the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] (although only the -B edition), the [[AIM-9M]] missile, the AFDS and the entire family of the [[Paveway]] (I, II and III) [[laser-guided bomb]]s.\n\nThese aircraft were the [[F-4 Phantom II#Greece|F-4E Peace Icarus 2000 (PI2000)]] or F-4E Phantom II AUP (Avionics Upgrade Program) variants. Although gradual retirement of F-4 units started in 2017 with view of replacing them with additional new F-16s, as of today these aircraft are still operational in multi-role missions with the 338 Squadron \u201d[[Ares]]\u201d and the 339 Squadron [[Ajax the Great|\"Ajax\u201d]] based in Andravida Air Force Base.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/338mdb.asp |title=338 \u039c\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 \u0394\u03af\u03c9\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u2013 \u0392\u03bf\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd; |publisher=Haf.gr |accessdate=July 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301050709/http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/338mdb.asp |archive-date=March 1, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Recently, according to 338 Squadron \"Ares\" crews, the F-4E Phantom II PI2000(AUP) has been certified for use of [[GBU-27 Paveway III]] [[laser-guided]] bombs, making the aircraft an excellent and modern platform for precision strikes.\n\nIn 2000, Greece decided to purchase a large number of fighters to replace the remaining non-upgraded F-4E Phantoms, a number of A-7 Corsairs, and the fleet of Mirage F1CGs.

The estimated cost of this order was $160 million. In addition, past budget cuts, although did not have any significant impact on HAF capabilities, delayed some long-awaited programs for the future. The HAF modernization program estimated in 2007 that a purchase of 45 advance training aircraft, 15 SAR helicopters and 40\u201360 new fighters was necessary.

In its early years however, the Air Force was considered politically right-wing and royalist. Nevertheless, its officer corps proved to be the most politically left-wing of the Armed Forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Thanos Veremis, The military in Greek politics: from independence to democracy, 1997</ref> During the [[Greek Civil War]], the officers of the [[Greek Army]] denounced their Air Force counterparts as \"leftists\" and \"communists\" and considered them disloyal and unreliable.<ref>Amikam Nachmani, International intervention in the Greek Civil War: the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans 1947\u20131952, 1990</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Regime of the Colonels|Coup of the Colonels (1967\u20131974)]] the Air Force aided [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II]] in his failed countercoup of December 1967 and many leading Air Force senior officers were tortured by the [[Greek Military Police|ESA]] men of [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]]. The only Air Force officer that had a significant role in the dictatorial regime was Antonis Skarmaliorakis.\n\nAfter [[Andreas Papandreou]] and his [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) rose to power in 1981, ending a long conservative dominance in Greek politics, Air Force officers were proven to be among Papandreou's most enthusiastic supporters in the Armed Forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Prime Minister Papandreou returned the \u201cfavor\u201d and in 1984 he made an Air Force Marshal, Chief of the [[Hellenic National Defense General Staff]] making this the first time someone from the Air Force rose to occupy this position.\n\nIn international politics, the antagonism between Greece and Turkey has made it imperative for HAF to maintain quantitative and qualitative balance. For years, more frequently than not, HAF and [[Turkish Air Force|TAF]] pilots have engaged in mock [[dogfights]] over the Aegean sea. Due to [[Greek economic crisis|Greece's previous economic problems]] it became less likely for HAF to purchase additional advanced fighters as originally planned.

HAF aircraft have to be able to reach the island and remain over Cypriot airspace for prolonged periods of time and possibly under combat conditions. The distance between the nearest Greek air base on the island of Crete and Cyprus is about 700&nbsp;km.

All upgraded in 2000 and fleet gradually being withdrawn since 2017. However all but one, still operational as of 2019.\n|}\n\n== Aircraft markings and camouflage ==\nThe primary camouflage scheme utilized by the Hellenic Air Force is the ''Aegean Ghost'' ({{lang-el|\u03a6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5}}) scheme.  This is modified slightly for each aircraft type but is standard for all combat and transport aircraft in the inventory.  Some training, search-and-rescue, and firefighting aircraft are colored partially or completely in high-visibility colors for identification and easier location in case of an accident.  The air force also frequently uses colorful commemorative schemes to mark anniversaries and other special occasions or for display purposes.  National markings are applied to all aircraft, with the national roundel consisting of concentric blue, white, and blue rings displayed on the fuselage sides and wing surfaces and a tricolor fin flash of similar blue, white, and blue horizontal stripes on the rudder.  The words ''\u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0391\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1'' (or simply the abbreviation ''\u03a0\u0391'') are applied to the fuselage as well, although this is less common in current schemes.  Aircraft in Aegean Ghost scheme may have low visibility markings applied in which blue is replaced by dark grey and white by light grey.\n\nOriginally, many aircraft in service retained the basic color scheme they were acquired in.  Prior to World War II, combat aircraft were given a green and brown top scheme with white or sky blue underside, similar to the Royal Air Force.  After the war, jet fighter aircraft such as the Sabre and Starfighter would serve in a polished metal scheme.  Later, most aircraft received green and brown camouflage again, consistent with the United States Air Force's South East Asia scheme, referred to as Vietnam camouflage in Greece.  A-7 Corsair IIs would be some of the last aircraft to fly with this scheme, retaining it until their retirement, long after all-over grey schemes had become the normal application for Greek aircraft.  C-130 Hercules transports which used South East Asia early in their careers were repainted in an overall grey theme.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Roundel of Greece.svg|standard roundel\nFile:Fin Flash of Greece.svg|fin flash\n</gallery>\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:050618-F-16-GR-01.jpg|HAF Aegean Ghost camo\nFile:HAFm 7033.jpg|1960s polished metal camo\nFile:Thessaloniki-Mikra 92622 Douglas C-47B Skymaster 355\u00ba Mira.jpg|HAF Forest Green (Vietnam) camo\nFile:Lockheed C-130H Hercules Greece - Air Force, LUX Luxembourg (Findel), Luxembourg PP1283952195.jpg|C-130 NATO Grey scheme\nFile:HAF AS 332 Super Puma.jpg|CSAR orange panels scheme\nFile:greek phantom 7487 lands arp.jpg|Special commemorative scheme\nFile:Greek Air Force F16 Zeus - Royal International Air Tattoo 2015 (19943351632).jpg|Demo Team Zeus special demonstration scheme \n</gallery>\n\n==Aircraft accidents and incidents==\n{{Main|List of aviation accidents and incidents in Greece}}\n\nThe worst accident in the history of the Hellenic Air Force occurred on February 5, 1991 when [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[C-130 Hercules|C-130H Hercules]] s/n 748 crashed into [[Mount Othrys]] during the landing approach to [[Nea Anchialos]].

To achieve its goal, GAIN mobilises public-private partnerships and provides financial and technical support to deliver nutritious foods to those people most at risk of malnutrition. It is an example of [[multistakeholder governance model|multistakeholder governance]].\n\n==Work==\n\nGAIN works with diverse partners \u2013 governments, UN agencies, [[non-governmental organizations]], and businesses worldwide. As of 2015, GAIN reached an estimated 900 million people including 330 million women, adolescent girls and children 6\u201359 months:\n51% of these were in [[Africa]], 44% in [[Asia]] and 5% in the rest of the world.\n\nGAIN's collective impact approach in the nutrition sector has been recognised by the [[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanford Social Innovation Review.

Fortification of staple foods and condiments is a proven, cost-effective and simple nutrition intervention to tackle micronutrient malnutrition, or the lack of the essential micronutrients people need to grow and live healthy lives. GAIN works with governments to fortify everyday staple foods and condiments such as flour, salt and oil with vitamins and minerals, like iron, vitamin A, iodine and folic acid, that help prevent disease and encourage good health.\n* '''Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition'''. GAIN works to break the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and stunting, by focusing on the first 1,000 days, from conception to 24 months, and supporting improved complementary feeding practices \u2013 within the context of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, and continued breastfeeding to two years of age and beyond. The program in 2014-15 reached over 580,000 women and children, with a cumulative reach since its inception of over 19 million.\n* '''Agriculture and Nutrition'''. GAIN uses the agriculture value chain to identify opportunities for nutrition intervention at each stage \u2013 from food production to storage, processing to distribution, retail, marketing and food preparation. The marketplace is seen as a pivotal entry point for improving dietary diversity.\n* '''Business Partnerships and Alliances'''. GAIN tries to build stakeholder partnerships with governments, civil society and the private sector. The work with businesses take place at the global level and at the local level. In developing countries, GAIN works with the small and medium-sized enterprises that play a crucial role in the local food systems.\n* '''Monitoring Learning and Research'''. Through this unit, the organization seeks to strengthen the impact of its programs through better design and implementation, based on the review, generation, translation, and use of evidence for decision making. The unit also identifies and addresses priority evidence gaps related to programming areas, with the ultimate goal of informing GAIN's strategy, supporting advocacy and contributing to the global evidence base.\n\n==Programs==\n\nGAIN's program portfolio is based on proven and cost-effective approaches. Programs support large-scale [[food fortification]], multi-nutrient supplements, nutritious foods for mothers and children, and enhancement of the nutritional content of agriculture products.\n\n===More nutritious staple foods for populations at large===\nGAIN's [https://web.archive.org/web/20171111205229/https://www.gainhealth.org/programs/initiatives/ Large Scale Food Fortification Program] aims to increase sustainable consumption of staple foods and condiments fortified with essential vitamins and minerals among populations at large in target countries. Key goals include increasing coverage of key [[micronutrients]] (vitamin A, iodine, iron, zinc, [[folic acid]]) to more than 500 million women and children and reduction of key deficiencies by 20\u201330 percent. Projects fortify staple foods and condiments including vegetable oil, maize meal, rice, wheat flour, salt, sugar, soy sauce and fish sauce \u2013 relying on business to fortify products and governments to establish appropriate legislation and regulation.

The focus is placed in particular on the development of adequate delivery models to ensure access to, and demand for and use of, products by target populations.\n\n===Agriculture and nutrition===\nSupporting the production, processing and use of more nutritious agricultural crops and enhancing the quality of staple foods (through improved seeds, fertilizers and milling and storage practices) are two strategies for bringing better nutrition to vulnerable populations in a sustainable way. Taken together these efforts can also increase effective yields for poor farmers and improve their health and livelihoods.\n\nEnsuring that the food system works to improve nutritional value means more than simply increasing production and making sure there is enough food to feed the world's population. Nutritional quality needs to become a measurable objective in agricultural programs, and embedded within the pillars of food security. Strategies for integrating health, nutrition and agriculture are reflected in the [http://www.scalingupnutrition.org/ Scaling Up Nutrition] movement, and are gaining momentum both nationally and in global thinking.\n\n==Building a global nutrition movement==\n\n===Engaging the global community===\nA critical component of GAIN's efforts has been positioning nutrition as central to the global health and development platform, as poor nutrition is clearly an impediment for achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. GAIN supports enhanced advocacy efforts at the national, regional and international levels, to enhance the policy environment to reach scale, raise the profile of nutrition and ultimately increase human and financial resources to address malnutrition.\n\nIn 2011, as part of its expanded advocacy program, GAIN launched [https://web.archive.org/web/20120419005227/http://futurefortified.org/ Future Fortified], a global campaign to improve the nutrition of mothers and children through support for GAIN programs and related global nutrition advocacy efforts.\n\nGAIN is also a strong supporter of the [http://www.scalingupnutrition.org/ Scaling Up Nutrition] movement (SUN) and, together with the [[World Food Programme]], is a co-convener of the [http://sunbusinessnetwork.org/ SUN Business Network]. GAIN joined with partners to establish the [http://www.thousanddays.org/ 1,000 Days Partnership] and supports the implementation of its programs.\n\n===Building public and private partnerships===\nMarket-based approaches to nutrition are an essential part of the way GAIN does business. Over 90 percent of food and beverages in the developed world, and increasingly in emerging markets too, are produced or delivered by the private sector. GAIN engages with the private sector to improve efficiency and effectiveness of markets.\n\nThe SUN Business Network (SBN) co-convened by GAIN and the UN World Food Programme \u2013 is one of the four global networks that support SUN countries \u2013 along with UN, Civil Society and Donor Networks. The SBN was established to bring business together behind the SUN Movement and its aim to ensure that all people realise their right to good food and nutrition. In 2015,the SBN surpassed its target of 99 companies, with 160 now making public commitments to improving nutrition, and tracking their progress annually. These commitments range from increasing reach in\nbroadcasting mobile phone nutrition messages, all the way to providing 60 million people each year with fortified staple foods.In total, commitments from member companies amount to reaching 125 million consumers every year by 2020. The SBN is now supporting ten SUN countries to develop national platforms and strategies to engage business in country-led national nutrition strategies.<ref>http://sunbusinessnetwork.org/business-commitment/</ref>\n\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20110814070133/http://www.gainhealth.org/partnerships/amsterdam-initiative-against-malnutrition-aim Amsterdam Initiative against Malnutrition] (AIM) is a coalition of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], [[Unilever]], [[DSM (company)|DSM]], [[AkzoNobel]], [[Wageningen University]], [[International Cocoa Organization|ICCO]] and GAIN that aims to work with others to end malnutrition in [[Africa]] by 2015 through initially targeting six countries: [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[South Africa]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]] and [[Mozambique]]. In [[Kenya]], AIM has initiated a milk fortification project and a market study to get insight into consumer attitudes towards fortified milk. AIM partners have also identified distribution channels for nutritious foods that reach base of the pyramid populations, including safe water kiosks, milk bars, and school feeding programs. The initiative also began supporting the Kenya Nutritionists and Dieticians Institute, to create demand for nutrition through strengthening capacity development, policy and advocacy, and public engagement. Going forward, AIM will increase focus on market insight and BOP consumer aspirations to ensure nutritious products are not only accessible and affordable, but also in high demand.\n\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20180108235110/https://www.gainhealth.org/about/global-platforms/#gain-nordic-partnership- GAIN Nordic Partnership] is a multi-sector platform with an ambition to facilitate scalable and inclusive business models that enhance the nutritional value of food in developing countries. It was established in 2014 by the five founding partners: [[Arla Foods Ingredients]], [[Tetra Pak]], [[DanChurchAid]], the Confederation of Danish Industry and GAIN. The platform brings together Nordic companies, civil society, academia and the public sector in a forum for collaboration, action and knowledge sharing. Together, we co-create solutions that address undernutrition but at the same time are affordable, tasty and attractive for low income consumers living on a budget of a few dollars a day. The first focus area of the GAIN Nordic Partnership is the development of sustainable initiatives along the dairy value chain in Ethiopia and East Africa.

The index also seeks to promote nutrition as an investible theme within the investment community.<ref>{{cite web|title=About - Access to Nutrition Index (ATNI)|url=http://www.accesstonutrition.org/about-atni|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227080148/http://www.accesstonutrition.org/about-atni|archivedate=2011-12-27}}</ref>\n\n==Operations==\n\n===Where GAIN works===\n\nGAIN currently employs 120+ professionals in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America, who work on various projects in more than 30 countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=GAIN project map from annual report 2011-2012|url=http://www.gainhealth.org/sites/default/files/Project%20map2010-2011.pdf}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Headquartered in [[Geneva, Switzerland]].
