The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented [[glacial striation]]s and deposits called [[tillite]]s, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations that were contiguous with one another.<ref name=wegb />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Geological history of Earth}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|27em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Henry R.|date=2012 |title=The Continental Drift Controversy |volume=Volume I: ''Wegener and the Early Debate'' |publisher=Cambridge |ref=Frankel }}\n*{{Citation\n |first= Homer Eugene\n |last= Le Grand\n |year= 1988\n |title= Drifting Continents and Shifting Theories\n |publisher= Cambridge University\n |isbn= 978-0-521-31105-2\n |ref= none\n |url-access= registration\n |url= https://archive.org/details/driftingcontinen00legr\n }}.\n*{{Citation\n |first= Naomi |last= Oreskes\n |year= 1999\n |title= The Rejection of Continental Drift\n |publisher= Oxford University Press\n |isbn=  978-0-19-511732-5\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EEQdk9GRfkoC&pg=PA14\n |ref= none\n}} (pb: {{ISBNT | 0-19-511733-6 }}).\n*{{Citation\n |first1        = Naomi\n |last1         = Oreskes\n |chapter       = Continental Drift\n |editor1-first = Ted\n |editor1-last  = Munn\n |editor2-first = Michael C.\n |editor2-last  = MacCracken\n |editor3-first = John S.\n |editor3-last  = Perry\n |date          = 2002\n |title         = Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change\n |volume        = Vol. 1\n |pages         = 321\u2013325\n |publisher     = John Wiley & Sons\n |place         = Chichester, West Sussex\n |isbn          = 978-0-471-97796-4\n |oclc          = 633880622\n |chapter-url   = http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |url-status       = dead\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204234030/http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |archivedate   = 4 February 2012\n |df            = dmy-all\n}} <!-- CAUTION: catalogs are inconsistent.
