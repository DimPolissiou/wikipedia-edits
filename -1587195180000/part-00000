Although the climate is so much colder than that of Buenos Ayres, the gauchos sleep in the open air, when in the interior, under their saddles, just as they do in the latitude of 35\u00b0.

With their loose [[poncho]]s, slouched hats, long hair, dark complexions, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] eyes, they are characters fitter for the pencil of an artist than for the quiet hearth of an industrious settler.  Besides these gauchos, we saw five [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] (p. 267), who had been taken by the Buenos Ayrean troops, or their allies, and allowed to leave [[prison]] on condition of going with Mr. [[Luis Vernet|Vernet]] to the Falklands.

Eventually, gauchos took part in the colonization of the uninhabited [[West Falkland]] in the 1860s and 1870s, although by that time many of them were of [[European ethnic groups|European]] origins ([[Scottish People|Scottish]], [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]] etc.).

For instance, the Islanders use 'alizan', 'colorao', 'negro', 'blanco', 'gotiao', 'picasso', 'sarco', 'rabincana' etc. for certain horse colours and looks, or 'bosal', 'cabresta', 'bastos', 'cinch', 'conjinilla', 'meletas', 'tientas', 'manares' etc. for various items of horse gear.<ref name=\"Spruce\" />\n\nUnlike the older [[England|English]], [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] place names given by mariners, which refer mainly to islands, rocks, bays, coves, and capes (points) important for navigation, the post-1833 Spanish names usually identify inland geographical locations and features, reflecting the new practical necessity for orientation, land [[delimitation]] and management in the cattle and sheep farming.  Among the typical such names or descriptive and generic parts of names are 'Rincon Grande', 'Ceritos', 'Campito', 'Cantera', 'Terra Motas', 'Malo River', 'Brasse Mar', 'Dos Lomas', 'Torcida Point', 'Pioja Point', 'Estancia', 'Oroqueta', 'Piedra Sola', 'Laguna Seco', 'Manada', etc.<ref name=\"Spruce\" />\n\n==Late nineteenth to early twentieth century==\nThe development of the sheep-breeding industry in the second half of the 19th century was accompanied by substantial immigration, increasing the population sevenfold in fifty years, from 287 in 1851 to 2,043 in 1901.<ref name=\"Census 2001\">[http://www.falklands.info/background/census2001t.html Falklands Census 2001: Tables.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301063015/http://www.falklands.info/background/census2001t.html |date=1 March 2010 }} Falkland Islands Information Portal.</ref> The vast majority of immigrants during that period came from the [[British Isles]], mostly from Scotland.

Finding a growing need for a minister of their own, they undertook, with the assistance of the Company to employ a minister for Darwin, and in 1872, Rev Yeoman took up the appointment. In 1873, an iron constructed church was brought from England and erected at Darwin. About this time, it was estimated that one third of the Falklands' population belonged to the [[Presbyterian]] church. (...) As Stanley grew, the Darwin minister visited the town occasionally and held services in the infants' school.<ref>Strange, Ian J. ''The Falkland Islands''.

The port was particularly busy during the [[California Gold Rush]], subsiding following the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914.\n\nThe early 20th century brought about a new industry to the region, [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[whaling]] in [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], that supported a transient population varying from few hundred in winter to over 1,000 in summer.  Some Falkland Islanders found employment with South Georgian whaling bases or ships, while some whalers settled in the Falklands to blend into the local populace.  The whalers were predominantly [[Scandinavia]]n ([[Norwegians]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]] and [[Danish people|Danes]]), with a minority of [[British people|Britons]], [[Germans]], and a variety of other [[European ethnic groups|European]] nations.

Finding a growing need for a minister of their own, they undertook, with the assistance of the Company to employ a minister for Darwin, and in 1872, Rev Yeoman took up the appointment. In 1873, an iron constructed church was brought from England and erected at Darwin. About this time, it was estimated that one third of the Falklands' population belonged to the [[Presbyterian]] church. (...) As Stanley grew, the Darwin minister visited the town occasionally and held services in the infants' school.<ref>Strange, Ian J. ''The Falkland Islands''.

The port was particularly busy during the [[California Gold Rush]], subsiding following the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914.\n\nThe early 20th century brought about a new industry to the region, [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[whaling]] in [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], that supported a transient population varying from few hundred in winter to over 1,000 in summer.  Some Falkland Islanders found employment with South Georgian whaling bases or ships, while some whalers settled in the Falklands to blend into the local populace.
