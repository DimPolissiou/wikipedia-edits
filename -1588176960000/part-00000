This article discusses mainly the [[phonology]] of [[Standard French]] of the Parisian dialect. Notable phonological features include its [[uvular r]], [[nasal vowel]]s, and three processes affecting word-final sounds: [[liaison (French)|liaison]], a specific instance of [[sandhi]] in which word-final consonants are not pronounced unless they are followed by a word beginning with a vowel; [[elision (French)|elision]] in which certain instances of {{IPAslink|\u0259}} ([[schwa]]) are elided (such as when final before an initial vowel) and {{wikt-lang|fr|encha\u00eenement}} (resyllabification) in which word-final and word-initial consonants may be moved across a syllable boundary, with syllables crossing word boundaries:\n\nAn example of the various processes is this:\n*Written: ''{{lang|fr|On a laiss\u00e9 la fen\u00eatre ouverte.}}''\n*Meaning: \"We left the window open.\"\n*In isolation: {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303 a l\u025bse la f\u0259n\u025b\u02d0t\u0281 uv\u025b\u0281t/}}\n*Together: {{IPA|[\u0254\u0303.na.l\u025b.se.laf.n\u025b.t\u0281u.v\u025b\u0281t]}}\n\n==Consonants==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+Consonant phonemes of French\n|-\n!colspan=2|\n![[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n![[Dental consonant|Dental]]/<br/>[[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]]\n![[Palato-alveolar consonant|Palato-<br/>alveolar]]\n![[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n![[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n|-\n!colspan=2| [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA link|m}}\n| {{IPA link|n}}\n|\n| {{IPA link|\u0272}}\n| ({{IPA link|\u014b}})\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=2| [[Plosive]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| {{IPA link|p}}\n| {{IPA link|t\u032a|t}}\n|\n|\n| {{IPA link|k}}\n|\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| {{IPA link|b}}\n| {{IPA link|d\u032a|d}}\n|\n|\n| {{IPA link|\u0261}}\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=2| [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| {{IPA link|f}}\n| {{IPA link|s\u032a|s}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0283}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| {{IPA link|v}}\n| {{IPA link|z\u032a|z}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0292}}\n|\n|\n| {{IPA link|\u0281}}\n|-\n!rowspan=2|[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n!{{small|plain}}\n|\n| {{IPA link|l}}\n|\n| {{IPA link|j}}\n|\n|\n|-\n!{{small|[[Labialization|labial]]}}\n|\n|\n|\n| {{IPA link|\u0265}}\n| {{IPA link|w}}\n|\n|}\n\n[[File:Uvular rhotics in Europe.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Distribution of [[Guttural R#French|guttural r]] (such as {{IPA|[\u0281 \u0280 \u03c7]}}) in [[Europe]] in the mid-20th century.<ref>Map based on {{Harvcoltxt|Trudgill|1974|p=220}}</ref>\n{{legend|#8A7248|not usual}}\n{{legend|#A88A8E|only in some educated speech}}\n{{legend|#B893CB|usual in educated speech}}\n{{legend|#73488A|general}}]]\nPhonetic notes:\n* {{IPA|/n, t, d/}} are [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] [[Denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar]] {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|n\u032a}}, {{IPAplink|t\u032a}}, {{IPAplink|d\u032a}}]}},{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=79}}{{sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=192}} while {{IPA|/s, z/}} are dentalised laminal alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|s\u032a}}, {{IPAplink|z\u032a}}]}} (commonly called 'dental'), pronounced with the blade of the tongue very close to the back of the upper front teeth, with the tip resting behind lower front teeth.{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=79}}{{sfnp|Adams|1975|p=288}}\n* Word-final consonants are always released.

The following cases can be identified.{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nThe geminate pronunciation {{IPA|[\u0281\u0281]}} is found in the future and conditional forms of the verbs {{wikt-lang|fr|courir}} ('to run') and {{wikt-lang|fr|mourir}} ('to die'). The conditional form ''il mourrait'' {{IPA|[il.mu\u0281.\u0281\u025b]}} ('he would die'), for example, contrasts with the imperfect form ''il mourait'' {{IPA|[il.mu.\u0281\u025b]}} ('he was dying'). In some other words, most modern speakers have reduced {{IPA|[\u0281\u0281]}} to {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, such as \"il pourrait\" ('he could'). Other verbs that have a double {{angbr|rr}} orthographically in the future and conditional are pronounced with a simple {{IPA|[\u0281]}}: ''il pourra'' ('he will be able to'), ''il verra'' ('he will see').\n\nWhen the prefix {{wikt-lang|fr|in-}} combines with a base that begins with ''n'', the resulting word is sometimes pronounced with a geminate {{IPA|[nn]}} and similarly for the variants of the same prefix ''im-'', ''il-'', ''ir-'': \n* {{wikt-lang|fr|inn\u00e9}} {{IPA|[i(n).ne]}} ('innate')\n* {{wikt-lang|fr|immortel}} {{IPA|[i(m).m\u0254\u0281t\u025bl]}} ('immortal')\n* {{wikt-lang|fr|illisible}} {{IPA|[i(l).li.zibl]}} ('illegible')\n* {{wikt-lang|fr|irresponsable}} {{IPA|[i(\u0281).\u0281\u025bs.p\u0254\u0303.sabl]}} ('irresponsible')\n\nOther cases of optional gemination can be found in words like {{wikt-lang|fr|syllabe}} ('syllable'), {{wikt-lang|fr|grammaire}} ('grammar'), and {{wikt-lang|fr|illusion}} ('illusion'). The pronunciation of such words, in many cases, a [[spelling pronunciation]] varies by speaker and gives rise to widely varying stylistic effects.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Yaguello|1991}}, cited in {{harvcoltxt|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=51}}.</ref> In particular, the gemination of consonants other than the liquids and nasals {{IPA|/m n l \u0281/}} is \"generally considered affected or pedantic\".{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|p=150}} Examples of stylistically marked pronunciations include {{wikt-lang|fr|addition}} {{IPA|[ad.di.sj\u0254\u0303]}} ('addition') and {{wikt-lang|fr|intelligence}} {{IPA|[\u025b\u0303.t\u025bl.li.\u0292\u0251\u0303s]}} ('intelligence').\n\nGemination of doubled {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}} is typical of the [[Languedoc]] region, as opposed to other southern accents.\n\nA few cases of gemination do not correspond to double consonant letters in the orthography.{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=151\u2013153}} The deletion of word-internal schwas (see below), for example, can give rise to sequences of identical consonants: ''l\u00e0-dedans'' {{IPA|[lad.d\u0251\u0303]}} ('inside'), ''l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9''  {{IPA|[l\u0254.n\u025bt.te]}} ('honesty'). The elided form of the object pronoun ''l<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' ('him/her/it') is also realised as a geminate {{IPA|[ll]}} when it appears after another ''l'' to avoid misunderstanding:\n*''Il l'a mang\u00e9'' {{IPA|[il.lam\u0251\u0303.\u0292e]}} ('He ate it')\n*''Il a mang\u00e9'' {{IPA|[il.am\u0251\u0303.\u0292e]}} ('He ate')\nGemination is obligatory in such contexts.\n\nFinally, a word pronounced with [[#Emphatic stress|emphatic stress]] can exhibit gemination of its first syllable-initial consonant:\n*'''''for'''midable'' {{IPA|[f\u02d0\u0254\u0281.mi.dabl]}} ('terrific')\n*''\u00e9'''pou'''vantable'' {{IPA|[e.p\u02d0u.v\u0251\u0303.tabl]}} ('horrible')\n\n===Liaison===\n{{Main|Liaison (French)}}\n\nMany words in French can be analyzed as having a \"latent\" final consonant that is pronounced only in certain syntactic contexts when the next word begins with a vowel. For example, the word {{wikt-lang|fr|deux}} {{IPA|/d\u00f8/}} ('two') is pronounced {{IPA|[d\u00f8]}} in isolation or before a consonant-initial word (''deux jours'' {{IPA|/d\u00f8 \u0292u\u0281/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[d\u00f8.\u0292u\u0281]}} 'two days'), but in ''deux ans'' {{IPA|/d\u00f8z\u203f\u0251\u0303/}} (\u2192 {{IPA|[d\u00f8.z\u0251\u0303]}} 'two years'), the linking or liaison consonant {{IPA|/z/}} is pronounced.\n\n==Vowels==\n[[Image:French vowel chart.svg|thumb|right|[[Vowel]]s of Parisian French, from {{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|2013|pp=225\u2013226}}. Many speakers merge {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} with {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} with {{IPA|/\u0251/}}. In the latter case, the outcome is an open central {{IPAblink|\u00e4}} between the two (not shown on the chart).]]\nStandard French contrasts up to 13 oral vowels and up to 4 nasal vowels ([[Standard French|Parisian French]] has 10 oral vowels and 3 nasal vowels). The schwa (in the center of the diagram next to this paragraph) is not necessarily a distinctive sound. Even though it often merges with one of the mid front rounded vowels, its patterning suggests that it is a separate phoneme (see the sub-section [[#Schwa|Schwa]] below).\n\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Oral\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Central vowel|Central]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! {{small|[[Roundedness|unrounded]]}}\n! {{small|[[Roundedness|rounded]]}}\n|- class=\"nounderlines\"\n!

However, non-phonemic lax (near-close) {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|\u026a}}, {{IPAplink|\u028f}}, {{IPAplink|\u028a}}]}} appear in Quebec as allophones of {{IPA|/i, y, u/}} when the vowel is both phonetically short (so not before {{IPA|/v, z, \u0292, \u0281/}}) and in a closed syllable, so that e.g. ''petite'' {{IPA|[p\u0259.t\u0361s\u026at]}} 'small ({{abbr|f.|feminine}})' differs from ''petit'' 'small ({{abbr|m.|masculine}})' {{IPA|[p\u0259.t\u0361si]}} not only in the presence of the final {{IPA|/t/}} but also in the tenseness of the {{IPA|/i/}}.

Generally, [[close-mid vowel]]s ({{IPA|/e, \u00f8, o/}}) are found in open syllables, and [[open-mid vowel]]s ({{IPA|/\u025b, \u0153, \u0254/}}) are found in closed syllables.

For instance, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} are found in closed syllables ending in {{IPA|[z]}}, and only {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is found in closed monosyllables before {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0261]}}.{{sfnp|L\u00e9on|1992|p=?}}\n\nThe phonemic opposition of {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} has been lost in the southern half of France, where these two sounds are found only in complementary distribution. The phonemic oppositions of {{IPA|/\u0254/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} and of {{IPA|/\u0153/}} and {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} in terminal open syllables have been lost in all of France, but not in [[Belgium]], where {{wikt-lang|fr|pot}} and {{wikt-lang|fr|peau}} are still opposed as {{IPA|/p\u0254/}} and {{IPA|/po/}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://research.jyu.fi/phonfr/58.html |title=Phon\u00e9tique et prononciation du fran\u00e7ais pour apprenants finnophones |last1=Kalmbach |first1=Jean-Michel |date=2011 |website= |publisher= |access-date=2 October 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Open vowels===\nThe phonemic contrast between front {{IPA|/a/}} and back {{IPA|/\u0251/}} is sometimes not maintained in Standard French, which leads some researchers to reject the idea of two distinct phonemes.<ref>\"Some phoneticians claim that there are two distinct ''a''s in French, but evidence from speaker to speaker and sometimes within the speech of a single speaker is too contradictory to give empirical support to this claim\".{{Harvcoltxt|Casagrande|1984|p=20}}</ref> However, the distinction is still clearly maintained in other dialects such as [[Quebec French]].<ref>[http://www.ciral.ulaval.ca/phonetique/phono/r30.htm Post\u00e9riorisation du / a /] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706214342/http://www.ciral.ulaval.ca/phonetique/phono/r30.htm |date=2011-07-06 }}</ref>\n\nWhile there is much variation among speakers in France, a number of general tendencies can be observed.

Also, there also is an opposite movement for {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}} for which it becomes more open and unrounds to {{IPA|[\u0251\u0303]}}, resulting in a merger of Standard French {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} in this case.{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=33-34}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=Anita Berit|title=Les voyelles nasales du fran\u00e7ais parisien moderne.

A devoiced vowel may be followed by a sound similar to the [[voiceless palatal fricative]] {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} if unrounded or the [[voiceless bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0278]}} if rounded:\n: ''Merci.'' {{IPA|/m\u025b\u0281si/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[m\u025b\u0281.si\u0325\u00e7]}} ('Thank you.'),\n: ''Allez !'' {{IPA|/ale/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[a.le\u0325\u00e7]}} ('Go!'),{{sfnp|Fagyal|Moisset|1999}}\n: ''C'est tout ! '' {{IPA|/s\u025btu/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[s\u025b.tu\u0325\u0278]}} ('That's all!').\n\nIn Quebec French, close vowels are often devoiced when unstressed and surrounded by voiceless consonants:\n: ''universit\u00e9'' {{IPA|/yniv\u025b\u0281site/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[y.ni.v\u025b\u0281.si\u0325.te]}} ('university').{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=27}}\nThough a more prominent feature of Quebec French, phrase-medial devoicing is also found in European French.{{sfnp|Torreira|Ernestus|2010}}\n\n===Elision===\n{{Main|Elision (French)}}\n\nThe final vowel (usually {{IPA|/\u0259/}}) of a number of monosyllabic [[function word]]s is [[elision|elided]] in syntactic combinations with a following word that begins with a vowel. For example, compare the pronunciation of the unstressed subject pronoun, in ''je dors'' {{IPA|/\u0292\u0259 d\u0254\u0281/}} {{IPA|[\u0292\u0259.d\u0254\u0281]}} ('I am sleeping'), and in ''j'arrive'' {{IPA|/\u0292\u203fa\u0281iv/}} {{IPA|[\u0292a.\u0281iv]}} ('I am arriving').\n\n===Glides and diphthongs===\nThe glides {{IPA|[j]}}, {{IPA|[w]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0265]}} appear in syllable onsets immediately followed by a full vowel. In many cases, they alternate systematically with their vowel counterparts {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[u]}}, and {{IPA|[y]}} such as in the following pairs of verb forms:\n:''nie'' {{IPA|[ni]}}; {{wikt-lang|fr|nier}} {{IPA|[nje]}} ('deny')\n:''loue'' {{IPA|[lu]}}; {{wikt-lang|fr|louer}} {{IPA|[lwe]}} ('rent')\n:''tue'' {{IPA|[ty]}}; {{wikt-lang|fr|tuer}} {{IPA|[t\u0265e]}} ('kill')\nThe glides in the examples can be analysed as the result of a glide formation process that turns an underlying high vowel into a glide when followed by another vowel: {{IPA|/nie/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[nje]}}.\n\nThis process is usually blocked after a complex onset of the form obstruent + liquid (a stop or a fricative followed by {{IPA|/l/}} or {{IPA|/\u0281/}}). For example, while the pair ''loue''/''louer'' shows an alternation between {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[w]}}, the same suffix added to ''cloue'' {{IPA|[klu]}}, a word with a complex onset, does not trigger the glide formation: ''clouer'' {{IPA|[klue]}} ('to nail'). Some sequences of glide + vowel can be found after obstruent-liquid onsets, however. The main examples are {{IPA|[\u0265i]}}, as in ''pluie'' {{IPA|[pl\u0265i]}} ('rain'), {{IPA|[wa]}}, and {{IPA|[w\u025b\u0303]}}.<ref>The latter two correspond to orthographic {{angbr|oi}}, as in ''trois'' {{IPA|[t\u0281w\u0251]}} ('three'), which contrasts with disyllabic ''troua'' {{IPA|[t\u0281u.a]}} ('[he] punctured').</ref> They can be dealt with in different ways, as by adding appropriate contextual conditions to the glide formation rule or by assuming that the phonemic inventory of French includes underlying glides or rising [[diphthong]]s like {{IPA|/\u0265i/}} and {{IPA|/wa/}}.{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|pp=37\u201339}}{{sfnp|Chitoran|2002|p=206}}\n\nGlide formation normally does not occur across morpheme boundaries in compounds like ''semi-aride'' ('semi-arid').{{sfnp|Chitoran|Hualde|2007|p=45}} However, in colloquial registers, ''si elle'' {{IPA|[si.\u025bl]}} ('if she') can be pronounced just like {{wikt-lang|fr|ciel}} {{IPA|[sj\u025bl]}} ('sky'), or ''tu as'' {{IPA|[ty.\u0251]}} ('you have') like ''tua'' {{IPA|[t\u0265a]}} ('[he] killed').{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=39}}\n\nThe glide {{IPA|[j]}} can also occur in syllable coda position, after a vowel, as in {{wikt-lang|fr|soleil}} {{IPA|[s\u0254l\u025bj]}} ('sun'). There again, one can formulate a derivation from an underlying full vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, but the analysis is not always adequate because of the existence of possible minimal pairs like {{wikt-lang|fr|pays}} {{IPA|[p\u025b.i]}} ('country') / {{wikt-lang|fr|paye}} {{IPA|[p\u025bj]}} ('paycheck') and {{wikt-lang|fr|abbaye}} {{IPA|[a.b\u025b.i]}} ('abbey') / {{wikt-lang|fr|abeille}} {{IPA|[a.b\u025bj]}} ('bee').<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=39}}. The words ''pays'' and ''abbaye'' are more frequently pronounced {{IPA|[pe.i]}} and {{IPA|[abe.i]}}.</ref> Schane (1968) proposes an abstract analysis deriving postvocalic {{IPA|[j]}} from an underlying lateral by palatalization and glide conversion ({{IPA|/lj/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/\u028e/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/j/}}).{{sfnp|Schane|1968|pp=57\u201360}}\n\n{| style=\"padding:10px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"padding:10px\" | Vowel\n! colspan=3 style=\"padding:10px\" | Onset glide\n! rowspan=2 style=\"padding:10px\" | Examples\n|-\n! style=\"padding:10px\" | /j/\n! style=\"padding:10px\" | /\u0265/\n! style=\"padding:10px\" | /w/\n|-\n| {{IPA|/a/}}\n| {{IPA|/ja/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265a/}}\n| {{IPA|/wa/}}\n| pa<u>illa</u>sse, \u00c9l<u>ua</u>rd, p<u>oi</u>re\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0251/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u0251/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u0251/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u0251/}}\n| acar<u>i\u00e2</u>tre, t<u>u\u00e2</u>mes, j<u>ou\u00e2</u>mes\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0251\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u0251\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u0251\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u0251\u0303/}}\n| va<u>illant</u>, ext\u00e9n<u>uant</u>, Ass<u>ouan</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/e/}}\n| {{IPA|/je/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265e/}}\n| {{IPA|/we/}}\n| janv<u>ier</u>, m<u>uer</u>, j<u>ou</u>er\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u025b/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u025b/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u025b/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u025b/}}\n| l<u>ie</u>rre, d<u>ue</u>l, m<u>oue</u>tte\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u025b\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u025b\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u025b\u0303/}}\n| b<u>ien</u>, j<u>uin</u>, s<u>oin</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/i/}}\n| {{IPA|/ji/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265i/}}\n| {{IPA|/wi/}}\n| <u>yi</u>n, h<u>ui</u>le, <u>ou\u00ef</u>r\n|-\n| {{IPA|/o/}}\n| {{IPA|/jo/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265o/}}\n| {{IPA|/wo/}}\n| M<u>illau</u>, d<u>uo</u>, statuq<u>uo</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0254/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u0254/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u0254/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u0254/}}\n| N<u>io</u>rt, quat<u>uo</u>r, <u>wo</u>k\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u0254\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u0254\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u0254\u0303/}}\n| l<u>ion</u>, t<u>uons</u>, j<u>ouons</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u00f8/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u00f8/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u00f8/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u00f8/}}\n| m<u>ieux</u>, fruct<u>ueux</u>, b<u>oueux</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0153/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u0153/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u0153/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u0153/}}\n| ant\u00e9r<u>ieu</u>r, s<u>ueu</u>r, l<u>oueu</u>r\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}}\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|-\n| {{IPA|/u/}}\n| {{IPA|/ju/}}\n| \n| \n| ca<u>illou</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/y/}}\n| {{IPA|/jy/}}\n| \n| \n| feu<u>illu</u>\n|}\n\n==Stress==\nWord stress is not distinctive in French, so two words cannot be distinguished on the basis of stress placement alone. In fact, grammatical stress is always on the final full syllable (syllable with a vowel other than schwa) of a word. Monosyllables with schwa as their only vowel ({{wikt-lang|fr|ce}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|de}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|que}}, etc.) are generally [[clitic]]s but otherwise may receive stress.{{sfnp|Anderson|1982|p=537}}\n\nThe difference between stressed and unstressed syllables in French is less marked than in English. Vowels in unstressed syllables keep their full quality, regardless of whether the rhythm of the speaker is syllable-timed or mora-timed (see [[isochrony]]).<ref>Mora-timed speech is frequent in French, especially in Canada, where it is very much the norm.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}</ref> Moreover, words lose their stress to varying degrees when pronounced in phrases and sentences. In general, only the last word in a phonological phrase retains its full grammatical stress (on its last full syllable).{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=194\u2013200}}\n\n===Emphatic stress===\nEmphatic stress is used to call attention to a specific element in a given context such as to express a contrast or to reinforce the emotive content of a word. In French, this stress falls on the first consonant-initial syllable of the word in question. The characteristics associated with emphatic stress include increased amplitude and pitch of the vowel and gemination of the onset consonant, as mentioned [[#Geminates|above]].{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=200\u2013201}} Emphatic stress does not replace, but occurs in tandem with, grammatical stress.{{sfnp|Walker|2001|pp=181\u20142}}\n*''C'est parfaitement vrai''. {{IPA|[s\u025b.pa\u0281.f\u025bt.m\u0251\u0303.\u02c8v\u0281\u025b]}} ('It's perfectly true.'; no emphatic stress)\n*''C'est '''par'''faitement vrai.''

syllable that begins with a consonant or on the initial syllable with the insertion of a glottal stop or a [[liaison (French)|liaison]] consonant.\n*''C'est \u00e9'''pouv'''antable.''

substantially from that of English.{{sfnp|Lian|1980}} There are four primary patterns:\n\n*The continuation pattern is a rise in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a rhythm group (typically a phrase).\n*The finality pattern is a sharp fall in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a declarative statement.\n*The yes/no intonation is a sharp rise in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a yes/no question.\n*The information question intonation is a rapid fall-off from high pitch on the first word of a non-yes/no question, often followed by a small rise in pitch on the last syllable of the question.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[History of French]]\n*[[Phonological history of French]]\n*[[Varieties of French]]\n*[[French orthography]]\n*[[Reforms of French orthography]]\n*[[Phonologie du

The following cases can be identified.{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nThe geminate pronunciation {{IPA|[\u0281\u0281]}} is found in the future and conditional forms of the verbs {{wikt-lang|fr|courir}} ('to run') and {{wikt-lang|fr|mourir}} ('to die'). The conditional form ''il mourrait'' {{IPA|[il.mu\u0281.\u0281\u025b]}} ('he would die'), for example, contrasts with the imperfect form ''il mourait'' {{IPA|[il.mu.\u0281\u025b]}} ('he was dying'). In some other words, most modern speakers have reduced {{IPA|[\u0281\u0281]}} to {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, such as \"il pourrait\" ('he could'). Other verbs that have a double {{angbr|rr}} orthographically in the future and conditional are pronounced with a simple {{IPA|[\u0281]}}: ''il pourra'' ('he will be able to'), ''il verra'' ('he will see').\n\nWhen the prefix {{wikt-lang|fr|in-}} combines with a base that begins with ''n'', the resulting word is sometimes pronounced with a geminate {{IPA|[nn]}} and similarly for the variants of the same prefix ''im-'', ''il-'', ''ir-'': \n* {{wikt-lang|fr|inn\u00e9}} {{IPA|[i(n).ne]}} ('innate')\n* {{wikt-lang|fr|immortel}} {{IPA|[i(m).m\u0254\u0281t\u025bl]}} ('immortal')\n* {{wikt-lang|fr|illisible}} {{IPA|[i(l).li.zibl]}} ('illegible')\n* {{wikt-lang|fr|irresponsable}} {{IPA|[i(\u0281).\u0281\u025bs.p\u0254\u0303.sabl]}} ('irresponsible')\n\nOther cases of optional gemination can be found in words like {{wikt-lang|fr|syllabe}} ('syllable'), {{wikt-lang|fr|grammaire}} ('grammar'), and {{wikt-lang|fr|illusion}} ('illusion'). The pronunciation of such words, in many cases, a [[spelling pronunciation]] varies by speaker and gives rise to widely varying stylistic effects.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Yaguello|1991}}, cited in {{harvcoltxt|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=51}}.</ref> In particular, the gemination of consonants other than the liquids and nasals {{IPA|/m n l \u0281/}} is \"generally considered affected or pedantic\".{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|p=150}} Examples of stylistically marked pronunciations include {{wikt-lang|fr|addition}} {{IPA|[ad.di.sj\u0254\u0303]}} ('addition') and {{wikt-lang|fr|intelligence}} {{IPA|[\u025b\u0303.t\u025bl.li.\u0292\u0251\u0303s]}} ('intelligence').\n\nGemination of doubled {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}} is typical of the [[Languedoc]] region, as opposed to other southern accents.\n\nA few cases of gemination do not correspond to double consonant letters in the orthography.{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=151\u2013153}} The deletion of word-internal schwas (see below), for example, can give rise to sequences of identical consonants: ''l\u00e0-dedans'' {{IPA|[lad.d\u0251\u0303]}} ('inside'), ''l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9''  {{IPA|[l\u0254.n\u025bt.te]}} ('honesty'). The elided form of the object pronoun ''l<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' ('him/her/it') is also realised as a geminate {{IPA|[ll]}} when it appears after another ''l'' to avoid misunderstanding:\n*''Il l'a mang\u00e9'' {{IPA|[il.lam\u0251\u0303.\u0292e]}} ('He ate it')\n*''Il a mang\u00e9'' {{IPA|[il.am\u0251\u0303.\u0292e]}} ('He ate')\nGemination is obligatory in such contexts.\n\nFinally, a word pronounced with [[#Emphatic stress|emphatic stress]] can exhibit gemination of its first syllable-initial consonant:\n*'''''for'''midable'' {{IPA|[f\u02d0\u0254\u0281.mi.dabl]}} ('terrific')\n*''\u00e9'''pou'''vantable'' {{IPA|[e.p\u02d0u.v\u0251\u0303.tabl]}} ('horrible')\n\n===Liaison===\n{{Main|Liaison (French)}}\n\nMany words in French can be analyzed as having a \"latent\" final consonant that is pronounced only in certain syntactic contexts when the next word begins with a vowel. For example, the word {{wikt-lang|fr|deux}} {{IPA|/d\u00f8/}} ('two') is pronounced {{IPA|[d\u00f8]}} in isolation or before a consonant-initial word (''deux jours'' {{IPA|/d\u00f8 \u0292u\u0281/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[d\u00f8.\u0292u\u0281]}} 'two days'), but in ''deux ans'' {{IPA|/d\u00f8z\u203f\u0251\u0303/}} (\u2192 {{IPA|[d\u00f8.z\u0251\u0303]}} 'two years'), the linking or liaison consonant {{IPA|/z/}} is pronounced.\n\n==Vowels==\n[[Image:French vowel chart.svg|thumb|right|[[Vowel]]s of Parisian French, from {{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|2013|pp=225\u2013226}}. Many speakers merge {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} with {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} with {{IPA|/\u0251/}}. In the latter case, the outcome is an open central {{IPAblink|\u00e4}} between the two (not shown on the chart).]]\nStandard French contrasts up to 13 oral vowels and up to 4 nasal vowels ([[Standard French|Parisian French]] has 10 oral vowels and 3 nasal vowels). The schwa (in the center of the diagram next to this paragraph) is not necessarily a distinctive sound. Even though it often merges with one of the mid front rounded vowels, its patterning suggests that it is a separate phoneme (see the sub-section [[#Schwa|Schwa]] below).\n\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Oral\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Central vowel|Central]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! {{small|[[Roundedness|unrounded]]}}\n! {{small|[[Roundedness|rounded]]}}\n|- class=\"nounderlines\"\n!

However, non-phonemic lax (near-close) {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|\u026a}}, {{IPAplink|\u028f}}, {{IPAplink|\u028a}}]}} appear in Quebec as allophones of {{IPA|/i, y, u/}} when the vowel is both phonetically short (so not before {{IPA|/v, z, \u0292, \u0281/}}) and in a closed syllable, so that e.g. ''petite'' {{IPA|[p\u0259.t\u0361s\u026at]}} 'small ({{abbr|f.|feminine}})' differs from ''petit'' 'small ({{abbr|m.|masculine}})' {{IPA|[p\u0259.t\u0361si]}} not only in the presence of the final {{IPA|/t/}} but also in the tenseness of the {{IPA|/i/}}. Laxing always occurs in stressed closed syllables, but it is also found in other environments to various degrees.{{sfnp|Walker|1984|pp=51\u201360}}{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|pp=25\u20136}}\n\nIn Parisian French, {{IPA|/i, u/}} are consistently close {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|i}}, {{IPAplink|u}}]}},{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=73}}{{sfnp|Lodge|2009|p=84}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2013|p=225}} but the exact height of {{IPA|/y/}} is somewhat debatable as it has been variously described as close {{IPAblink|y}}{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=73}}{{sfnp|Lodge|2009|p=84}} and near-close {{IPAblink|\u028f}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2013|p=225}}\n\n===Mid vowels===\nAlthough the mid vowels contrast in certain environments, there is limited distributional overlap so they often appear in complementary distribution. Generally, [[close-mid vowel]]s ({{IPA|/e, \u00f8, o/}}) are found in open syllables, and [[open-mid vowel]]s ({{IPA|/\u025b, \u0153, \u0254/}}) are found in closed syllables. However, there are minimal pairs:{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=73}}\n* open-mid {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and close-mid {{IPA|/e/}} contrast in final-position open syllables:\n*: {{wikt-lang|fr|allait}} {{IPA|[a.l\u025b]}} ('was going'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|all\u00e9}}  {{IPA|[a.le]}} ('gone');\n* likewise, open-mid {{IPA|/\u0254/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153/}} contrast with close-mid {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} mostly in closed monosyllables, such as these:\n*: {{wikt-lang|fr|jeune}} {{IPA|[\u0292\u0153n]}} ('young'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|je\u00fbne}} {{IPA|[\u0292\u00f8n]}} ('fast', verb),\n*: {{wikt-lang|fr|roc}} {{IPA|[\u0281\u0254k]}} ('rock'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|rauque}} {{IPA|[\u0281ok]}} ('hoarse'),\n*: {{wikt-lang|fr|Rhodes}} {{IPA|[\u0281\u0254d]}} ('Rhodes'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|r\u00f4de}} {{IPA|[\u0281od]}} ('[I] lurk'),\n*: {{wikt-lang|fr|Paul}} {{IPA|[p\u0254l]}} ('Paul', masculine), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|Paule}} {{IPA|[pol]}} ('Paule', feminine),\n*: {{wikt-lang|fr|bonne}} {{IPA|[b\u0254n]}} ('good', feminine), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|Beaune}} {{IPA|[bon]}} ('[[Beaune]]', the city).\n\nBeyond the general rule, known as the ''loi de position'' among French phonologists,{{sfnp|Morin|1986}} there are some exceptions. For instance, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} are found in closed syllables ending in {{IPA|[z]}}, and only {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is found in closed monosyllables before {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0261]}}.{{sfnp|L\u00e9on|1992|p=?}}\n\nThe phonemic opposition of {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} has been lost in the southern half of France, where these two sounds are found only in complementary distribution. The phonemic oppositions of {{IPA|/\u0254/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} and of {{IPA|/\u0153/}} and {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} in terminal open syllables have been lost in all of France, but not in [[Belgium]], where {{wikt-lang|fr|pot}} and {{wikt-lang|fr|peau}} are still opposed as {{IPA|/p\u0254/}} and {{IPA|/po/}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://research.jyu.fi/phonfr/58.html |title=Phon\u00e9tique et prononciation du fran\u00e7ais pour apprenants finnophones |last1=Kalmbach |first1=Jean-Michel |date=2011 |website= |publisher= |access-date=2 October 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Open vowels===\nThe phonemic contrast between front {{IPA|/a/}} and back {{IPA|/\u0251/}} is sometimes not maintained in Standard French, which leads some researchers to reject the idea of two distinct phonemes.<ref>\"Some phoneticians claim that there are two distinct ''a''s in French, but evidence from speaker to speaker and sometimes within the speech of a single speaker is too contradictory to give empirical support to this claim\".{{Harvcoltxt|Casagrande|1984|p=20}}</ref> However, the distinction is still clearly maintained in other dialects such as [[Quebec French]].<ref>[http://www.ciral.ulaval.ca/phonetique/phono/r30.htm Post\u00e9riorisation du / a /] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706214342/http://www.ciral.ulaval.ca/phonetique/phono/r30.htm |date=2011-07-06 }}</ref>\n\nWhile there is much variation among speakers in France, a number of general tendencies can be observed. First of all, the distinction is most often preserved in word-final stressed syllables such as in these minimal pairs:\n: {{wikt-lang|fr|tache}} {{IPA|/ta\u0283/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[ta\u0283]}} ('stain'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|t\u00e2che}} {{IPA|/t\u0251\u0283/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[t\u0251\u0283]}} ('task')\n: {{wikt-lang|fr|patte}} {{IPA|/pat/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[pat]}} ('leg'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|p\u00e2te}} {{IPA|/p\u0251t/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[p\u0251t]}} ('paste, pastry')\n: {{wikt-lang|fr|rat}} {{IPA|/\u0281a/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0281a]}} ('rat'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|ras}} {{IPA|/\u0281\u0251/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0281\u0251]}} ('short')\n\nThere are certain environments that prefer one open vowel over the other. For example, {{IPA|/\u0251/}} is preferred after {{IPA|/\u0281w/}} and before {{IPA|/z/}}:\n: {{wikt-lang|fr|trois}} {{IPA|[t\u0281w\u0251]}} ('three'),\n: {{wikt-lang|fr|gaz}} {{IPA|[\u0261\u0251z]}} ('gas').{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|p=64}}\n\nThe difference in quality is often reinforced by a difference in length (but the difference is contrastive in final closed syllables). The exact distribution of the two vowels varies greatly from speaker to speaker.<ref>\"For example, some have the front {{IPA|[a]}} in {{wikt-lang|fr|casse}} 'breaks', and the back {{IPA|[\u0251]}} in {{wikt-lang|fr|tasse}} 'cup', but for others the reverse is true. There are also, of course, those who use the same vowel, either {{IPA|[a]}} or {{IPA|[\u0251]}}, in both words\".{{Harvcoltxt|Tranel|1987|p=48}}</ref>\n\nBack {{IPA|/\u0251/}} is much rarer in unstressed syllables, but it can be encountered in some common words:\n: {{wikt-lang|fr|ch\u00e2teau}} {{IPA|[\u0283\u0251.to]}} ('castle'),\n: {{wikt-lang|fr|pass\u00e9}} {{IPA|[p\u0251.se]}} ('past').\n\nMorphologically complex words derived from words containing stressed {{IPA|/\u0251/}} do not retain it:\n: {{wikt-lang|fr|\u00e2g\u00e9}} {{IPA|/\u0251\u0292e/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[a\u02d0.\u0292e]}} ('aged', from {{wikt-lang|fr|\u00e2ge}} {{IPA|/\u0251\u0292/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0251\u0292]}})\n: ''rarissime'' {{IPA|/\u0281a\u0281isim/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0281a\u0281isim]}} ('very rare', from {{wikt-lang|fr|rare}} {{IPA|/\u0281\u0251\u0281/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0281\u0251\u0281]}}).\n\nEven in the final syllable of a word, back {{IPA|/\u0251/}} may become {{IPA|[a]}} if the word in question loses its stress within the extended phonological context:{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|p=64}}\n: ''J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 au '''bois''''' {{IPA|/\u0292e ete o bw\u0251/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0292e.e.te.o.bw\u0251]}} ('I went to the woods'),\n: ''J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 au '''bois''' de Vincennes'' {{IPA|/\u0292e ete o bw\u0251 d\u0259v\u025b\u0303s\u025bn/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0292e.e.te.o.bwad.v\u025b\u0303.s\u025bn]}} ('I went to the Vincennes woods').\n\n===Nasal vowels===\nThe phonetic qualities of the back nasal vowels are not very similar to those of the corresponding oral vowels, and the contrasting factor that distinguishes {{IPA|/\u0251\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}} is the extra lip rounding of the latter according to some linguists,{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=74}} but other linguists have come to the conclusion that the main difference is in tongue height.{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=33-34}} Speakers who produce both {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} distinguish them mainly through increased lip rounding of the former, but many speakers use only the latter phoneme, especially most speakers in northern France such as Paris (but not farther north, in [[Belgium]]).{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=74}}{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=33-34}}\n\nIn some dialects, particularly that of Europe, there is an attested tendency for nasal vowels to shift in a counterclockwise direction: {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} tends to be more open and shifts toward the vowel space of {{IPA|/\u0251\u0303/}} (realised also as {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0303]}}), {{IPA|/\u0251\u0303/}} rises and rounds to {{IPA|[\u0254\u0303]}} (realised also as {{IPA|[\u0252\u0303]}}) and {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}} shifts to {{IPA|[\u00f5]}} or {{IPA|[\u0169]}}.

It is pronounced before a following consonant-initial word.{{sfnp|Casagrande|1984|pp=228\u201329}} For example, ''une grande femme fut ici ''{{IPA|[yn \u0261\u0281\u0251\u0303d fam fy.t\u203fi.si]}}, would be pronounced {{IPA|[y.n\u0259 \u0261\u0281\u0251\u0303.d\u0259 fa.m\u0259 fy.t\u203fi.si]}}, with the {{IPA|/\u0259/}} at the end of each word being pronounced.\n\nSchwa cannot normally be realised as a front vowel ({{IPAblink|\u0153}}) in closed syllables.

A devoiced vowel may be followed by a sound similar to the [[voiceless palatal fricative]] {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} if unrounded or the [[voiceless bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0278]}} if rounded:\n: ''Merci.'' {{IPA|/m\u025b\u0281si/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[m\u025b\u0281.si\u0325\u00e7]}} ('Thank you.'),\n: ''Allez !'' {{IPA|/ale/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[a.le\u0325\u00e7]}} ('Go!'),{{sfnp|Fagyal|Moisset|1999}}\n: ''C'est tout ! '' {{IPA|/s\u025btu/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[s\u025b.tu\u0325\u0278]}} ('That's all!').\n\nIn Quebec French, close vowels are often devoiced when unstressed and surrounded by voiceless consonants:\n: ''universit\u00e9'' {{IPA|/yniv\u025b\u0281site/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[y.ni.v\u025b\u0281.si\u0325.te]}} ('university').{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=27}}\nThough a more prominent feature of Quebec French, phrase-medial devoicing is also found in European French.{{sfnp|Torreira|Ernestus|2010}}\n\n===Elision===\n{{Main|Elision (French)}}\n\nThe final vowel (usually {{IPA|/\u0259/}}) of a number of monosyllabic [[function word]]s is [[elision|elided]] in syntactic combinations with a following word that begins with a vowel. For example, compare the pronunciation of the unstressed subject pronoun, in ''je dors'' {{IPA|/\u0292\u0259 d\u0254\u0281/}} {{IPA|[\u0292\u0259.d\u0254\u0281]}} ('I am sleeping'), and in ''j'arrive'' {{IPA|/\u0292\u203fa\u0281iv/}} {{IPA|[\u0292a.\u0281iv]}} ('I am arriving').\n\n===Glides and diphthongs===\nThe glides {{IPA|[j]}}, {{IPA|[w]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0265]}} appear in syllable onsets immediately followed by a full vowel. In many cases, they alternate systematically with their vowel counterparts {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[u]}}, and {{IPA|[y]}} such as in the following pairs of verb forms:\n:''nie'' {{IPA|[ni]}}; {{wikt-lang|fr|nier}} {{IPA|[nje]}} ('deny')\n:''loue'' {{IPA|[lu]}}; {{wikt-lang|fr|louer}} {{IPA|[lwe]}} ('rent')\n:''tue'' {{IPA|[ty]}}; {{wikt-lang|fr|tuer}} {{IPA|[t\u0265e]}} ('kill')\nThe glides in the examples can be analysed as the result of a glide formation process that turns an underlying high vowel into a glide when followed by another vowel: {{IPA|/nie/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[nje]}}.\n\nThis process is usually blocked after a complex onset of the form obstruent + liquid (a stop or a fricative followed by {{IPA|/l/}} or {{IPA|/\u0281/}}). For example, while the pair ''loue''/''louer'' shows an alternation between {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[w]}}, the same suffix added to ''cloue'' {{IPA|[klu]}}, a word with a complex onset, does not trigger the glide formation: ''clouer'' {{IPA|[klue]}} ('to nail'). Some sequences of glide + vowel can be found after obstruent-liquid onsets, however. The main examples are {{IPA|[\u0265i]}}, as in ''pluie'' {{IPA|[pl\u0265i]}} ('rain'), {{IPA|[wa]}}, and {{IPA|[w\u025b\u0303]}}.<ref>The latter two correspond to orthographic {{angbr|oi}}, as in ''trois'' {{IPA|[t\u0281w\u0251]}} ('three'), which contrasts with disyllabic ''troua'' {{IPA|[t\u0281u.a]}} ('[he] punctured').</ref> They can be dealt with in different ways, as by adding appropriate contextual conditions to the glide formation rule or by assuming that the phonemic inventory of French includes underlying glides or rising [[diphthong]]s like {{IPA|/\u0265i/}} and {{IPA|/wa/}}.{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|pp=37\u201339}}{{sfnp|Chitoran|2002|p=206}}\n\nGlide formation normally does not occur across morpheme boundaries in compounds like ''semi-aride'' ('semi-arid').{{sfnp|Chitoran|Hualde|2007|p=45}} However, in colloquial registers, ''si elle'' {{IPA|[si.\u025bl]}} ('if she') can be pronounced just like {{wikt-lang|fr|ciel}} {{IPA|[sj\u025bl]}} ('sky'), or ''tu as'' {{IPA|[ty.\u0251]}} ('you have') like ''tua'' {{IPA|[t\u0265a]}} ('[he] killed').{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=39}}\n\nThe glide {{IPA|[j]}} can also occur in syllable coda position, after a vowel, as in {{wikt-lang|fr|soleil}} {{IPA|[s\u0254l\u025bj]}} ('sun'). There again, one can formulate a derivation from an underlying full vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, but the analysis is not always adequate because of the existence of possible minimal pairs like {{wikt-lang|fr|pays}} {{IPA|[p\u025b.i]}} ('country') / {{wikt-lang|fr|paye}} {{IPA|[p\u025bj]}} ('paycheck') and {{wikt-lang|fr|abbaye}} {{IPA|[a.b\u025b.i]}} ('abbey') / {{wikt-lang|fr|abeille}} {{IPA|[a.b\u025bj]}} ('bee').<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=39}}. The words ''pays'' and ''abbaye'' are more frequently pronounced {{IPA|[pe.i]}} and {{IPA|[abe.i]}}.</ref> Schane (1968) proposes an abstract analysis deriving postvocalic {{IPA|[j]}} from an underlying lateral by palatalization and glide conversion ({{IPA|/lj/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/\u028e/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/j/}}).{{sfnp|Schane|1968|pp=57\u201360}}\n\n{| style=\"padding:10px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"padding:10px\" | Vowel\n! colspan=3 style=\"padding:10px\" | Onset glide\n! rowspan=2 style=\"padding:10px\" | Examples\n|-\n! style=\"padding:10px\" | /j/\n! style=\"padding:10px\" | /\u0265/\n! style=\"padding:10px\" | /w/\n|-\n| {{IPA|/a/}}\n| {{IPA|/ja/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265a/}}\n| {{IPA|/wa/}}\n| pa<u>illa</u>sse, \u00c9l<u>ua</u>rd, p<u>oi</u>re\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0251/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u0251/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u0251/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u0251/}}\n| acar<u>i\u00e2</u>tre, t<u>u\u00e2</u>mes, j<u>ou\u00e2</u>mes\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0251\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u0251\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u0251\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u0251\u0303/}}\n| va<u>illant</u>, ext\u00e9n<u>uant</u>, Ass<u>ouan</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/e/}}\n| {{IPA|/je/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265e/}}\n| {{IPA|/we/}}\n| janv<u>ier</u>, m<u>uer</u>, j<u>ou</u>er\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u025b/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u025b/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u025b/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u025b/}}\n| l<u>ie</u>rre, d<u>ue</u>l, m<u>oue</u>tte\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u025b\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u025b\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u025b\u0303/}}\n| b<u>ien</u>, j<u>uin</u>, s<u>oin</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/i/}}\n| {{IPA|/ji/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265i/}}\n| {{IPA|/wi/}}\n| <u>yi</u>n, h<u>ui</u>le, <u>ou\u00ef</u>r\n|-\n| {{IPA|/o/}}\n| {{IPA|/jo/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265o/}}\n| {{IPA|/wo/}}\n| M<u>illau</u>, d<u>uo</u>, statuq<u>uo</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0254/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u0254/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u0254/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u0254/}}\n| N<u>io</u>rt, quat<u>uo</u>r, <u>wo</u>k\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u0254\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u0254\u0303/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u0254\u0303/}}\n| l<u>ion</u>, t<u>uons</u>, j<u>ouons</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u00f8/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u00f8/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u00f8/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u00f8/}}\n| m<u>ieux</u>, fruct<u>ueux</u>, b<u>oueux</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0153/}}\n| {{IPA|/j\u0153/}}\n| {{IPA|/\u0265\u0153/}}\n| {{IPA|/w\u0153/}}\n| ant\u00e9r<u>ieu</u>r, s<u>ueu</u>r, l<u>oueu</u>r\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}}\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|-\n| {{IPA|/u/}}\n| {{IPA|/ju/}}\n| \n| \n| ca<u>illou</u>\n|-\n| {{IPA|/y/}}\n| {{IPA|/jy/}}\n| \n| \n| feu<u>illu</u>\n|}\n\n==Stress==\nWord stress is not distinctive in French, so two words cannot be distinguished on the basis of stress placement alone. In fact, grammatical stress is always on the final full syllable (syllable with a vowel other than schwa) of a word. Monosyllables with schwa as their only vowel ({{wikt-lang|fr|ce}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|de}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|que}}, etc.) are generally [[clitic]]s but otherwise may receive stress.{{sfnp|Anderson|1982|p=537}}\n\nThe difference between stressed and unstressed syllables in French is less marked than in English. Vowels in unstressed syllables keep their full quality, regardless of whether the rhythm of the speaker is syllable-timed or mora-timed (see [[isochrony]]).<ref>Mora-timed speech is frequent in French, especially in Canada, where it is very much the norm.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}</ref> Moreover, words lose their stress to varying degrees when pronounced in phrases and sentences. In general, only the last word in a phonological phrase retains its full grammatical stress (on its last full syllable).{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=194\u2013200}}\n\n===Emphatic stress===\nEmphatic stress is used to call attention to a specific element in a given context such as to express a contrast or to reinforce the emotive content of a word. In French, this stress falls on the first consonant-initial syllable of the word in question. The characteristics associated with emphatic stress include increased amplitude and pitch of the vowel and gemination of the onset consonant, as mentioned [[#Geminates|above]].{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=200\u2013201}} Emphatic stress does not replace, but occurs in tandem with, grammatical stress.{{sfnp|Walker|2001|pp=181\u20142}}\n*''C'est parfaitement vrai''. {{IPA|[s\u025b.pa\u0281.f\u025bt.m\u0251\u0303.\u02c8v\u0281\u025b]}} ('It's perfectly true.'; no emphatic stress)\n*''C'est '''par'''faitement vrai.'' {{IPA|[s\u025b.\u02c8p(\u02d0)a\u0281.f\u025bt.m\u0251\u0303.\u02c8v\u0281\u025b]}} (emphatic stress on ''parfaitement'')\n\nFor words that begin with a vowel, emphatic stress falls on the first syllable that begins with a consonant or on the initial syllable with the insertion of a glottal stop or a [[liaison (French)|liaison]] consonant.\n*''C'est \u00e9'''pouv'''antable.'' {{IPA|[s\u025b.te.\u02c8p(\u02d0)u.v\u0251\u0303\u02c8.tabl]}} ('It's terrible.'; emphatic stress on second syllable of ''\u00e9pouvantable'')\n*''C'est '''\u00e9'''pouvantable !'' {{IPA|[s\u025b.\u02c8t(\u02d0)e.pu.v\u0251\u0303.\u02c8tabl]}} (initial syllable with liaison consonant {{IPA|[t]}})\n*''C'est '''\u00e9'''pouvantable !'' {{IPA|[s\u025b.\u02c8\u0294e.pu.v\u0251\u0303.\u02c8tabl]}} (initial syllable with glottal stop insertion)\n\n==Intonation==\n\n{{Main|Intonation (linguistics)#French}}\n\nFrench intonation differs substantially from that of English.{{sfnp|Lian|1980}} There are four primary patterns:\n\n*The continuation pattern is a rise in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a rhythm group (typically a phrase).\n*The finality pattern is a sharp fall in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a declarative statement.\n*The yes/no intonation is a sharp rise in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a yes/no question.\n*The information question intonation is a rapid fall-off from high pitch on the first word of a non-yes/no question, often followed by a small rise in pitch on the last syllable of the question.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[History of French]]\n*[[Phonological history of French]]\n*[[Varieties of French]]\n*[[French orthography]]\n*[[Reforms of French orthography]]\n*[[Phonologie du

She competed at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] and the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], winning a bronze medal at the former.<ref name=\"SportsRef\">{{cite Sports-Reference |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/sm/pat-smythe-1.html |title=Pat Smythe Olympic Results |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref> She also wrote many books on equestrian themes, largely for children.\n\n==Early years==\nPat Smythe was the last of three children, the other two being Dicky and Ronald Smythe. Dicky died from [[pneumonia]] at the age of 4.  Her parents were [[Eric Hamilton Smythe]] and [[Frances Monica Curtoys]], who were born in the early 1900s.  She lived in London, on the outskirts of [[Richmond Park]].  Later she was a boarder at [[Talbot Heath School]] in [[Bournemouth]].\n\nPat nearly died when she was nearly 5 from [[diphtheria]].  Although she recovered fully, it meant that she had to learn to walk again. Hardship and suffering were to feature predominantly throughout her professional and personal life. Her father died when she was in her late teens, and her mother when she was 23.\n\n==War years==\nWorld War II brought times of separation for the family. In early 1940 her father was sent to Biskra in Algeria in search of a respite from his arthritis. Her mother remained in London working for the [[Red Cross]].\n\nDuring her father's return from North Africa via France, her mother set out to find him. She eventually found him in the town of [[Aix-les-Bains]]. Together they managed to get out of France, under enemy fire, on the very last boat leaving Bordeaux just before the Germans occupied the city and the majority of the rest of France.\n\nPat herself was sent to the [[Cotswolds]] (Ferne) for her safety, along with her pony, Pixie. Her brother had been [[Emergency evacuation|evacuated]] to [[Newquay]] in Cornwall, where his school had relocated.\n\nIt was during that time, whilst getting into an entanglement with several horses, that Pat met the King in the middle of the road. Unaware of who he was, she said to the driver of the car he was travelling in ''Shut up! Can't you see I'm trying to get these horses out of the road!''\n\nIn early 1941, Pat and her parents relocated to a house in the Cotswolds.  Her parents still had to work hard, and things were never easy. The house had to serve as a [[guest house (lodging)|guesthouse]], as well as a family home.\n\nIn 1949, after her father's death, Pat and her mother moved again, to [[Miserden]] in the Cotswolds.\n\n==Ponies and horses==\nSmythe's first ride was on a small pony known as Bubbles.  Although he was her brother's pony, she learned to ride on him but outgrew him eventually.  After that, her parents bought her a Dartmoor/Arab-cross pony named Pixie.  Pixie was later mated and gave birth to a filly called Vicky.\n\nPat's mother used to be sent [[polo pony|polo ponies]] by a friend of the family, [[Johnny Traill#References|Johnny Traill]], to break and be schooled for [[polo]] playing.  Although they were not hers, when she was older, Pat also helped school and break them.\n\nIt was not until Pat's relocation to the Cotswolds that her first taste of showjumping came with [[Finality (horse)|Finality]]. After varied success at [[gymkhana]]s and numerous injuries which Finality suffered, Pat was able to compete in her first International Show. Eventually she was asked to join the British team with Colonel [[Harry Llewellyn]], [[Ruby Holland-Martin]], [[Toby Robeson]] and [[Brian Butler (showjumper)|Brian Butler]] in 1947.  But the partnership with Finality was not to last. She had been lent to the family by [[Johnny Traill#References|Johnny Traill]] and, due to financial pressure, had to be sold.\n\nPat's next horse, the grey mare Carmena, came after the parting with Finality. Although Carmena was a talented and successful horse, Pat admitted that she could never feel the same closeness she had had with Finality.\n\nShortly after Carmena came another mare, Leona. Leona served Pat well until the death of her mother meant that finances became tight. Being the most valuable horse (at the time), Leona had to be sold.\n\nIn 1949, Pat acquired her cheapest horse, Prince Hal.  Bought as an ex-racehorse, he was initially named Fourtowns. \n\nTosca was Pat's next purchase.  She was born in 1945. It was her most successful partnership after Finality, winning many medals and major showjumping prizes of the day.  Tosca was one of the ones she most often competed abroad.  After Tosca's retirement from showjumping in the mid 1950s, she bred several foals, including Lucia (by Gay Scot, born 1957), Favourita (by Blue Duster, born 1958), Flamenca (by Tambourin, born 1959), Laurella (by Schapiro, born 1960), Prince Igor (by Shapiro born 1961), Chocolate Soldier (her sixth, by either Bitter Sweet or Cortachy, born 1962), Melba (by Pincola, born 1963), Sir John (by Shapiro, born 1964) and a final foal (name unknown, by Three Card Trick).  It may have been the case that after 1965, she produced several more foals.\n\nLucia herself produced a few foals herself which include Titania (by Schapiro, born 1962), Caruso (by Pinicola, born 1963) and Queen of Hearts (by Three Card Trick, born 1965)\n\nLater showjumping horses included Flanagan (on which she won the Bronze medal in the [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|Team Jumping]] event at the 1956 Olympic games in Stockholm), Brigadoon, Scorchin, Mr Pollard, Ocean Foam and Telebrae.\n\nShe married after the Summer Olympics in 1960 to childhood friend [[Sam Koechlin]] and became '''Patricia Koechlin-Smythe'''.  This meant a move to Switzerland (as he was Swiss) and it was there that many of her books, including several [[pony books]] for children, were written.  Sam died in 1986 and Pat moved back to the [[Cotswolds]].\n\nPat's death came due to [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] when she was 67.\n\n==Books==\n\n===Biographies===\n*''Flanagan My Friend''\n*''Jump For Joy''\n*''Jumping Around the World''\n*''Leaping Life's Fences''\n*''One Jump Ahead''\n*''Tosca and Lucia''\n*''Florian's Farmyard''\n\n===Non fictional books===\n*''A Pony For Pleasure'' (co-author)\n*''Bred to Jump''\n*''Horses And Places''\n*''Pat Smythe's Book of Horses''\n*''Pony Problems''\n*''Salute the Horse'' (co-author)''\n*''Show Jumping''\n*''The Field Book of the Horse''\n*''Youth in the Saddle'' (co-author)\n\n(It is worth noting that although the above books were primarily aimed as an instruction manual, they are biographical to a certain extent, as they contain anecdotes about her horses.)\n\n===Fictional books===\n\n====Three Jays Series====\n*''Jacqueline Rides for a Fall '' (Cassel, 1957)\n*''Three Jays Against The Clock'' (Cassel, 1958)\n*''Three Jays on Holiday'' (Cassel, 1958)\n*''Three Jays Go To Town'' (Cassel, 1959)\n*''Three Jays Over The Border'' (Cassel, 1960)\n*''Three Jays Go To Rome'' (Cassel, 1960)\n*''Three Jays Lend A Hand'' (Cassel, 1961)\n\n(Note: The 'Three Jays' series of books featured herself in the story.

She competed at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] and the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], winning a bronze medal at the former.<ref name=\"SportsRef\">{{cite Sports-Reference |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/sm/pat-smythe-1.html |title=Pat Smythe Olympic Results |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref> She also wrote many books on equestrian themes, largely for children.\n\n==Early years==\nPat Smythe was the last of three children, the other two being Dicky and Ronald Smythe. Dicky died from [[pneumonia]] at the age of 4.  Her parents were [[Eric Hamilton Smythe]] and [[Frances Monica Curtoys]], who were born in the early 1900s.  She lived in London, on the outskirts of [[Richmond Park]].  Later she was a boarder at [[Talbot Heath School]] in [[Bournemouth]].\n\nPat nearly died when she was nearly 5 from [[diphtheria]].  Although she recovered fully, it meant that she had to learn to walk again. Hardship and suffering were to feature predominantly throughout her professional and personal life. Her father died when she was in her late teens, and her mother when she was 23.\n\n==War years==\nWorld War II brought times of separation for the family. In early 1940 her father was sent to Biskra in Algeria in search of a respite from his arthritis. Her mother remained in London working for the [[Red Cross]].\n\nDuring her father's return from North Africa via France, her mother set out to find him. She eventually found him in the town of [[Aix-les-Bains]]. Together they managed to get out of France, under enemy fire, on the very last boat leaving Bordeaux just before the Germans occupied the city and the majority of the rest of France.\n\nPat herself was sent to the [[Cotswolds]] (Ferne) for her safety, along with her pony, Pixie. Her brother had been [[Emergency evacuation|evacuated]] to [[Newquay]] in Devon, where his school had relocated.\n\nIt was during that time, whilst getting into an entanglement with several horses, that Pat met the King in the middle of the road. Unaware of who he was, she said to the driver of the car he was travelling in ''Shut up! Can't you see I'm trying to get these horses out of the road!''\n\nIn early 1941, Pat and her parents relocated to a house in the Cotswolds.  Her parents still had to work hard, and things were never easy. The house had to serve as a [[guest house (lodging)|guesthouse]], as well as a family home.\n\nIn 1949, after her father's death, Pat and her mother moved again, to [[Miserden]] in the Cotswolds.\n\n==Ponies and horses==\nSmythe's first ride was on a small pony known as Bubbles.  Although he was her brother's pony, she learned to ride on him but outgrew him eventually.  After that, her parents bought her a Dartmoor/Arab-cross pony named Pixie.  Pixie was later mated and gave birth to a filly called Vicky.\n\nPat's mother used to be sent [[polo pony|polo ponies]] by a friend of the family, [[Johnny Traill#References|Johnny Traill]], to break and be schooled for [[polo]] playing.  Although they were not hers, when she was older, Pat also helped school and break them.\n\nIt was not until Pat's relocation to the Cotswolds that her first taste of showjumping came with [[Finality (horse)|Finality]]. After varied success at [[gymkhana]]s and numerous injuries which Finality suffered, Pat was able to compete in her first International Show. Eventually she was asked to join the British team with Colonel [[Harry Llewellyn]], [[Ruby Holland-Martin]], [[Toby Robeson]] and [[Brian Butler (showjumper)|Brian Butler]] in 1947.  But the partnership with Finality was not to last. She had been lent to the family by [[Johnny Traill#References|Johnny Traill]] and, due to financial pressure, had to be sold.\n\nPat's next horse, the grey mare Carmena, came after the parting with Finality. Although Carmena was a talented and successful horse, Pat admitted that she could never feel the same closeness she had had with Finality.\n\nShortly after Carmena came another mare, Leona. Leona served Pat well until the death of her mother meant that finances became tight. Being the most valuable horse (at the time), Leona had to be sold.\n\nIn 1949, Pat acquired her cheapest horse, Prince Hal.  Bought as an ex-racehorse, he was initially named Fourtowns. \n\nTosca was Pat's next purchase.  She was born in 1945. It was her most successful partnership after Finality, winning many medals and major showjumping prizes of the day.  Tosca was one of the ones she most often competed abroad.  After Tosca's retirement from showjumping in the mid 1950s, she bred several foals, including Lucia (by Gay Scot, born 1957), Favourita (by Blue Duster, born 1958), Flamenca (by Tambourin, born 1959), Laurella (by Schapiro, born 1960), Prince Igor (by Shapiro born 1961), Chocolate Soldier (her sixth, by either Bitter Sweet or Cortachy, born 1962), Melba (by Pincola, born 1963), Sir John (by Shapiro, born 1964) and a final foal (name unknown, by Three Card Trick).

Since the early 1990s, with the successful sales of his albums, he has been a prominent figure of the [[Turkish pop music]], being known in both Turkey and Europe.\n\nTarkan was born and raised in [[Alzey]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. In 1986, he moved to Turkey together with his family. Tarkan, who had been interested in music since his childhood, went to high school at [[Karam\u00fcrsel]] and took music lessons. In the following years, he met the owner of \u0130stanbul Plak, Mehmet S\u00f6\u011f\u00fcto\u011flu, and signed a contract to release his own album.\n\nTarkan released his first album ''[[Yine Sensiz]]'' in late 1992 with \"K\u0131l Oldum\" being chosen as its [[lead single]]. His second and third albums, ''[[Aacayipsin]]'' and ''[[\u00d6l\u00fcr\u00fcm Sana]]'', were released in 1994 and 1998 respectively. The song \"[[\u015e\u0131mar\u0131k]]\" from ''\u00d6l\u00fcr\u00fcm Sana'' became popular in a number of countries. In 1998, he signed a new contract with [[Universal Music Group]]. In 1999, his compilation album, ''[[Tarkan (album)|Tarkan]]'', received platinum and gold certifications in several countries. In 2001, he made music videos for the songs \"[[Kuzu Kuzu]], \"H\u00fcp\" and \"Verme\" from his fourth studio album ''[[Karma (Tarkan album)|Karma]]''. Two years later, the album ''[[Dudu (album)|Dudu]]'' performed well on the sales charts, and in 2006 with the release of his first English album, ''[[Come Closer (album)|Come Closer]]'', he became known in Europe. \"[[Bounce (Tarkan song)|Bounce]]\" and \"[[Start the Fire (Tarkan song)|Start the Fire]]\" were the lead singles of this album. The lyrics of the songs included in the album ''[[Metamorfoz]]'' were praised by the [[Turkish Language Association]]. In 2010, his seventh studio album, ''[[Ad\u0131m\u0131 Kalbine Yaz]]'', became the best-selling album of the year in Turkey. In 2016, his ninth studio album, ''[[Ahde Vefa]]'', which has a [[Ottoman classical music|Classical Turkish theme]], was released.\n\nAlongside his music career, Tarkan has taken part in numerous social projects and is known as \"Megastar\" and \"Prince of the [[Bosporus]]\" in the press.<ref>Tarkan's titles appearing in a number of sources:\n*{{cite news | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yasam/2010/11/30/tarkandan_enbeye_destek | title = Tarkan'dan Enbe'ye destek | accessdate = 14 December 2010 | newspaper = [[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] | date = 30 November 2010 | first = Deniz | last = Avc\u0131 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305041911/http://www.sabah.com.tr/yasam/2010/11/30/tarkandan_enbeye_destek | archivedate = 5 March 2016}}\n*{{cite web | url = http://www.rfimusique.com/musiqueen/articles/060/article_6847.asp | title = Tarkan | accessdate = 14 December 2010 | publisher = rfimusique.com | date = 28 January 1999 | first = Pascale | last = Hamon | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305033700/http://www.rfimusique.com/musiqueen/articles/060/article_6847.asp | archivedate = 5 March 2016}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsdalesites.org/collegian/128/128_9/arts/musicreview.htm|title=Turk Prince of Pop|date=11 November 2004|website=Hillsdalesites.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010161008/http://www.hillsdalesites.org/collegian/128/128_9/arts/musicreview.htm|archivedate=10 October 2010}}</ref> One of few European singers who has managed to span chart success without singing in English, he is also noted for his live stage performances.

The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when one or more of the thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged.<ref name=\":1\" /> Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the \"idle\" setting required for automatic spoiler deployment.<ref name=\"DFDR\"/> Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the \"climb\" detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.\n\n=== Timeline ===\nSource:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.desastresaereos.net/acidentetam3054.htm#O_acidente|title=DESASTRES AEREOS - ACIDENTE TAM JJ 3054 - \u00cdNDICE|website=www.desastresaereos.net|language=Portuguese|trans-title=AIR DISASTERS - ACIDOR TAM JJ 3054 - INDEX|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%; width:65%; text-align: center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Time\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Event\n|-\n![[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]\n!Local time ([[UTC\u221203:00]])\n|-\n|20:19\n|17:19\n| align=\"left\" |Flight 3054 departs Porto Alegre airport.\n|-\n|21:20\n|18:20\n| align=\"left\" |The flight begins its approach to [[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Congonhas Airport|Congonhas airport]].\n|-\n|21:43\n|18:43\n| align=\"left\" |The pilots perform the landing checklist.\n|-\n|21:47\n|18:47\n| align=\"left\" |Flight 3054 is cleared to land on runway 35L.\n|-\n|21:48:24\n|18:48:24\n| align=\"left\" |Thrust levers are positioned incorrectly.\n|-\n|21:48:26\n|18:48:26\n| align=\"left\" |Flight 3054 lands on the runway.\n|-\n|21:48:30\n|18:48:30\n| align=\"left\" |The aircraft begins to veer left.\n|-\n|21:48:40\n|18:48:40\n| align=\"left\" |The aircraft overshoots the runway.\n|-\n|21:48:50\n|18:48:50\n| align=\"left\" |The aircraft crashes into the TAM Express building.\n|}\n\n\n==Congonhas==\n[[Image:Tamexpress.jpg|left|thumb|The [[TAM Express]] warehouse before the crash]]\n[[Image:Acidentetam0.jpg|right|thumb|The TAM Express warehouse on fire shortly after the crash]]\n[[Image:Acidentetam9.jpg|right|thumb|Another angle of the TAM Express warehouse on fire shortly after the crash]]\n[[Image:Voo TAM 3054 crash 10.jpg|thumb|The burnt-out warehouse after the crash]]\nAviation safety in Brazil had been under increased scrutiny following the mid-air collision in September 2006 over the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] of [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos]] [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos Flight 1907|Flight 1907]] and an [[Embraer Legacy 600]] (see [[Brazil's 2006-2007 aviation crisis]]).

They also said that the National Civil Aviation Agency should have closed the airport on the night the plane landed because of heavy rains; that Congonhas airport authorities shared the blame because its runway had not been properly constructed with grooves to drain away excess rainwater, contributing to the crash;   that the plane's manufacturer, Airbus, should have provided alarms warning the pilots that the braking system was failing; and that TAM failed to properly train its pilots, who did not act correctly in the emergency.\n\n===Final report===\nIn September 2009, more than two years after the accident, CENIPA announced the results of official investigations. The report shows that one of the thrust levers, which control engines, was in position to accelerate when it should be in idle, but it was not proved if there was mechanical or human failure as the cause of the accident.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u646127.shtml|title=Sem apontar culpados, Aeron\u00e1utica divulga relat\u00f3rio sobre acidente da TAM|newspaper=[[Folha de S.

In the first, there was a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. The occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.\n\nIn addition to the positions of the thrust levers, the report points to several factors that may have contributed to the accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions that TAM had rejected.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Response==\n[[File:Brasilia em Luto TAM.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Flag of Brazil|Brazilian flag]] being flown at [[half-mast]] in [[Bras\u00edlia]] following the accident]]\nAfter the crash, President [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]] ordered three days of [[national day of mourning|national mourning]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/SaoPaulo/0,,MUL72081-5605,00.html|title=Luto oficial de tr\u00eas dias por acidente da TAM|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|language=Portuguese|trans-title=Three-day official mourning for TAM accident}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2007 Pan American Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the Brazilian athletes wore a black armband in remembrance of the victims.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-18-voa74.cfm|title=Brazilian Athletes Mourn Plane Crash Victims|author=David Byrd|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=July 18, 2007|accessdate=July 23, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070818144209/http://voanews.com/english/2007-07-18-voa74.cfm |archivedate = August 18, 2007}}</ref> The flags of all participating countries were flown at [[half mast]] on July 18.

The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when one or more of the thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged.<ref name=\":1\" /> Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the \"idle\" setting required for automatic spoiler deployment.<ref name=\"DFDR\"/> Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the \"climb\" detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.\n\n=== Timeline ===\nSource:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.desastresaereos.net/acidentetam3054.htm#O_acidente|title=DESASTRES AEREOS - ACIDENTE TAM JJ 3054 - \u00cdNDICE|website=www.desastresaereos.net|language=Portuguese|trans-title=AIR DISASTERS - ACIDOR TAM JJ 3054 - INDEX|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%; width:65%; text-align: center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Time\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Event\n|-\n![[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]\n!Local time ([[UTC\u221203:00]])\n|-\n|20:19\n|17:19\n| align=\"left\" |Flight 3054 departs Porto Alegre airport.\n|-\n|21:20\n|18:20\n| align=\"left\" |The flight begins its approach to [[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Congonhas Airport|Congonhas airport]].\n|-\n|21:43\n|18:43\n| align=\"left\" |The pilots perform the landing checklist.\n|-\n|21:47\n|18:47\n| align=\"left\" |Flight 3054 is cleared to land on runway 35L.\n|-\n|21:48:24\n|18:48:24\n| align=\"left\" |Thrust levers are positioned incorrectly.\n|-\n|21:48:26\n|18:48:26\n| align=\"left\" |Flight 3054 lands on the runway.\n|-\n|21:48:30\n|18:48:30\n| align=\"left\" |The aircraft begins to veer left.\n|-\n|21:48:40\n|18:48:40\n| align=\"left\" |The aircraft overshoots the runway.\n|-\n|21:48:50\n|18:48:50\n| align=\"left\" |The aircraft crashes into the TAM Express building.\n|}\n\n\n==Congonhas==\n[[Image:Tamexpress.jpg|left|thumb|The [[TAM Express]] warehouse before the crash]]\n[[Image:Acidentetam0.jpg|right|thumb|The TAM Express warehouse on fire shortly after the crash]]\n[[Image:Acidentetam9.jpg|right|thumb|Another angle of the TAM Express warehouse on fire shortly after the crash]]\n[[Image:Voo TAM 3054 crash 10.jpg|thumb|The burnt-out warehouse after the crash]]\nAviation safety in Brazil had been under increased scrutiny following the mid-air collision in September 2006 over the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] of [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos]] [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos Flight 1907|Flight 1907]] and an [[Embraer Legacy 600]] (see [[Brazil's 2006-2007 aviation crisis]]).

They also said that the National Civil Aviation Agency should have closed the airport on the night the plane landed because of heavy rains; that Congonhas airport authorities shared the blame because its runway had not been properly constructed with grooves to drain away excess rainwater, contributing to the crash;   that the plane's manufacturer, Airbus, should have provided alarms warning the pilots that the braking system was failing; and that TAM failed to properly train its pilots, who did not act correctly in the emergency.\n\n===Final report===\nIn September 2009, more than two years after the accident, CENIPA announced the results of official investigations.

In the first, there was a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. The occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.\n\nIn addition to the positions of the thrust levers, the report points to several factors that may have contributed to the accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions that TAM had rejected.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Response==\n[[File:Brasilia em Luto TAM.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Flag of Brazil|Brazilian flag]] being flown at [[half-mast]] in [[Bras\u00edlia]] following the accident]]\nAfter the crash, President [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]] ordered three days of [[national day of mourning|national mourning]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/SaoPaulo/0,,MUL72081-5605,00.html|title=Luto oficial de tr\u00eas dias por acidente da TAM|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|language=Portuguese|trans-title=Three-day official mourning for TAM accident}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2007 Pan American Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the Brazilian athletes wore a black armband in remembrance of the victims.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-18-voa74.cfm|title=Brazilian Athletes Mourn Plane Crash Victims|author=David Byrd|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=July 18, 2007|accessdate=July 23, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070818144209/http://voanews.com/english/2007-07-18-voa74.cfm |archivedate = August 18, 2007}}</ref> The flags of all participating countries were flown at [[half mast]] on July 18.
