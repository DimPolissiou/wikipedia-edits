At age 25, he was the youngest Brazilian mayor. He was elected a federal deputy for two terms, (1983\u20131987 and 1987\u20131994), distinguishing himself by authoring consumer protection laws. In 1988, he was one of the founders of the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB).\n\nHe was elected vice [[governor of S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[M\u00e1rio Covas]]'s running-mate first in the 1994 election and then again in 1998. With the death of Covas, he assumed the governorship of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo in March, 2001, he continued Covas' policies, investing in large, state-run projects, health and education programs. All of these investments were possible through   [[privatization]] programs that sold off public and state-owned companies. He was elected governor on October 27, 2002, through a [[runoff election]], for the 2003\u20132006 term, with 12 million votes (or 58.64%). His current administration is marked by a reduction in the state payroll from 49% to 46% of the state's budget, the unification of purchasing systems and other \"smart spending\" initiatives, as well as the implementation of [[Public-Private Partnership]]s (PPPs).\n\n==2006 presidential election==\nOn March 14, 2006, [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]] nominated Alckmin as its candidate for president in the [[2006 Brazilian general election|2006 elections]]. Because of electoral rules, no candidate running for office may currently be in an executive office, forcing him to resign the governorship on March 31, 2006. [[Cl\u00e1udio Lembo]], the [[lieutenant governor]], finished Alckmin's term. Alckmin's party mate, [[Jos\u00e9 Serra]], the PSDB's presidential standard-bearer who lost to Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in 2002, then announced his candidacy to replace Alckmin in the 2006 state elections. Serra won the vote in Brazil's first round elections on October 1, 2006 and was elected as the governor of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nContrary to all major polls taken in the run-up to the October 1, 2006 balloting, Alckmin surprised almost everyone and came in second place in the presidential election{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

At age 25, he was the youngest Brazilian mayor. He was elected a federal deputy for two terms, (1983\u20131987 and 1987\u20131994), distinguishing himself by authoring consumer protection laws. In 1988, he was one of the founders of the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB).\n\nHe was elected vice [[governor of S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[M\u00e1rio Covas]]'s running-mate first in the 1994 election and then again in 1998. With the death of Covas, he assumed the governorship of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo in March, 2001, he continued Covas' policies, investing in large, state-run projects, health and education programs. All of these investments were possible through   [[privatization]] programs that sold off public and state-owned companies. He was elected governor on October 27, 2002, through a [[runoff election]], for the 2003-2006 term, with 12 million votes (or 58.64%). His current administration is marked by a reduction in the state payroll from 49% to 46% of the state's budget, the unification of purchasing systems and other \"smart spending\" initiatives, as well as the implementation of [[Public-Private Partnership]]s (PPPs).\n\n==2006 presidential election==\nOn March 14, 2006, [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]] nominated Alckmin as its candidate for President in the [[2006 Brazilian general election|2006 elections]]. Because of electoral rules, no candidate running for office may currently be in an executive office, forcing him to resign the governorship on March 31, 2006. [[Cl\u00e1udio Lembo]], the [[lieutenant governor]], finished Alckmin's term. Alckmin's party mate, [[Jos\u00e9 Serra]], the PSDB's presidential standard-bearer who lost to Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in 2002, then announced his candidacy to replace Alckmin in the 2006 state elections. Serra won the vote in Brazil's first round elections on October 1, 2006 and was elected as the governor of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nContrary to all major polls taken in the run-up to the October 1, 2006 balloting, Alckmin surprised almost everyone and came in second place in the presidential election{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

Between her mother\u2019s love for [[Motown]] and her father\u2019s dedication to jazz, Wilson\u2019s parents sparked her early interest in music.<ref name=\"Leland\">[[John Leland (journalist)|Leland, John]].

Instead, he gave her a lesson in self-reliance, suggesting she study [[Mel Bay]] method books. Wilson explored guitar on her own, developing what she has described as an \"intuitive\" approach. During this time she began writing her own songs, adopting a [[folk music|folk style]]. She also appeared in the musical theater productions, including ''[[The Wizard of Oz (adaptations)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' as Dorothy, crossing racial lines in a recently desegregated school system.\n\nWilson attended [[Millsaps College]] and [[Jackson State University]]. She graduated with a degree in [[mass communications]]. Outside of the classroom, she spent her nights working with R&B, funk, and pop [[cover band]]s, also singing in local coffeehouses. The Black Arts Music Society, founded by John Reese and [[Alvin Fielder]], provided her with her first opportunities to perform [[bebop]]. In 2007, Wilson received her Ph.D in Arts from [[Millsaps College]].\n\nIn 1981, she moved to New Orleans for a position as assistant public affairs director for the local television station, WDSU. She did not stay long. Working with mentors who included elder statesmen Earl Turbinton, [[Alvin Batiste]], and [[Ellis Marsalis, Jr.|Ellis Marsalis]], Wilson found encouragement to seriously pursue jazz performance and moved to New York City the following year.\n\n==Musical association with M-Base==\nIn New York, Wilson's focus turned towards improvisation. Heavily influenced by singers [[Abbey Lincoln]] and [[Betty Carter]], she fine-tuned her vocal phrasing and [[scat singing|scat]] while studying [[ear training]] with trombonist [[Grachan Moncur, III]]. Frequenting jam sessions under the tutelage of pianist [[Sadik Hakim]], a [[Charlie Parker]] alumnus, she met alto saxophonist [[Steve Coleman]], who encouraged her to look beyond the standard jazz repertoire in favor of developing original material. She would become the vocalist and one of the founding members of the [[M-Base]] collective in which Coleman was the leading figure, a stylistic outgrowth of the [[Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians]] (AACM) and [[Black Artists Group]] (BAG) that re-imagined the grooves of funk and soul within the context of traditional and [[avant-garde jazz]]. Peter Watrous in an article for ''[[The New York Times]]'' states:\n\n<blockquote>The M-Base group in Brooklyn, working with both jazz and pop forms, makes music that at first sounds like funk from the 1970s. Like the music played by Mr. Marsalis (and his brother [[Wynton Marsalis|Wynton]]) the music made by M-Base - Steve Coleman, with [[Greg Osby]], Cassandra Wilson and [[Geri Allen]] \u2013 is, at its best, filled with subtle ideas working behind the mask of popular music. In Mr. Coleman's group a singer is supported by an electric bass, guitar, drums and electric keyboards, a shiny musical mix that has familiar rock and funk references; yet, because of all its rhythmic and metric manipulations, sounds new.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/31/arts/pop-view-private-codes-enliven-jazz.html |title=POP VIEW: Private Codes Enliven Jazz |first=Peter |last=Watrous |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 31, 1989}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough the voice \u2013 typically treated as the focal point of any arrangement in which it is included \u2013 was not an obvious choice for M-Base's complex textures or harmonically elaborated melodies, Wilson wove herself into the fabric of these settings with wordless improv and lyrics.

She released her first recording as a leader ''[[Point of View (Cassandra Wilson album)|Point of View]]'' in 1986.

Her throaty [[contralto]] gradually emerges over the course of these recordings, making its way to the foreground. She developed a remarkable ability to stretch and bend pitches, elongate syllables, manipulate tone and timbre from dusky to hollow.<ref>[[Brian Priestley]], [[Digby Fairweather]], [[Ian Carr]].

Her signing with [[Blue Note Records]] in 1993 marked a crucial turning point in her career and major breakthrough to audiences beyond jazz with albums selling in the hundreds of thousands of copies.\n\nBeginning with ''[[Blue Light 'Til Dawn]]'' (1993) her repertoire moved towards a broad synthesis of blues, pop, jazz, world music, and country. Although she continued to perform originals and standards, she adopted songs as diverse as [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"[[Come On in My Kitchen]]\", [[Joni Mitchell]]'s \"Black Crow\", [[The Monkees]]' \"[[Last Train to Clarksville]]\", and [[Hank Williams]]' \"[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]\".\n\nWilson's 1996 album ''[[New Moon Daughter]]'' won the [[Grammy]] for [[Best Jazz Vocal Performance]]. In 1997, she recorded and toured as a featured vocalist with [[Wynton Marsalis]]' [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning composition, ''[[Blood on the Fields]]''.\n\n[[Miles Davis]] was one of Wilson's greatest influences. In 1989, Wilson performed as the opening act for Davis at the [[JVC Jazz Festival]] in Chicago. In 1999 she produced ''[[Traveling Miles]]'' as a tribute to Davis. The album developed from a series of jazz concerts that she performed at [[Lincoln Center]] in November 1997 in Davis' honor, and includes three selections based on Davis' own compositions, from which Wilson adapted the original themes.\n\n==Personal life==\nWilson was married to Anthony Wilson from 1981 to 1983.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/29/garden/in-the-studio-with-cassandra-wilson-singing-a-song-of-the-south.html | work=The New York Times | title=IN THE STUDIO WITH: Cassandra Wilson; Singing a Song of the South | first=Charisse | last=Jones | date=September 29, 1994}}</ref>\n\nShe has a son, Jeris, born in the late 1980s.

''[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/644655/Cassandra-Wilson Cassandra Wilson],'' [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]</ref> and Mary McDaniel, an elementary school teacher who earned her PhD in education. Her ancestry includes [[Fon people|Fon]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]]. Between her mother\u2019s love for [[Motown]] and her father\u2019s dedication to jazz, Wilson\u2019s parents sparked her early interest in music.<ref name=\"Leland\">[[John Leland (journalist)|Leland, John]]. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/07/garden/going-home-with-cassandra-wilson-jazz-diva-follows-sound-of-her-roots.html?ref=cassandra_wilson&pagewanted=2 GOING HOME WITH: Cassandra Wilson; Jazz Diva Follows Sound of Her Roots],'' ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 7, 2002</ref>\n\nWilson\u2019s earliest formal musical education consisted of classical lessons; she studied piano from the age of six to thirteen and played clarinet in the middle school concert and [[marching band]]s.<ref name=\"Leland\" /> When she was tired of this training, she asked her father to teach her the guitar. Instead, he gave her a lesson in self-reliance, suggesting she study [[Mel Bay]] method books. Wilson explored guitar on her own, developing what she has described as an \"intuitive\" approach. During this time she began writing her own songs, adopting a [[folk music|folk style]]. She also appeared in the musical theater productions, including ''[[The Wizard of Oz (adaptations)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' as Dorothy, crossing racial lines in a recently desegregated school system.\n\nWilson attended [[Millsaps College]] and [[Jackson State University]]. She graduated with a degree in [[mass communications]]. Outside of the classroom, she spent her nights working with R&B, funk, and pop [[cover band]]s, also singing in local coffeehouses. The Black Arts Music Society, founded by John Reese and [[Alvin Fielder]], provided her with her first opportunities to perform [[bebop]]. In 2007, Wilson received her Ph.D in Arts from [[Millsaps College]].\n\nIn 1981, she moved to New Orleans for a position as assistant public affairs director for the local television station, WDSU. She did not stay long. Working with mentors who included elder statesmen Earl Turbinton, [[Alvin Batiste]], and [[Ellis Marsalis, Jr.|Ellis Marsalis]], Wilson found encouragement to seriously pursue jazz performance and moved to New York City the following year.\n\n==Musical association with M-Base==\nIn New York, Wilson's focus turned towards improvisation. Heavily influenced by singers [[Abbey Lincoln]] and [[Betty Carter]], she fine-tuned her vocal phrasing and [[scat singing|scat]] while studying [[ear training]] with trombonist [[Grachan Moncur, III]]. Frequenting jam sessions under the tutelage of pianist [[Sadik Hakim]], a [[Charlie Parker]] alumnus, she met alto saxophonist [[Steve Coleman]], who encouraged her to look beyond the standard jazz repertoire in favor of developing original material. She would become the vocalist and one of the founding members of the [[M-Base]] collective in which Coleman was the leading figure, a stylistic outgrowth of the [[Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians]] (AACM) and [[Black Artists Group]] (BAG) that re-imagined the grooves of funk and soul within the context of traditional and [[avant-garde jazz]]. Peter Watrous in an article for ''[[The New York Times]]'' states:\n\n<blockquote>The M-Base group in Brooklyn, working with both jazz and pop forms, makes music that at first sounds like funk from the 1970s. Like the music played by Mr. Marsalis (and his brother [[Wynton Marsalis|Wynton]]) the music made by M-Base - Steve Coleman, with [[Greg Osby]], Cassandra Wilson and [[Geri Allen]] \u2013 is, at its best, filled with subtle ideas working behind the mask of popular music.

[[Michael Harrington]] resigned and then formed the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (now the [[Democratic Socialists of America]], DSA) with the purpose of \"realignment\" strengthening the role of labor unions and other progressive organizations in the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] to pull it to the left.  The smallest and the most left wing faction of the SPA, known as the [[Debs Caucus]], including McReynolds, formed the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA).  McReynolds was long a member of both DSA and SPUSA.\n\nMcReynolds' primary theoretical contribution to socialism came from his blending of a [[pacifist]] world-view with a commitment to re-distributive [[socialist economics]].  Politically, he was a staunch [[anti-authoritarian]] and collaborated with a diverse set of political formations on the democratic left.  His widely read pamphlet, ''The Philosophy of Nonviolence'', provides a unique window into the mind of a lifelong activist wrestling with the contradictions and pitfalls which plagued the political left in the 20th century.  He concludes that \"...there is no living, vital philosophy which does not have 'holes' in it.\"  Consequently, he mapped out a [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] approach which is, on the one hand, socialist, yet is entirely engaged with thought systems as seemingly contradictory as [[Hindu philosophy]].  He concluded that a brand of pacifist-socialism is best suited for future socialist experiments since it offers the greatest opportunity to prefigure the kinds of democratic relations necessary to create a functional and free society.{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn his political career, McReynolds ran for [[United States Congress|Congress]] from [[Lower Manhattan]] twice and for [[President of the United States|President]] twice.  In 1958 he ran as a write-in SPA candidate and then in 1968 as a [[Peace and Freedom Party]] candidate for Congress in the 19th district pulling in 4.7% of the vote (3,969 votes).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1968election.pdf |title=Statistics of the Presidential and Congressional Election of November 5, 1968 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}</ref> In 1980, he ran for President of the United States as the SPUSA candidate, with [[Diane Drufenbrock]] as vice presidential candidate, receiving 6,994 votes (0.01%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1980&off=0 |title=1980 Presidential General Election Results |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}</ref><ref>Kari Lydersen.

[[Michael Harrington]] resigned and then formed the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (now the [[Democratic Socialists of America]], DSA) with the purpose of \"realignment\" strengthening the role of labor unions and other progressive organizations in the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] to pull it to the left.  The smallest and the most left wing faction of the SPA, known as the [[Debs Caucus]], including McReynolds, formed the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA).  McReynolds was long a member of both DSA and SPUSA.\n\nMcReynolds' primary theoretical contribution to socialism came from his blending of a [[pacifist]] world-view with a commitment to re-distributive [[socialist economics]].  Politically, he was a staunch [[anti-authoritarian]] and collaborated with a diverse set of political formations on the democratic left.  His widely read pamphlet, ''The Philosophy of Nonviolence'', provides a unique window into the mind of a lifelong activist wrestling with the contradictions and pitfalls which plagued the political left in the 20th century.  He concludes that \"...there is no living, vital philosophy which does not have 'holes' in it.\"  Consequently, he mapped out a [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] approach which is, on the one hand, socialist, yet is entirely engaged with thought systems as seemingly contradictory as [[Hindu philosophy]].  He concluded that a brand of pacifist-socialism is best suited for future socialist experiments since it offers the greatest opportunity to prefigure the kinds of democratic relations necessary to create a functional and free society.{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn his political career, McReynolds ran for [[United States Congress|Congress]] from [[Lower Manhattan]] twice and for [[President of the United States|President]] twice.  In 1958 he ran as a write-in SPA candidate and then in 1968 as a [[Peace and Freedom Party]] candidate for Congress in the 19th district pulling in 4.7% of the vote (3,969 votes).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1968election.pdf |title=Statistics of the Presidential and Congressional Election of November 5, 1968 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}</ref> In 1980, he ran for President of the United States as the SPUSA candidate, with [[Diane Drufenbrock]] as vice presidential candidate, receiving 6,994 votes (0.01%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1980&off=0 |title=1980 Presidential General Election Results |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}</ref><ref>Kari Lydersen.

He completed his [[Master of Arts]] and [[Master of Philosophy]] degrees in philosophy in 1991 at [[Yale University]], and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree with distinction from the same university in 1993. Following the completion of his doctoral studies, Gordon taught at [[Brown University]], Yale, [[Purdue University]], and [[Temple University]], where he was the [[Laura H. Carnell]] Professor of Philosophy in the Department of Philosophy with affiliations in Religious and Judaic Studies. He is currently Professor of Philosophy and Africana Studies, with affiliations in Judaic Studies and the Caribbean, Latino/a, and Latin American Studies, at the [[University of Connecticut]] at [[Storrs, Connecticut|Storrs]]. He also is Visiting Euro philosophy Professor at [[Toulouse University]], France, and Nelson Mandela Visiting Professor in Political and International Studies at [[Rhodes University]] in South Africa (2014\u20132016).\n\nAt Temple, he was Director of the Institute for the Study of Race and Social Thought (ISRST), which is devoted to research on the complexity and social dimensions of race and racism.  The ISRST's many projects include developing a consortium on Afro-Latin American Studies, a Philadelphia Blues People Project, semiological studies of indigeneity, a Black Civil Society project, symposia on race, sexuality, and sexual health, and ongoing work in Africana philosophy.  Gordon was Executive Editor of volumes I-V of ''[[Radical Philosophy Review]]: Journal of the Radical Philosophy Association'' and co-editor of the [[Routledge]] book series on [[Africana philosophy]].  Additionally, he is President of the Caribbean Philosophical Association.\n\nGordon is the founder of the Center for [[African Jews|Afro-Jewish]] Studies, the only such research center, which focuses on developing and providing reliable sources of information on [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and African Diasporic Jewish or [[Hebrews|Hebrew]]-descended populations.  Gordon states: \"In actuality, there is no such thing as pure Jewish blood. Jews are a creolized [mixed-race] people. It's been that way since at least the time we left [[Egypt]] as a [culturally] mixed Egyptian and African [i.e., from other parts of Africa] people.\"\n\nGordon founded the Second Chance Program at [[Herbert H. Lehman High School|Lehman High School]] in the [[Bronx, New York]]. He is married to Jane Anna Gordon.\n\n== Philosophy and work in theory ==\n\n===Black existentialism===\nGordon is considered among the leading scholars in [[black existentialism]].<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 56| pages = 72\u201384| last1 = Linwood G.

The book is written in four parts, with a series of short chapters that at times take the form of phenomenological vignettes. Bad faith, as Gordon reads it, is a coextensive phenomenon reflective of the metastability of the human condition.  It is a denial of human reality, an effort to evade freedom, a flight from responsibility, a choice against choice, an assertion of being the only point of view on the world, an assertion of being the world, an effort to deny having a point of view, a flight from displeasing truths to pleasing falsehoods, a form of misanthropy, an act of believing what one does not believe, a form of spirit of seriousness, sincerity, an effort to disarm evidence (a Gordon innovation), a form of sedimented or institutional version of all of these, and (another Gordon innovation) a flight from and war against social reality.  Gordon rejects notions of disembodied [[consciousness]] (which he argues are forms of bad faith) and articulates a theory of the body-in-bad-faith.  Gordon also rejects authenticity discourses.  He sees them as trapped in expectations of sincerity, which also is a form of bad faith.  He proposes, instead, critical good faith, which he argues requires respect for evidence and accountability in the social world, a world of intersubjective relations.\n\n=== The question of racism ===\n[[Racism]], Gordon argues,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} requires the rejection of another human being's humanity.  Since the other human being is a human being, such a rejection is a contradiction of reality.  A racist must, then, deny reality, and since communication is possible between a racist and the people who are the object of racial hatred, then social reality is also what is denied in racist assertions.  A racist, then, attempts to avoid social reality.  Gordon argues that since people could only \"appear\" if embodied, then racism is an attack on embodied realities.  It is an effort to make embodied realities bodies without points of view or make points of views without bodies.   Racism is also a form of the spirit of seriousness, by which Gordon means the treatment of values as material features of the world instead of expressions of human freedom and responsibility.  Racism ascribes to so-called racially inferior people intrinsic values that emanate from their flesh.  A result of the spirit of seriousness is racist rationality.  Here, Gordon, in agreement with [[Frantz Fanon]], argues that racists are not irrational people but instead hyper-rational expressions of racist rationality.  He rejects, in other words, theories that regard racism as a function of bad emotions or passions.  Such phenomena, he suggests, emerge as a consequence of racist thinking, not its cause.  Effect emerges, in other words, to affect how one negotiates reality.  If one is not willing to deal with time, a highly emotional response squeezes all time into a single moment, which leads to the overflow of what one prefers to believe over what one is afraid of facing.\n\nGordon analyzes a variety of issues in the study of anti-black racism, such as black antiblack racists, exoticism, racial \u201cqualities,\u201d and theological-ethical dimensions of racism.  He prefers to focus on anti-black racism instead of \u201c[[white supremacy]]\u201d because, he points out, that anti-black racism could exist without white supremacy.  There are many people who reject white supremacy but affirm notions of black inferiority.  A prime example is that there are black antiblack racists.  Gordon analyzes this phenomenon through a discussion of black use of the word \u201c[[nigger]],\u201d which he argues is bad faith effort at black self-exceptionalism\u2014of, in the case of the user of the term, not being its object.  Exoticism is the other extreme.  It is a rejection of the humanity of black people under the pretense of loving black people.  The exoticist valorizes black people because he or she regards black people as, like animals, incapable of valid judgment.\n\n=== Theology and history-ethics ===\nGordon argues{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} that in theological form, studies of anti-black racism reveal that a particular assumption of [[Western world|Western]] [[ethical]] thought must be rejected \u2013 the notion of similarity as a condition of ethical obligation.  That black woman could worship a god with whom they are neither similar nor could ever be identical demonstrates that love does not require similarity.  Gordon argues that the ethical issue against anti-black racism is not one of seeing the similarity between blacks and whites but of being able, simply, to respect and see the ethical importance of blacks as blacks.  The fight against racism, in other words, does not require the elimination of race or noticing the racial difference but instead demands to respect the humanity of the people who exemplify racial difference.  In ''Existence in Black'', Gordon outlines themes of black existentialism in the text's introduction.  He argues that black existentialism addresses many of the same themes of European existentialism but with some key differences.  For instance, although both sets argue that the notion of a human being makes no sense outside of human communities and that individuals make no sense without society and societies make no sense without individuals, European existentialists had to defend individuality more because they were normative in their societies, whereas black existentialists had to focus on community more in order to demonstrate their membership in the human community.  The question of individuality for black existentialists becomes one of showing that not all black people are the same. Themes of anguish, dread, freedom, absurdity, and death are examined, as well, through the historical reality of anti-black racism and [[colonialism]] and, along with it, the meaning of black suffering and the legitimacy of black existence.  The logic of anti-black racism demands blacks offering justifications for their existence that are not posed for whites.\n\nGordon points{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} these dynamics out through discussions of [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois]]'s observation that black people are often treated as problems instead of people who face problems in the world and Frantz Fanon's call for black people to become actional through transcending the dialectics of seeking white recognition.  Gordon also argues that black existential philosophy is an area of thought, which means that contributions to its development can come from anyone who understands its problematics. In other words, one does not have to be black to contribute to this area of thought.  ''Existence in Black'' reflects his point since it has articles by other authors from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds discussing themes ranging from African and [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|Afro-Caribbean]] existential struggles with beliefs in predestination to black [[feminist]] struggles with postmodern anti-essentialist thought.  Gordon's chapter in the book focuses on the problem of black invisibility, which he points out is paradoxical since it is a function of black people being hyper-visible.  Gordon's place in this area of thought was solidified in 2000 with the publication of his book ''Existentia Africana: Understanding Africana Existential Thought''.  That book explores themes of existence\u2014which he points out, from its Latin etymology, means to stand out or to appear\u2014over the course of examining a set of new philosophical themes that emerge from their convergence with realities faced by African diasporic peoples.  Gordon argues that traditional philosophical questions are not the only ones that philosophers should look at.  Gordon examines, as a matter of philosophical interest, topics ranging from the stratification of blacks in biographical discourses to the difficulty of studying black people as human beings.  He rejects the notion that existential philosophy is incompatible with religious thought.  To support his position, he examines how religion poses not only unique questions of paths to be taken in struggles for liberation, but also of the conditions that make religious practices such as worship possible.  He ends that work with a reflection on writing, in which he advances his own commitment to transcendental philosophical approaches, those, in other words, that explore the conditions by which and through which certain phenomena are able to manifest themselves or become possible.  Crucial here is that Gordon does not pit existential philosophy against transcendental philosophy but, instead, argues for both.\n\n=== Phenomenology and colonialism ===\nGordon is also known{{By whom|date=February 2012}} as the founder of postcolonial [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the leading proponent of Africana phenomenology which has enabled him to make a mark in Fanon Studies.  Gordon was able to develop [[postcolonial]] phenomenology, which he sometimes refers to as Africana phenomenology or de-colonial phenomenology, through making a series of important innovations to [[Husserl]]ian and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartrian]] phenomenologies.  The first, and perhaps most important, is his transformation of parenthesizing and bracketing of the natural attitude into what he calls \"ontological suspension\". Although Husserl called for a suspension of the natural attitude, his goal was primarily [[epistemology|epistemological]].  Gordon's interest is, however, primarily concerned with errors that occur from inappropriate [[ontological]] assertions.  He is also concerned with metaphysics, which he, unlike many contemporary thinkers, does not reject.  Instead, he sees the continuation of [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] metaphysics, which advances a notion of substance that is governed by the essence that leads to the definition in the form of essential being, as a problem.  Gordon wants to talk about the social world and the meanings constructed by it without reducing it to a [[physicalism|physicalist]] ontology.  The notion of ontological suspension, which he claims is compatible with [[Husserl#The elaboration of phenomenology|Husserlian phenomenology]], advances this effort.  He also advances phenomenology as a form of radically self-reflective thought, which means that it must question even its methodological assumptions.  Because of this, it must resist epistemological colonization, and it is in this sense that phenomenology is itself postcolonial or decolonizing.  Because of this, Gordon refused for some time in his career to refer to his work as \u201cphilosophy,\u201d for that would mean colonizing it with a disciplinary set of assumptions.  He preferred to call his work \u201cradical thought,\u201d which for him meant being willing to go to the roots of reality in a critical way.  From these moves, Gordon was able to generate a set of theoretical concepts that have become useful to those who have adopted his theoretical lexicon: his unique formulation of crisis; his theory of [[epistemic closure]]; his theory of disciplinary decadence and teleological suspension of disciplinarity; and his analysis of maturation and tragedy.\n\nMost of these ideas first emerged in the work that gave Gordon a reputation in Fanon studies\u2014namely, ''Fanon and the Crisis of European Man: An Essay on Philosophy and the Human Sciences'' (1995).  Gordon introduced a new stage in Fanon studies by announcing that he was not interested in writing on Fanon but instead working with Fanon on the advancement of his (Gordon's) own intellectual project.  Fanon was thus an occasion or point of departure but not the main object of the study.  The work is, then, a statement more of Gordon's philosophy than that of Fanon, who, in this text, is more a major influence.  The book offers several innovations to the question of colonialism and the human sciences.  First, Gordon argues that crises are really human communities refusing to make the choices necessary for the transformation of realities created by human agency.  In short, they are forms of choices against choice or choosing not to choose, which amounts to bad faith.  History, he argued, must transcend the imposition of world history (and thus become structured as a crisis) and move toward an existential-historical understanding of human communities on the basis of critical good faith.  Phenomena such as racism and colonialism, because they attempt to erase the humanity of the colonized and object of racism, place challenges on whether it is possible to study human communities without collapsing into acts of discursive, imperial practices.\n\nGordon has also made an important contribution to the understanding around the work of [[Steve Biko]] by way of a new introduction to Biko's classic text ''[[I Write What I Like]]''.<ref>[http://abahlali.org/node/3039 New Introduction by Lewis Gordon] to Steve Biko's ''I Write What I Like''.</ref>\n\n=== Essentialism and race ===\nFor some scholars,{{who|date=February 2012}} [[essentialism]] means that one cannot study race and racism and colonialism properly because of they, in effect, lack essences.  Gordon argues that although human beings are incomplete, are without laws of nature, it does not follow that they cannot be studied and understood with reasonable accuracy.  Drawing upon the thought of [[Max Weber]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Alfred Schutz]], and [[Frantz Fanon]], Gordon argued that the task is to develop accurate portrayals or to thematize everyday life.  He argues that racism and colonialism are everyday phenomena and, as such, are lived as \"normal\" aspects of modern life.   Even under severe conditions, human beings find ways to live as though under ordinary conditions.  This ordinariness can get to a point of distorting reality.  In the case of racism, one group of people are allowed to live an ordinary life under ordinary conditions while another group or other groups are expected to do so under extraordinary conditions.  Institutional bad faith renders those extraordinary conditions invisible and advances as a norm the false notion a shared ordinary set of conditions.  This is the meaning behind the colloquial notion of \"double standards\".  Gordon here also advances a theory that provides an answer to [[social constructivism|social constructivists]] in the study of race.  What they fail to understand, Gordon argues, is that sociality is also constructed, which makes social constructivism redundant.\n\nMany social constructivists{{who|date=February 2012}} also treat the identification of constructive as the conclusion of the argument instead of its beginning. For Gordon, identifying that something is constructed does not mean showing that the phenomenon is false or fictional.  Human beings construct many \"real\" things, such as language and meaning and the forms of life generated by such activities and concepts.  Many people are able, for instance, to act on race concepts (not racist ones) with a fair degree of accuracy.  What this means is simply that they know how to read the social world and the bodies through which that world is manifested.  The error that many critics make is that they demand the false criterion of universality and infallibility to the practice of racial identification.  Gordon argues that such a demand would not work for the identification of most social phenomena.  What is required is not universality nor infallibility but generality.  Gordon defends this claim by making the distinction between a law and a principle.  Law is absolute, without exceptions, categorical.  A principle is general and has exceptions.  For things human, principles are more appropriate ascriptions than laws.  Gordon argues that these ideas emerged through his reading of Fanon's notions of sociogenesis.\n\nOther ideas he borrows from Fanon are his rejection of the dialectics of recognition and his unique view on racism's impact on ethics and the concept of the Other.  Like Fanon, Gordon argues that to seek white recognition leads to dependency on whites.  It also means to make whites the standard of value.  Yet Gordon rejects the thesis that racism is about a Self\u2013Other dialectic.  Antiblack racists do not see blacks as the Other or others, in Gordon's view.  Such relations only exist between whites and whomever else they see as human beings or genuine others.  Thus, the struggle against anti-black racism is ironically for blacks to become others.  This displacement of otherness means that the fight against racism is governed not by moral laws but by tragic ones in which innocence becomes irrelevant.  Gordon concludes the work with a look at how two scholars read Fanon's importance: [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], argued that only Fanon's biography is of any contemporary interest, and that is as good literature.  [[Cedric Robinson]] argued that Gates failed to see the political dimensions of Fanon's thought and that he should be read as a Marxist-oriented revolutionary.  Gordon points out that both scholars were committing acts of disciplinary decadence by, in effect, condemning other disciplines for not being theirs.  It was at the end of that book that the concept of disciplinary decadence was introduced.  He returned to the concept most recently in his book ''Disciplinary Decadence'' (2006).  Gordon's reputation in Fanon Studies grew through his co-edited anthology, ''Fanon: A Critical Reader'' (1996), and his many articles over the past decade on various dimensions of Fanon's thought.  In those works, he introduced what he calls \u201cfive stages of Fanon\u2019s studies,\u201d and he offers a variety of unique readings of Fanon's work.  He has shown connections between Du Bois and Fanon on double consciousness; he has written on how Fanon's critique of white normativity leads to the question of whether modern society has any notion of a normal black person; Fanon, he argues, seeks a coherent notion of how it is possible.\n\nGordon's writings have continued expansion of his and related philosophical approaches and lexicon.  In his book of social criticism, ''Her Majesty's Other Children: Sketches of Racism from a Neocolonial Age'' (1997), he explored problems in [[critical race theory]] and philosophy and introduced one of his most famous thought experiments.  In the chapter \"Sex, Race, and Matrices of Desire\", Gordon purports to have created a racial-gender-sex-sexuality matrix and used it to challenge our assumptions of the mixture.  A white woman in that matrix, for instance, is mixed because her whiteness makes her masculine but her womanness makes her black.  Or certain relationships are transformed, where same-sex interracial relationships are not necessarily homosexual or lesbian ones.  What is striking about the book is a theme that some of his critics noticed in his earlier books, and that is the role of music in his prose and analysis.  Gordon here builds on his argument about the everyday in his earlier work to argue that danger of most theories of social transformation is that they fail to take seriously the aesthetic dimensions of everyday life.  Moral and political thought and economy are good at constructing contexts in which people could sustain biological and social life, but they are terrible at articulating what it means to live in a livable world.  Gordon argues that a genuinely emancipatory society creates spaces for the ordinary celebration of everyday pleasure.  In his more recent work, Gordon has been arguing about the geography of reason and the importance of contingency in social life.  However, it needs to be noted that the legitimacy of his \"mixture-matrix\" is largely dependent upon his controversial applications of semiotics to race and gender.\n\n=== Reason and rationality ===\nA problem of Western thought, Gordon argues, is that it has yoked reason to instrumental rationality and created an antiblack notion of reason's geographical landscape.  Shifting the geography of reason, he argues, would entail a war on the kinds of decadence that treat any human community as incapable of manifesting reason.  But more, Gordon argues that reason is broader than rationality since it must be used to assess rationality.  Rationality could only attempt to impose consistency on reason, but the reason could point out that maximum consistency, although rational, may be unreasonable.  Gordon's recent work has been a development of these issues.  His co-edited books with Jane Anna Gordon, ''Not Only the Master's Tools: African-American Studies in Theory and Practice'' (2005) and ''A Companion to African-American Studies'' (2006), offer some important new concepts in the ongoing development of his thought.  In the first, he offers a comprehensive treatment of African-American philosophy and the importance of Africana existential phenomenological thought through a critique of [[Audre Lorde]]'s admonition of using the master's tools.  The two Gordons' response is that (1) tools should not only be used to tear down houses but also to build them up; (2) the master's tools are not the only tools available; and (3) the construction of alternative houses (theoretical models, philosophies) could decenter the value of the master's house, denuding it of mastery.  In his essay \"African-American Philosophy, Race, and Racism\", which is his main contribution in that volume, he provides a comprehensive and concise statement of his work to date.  In the introduction to the ''Companion'', he and Jane Gordon formulate a theory of African-American Studies as a form of double consciousness.  But the key here is the introduction of their concept \"the pedagogical imperative\".  This imperative refers to a teacher's duty to learn and keep learning the broadest and most accurate picture of reality available to humankind.  The editors also advance a theory of internationalism, localism, and market nihilism in the face of the rise of an independent managerial class to describe the dynamics of the contemporary academy.\n\n== Classification of Gordon's contributions to sociology and philosophy ==\nGordon considers all of his works to be part of a [[humanism|humanist]] tradition. The role of intellectuals, in his view, is to challenge the limits of human knowledge and, in so doing, achieve some advancement in what he calls \"the ''Geist'' war\".  For him, the importance of intellectual work could be summarized by his claim that one \"achieves\" as a human being for humanity but one always fails alone. Gordon's work has also been characterized as a form of existential [[sociology]]. The sociological dimensions of his writings have received much attention, and the readers of his most recent book, ''Disciplinary Decadence: Living Thought in Trying Times'' (2006), have described it as a work that is not only in philosophy (of disciplinarity) but also in education and the sociology of the formations of disciplines themselves.  Gordon, however, describes what he is attempting to do as a teleological suspension of disciplinarity.\n\n==Published works==\nGordon has produced approximately 100 articles, book chapters, and reviews.

He has written particularly extensively on race and racism, postcolonial phenomenology, Africana and [[black existentialism]], and on the works and thought of [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.

He completed his [[Master of Arts]] and [[Master of Philosophy]] degrees in philosophy in 1991 at [[Yale University]], and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree with distinction from the same university in 1993. Following the completion of his doctoral studies, Gordon taught at [[Brown University]], Yale, [[Purdue University]], and [[Temple University]], where he was the [[Laura H. Carnell]] Professor of Philosophy in the Department of Philosophy with affiliations in Religious and Judaic Studies. He is currently Professor of Philosophy and Africana Studies, with affiliations in Judaic Studies and the Caribbean, Latino/a, and Latin American Studies, at the [[University of Connecticut]] at [[Storrs, Connecticut|Storrs]]. He also is Visiting Euro philosophy Professor at [[Toulouse University]], France, and Nelson Mandela Visiting Professor in Political and International Studies at [[Rhodes University]] in South Africa (2014\u20132016).\n\nAt Temple, he was Director of the Institute for the Study of Race and Social Thought (ISRST), which is devoted to research on the complexity and social dimensions of race and racism.  The ISRST's many projects include developing a consortium on Afro-Latin American Studies, a Philadelphia Blues People Project, semiological studies of indigeneity, a Black Civil Society project, symposia on race, sexuality, and sexual health, and ongoing work in Africana philosophy.  Gordon was Executive Editor of volumes I-V of ''[[Radical Philosophy Review]]: Journal of the Radical Philosophy Association'' and co-editor of the [[Routledge]] book series on [[Africana philosophy]].  Additionally, he is President of the Caribbean Philosophical Association.\n\nGordon is the founder of the Center for [[African Jews|Afro-Jewish]] Studies, the only such research center, which focuses on developing and providing reliable sources of information on [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and African Diasporic Jewish or [[Hebrews|Hebrew]]-descended populations.  Gordon states: \"In actuality, there is no such thing as pure Jewish blood. Jews are a creolized [mixed-race] people. It's been that way since at least the time we left [[Egypt]] as a [culturally] mixed Egyptian and African [i.e., from other parts of Africa] people.\"\n\nGordon founded the Second Chance Program at [[Herbert H. Lehman High School|Lehman High School]] in the [[Bronx, New York]]. He is married to Jane Anna Gordon.\n\n== Philosophy and work in theory ==\n\n===Black existentialism===\nGordon is considered among the leading scholars in [[black existentialism]].<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 56| pages = 72\u201384| last1 = Linwood G.

The book is written in four parts, with a series of short chapters that at times take the form of phenomenological vignettes. Bad faith, as Gordon reads it, is a coextensive phenomenon reflective of the metastability of the human condition.  It is a denial of human reality, an effort to evade freedom, a flight from responsibility, a choice against choice, an assertion of being the only point of view on the world, an assertion of being the world, an effort to deny having a point of view, a flight from displeasing truths to pleasing falsehoods, a form of misanthropy, an act of believing what one does not believe, a form of spirit of seriousness, sincerity, an effort to disarm evidence (a Gordon innovation), a form of sedimented or institutional version of all of these, and (another Gordon innovation) a flight from and war against social reality.  Gordon rejects notions of disembodied [[consciousness]] (which he argues are forms of bad faith) and articulates a theory of the body-in-bad-faith.  Gordon also rejects authenticity discourses.  He sees them as trapped in expectations of sincerity, which also is a form of bad faith.  He proposes, instead, critical good faith, which he argues requires respect for evidence and accountability in the social world, a world of intersubjective relations.\n\n=== The question of racism ===\n[[Racism]], Gordon argues,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} requires the rejection of another human being's humanity.  Since the other human being is a human being, such a rejection is a contradiction of reality.  A racist must, then, deny reality, and since communication is possible between a racist and the people who are the object of racial hatred, then social reality is also what is denied in racist assertions.  A racist, then, attempts to avoid social reality.  Gordon argues that since people could only \"appear\" if embodied, then racism is an attack on embodied realities.  It is an effort to make embodied realities bodies without points of view or make points of views without bodies.   Racism is also a form of the spirit of seriousness, by which Gordon means the treatment of values as material features of the world instead of expressions of human freedom and responsibility.  Racism ascribes to so-called racially inferior people intrinsic values that emanate from their flesh.  A result of the spirit of seriousness is racist rationality.  Here, Gordon, in agreement with [[Frantz Fanon]], argues that racists are not irrational people but instead hyper-rational expressions of racist rationality.  He rejects, in other words, theories that regard racism as a function of bad emotions or passions.  Such phenomena, he suggests, emerge as a consequence of racist thinking, not its cause.  Effect emerges, in other words, to affect how one negotiates reality.  If one is not willing to deal with time, a highly emotional response squeezes all time into a single moment, which leads to the overflow of what one prefers to believe over what one is afraid of facing.\n\nGordon analyzes a variety of issues in the study of anti-black racism, such as black antiblack racists, exoticism, racial \u201cqualities,\u201d and theological-ethical dimensions of racism.  He prefers to focus on anti-black racism instead of \u201c[[white supremacy]]\u201d because, he points out, that anti-black racism could exist without white supremacy.  There are many people who reject white supremacy but affirm notions of black inferiority.  A prime example is that there are black antiblack racists.  Gordon analyzes this phenomenon through a discussion of black use of the word \u201c[[nigger]],\u201d which he argues is bad faith effort at black self-exceptionalism\u2014of, in the case of the user of the term, not being its object.  Exoticism is the other extreme.  It is a rejection of the humanity of black people under the pretense of loving black people.  The exoticist valorizes black people because he or she regards black people as, like animals, incapable of valid judgment.\n\n=== Theology and history-ethics ===\nGordon argues{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} that in theological form, studies of anti-black racism reveal that a particular assumption of [[Western world|Western]] [[ethical]] thought must be rejected \u2013 the notion of similarity as a condition of ethical obligation.  That black woman could worship a god with whom they are neither similar nor could ever be identical demonstrates that love does not require similarity.  Gordon argues that the ethical issue against anti-black racism is not one of seeing the similarity between blacks and whites but of being able, simply, to respect and see the ethical importance of blacks as blacks.  The fight against racism, in other words, does not require the elimination of race or noticing the racial difference but instead demands to respect the humanity of the people who exemplify racial difference.  In ''Existence in Black'', Gordon outlines themes of black existentialism in the text's introduction.  He argues that black existentialism addresses many of the same themes of European existentialism but with some key differences.  For instance, although both sets argue that the notion of a human being makes no sense outside of human communities and that individuals make no sense without society and societies make no sense without individuals, European existentialists had to defend individuality more because they were normative in their societies, whereas black existentialists had to focus on community more in order to demonstrate their membership in the human community.  The question of individuality for black existentialists becomes one of showing that not all black people are the same. Themes of anguish, dread, freedom, absurdity, and death are examined, as well, through the historical reality of anti-black racism and [[colonialism]] and, along with it, the meaning of black suffering and the legitimacy of black existence.  The logic of anti-black racism demands blacks offering justifications for their existence that are not posed for whites.\n\nGordon points{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} these dynamics out through discussions of [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois]]'s observation that black people are often treated as problems instead of people who face problems in the world and Frantz Fanon's call for black people to become actional through transcending the dialectics of seeking white recognition.  Gordon also argues that black existential philosophy is an area of thought, which means that contributions to its development can come from anyone who understands its problematics. In other words, one does not have to be black to contribute to this area of thought.  ''Existence in Black'' reflects his point since it has articles by other authors from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds discussing themes ranging from African and [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|Afro-Caribbean]] existential struggles with beliefs in predestination to black [[feminist]] struggles with postmodern anti-essentialist thought.  Gordon's chapter in the book focuses on the problem of black invisibility, which he points out is paradoxical since it is a function of black people being hyper-visible.  Gordon's place in this area of thought was solidified in 2000 with the publication of his book ''Existentia Africana: Understanding Africana Existential Thought''.  That book explores themes of existence\u2014which he points out, from its Latin etymology, means to stand out or to appear\u2014over the course of examining a set of new philosophical themes that emerge from their convergence with realities faced by African diasporic peoples.  Gordon argues that traditional philosophical questions are not the only ones that philosophers should look at.  Gordon examines, as a matter of philosophical interest, topics ranging from the stratification of blacks in biographical discourses to the difficulty of studying black people as human beings.  He rejects the notion that existential philosophy is incompatible with religious thought.  To support his position, he examines how religion poses not only unique questions of paths to be taken in struggles for liberation, but also of the conditions that make religious practices such as worship possible.  He ends that work with a reflection on writing, in which he advances his own commitment to transcendental philosophical approaches, those, in other words, that explore the conditions by which and through which certain phenomena are able to manifest themselves or become possible.  Crucial here is that Gordon does not pit existential philosophy against transcendental philosophy but, instead, argues for both.\n\n=== Phenomenology and colonialism ===\nGordon is also known{{By whom|date=February 2012}} as the founder of postcolonial [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the leading proponent of Africana phenomenology which has enabled him to make a mark in Fanon Studies.  Gordon was able to develop [[postcolonial]] phenomenology, which he sometimes refers to as Africana phenomenology or de-colonial phenomenology, through making a series of important innovations to [[Husserl]]ian and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartrian]] phenomenologies.  The first, and perhaps most important, is his transformation of parenthesizing and bracketing of the natural attitude into what he calls \"ontological suspension\". Although Husserl called for a suspension of the natural attitude, his goal was primarily [[epistemology|epistemological]].  Gordon's interest is, however, primarily concerned with errors that occur from inappropriate [[ontological]] assertions.  He is also concerned with metaphysics, which he, unlike many contemporary thinkers, does not reject.  Instead, he sees the continuation of [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] metaphysics, which advances a notion of substance that is governed by the essence that leads to the definition in the form of essential being, as a problem.  Gordon wants to talk about the social world and the meanings constructed by it without reducing it to a [[physicalism|physicalist]] ontology.  The notion of ontological suspension, which he claims is compatible with [[Husserl#The elaboration of phenomenology|Husserlian phenomenology]], advances this effort.  He also advances phenomenology as a form of radically self-reflective thought, which means that it must question even its methodological assumptions.  Because of this, it must resist epistemological colonization, and it is in this sense that phenomenology is itself postcolonial or decolonizing.  Because of this, Gordon refused for some time in his career to refer to his work as \u201cphilosophy,\u201d for that would mean colonizing it with a disciplinary set of assumptions.  He preferred to call his work \u201cradical thought,\u201d which for him meant being willing to go to the roots of reality in a critical way.  From these moves, Gordon was able to generate a set of theoretical concepts that have become useful to those who have adopted his theoretical lexicon: his unique formulation of crisis; his theory of [[epistemic closure]]; his theory of disciplinary decadence and teleological suspension of disciplinarity; and his analysis of maturation and tragedy.\n\nMost of these ideas first emerged in the work that gave Gordon a reputation in Fanon studies\u2014namely, ''Fanon and the Crisis of European Man: An Essay on Philosophy and the Human Sciences'' (1995).  Gordon introduced a new stage in Fanon studies by announcing that he was not interested in writing on Fanon but instead working with Fanon on the advancement of his (Gordon's) own intellectual project.  Fanon was thus an occasion or point of departure but not the main object of the study.  The work is, then, a statement more of Gordon's philosophy than that of Fanon, who, in this text, is more a major influence.  The book offers several innovations to the question of colonialism and the human sciences.  First, Gordon argues that crises are really human communities refusing to make the choices necessary for the transformation of realities created by human agency.  In short, they are forms of choices against choice or choosing not to choose, which amounts to bad faith.  History, he argued, must transcend the imposition of world history (and thus become structured as a crisis) and move toward an existential-historical understanding of human communities on the basis of critical good faith.  Phenomena such as racism and colonialism, because they attempt to erase the humanity of the colonized and object of racism, place challenges on whether it is possible to study human communities without collapsing into acts of discursive, imperial practices.\n\nGordon has also made an important contribution to the understanding around the work of [[Steve Biko]] by way of a new introduction to Biko's classic text ''[[I Write What I Like]]''.<ref>[http://abahlali.org/node/3039 New Introduction by Lewis Gordon] to Steve Biko's ''I Write What I Like''.</ref>\n\n=== Essentialism and race ===\nFor some scholars,{{who|date=February 2012}} [[essentialism]] means that one cannot study race and racism and colonialism properly because of they, in effect, lack essences.  Gordon argues that although human beings are incomplete, are without laws of nature, it does not follow that they cannot be studied and understood with reasonable accuracy.  Drawing upon the thought of [[Max Weber]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Alfred Schutz]], and [[Frantz Fanon]], Gordon argued that the task is to develop accurate portrayals or to thematize everyday life.  He argues that racism and colonialism are everyday phenomena and, as such, are lived as \"normal\" aspects of modern life.   Even under severe conditions, human beings find ways to live as though under ordinary conditions.  This ordinariness can get to a point of distorting reality.  In the case of racism, one group of people are allowed to live an ordinary life under ordinary conditions while another group or other groups are expected to do so under extraordinary conditions.  Institutional bad faith renders those extraordinary conditions invisible and advances as a norm the false notion a shared ordinary set of conditions.  This is the meaning behind the colloquial notion of \"double standards\".  Gordon here also advances a theory that provides an answer to [[social constructivism|social constructivists]] in the study of race.  What they fail to understand, Gordon argues, is that sociality is also constructed, which makes social constructivism redundant.\n\nMany social constructivists{{who|date=February 2012}} also treat the identification of constructive as the conclusion of the argument instead of its beginning. For Gordon, identifying that something is constructed does not mean showing that the phenomenon is false or fictional.  Human beings construct many \"real\" things, such as language and meaning and the forms of life generated by such activities and concepts.  Many people are able, for instance, to act on race concepts (not racist ones) with a fair degree of accuracy.  What this means is simply that they know how to read the social world and the bodies through which that world is manifested.  The error that many critics make is that they demand the false criterion of universality and infallibility to the practice of racial identification.  Gordon argues that such a demand would not work for the identification of most social phenomena.  What is required is not universality nor infallibility but generality.  Gordon defends this claim by making the distinction between a law and a principle.  Law is absolute, without exceptions, categorical.  A principle is general and has exceptions.  For things human, principles are more appropriate ascriptions than laws.  Gordon argues that these ideas emerged through his reading of Fanon's notions of sociogenesis.\n\nOther ideas he borrows from Fanon are his rejection of the dialectics of recognition and his unique view on racism's impact on ethics and the concept of the Other.  Like Fanon, Gordon argues that to seek white recognition leads to dependency on whites.  It also means to make whites the standard of value.  Yet Gordon rejects the thesis that racism is about a Self\u2013Other dialectic.  Antiblack racists do not see blacks as the Other or others, in Gordon's view.  Such relations only exist between whites and whomever else they see as human beings or genuine others.  Thus, the struggle against anti-black racism is ironically for blacks to become others.  This displacement of otherness means that the fight against racism is governed not by moral laws but by tragic ones in which innocence becomes irrelevant.  Gordon concludes the work with a look at how two scholars read Fanon's importance: [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], argued that only Fanon's biography is of any contemporary interest, and that is as good literature.  [[Cedric Robinson]] argued that Gates failed to see the political dimensions of Fanon's thought and that he should be read as a Marxist-oriented revolutionary.  Gordon points out that both scholars were committing acts of disciplinary decadence by, in effect, condemning other disciplines for not being theirs.  It was at the end of that book that the concept of disciplinary decadence was introduced.  He returned to the concept most recently in his book ''Disciplinary Decadence'' (2006).  Gordon's reputation in Fanon Studies grew through his co-edited anthology, ''Fanon: A Critical Reader'' (1996), and his many articles over the past decade on various dimensions of Fanon's thought.  In those works, he introduced what he calls \u201cfive stages of Fanon\u2019s studies,\u201d and he offers a variety of unique readings of Fanon's work.  He has shown connections between Du Bois and Fanon on double consciousness; he has written on how Fanon's critique of white normativity leads to the question of whether modern society has any notion of a normal black person; Fanon, he argues, seeks a coherent notion of how it is possible.\n\nGordon's writings have continued expansion of his and related philosophical approaches and lexicon.  In his book of social criticism, ''Her Majesty's Other Children: Sketches of Racism from a Neocolonial Age'' (1997), he explored problems in [[critical race theory]] and philosophy and introduced one of his most famous thought experiments.  In the chapter \"Sex, Race, and Matrices of Desire\", Gordon purports to have created a racial-gender-sex-sexuality matrix and used it to challenge our assumptions of the mixture.  A white woman in that matrix, for instance, is mixed because her whiteness makes her masculine but her womanness makes her black.  Or certain relationships are transformed, where same-sex interracial relationships are not necessarily homosexual or lesbian ones.  What is striking about the book is a theme that some of his critics noticed in his earlier books, and that is the role of music in his prose and analysis.  Gordon here builds on his argument about the everyday in his earlier work to argue that danger of most theories of social transformation is that they fail to take seriously the aesthetic dimensions of everyday life.  Moral and political thought and economy are good at constructing contexts in which people could sustain biological and social life, but they are terrible at articulating what it means to live in a livable world.  Gordon argues that a genuinely emancipatory society creates spaces for the ordinary celebration of everyday pleasure.  In his more recent work, Gordon has been arguing about the geography of reason and the importance of contingency in social life.  However, it needs to be noted that the legitimacy of his \"mixture-matrix\" is largely dependent upon his controversial applications of semiotics to race and gender.\n\n=== Reason and rationality ===\nA problem of Western thought, Gordon argues, is that it has yoked reason to instrumental rationality and created an antiblack notion of reason's geographical landscape.  Shifting the geography of reason, he argues, would entail a war on the kinds of decadence that treat any human community as incapable of manifesting reason.  But more, Gordon argues that reason is broader than rationality since it must be used to assess rationality.  Rationality could only attempt to impose consistency on reason, but the reason could point out that maximum consistency, although rational, may be unreasonable.  Gordon's recent work has been a development of these issues.  His co-edited books with Jane Anna Gordon, ''Not Only the Master's Tools: African-American Studies in Theory and Practice'' (2005) and ''A Companion to African-American Studies'' (2006), offer some important new concepts in the ongoing development of his thought.  In the first, he offers a comprehensive treatment of African-American philosophy and the importance of Africana existential phenomenological thought through a critique of [[Audre Lorde]]'s admonition of using the master's tools.  The two Gordons' response is that (1) tools should not only be used to tear down houses but also to build them up; (2) the master's tools are not the only tools available; and (3) the construction of alternative houses (theoretical models, philosophies) could decenter the value of the master's house, denuding it of mastery.  In his essay \"African-American Philosophy, Race, and Racism\", which is his main contribution in that volume, he provides a comprehensive and concise statement of his work to date.  In the introduction to the ''Companion'', he and Jane Gordon formulate a theory of African-American Studies as a form of double consciousness.  But the key here is the introduction of their concept \"the pedagogical imperative\".  This imperative refers to a teacher's duty to learn and keep learning the broadest and most accurate picture of reality available to humankind.  The editors also advance a theory of internationalism, localism, and market nihilism in the face of the rise of an independent managerial class to describe the dynamics of the contemporary academy.\n\n== Classification of Gordon's contributions to sociology and philosophy ==\nGordon considers all of his works to be part of a [[humanism|humanist]] tradition. The role of intellectuals, in his view, is to challenge the limits of human knowledge and, in so doing, achieve some advancement in what he calls \"the ''Geist'' war\".  For him, the importance of intellectual work could be summarized by his claim that one \"achieves\" as a human being for humanity but one always fails alone. Gordon's work has also been characterized as a form of existential [[sociology]]. The sociological dimensions of his writings have received much attention, and the readers of his most recent book, ''Disciplinary Decadence: Living Thought in Trying Times'' (2006), have described it as a work that is not only in philosophy (of disciplinarity) but also in education and the sociology of the formations of disciplines themselves.  Gordon, however, describes what he is attempting to do as a teleological suspension of disciplinarity.\n\n==Published works==\nGordon has produced approximately 100 articles, book chapters, and reviews.  Books by Gordon currently in print are:\n\n*''What Fanon Said: A Philosophical Introduction to his Life and Thought'' (Fordham University Press, 2015)\n* with Jane Anna Gordon, ''Of Divine Warning: Reading Disaster in the Modern Age'' (Paradigm Publishers, 2009)\n*''An Introduction to Africana Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008)\n*''Disciplinary Decadence: Living Thought in Trying Times'' (Paradigm Publishers, 2006)\n*''A Companion to African American Studies'' (ed. with Jane Anna Gordon) (Blackwell, 2006)\n*''Not Only the Master's Tools: African-American Studies in Theory and Practice'' (ed. with Jane Anna Gordon) (Paradigm Publishers, 2005)\n*''Existentia Africana: Understanding Africana Existential Thought'' (Routledge, 2000)\n*''Her Majesty\u2019s Other Children: Sketches of Racism from a Neocolonial Age'' (Rowman & Littlefield, 1997).
