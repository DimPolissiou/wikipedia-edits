He was a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], the [[List of Governors of Missouri|20th]] [[Governor of Missouri]], and the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] candidate in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1872|presidential election of 1872]].\n\nBorn in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], Brown established a legal practice in [[St. Louis]], Missouri. Both of his grandfathers, [[John Brown (Kentucky)|John Brown]] and [[Jesse Bledsoe]], represented Kentucky in the Senate. After settling in St. Louis, Brown won election to the [[Missouri House of Representatives]]. He became an ally of [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]] and [[Francis Preston Blair Jr.]] in the struggle for control of the state Democratic Party against pro-slavery forces. As the 1850s progressed, Brown continued to speak against [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], and he helped found the Missouri [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Brown worked to keep Missouri in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. In 1863, he was elected to the Senate as a member of the [[Unconditional Union Party]]. In the Senate, he aligned with the [[Radical Republican]]s and opposed many of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s policies. He was part of a movement that unsuccessfully sought to replace Lincoln as the 1864 Republican nominee. After the war, Brown strongly opposed President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] policies and supported the [[Freedmen's Bureau bills]].\n\nBrown resigned from the Senate in 1867 but helped found the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]] in 1870. The party chose Brown as its nominee for governor, and he defeated incumbent Republican Governor [[Joseph W. McClurg]]. Brown sought the new party's 1872 presidential nomination but was defeated by [[Horace Greeley]]. After the nomination of Greeley, the [[1872 Liberal Republican convention]] chose Brown as the party's vice presidential nominee. Seeking to avoid splitting the vote of opponents to President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s re-election, the [[1872 Democratic National Convention]] subsequently nominated the Liberal Republican ticket. The Republican ticket nonetheless triumphed in the election, as Grant won 55.6% of the popular vote and a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]. Greeley died after the election but before the electors officially cast their votes, and Brown received some of Greeley's electoral votes. After the election, Gratz returned to his law practice and affiliated with the Democratic Party.\n\n==Early life==\nBrown was born in 1826 in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], the son of Judith Ann (Bledsoe) and [[Mason Brown]]. He was the grandson of Senators [[John Brown (Kentucky)|John Brown]] and [[Jesse Bledsoe]] of Kentucky.  He graduated from [[Transylvania University]] in Lexington in 1845 where he was a member of [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity, and from [[Yale College]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], in 1847. He studied law, and later settled in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. There he joined his cousin, [[Francis P. Blair, Jr.]], and Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] in a struggle against the pro-[[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] faction for control of Missouri's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. He was a correspondent for the Missouri Republican at the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)]] and served as the secretary at the treaty negotiations.<ref>Lowe, Percival (1906) Five Years a Dragoon ('49 to '54).

An able lawyer in St. Louis, Brown made a speech in 1857 against a joint resolution opposing emancipation. The speech marked the beginning of the [[Free Soil]] movement in Missouri. He was a leader of the movement. After that, he edited the ''[[St. Louis Democrat|Missouri Democrat]]'' between 1854 and 1859. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Missouri in 1857.\n\nOn August 26, 1856 he fought a [[duel]] on [[Bloody Island (Mississippi River)]] with [[Thomas C. Reynolds]] (then the St. Louis District Attorney) over the slavery issue.  Reynolds was not hurt but Brown was shot in the leg and limped for the rest of his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/education/dueling/political-duels.asp|title=Crack of the Pistol Political Duels|website=www.sos.mo.gov|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nBrown became a founding member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in Missouri. Throughout the 1860s, he and Blair contested control of the state's Republican party. He worked to prevent Missouri from [[secession|seceding]] from the Union in 1861. After that, he served as an officer in the [[Union Army]] during the first half of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], raising a regiment (the 4th U.S. Reserves) and serving as its [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. He recruited over 1,100 soldiers for his regiment, many of which were St. Louis-area [[German-Americans in the Civil War|German-Americans]], a key constituency that Brown courted for his political advantage.\n\nBrown resigned from the Army after he was elected in late 1863 as an [[Unconditional Union Party|Unconditional Unionist]] to the [[U.S. Senate]] to fill the vacancy caused by the expulsion of [[Waldo P. Johnson]]. Brown opposed [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s moderation and objected to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] because it did not free slaves in Missouri and other loyal border states. He was a key figure in the move to replace Lincoln with [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] in the [[1864 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1864]]. In the Senate, Brown was chairman of the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds|Public Buildings and Grounds committee]] and of the [[United States Senate Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses of the Senate|Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense]]. Following Lincoln's assassination, Brown was vehemently opposed to new President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s moderate plan of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. He also supported the Radical-sponsored Civil Rights Bill and Freedmen's Bureau Bill. Brown left the Senate in 1867 because of ill health.\n\nIn 1870, dissatisfied with the Missouri Republicans, he joined the new [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]]. The party nominated Brown for governor, and he defeated Republican incumbent [[Joseph W. McClurg]]. Brown served as the Governor between 1871 and 1873.\n\n==Presidential election of 1872==\n[[File:Greeley-Brown-1872.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Greeley/Brown campaign poster]]\nBrown was one of the contenders for the Liberal Republican presidential nomination, but lost to newspaper editor [[Horace Greeley]]. Brown was the vice presidential candidate under Greeley in the [[1872 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1872]] for the Liberal Republican and Democratic parties. Greeley died on November 29 of illness, before the [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] could vote, and the electoral votes (63 of 66) that were to have been for Greeley were split among four others, including Brown, who received eighteen of those electoral votes. The Republicans, incumbent [[President of the United States|president]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and the vice presidential candidate, U.S. Senator [[Henry Wilson]] of [[Massachusetts]], won the election anyway.\n\nBrown returned to his law practice, quit the Republican Party and resumed his ties to the Democrats. He died in [[Kirkwood, Missouri]] and is interred there at Oak Hill Cemetery.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{CongBio|B000905}} Retrieved on 2009-03-30\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Benjamin Gratz Brown}}\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [http://www.bookrags.com/biography/benjamin-gratz-brown/ Brown biography]\n*{{Find a Grave|18514|accessdate=2009-03-30}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-sen}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Robert Wilson (Missouri)|Robert Wilson]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of United States Senators from Missouri|U.S. Senator (Class 3) from Missouri]]|years=1863\u20131867|alongside=[[John B.
