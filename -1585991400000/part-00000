[[BHP|BHP Biliton]] was the owner of the mine when it was opened, but they wanted to close the mine as a consequence of major environmental damage due to negligence. The Government was faced with a great loss of revenue and a formula was found to continue mining. BHP transferred its shares to a trust fund for the local community, and BHP was in return granted immunity from claims because of environmental damages, while BHP continued to manage the mine. O\u2019Neill considered that a mistake and revoked the immunity. One concern was that proceeds from the mine were disappearing abroad instead of staying within PNG. This is connected to a political rivalry with former Prime Minister Sir [[Mekere Morauta]], whose political base is in that part of the country. Morauta, as chairman of PNGSDF, challenged the nationalisation without compensation and refused access to the externalised PNGSDF in Singapore which is meant as a Social Wealth Fund for when the mine is exhausted. The case is continuing in the Singaporean courts.

[[BHP|BHP Biliton]] was the owner of the mine when it was opened, but they wanted to close the mine as a consequence of major environmental damage due to negligence. The Government was faced with a great loss of revenue and a formula was found to continue mining. BHP transferred its shares to a trust fund for the local community, and BHP was in return granted immunity from claims because of environmental damages, while BHP continued to manage the mine. O\u2019Neill considered that a mistake and revoked the immunity. One concern was that proceeds from the mine were disappearing abroad instead of staying within PNG. This is connected to a political rivalry with former Prime Minister Sir [[Mekere Morauta]], whose political base is in that part of the country. Morauta, as chairman of PNGSDF, challenged the nationalisation without compensation and refused access to the externalised PNGSDF in Singapore which is meant as a Social Wealth Fund for when the mine is exhausted. The case is continuing in the Singaporean courts. The government has gained the right to inspect the books of PNGSDP as it is a shareholder, but the issue of ownership is still undecided.<ref>Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd [2016] SGHC 19 Originating Summons No 234 of 2015 Date of judgement: 12 February 2016 Judge: Judith Prakash Available at: http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/high-court-judgments/18364-independent-state-of-papua-new-guinea-v-png-sustainable-development-program-ltd Accessed: 10/11/2017</ref> An arbitration attempt in Singapore failed as there was no written consent to arbitration from the PNG government.<ref>Marquita Davis: Unanimous ICSID tribunal dismisses expropriation claim due to Papua New Guinea\u2019s lack of written consent to arbitrate PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v.

This facility would include \"SkySuites\", small individual compartments with sliding doors or curtains, featuring beds, seating, and entertainment or business equipment. A common [[wikt:Lounge|lounge]] area could also be provided. Boeing also proposed smaller, more modest \"SkyBunks\".

Passengers using the SkySuites, sold at a premium price, would sit in regular [[economy class]] seats for take-off and landing, and move to the crown area during flight. However, pricing feasibility studies found the SkyLoft concept difficult to justify. In 2007, Boeing dropped the SkyLoft concept in favor of upper-deck galley storage options, which were favored by the airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/04/17/213230/space-race-the-battle-between-airbus-and-boeing-to-produce-the-best-next-generation.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714214906/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/04/17/213230/space-race-the-battle-between-airbus-and-boeing-to-produce-the-best-next-generation.html |archivedate=2007-07-14 |title=Space race: next-generation cabins |last=Kingsley-Jones |first=Max |author2=Guy Norris |date=April 17, 2007 |publisher=Flight International |accessdate=April 19, 2007}}</ref> Outfitting the crown space for sleeping remains an option on [[Very Important Person|VIP]] aircraft,<ref>Ostrower, Jon.

In 2010, Deveraux Eyler published her memoir to tell her story as a stolen baby, victim of Georgia Tann. Devereaux \"Devy\" Bruch Eyler grew up knowing she was adopted. But she didn't know, until she was in her 70s, that she had been stolen from her birth mother, who had been told she was dead.  Devy met her sister, Patricia Ann Wilks of Germantown, TN for the first time in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Alexa Spencer |title='My mother was told I died': Stolen Georgia Tann baby, now 81, to share her story in Collierville |url=https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/local/suburbs/collierville/2019/10/24/georgia-tann-baby-victim-memphis-collierville-book-talk-devy-bruch-eyler/4073505002/ |website=Memphis Commercial Appeal |accessdate=10 December 2019 |date=October 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe scandal is also the subject of the novel:\n* ''Before We Were Yours, Lisa Wingate'' (2017) {{ISBN|0425284689}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Child laundering]]\n* [[Child-selling]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Barbara Raymond.

While ''RCGS Resolute'' sustained minor damages, not affecting vessel's seaworthiness, the navy vessel suffered severe damage while making contact with the [[ice class|ice-strengthened]] [[bulbous bow]] of the expedition cruise vessel ''RCGS Resolute'' and started to take water.<ref name=jpost20200403>{{cite news |url=https://www.jpost.com/International/Venezuelan-warship-shoots-rams-into-German-cruise-vessel-before-sinking-623422 |title=Venezuelan warship shoots, rams into German cruise vessel before sinking |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=3 April 2020 |access-date=3 April 2020 }}</ref> Ultimately ''Naiguat\u00e1'' sank, leaving the 44 naval personnel to be rescued by another vessel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fleetmon.com/maritime-news/2020/29297/cruise-ship-sunk-venezuelan-navy-ship-and-fled-pro/?fbclid=|title=Cruise Ship Sunk Venezuelan Navy Ship after being Fired at and Rammed.
