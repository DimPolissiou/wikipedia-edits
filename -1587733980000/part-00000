She is known to have written a commentary on [[Diophantus]]'s thirteen-volume ''[[Arithmetica]]'', which may survive in part, having been interpolated into Diophantus's original text, and another commentary on [[Apollonius of Perga]]'s treatise on [[conic sections]], which has not survived. Many modern scholars also believe that Hypatia may have edited the surviving text of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', based on the title of her father [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]]'s commentary on Book III of the ''Almagest''.\n\nHypatia is known to have constructed [[astrolabe]]s and [[hydrometer]]s, but did not invent either of these, which were both in use long before she was born. Although she herself was a [[Hellenistic religion|pagan]], she was tolerant towards [[Early Christianity|Christians]] and taught many Christian students, including [[Synesius]], the future bishop of [[Ptolemais, Cyrenaica|Ptolemais]]. Ancient sources record that Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and Christians alike and that she established great influence with the political elite in Alexandria. Shortly before she was murdered, Hypatia advised [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]], the [[List of governors of Roman Egypt|Roman prefect of Alexandria]], who was in the midst of a political feud with [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], the [[Patriarch of Alexandria|bishop of Alexandria]]. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians led by a [[Reader (liturgy)|lector]] named Peter.<ref>Edward Jay Watts, (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0j94OFipg2MC ''City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria''. \"Hypatia and pagan philosophical culture in the later fourth century\"], pp. 197\u2013198. University of California Press</ref>{{sfn|Deakin|1994|page=147}}\n\nHypatia's murder shocked the empire and transformed her into a \"[[martyr]] for philosophy\", leading future Neoplatonists such as [[Damascius]] to become increasingly fervent in their [[Criticism of Christianity|opposition to Christianity]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], Hypatia was co-opted as a symbol of [[Theological virtues|Christian virtue]] and scholars believe she was part of the basis for the legend of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]]. During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], she became a symbol of opposition to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. In the nineteenth century, European literature, especially [[Charles Kingsley]]'s 1853 novel ''[[Hypatia (novel)|Hypatia]]'', romanticized her as \"the last of the [[Greeks#Names|Hellenes]]\". In the twentieth century, Hypatia became seen as an icon for [[women's rights]] and a precursor to the [[feminist movement]]. Since the late twentieth century, some portrayals have associated Hypatia's death with the destruction of the [[Library of Alexandria]], despite the historical fact that the library no longer existed during Hypatia's lifetime.{{sfn|Theodore|2016|pages=182\u2013183}}\n\n== Life ==\n===Upbringing===\n[[File:Euclid Vat ms no 190 I prop 47.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Hypatia's father [[Theon of Alexandria]] is best known for having edited the existing text of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'',{{sfn|Deakin|2007|page=107}}{{sfn|Bradley|2006|page=60}}{{sfn|Booth|2017|page=112}} shown here in a ninth century manuscript]]\n\nHypatia was the daughter of the mathematician [[Theon of Alexandria]] (c. 335 \u2013 c. 405 AD).<ref name=\"Ockham\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/ockhamsrazor/hypatia-of-alexandria/3565116|title=Ockham's Razor: Hypatia of Alexandria|accessdate=10 July 2014|publisher=ABC Radio|date=3 August 1997|first=Michael|last=Deakin|authorlink=Michael A.

Instead, her death and the subsequent failure by the Christian government to impose justice on her killers destroyed that notion entirely and led future Neoplatonists such as Damascius to consider Christian bishops as \"dangerous, jealous figures who were also utterly unphilosophical.\"{{sfn|Watts|2017|page=119}} Hypatia became seen as a \"martyr for philosophy\",{{sfn|Watts|2017|page=119}} and her murder led philosophers to adopt attitudes that increasingly emphasized the pagan aspects of their beliefs system{{sfn|Watts|2017|pages=119\u2013120}} and helped create a sense of identity for philosophers as pagan traditionalists set apart from the Christian masses.{{sfn|Watts|2017|page=120}} Thus, while Hypatia's death did not bring an end to Neoplatonist philosophy as a whole, Watts argues that it did bring an end to her particular variety of it.{{sfn|Watts|2017|page=155}}\n\nShortly after Hypatia's murder, a [[forgery|forged]] anti-Christian letter appeared under her name.<ref>Synodicon, c. 216, in iv. tom.

[[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher, astronomer, and [[mathematician]], who lived in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], then part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. She was a prominent thinker of the Neoplatonic school in Alexandria where she taught [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]].<ref>Krebs, ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries''; ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999: \"Greek Neoplatonist philosopher who lived and taught in Alexandria.\"</ref> She is the first [[List of women in mathematics|female mathematician]] whose life is reasonably well recorded.{{sfn|Deakin|2012}} Hypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor. She is known to have written a commentary on [[Diophantus]]'s thirteen-volume ''[[Arithmetica]]'', which may survive in part, having been interpolated into Diophantus's original text, and another commentary on [[Apollonius of Perga]]'s treatise on [[conic sections]], which has not survived. Many modern scholars also believe that Hypatia may have edited the surviving text of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', based on the title of her father [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]]'s commentary on Book III of the ''Almagest''.\n\nHypatia is known to have constructed [[astrolabe]]s and [[hydrometer]]s, but did not invent either of these, which were both in use long before she was born. Although she herself was a [[Hellenistic religion|pagan]], she was tolerant towards [[Early Christianity|Christians]] and taught many Christian students, including [[Synesius]], the future bishop of [[Ptolemais, Cyrenaica|Ptolemais]]. Ancient sources record that Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and Christians alike and that she established great influence with the political elite in Alexandria. Shortly before she was murdered, Hypatia advised [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]], the [[List of governors of Roman Egypt|Roman prefect of Alexandria]], who was in the midst of a political feud with [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], the [[Patriarch of Alexandria|bishop of Alexandria]]. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians led by a [[Reader (liturgy)|lector]] named Peter.<ref>Edward Jay Watts, (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0j94OFipg2MC ''City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria''. \"Hypatia and pagan philosophical culture in the later fourth century\"], pp. 197\u2013198. University of California Press</ref>{{sfn|Deakin|1994|page=147}}\n\nHypatia's murder shocked the empire and transformed her into a \"[[martyr]] for philosophy\", leading future Neoplatonists such as [[Damascius]] to become increasingly fervent in their [[Criticism of Christianity|opposition to Christianity]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], Hypatia was co-opted as a symbol of [[Theological virtues|Christian virtue]] and scholars believe she was part of the basis for the legend of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]]. During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], she became a symbol of opposition to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. In the nineteenth century, European literature, especially [[Charles Kingsley]]'s 1853 novel ''[[Hypatia (novel)|Hypatia]]'', romanticized her as \"the last of the [[Greeks#Names|Hellenes]]\". In the twentieth century, Hypatia became seen as an icon for [[women's rights]] and a precursor to the [[feminist movement]]. Since the late twentieth century, some portrayals have associated Hypatia's death with the destruction of the [[Library of Alexandria]], despite the historical fact that the library no longer existed during Hypatia's lifetime.{{sfn|Theodore|2016|pages=182\u2013183}}\n\n== Life ==\n===Upbringing===\n[[File:Euclid Vat ms no 190 I prop 47.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Hypatia's father [[Theon of Alexandria]] is best known for having edited the existing text of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'',{{sfn|Deakin|2007|page=107}}{{sfn|Bradley|2006|page=60}}{{sfn|Booth|2017|page=112}} shown here in a ninth century manuscript]]\n\nHypatia was the daughter of the mathematician [[Theon of Alexandria]] (c. 335 \u2013 c. 405 AD).<ref name=\"Ockham\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/ockhamsrazor/hypatia-of-alexandria/3565116|title=Ockham's Razor: Hypatia of Alexandria|accessdate=10 July 2014|publisher=ABC Radio|date=3 August 1997|first=Michael|last=Deakin|authorlink=Michael A.

According to a description of Hypatia from the lost work ''Life of Isidore'' by the Neoplatonist historian [[Damascius]] (c. 458 \u2013 c. 538), preserved in the entry for her in the ''[[Suda]]'', a tenth-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] encyclopedia, Hypatia flourished during the reign of [[Arcadius]]. Hoche reasoned that Damascius's description of her physical beauty would imply that she was at most 30 at that time, and the year 370 was 30 years prior to the midpoint of Arcadius's reign.{{sfn|Penella|1984|pages=126\u2013128}}{{sfn|Hoche|1860|pages=435\u2013474}} In contrast, theories that she was born as early as 350 are based on the wording of the chronicler [[John Malalas]] (c.\u2009491 \u2013 578), who calls her old at the time of her death in 415.{{sfn|Dzielska|1996|page=68}}<ref>J.

Notable female Neoplatonists who followed her include: [[Aedesia]], [[Asclepigenia]], and [[Theodora of Emesa]], all of whom lived out similar careers.{{sfn|Booth|2017|page=151}}\n\nAccording to Watts, however, Hypatia had no appointed successor, no spouse, and no offspring{{sfn|Watts|2017|page=117}}{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=201}} and her sudden death not only left her legacy unprotected, but also triggered a backlash against her entire ideology.{{sfn|Watts|2017|pages=117\u2013119}} Hypatia, with her tolerance towards Christian students and her willingness to cooperate with Christian leaders, had hoped to establish a precedent that Neoplatonism and Christianity could coexist peacefully and cooperatively. Instead, her death and the subsequent failure by the Christian government to impose justice on her killers destroyed that notion entirely and led future Neoplatonists such as Damascius to consider Christian bishops as \"dangerous, jealous figures who were also utterly unphilosophical.\"{{sfn|Watts|2017|page=119}} Hypatia became seen as a \"martyr for philosophy\",{{sfn|Watts|2017|page=119}} and her murder led philosophers to adopt attitudes that increasingly emphasized the pagan aspects of their beliefs system{{sfn|Watts|2017|pages=119\u2013120}} and helped create a sense of identity for philosophers as pagan traditionalists set apart from the Christian masses.{{sfn|Watts|2017|page=120}} Thus, while Hypatia's death did not bring an end to Neoplatonist philosophy as a whole, Watts argues that it did bring an end to her particular variety of it.{{sfn|Watts|2017|page=155}}\n\nShortly after Hypatia's murder, a [[forgery|forged]] anti-Christian letter appeared under her name.<ref>Synodicon, c. 216, in iv. tom.

By 1994, it had become clear that Hekmatyar would never achieve this, and that his extremism had antagonised most Pashtuns, so the Pakistanis began turning towards the predominantly Pashtun [[Taliban]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rashid|first=Ahmed|authorlink=Ahmed Rashid|title=Taliban: Militant islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia|year=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]|isbn=978-0-300-08902-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/talibanmilitant000rash/page/26 26\u201327]|url=https://archive.org/details/talibanmilitant000rash/page/26}}</ref> After capturing Kandahar in November 1994, the Taliban made rapid progress towards Kabul, making inroads into Hezb-i Islami positions. They captured [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]] on 2 February 1995, and moved on to [[Maidan Shahr]] on 10 February and Mohammed Agha the next day. Very soon, Hekmatyar found himself caught between the advancing Taliban and the government forces, and the morale of his men collapsed.<ref>Rashid, ''Taliban'', p. 34</ref> On 14 February, he was forced to abandon his headquarters at Charasiab, from where rockets were fired at Kabul, and flee in disorder to [[Surobi, Kabul|Surobi]].<ref>Maley, ''The Afghanistan Wars'', p. 204</ref>\n\nNonetheless, in May 1996, Rabbani and Hekmatyar finally formed a power-sharing government in which Hekmatyar was made prime minister. Rabbani was anxious to enhance the legitimacy of his government by enlisting the support of Pashtun leaders. However, the Mahipar agreement did not bring any such benefits to him as Hekmatyar had little grassroots support, but did have many adverse effects: it caused outrage among Jamiat supporters, and among the population of Kabul, who had endured Hekmatyar's attacks for the last four years. Moreover, the agreement was clearly not what the Pakistanis wanted, and convinced them of Hekmatyar's weakness, and that they should shift their aid entirely over to the Taliban. Hekmatyar took office on 26 June, and immediately started issuing severe decrees on women's dress, that struck a sharp contrast with the relatively liberal policy that Massoud had followed until then. The Taliban responded to the agreement with a further spate of rocket attacks on the capital.<ref>Maley, ''The Afghanistan Wars'', pp. 215\u2013216</ref> The Rabbani/Hekmatyar regime lasted only a few months before the Taliban took control of Kabul in September 1996.

However the new alliance did not spell victory for Hekmatyar, and in June 1994, Massoud had driven Dostum's troops from the capital.<ref>Maley, ''The Afghanistan Wars'', p.203</ref>\n\n==Relations with the Taliban==\n{{further|Civil war in Afghanistan (1996\u20132001)}}\nThe Pakistani military had supported Hekmatyar until then in the hope of installing a Pashtun-dominated government in Kabul, which would be friendly to their interests. By 1994, it had become clear that Hekmatyar would never achieve this, and that his extremism had antagonised most Pashtuns, so the Pakistanis began turning towards the predominantly Pashtun [[Taliban]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rashid|first=Ahmed|authorlink=Ahmed Rashid|title=Taliban: Militant islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia|year=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]|isbn=978-0-300-08902-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/talibanmilitant000rash/page/26 26\u201327]|url=https://archive.org/details/talibanmilitant000rash/page/26}}</ref> After capturing Kandahar in November 1994, the Taliban made rapid progress towards Kabul, making inroads into Hezb-i Islami positions. They captured [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]] on 2 February 1995, and moved on to [[Maidan Shahr]] on 10 February and Mohammed Agha the next day. Very soon, Hekmatyar found himself caught between the advancing Taliban and the government forces, and the morale of his men collapsed.<ref>Rashid, ''Taliban'', p. 34</ref> On 14 February, he was forced to abandon his headquarters at Charasiab, from where rockets were fired at Kabul, and flee in disorder to [[Surobi, Kabul|Surobi]].<ref>Maley, ''The Afghanistan Wars'', p. 204</ref>\n\nNonetheless, in May 1996, Rabbani and Hekmatyar finally formed a power-sharing government in which Hekmatyar was made prime minister. Rabbani was anxious to enhance the legitimacy of his government by enlisting the support of Pashtun leaders. However, the Mahipar agreement did not bring any such benefits to him as Hekmatyar had little grassroots support, but did have many adverse effects: it caused outrage among Jamiat supporters, and among the population of Kabul, who had endured Hekmatyar's attacks for the last four years. Moreover, the agreement was clearly not what the Pakistanis wanted, and convinced them of Hekmatyar's weakness, and that they should shift their aid entirely over to the Taliban. Hekmatyar took office on 26 June, and immediately started issuing severe decrees on women's dress, that struck a sharp contrast with the relatively liberal policy that Massoud had followed until then. The Taliban responded to the agreement with a further spate of rocket attacks on the capital.<ref>Maley, ''The Afghanistan Wars'', pp. 215\u2013216</ref> The Rabbani/Hekmatyar regime lasted only a few months before the Taliban took control of Kabul in September 1996. Many of the HIG local commanders joined the Taliban \"both out of ideological sympathy and for reason of tribal solidarity.\" <ref>''The Columbia World Dictionary of Islamism'', Olivier Roy, Antoine Sfeir, editors, (2007), p. 133</ref> Those that did not were expelled by the Taliban. In Pakistan Hezb-e-Islami training camps \"were taken over by the Taliban and handed over\" to [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]] (JUI) groups such as the [[Sipah-e-Sahaba]] Pakistan (SSP).<ref>Rashid, ''Taliban'', p. 92</ref>\nHekmatyar then fled to [[Iran]] in 1997 where he is said to have resided for almost six years, although he claimed in August 1998 that he still remained in Afghanistan.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/149384.stm</ref> Isolated from Afghanistan he is reported to have \"lost ... his power base back home\" to defections or inactivity of former members. He was also distrusted by the Iranian Government who found him too unpredictable, unreliable, and an unnecessary liability, considering its tense relations at the time with the Taliban and the Pakistani government, and despite his pleas, the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guards]] refused to establish a proxy through any of his organizations or assist him in any way.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2701547.stm | work=BBC News | title=Profile: Gulbuddin Hekmatyar | date=2010-03-23}}</ref> Allegedly, they even cut his phone lines and turned away anyone who wished to see him in his villa in North Tehran.<ref>{{cite web|last=Karon |first=Tony |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,212595,00.html |title=Iran, Afghanistan Juggle Hot Potato Hekmatyar |magazine=TIME |date=2002-02-23 |accessdate=2014-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Post-9/11 activities==\nAfter the [[9/11]] attacks in the [[United States]] Hekmatyar, who had allegedly \"worked closely\" with bin Laden in early 1990s,<ref>Bergen, Peter L., ''Holy war, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden'', New York: Free Press, 2001, pp. 70\u201371</ref> declared his opposition to the US campaign in Afghanistan and criticized Pakistan for assisting the United States. After the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|U.S. entry into the anti-Taliban alliance]] and the fall of the [[Taliban]], Hekmatyar rejected the [[U.N.]]-brokered accord of 5 December 2001 negotiated in Germany as a post-Taliban interim government for Afghanistan.
