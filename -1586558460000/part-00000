The lower receiver holds the [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]] assembly including the [[Hammer (firearms)|hammer]], and is the attachment point for the [[buttstock]]. The lower receiver is attached to the upper receiver by two removable pins. Disassembly for cleaning or repair of malfunctions often requires the removal of these pins. Removal of the rear take-down pin allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a [[hinge]].<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe upper receiver contains the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] carrier assembly and is attached to the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] assembly. [[Sight (device)|Sights]] will be attached to the upper receiver or the barrel assembly. A handguard usually encloses the barrel and a [[gas-operated reloading]] device using burnt powder gas vented from a hole (or port) in the barrel near the forward end of the handguard. The handguard is attached to the upper receiver and may also be attached to the barrel.<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe initial design included a tube to vent burnt powder gas back into the bolt carrier assembly where it expands in a variable volume chamber forcing the bolt open to eject the spent cartridge case. A buffer spring in the buttstock then pushes the bolt closed picking up a new cartridge from the magazine. This direct gas impingement (DGI) system has the disadvantage of venting un-burned [[smokeless powder]] residue into the receiver where it may ultimately accumulate in quantities causing malfunctions. A more recent alternative design has a metal operating rod pushing against the bolt carrier from a gas piston under the handguard near the barrel port.

These carbines have become popular for police use in confined urban spaces, and the collapsible buttstock compensates for the additional thickness of [[body armor]]. The shorter barrel reduced bullet velocity by about five percent, and bullet energy by about ten percent. The shorter barrel required moving the gas port closer to the chamber exposing the self-loading system to higher pressures and temperatures which increase stress on moving parts like the bolt lugs and extractor. Although Colt offered a heavier 20-inch barrel for improved accuracy beginning in 1986, increased barrel weight may impair [[ergonomic]] balance; so shorter barrels have dominated recent rifle production.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knupp |first=Jeremiah |year=2019 |title=This Is My Rifle: The Case For The 20\"-Barreled AR-15 |journal=American Rifleman |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=41\u201345 & 70\u201372 |publisher=[[National Rifle Association]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, sales of AR-15 style rifles increased dramatically, partly as a result of the introduction of the flat top upper receiver (M4 variant) which allowed scopes and sighting devices to be easily mounted as well as new features such as free floating hand guards that increased accuracy.<ref name=\"Mann2014\"/> While only a handful of companies were manufacturing these rifles in 1994, by the 21st century the number of AR-15 style rifles had more than doubled.<ref name=\"Sweeney2016bm\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Gunsmithing the AR-15, the Bench Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88WdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=30 August 2016|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-4660-9|pages=7\u20139}}</ref> From 2000 to 2015, the number of manufacturers of AR-15 style variants and knock-offs increased from 29 to about 500.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Makes the AR-15 So Appealing to Mass Shooters? |url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/ar-15-mass-murderer-link/ |first=Meghan |last=O\u2019Dea |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=February 15, 2018 |quote=While Colt alone makes the official AR-15, variants and knock-offs are made by a huge number of gun manufactures, including Bushmaster, Les Baer, Remington, Smith & Wesson (swhc, +0.00%), and Sturm & Ruger (rgr, -2.04%), just to name a few.

The lower receiver is attached to the upper receiver by two removable pins. Disassembly for cleaning or repair of malfunctions often requires the removal of these pins. Removal of the rear take-down pin allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a [[hinge]].<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe upper receiver contains the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] carrier assembly and is attached to the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] assembly.

The handguard is attached to the upper receiver and may also be attached to the barrel.<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe initial design included a tube to vent burnt powder gas back into the bolt carrier assembly where it expands in a variable volume chamber forcing the bolt open to eject the spent cartridge case. A buffer spring in the buttstock then pushes the bolt closed picking up a new cartridge from the magazine. This direct gas impingement (DGI) system has the disadvantage of venting un-burned [[smokeless powder]] residue into the receiver where it may ultimately accumulate in quantities causing malfunctions. A more recent alternative design has a metal operating rod pushing against the bolt carrier from a gas piston under the handguard near the barrel port.

Military models were produced with firing modes, [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic fire]] and either fully [[Automatic firearm|automatic fire]] mode or [[Burst mode (weapons)|burst fire]] mode, in which the rifle fires several rounds in succession when the trigger is depressed.

The semi-automatic bolt carrier has a longer lightening slot to prevent the bolt's engagement with an automatic sear. Due to a decrease in mass the buffer spring is heavier. On the select fire version, the hammer has an extra spur which interacts with the additional auto-sear that holds it back until the bolt carrier group is fully in battery, when automatic fire is selected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hanks|first1=D.

These carbines have become popular for police use in confined urban spaces, and the collapsible buttstock compensates for the additional thickness of [[body armor]]. The shorter barrel reduced bullet velocity by about five percent, and bullet energy by about ten percent. The shorter barrel required moving the gas port closer to the chamber exposing the self-loading system to higher pressures and temperatures which increase stress on moving parts like the bolt lugs and extractor. Although Colt offered a heavier 20-inch barrel for improved accuracy beginning in 1986, increased barrel weight may impair [[ergonomic]] balance; so shorter barrels have dominated recent rifle production.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knupp |first=Jeremiah |year=2019 |title=This Is My Rifle: The Case For The 20\"-Barreled AR-15 |journal=American Rifleman |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=41\u201345 & 70\u201372 |publisher=[[National Rifle Association]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, sales of AR-15 style rifles increased dramatically, partly as a result of the introduction of the flat top upper receiver (M4 variant) which allowed scopes and sighting devices to be easily mounted as well as new features such as free floating hand guards that increased accuracy.<ref name=\"Mann2014\"/> While only a handful of companies were manufacturing these rifles in 1994, by the 21st century the number of AR-15 style rifles had more than doubled.<ref name=\"Sweeney2016bm\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Gunsmithing the AR-15, the Bench Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88WdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=30 August 2016|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-4660-9|pages=7\u20139}}</ref> From 2000 to 2015, the number of manufacturers of AR-15 style variants and knock-offs increased from 29 to about 500.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Makes the AR-15 So Appealing to Mass Shooters? |url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/ar-15-mass-murderer-link/ |first=Meghan |last=O\u2019Dea |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=February 15, 2018 |quote=While Colt alone makes the official AR-15, variants and knock-offs are made by a huge number of gun manufactures, including Bushmaster, Les Baer, Remington, Smith & Wesson (swhc, +0.00%), and Sturm & Ruger (rgr, -2.04%), just to name a few.

[[C.F. Monterrey|Monterrey]] are the title holders, but did not qualify for this tournament and are unable to defend their title.\n\nOn 12 March 2020, CONCACAF announced the decision to suspend the tournament with immediate effect due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"CONCACAF20200312\">{{cite web|url=https://www.concacafchampionsleague.com/en/article/concacaf-suspends-scotiabank-concacaf-champions-league-with-immediate-effect|title=Concacaf suspends Scotiabank Concacaf Champions League with immediate effect|publisher=CONCACAF Champions League|date=12 March 2020}}</ref> On 13 March 2020, CONCACAF suspended all upcoming competitions scheduled to take place over the next 30 days, with the new dates of the matches to be confirmed later.<ref name=\"CONCACAF20200313\">{{cite web|url=https://www.concacaf.com/en/article/concacaf-suspends-all-its-competitions-scheduled-to-take-place-over-the-next-30-days|title=Concacaf suspends all its competitions scheduled to take place over the next 30 days|publisher=CONCACAF|date=13 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Qualification==\nA total of 16 teams participate in the CONCACAF Champions League:\n*Ten teams which directly qualify for the tournament:\n**[[North American Football Union|North American Zone]]: 9 teams (from three associations)\n**[[Caribbean Football Union|Caribbean Zone]]: 1 team (from one association)\n*Six teams qualify through the [[CONCACAF League]] (from between two and six associations)\n\nTherefore, teams from between 6 and 10 out of the 41 CONCACAF member associations may participate in the CONCACAF Champions League.\n\n===North America===\nThe nine direct berths for the [[North American Football Union]] (NAFU), which consists of three member associations, were allocated as follows: four berths each for Mexico and the United States, and one berth for Canada.\n\nFor Mexico, the champions and runners-up of the [[Liga MX]] [[Apertura and Clausura]] Liguilla (playoff) tournaments qualified for the CONCACAF Champions League. If there was any team which were finalists of both tournaments, the vacated berth was reallocated using a formula, based on regular season records, that ensured that two teams qualified via each tournament.\n\nFor the United States, four teams qualified for the CONCACAF Champions League, three through the [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) season and one through its domestic cup competition:\n*The champions of the [[MLS Cup]], the championship match of the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]]\n*The champions of the [[Supporters' Shield]], awarded to the team with the best MLS regular season record\n*The MLS regular season champions of either the [[Eastern Conference (MLS)|Eastern Conference]] or [[Western Conference (MLS)|Western Conference]] which were not the Supporters' Shield champions\n*The champions of the [[U.S. Open Cup]]\nIf there was any team which qualified through multiple berths, or if there was any Canada-based MLS team which were champions of the MLS Cup, the Supporters' Shield, or conference regular season, the vacated berth was reallocated to the U.S.-based team with the best MLS regular season record not yet qualified.\n\nFor Canada, the champions of the [[Canadian Championship]], its domestic cup competition which awards the [[Voyageurs Cup]], qualified for the CONCACAF Champions League. While some Canada-based teams compete in MLS, they could not qualify through either the MLS regular season or playoffs. Moreover, a team from the [[Canadian Premier League]] qualified for the CONCACAF League, meaning a second team from Canada (and a tenth team from North America) could qualify for the CONCACAF Champions League.\n\n===Central America===\nTeams from the [[Central American Football Union]] (UNCAF), which consists of seven member associations, must qualify for the CONCACAF Champions League through the CONCACAF League. A total of 18 teams from Central America qualify for the CONCACAF League through their domestic leagues.
