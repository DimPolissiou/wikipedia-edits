Hoping to gain both plunder and a powerful [[vassal state]], Mongol leader [[Genghis Khan]] commanded some initial raids against Western Xia before launching a full-scale invasion in 1209. This marked both the first major invasion conducted by Genghis and the beginning of the [[Mongol invasion of China]]. Despite a major set-back during a nearly year-long siege of the capital, [[Yinchuan]], when the diverted river accidentally flooded their camp, the Mongols convinced Emperor [[Li Anquan]] to surrender in January 1210. For nearly a decade the Western Xia served the Mongols as vassals and aided them in the [[Mongol\u2013Jin War]], but when Genghis [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|invaded]] the Islamic [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] in 1219, Western Xia attempted to break away from the Empire and ally with the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]]. Angered by this betrayal, in 1225 Genghis Khan sent a second, [[punitive expedition]] into Western Xia. Genghis intended to annihilate the entire Western Xia culture, and his campaign systematically destroyed Western Xia cities and the countryside, culminating in the siege of the capital in 1227 along with forays into Jin territory. Near the end of the siege, in August 1227, Genghis Khan died from an uncertain cause, though some accounts say he was killed in action against Western Xia. After his death, Yinchuan fell to the Mongols and most of its population was massacred. The destruction of Western Xia during the second campaign was near total. According to [[John Man (author)|John Man]], Western Xia is little known to anyone other than experts in the field precisely because of Genghis Khan's policy calling for their complete eradication. He states that \"There is a case to be made that this was the first ever recorded example of attempted [[genocide]].

Cromwell invaded Ireland with his [[New Model Army]] on behalf of [[England]]'s [[Rump Parliament]] in August 1649. Following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], most of Ireland came under the control of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Catholic Confederation]]. In early 1649, the Confederates allied with the English [[Cavalier|Royalists]], who had been defeated by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in the [[English Civil War]]. By May 1652, Cromwell's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country\u2014bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] (or Eleven Years' War). However, [[guerrilla warfare]] continued for a further year. Cromwell passed a series of [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] against [[Roman Catholics]] (the vast majority of the population) and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|confiscated large amounts of their land]]. During the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (1651\u20131660), this policy was enhanced with the passing of the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement of Ireland]] in 1652. Its goal was a further transfer of land from Irish to English hands.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} The immediate war aims and the longer term policies of the English Parliamentarians resulted in an attempt by the English to transfer the native population to the western fringes to make way for Protestant settlers.

He discovered that a number of Gaulish tribes had attempted to pay these Germani generously to leave, but the Tencteri and Usipetes had ranged further, coming to the frontiers of the [[Condrusi]] and [[Eburones]], who were both under the protection of the [[Treveri]] to their south. Caesar convened a meeting of the Gaulish chiefs, and, pretending he did not know of their attempts at bribery, demanded cavalry and provisions for war against the Tencteri and Usipetes. The Germanic cavalry, although outnumbered by Caesar's Gallic horsemen, made the first attack, forcing the Romans to retreat. Caesar describes a characteristic battle-tactic they used, where a horsemen would leap down to their feet and stab enemy horses in the belly. Accusing them of violating the truce, Caesar refused to accept any more ambassadors, arresting some who came requesting a further truce, and led his full force against the Germanic camp. The Usipetes and Tencteri were thrown into disarray and forced to flee, pursued by Caesar's cavalry, to the confluence of the Rhine and Meuse. Many were killed attempting to cross the rivers.<ref>[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 4#1|4.1-15]]</ref><ref>Lee, K.H. \"Caesar's Encounter with the Usipetes and the Tencteri.\" ''Greece & Rome'' 2nd vol. 2 (1969): 100-103.</ref> They found refuge on the other side of the Rhine amongst the [[Sicambri]].

It was carried out by Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Soviet state security and secret police, acting on behalf of Joseph Stalin. Within three days, Beria's NKVD used cattle trains to deport women, children, the elderly, even Communists and members of the Red Army, to the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan, several thousand kilometres away.

Professor Lyman H. Legters argued that the Soviet penal system, combined with its resettlement policies, should count as genocidal since the sentences were borne most heavily specifically on certain ethnic groups, and that a relocation of these ethnic groups, whose survivial depends on ties to its particular homeland, \"had a genocidal effect remediable only by restoration of the group to its homeland\".{{sfn|Legters|1992|p=104}} Soviet dissidents Ilya Gabay{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=150}} and [[Pyotr Grigorenko]]{{sfn|Allworth|1998|p=216}} both classified the event as a genocide.

The genocide seldom entered Western discourse, both due to ignorance and to the Cold-War politics which made West Germany a new ally of the United States.The first significant work on the subject published in English was [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s ''Final Solution'' (1953), which, relying almost exclusively on German documentation, estimated 4.9 million dead. This figure is now considered extremely conservative. [[Raul Hilberg]]'s 1961 ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' became a classic in the field of Holocaust literature and made the genocide of the Jews known to the wider public, Hilberg estimated its victims to be 5.1 million lives, or 4.9 - 5.4 million broadly construed. The [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|trial of Adolph Eichmann]] further raised awareness of the genocide, Eichmann also provided documentation and testimony which revised the number of the dead.The first work to arrive at a figure comparable to modern estimates was [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]'s ''[[The War Against the Jews]]'', published in 1975, the book provided detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust which are still used as a reference in modern Holocaust studies. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews. After the opening of Soviet records, scholarship arrived at a death toll of about 6 million Jews. Gutman and Rozett's [[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]] was published in 1990 and estimated slightly over 5.9 million Jews were murdered.[[Wolfgang Benz]]'s ''The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide'', published 1995, gave a toll of 6.2 million.</ref>-->\n<!--<ref name=Benz>{{cite book|author=Benz, Wolfgang|title=The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|year=1999|isbn=0-231-11214-9|pp=152\u201353}}</ref>-->\n\n<ref name=Wheatcroft2001>{{cite book|last=Wheatcroft|first=Stephen G.|year=2001|chapter=Current knowledge of the level and nature of mortality in the Ukrainian famine of 1931\u20133|chapterurl=http://www.melgrosh.unimelb.edu.au/documents/SGW-UkranianFamine_mortality.pdf |editor=V.

Hoping to gain both plunder and a powerful [[vassal state]], Mongol leader [[Genghis Khan]] commanded some initial raids against Western Xia before launching a full-scale invasion in 1209. This marked both the first major invasion conducted by Genghis and the beginning of the [[Mongol invasion of China]]. Despite a major set-back during a nearly year-long siege of the capital, [[Yinchuan]], when the diverted river accidentally flooded their camp, the Mongols convinced Emperor [[Li Anquan]] to surrender in January 1210. For nearly a decade the Western Xia served the Mongols as vassals and aided them in the [[Mongol\u2013Jin War]], but when Genghis [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|invaded]] the Islamic [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] in 1219, Western Xia attempted to break away from the Empire and ally with the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]]. Angered by this betrayal, in 1225 Genghis Khan sent a second, [[punitive expedition]] into Western Xia. Genghis intended to annihilate the entire Western Xia culture, and his campaign systematically destroyed Western Xia cities and the countryside, culminating in the siege of the capital in 1227 along with forays into Jin territory. Near the end of the siege, in August 1227, Genghis Khan died from an uncertain cause, though some accounts say he was killed in action against Western Xia. After his death, Yinchuan fell to the Mongols and most of its population was massacred. The destruction of Western Xia during the second campaign was near total. According to [[John Man (author)|John Man]], Western Xia is little known to anyone other than experts in the field precisely because of Genghis Khan's policy calling for their complete eradication. He states that \"There is a case to be made that this was the first ever recorded example of attempted [[genocide]]. It was certainly very successful ''[[ethnocide]]''.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|authorlink=John Man (author)|title=Genghis Khan: Life, Death, and Resurrection|year=2004|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York City|isbn=9780312366247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXTv9a0HZakC|pages=116\u2013117}}</ref> However, some members of the Western Xia royal clan emigrated to western [[Sichuan]], northern [[Tibet]], even possibly [[Northeast India]], in some instances becoming local rulers.<ref>[[Herbert Franke (sinologist)|Franke, Herbert]] and [[Denis C.

Cromwell invaded Ireland with his [[New Model Army]] on behalf of [[England]]'s [[Rump Parliament]] in August 1649. Following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], most of Ireland came under the control of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Catholic Confederation]]. In early 1649, the Confederates allied with the English [[Cavalier|Royalists]], who had been defeated by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in the [[English Civil War]]. By May 1652, Cromwell's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country\u2014bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] (or Eleven Years' War). However, [[guerrilla warfare]] continued for a further year. Cromwell passed a series of [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] against [[Roman Catholics]] (the vast majority of the population) and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|confiscated large amounts of their land]]. During the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (1651\u20131660), this policy was enhanced with the passing of the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement of Ireland]] in 1652. Its goal was a further transfer of land from Irish to English hands.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} The immediate war aims and the longer term policies of the English Parliamentarians resulted in an attempt by the English to transfer the native population to the western fringes to make way for Protestant settlers.

He discovered that a number of Gaulish tribes had attempted to pay these Germani generously to leave, but the Tencteri and Usipetes had ranged further, coming to the frontiers of the [[Condrusi]] and [[Eburones]], who were both under the protection of the [[Treveri]] to their south. Caesar convened a meeting of the Gaulish chiefs, and, pretending he did not know of their attempts at bribery, demanded cavalry and provisions for war against the Tencteri and Usipetes. The Germanic cavalry, although outnumbered by Caesar's Gallic horsemen, made the first attack, forcing the Romans to retreat. Caesar describes a characteristic battle-tactic they used, where a horsemen would leap down to their feet and stab enemy horses in the belly. Accusing them of violating the truce, Caesar refused to accept any more ambassadors, arresting some who came requesting a further truce, and led his full force against the Germanic camp.

It was carried out by Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Soviet state security and secret police, acting on behalf of Joseph Stalin. Within three days, Beria's NKVD used cattle trains to deport women, children, the elderly, even Communists and members of the Red Army, to the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan, several thousand kilometres away.

Professor Lyman H. Legters argued that the Soviet penal system, combined with its resettlement policies, should count as genocidal since the sentences were borne most heavily specifically on certain ethnic groups, and that a relocation of these ethnic groups, whose survivial depends on ties to its particular homeland, \"had a genocidal effect remediable only by restoration of the group to its homeland\".{{sfn|Legters|1992|p=104}} Soviet dissidents Ilya Gabay{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=150}} and [[Pyotr Grigorenko]]{{sfn|Allworth|1998|p=216}} both classified the event as a genocide.

The genocide seldom entered Western discourse, both due to ignorance and to the Cold-War politics which made West Germany a new ally of the United States.The first significant work on the subject published in English was [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s ''Final Solution'' (1953), which, relying almost exclusively on German documentation, estimated 4.9 million dead. This figure is now considered extremely conservative. [[Raul Hilberg]]'s 1961 ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' became a classic in the field of Holocaust literature and made the genocide of the Jews known to the wider public, Hilberg estimated its victims to be 5.1 million lives, or 4.9 - 5.4 million broadly construed. The [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|trial of Adolph Eichmann]] further raised awareness of the genocide, Eichmann also provided documentation and testimony which revised the number of the dead.The first work to arrive at a figure comparable to modern estimates was [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]'s ''[[The War Against the Jews]]'', published in 1975, the book provided detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust which are still used as a reference in modern Holocaust studies. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews. After the opening of Soviet records, scholarship arrived at a death toll of about 6 million Jews. Gutman and Rozett's [[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]] was published in 1990 and estimated slightly over 5.9 million Jews were murdered.[[Wolfgang Benz]]'s ''The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide'', published 1995, gave a toll of 6.2 million.</ref>-->\n<!--<ref name=Benz>{{cite book|author=Benz, Wolfgang|title=The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|year=1999|isbn=0-231-11214-9|pp=152\u201353}}</ref>-->\n\n<ref name=Wheatcroft2001>{{cite book|last=Wheatcroft|first=Stephen G.|year=2001|chapter=Current knowledge of the level and nature of mortality in the Ukrainian famine of 1931\u20133|chapterurl=http://www.melgrosh.unimelb.edu.au/documents/SGW-UkranianFamine_mortality.pdf |editor=V.

And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Kogury\u014f's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Kogury\u014f capital of P'y\u014fngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Kogury\u014f commander \u016clchi Mund\u014fk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper. Yang Ti continued to send his armies against Kogury\u014f but again without success, and before long his war-weakened empire crumbled.|year=1984}}</ref><ref name=\"Nahm\">{{cite book|last1=Nahm|first1=Andrew C.|title=A Panorama of 5000 Years: Korean History|date=2005|publisher=Hollym International Corporation|location=Seoul|isbn=978-0-930878-68-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/panoramaof5000ye0000nahm/page/18 18]|edition=Second revised|quote=China, which had been split into many states since the early 3rd century, was reunified by the Sui dynasty at the end of the 6th century.

However, the people of Kogury\u014f were united and they were able to repel the Chinese aggressors. In 612, Sui troops invaded Korea again, but Kogury\u014f forces fought bravely and destroyed Sui troops everywhere. General \u016clchi Mund\u014fk of Kogury\u014f completely wiped out some 300,000 Sui troops which came across the Yalu River in the battles near the Salsu River (now Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn River) with his ingenious military tactics.

At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese troops]]. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction, and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate.

This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government.  This instability was broken by the [[May 16 coup|May 16, 1961, coup]] led by General [[Park Chung-hee]]. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] enforced by political repression.\n\nPark was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a [[Yusin Constitution|new constitution]], which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The [[Economy of South Korea|Korean economy]] developed significantly during Park's tenure.  The government developed the [[Expressways in South Korea|nationwide expressway system]], the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul subway system]], and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with [[Assassination of Park Chung-hee|his assassination]] in 1979.\n\nThe years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979 there came the [[Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth]] led by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]]. Following the Coup d'\u00e9tat, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of [[Jejudo]]. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency in the events of May 17, triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy, in particular in the city of [[Gwangju]], to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the [[Gwangju massacre|Gwangju Democratization Movement]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/752055.stm Flashback: The Kwangju massacre], May 17, 2000.</ref>\n\nChun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a [[Seoul National University]] student, [[Bak Jongcheol|Park Jong-chul]], was tortured to death.<ref>[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/184219.html \"20 years later, father still seeks truth in son's death\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173203/http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/184219.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}, ''The Hankyoreh'', January 15, 2007.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The [[Korean royal court cuisine]] once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.\n\nKorean cuisine is largely based on [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[tofu]], vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes, ''[[banchan]]'' (\ubc18\ucc2c), which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. [[Kimchi]] (\uae40\uce58), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with [[sesame oil]], ''[[doenjang]]'' (\ub41c\uc7a5), a type of [[fermented bean paste|fermented soybean paste]], [[Korean soy sauce|soy sauce]], salt, garlic, ginger, and ''[[gochujang]]'' (\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5), a hot pepper paste. Other well-known dishes are ''[[Bulgogi]]'' (\ubd88\uace0\uae30), grilled marinated beef, ''[[Gimbap]]'' (\uae40\ubc25), and ''[[Tteokbokki]]'' (\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774), a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.\n\nSoups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as ''[[guk]]'' (\uad6d) are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, ''tang'' (\ud0d5; \u6e6f) has less water, and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is ''[[jjigae]]'' (\ucc0c\uac1c), a [[stew]] that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.\n\nPopular [[Korean alcoholic beverages]] include [[Soju]], [[Makgeolli]] and [[Bokbunja ju]].\n\nKorea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal [[chopstick]]s. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.<ref>[http://article.joins.com/news/blognews/article.asp?listid=12803159 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \ub3d9\uc5913\uad6d\uc758 \uc813\uac00\ub77d \ubb38\ud654\ube44\uad50].

Many K-pop acts have also been able secure a strong overseas following using online social media platforms such as the video sharing website [[YouTube]]. South Korean singer [[PSY]] became an international sensation when his song \"[[Gangnam Style]]\" topped global music charts in 2012. <!--Do not add a list of groups here without first suggesting it at the Talk page.-->\n\nSince the success of the film ''[[Shiri (film)|Shiri]]'' in 1999, the [[Korean film]] industry has begun to gain recognition internationally. Domestic film has a dominant share of the market, partly because of the existence of [[screen quotas]] requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days a year.<ref>[http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_Ec_detail.htm?No=74142 \"S.Korea's Screen Quota Hinders Market Access\"], KBS World, July 16, 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Television in South Korea|South Korean television shows]] have become popular outside of Korea.

The Sui emperor, Wen Ti, launched a retaliatory attack on Kogury\u014f but met with reverses and turned back in mid-course. Yang Ti, the next Sui emperor, proceeded in 612 to mount an invasion of unprecedented magnitude, marshalling a huge force said to number over a million men. And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Kogury\u014f's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Kogury\u014f capital of P'y\u014fngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Kogury\u014f commander \u016clchi Mund\u014fk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper.

At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese troops]]. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction, and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the [[Ilminism|One-People Principle]] (based on the German [[ideology]] of the ''[[Master race|Herrenvolk]]'') an effort to build an obedient citizenry through [[ethnicity|ethnic]] homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to [[nationalism]].<ref name=Hwang93>Su-kyoung Hwang, ''Korea's Grievous War.''

This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government.  This instability was broken by the [[May 16 coup|May 16, 1961, coup]] led by General [[Park Chung-hee]]. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] enforced by political repression.\n\nPark was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a [[Yusin Constitution|new constitution]], which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The [[Economy of South Korea|Korean economy]] developed significantly during Park's tenure.  The government developed the [[Expressways in South Korea|nationwide expressway system]], the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul subway system]], and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with [[Assassination of Park Chung-hee|his assassination]] in 1979.\n\nThe years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979 there came the [[Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth]] led by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]]. Following the Coup d'\u00e9tat, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of [[Jejudo]]. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency in the events of May 17, triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy, in particular in the city of [[Gwangju]], to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the [[Gwangju massacre|Gwangju Democratization Movement]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/752055.stm Flashback: The Kwangju massacre], May 17, 2000.</ref>\n\nChun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The [[Korean royal court cuisine]] once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.\n\nKorean cuisine is largely based on [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[tofu]], vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes, ''[[banchan]]'' (\ubc18\ucc2c), which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. [[Kimchi]] (\uae40\uce58), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with [[sesame oil]], ''[[doenjang]]'' (\ub41c\uc7a5), a type of [[fermented bean paste|fermented soybean paste]], [[Korean soy sauce|soy sauce]], salt, garlic, ginger, and ''[[gochujang]]'' (\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5), a hot pepper paste. Other well-known dishes are ''[[Bulgogi]]'' (\ubd88\uace0\uae30), grilled marinated beef, ''[[Gimbap]]'' (\uae40\ubc25), and ''[[Tteokbokki]]'' (\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774), a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.\n\nSoups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as ''[[guk]]'' (\uad6d) are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, ''tang'' (\ud0d5; \u6e6f) has less water, and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is ''[[jjigae]]'' (\ucc0c\uac1c), a [[stew]] that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.\n\nPopular [[Korean alcoholic beverages]] include [[Soju]], [[Makgeolli]] and [[Bokbunja ju]].\n\nKorea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal [[chopstick]]s. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.<ref>[http://article.joins.com/news/blognews/article.asp?listid=12803159 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \ub3d9\uc5913\uad6d\uc758 \uc813\uac00\ub77d \ubb38\ud654\ube44\uad50].

Many K-pop acts have also been able secure a strong overseas following using online social media platforms such as the video sharing website [[YouTube]].

He claimed that the medicine he had been taught to practice sometimes did the patient more harm than good:\n<blockquote>My sense of duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown pathological state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was most terrible to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice in the first years of my married life and occupied myself solely with [[chemistry]] and writing.<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter giving up his practice around 1784, Hahnemann made his living chiefly as a writer and translator, while resolving also to investigate the causes of medicine's alleged errors. While translating [[William Cullen]]'s ''A Treatise on the Materia Medica'', Hahnemann encountered the claim that [[cinchona]], the bark of a Peruvian tree, was effective in treating [[malaria]] because of its astringency. Hahnemann believed that other astringent substances are not effective against malaria and began to research cinchona's effect on the human body by self-application. Noting that the drug induced malaria-like symptoms in himself,<ref>Haehl, vol. 1, p.38; Dudgeon, p.48</ref> he concluded that it would do so in any healthy individual. This led him to postulate a healing principle: \"that which can produce a set of symptoms in a healthy individual, can treat a sick individual who is manifesting a similar set of symptoms.\"<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/> This principle, ''like cures like'', became the basis for an approach to medicine which he gave the name [[homeopathy]]. He first used the term homeopathy in his essay ''Indications of the Homeopathic Employment of Medicines in Ordinary Practice'', published in [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland|Hufeland]]'s ''Journal'' in 1807.<ref>Gumpert, Martin (1945) ''Hahnemann: The Adventurous Career of a Medical Rebel'', New York: Fischer, p. 130.</ref>\n\n=== Development of homeopathy ===\nFollowing up the work of the Viennese physician [[Anton von St\u00f6rck]], Hahnemann tested substances for the effects they produced on a healthy individual, presupposing (as von St\u00f6rck had claimed) that they may heal the same ills that they caused. His researches led him to agree with von St\u00f6rck that the toxic effects of ingested substances are often broadly parallel to certain disease states,<ref>Dudgeon, pp.xxi\u2013xxii; Cook, p.95</ref> and his exploration of historical cases of poisoning in the medical literature further implied a more generalised medicinal \"law of similars\".<ref>Dudgeon, p.49 & p.176; Haehl, vol. 1, p.40</ref> He later devised methods of diluting the drugs he was testing in order to mitigate their toxic effects. He claimed that these dilutions, when prepared according to his technique of \"potentization\" using dilution and succussion (vigorous shaking), were still effective in alleviating the same symptoms in the sick. His more systematic  experiments with dose reduction really commenced around 1800\u201301 when, on the basis of his \"law of similars,\" he had begun using ''[[Ipecacuanha]]'' for the treatment of coughs and [[Belladonna (plant)|Belladonna]] for scarlet fever.<ref>Cook, pp.96\u20137; Dudgeon, pp.338\u2013340 & pp.394\u2013408</ref>\n\nHe first published an article about the homeopathic approach in a [[German-language]] medical journal in 1796. Following a series of further essays, he published in 1810 \"Organon of the Rational Art of Healing\", followed over the years by four further editions entitled ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art]]'', the first systematic treatise and containing all his detailed instructions on the subject. A 6th ''Organon'' edition, unpublished during his lifetime, and dating from February 1842, was only published many years after his death. It consisted  of a 5th ''Organon'' containing extensive handwritten annotations.<ref>[http://www.minimum.com/reviews/organon-sixth.htm Sixth Organon book review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021000237/http://www.minimum.com/reviews/organon-sixth.htm |date=21 October 2010 }}.

Retrieved on 16 May 2012.</ref> The ''Organon'' is widely regarded as a remodelled form of an essay he published in 1806 called \"The Medicine of Experience\", which had been published in Hufeland's Journal.

As required by the university statutes, to become a faculty member he was required to submit and defend a thesis on a medical topic of his choice. On 26 June 1812, Hahnemann presented a [[Latin]] thesis, entitled ''\"A Medical Historical Dissertation on the Helleborism of the Ancients.\"''<ref>Bradford, p. 93.</ref> His thesis very thoroughly examined the historical literature and sought  to differentiate between the ancient use of ''[[Helleborus niger]]'', or black hellebore, and the medicinal uses of the \"white hellebore\", botanically ''[[Veratrum album]]'', both of which are poisonous plants.<ref>Haehl, Vol. 2, p. 96.</ref>\n\nHahnemann continued practicing and researching homeopathy, as well as writing and lecturing for the rest of his life.

He claimed that the medicine he had been taught to practice sometimes did the patient more harm than good:\n<blockquote>My sense of duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown pathological state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was most terrible to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice in the first years of my married life and occupied myself solely with [[chemistry]] and writing.<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter giving up his practice around 1784, Hahnemann made his living chiefly as a writer and translator, while resolving also to investigate the causes of medicine's alleged errors. While translating [[William Cullen]]'s ''A Treatise on the Materia Medica'', Hahnemann encountered the claim that [[cinchona]], the bark of a Peruvian tree, was effective in treating [[malaria]] because of its astringency. Hahnemann believed that other astringent substances are not effective against malaria and began to research cinchona's effect on the human body by self-application. Noting that the drug induced malaria-like symptoms in himself,<ref>Haehl, vol. 1, p.38; Dudgeon, p.48</ref> he concluded that it would do so in any healthy individual. This led him to postulate a healing principle: \"that which can produce a set of symptoms in a healthy individual, can treat a sick individual who is manifesting a similar set of symptoms.\"<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/> This principle, ''like cures like'', became the basis for an approach to medicine which he gave the name [[homeopathy]]. He first used the term homeopathy in his essay ''Indications of the Homeopathic Employment of Medicines in Ordinary Practice'', published in [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland|Hufeland]]'s ''Journal'' in 1807.<ref>Gumpert, Martin (1945) ''Hahnemann: The Adventurous Career of a Medical Rebel'', New York: Fischer, p. 130.</ref>\n\n=== Development of homeopathy ===\nFollowing up the work of the Viennese physician [[Anton von St\u00f6rck]], Hahnemann tested substances for the effects they produced on a healthy individual, presupposing (as von St\u00f6rck had claimed) that they may heal the same ills that they caused. His researches led him to agree with von St\u00f6rck that the toxic effects of ingested substances are often broadly parallel to certain disease states,<ref>Dudgeon, pp.xxi\u2013xxii; Cook, p.95</ref> and his exploration of historical cases of poisoning in the medical literature further implied a more generalised medicinal \"law of similars\".<ref>Dudgeon, p.49 & p.176; Haehl, vol. 1, p.40</ref> He later devised methods of diluting the drugs he was testing in order to mitigate their toxic effects. He claimed that these dilutions, when prepared according to his technique of \"potentization\" using dilution and succussion (vigorous shaking), were still effective in alleviating the same symptoms in the sick. His more systematic  experiments with dose reduction really commenced around 1800\u201301 when, on the basis of his \"law of similars,\" he had begun using ''[[Ipecacuanha]]'' for the treatment of coughs and [[Belladonna (plant)|Belladonna]] for scarlet fever.<ref>Cook, pp.96\u20137; Dudgeon, pp.338\u2013340 & pp.394\u2013408</ref>\n\nHe first published an article about the homeopathic approach in a [[German-language]] medical journal in 1796. Following a series of further essays, he published in 1810 \"Organon of the Rational Art of Healing\", followed over the years by four further editions entitled ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art]]'', the first systematic treatise and containing all his detailed instructions on the subject. A 6th ''Organon'' edition, unpublished during his lifetime, and dating from February 1842, was only published many years after his death.

The need to quickly circulate current results within a scholarly community has led researchers to distribute documents known as preprints, which are manuscripts that have yet to undergo [[peer review]]. The immediate distribution of preprints allows authors to receive early feedback from their peers, which may be helpful in revising and preparing articles for submission.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/05/01/breaking-down-pros-and-cons-of-preprints-in-biomedicine/|title=Breaking Down Pros and Cons of Preprints in Biomedicine |date=2016-05-01|work=Absolutely Maybe|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMost publishers allow work to be published to preprint servers before submission.

LISSA was launched in 2017 as an open access repository for all materials created by those in LIS and allied fields, including work that happens outside the traditional realms of academia, such as oral histories, community works, code, data, and manuscripts. It is run by members of the library and archives community, and their technology partner, the Center for Open Science, using the [[Open Science Framework]] to host materials.\n\n=== Physical sciences ===\nThe e-print archive [[arXiv]] (pronounced \"archive\") is one of the best-known preprint servers.

In his column in  ''[[Physics Today]]'', April 1992, [[David Mermin]] described Ginsparg's creation as potentially \"[[string theory]]'s greatest contribution to science\".

''E-prints'' can now refer to any electronic form of a scholarly or scientific publication, including journal articles, conference papers, research theses or dissertations, because these usually are found in multidisciplinary collections, called open access repositories, or eprints archives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graziotin|first=Daniel|last2=Wang|first2=Xiaofeng|last3=Abrahamsson|first3=Pekka|date=2014|title=A framework for systematic analysis of open access journals and its application in software engineering and information systems|journal=Scientometrics|volume=101|issue=3|pages=1627\u20131656|doi=10.1007/s11192-014-1278-7|arxiv=1308.2597}}</ref>\n\n=== Biological and chemical sciences ===\nThe biological sciences have lagged behind the physical sciences in their use of preprints.

The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available free, before and/or after a paper is published in a journal.\n\n==Role==\nPublication of manuscripts in a peer-reviewed journal often takes weeks, months or even years from the time of initial submission, owing to the time required by editors and reviewers to evaluate and critique manuscripts, and the time required by authors to address critiques. The need to quickly circulate current results within a scholarly community has led researchers to distribute documents known as preprints, which are manuscripts that have yet to undergo [[peer review]]. The immediate distribution of preprints allows authors to receive early feedback from their peers, which may be helpful in revising and preparing articles for submission.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/05/01/breaking-down-pros-and-cons-of-preprints-in-biomedicine/|title=Breaking Down Pros and Cons of Preprints in Biomedicine |date=2016-05-01|work=Absolutely Maybe|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nSince 1991, preprints have increasingly been distributed electronically on the [[Internet]], rather than as paper copies. This has given rise to massive preprint databases such as [[arXiv.org]] and to [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]]. The sharing of preprints goes back to at least the 1960s, when the [[National Institutes of Health]] circulated biological preprints.

''Major'' Domaschk then decided on 28 April: \"[[Army Group B|''Heeresgruppe B'']], postpone!\" In this instance the nomination was not processed due to ''AHA 44 Ziff. 572'' but also because statements from his commanding officers could not be obtained anymore due to the capitulation. The nomination list for the higher grades of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross also contains a note from 10 April 1945: postponed. A bestowal thus did not occur. The [[Association of Knight's Cross Recipients]] (AKCR) claims that the award was presented in accordance with the [[D\u00f6nitz-decree]].

The presentation, according to [[Walther-Peer Fellgiebel]], was made by ''[[Feldmarschall]]'' [[Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner]] based on the empowerment of 3 May 1945. According to Franz Thomas and G\u00fcnter Wegmann, authors of the book series \"''Die Ritterkreuztr\u00e4ger der Deutschen Wehrmacht 1939\u20131945\u2014The Knight's Cross Bearers of the German Wehrmacht 1939\u20131945''\", the presentation was authorized via radio message from the [[Army Group Centre|Heeresgruppe Mitte]] via the combat commander of the [[20th Panzer Division|20. Panzer-Division]], and communicated by the chief of the Stabsbatterie, Leutnant Cornehl, near the [[Tepl\u00e1 Abbey]] near [[Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b]]. The presentation was noted in [[Heinz Timpe]]'s paybook. Presumably Timpe had been nominated three times for Knight\u2019s Cross, first time in September 1944, in January 1945 and April 1945. The Federal Archive holds neither record of nomination, rejection nor a file card of any proceedings. The order commission of the [[Association of Knight's Cross Recipients]] (AKCR) never processed his case either.<ref name=\"Scherzer p180\">Scherzer 2007, p. 180.</ref>|group=\"Note\"}}\n| [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]] || <span style=\"display:none\">12-H</span>''[[Leutnant]]'' || Chief of the 1./Sturmgesch\u00fctz-Brigade 300 (F)<ref name=\"Fellgiebel p424\"/> || {{dts|format=dmy|1945|May|7}} || {{center|\u2014}} || {{center|\u2014}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Adolf-Hilmar von|Tippelskirch}}\n| [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]] || <span style=\"display:none\">13-H</span>''[[Oberleutnant]]''<ref name=\"Scherzer p746\"/> || Chief of the 1./Artillerie-Regiment 3 (motorized)<ref name=\"Scherzer p746\"/><ref name=\"Fellgiebel p424\"/> || {{dts|format=dmy|1941|September|29}}<ref name=\"Scherzer p746\"/> || {{center|\u2014}} || {{center|\u2014}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#C0EFBA\" align=\"left\" | {{sortname|Kurt von|Tippelskirch}}+\n| [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]] || <span style=\"display:none\">19-H</span>''[[Generalleutnant]]''<ref name=\"Scherzer p746\"/> || Commander of the [[30th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|30.

According to Veit Scherzer, on 8 May 1945, Turnwald, as ''[[Leutnant]]'' of the [[Military reserves|Reserves]] and leader of Jagdpanzer-Kompanie 1015, had been nominated for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. The nomination of the ''[[Heerespersonalamt]]'' (HPA\u2014Army Personnel Office) was ready for signature but the process was never completed. In similar instances the AKCR had argued that the presentation was in accordance with the [[D\u00f6nitz-decree]].

Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996 the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author [[Veit Scherzer]] has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings.

OB West responded on 24 April (entry date at the ''Heerespersonalamt'' on 28 April): \"Statement from OB West not possible, since nomination was not made via OB West\". ''Major'' Domaschk then decided on 28 April: \"[[Army Group B|''Heeresgruppe B'']], postpone!\" In this instance the nomination was not processed due to ''AHA 44 Ziff. 572'' but also because statements from his commanding officers could not be obtained anymore due to the capitulation. The nomination list for the higher grades of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross also contains a note from 10 April 1945: postponed. A bestowal thus did not occur. The [[Association of Knight's Cross Recipients]] (AKCR) claims that the award was presented in accordance with the [[D\u00f6nitz-decree]].

The presentation, according to [[Walther-Peer Fellgiebel]], was made by ''[[Feldmarschall]]'' [[Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner]] based on the empowerment of 3 May 1945. According to Franz Thomas and G\u00fcnter Wegmann, authors of the book series \"''Die Ritterkreuztr\u00e4ger der Deutschen Wehrmacht 1939\u20131945\u2014The Knight's Cross Bearers of the German Wehrmacht 1939\u20131945''\", the presentation was authorized via radio message from the [[Army Group Centre|Heeresgruppe Mitte]] via the combat commander of the [[20th Panzer Division|20. Panzer-Division]], and communicated by the chief of the Stabsbatterie, Leutnant Cornehl, near the [[Tepl\u00e1 Abbey]] near [[Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b]]. The presentation was noted in [[Heinz Timpe]]'s paybook. Presumably Timpe had been nominated three times for Knight\u2019s Cross, first time in September 1944, in January 1945 and April 1945. The Federal Archive holds neither record of nomination, rejection nor a file card of any proceedings.

The nomination of the ''[[Heerespersonalamt]]'' (HPA\u2014Army Personnel Office) was ready for signature but the process was never completed.

This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture, while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into [[Scandinavia]] itself, with profound developmental implications in both directions. During the Viking Age the Norse homelands were gradually consolidated into three larger kingdoms, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The [[Normans]], descendants of Vikings who became rulers of [[Normandy]] which was named after them, also formed the aristocracy of England from the [[Norman conquest of England]].\n\nNorse civilisation during the Viking Age was technologically, military and culturally advanced. Yet popular, modern conceptions of the Vikings\u2014the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia\u2014often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from [[archaeology]] and historical sources, namely that of the advanced civilisation that Norsemen were.

The Old Norse feminine ''v\u00edking'' (as in the phrase ''fara \u00ed v\u00edking'') may originally have been a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey, because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A ''v\u00edkingr'' (the masculine) would then originally have been a participant on a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers. In that case, the word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians begun to dominate the seas.<ref name=\"Eldar Heide 2008 23\u201328\"/>\n\nIn [[Old English]], the word ''wicing'' appears first in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] poem, ''[[Widsith]]'', which probably dates from the 9th century. In Old English, and in the history of the archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Hamburg-Bremen]] written by [[Adam of Bremen]] in about 1070, the term generally referred to Scandinavian pirates or raiders. As in the Old Norse usages, the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general. The word does not occur in any preserved [[Middle English]] texts. One theory made by the [[Iceland]]er \u00d6rnolfur Kristjansson is that the key to the origins of the word is \"''wicinga cynn''\" in Widsith, referring to the people or the race living in [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] (York, in the ninth century under control by Norsemen), ''J\u00f3r-Wicings'' (note, however, that this is not the origin of ''J\u00f3rv\u00edk'').<ref name=\"arch in europe\">{{cite web|last=Beard |first=David |title=The Term \"Viking\" |url=http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |work=archeurope.com |publisher=Archaeology in Europe |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407050944/http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''Viking'' was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"[[barbarian]] warrior\" or [[noble savage]]. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer to not only seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), but also any member of the culture that produced said raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like ''Viking age'', ''Viking culture'', ''Viking art'', ''Viking religion'', ''Viking ship'' and so on.<ref name=\"arch in europe\"/>\n\nThe term \u201dViking\u201d that appeared in Northwestern Germanic sources in the Viking Age denoted pirates. According to some researchers, the term back then had no geographic or ethnic connotations that limited it to Scandinavia only. The term was instead used about anyone who to the Norse peoples appeared as a pirate. Therefore, the term had been used about Israelites on the Red Sea; Muslims encountering Scandinavians in the Mediterranean; Caucasian pirates encountering the famous Swedish Ingvar-Expedition, and Estonian pirates on the Baltic Sea. Thus the term \"Viking\" was supposedly never limited to a single ethnicity as such, but rather an activity.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/8906219/_Vikings_and_the_Viking_Age?email_work_card=title]</ref>\n\n===Other names===\n[[File:Europe 814.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Europe in 814.

England suffered from internal divisions and was relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or to navigable rivers. Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted. The decline in the profitability of old [[trade route]]s could also have played a role. Trade between western Europe and the rest of Eurasia suffered a severe blow when the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell in the 5th century.<ref>{{cite web |last=Macauley Richardson |first=Lloyd |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/72831997.html |title=Books: Eurasian Exploration |work=Policy Review |publisher=Hoover Institution |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216043007/http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/72831997.html |archivedate=2009-12-16}}</ref> The expansion of Islam in the 7th century had also affected trade with western Europe.<ref>Crone, Patricia.

The [[Jutes]] invaded the British Isles three centuries earlier, pouring out from [[Jutland]] during the [[Age of Migrations]], before the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] settled there. The [[Saxons]] and the [[Angles]] did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |title=Viking expeditions and raids |publisher=National Museum of Denmark |accessdate=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172137/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |archive-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : a very short introduction|last=Richards|first=J.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea.

Its inhabitants were known as [[Jomsvikings]]. Jomsborg's exact location, or its existence, has not yet been established, though it is often maintained that Jomsborg was somewhere on the islands of the [[Oder]] estuary.<ref>[[T. D. Kendrick]], ''A History of the Vikings'', Courier Dover Publications, 2004, pp. 179ff, {{ISBN|978-0-486-43396-7}}</ref>\n\n===End of the Viking Age===\nDuring the Viking Age, Scandinavian men and women travelled to many parts of Europe and beyond, in a cultural diaspora that left its traces from [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] to [[Byzantium]]. This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, which were subject to a variety of new influences.<ref>Roesdahl, pp. 295\u201397</ref> In the 300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia underwent profound cultural changes.\n\nBy the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the [[Catholic Church]] (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.<ref>Gareth Williams, \"Kingship, Christianity and coinage: monetary and political perspectives on silver economy in the Viking Age\", in ''Silver Economy in the Viking Age'', ed. [[James Graham-Campbell]] and Gareth Williams, pp.&nbsp;177\u2013214; {{ISBN|978-1-59874-222-0}}</ref> By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.<ref>Roesdahl, p. 296</ref>\n\n==== Assimilation into Christendom ====\n[[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianity had taken root]] in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at [[Lund]], Scania, then part of Denmark.\n\nThe assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so [[chattel slavery]] diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.\n\nThe kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, [[Sigurd I of Norway]] sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>The Northern Crusades: Second Edition by Eric Christiansen; {{ISBN|0-14-026653-4}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on [[runestone]]s. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|title=Written sources shed light on Viking travels|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172414/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|archive-date=18 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.<ref>Hall, 2010, pp. 8 ''passim''.</ref><ref>Roesdahl, pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices.\n\n===Literature and language===\n{{See also|Old Norse|The Norse Sagas }}\n[[File:Lbs fragm 82, 0001v - 1.jpg|thumb|One of the few surviving manuscript leaves from the [[Heimskringla Saga]]s, written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] c. 1260. The leaf tells of [[Olaf II of Norway|King \u00d3lafur]].]]\n\nThe most important [[primary sources]] on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.<ref>Hall, pp. 8\u201311</ref> Writing in [[Latin]] letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.<ref>Lindqvist, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in [[runes]], but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.\n\nLater writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval [[Christian culture]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the [[Saga|Icelandic sagas]]. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of [[skald]]ic poetry attributed to [[Poet laureate|court poets]] of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.\n\nIndirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like [[Egilsay]] (from ''Eigils ey'' meaning Eigil's Island), [[Ormskirk]] (from ''Ormr kirkja'' meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), [[Meols]] (from ''merl'' meaning Sand Dunes), [[Snaefell]] (Snow Fell), [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] (Ravens Rock), [[Vinland]] (Land of Wine or Land of [[Winberry]]), [[Kaupanger]] (Market Harbour), [[T\u00f3rshavn]] (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of [[Odense]], meaning a place where [[Odin]] was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the [[Tynwald]] on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nCommon words in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays ([[Thursday]] means Thor's day), [[wikt:axle|axle]], [[wikt:crook|crook]], [[wikt:raft|raft]], [[wikt:knife|knife]], [[wikt:plough|plough]], [[wikt:leather|leather]], [[wikt:window|window]], [[berserker|berserk]], [[bylaw]], [[thorp]], [[skerry]], [[wikt:husband|husband]], {{linktext|heathen}}, [[Hel (being)|Hell]], [[Normans|Norman]] and [[wikt:ransack|ransack]] stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give us an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.<ref>See [[List of English words of Old Norse origin]] for further explanations on specific words.</ref> In the [[Northern Isles]] of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct [[Norn language]]. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as [[York]] (Horse Bay), [[Swansea]] ([[Sven|Sveinn]]'s Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like [[Tocqueville (disambiguation)|Tocqueville]] (Toki's farm).<ref>See [[Norman toponymy]].</ref>\n\n[[Linguistic]] and [[etymology|etymological]] studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.<ref>Henriksen, Louise K\u00e6mpe: [http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 Nordic place names in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032738/http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 |date=22 February 2014 }} Viking Ship Museum Roskilde</ref><ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html Viking Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203125117/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html |date=3 February 2007 }} The British Library</ref> A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].<ref>[http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ Department of Scandinavian Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084718/http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ |date=8 February 2014 }} University of Copenhagen</ref> Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the [[Slavic languages]] in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe.

There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the [[longship]].<ref>Longships are sometimes erroneously called ''drakkar'', a corruption of \"dragon\" in Norse.</ref> Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the [[Leidang]], the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to ''go Viking'', which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.<ref>Hadingham, Evan: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html Secrets of Viking Ships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912023933/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html |date=12 September 2017 }} (05.09.00) NOVA science media.</ref><ref>Durham, Keith: ''Viking Longship'' Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The ''[[knarr]]'' was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the '[[beitass]]', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.<ref>Block, Leo, [https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc ''To Harness the Wind: A Short History of the Development of Sails''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203825/https://books.google.com/books?id=ezgq0VnV5XQC&hl=en |date=1 January 2016 }}, Naval Institute Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-55750-209-9}}</ref> It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = VIKING LONGSHIP \"SEA STALLION\" ARRIVES IN DUBLIN.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Sea Stallion\n| caption1  = [[Sea Stallion (longship)|A reconstructed longship]]\n| image2    = Modell Knorr.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Knarr Haithabu\n| caption2  = A model of the ''knarr'' ship type\n| footer    = Two typical viking ships.\n}}\n\nShips were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at [[Gokstad]] and [[Oseberg]] in Norway<ref>Ian Heath, The Vikings, p. 4, Osprey Publishing, 1985.</ref> and the excavated ship burial at [[Ladby ship|Ladby]] in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the [[Salme ships]] on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |title=The First Vikings |magazine=Archaeology |publisher=the Archaeological Institute of America |first=Andrew |last=Curry |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228192503/http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |archive-date=28 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWell-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from [[Roskilde Fjord]] in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the ''knarr''. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect [[Roskilde]], then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the [[Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Everyday life===\n\n====Social structure====\n[[File:Reconstructed Viking House.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed Viking house in Iceland]]\n[[File:Viking house Ale Sweden.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed Viking Longhouse in Ale, north of Gothenburg [[Sweden]] ]]\n[[File:Chieftains house (reconstruction) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A large reconstructed chieftains longhouse at [[Lofotr Viking Museum]], Norway]]\n[[File:Busdorf - Haithabu - Wikinger-H\u00e4user 05 ies.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed town houses from [[Haithabu]] (now in Germany)]]\n\nViking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the [[Eddic poem]] of [[R\u00edgs\u00feula]], which also explains that it was the [[R\u00edg (Norse god)|God R\u00edg]]\u2014father of mankind also known as [[Heimdallr]]\u2014who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.<ref name=\"Roesdahl 38\">Roesdahl, pp. 38\u201348, 61\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[Thrall]]s were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Slaves comprised as much as a quarter of the population.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vikings may have first taken to seas to find women, slaves |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=15 April 2016 |access-date=1 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190115/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |archive-date=1 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Slavery was of vital importance to Viking society, for everyday chores and large scale construction and also to trade and the economy. Thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, to enslave them as thralls. The thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures, or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'tr\u00e6l' and 'ty'.\n\nKarls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men.\n\nThe Jarls were the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions. When a Jarl died and was buried, his household thralls were sometimes [[Human sacrifice in Germanic paganism|sacrificially killed]] and buried next to him, as many excavations have revealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|title=Double graves with headless slaves|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=23 June 2014|author=Mari Kildah|publisher=University of Oslo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011090033/http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|archive-date=11 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it is believed that there must have been some social mobility. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like ''hauldr'', ''thegn'', ''landmand'', show mobility between the Karls and the Jarls.\n\nOther social structures included the communities of ''f\u00e9lag'' in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called ''f\u00e9lagi'') were obliged. A f\u00e9lag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as ''drenge'', one of the words for warrior.

This included spear and stone throwing, building and testing physical strength through [[wrestling]] (see [[glima]]), [[fist fighting]], and stone lifting. In areas with mountains, [[mountain climbing]] was practised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport, and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship's railing as it was being rowed. [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] was a popular sport and [[Snorri Sturluson]] describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competition. King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and was said to have excelled in the art of [[knife juggling]] as well.\n\n[[Skiing]] and [[ice skating]] were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter and in the colder regions of the north.\n\nHorse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear. It appears to have involved two stallions pitted against each other, within smell and sight of fenced-off mares. Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions.\n\nIcelandic sources refer to the sport of ''[[knattleikr|knattleik]]''. A ball game akin to [[hockey]], knattleik involved a bat and a small hard ball and was usually played on a smooth field of ice. The rules are unclear, but it was popular with both adults and children, even though it often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.\n\nHunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation.

Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the [[Icelanders]] Snorri Sturluson and [[S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.\n\nThe 200-year Viking influence on [[History of Europe|European history]] is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]] chronicles, [[Novgorod]] chronicles, [[Ibn Fadlan]] chronicles, [[Ibn Rusta]] chronicles, and brief mentions by [[Photius]], patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other chroniclers of Viking history include [[Adam of Bremen]], who wrote, in the fourth volume of his ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'', \"[t]here is much gold here (in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called ''wichingi'' by their own people, and ''Ascomanni'' by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the [[Battle of Maldon]] between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.\n\n===Post-medieval perceptions===\n[[File:Vikings fight.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Combat reenactment|modern reenactment]] of a Viking battle]]\nEarly modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (''History of the northern people'') of [[Olaus Magnus]] (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century ''Gesta Danorum'' (''Deeds of the Danes''),  by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665).\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and the Swede [[Olaus Rudbeck]] used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]], who published his ''Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus'' (''Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages'') in 1703\u201305. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.\n\nThe word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] in his poem, ''The Viking''. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of [[Romanticism]] in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The [[Geatish Society]], of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of ''[[Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna]]'', which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n[[File:Viking Siege of Paris.jpg|thumb|Viking long ships [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieging Paris]] in 845, 19th century portrayal]]\nFascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called [[Viking revival]] in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of [[Romantic nationalism]]. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"[[Wagnerian]]\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries [[Scandinavism]]. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of the Germanic master race.<ref>[[William W. Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, p. 363</ref> Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in [[Nazi Germany]] as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of [[Nazi mysticism]]. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda.\n\n[[Soviet]] and earlier [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] historians emphasized a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ohloblyn |first1=Oleksander |title=Normanist Theory |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |accessdate=7 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907221348/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |archive-date=7 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives.

These have included novels directly based on historical events, such as [[Frans Gunnar Bengtsson]]'s ''[[The Long Ships]]'' (which was also released as a [[The Long Ships (1963 film)|1963 film]]), and historical fantasies such as the film ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'', [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' (movie version called ''[[The 13th Warrior]]''), and the comedy film ''[[Erik the Viking]]''. The vampire [[Eric Northman]], in the HBO TV series ''[[True Blood]]'', was a Viking prince before being turned into a vampire. Vikings appear in several books by the [[Danish American]] writer [[Poul Anderson]], while British explorer, historian, and writer [[Tim Severin]] authored a trilogy of novels in 2005 about a young Viking adventurer Thorgils Leifsson, who travels around the world.\n\nIn 1962, American comic book writer [[Stan Lee]] and his brother [[Larry Lieber]], together with [[Jack Kirby]], created the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], which they based on the Norse god of the same name. The character is featured in the 2011 [[Marvel Studios]] film [[Thor (film)|''Thor'']] and its sequels ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''. The character also appears in the 2012 film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and its associated [[Marvel's Avengers Assemble (TV series)|animated series]].\n\nThe appearance of Vikings within popular media and television has seen a resurgence in recent decades, especially with the History Channel's series [[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings (2013)]], directed by Michael Hirst. The show has a loose grounding in historical facts and sources, but bases itself more so on literary sources, such as [[Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok|fornaldarsaga Ragnars saga lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar]], itself more legend than fact, and Old Norse Eddic and Skaldic poetry.<ref>Gareth Lloyd Evans, \"Michael Hirst\u2019s Vikings and Old Norse Poetry\", ''Translating Early Medieval Poetry: Transformation, Reception, Interpretation''.

While the earliest groups had little claim for historical accuracy, the seriousness and accuracy of reenactors has increased.

This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture, while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into [[Scandinavia]] itself, with profound developmental implications in both directions. During the Viking Age the Norse homelands were gradually consolidated into three larger kingdoms, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The [[Normans]], descendants of Vikings who became rulers of [[Normandy]] which was named after them, also formed the aristocracy of England from the [[Norman conquest of England]].\n\nNorse civilisation during the Viking Age was technologically, military and culturally advanced. Yet popular, modern conceptions of the Vikings\u2014the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia\u2014often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from [[archaeology]] and historical sources, namely that of the advanced civilisation that Norsemen were.

The Old Norse feminine ''v\u00edking'' (as in the phrase ''fara \u00ed v\u00edking'') may originally have been a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey, because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A ''v\u00edkingr'' (the masculine) would then originally have been a participant on a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers. In that case, the word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians begun to dominate the seas.<ref name=\"Eldar Heide 2008 23\u201328\"/>\n\nIn [[Old English]], the word ''wicing'' appears first in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] poem, ''[[Widsith]]'', which probably dates from the 9th century. In Old English, and in the history of the archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Hamburg-Bremen]] written by [[Adam of Bremen]] in about 1070, the term generally referred to Scandinavian pirates or raiders. As in the Old Norse usages, the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general. The word does not occur in any preserved [[Middle English]] texts. One theory made by the [[Iceland]]er \u00d6rnolfur Kristjansson is that the key to the origins of the word is \"''wicinga cynn''\" in Widsith, referring to the people or the race living in [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] (York, in the ninth century under control by Norsemen), ''J\u00f3r-Wicings'' (note, however, that this is not the origin of ''J\u00f3rv\u00edk'').<ref name=\"arch in europe\">{{cite web|last=Beard |first=David |title=The Term \"Viking\" |url=http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |work=archeurope.com |publisher=Archaeology in Europe |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407050944/http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''Viking'' was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"[[barbarian]] warrior\" or [[noble savage]]. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer to not only seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), but also any member of the culture that produced said raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like ''Viking age'', ''Viking culture'', ''Viking art'', ''Viking religion'', ''Viking ship'' and so on.<ref name=\"arch in europe\"/>\n\nThe term \u201dViking\u201d that appeared in Northwestern Germanic sources in the Viking Age denoted pirates. According to some researchers, the term back then had no geographic or ethnic connotations that limited it to Scandinavia only. The term was instead used about anyone who to the Norse peoples appeared as a pirate. Therefore, the term had been used about Israelites on the Red Sea; Muslims encountering Scandinavians in the Mediterranean; Caucasian pirates encountering the famous Swedish Ingvar-Expedition, and Estonian pirates on the Baltic Sea. Thus the term \"Viking\" was supposedly never limited to a single ethnicity as such, but rather an activity.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/8906219/_Vikings_and_the_Viking_Age?email_work_card=title]</ref>\n\n===Other names===\n[[File:Europe 814.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Europe in 814.

The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |title=Viking expeditions and raids |publisher=National Museum of Denmark |accessdate=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172137/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |archive-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : a very short introduction|last=Richards|first=J.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea.

Kendrick]], ''A History of the Vikings'', Courier Dover Publications, 2004, pp. 179ff, {{ISBN|978-0-486-43396-7}}</ref>\n\n===End of the Viking Age===\nDuring the Viking Age, Scandinavian men and women travelled to many parts of Europe and beyond, in a cultural diaspora that left its traces from [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] to [[Byzantium]]. This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, which were subject to a variety of new influences.<ref>Roesdahl, pp. 295\u201397</ref> In the 300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia underwent profound cultural changes.\n\nBy the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the [[Catholic Church]] (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.<ref>Gareth Williams, \"Kingship, Christianity and coinage: monetary and political perspectives on silver economy in the Viking Age\", in ''Silver Economy in the Viking Age'', ed. [[James Graham-Campbell]] and Gareth Williams, pp.&nbsp;177\u2013214; {{ISBN|978-1-59874-222-0}}</ref> By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.<ref>Roesdahl, p. 296</ref>\n\n==== Assimilation into Christendom ====\n[[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianity had taken root]] in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at [[Lund]], Scania, then part of Denmark.\n\nThe assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so [[chattel slavery]] diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.\n\nThe kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, [[Sigurd I of Norway]] sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>The Northern Crusades: Second Edition by Eric Christiansen; {{ISBN|0-14-026653-4}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on [[runestone]]s. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|title=Written sources shed light on Viking travels|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172414/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|archive-date=18 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.<ref>Hall, 2010, pp. 8 ''passim''.</ref><ref>Roesdahl, pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices.\n\n===Literature and language===\n{{See also|Old Norse|The Norse Sagas }}\n[[File:Lbs fragm 82, 0001v - 1.jpg|thumb|One of the few surviving manuscript leaves from the [[Heimskringla Saga]]s, written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] c. 1260. The leaf tells of [[Olaf II of Norway|King \u00d3lafur]].]]\n\nThe most important [[primary sources]] on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.<ref>Hall, pp. 8\u201311</ref> Writing in [[Latin]] letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.<ref>Lindqvist, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in [[runes]], but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.\n\nLater writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval [[Christian culture]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the [[Saga|Icelandic sagas]]. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of [[skald]]ic poetry attributed to [[Poet laureate|court poets]] of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.\n\nIndirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like [[Egilsay]] (from ''Eigils ey'' meaning Eigil's Island), [[Ormskirk]] (from ''Ormr kirkja'' meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), [[Meols]] (from ''merl'' meaning Sand Dunes), [[Snaefell]] (Snow Fell), [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] (Ravens Rock), [[Vinland]] (Land of Wine or Land of [[Winberry]]), [[Kaupanger]] (Market Harbour), [[T\u00f3rshavn]] (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of [[Odense]], meaning a place where [[Odin]] was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the [[Tynwald]] on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nCommon words in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays ([[Thursday]] means Thor's day), [[wikt:axle|axle]], [[wikt:crook|crook]], [[wikt:raft|raft]], [[wikt:knife|knife]], [[wikt:plough|plough]], [[wikt:leather|leather]], [[wikt:window|window]], [[berserker|berserk]], [[bylaw]], [[thorp]], [[skerry]], [[wikt:husband|husband]], {{linktext|heathen}}, [[Hel (being)|Hell]], [[Normans|Norman]] and [[wikt:ransack|ransack]] stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give us an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.<ref>See [[List of English words of Old Norse origin]] for further explanations on specific words.</ref> In the [[Northern Isles]] of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct [[Norn language]]. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as [[York]] (Horse Bay), [[Swansea]] ([[Sven|Sveinn]]'s Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like [[Tocqueville (disambiguation)|Tocqueville]] (Toki's farm).<ref>See [[Norman toponymy]].</ref>\n\n[[Linguistic]] and [[etymology|etymological]] studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.<ref>Henriksen, Louise K\u00e6mpe: [http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 Nordic place names in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032738/http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 |date=22 February 2014 }} Viking Ship Museum Roskilde</ref><ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html Viking Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203125117/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html |date=3 February 2007 }} The British Library</ref> A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].<ref>[http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ Department of Scandinavian Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084718/http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ |date=8 February 2014 }} University of Copenhagen</ref> Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the [[Slavic languages]] in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe.

There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the [[longship]].<ref>Longships are sometimes erroneously called ''drakkar'', a corruption of \"dragon\" in Norse.</ref> Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the [[Leidang]], the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to ''go Viking'', which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.<ref>Hadingham, Evan: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html Secrets of Viking Ships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912023933/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html |date=12 September 2017 }} (05.09.00) NOVA science media.</ref><ref>Durham, Keith: ''Viking Longship'' Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The ''[[knarr]]'' was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the '[[beitass]]', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.<ref>Block, Leo, [https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc ''To Harness the Wind: A Short History of the Development of Sails''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203825/https://books.google.com/books?id=ezgq0VnV5XQC&hl=en |date=1 January 2016 }}, Naval Institute Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-55750-209-9}}</ref> It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = VIKING LONGSHIP \"SEA STALLION\" ARRIVES IN DUBLIN.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Sea Stallion\n| caption1  = [[Sea Stallion (longship)|A reconstructed longship]]\n| image2    = Modell Knorr.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Knarr Haithabu\n| caption2  = A model of the ''knarr'' ship type\n| footer    = Two typical viking ships.\n}}\n\nShips were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at [[Gokstad]] and [[Oseberg]] in Norway<ref>Ian Heath, The Vikings, p. 4, Osprey Publishing, 1985.</ref> and the excavated ship burial at [[Ladby ship|Ladby]] in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the [[Salme ships]] on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |title=The First Vikings |magazine=Archaeology |publisher=the Archaeological Institute of America |first=Andrew |last=Curry |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228192503/http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |archive-date=28 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWell-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from [[Roskilde Fjord]] in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the ''knarr''. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect [[Roskilde]], then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the [[Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Everyday life===\n\n====Social structure====\n[[File:Reconstructed Viking House.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed Viking house in Iceland]]\n[[File:Viking house Ale Sweden.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed Viking Longhouse in Ale, north of Gothenburg [[Sweden]] ]]\n[[File:Chieftains house (reconstruction) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A large reconstructed chieftains longhouse at [[Lofotr Viking Museum]], Norway]]\n[[File:Busdorf - Haithabu - Wikinger-H\u00e4user 05 ies.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed town houses from [[Haithabu]] (now in Germany)]]\n\nViking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the [[Eddic poem]] of [[R\u00edgs\u00feula]], which also explains that it was the [[R\u00edg (Norse god)|God R\u00edg]]\u2014father of mankind also known as [[Heimdallr]]\u2014who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.<ref name=\"Roesdahl 38\">Roesdahl, pp. 38\u201348, 61\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[Thrall]]s were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Slaves comprised as much as a quarter of the population.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vikings may have first taken to seas to find women, slaves |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=15 April 2016 |access-date=1 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190115/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |archive-date=1 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Slavery was of vital importance to Viking society, for everyday chores and large scale construction and also to trade and the economy. Thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, to enslave them as thralls. The thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures, or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'tr\u00e6l' and 'ty'.\n\nKarls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men.\n\nThe Jarls were the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions. When a Jarl died and was buried, his household thralls were sometimes [[Human sacrifice in Germanic paganism|sacrificially killed]] and buried next to him, as many excavations have revealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|title=Double graves with headless slaves|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=23 June 2014|author=Mari Kildah|publisher=University of Oslo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011090033/http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|archive-date=11 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it is believed that there must have been some social mobility. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like ''hauldr'', ''thegn'', ''landmand'', show mobility between the Karls and the Jarls.\n\nOther social structures included the communities of ''f\u00e9lag'' in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called ''f\u00e9lagi'') were obliged. A f\u00e9lag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as ''drenge'', one of the words for warrior. There were also official communities within towns and villages, the overall defence, religion, the legal system and the [[Thing (assembly)|Things]].\n\n====Women====\nWomen had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic [[Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s]] and the Norwegian [[Frostating]] laws and [[Gulating]] laws.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Borgstr\u00f6m Eva {{in lang|sv}}: Makal\u00f6sa kvinnor: k\u00f6ns\u00f6verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.).

Almost all of the jewellery was crafted in specific designs unique to the Norse (see [[Viking art]]). Finger rings were seldom used and earrings were not used at all, as they were seen as a [[Slavic people|Slavic]] phenomenon.

This included spear and stone throwing, building and testing physical strength through [[wrestling]] (see [[glima]]), [[fist fighting]], and stone lifting. In areas with mountains, [[mountain climbing]] was practised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport, and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship's railing as it was being rowed. [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] was a popular sport and [[Snorri Sturluson]] describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competition. King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and was said to have excelled in the art of [[knife juggling]] as well.\n\n[[Skiing]] and [[ice skating]] were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter and in the colder regions of the north.\n\nHorse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear. It appears to have involved two stallions pitted against each other, within smell and sight of fenced-off mares. Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions.\n\nIcelandic sources refer to the sport of ''[[knattleikr|knattleik]]''. A ball game akin to [[hockey]], knattleik involved a bat and a small hard ball and was usually played on a smooth field of ice. The rules are unclear, but it was popular with both adults and children, even though it often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.\n\nHunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation. Birds, [[deer]], [[hare]]s and [[fox]]es were hunted with bow and spear, and later with crossbows. The techniques were stalking, snare and traps and ''[[par force]]'' hunting with dog packs.\n\n====Games and entertainment====\n[[File:Beserker, Lewis Chessmen, British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rook, [[Lewis chessmen]], at the British Museum in London]]\nBoth archaeological finds and written sources testify to the fact that the Vikings set aside time for social and festive gatherings.<ref name=KWolf/><ref name=SportsGames/><ref name=NatMus>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-people/games-and-entertainment/|title=Games and entertainment in the Viking period|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502075927/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-people/games-and-entertainment/|archive-date=2 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoard games and dice games were played as a popular pastime at all levels of society.

This trade satisfied the Vikings' need for leather and meat to some extent, and perhaps hides for [[parchment]] production on the European mainland. Wool was also very important as a domestic product for the Vikings, to produce warm clothing for the cold Scandinavian and Nordic climate, and for sails. Sails for Viking ships required large amounts of wool, as evidenced by experimental archaeology. There are archaeological signs of organised textile productions in Scandinavia, reaching as far back as the early [[Nordic Iron Age|Iron Ages]].

The devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen,\" declared the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]].<ref>English Historical Documents, c. 500\u20131042 by Dorothy Whitelock; p. 776</ref> Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".<ref>Derry (2012).

Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the [[Icelanders]] Snorri Sturluson and [[S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.\n\nThe 200-year Viking influence on [[History of Europe|European history]] is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]] chronicles, [[Novgorod]] chronicles, [[Ibn Fadlan]] chronicles, [[Ibn Rusta]] chronicles, and brief mentions by [[Photius]], patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other chroniclers of Viking history include [[Adam of Bremen]], who wrote, in the fourth volume of his ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'', \"[t]here is much gold here (in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called ''wichingi'' by their own people, and ''Ascomanni'' by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the [[Battle of Maldon]] between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.\n\n===Post-medieval perceptions===\n[[File:Vikings fight.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Combat reenactment|modern reenactment]] of a Viking battle]]\nEarly modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (''History of the northern people'') of [[Olaus Magnus]] (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century ''Gesta Danorum'' (''Deeds of the Danes''),  by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665).\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and the Swede [[Olaus Rudbeck]] used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]], who published his ''Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus'' (''Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages'') in 1703\u201305. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.\n\nThe word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] in his poem, ''The Viking''. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of [[Romanticism]] in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The [[Geatish Society]], of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of ''[[Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna]]'', which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n[[File:Viking Siege of Paris.jpg|thumb|Viking long ships [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieging Paris]] in 845, 19th century portrayal]]\nFascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called [[Viking revival]] in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of [[Romantic nationalism]]. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"[[Wagnerian]]\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries [[Scandinavism]]. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by [[Richard Wagner]]. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of the Germanic master race.<ref>[[William W. Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, p. 363</ref> Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in [[Nazi Germany]] as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of [[Nazi mysticism]]. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda.\n\n[[Soviet]] and earlier [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] historians emphasized a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ohloblyn |first1=Oleksander |title=Normanist Theory |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |accessdate=7 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907221348/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |archive-date=7 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives.

The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side.\n\nHistorians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven. The general misconception that Viking warriors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the 19th-century enthusiasts of ''[[Geatish Society|G\u00f6tiska F\u00f6rbundet]]'', founded in 1811 in [[Stockholm]].<ref name=\"Frank\">{{cite book |last=Frank |first=Roberta |title=International Scandinavian and Medieval Studies in Memory of Gerd Wolfgang Weber |year=2000 |publisher=Ed.

This was done to legitimise the Vikings and their mythology by associating it with the Classical world, which had long been idealised in European culture.\n\nThe latter-day ''mythos'' created by [[National Romanticism|national romantic ideas]] blended the Viking Age with aspects of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] some 2,000 years earlier. Horned helmets from the Bronze Age were shown in [[petroglyph]]s and appeared in archaeological finds (see [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] and [[Vikso]] helmets).

While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers a series of payments made for the same death. Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax ([[Terry Kiser]]), who commends them for discovering [[insurance fraud]] and invites them to his [[Hamptons]], [[Long Island]], beach house for the [[Labor Day]] weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his [[American Mafia|mob]] partner Vito ([[Louis Giambalvo]]), Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed. However, after Bernie leaves, Vito decides Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his greed and his relationship with Vito's girlfriend, Tina ([[Catherine Parks]]), and orders that he be killed instead.\n\nBernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and plans the murders with Paulie ([[Don Calfa]]), the hitman, on the phone, unaware the conversation is being recorded on his [[answering machine]]. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives and kills Bernie with a [[heroin]] overdose. When Larry and Richard arrive at Bernie's house, they are shocked to find Bernie's body. Before they can call the police, guests arrive for a party that Bernie used to host every weekend. To Larry and Richard's amazement, the guests are too engrossed in their partying to notice he is dead, with the dopey grin from the fatal injection and his sunglasses concealing his lifeless state. Fearing implication in Bernie's death, and wanting to enjoy the luxury of the house for the weekend, Larry proposes he and Richard maintain the illusion that Bernie is still alive, a notion that Richard finds absurd. Only the arrival of Richard's office crush, Gwen Saunders ([[Catherine Mary Stewart]]), a summer [[Internship|intern]] for the company, convinces him to go along with Larry's plan.\n\nLater that night, Tina arrives at the house, and has Larry and Richard direct her to Bernie. There, she also fails to realize he is dead. At that moment, Marty, one of Vito's mobsters witnesses the two of them apparently making love. Fooled into thinking Bernie's assassination failed, he notifies Vito. The next morning, Richard is appalled to discover Larry furthering the illusion of Bernie being alive by manipulating his body's limbs. Richard attempts to call the police but instead activates the phone message detailing Bernie's plot against them. Unaware of the circumstances of Bernie's death, they mistakenly believe they are still the targets of a mob hit and decide to use Bernie's corpse as a prop for protection. Richard and Larry make various attempts to leave the island. All attempts are thwarted, as they repeatedly misplace and recover Bernie's body. Finally, Larry and Richard are forced to return to Bernie's home. Meanwhile, Paulie, unhinged by his apparent failure to kill Bernie, returns to the island.\n\nAt the house, Gwen confronts Larry and Richard, who confess that Bernie has been dead since their arrival. Paulie then appears and opens fire at Bernie, then turns his attention to Larry, Richard, and Gwen. Chasing after the trio, Paulie corners Larry, who clumsily manages to subdue him with a phone cord and a punch. The police eventually arrive and place Paulie under arrest, taking him away in a [[straitjacket]] as he continues to insist Bernie is still alive. Bernie is loaded into an ambulance, however, his gurney rolls away and topples off the boardwalk, dumping him onto the beach right behind Richard, Larry, and Gwen, who run away after noticing him. Eventually, a young boy comes along and starts scooping buckets of sand over the body, burying Bernie.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Lawrence \"Larry\" Wilson\n* [[Jonathan Silverman]] as Richard Parker\n* [[Terry Kiser]] as Bernie Lomax\n* [[Catherine Mary Stewart]] as Gwen Saunders\n* [[Don Calfa]] as Paulie\n* [[Catherine Parks]] as Tina\n* [[Eloise Broady DeJoria|Eloise Broady]] as Tawny\n* Gregory Salata as Marty\n* [[Louis Giambalvo]] as Vito\n* [[Ted Kotcheff]] as Mr. Parker\n* Margaret Hall as Lomax's secretary\n* [[Jason Woliner]] as Bratty kid\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds a 54% approval rating based on 24 reviews.
