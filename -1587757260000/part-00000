He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, [[harpsichord]], and other instruments on their recordings. He co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of ''The Monkees'', \"For Pete's Sake\".

In it, Nesmith states that Tork was better at playing guitar than bass. In Tork's commentary, he states that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.\n\nRecording and producing as a group was Tork's major interest, and he hoped that the four members would continue working together as a band on future recordings. However, the four did not have enough in common regarding their musical interests. In commentary for the DVD release of the second season of the show, Tork said that Dolenz was \"incapable of repeating a triumph.\" Dolenz felt that once he had accomplished something and became a success at it, there was no artistic sense in repeating a formula.\n[[File:Davy Jones Peter Tork The Monkees 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Jones and Tork, 1966]]\nTork, once free from [[Don Kirshner]]'s restrictions, in 1967, contributed some of the most memorable and catchy instrumental flourishes,{{According to whom|date=February 2019}} such as the piano introduction to \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" and the banjo part on [[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|\"You Told Me\"]], as well as exploring occasional songwriting with the likes of \"For Pete's Sake\" and \"Lady's Baby\".\n\nTork was close to his maternal grandmother, Catherine McGuire Straus, staying with her sometimes in his Greenwich Village days, and after he became a Monkee. \"Grams\" was one of his most ardent supporters and managed his [[fan club]], often writing personal letters to members, and visiting music stores to make sure they carried Monkees records.\n\nSix albums were produced with the original Monkees lineup, four of which went to No.&nbsp;1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart.

Tork attended Windham High School in [[Willimantic, Connecticut]], and was a member of the first graduating class at [[E. O. Smith High School]] in [[Storrs, Connecticut]]. He attended [[Carleton College]] before he moved to New York City, where he became part of the [[folk music]] scene in [[Greenwich Village]] during the first half of the 1960s. While there, he befriended other up-and-coming musicians such as Stephen Stills.\n\n==The Monkees==\n[[File:The Monkees May 1967.jpg|thumb|350px|Tork (right) with [[The Monkees]] in 1966|alt=|left]]\nStephen Stills had auditioned for the new television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers felt his hair and teeth were not photogenic.<ref>Peter Tork speaking in a July 12, 2013 phone interview with Roger Friedensen, a correspondent for ''[[The News & Observer]]'' in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].</ref> When asked if he knew of someone with a similar \"open, Nordic look\", Stills suggested Tork should audition.<ref>Zimmer, Dave.

Tork was the oldest member of the group.\n\nTork was a proficient musician before he joined The Monkees, and though other members of the group were not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he had played what he described as \"third chair guitar\" on [[Michael Nesmith]]'s song \"Papa Gene's Blues\" on their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, [[harpsichord]], and other instruments on their recordings. He co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of ''The Monkees'', \"For Pete's Sake\". On the show, he was relegated to acting as the \"lovable dummy\", a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in New York's Greenwich Village.<ref>[http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-michael-nesmith-micky-dolenz-and-peter-tork-talk-monkees-summer-tour-headquarters-and-what-they-learned-jimi-hendrix \"Interview: Michael Nesmith, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork Talk Monkees Summer Tour, 'Headquarters' and What They Learned from Jimi Hendrix\"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116000401/http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-michael-nesmith-micky-dolenz-and-peter-tork-talk-monkees-summer-tour-headquarters-and-what-they-learned-jimi-hendrix |date=November 16, 2015 }} ''Guitar World'', July 26, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe DVD release of the first season of the show contains commentary from the various bandmates. In it, Nesmith states that Tork was better at playing guitar than bass. In Tork's commentary, he states that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.\n\nRecording and producing as a group was Tork's major interest, and he hoped that the four members would continue working together as a band on future recordings. However, the four did not have enough in common regarding their musical interests. In commentary for the DVD release of the second season of the show, Tork said that Dolenz was \"incapable of repeating a triumph.\" Dolenz felt that once he had accomplished something and became a success at it, there was no artistic sense in repeating a formula.\n[[File:Davy Jones Peter Tork The Monkees 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Jones and Tork, 1966]]\nTork, once free from [[Don Kirshner]]'s restrictions, in 1967, contributed some of the most memorable and catchy instrumental flourishes,{{According to whom|date=February 2019}} such as the piano introduction to \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" and the banjo part on [[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|\"You Told Me\"]], as well as exploring occasional songwriting with the likes of \"For Pete's Sake\" and \"Lady's Baby\".\n\nTork was close to his maternal grandmother, Catherine McGuire Straus, staying with her sometimes in his Greenwich Village days, and after he became a Monkee. \"Grams\" was one of his most ardent supporters and managed his [[fan club]], often writing personal letters to members, and visiting music stores to make sure they carried Monkees records.\n\nSix albums were produced with the original Monkees lineup, four of which went to No.&nbsp;1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart. This success was supplemented by two years of the television program, a series of successful concert tours both across America and abroad, and a trippy-psychedelic movie, ''[[Head (film)|Head]]'', which is considered by some to have been a bit ahead of its time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/769-america-lost-and-found-the-bbs-story |title=America Lost and Found: The BBS Story |work=The Criterion Channel |access-date=February 21, 2019 |quote=A constantly looping, self-referential spoof that was ahead of its time, Head dodged commercial success on its release but has since been reclaimed as one of the great cult objects of its era. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222151919/https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/769-america-lost-and-found-the-bbs-story |archive-date=February 22, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, tensions, both musical and personal, were increasing within the group.

Tork kept the back, but replaced the watch several times in later years. Jones noted at the time that \"Peter's soul left us two and a half years ago. He was a banjo player from Greenwich Village who was made into an actor and finally decided that he didn't want to be a [[The Marx Brothers|Marx Brother]] forever. His heart was back in the Village, that's all.\"<ref name=baker/> Dolenz reflected on Tork's departure as well, saying \"Three of us more or less play ourselves in the series. The odd one out is Peter Tork. Offstage he's a real serious guy who thinks a lot about things like religion and problems in the world. But in the show he throws off all that and becomes a dumb-but-likable character who is always doing the wrong thing at the wrong time.

The four other tracks were \"Good Looker,\" \"Since You Went Away\", which appeared on the Monkees 1987 album ''[[Pool It!]]'', \"[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]\" and \"Hi Hi Babe.\" Also present at the sessions were [[Joan Jett]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], and [[Tommy Ramone]]. The tracks were recorded at Blue Horizon House, 165 [[West 74th Street]], home of Sire Records, but [[Seymour Stein]], president of Sire, rejected the demo, stating \"there's nothing there.\" Tork recorded a second set of demos in New York City, but little is known about these, other than the fact that one track was a yet another version of \"[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]\" with an unknown rock band, and featured a violin solo.\n\nDuring this time, Tork appeared regularly on ''[[Floyd Vivino|The Uncle Floyd Show]]'' broadcast on U-68 out of New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blip.tv/file/4497948 |title=Peter Tork 6 of 8 on The Strange Dave Show |publisher=Blip.tv |access-date=August 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707035632/http://blip.tv/file/4497948 |archivedate=July 7, 2012 }}</ref> He performed comedy bits and lip-synced the Sire recordings.

A decade later, all four group members recorded ''[[Justus (album)|Justus]]'', the first recording with all four members since 1968. The quartet performed live in the United Kingdom in 1997, but for the next several years only the trio of Tork, Dolenz and Jones toured together. The trio of Monkees parted ways in 2001 with a public feud; but, reunited in 2011 for a series of 45th&nbsp;anniversary concerts in England and the United States.\n\nSince 1986, Tork had intermittently toured with his former bandmates and also played with his own bands '''The Peter Tork Project''' and '''Shoe Suede Blues'''.

The duo followed up in 2001 with a second release, ''Once Again''.\n\nIn 2001, Tork took time out from touring to appear in a leading role in the short film ''Mixed Signals'', written and directed by John Graziano.\n\nIn 2002, Tork resumed working with his band Shoe Suede Blues. The band performed original blues music, Monkees covers (blues versions of some), and covers of classic blues hits by greats such as [[Muddy Waters]] and shared the stage with bands such as Captain Zig.

Traditionally, when at war the Romans would raise two [[Roman legion|legions]], each of 4,200 infantry{{#tag:ref|This could be increased to 5,000 in some circumstances.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=23}}|group=note}} and 300 cavalry. A small number of the infantry served as [[javelin]]-armed [[velites|skirmishers]]. The balance were equipped as [[heavy infantry]], with [[Body armor|body armour]], a large [[Scutum (shield)|shield]], and [[Gladius|short thrusting swords]]. They were divided into three ranks, of which the [[hastati|front rank]] also carried two javelins, while the [[principes|second]] and [[triari|third]] ranks had a [[Hasta (spear)|thrusting spear]] instead. Both legionary [[Maniple (military unit)|sub-units]] and individual [[legionary|legionaries]] fought in relatively open order. It was the long-standing Roman procedure to appoint two men each year, known as [[Roman consul|consuls]], to each lead an army. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their [[Socii|Latin allies]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nCarthaginian citizens only served in their army if there was a direct threat to the city of Carthage. In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many would be from North Africa which provided several types of fighters including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; javelin-armed [[light infantry]] [[skirmisher]]s; close-order [[Shock tactics|shock cavalry]] carrying spears; and [[light cavalry]] skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Both Spain and [[Gaul]] provided small numbers of experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{#tag:ref|The Spanish used a heavy throwing spear which the Romans were later to adopt as the ''[[pilum]]''.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}|group=note}} The close-order African infantry would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a [[phalanx]].{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} [[Sling (weapon)|Slingers]] were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=8}} The Carthaginians also employed [[war elephant]]s; North Africa had indigenous [[African forest elephant]]s at the time.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=27}}{{#tag:ref|These elephants were typically about {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid|-high}} at the shoulder, and should not be confused with the larger [[African bush elephant]].{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=240}}|group=note}}\n\n==Background==\n===Start of the war===\n\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nThe [[Roman Republic]] had been [[Roman expansion in Italy|aggressively expanding]] in the southern Italian mainland for a century before the First Punic War.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=157\u2013158}} It had conquered peninsular Italy south of the River [[Arno]] by 272 BC.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=21\u201322}} During this period [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], with its capital in what is now [[Tunisia]], had come to dominate southern [[Spain]], much of the coastal regions of [[North Africa]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], and the western half of [[Sicily]] in a military and commercial empire.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=29\u201330}} In 264 BC Carthage and Rome were the preeminent powers in the western Mediterranean.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=25\u201326}} In 264 BC the two cities went to war over the city of Messana (modern [[Messina, Italy|Messina]]) in the north-eastern tip of Sicily.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=165}}\n\nMuch of the war was to be fought on, or in the waters near, Sicily. Away from the coasts its hilly and rugged terrain made manoeuvring large forces difficult and favoured the defence over the offence. Land operations were largely confined to [[Raid (military)|raid]]s, [[siege]]s and [[interdiction]]. Garrison duty and land [[blockade]]s were the most common operations for both armies; only two full-scale [[pitched battle]]s were fought on Sicily during the 23-year-long war; Panormus was one of these.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} After several Roman successes{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=65}} the war on Sicily reached a stalemate, as the Carthaginians focused on defending their well-fortified towns and cities; these were mostly on the coast and so could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=97}}\n\n===Invasion of Africa===\n\nThe focus of the war shifted to the sea.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=66}} The Romans won naval victories at Mylae and Sulci, and their frustration at the continuing stalemate in Sicily led them to develop a plan to invade the Carthaginian heartland in North Africa and threaten the city of Carthage (close to modern [[Tunis]]).{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=155}} After defeating the Carthaginians at the [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus]], possibly the largest naval battle in history by the number of combatants involved,{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=110\u2013111}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=87}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=436}} the Roman army landed in Africa on the [[Cape Bon|Cape Bon Peninsula]] and began ravaging the Carthaginian countryside.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=176}}\n\nMost of the Roman ships returned to Sicily, leaving 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to continue the war in Africa. A Carthaginian army which was strong in cavalry and elephants and was approximately the same size as the Romans' was defeated after the Carthaginians positioned it on a rocky hill and the [[Battle of Adys|Roman infantry stormed it]]. The Carthaginian's losses are unknown, although their elephants and cavalry escaped with few casualties.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=85\u201386}} The Carthaginians gave charge of the training of their army to the [[Sparta]]n mercenary commander [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]].{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=188}} In early 255 BC Xanthippus led an army of 12,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 100 elephants against 15,500 Romans, offered battle to them on an open plain, and decisively defeated them at the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|Battle of Tunis]]. The elephants played a prominent part in this victory. Approximately 2,000 Romans retreated to Aspis; 500 were captured; 13,000 were killed. The Romans evacuated the survivors by sea, but the Roman fleet was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, with 384 ships sunk from their total of 464 and 100,000 men lost{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=438}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=189}}{{snd}}the majority non-Roman Latin allies.{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=66}}\n\n== Prelude ==\n[[File:Sicilia - prima guerra punica.svg|thumb|left|alt=A relief map of Sicily showing the main cities at the time of the First Punic War|{{center|Sicily, the main theatre of the war}}]]\n\nHaving lost most of their fleet in the storm of 255 BC, the Romans rapidly rebuilt it, adding 220 new ships,{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=189\u2013190}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=114}} and launched a determined offensive in Sicily. Their entire fleet, under both consuls, attacked Panormus early in 254 BC.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=80}} Panormus was a large-for-the-time city on the north coast of Sicily, the site of the modern Sicilian capital [[Palermo]].{{#tag:ref|The classicist John Lazenby suggests that Panormus's outer town was on the site of modern Cassaro, and the inner town on that of [[Kalsa]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=115\u2013116}}|group=note}} It had a population of approximately 70,000 and was one of the largest Sicilian cities still loyal to Carthage and the most important economically.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=92}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=79}} The city's prosperity was based on trade and fishing, and due to the unusual lack of agriculture the area immediately around the city was thickly forested, even close to the gates.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=79}} The city was surrounded and blockaded, and siege engines set up. These made a breach in the walls which the Romans stormed, capturing the outer town and giving [[no quarter]]. The inner town promptly surrendered. The 14,000 inhabitants who could afford it [[ransom]]ed themselves and the remaining 13,000 were sold into slavery.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=80}}\n\nMuch of western inland Sicily now went over to the Romans: [[Ietas]], [[Solous]], Petra, and [[Tyndaris]] all came to [[peace|terms]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=80}} In 252 BC the Romans captured Thermae and Lipara, which had been isolated by the fall of Panormus.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=559}} In late 253 BC or early 252 BC Carthaginian reinforcements were sent to Sicily, under [[Hasdrubal, son of Hanno|Hasdrubal]], who had taken part in the two battles against the Romans in Africa.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=80}} The Romans avoided battle in 252 and 251 BC; according to Polybius because they feared the war elephants which the Carthaginians had shipped to Sicily.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=118}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=159}} The historian Nigel Bagnall suggests that survivors of the battle against Xanthippe passed on \"horrific stories\" of the effectiveness of the Carthaginian cavalry and elephants in open battle. In consequence the Carthaginians, probably with a smaller army than the Romans, dominated the plains; while the Romans stayed on higher and broken ground, where much of the effect of the cavalry and elephants would have been nullified. Both sides declined to face the other on their favoured terrain.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=82}}\n\n== Battle ==\n\nIn late summer 250 BC{{sfn|Morgan|1972|pp=121, 129}} Hasdrubal, hearing that one consul had left Sicily with half of the Roman army, marched out from the major Carthaginian stronghold of Lilybaeum towards Panormus with 30,000 men and between 60 and 142 elephants.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=120\u2013121}} Halting some distance away, he devastated the harvest in the territories of Rome's newly allied cities, in an attempt to provoke the Roman commander, [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (died 221 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]], into battle.{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=159}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=559}} The Roman troops amounted to two legions,{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=559}} and they had been dispersed to gather the harvest. Metellus withdrew them in front of the advancing Carthaginians and they retreated into Panormus. Encouraged by this by now expected timidity, Hasdrubal advanced down the [[Oreto River|Oreto valley]], continuing to despoil the countryside. The Oreto reached the sea immediately south of Panormus, and once there Hasdubal ordered part of his army to cross the river and advance up to the city wall.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=120}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=83}}\n\nOnce the elephants had crossed, or were crossing, the river, Metellus sent his light infantry to skirmish with the Carthaginians and impede their passage. These light troops hurled javelins at the Carthaginians, and had been instructed to concentrate on their elephants. Panormus was a major supply depot, and townspeople were employed in carrying bundles of javelins from stocks within the city to the foot of the walls so that the Roman skirmishers were constantly resupplied.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=120}} The ground between the river and the city was covered with [[earthworks (military)|earthworks]], some constructed during the Roman siege and some part of the city's defensive works, which made it difficult for the elephants to advance, or even manoeuvre. The elephants' [[mahout]]s, eager to demonstrate their charges' prowess, nevertheless drove them forward. Some accounts also have missiles being hurled down from the city walls at them. Peppered with missiles and unable to retaliate, the elephants fled through the Carthaginian infantry behind them.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=83}}\n\n[[File:C._Caecilius_Metellus_Caprarius,_denarius,_125_BC,_RRC_269-1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Denarius]] of [[Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius|C.

From here Metellus fed fresh troops into the large-scale skirmish under the city walls. When the elephants broke, disorganising a large part of the Carthaginian army, and demoralising all of it, Metellus ordered an attack on its left flank. The Carthaginians fled; those who attempted to fight were cut down. Metellus did not permit a pursuit, but did capture ten elephants in the immediate aftermath and, according to some accounts, the rest of the surviving animals over the succeeding days.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=83}}\n\nContemporary accounts do not report the other losses of either side, although the Carthaginians' are thought to have been heavy. Modern historians consider later claims of 20,000\u201330,000 Carthaginian casualties improbable.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=93\u201394}} Similarly, later accounts that the large Celtic contingent in the Carthaginian army were drunk when the battle began are usually dismissed; as is the suggestion that Carthaginian fleet took part in the operation, causing heavy casualties when many fleeing soldiers ran into the sea hoping to be taken off by their ships.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=121}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=94}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe defeat, and especially the loss of the elephants, resulted in the Romans feeling freer to manoeuvre on the plains, and the Carthaginians no longer being willing to challenge them.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=190}} As was the Carthaginian custom after a defeat, Hasdrubal was recalled to Carthage to be executed.{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=160}} His successor, Adhubal, decided that the large fortified city of Selinus could no longer be garrisoned and had the town destroyed.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=83}} Encouraged by their victory at Panormus, the Romans moved against the main Carthaginian base on Sicily, Lilybaeum, in 249 BC.

A Carthaginian army which was strong in cavalry and elephants and was approximately the same size as the Romans' was defeated after the Carthaginians positioned it on a rocky hill and the [[Battle of Adys|Roman infantry stormed it]]. The Carthaginian's losses are unknown, although their elephants and cavalry escaped with few casualties.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=85\u201386}} The Carthaginians gave charge of the training of their army to the [[Sparta]]n mercenary commander [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]].{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=188}} In early 255 BC Xanthippus led an army of 12,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 100 elephants against 15,500 Romans, offered battle to them on an open plain, and decisively defeated them at the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|Battle of Tunis]]. The elephants played a prominent part in this victory. Approximately 2,000 Romans retreated to Aspis; 500 were captured; 13,000 were killed. The Romans evacuated the survivors by sea, but the Roman fleet was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, with 384 ships sunk from their total of 464 and 100,000 men lost{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=438}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=189}}{{snd}}the majority non-Roman Latin allies.{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=66}}\n\n== Prelude ==\n[[File:Sicilia - prima guerra punica.svg|thumb|left|alt=A relief map of Sicily showing the main cities at the time of the First Punic War|{{center|Sicily, the main theatre of the war}}]]\n\nHaving lost most of their fleet in the storm of 255 BC, the Romans rapidly rebuilt it, adding 220 new ships,{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=189\u2013190}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=114}} and launched a determined offensive in Sicily. Their entire fleet, under both consuls, attacked Panormus early in 254 BC.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=80}} Panormus was a large-for-the-time city on the north coast of Sicily, the site of the modern Sicilian capital [[Palermo]].{{#tag:ref|The classicist John Lazenby suggests that Panormus's outer town was on the site of modern Cassaro, and the inner town on that of [[Kalsa]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=115\u2013116}}|group=note}} It had a population of approximately 70,000 and was one of the largest Sicilian cities still loyal to Carthage and the most important economically.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=92}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=79}} The city's prosperity was based on trade and fishing, and due to the unusual lack of agriculture the area immediately around the city was thickly forested, even close to the gates.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=79}} The city was surrounded and blockaded, and siege engines set up. These made a breach in the walls which the Romans stormed, capturing the outer town and giving [[no quarter]]. The inner town promptly surrendered. The 14,000 inhabitants who could afford it [[ransom]]ed themselves and the remaining 13,000 were sold into slavery.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=80}}\n\nMuch of western inland Sicily now went over to the Romans: [[Ietas]], [[Solous]], Petra, and [[Tyndaris]] all came to [[peace|terms]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=80}} In 252 BC the Romans captured Thermae and Lipara, which had been isolated by the fall of Panormus.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=559}} In late 253 BC or early 252 BC Carthaginian reinforcements were sent to Sicily, under [[Hasdrubal, son of Hanno|Hasdrubal]], who had taken part in the two battles against the Romans in Africa.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=80}} The Romans avoided battle in 252 and 251 BC; according to Polybius because they feared the war elephants which the Carthaginians had shipped to Sicily.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=118}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=159}} The historian Nigel Bagnall suggests that survivors of the battle against Xanthippe passed on \"horrific stories\" of the effectiveness of the Carthaginian cavalry and elephants in open battle. In consequence the Carthaginians, probably with a smaller army than the Romans, dominated the plains; while the Romans stayed on higher and broken ground, where much of the effect of the cavalry and elephants would have been nullified. Both sides declined to face the other on their favoured terrain.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=82}}\n\n== Battle ==\n\nIn late summer 250 BC{{sfn|Morgan|1972|pp=121, 129}} Hasdrubal, hearing that one consul had left Sicily with half of the Roman army, marched out from the major Carthaginian stronghold of Lilybaeum towards Panormus with 30,000 men and between 60 and 142 elephants.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=120\u2013121}} Halting some distance away, he devastated the harvest in the territories of Rome's newly allied cities, in an attempt to provoke the Roman commander, [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (died 221 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]], into battle.{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=159}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=559}} The Roman troops amounted to two legions,{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=559}} and they had been dispersed to gather the harvest. Metellus withdrew them in front of the advancing Carthaginians and they retreated into Panormus. Encouraged by this by now expected timidity, Hasdrubal advanced down the [[Oreto River|Oreto valley]], continuing to despoil the countryside. The Oreto reached the sea immediately south of Panormus, and once there Hasdubal ordered part of his army to cross the river and advance up to the city wall.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=120}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=83}}\n\nOnce the elephants had crossed, or were crossing, the river, Metellus sent his light infantry to skirmish with the Carthaginians and impede their passage. These light troops hurled javelins at the Carthaginians, and had been instructed to concentrate on their elephants. Panormus was a major supply depot, and townspeople were employed in carrying bundles of javelins from stocks within the city to the foot of the walls so that the Roman skirmishers were constantly resupplied.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=120}} The ground between the river and the city was covered with [[earthworks (military)|earthworks]], some constructed during the Roman siege and some part of the city's defensive works, which made it difficult for the elephants to advance, or even manoeuvre. The elephants' [[mahout]]s, eager to demonstrate their charges' prowess, nevertheless drove them forward. Some accounts also have missiles being hurled down from the city walls at them. Peppered with missiles and unable to retaliate, the elephants fled through the Carthaginian infantry behind them.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=83}}\n\n[[File:C._Caecilius_Metellus_Caprarius,_denarius,_125_BC,_RRC_269-1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Denarius]] of [[Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius|C.

From here Metellus fed fresh troops into the large-scale skirmish under the city walls. When the elephants broke, disorganising a large part of the Carthaginian army, and demoralising all of it, Metellus ordered an attack on its left flank. The Carthaginians fled; those who attempted to fight were cut down. Metellus did not permit a pursuit, but did capture ten elephants in the immediate aftermath and, according to some accounts, the rest of the surviving animals over the succeeding days.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=83}}\n\nContemporary accounts do not report the other losses of either side, although the Carthaginians' are thought to have been heavy. Modern historians consider later claims of 20,000\u201330,000 Carthaginian casualties improbable.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=93\u201394}} Similarly, later accounts that the large Celtic contingent in the Carthaginian army were drunk when the battle began are usually dismissed; as is the suggestion that Carthaginian fleet took part in the operation, causing heavy casualties when many fleeing soldiers ran into the sea hoping to be taken off by their ships.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=121}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=94}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe defeat, and especially the loss of the elephants, resulted in the Romans feeling freer to manoeuvre on the plains, and the Carthaginians no longer being willing to challenge them.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=190}} As was the Carthaginian custom after a defeat, Hasdrubal was recalled to Carthage to be executed.{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=160}} His successor, Adhubal, decided that the large fortified city of Selinus could no longer be garrisoned and had the town destroyed.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=83}} Encouraged by their victory at Panormus, the Romans moved against the main Carthaginian base on Sicily, Lilybaeum, in 249 BC. A large army commanded by the year's consuls [[Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC)|Publius Claudius Pulcher]] and [[Lucius Junius Pullus (consul 249 BC)|Lucius Junius Pullus]] besieged the city. They had rebuilt their fleet, and 200 ships blockaded the harbour.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=190}} The city was still held by the Carthaginians when the war ended nine years later in 241 BC with a Roman victory.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}}\n\nAfter his success at Panormus Metellus received a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in Rome on 7 September 250 BC, during which he paraded with the elephants he had captured at Panormus, who were then slaughtered in the [[Circus Maximus]]. The elephant was adopted as the emblem of the powerful Caecilii Metelli family, whose members featured an elephant on the coins they minted until the end of the Republic.{{sfn|Walbank|1979|pp=102\u2013103}}{{sfn|Crawford|1974|pp=287\u2013288, 292\u2013293, 387\u2013388, 390, 471}}\n\n==Notes, citations and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note|30em}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Nigel |date=1999 |title=The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage and the Struggle for the Mediterranean|location=London |publisher=Pimlico |page= |isbn=978-0-7126-6608-4 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Crawford\n|first=Michael\n|date=1974\n|title=Roman Republican Coinage\n|url=\n|location=Cambridge\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|oclc=859598398\n|isbn=\n|author-link=Michael Crawford (historian)\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =65\n| issue =1\n| pages =32\u201337\n| last =Curry\n| first =Andrew\n| title =The Weapon That Changed History\n| journal =Archaeology\n| date =2012\n| jstor =41780760\n\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|editor1-last=Hoyos\n|editor1-first=Dexter\n|first=Paul\n|last=Erdkamp\n|chapter=Manpower and Food Supply in the First and Second Punic Wars\n|date=2015\n|orig-year=2011\n|title=A Companion to the Punic Wars\n|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UzJ3BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+companion+to+the+Punic+Wars&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQkpLD5ernAhVlShUIHelGDecQ6wEILDAA#v=onepage&q=A%20companion%20to%20the%20Punic%20Wars&f=false\n|location=Chichester, West Sussex\n|publisher=John Wiley\n|pages= 58\u201376\n|isbn=978-1-1190-2550-4\n|author-link=\n\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Goldsworthy|title=The Fall of Carthage: The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-0-304-36642-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsnFSQAACAAJ|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Hau\n|first=Lisa\n|date=2016\n|title=Moral History from Herodotus to Diodorus Siculus\n|url=\n|location=Edinburgh\n|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|page=\n|isbn=978-1-4744-1107-3\n|author-link=\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|first=Dexter\n|last=Hoyos\n|date=2015\n|orig-year=2011\n|title=A Companion to the Punic Wars\n|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UzJ3BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+companion+to+the+Punic+Wars&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQkpLD5ernAhVlShUIHelGDecQ6wEILDAA#v=onepage&q=A%20companion%20to%20the%20Punic%20Wars&f=false\n|location=Chichester, West Sussex\n|publisher=John Wiley\n|isbn=978-1-1190-2550-4\n|author-link=\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|editor1-last=Hoyos|editor1-first=Dexter|last=Koon\n|first=Sam|chapter=Phalanx and Legion: the \"Face\" of Punic War Battle\n|date=2015\n|orig-year=2011|title=A Companion to the Punic Wars|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UzJ3BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+companion+to+the+Punic+Wars&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQkpLD5ernAhVlShUIHelGDecQ6wEILDAA#v=onepage&q=A%20companion%20to%20the%20Punic%20Wars&f=false\n|location=Chichester, West Sussex|publisher=John Wiley|pages=77\u201394  |isbn=978-1-1190-2550-4|author-link=|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Lazenby|first=John|title=The First Punic War: A Military History|location=Stanford, California|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-2673-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtnAOd-s1-YC|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{cite book|last=Miles|first=Richard|title=Carthage Must be Destroyed|location=London|publisher=Penguin |year=2011|isbn=978-0-14-101809-6|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|editor1-last=Hoyos\n|editor1-first=Dexter\n|first=Bernard\n|last=Mineo\n|chapter=Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\n|date=2015\n|orig-year=2011\n|title=A Companion to the Punic Wars\n|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UzJ3BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+companion+to+the+Punic+Wars&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQkpLD5ernAhVlShUIHelGDecQ6wEILDAA#v=onepage&q=A%20companion%20to%20the%20Punic%20Wars&f=false\n|location=Chichester, West Sussex\n|publisher=John Wiley\n|pages= 111\u2013128\n|isbn=978-1-1190-2550-4\n|author-link=\n\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =22\n| issue =1\n| pages =121\u2013129\n| last =Morgan\n| first =M.

Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132&nbsp;Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz, reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz, which is above the [[extremely high frequency|extremely high-frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400&nbsp;Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz. Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost. Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G. 5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G.\n\nThe industry project [[3GPP]] defines any system using \"[[5G NR]]\" (5G New Radio) software as, \"5G\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2017/08/02/understanding-3gpp-starting-basics|title=Understanding 3GPP \u2013 starting with the basics|date=2017-08-01|website=Qualcomm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> a definition that came into general use by late 2018.

[[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high-bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell. 5G can support up to a million devices per square kilometer, while 4G supports only up to 100,000 devices per square kilometer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://connect.altran.com/2018/03/eight-reasons-why-5g-is-better-than-4g/|title=Eight Reasons Why 5G Is Better Than 4G|date=March 16, 2018|publisher=[[Altran]]|author=Shatrughan Singh|accessdate=May 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525070540/https://connect.altran.com/2018/03/eight-reasons-why-5g-is-better-than-4g/|archive-date=May 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/clx-forum/1-million-iot-devices-per-square-km-are-we-ready-for-the-5g-transformation-5d2ba416a984|title=1 Million IoT Devices per Square Km \u2013 Are We Ready for the 5G Transformation?|first=C.

Radio Unit (RU) to the Distributor Unit (DU) being the NGFI-I (Next Generation Fronthaul Interface) and the DU to the Central Unit (CU) being the NGFI-II interface allowing a more diverse and cost-effective network. NGFI-I and NGFI-II have defined performance values which should be compiled to ensure different traffic types defined by the ITU are capable of being carried. 1914.3 standard is creating a new Ethernet frame format capable of carrying IQ data in a much more efficient way depending on the functional split utilized.

Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, and walls, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=2 | Cell types\n!

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

METIS achieved an early global consensus on these systems. In this sense, METIS played an important role of building consensus among other external major stakeholders prior to global standardization activities. This was done by initiating and addressing work in relevant global fora (e.g. ITU-R), as well as in national and regional regulatory bodies.<ref name=\"METIS presentation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|title=METIS projet presentation|date=November 2012|access-date=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211609/https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Also in November 2012, the iJOIN EU project was launched, focusing on \"[[small cell]]\" technology, which is of key importance for taking advantage of limited and strategic resources, such as the [[radio wave]] [[spectrum]].

Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132&nbsp;Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz, reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz, which is above the [[extremely high frequency|extremely high-frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400&nbsp;Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz. Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost. Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G. 5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G.\n\nThe industry project [[3GPP]] defines any system using \"[[5G NR]]\" (5G New Radio) software as, \"5G\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2017/08/02/understanding-3gpp-starting-basics|title=Understanding 3GPP \u2013 starting with the basics|date=2017-08-01|website=Qualcomm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> a definition that came into general use by late 2018.

[[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high-bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell. 5G can support up to a million devices per square kilometer, while 4G supports only up to 100,000 devices per square kilometer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://connect.altran.com/2018/03/eight-reasons-why-5g-is-better-than-4g/|title=Eight Reasons Why 5G Is Better Than 4G|date=March 16, 2018|publisher=[[Altran]]|author=Shatrughan Singh|accessdate=May 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525070540/https://connect.altran.com/2018/03/eight-reasons-why-5g-is-better-than-4g/|archive-date=May 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/clx-forum/1-million-iot-devices-per-square-km-are-we-ready-for-the-5g-transformation-5d2ba416a984|title=1 Million IoT Devices per Square Km \u2013 Are We Ready for the 5G Transformation?|first=C.

Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, and walls, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=2 | Cell types\n!

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

METIS achieved an early global consensus on these systems. In this sense, METIS played an important role of building consensus among other external major stakeholders prior to global standardization activities. This was done by initiating and addressing work in relevant global fora (e.g. ITU-R), as well as in national and regional regulatory bodies.<ref name=\"METIS presentation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|title=METIS projet presentation|date=November 2012|access-date=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211609/https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Also in November 2012, the iJOIN EU project was launched, focusing on \"[[small cell]]\" technology, which is of key importance for taking advantage of limited and strategic resources, such as the [[radio wave]] [[spectrum]].

The team was conceived by writer [[Gardner Fox]] during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] as a reimagining of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]]'s [[Justice Society of America]]. Originally consisting of [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Aquaman]] and the [[Martian Manhunter]], they first appeared together as the '''Justice League of America''' ('''JLA''') in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #28 (March 1960).<ref name=\"Fox 1960\">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Gardner Fox|Fox, Gardner]] |penciller=[[Mike Sekowsky|Sekowsky, Mike]]|inker=[[Bernard Sachs (comics)|Sachs, Bernard]], [[Joe Giella|Giella, Joe]], [[Murphy Anderson|Anderson, Murphy]]|story= Starro the Conqueror|title= [[The Brave and the Bold]] |issue=28 |date=March 1960}}</ref>\n\nThe Justice League's roster has rotated throughout the years, consisting of various superheroes from the [[DC Universe]], such as [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|The Atom]], [[Big Barda]], [[Black Canary]], [[Black Lightning]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel/Shazam]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Elongated Man]], [[Wally West|The Flash]], [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], [[Hawkgirl]], [[Hawkman]], [[Metamorpho]], [[Plastic Man]], [[Power Girl]], [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], [[Red Tornado]], [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]], and [[Zatanna]]. In ''[[The New 52]]'' reboot, Cyborg replaced the Martian Manhunter as one of the seven founding members.\n\nThe team received its own comic book title called ''Justice League of America'' in November 1960. With ''The New 52'' in 2011, DC Comics released a second volume of ''Justice League''. In July 2016, the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' initiative again relaunched the Justice League comic book titles with the third volume of ''Justice League''. Since its inception, the team has been featured in various films, television programs, and video games.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:JLA-AlexRoss.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The seven original members of the Justice League pictured from left to right: [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Aquaman]] and [[Martian Manhunter]]. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]\nVarious comic book series featuring the Justice League have remained generally popular with fans since inception and, in most incarnations, its roster includes DC's most popular characters. The Justice League concept has also been adapted into various other entertainment media, including various forms of television from the classic Saturday morning ''[[Super Friends]]'' [[animated series]] (1973\u20131986), a live-action series of specials ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' (1979), an unproduced ''[[Justice League of America (TV movie)|Justice League of America]]'' live-action series (for which the pilot film exists), the acclaimed ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' [[animated series]] (2001\u20132004), its sequel ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (2004\u20132006) and ''[[Justice League Action]]'' (2016\u2013present).\n\nA live-action film was also in the works around 2008 before being shelved. On June 6, 2012, Warner Bros. announced a new live action ''Justice League'' film was in development with [[Will Beall]] hired as screenwriter. However, the project was scrapped again. After the success of the [[Superman]] reboot ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', a film titled ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' was released in March 2016, directed by [[Zack Snyder]]. ''Batman v Superman'' script writer [[Chris Terrio]] also penned the script for ''Justice League''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/06/justice-league-movie_n_1573571.html |title=''Justice League'' Movie: Warner Bros.

When representatives of the planet Appellax sought to conquer Earth, they drew the individual attention of the Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Wonder Woman and the Martian Manhunter.\"</ref> Competing [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] warriors were sent to see who could conquer Earth first, to determine who will become the new ruler of their home planet. The aliens' attacks drew the attention of [[Aquaman]], [[Batman]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] (Barry Allen), [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] (Hal Jordan), [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. While the superheroes individually defeated most of the invaders, the heroes fell prey to a single competitor's attack; only by working together were they able to defeat the competitor. For many years, the heroes heralded this adventure as the event that prompted them to agree to pool resources when confronted with similar menaces.\n\nIn ''Justice League of America'' #144 (July 1977), [[Green Arrow]] uncovered inconsistencies in the team's records<ref>McAvennie \"1970s\" in Dolan, p. 174: \"Green Arrow thought he had learned the Justice League of America's origin back in issue #9...Now, he found inconsistencies in the story.  Writer Steve Englehart and artist Dick Dillin revealed the truth as told by former JLA member J'onn J'onzz.\"</ref> and extracted admissions from his colleagues that the seven founders had actually formed the League after Martian Manhunter was rescued from Martian forces by the other six founders, along with several other heroes including [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Robotman (Robert Crane)|Robotman]], [[Congorilla]], [[Rex the Wonder Dog]], and even [[Lois Lane]].\n\nGreen Lantern participated in this first adventure solely as Hal Jordan, as he had yet to become the costumed hero, the biggest inconsistency that Arrow found, as they celebrated the earlier incident's date, while recounting only the later one's events. When the group formalized their agreement, they suppressed news of it because of anti-Martian hysteria. Because the heroes had not revealed their identities to each other at the time, they did not realize that Jordan and Green Lantern were one and the same when he turned up in costume during the event described in #9. While most subsequent accounts of the League have made little mention of this first adventure, the animated ''Justice League'' series adapted this tale as the origin of the Justice League as well.\n\n''[[Secret Origins]]'' (vol. 2) #32 (Nov. 1988) updated ''Justice League of America'' #9's origin for Post-''Crisis'' continuity. Differences included the inclusion of the Silver Age [[Black Canary]] as a founding member and the absence of Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman. The ''JLA: Year One'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], by [[Mark Waid]], [[Brian Augustyn]] and [[Barry Kitson]], further expanded the ''Secret Origins'' depiction.<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 282: \"It was up to writers Mark Waid and Brian Augustyn and artist Barry Kitson to fill in the blanks.  With their twelve-issue maxiseries ''JLA: Year One'', the trio examined the early days of the team...''JLA: Year One'' proved a success and cleaned up decades of convoluted comic history.\"</ref>\n\nIn ''Justice League Task Force'' #16 (Sept. 1994), during [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], a then-unknown superhuman named [[Triumph (comics)|Triumph]] appeared. Triumph was revealed to have been a founding member of the Justice League and was their leader. On his first mission with the Justice League, Triumph seemingly \"saved the world\" but was teleported into a dimensional limbo that also affected the timestream, erasing all memory of him.\n\nIn ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7 (June 2006), the formation of \"New Earth\" (the new name for the Post-''Crisis'' Earth) restored Wonder Woman as a founding member of the Justice League. In Brad Meltzer's ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #0 (September 2006), it was revealed that Superman and Batman were again founding members as well. ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #51 (June 2007) confirmed that the 1989 ''Secret Origins'' and ''JLA: Year One'' origins were still in continuity at that time, with Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman joining the team with founding members' status shortly after the group's formation with Aquaman, Black Canary, Flash, Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/heroes_and_villains/?hv=origin_stories/justice_league_of_america&p=1 |last1=Waid |first1=Mark |last2=Reis |first2=Ivan |last3=Albert |first3=Oclair |publisher=DC Comics |title= American Made (2017) |archiveurl=https://moviesroot.com/download-american-made-2017-dual-audio-hindi-english-720p-999mb/ |archivedate=April 12, 2019 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |df= }}</ref> In ''Justice League of America'' #12 (October 2007), the founding members of the Justice League were shown to be Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Flash (Barry Allen), Aquaman, and the Martian Manhunter.\n\nWith DC's history rewritten due to the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' limited series, an entirely new origin for the Justice League appeared in the subsequent ''Justice League'' series which debuted with an October 2011 cover date as part of the company-wide event, ''[[The New 52]]''.

A follow-up limited series, entitled ''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League'', soon was prepared, although it was delayed due to the events shown in the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' limited series, but was eventually released as the second arc in ''JLA: Classified''. The Super Buddies consisted of Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Captain Atom, [[Fire (comics)|Fire]], [[Mary Marvel]], the Elongated Man with his wife, [[Sue Dibny]], [[Maxwell Lord]], and [[L-Ron]]. The second story arc of ''JLA: Classified'' focuses on the Super Buddies in a humorous story that features [[Power Girl]] and Guy Gardner, with and assisted by [[Doctor Fate]].\n\n====''JLA/Avengers''====\n{{Main|JLA/Avengers}}\nIn 2003\u20132004, [[George P\u00e9rez]] and [[Kurt Busiek]] produced a ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' crossover,<ref>Cowsill \"2000s\" in Dolan, p. 311 \"[''JLA/Avengers''] was an event that...proved to be one of the biggest and best of the DC and Marvel crossovers, incorporating many of the two companies' greatest heroes and villains.\"</ref> an idea that had been delayed for 20 years for various reasons.

Art by Ed McGuinness]]\nIn 2004, DC began an anthology series titled ''JLA: Classified'', which would feature rotating writers and artists producing self-contained story arcs and aborted miniseries projects that were reappropriated for publication within the pages of the series, starring the JLA. While the bulk of the stories took place within the continuity of the series (circa ''JLA'' #76\u2013113) some of the stories take place outside of regular DC Universe canon. The series was canceled as of issue #54 (May 2008).\n\n====''Justice''====\n{{Main|Justice (DC Comics)}}\nIn October 2005, DC began publishing the 12-issue miniseries ''Justice'' by writer [[Jim Krueger]], writer/illustrator [[Alex Ross]], and artist [[Doug Braithwaite]]. The story, which takes place outside regular DC continuity, has Lex Luthor assembling the [[Legion of Doom]] after he and several other villains begin to have nightmares about the end of the world and the failure of the Justice League to prevent the apocalypse. As the Legion begins engaging in unprecedented humanitarian deeds throughout the world, they also launch a series of attacks on the Justice League and their families. The threat that the Legion was warned about destroying the Earth turns out to be caused by Brainiac, who seeks to destroy Earth during the chaos.\n\n====''Justice League: Cry for Justice''====\n{{Main|Justice League: Cry for Justice}}\nOriginally planned as an ongoing title, ''Justice League: Cry For Justice'' is a miniseries created by writer [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] and artist Mauro Cascioli. The miniseries, set after the events of ''Final Crisis'', has Hal Jordan leaving the League following the deaths of Batman and Martian Manhunter, as their deaths have caused Hal to seek a more proactive manner of dealing with supervillains. Hal, along with Green Arrow, and later joined by Supergirl, Captain Marvel Jr., and [[Batwoman]] are then recruited by Ray Palmer to investigate a murder of a former colleague that had been carried out on orders from Prometheus. This ties into another string of murders, bringing Starman Mikaal Tomas and Congorilla together as their investigation of the murders of several European superheroes are also revealed to be the work of Prometheus.\n\nWith help from the Hawkman villain [[I.Q. (comics)|I.Q.]], Prometheus plans on creating the ultimate weapon in mass murder, a massive doomsday device which he plans on using to destroy entire cities, as part of his revenge scheme against the JLA for lobotomizing him. Disguised as Captain Marvel Jr., Prometheus maims Roy Harper and brutally injures JLA members Dr. Light II, Vixen, and Plastic Man while using the JLA Satellite to activate his doomsday device, which destroys Star City, killing 90,000 innocent civilians, including Roy Harper's young daughter Lian. Prometheus ultimately extorts his freedom from the League in exchange for the codes that will shut down his weapon, much to the horror of the JLA members. [[Green Arrow]] (with help from reformed supervillain the Shade), tracks Prometheus down and kills him by firing an arrow into his head.\n\nThe miniseries leads directly into the formation of a brand new JLA roster with Green Lantern Hal Jordan, Donna Troy, Dick Grayson as Batman, Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi), Mon-El, Cyborg, Starfire, Congorilla, Guardian, and Mikaal Tomas.\n\n====''JLA/The 99''====\n{{Main|JLA/The 99}}\nLaunching in October 2010, ''[[JLA/The 99]]'' was a crossover mini-series featuring the Justice League teaming up with the heroes of [[Teshkeel Comics]]' ''[[The 99]]'' series. The JLA consisted of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (John Stewart), The Flash (Barry Allen), The Atom (Ray Palmer), Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi), Hawkman, and Firestorm (Jason Rusch).\n{{clear}}\n\n==Publication history==\n===Golden Age===\n{{main|Golden Age of Comic Books}}\n\n{{Infobox comic book title <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| 2ndary_box=y\n| title = Justice League of America\n| image = Jla v1 001.jpg\n| caption = Cover for ''Justice League of America'' #1 (October 1960).<br> Art by [[Murphy Anderson]]\n| schedule = {{collapsible list| '''(vol. 1)'''<br> Bimonthly: #1\u20138; #105\u2013116<br>Eight times a year: #9\u201332; #96\u2013104<br>Nine times a year: #33\u201395<br>Monthly: #117\u2013261 <br> '''(vol. 2\u20135)'''<br> Monthly}}\n| format = Ongoing\n| publisher = [[DC Comics]]\n| genre= [[Superhero fiction|Superhero]]\n| date = {{collapsible list| '''(vol. 1)'''<br> November\u2013December 1960 \u2013 April 1987 <br> '''(vol. 2)'''<br> September 2006 \u2013 October 2011 <br> '''(vol. 3)'''<br> April 2013 \u2013 July 2014 <br> '''(vol. 4)'''<br> August 2015 \u2013 September 2016 <br> '''(vol. 5)''' April 2017 \u2013 present}}<!-- use cover date rather than on--sale date-->\n| issues = {{collapsible list| '''(vol. 1)'''<br> 261 and 3 ''Annual''s <br> '''(vol. 2)'''<br> 61 (#1\u201360 plus #0) <br>'''(vol. 3)'''<br> 14 <br>'''(vol. 4)'''<br>9 <br>'''(vol. 5)'''<br>17 (as of December 2017 cover date) 5 ''DC Rebirth'' one-shots and 1 ''Annual'' }} \n| main_char_team =\n| writers = {{collapsible list| '''(vol. 1)'''<br> [[Gardner Fox]], [[J.

The team was conceived by writer [[Gardner Fox]] during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] as a reimagining of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]]'s [[Justice Society of America]]. Originally consisting of [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Aquaman]] and the [[Martian Manhunter]], they first appeared together as the '''Justice League of America''' ('''JLA''') in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #28 (March 1960).<ref name=\"Fox 1960\">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Gardner Fox|Fox, Gardner]] |penciller=[[Mike Sekowsky|Sekowsky, Mike]]|inker=[[Bernard Sachs (comics)|Sachs, Bernard]], [[Joe Giella|Giella, Joe]], [[Murphy Anderson|Anderson, Murphy]]|story= Starro the Conqueror|title= [[The Brave and the Bold]] |issue=28 |date=March 1960}}</ref>\n\nThe Justice League's roster has rotated throughout the years, consisting of various superheroes from the [[DC Universe]], such as [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|The Atom]], [[Big Barda]], [[Black Canary]], [[Black Lightning]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel/Shazam]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Elongated Man]], [[Wally West|The Flash]], [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], [[Hawkgirl]], [[Hawkman]], [[Metamorpho]], [[Plastic Man]], [[Power Girl]], [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], [[Red Tornado]], [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]], and [[Zatanna]]. In ''[[The New 52]]'' reboot, Cyborg replaced the Martian Manhunter as one of the seven founding members.\n\nThe team received its own comic book title called ''Justice League of America'' in November 1960. With ''The New 52'' in 2011, DC Comics released a second volume of ''Justice League''. In July 2016, the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' initiative again relaunched the Justice League comic book titles with the third volume of ''Justice League''. Since its inception, the team has been featured in various films, television programs, and video games.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:JLA-AlexRoss.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The seven original members of the Justice League pictured from left to right: [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Aquaman]] and [[Martian Manhunter]]. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]\nVarious comic book series featuring the Justice League have remained generally popular with fans since inception and, in most incarnations, its roster includes DC's most popular characters. The Justice League concept has also been adapted into various other entertainment media, including various forms of television from the classic Saturday morning ''[[Super Friends]]'' [[animated series]] (1973\u20131986), a live-action series of specials ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' (1979), an unproduced ''[[Justice League of America (TV movie)|Justice League of America]]'' live-action series (for which the pilot film exists), the acclaimed ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' [[animated series]] (2001\u20132004), its sequel ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (2004\u20132006) and ''[[Justice League Action]]'' (2016\u2013present).\n\nA live-action film was also in the works around 2008 before being shelved. On June 6, 2012, Warner Bros. announced a new live action ''Justice League'' film was in development with [[Will Beall]] hired as screenwriter. However, the project was scrapped again. After the success of the [[Superman]] reboot ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', a film titled ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' was released in March 2016, directed by [[Zack Snyder]]. ''Batman v Superman'' script writer [[Chris Terrio]] also penned the script for ''Justice League''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/06/justice-league-movie_n_1573571.html |title=''Justice League'' Movie: Warner Bros.

When representatives of the planet Appellax sought to conquer Earth, they drew the individual attention of the Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Wonder Woman and the Martian Manhunter.\"</ref> Competing [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] warriors were sent to see who could conquer Earth first, to determine who will become the new ruler of their home planet. The aliens' attacks drew the attention of [[Aquaman]], [[Batman]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] (Barry Allen), [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] (Hal Jordan), [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. While the superheroes individually defeated most of the invaders, the heroes fell prey to a single competitor's attack; only by working together were they able to defeat the competitor. For many years, the heroes heralded this adventure as the event that prompted them to agree to pool resources when confronted with similar menaces.\n\nIn ''Justice League of America'' #144 (July 1977), [[Green Arrow]] uncovered inconsistencies in the team's records<ref>McAvennie \"1970s\" in Dolan, p. 174: \"Green Arrow thought he had learned the Justice League of America's origin back in issue #9...Now, he found inconsistencies in the story.  Writer Steve Englehart and artist Dick Dillin revealed the truth as told by former JLA member J'onn J'onzz.\"</ref> and extracted admissions from his colleagues that the seven founders had actually formed the League after Martian Manhunter was rescued from Martian forces by the other six founders, along with several other heroes including [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Robotman (Robert Crane)|Robotman]], [[Congorilla]], [[Rex the Wonder Dog]], and even [[Lois Lane]].\n\nGreen Lantern participated in this first adventure solely as Hal Jordan, as he had yet to become the costumed hero, the biggest inconsistency that Arrow found, as they celebrated the earlier incident's date, while recounting only the later one's events. When the group formalized their agreement, they suppressed news of it because of anti-Martian hysteria. Because the heroes had not revealed their identities to each other at the time, they did not realize that Jordan and Green Lantern were one and the same when he turned up in costume during the event described in #9. While most subsequent accounts of the League have made little mention of this first adventure, the animated ''Justice League'' series adapted this tale as the origin of the Justice League as well.\n\n''[[Secret Origins]]'' (vol. 2) #32 (Nov. 1988) updated ''Justice League of America'' #9's origin for Post-''Crisis'' continuity. Differences included the inclusion of the Silver Age [[Black Canary]] as a founding member and the absence of Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman. The ''JLA: Year One'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], by [[Mark Waid]], [[Brian Augustyn]] and [[Barry Kitson]], further expanded the ''Secret Origins'' depiction.<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 282: \"It was up to writers Mark Waid and Brian Augustyn and artist Barry Kitson to fill in the blanks.  With their twelve-issue maxiseries ''JLA: Year One'', the trio examined the early days of the team...''JLA: Year One'' proved a success and cleaned up decades of convoluted comic history.\"</ref>\n\nIn ''Justice League Task Force'' #16 (Sept. 1994), during [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], a then-unknown superhuman named [[Triumph (comics)|Triumph]] appeared. Triumph was revealed to have been a founding member of the Justice League and was their leader. On his first mission with the Justice League, Triumph seemingly \"saved the world\" but was teleported into a dimensional limbo that also affected the timestream, erasing all memory of him.\n\nIn ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7 (June 2006), the formation of \"New Earth\" (the new name for the Post-''Crisis'' Earth) restored Wonder Woman as a founding member of the Justice League. In Brad Meltzer's ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #0 (September 2006), it was revealed that Superman and Batman were again founding members as well. ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #51 (June 2007) confirmed that the 1989 ''Secret Origins'' and ''JLA: Year One'' origins were still in continuity at that time, with Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman joining the team with founding members' status shortly after the group's formation with Aquaman, Black Canary, Flash, Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/heroes_and_villains/?hv=origin_stories/justice_league_of_america&p=1 |last1=Waid |first1=Mark |last2=Reis |first2=Ivan |last3=Albert |first3=Oclair |publisher=DC Comics |title= American Made (2017) |archiveurl=https://moviesroot.com/download-american-made-2017-dual-audio-hindi-english-720p-999mb/ |archivedate=April 12, 2019 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |df= }}</ref> In ''Justice League of America'' #12 (October 2007), the founding members of the Justice League were shown to be Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Flash (Barry Allen), Aquaman, and the Martian Manhunter.\n\nWith DC's history rewritten due to the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' limited series, an entirely new origin for the Justice League appeared in the subsequent ''Justice League'' series which debuted with an October 2011 cover date as part of the company-wide event, ''[[The New 52]]''.

A follow-up limited series, entitled ''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League'', soon was prepared, although it was delayed due to the events shown in the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' limited series, but was eventually released as the second arc in ''JLA: Classified''. The Super Buddies consisted of Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Captain Atom, [[Fire (comics)|Fire]], [[Mary Marvel]], the Elongated Man with his wife, [[Sue Dibny]], [[Maxwell Lord]], and [[L-Ron]]. The second story arc of ''JLA: Classified'' focuses on the Super Buddies in a humorous story that features [[Power Girl]] and Guy Gardner, with and assisted by [[Doctor Fate]].\n\n====''JLA/Avengers''====\n{{Main|JLA/Avengers}}\nIn 2003\u20132004, [[George P\u00e9rez]] and [[Kurt Busiek]] produced a ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' crossover,<ref>Cowsill \"2000s\" in Dolan, p. 311 \"[''JLA/Avengers''] was an event that...proved to be one of the biggest and best of the DC and Marvel crossovers, incorporating many of the two companies' greatest heroes and villains.\"</ref> an idea that had been delayed for 20 years for various reasons.

Art by Ed McGuinness]]\nIn 2004, DC began an anthology series titled ''JLA: Classified'', which would feature rotating writers and artists producing self-contained story arcs and aborted miniseries projects that were reappropriated for publication within the pages of the series, starring the JLA. While the bulk of the stories took place within the continuity of the series (circa ''JLA'' #76\u2013113) some of the stories take place outside of regular DC Universe canon. The series was canceled as of issue #54 (May 2008).\n\n====''Justice''====\n{{Main|Justice (DC Comics)}}\nIn October 2005, DC began publishing the 12-issue miniseries ''Justice'' by writer [[Jim Krueger]], writer/illustrator [[Alex Ross]], and artist [[Doug Braithwaite]]. The story, which takes place outside regular DC continuity, has Lex Luthor assembling the [[Legion of Doom]] after he and several other villains begin to have nightmares about the end of the world and the failure of the Justice League to prevent the apocalypse. As the Legion begins engaging in unprecedented humanitarian deeds throughout the world, they also launch a series of attacks on the Justice League and their families. The threat that the Legion was warned about destroying the Earth turns out to be caused by Brainiac, who seeks to destroy Earth during the chaos.\n\n====''Justice League: Cry for Justice''====\n{{Main|Justice League: Cry for Justice}}\nOriginally planned as an ongoing title, ''Justice League: Cry For Justice'' is a miniseries created by writer [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] and artist Mauro Cascioli. The miniseries, set after the events of ''Final Crisis'', has Hal Jordan leaving the League following the deaths of Batman and Martian Manhunter, as their deaths have caused Hal to seek a more proactive manner of dealing with supervillains. Hal, along with Green Arrow, and later joined by Supergirl, Captain Marvel Jr., and [[Batwoman]] are then recruited by Ray Palmer to investigate a murder of a former colleague that had been carried out on orders from Prometheus. This ties into another string of murders, bringing Starman Mikaal Tomas and Congorilla together as their investigation of the murders of several European superheroes are also revealed to be the work of Prometheus.\n\nWith help from the Hawkman villain [[I.Q. (comics)|I.Q.]], Prometheus plans on creating the ultimate weapon in mass murder, a massive doomsday device which he plans on using to destroy entire cities, as part of his revenge scheme against the JLA for lobotomizing him. Disguised as Captain Marvel Jr., Prometheus maims Roy Harper and brutally injures JLA members Dr. Light II, Vixen, and Plastic Man while using the JLA Satellite to activate his doomsday device, which destroys Star City, killing 90,000 innocent civilians, including Roy Harper's young daughter Lian. Prometheus ultimately extorts his freedom from the League in exchange for the codes that will shut down his weapon, much to the horror of the JLA members. [[Green Arrow]] (with help from reformed supervillain the Shade), tracks Prometheus down and kills him by firing an arrow into his head.\n\nThe miniseries leads directly into the formation of a brand new JLA roster with Green Lantern Hal Jordan, Donna Troy, Dick Grayson as Batman, Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi), Mon-El, Cyborg, Starfire, Congorilla, Guardian, and Mikaal Tomas.\n\n====''JLA/The 99''====\n{{Main|JLA/The 99}}\nLaunching in October 2010, ''[[JLA/The 99]]'' was a crossover mini-series featuring the Justice League teaming up with the heroes of [[Teshkeel Comics]]' ''[[The 99]]'' series. The JLA consisted of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (John Stewart), The Flash (Barry Allen), The Atom (Ray Palmer), Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi), Hawkman, and Firestorm (Jason Rusch).\n{{clear}}\n\n==Publication history==\n===Golden Age===\n{{main|Golden Age of Comic Books}}\n\n{{Infobox comic book title <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| 2ndary_box=y\n| title = Justice League of America\n| image = Jla v1 001.jpg\n| caption = Cover for ''Justice League of America'' #1 (October 1960).<br> Art by [[Murphy Anderson]]\n| schedule = {{collapsible list| '''(vol. 1)'''<br> Bimonthly: #1\u20138; #105\u2013116<br>Eight times a year: #9\u201332; #96\u2013104<br>Nine times a year: #33\u201395<br>Monthly: #117\u2013261 <br> '''(vol. 2\u20135)'''<br> Monthly}}\n| format = Ongoing\n| publisher = [[DC Comics]]\n| genre= [[Superhero fiction|Superhero]]\n| date = {{collapsible list| '''(vol. 1)'''<br> November\u2013December 1960 \u2013 April 1987 <br> '''(vol. 2)'''<br> September 2006 \u2013 October 2011 <br> '''(vol. 3)'''<br> April 2013 \u2013 July 2014 <br> '''(vol. 4)'''<br> August 2015 \u2013 September 2016 <br> '''(vol. 5)''' April 2017 \u2013 present}}<!-- use cover date rather than on--sale date-->\n| issues = {{collapsible list| '''(vol. 1)'''<br> 261 and 3 ''Annual''s <br> '''(vol. 2)'''<br> 61 (#1\u201360 plus #0) <br>'''(vol. 3)'''<br> 14 <br>'''(vol. 4)'''<br>9 <br>'''(vol. 5)'''<br>17 (as of December 2017 cover date) 5 ''DC Rebirth'' one-shots and 1 ''Annual'' }} \n| main_char_team =\n| writers = {{collapsible list| '''(vol. 1)'''<br> [[Gardner Fox]], [[J.

With Ed Benes providing the pencils, Meltzer stripped the Justice League back to basics.\"</ref> The series featured a roster which included Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Black Canary, [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] ([[Green Arrow]]'s former sidekick), Red Tornado, [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], [[Black Lightning]], and [[Kendra Saunders|Hawkgirl]]. The first arc of the series focused upon Red Tornado and pitted the team against a new intelligent incarnation of [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] and the rebuilt [[Amazo]]. The new incarnation of the team has two main headquarters, linked by a [[Teleportation|transporter]]. At the first site is [[Hall of Justice (comics)|the Hall]], which in the mainstream DC Universe is a refurbished version of the Justice Society of America and the [[All-Star Squadron]]'s former headquarters located in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Black Canary is elected as the first official Chairperson after the fight against Amazo and Solomon Grundy, and led both the Justice League and Justice Society in a complex quest to reunite time-lost members of the pre-Crisis [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], who had been sent back in time to free both [[Bart Allen]] and [[Wally West|Flash]] from the other-dimensional realm of the [[Speed Force]]. Meltzer left the series at the end of issue #12, with one of his subplots ([[Per Degaton]], a pre-nuclear fire mutation version of [[Despero]], and a circa 1948 version of the [[Ultra-Humanite]] gathering for an unknown plot) resolved in the pages of ''Booster Gold''.{{issue|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[Dwayne McDuffie]] took over the writing job with the ''Justice League Anniversary Special'' and the main book with issue #13. Due to DC Comics seeking to launch a spin-off Justice League book led by Hal Jordan, the character was removed from the main League series and replaced by John Stewart. [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] also joined the roster, with the series entering into a series of tie-in storylines towards ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'', with the arrest of a large number of supervillains (gathered by Lex Luthor and [[Deathstroke]] to attack the League on the eve of the wedding of Black Canary and Green Arrow) setting up the ''[[Salvation Run]]'' tie-in miniseries. Also, roster members Red Tornado and [[Geo-Force]] were written out. Jordan was restored to the roster by issue #19 of the series, only to be removed once again by issue #31.\n\nIssue #21 saw the return of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] and the [[Human Flame]], setting up their appearances in ''[[Final Crisis]]''. Later issues would resolve issues involving Vixen's power level increase and see the integration of the [[Milestone Comics]] characters the [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)|Shadow Cabinet]] and [[Icon (comics)|Icon]], who fought the Justice League over the remains of the villainous [[Doctor Light (comics)|Doctor Light]]. The group suffered greater losses during ''Final Crisis'' with the deaths of Martian Manhunter and Batman, as well as the resignations of Superman and Wonder Woman, who could no longer devote themselves full-time to the League due to the events of the ''[[New Krypton]]'' and ''Rise of the Olympian'' storylines in their respective titles. Hal Jordan would resign as well, clearing the way for John Stewart's return to the team. Black Canary found herself declaring the League no more, though the group would continue with Canary taking a secondary role. Her last act as leader was to assign John Stewart and Firestorm the task of hunting down the Human Flame,{{issue|date=November 2012}} for his part in the murder of Martian Manhunter, as seen in the ''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'' miniseries.\n\nVixen would take over the team, with Plastic Man rejoining the group.

During the confrontation over Jordan's group using torture to extract information from the villains being blackmailed into carrying out Prometheus' plan, both Roy Harper and [[Supergirl]] would discover that one of Jordan's heroes, [[Captain Marvel Jr.]], was really Prometheus in disguise. In the ensuing battle, the League would suffer horrible losses: Roy Harper was maimed and his daughter Lian and hundreds of thousands of people in Star City would be killed by a doomsday device that Prometheus had activated. Vixen would have her leg broken and Plastic Man would have his powers permanently scrambled, making him a slowly disintegrating puddle creature. To save other cities from being destroyed like Star City, the League reluctantly allowed Prometheus to go free.
