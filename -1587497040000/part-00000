They are found in many parts of the world, such as [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], northern [[Russia]], the [[Alps]], the [[Pyrenees]]. [[Scotland]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]]. Huts are basic and unmanned, without running water. \n\n==Bothy==\nA [[bothy]] is a basic shelter, usually left unlocked and available for anyone to use free of charge. They are found in remote mountainous areas of [[Scotland]], [[Northern England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. Most are ruined buildings which have been restored to a basic standard, providing a windproof and watertight shelter. They vary in size from little more than a large box up to two-storey cottages. They usually have designated sleeping areas, which commonly are either an upstairs room or a raised platform, thus allowing one to keep clear of cold air and draughts at floor height. No bedding, [[mattress]]es or [[blanket]]s are provided. Public access to bothies is either on foot, by [[bicycle]] or boat. Most bothies have a [[fireplace]] and are near a natural source of [[water]]. A [[spade]] may be provided to bury [[excrement]].<ref>[https://www.mountainbothies.org.uk/bothies/what-is-a-bothy/ \"What is a bothy\", Mountain Bothies Association.]</ref>\n\n== ''Biwakschachteln'' ==\nShelters, known in [[German language|German]] as ''Biwakschachtel'', or [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac box]], can also be found in remote areas of the [[Alps]]. Even though ''Biwakschachteln'' are also tended to by [[Alpine Club]]s, they differ markedly from other [[mountain hut]]s, because they do not have a permanent resident who tends to the building and provides food and refreshments.<ref>[https://www.bergzeit.de/magazin/biwakschachtel-alpen-notunterkunft/ Arnold Zimprich, \"Biwakschachteln in den Alpen: Infos & Tipps zur Notunterkunft\".

At 4,003 metres (13,133 ft) it is the highest mountain hut owned by the [[Swiss Alpine Club]], but can be used only in case of emergency.<ref>[http://www.vs-wallis.ch/wallis/huetten/solvay.html Solvayh\u00fctte]</ref>\n\n== ''Boofen'' ==\nAn even simpler shelter is found in the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]] of German-speaking [[Saxon Switzerland]] where climbers refer to overnighting in the open air as ''Boofen'' (pronounced \"bo-fen\"). The spot selected for overnight stays usually comprises an overhang in the sandstone rock or a cave, the so-called ''Boofe'' (\"bo-fe\"). This has often been adapted with a sleeping area and fireplace. In the [[Saxon Switzerland National Park|national park]] itself, ''Boofen'' is only permitted at designated sites and only in connection with climbing, although in this case lighting fires is absolutely forbidden. The colloquial [[Thuringian dialect|Saxon]] word ''boofen'' was derived from ''pofen'' (= sleep soundly and for a long time). \n\n==Huts by country==\n\n===Finland===\n[[File:Oahujoki wilderness hut in Lemmenjoki National Park, Inari (August 2019, 1).jpg|thumb|The Oahujoki wilderness hut in [[Lemmenjoki National Park]], Finland, can accommodate seven people overnight.]]\n\nOfficial wilderness huts are mostly maintained by [[Mets\u00e4hallitus]] ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] for ''Administration of Forests''), the Finnish state-owned forest management company. Most of the wilderness huts in Finland are situated in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Their size can vary greatly: the Lahtinen cottage in the [[Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area]] can barely hold two people, whereas the Luiroj\u00e4rvi cottage in the [[Urho Kekkonen National Park]] can hold as many as 16.\n\nA wilderness hut need not be reserved beforehand, and they are open for everyone tracking by foot, ski or similar means. Commercial stays overnight are prohibited in the wilderness huts owned by Mets\u00e4hallitus.  Unofficial and unmaintained huts also exist.\n\nFor centuries the vast wildernesses of Finland and its resources were divided amongst the Finnish agricultural societies (such as families, villages, parishes, and provinces) for the purpose of collecting resources. Areas divided in this way were called ''er\u00e4maa'', literally \"portion-land,\" (now literally the word for \"wilderness\" in modern Finnish). People from agricultural societies made trips to their ''er\u00e4maas'' in the summer, mainly to trap animals for [[fur]] but also to hunt game, fish, and collect taxes from the local hunter-fisher population.\n\nHuts were built in the wilderness for use as base camps for hunters and fishermen. Also non-agricultural [[Sami people]] built huts to help them manage reindeer. The earliest huts were only allowed to be used by people from the communities that owned them. Outsiders were not allowed to use the resources of other communities' ''er\u00e4maas''.\n\nHuts that were free for everyone were first seen in late 18th century Finland, when dwelling places were built along walking routes for passers-by. In the 19th century the authorities started building these huts. Later in the 20th century they started to be built for travellers.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{See also|Tramping in New Zealand}}\n\n[[New Zealand]] has a network of approximately 950 backcountry huts.<ref name=\"NZ-Huts\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-stay/backcountry-hut-information/ |title=Backcountry hut information: Places to stay |publisher=Department of Conservation |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>  The huts are officially maintained by the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] (DOC), although some of the huts have been adopted and maintained by local [[hiking]] and hunting clubs by arrangement.  There are also unofficial and privately owned huts in some places. They vary from small [[bivouac shelter]]s made of wood to large modern huts that can sleep up to 40 people, with separate cooking areas, utilities and gas.\n\nSome huts were initially commissioned or built by clubs along commonly walked routes, both for safety reasons as appropriate, and sometimes for convenience.  The network of back-country huts in New Zealand was largely extended in the mid-20th-century, when many more were built to serve the deer cullers of the [[New Zealand Forest Service]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/historic/by-region/east-coast/te-urewera/te-totara-hut/ |title=Historic Te Totara Hut: Te Urewera |publisher=Department of Conservation |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>  Most larger and more modern huts, like some found on the [[New Zealand Great Walks|Great Walks]], have been purpose designed and built to serve [[Tramping|trampers]]. Many of New Zealand's back-country huts are remote and rarely visited, and it is common for recreational trampers to design trips with the idea of reaching and visiting specific huts. Some people actively keep count of which huts they have visited, a practice which is informally referred to as hut bagging.\n\n[[File:Waiopehu Hut Pass.jpg|thumb|right|New Zealand backcountry hut pass]]\n\nBack-country huts in New Zealand were free to use until the early 1990s, when the New Zealand Department of Conservation began charging for their use. For most back-country huts, nightly hut tickets are purchased via an honesty system by people who use the huts, with an additional option of purchasing an annual pass for people who use huts frequently.

Many users belong to clubs which helped to build and maintain the huts before the government department was created, and consequently inherited them. It is common to find people who refuse to pay for the use of huts in protest, arguing that the government is trying to charge them to use facilities that they themselves are entirely responsible for providing. DOC argues that all hut fees are used for the continued maintenance of huts, and for building new huts as appropriate. It has at times made efforts to demonstrate this by specifically allocating money from hut fees towards budgets for these purposes.\n\nThe majority of the huts were built in an era of lower levels of government regulation and the long term use of the huts was not considered.  As a result of the [[Cave Creek disaster]] in 1995, DOC tightened up on the standards for structures on public land.  Some of the huts were upgraded to meet build regulations whilst others were removed or had certain facilities (such as beds) removed to cause them to fall into less strict building categories. In 2008, because of the recognition of the unique situation and the remote locations, the government relaxed the building standards for the huts.

They are found in many parts of the world, such as [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], northern [[Russia]], the [[Alps]], the [[Pyrenees]]. [[Scotland]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]]. Huts are basic and unmanned, without running water. \n\n==Bothy==\nA [[bothy]] is a basic shelter, usually left unlocked and available for anyone to use free of charge. They are found in remote mountainous areas of [[Scotland]], [[Northern England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. Most are ruined buildings which have been restored to a basic standard, providing a windproof and watertight shelter. They vary in size from little more than a large box up to two-storey cottages. They usually have designated sleeping areas, which commonly are either an upstairs room or a raised platform, thus allowing one to keep clear of cold air and draughts at floor height. No bedding, [[mattress]]es or [[blanket]]s are provided. Public access to bothies is either on foot, by [[bicycle]] or boat. Most bothies have a [[fireplace]] and are near a natural source of [[water]]. A [[spade]] may be provided to bury [[excrement]].<ref>[https://www.mountainbothies.org.uk/bothies/what-is-a-bothy/ \"What is a bothy\", Mountain Bothies Association.]</ref>\n\n== ''Biwakschachteln'' ==\nShelters, known in [[German language|German]] as ''Biwakschachtel'', or [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac box]], can also be found in remote areas of the [[Alps]]. Even though ''Biwakschachteln'' are also tended to by [[Alpine Club]]s, they differ markedly from other [[mountain hut]]s, because they do not have a permanent resident who tends to the building and provides food and refreshments.<ref>[https://www.bergzeit.de/magazin/biwakschachtel-alpen-notunterkunft/ Arnold Zimprich, \"Biwakschachteln in den Alpen: Infos & Tipps zur Notunterkunft\".

The spot selected for overnight stays usually comprises an overhang in the sandstone rock or a cave, the so-called ''Boofe'' (\"bo-fe\"). This has often been adapted with a sleeping area and fireplace. In the [[Saxon Switzerland National Park|national park]] itself, ''Boofen'' is only permitted at designated sites and only in connection with climbing, although in this case lighting fires is absolutely forbidden. The colloquial [[Thuringian dialect|Saxon]] word ''boofen'' was derived from ''pofen'' (= sleep soundly and for a long time). \n\n==Huts by country==\n\n===Finland===\n[[File:Oahujoki wilderness hut in Lemmenjoki National Park, Inari (August 2019, 1).jpg|thumb|The Oahujoki wilderness hut in [[Lemmenjoki National Park]], Finland, can accommodate seven people overnight.]]\n\nOfficial wilderness huts are mostly maintained by [[Mets\u00e4hallitus]] ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] for ''Administration of Forests''), the Finnish state-owned forest management company. Most of the wilderness huts in Finland are situated in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Their size can vary greatly: the Lahtinen cottage in the [[Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area]] can barely hold two people, whereas the Luiroj\u00e4rvi cottage in the [[Urho Kekkonen National Park]] can hold as many as 16.\n\nA wilderness hut need not be reserved beforehand, and they are open for everyone tracking by foot, ski or similar means. Commercial stays overnight are prohibited in the wilderness huts owned by Mets\u00e4hallitus.  Unofficial and unmaintained huts also exist.\n\nFor centuries the vast wildernesses of Finland and its resources were divided amongst the Finnish agricultural societies (such as families, villages, parishes, and provinces) for the purpose of collecting resources. Areas divided in this way were called ''er\u00e4maa'', literally \"portion-land,\" (now literally the word for \"wilderness\" in modern Finnish). People from agricultural societies made trips to their ''er\u00e4maas'' in the summer, mainly to trap animals for [[fur]] but also to hunt game, fish, and collect taxes from the local hunter-fisher population.\n\nHuts were built in the wilderness for use as base camps for hunters and fishermen. Also non-agricultural [[Sami people]] built huts to help them manage reindeer. The earliest huts were only allowed to be used by people from the communities that owned them. Outsiders were not allowed to use the resources of other communities' ''er\u00e4maas''.\n\nHuts that were free for everyone were first seen in late 18th century Finland, when dwelling places were built along walking routes for passers-by. In the 19th century the authorities started building these huts. Later in the 20th century they started to be built for travellers.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{See also|Tramping in New Zealand}}\n\n[[New Zealand]] has a network of approximately 950 backcountry huts.<ref name=\"NZ-Huts\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-stay/backcountry-hut-information/ |title=Backcountry hut information: Places to stay |publisher=Department of Conservation |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>  The huts are officially maintained by the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] (DOC), although some of the huts have been adopted and maintained by local [[hiking]] and hunting clubs by arrangement.  There are also unofficial and privately owned huts in some places. They vary from small [[bivouac shelter]]s made of wood to large modern huts that can sleep up to 40 people, with separate cooking areas, utilities and gas.\n\nSome huts were initially commissioned or built by clubs along commonly walked routes, both for safety reasons as appropriate, and sometimes for convenience.  The network of back-country huts in New Zealand was largely extended in the mid-20th-century, when many more were built to serve the deer cullers of the [[New Zealand Forest Service]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/historic/by-region/east-coast/te-urewera/te-totara-hut/ |title=Historic Te Totara Hut: Te Urewera |publisher=Department of Conservation |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>  Most larger and more modern huts, like some found on the [[New Zealand Great Walks|Great Walks]], have been purpose designed and built to serve [[Tramping|trampers]]. Many of New Zealand's back-country huts are remote and rarely visited, and it is common for recreational trampers to design trips with the idea of reaching and visiting specific huts. Some people actively keep count of which huts they have visited, a practice which is informally referred to as hut bagging.\n\n[[File:Waiopehu Hut Pass.jpg|thumb|right|New Zealand backcountry hut pass]]\n\nBack-country huts in New Zealand were free to use until the early 1990s, when the New Zealand Department of Conservation began charging for their use. For most back-country huts, nightly hut tickets are purchased via an honesty system by people who use the huts, with an additional option of purchasing an annual pass for people who use huts frequently. Huts on frequently used and heavily marketed tracks, such as the [[New Zealand Great Walks]], usually operate on a booking system, and often have resident wardens checking the bookings of users who arrive to stay the night.<ref name=NZ-Huts/>\n\nSince the inception of hut fees in New Zealand, there has been controversy amongst some hut users.
