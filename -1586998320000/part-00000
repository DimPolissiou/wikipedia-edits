'''S''' means \"Stereo\", '''L''' means \"Player\". Originally released as a [[high fidelity]] consumer [[Phonograph|record player]], it quickly became adopted among radio and [[disco]] club [[disc jockey]]s, thanks to the direct drive, high torque motor design, making it initially suitable for pushbutton cueing and starting of tracks on radio and in dance clubs. It is still extremely popular with audiophiles{{Citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=advertising with no proof}}.\n\nWhen the use of slip-mats for cueing and beat-mixing (and scratching) became popular in [[hip hop music]], the quartz-controlled high torque motor system enabled records to be mixed with consistency and accuracy. A primary design goal was for hi-fidelity, but having good build quality, control over wow and flutter, and minimized resonance made the equipment particularly suitable for use in nightclubs and other public-address applications. Since its release in 1978, SL-1200MK2 and its successors were the most common turntable for [[DJ]]ing and [[scratching]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=advertising with no proof}}. Producers, [[Disc jockey|DJ]]<nowiki/>s and [[Master of ceremonies|MC]]<nowiki/>s refer to the Technics turntable as the \"Tech 12's\", \"the 1's and 2's\" and the \"Wheels of Steel\".\n\n1200s are commonly used in recording studios and for non-electronic live music performance. More than 3 million units were sold. It is widely regarded as one of the most durable and reliable turntables ever produced. Many 1970s units are still in heavy use{{Citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=advertising}}. In the autumn of 2010, Panasonic announced that the series was to be discontinued.<ref>[http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2010/10/28/dead-spin-panasonic-discontinues-technics-analog-turntables/ Dead spin: Panasonic discontinues Technics analog turntables] - Oct 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://studio-lights.com/blog/technics-discontinued-1200-turntable.htm|title=Technics Analogue Turntables Discontinued|publisher=}}</ref> However, at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show, Panasonic announced that they would return in two models named \"Grand Class\": one a limited run of 1200 globally (1200GAE), and the other a consumer product (1200G). A lighter and less expensive 1200GR model was announced.\n\nAt the [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]], a Technics SL-1210<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rise And Fall Of The Technics 1210|url=http://www.thehiphoprecords.com/posts/rise-fall-technics-1210/|publisher=TheHipHopRecords.com}}</ref> is on display<ref>[http://blog.discostudio.co.uk/2010/05/technics-sl-1200-technics-sl-1210-shaped-our-world/ Technics SL-1200 / Technics SL-1210 Shaped Our World] - May 2010</ref> as one of the pieces of technology that have \"shaped the world we live in\".<ref>[http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/everyday_life/leisure/1968-2000/TL.0245/ Pair of quartz synthesiser direct-drive turntables, 1999] - 1999</ref>\n\n==Features==\nSL-1200 features include:\n* Magnetic (no wear), direct drive (low slip) mechanism.\n* High [[torque]] (1.5 [[kilogram-force|kgf]]\u00b7cm or 0.15 [[newton metre|N\u00b7m]]), which means the platter spins at the desired speed almost immediately (0.7 seconds to reach 33 \u00b9\u2044\u2083 RPM from standstill), and rapidly reacquires the desired speed, without \"overshooting\", if the platter is dragged or nudged.

Option to select -16% to +16% added (M5G/MK5G/GLD, GAE/G/GR & MK7).\n* High reliability: many examples of SL-1200s lasting well over 15 years of heavy use and withstanding physical shock without functional impairment.\n* S-shaped tone arm: No longer popular on high end hi-fi turntables.\n\n* Dimensions MK1:  45.3&nbsp;cm (w) x 36.6&nbsp;cm (d) x 18&nbsp;cm (h)\n* Dimensions MK2:  45.3&nbsp;cm (w) x 36&nbsp;cm (d) x 16.2&nbsp;cm (h)\n* Weight MK2: 11&nbsp;kg (net, unboxed without lid)\n* Weight G/GAE: 18&nbsp;kg\n* Weight GR: 11.5&nbsp;kg\n* Weight MK7: 9.6&nbsp;kg<ref>{{cite web |title=Technics MK7 |url=https://www.technics.com/us/news/20190107-sl-1200mk7/ |ref=26}}</ref>\n* Voltage: 220 V / 110 V (selectable)\n* Pitch Control: +/- 8% or +/- 16%\n* Starting Time (MK2): 0.7s\n* Rotation Speeds: 33-1/3 & 45 rpm \n* Rotation Speeds: 33-1/3, 45 rpm & 78rpm (MK4 MK7, G & GR)\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Turntablism}}\n\nThe SL-1200 was the most influential turntable.<ref name=\"wired\">[https://www.wired.com/2002/05/blackbox/ Six Machines That Changed The Music World], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', May 2002</ref> It was developed in 1971 by a team led by Shuichi Obata at Matsushita, which then released it onto the market in 1972.<ref name=\"medium\">Brian Coleman, [https://medium.com/@briancoleman/the-technics-1200-hammer-of-the-gods-xxl-fall-1998-5b93180a67da The Technics 1200\u200a\u2014\u200aHammer Of The Gods], [[Medium (website)|Medium]]</ref> It was adopted by [[New York City]] [[hip hop]] DJs such as [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Grandmaster Flash]]<ref>[http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1301251 The National Museum of American History: Turntable, used by Grandmaster Flash]</ref> in the 1970s. As they experimented with the SL-1200 decks, they developed [[scratching]] techniques when they found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.<ref name=\"wired\"/>\n\n==Legacy models==\n\n===Original model===\n[[File:Technics SL-1200 Original 1972.jpg|thumb|The original SL-1200 from 1972]]\n[[File:Technics EPA-120 Tonearm.jpg|thumb|The Technics EPA-120 tonearm was standard equipment on the original SL-1200 and was significantly different than the tonearm introduced with the MK2 and subsequent models]]\n====SL-1200====\nThe SL-1200 was introduced in 1972 as an evolution to the popular SL-1100. It was dubbed \"The Middle Class Player System\". It was delivered in two different versions: The SL-1200 came with a tonearm section. The SL-120 came without a tonearm section. An [[SME Limited|SME]] tonearm was the usual choice for the audiophile.\n\n===MK2 models===\nThe SL-1200 Mark 2 was introduced in 1979 as an update to the SL-1200. It represented a culmination of Technics Turntable Innovations. It was dubbed as \"The Middle Class Quartz Direct Drive\". It soon found its way into discos as well as [[Radio broadcasting|radio stations]] for airplay because of its vibration damping ability and resistance to feedback, and eventually it became popular with pioneering [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] DJs. Model numbers indicated colour: the 1200 (silver) and 1210 (matte black). This was the same in the US and Japan initially, however later the 1200 was available in both silver and matte black finishes.<!-- I wasn't 100% sure on these, but know the EU doesn't have the choice of colour for 1200 model ...edit *ONLY IF YOU KNOW BETTER* !!) --><!-- Yes, 1200 is silver 1210 black --> Since 1997, The Mk2 had the pitch slide potentiometer improved in order to remove the quartz lock conflict when beatmatching near the 0% mark. in order to do this, the SFDZ122N11-1 part number was replaced with an improved SFDZ122N11-2 part which had a +/- 0.5mm quartz travel lock, much shorter than previous versions. This meant that the null point on the centre voltage tap was slightly bigger thus removing the quartz lock conflict. The difference can be seen in the following video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_rr01ssq8o\n====SL-1200MK2====\nReleased in summer of 1978. this model came in both silver and matte black. Technics improved the motor and shock resistance and changed the rotary pitch control to a slider style. This became the base model and is the oldest whose production continued until 2010. The older version of this model that was sold in the 1970s and 1980s has a large {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} plate where the RCA and ground wires enter the unit, while the newer version has a smaller {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} hole in the rubber where the RCA and ground enter.  International versions of the SL-1200MK2 included switches for line voltage and frequency beneath the platter.\n\n====SL-1210MK2====\nThis model came in satin black metallic finish and is nearly the same in function as the SL-1200MK2, although some of the circuitry inside is updated to use fewer types of pots and resistors.<ref>SL-1200mk2 and SL-1210mk2 service manuals</ref> The Technics 1210 series also had a switch to change between voltages on the underside of the platter. It was unavailable from official Panasonic dealers in the United States.\n====SL-1200MK2PK====\nThis model has a matte black finish, and was only available in the United States.\n\n===MK3 models===\n====SL-1200MK3====\nReleased in 1989, has a matte black finish like the MK2, gold RCA plugs, and a small gold-foil Technics label on the back. It was destined only for the Japanese market.\n====SL-1200MK3D====\nJapan only, factory gold RCA cables, black or silver finish. Pitch reset button.\n\n====SL-1200M3D====\nReleased in 1997, has a silver finish like the MK2 (beside silver finish, there are copies with \"champagneish\" color), a detached dust cover (no hinges), a recessed power switch to avoid DJ's from accidentally turning the deck off during use, and no self-locking [[detent]] (\"click\") at the zero point of the pitch adjustment slider, allowing more precise control of pitch near that point. It has a reset button that sets the pitch adjustment to 0, regardless of the actual position of the pitch adjustment slider. In addition the M3D series has unique details: the brand and model label is printed in a single line instead of two; and the stroboscopic light is red with a slightly orange tone. This model also introduced a slot near the counterweight allowing for storage of a second headshell.\n\n====SL-1210M3D====\nThis model is the same as the SL-1200M3D except with a matte black finish like the MK2 and a voltage switch.\n\n===MK4 models===\n====SL-1200MK4====\nThe SL-1200 Mark 4 was introduced in 1996. It was an update to the SL-1200MK2. Only available in Japan / Southeast Asia Markets Price for around [[United States dollar|$]]650.00. It has a matte black finish. This model is aimed at the hi-end audiophile market rather than DJs. It is the last model made with the detent (\"click\") in the neutral position (+/- 0%) of the pitch adjustment slider. In addition to the existing 33 RPM and 45 RPM buttons, the MK4 adds a 78 RPM button. It is designed to be used with regular removable RCA cables (along with a removable ground/earth cable) rather than having hard wired RCA cables like all other 1200/1210 models. The tonearm was different to the previous models as it was made from titanium.\n\n[[File:Technics sl-1200 mk5.jpg|thumb|Technics SL-1200 MK5 playing a record.]]\n===MK5 models===\n====SL-1200MK5====\nReleased on 1 November 2000, has a silver finish like the MK2, increases the range of anti-skate settings from 0\u20133 [[gram-force|grams-force]] (0\u201330 [[newton (unit)|mN]]) to 0\u20136&nbsp;grams-force (0\u201360&nbsp;mN). It has a white [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] target light (previous versions only had an [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent bulb]]). Current MK5 models have a removable lid with magnets as opposed to the MK2 and MK3 removable hinged lid. Available as 120 volt model for the North American market. The MK5 is the last 1200 model to retain an analog pitch control.\n\n====SL-1210MK5====\nHas a matte black finish like the MK2, and is exactly the same as the SL-1200MK5, aside from the voltage switch, like the other decks in the 1210 series. Available as 120 volt model for the North American market.\n====SL-1200MK5G====\nSimilar to the SL-1210M5G.\n====SL-1210M5G====\nReleased on 1 November 2002, has a glossy black finish with silver speckles. It was a special 30th-anniversary edition. It was initially launched in Japan only (together with the MK5) but then became internationally available. It switches between \u00b18% and \u00b116% ranges for pitch adjustment, and the pitch control is digital which will be the standard for all 1200 models from this point on. It also features blue target lights and blue pitch-number illumination. The brake strength  potentiometer, although still located beneath platter, can now be adjusted, unlike previous models, using a small plastic knob. Minor improvements over Mk2, Mk3, Mk4, & 1200LTD include improved tonearm mounting and oxygen-free copper wire, improved vibration damping in the body, improvements to pitch control accuracy and better LEDs. Available as 120 volt model for the North American market.\n\n===MK6 models===\n* '''SL-1200MK6-K''' & '''SL-1200MK6-S''' (released in February 2008 in Japan) with minor improvements including improved tonearm mounting and oxygen-free copper wire, improved vibration damping in the body, improvements to the pitch control accuracy and better [[LED]]s. '''-S''' model has a silver finish like the MK2.\n* '''SL-1200MK6K1''' Released on 12 December 2007 (in Japan) as a special 35th-anniversary Limited edition of 1000 units. It consisted of a standard black MK6 packaged up with a booklet and gold record.\n\n===Special models===\nThese were limited edition versions, with [[24 karat]] gold plated metal parts including tonearm and buttons. Many \"non-official\" special models of the SL-1200 and SL-1210 appeared over the years, mainly given away as prizes for turntablism, most notably the DMC World Championship, who awarded the winner a pair of 24K gold plated Technics turntables. Due to the customisation trend that has grown in the DJ community, many local events or competitions gave away custom coloured or finished units.\n====SL-1200LTD====\nThe SL-1200 Limited Edition was introduced in 1995 commemorating two million units in sales. Only 5,000 units were made.<ref>https://www.technics.com/global/sl1200/heritage/#product5</ref> Like the MK3D, it has a pitch reset button, but differs in that it also has a self-locking [[detent]] at the zero position of pitch adjustment. This model has a piano black gloss finish and gold-plated hardware. It was priced at about US$1200.00.\n====SL-1200GLD====\nReleased in 2004, another limited edition model, with only 3,000 units manufactured. 1,500 of them were sold in the U.S. and the other 1,500 internationally. It is based on the MK5G model, with blue (instead of the regular white) target lights, a piano black gloss finish, and gold-plated hardware.

An Allen & Heath\u2122 4-Channel with Effects Mixer sits between the two turntables, allowing shorter travel during Battles, or competitions.]]\nThe SL-1200 series was developed as a special project by Technics parent company [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] in an attempt to solve problems related to turntable design. The task included minimizing acoustic feedback, unwanted resonances, wow and flutter and speed errors. This was achieved by designing a heavy plinth (base) made of a non-resonant composite sandwiched between a cast alloy top plate and a solid rubber base.  In addition, the adjustable rubber-damped feet insulated against acoustic feedback, which can be a serious problem when operating a turntable in close proximity to loudspeakers (a common situation for DJs).\n\nThe drive system designed by Matsushita is [[direct-drive turntable|direct-drive]] rather than the more commonly found [[belt-drive turntable|belt-drive]] type, a less expensive design. The direct-drive design, which was developed to reduce wow and flutter, produces a very quiet turntable that, for a direct-drive turntable, has minimal motor and bearing noise, (although the bearing rumble does tend to become characteristic in well-used turntables). This was partially achieved through the fact that the SL1210/1200 made the platter a part of the motor mechanism.\n\nOn the underside of the platter a large magnet is placed over the spindle, surrounding the coils and forming the motor drive, thus eliminating loss through power transfer. The SL-1200 utilizes a Frequency Generator Servo Control Quartz Lock system that is claimed to produce the most accurate and consistent speed possible. The system is immune to static and dynamic stylus drag which otherwise cause unwanted speed variances that change the pitch and tempo of the music.<ref>SL1200MK2 Service Manual. Specifications.

'''S''' means \"Stereo\", '''L''' means \"Player\". Originally released as a [[high fidelity]] consumer [[Phonograph|record player]], it quickly became adopted among radio and [[disco]] club [[disc jockey]]s, thanks to the direct drive, high torque motor design, making it initially suitable for pushbutton cueing and starting of tracks on radio and in dance clubs. It is still extremely popular with audiophiles{{Citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=advertising with no proof}}.\n\nWhen the use of slip-mats for cueing and beat-mixing (and scratching) became popular in [[hip hop music]], the quartz-controlled high torque motor system enabled records to be mixed with consistency and accuracy. A primary design goal was for hi-fidelity, but having good build quality, control over wow and flutter, and minimized resonance made the equipment particularly suitable for use in nightclubs and other public-address applications. Since its release in 1978, SL-1200MK2 and its successors were the most common turntable for [[DJ]]ing and [[scratching]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=advertising with no proof}}. Producers, [[Disc jockey|DJ]]<nowiki/>s and [[Master of ceremonies|MC]]<nowiki/>s refer to the Technics turntable as the \"Tech 12's\", \"the 1's and 2's\" and the \"Wheels of Steel\".\n\n1200s are commonly used in recording studios and for non-electronic live music performance. More than 3 million units were sold. It is widely regarded as one of the most durable and reliable turntables ever produced. Many 1970s units are still in heavy use{{Citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=advertising}}. In the autumn of 2010, Panasonic announced that the series was to be discontinued.<ref>[http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2010/10/28/dead-spin-panasonic-discontinues-technics-analog-turntables/ Dead spin: Panasonic discontinues Technics analog turntables] - Oct 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://studio-lights.com/blog/technics-discontinued-1200-turntable.htm|title=Technics Analogue Turntables Discontinued|publisher=}}</ref> However, at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show, Panasonic announced that they would return in two models named \"Grand Class\": one a limited run of 1200 globally (1200GAE), and the other a consumer product (1200G).

It was dubbed \"The Middle Class Player System\". It was delivered in two different versions: The SL-1200 came with a tonearm section. The SL-120 came without a tonearm section. An [[SME Limited|SME]] tonearm was the usual choice for the audiophile.\n\n===MK2 models===\nThe SL-1200 Mark 2 was introduced in 1979 as an update to the SL-1200. It represented a culmination of Technics Turntable Innovations. It was dubbed as \"The Middle Class Quartz Direct Drive\". It soon found its way into discos as well as [[Radio broadcasting|radio stations]] for airplay because of its vibration damping ability and resistance to feedback, and eventually it became popular with pioneering [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] DJs. Model numbers indicated colour: the 1200 (silver) and 1210 (matte black). This was the same in the US and Japan initially, however later the 1200 was available in both silver and matte black finishes.<!-- I wasn't 100% sure on these, but know the EU doesn't have the choice of colour for 1200 model ...edit *ONLY IF YOU KNOW BETTER* !!) --><!-- Yes, 1200 is silver 1210 black --> Since 1997, The Mk2 had the pitch slide potentiometer improved in order to remove the quartz lock conflict when beatmatching near the 0% mark. in order to do this, the SFDZ122N11-1 part number was replaced with an improved SFDZ122N11-2 part which had a +/- 0.5mm quartz travel lock, much shorter than previous versions. This meant that the null point on the centre voltage tap was slightly bigger thus removing the quartz lock conflict. The difference can be seen in the following video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_rr01ssq8o\n====SL-1200MK2====\nReleased in summer of 1978. this model came in both silver and matte black. Technics improved the motor and shock resistance and changed the rotary pitch control to a slider style. This became the base model and is the oldest whose production continued until 2010. The older version of this model that was sold in the 1970s and 1980s has a large {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} plate where the RCA and ground wires enter the unit, while the newer version has a smaller {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} hole in the rubber where the RCA and ground enter.  International versions of the SL-1200MK2 included switches for line voltage and frequency beneath the platter.\n\n====SL-1210MK2====\nThis model came in satin black metallic finish and is nearly the same in function as the SL-1200MK2, although some of the circuitry inside is updated to use fewer types of pots and resistors.<ref>SL-1200mk2 and SL-1210mk2 service manuals</ref> The Technics 1210 series also had a switch to change between voltages on the underside of the platter. It was unavailable from official Panasonic dealers in the United States.\n====SL-1200MK2PK====\nThis model has a matte black finish, and was only available in the United States.\n\n===MK3 models===\n====SL-1200MK3====\nReleased in 1989, has a matte black finish like the MK2, gold RCA plugs, and a small gold-foil Technics label on the back. It was destined only for the Japanese market.\n====SL-1200MK3D====\nJapan only, factory gold RCA cables, black or silver finish. Pitch reset button.\n\n====SL-1200M3D====\nReleased in 1997, has a silver finish like the MK2 (beside silver finish, there are copies with \"champagneish\" color), a detached dust cover (no hinges), a recessed power switch to avoid DJ's from accidentally turning the deck off during use, and no self-locking [[detent]] (\"click\") at the zero point of the pitch adjustment slider, allowing more precise control of pitch near that point. It has a reset button that sets the pitch adjustment to 0, regardless of the actual position of the pitch adjustment slider. In addition the M3D series has unique details: the brand and model label is printed in a single line instead of two; and the stroboscopic light is red with a slightly orange tone. This model also introduced a slot near the counterweight allowing for storage of a second headshell.\n\n====SL-1210M3D====\nThis model is the same as the SL-1200M3D except with a matte black finish like the MK2 and a voltage switch.\n\n===MK4 models===\n====SL-1200MK4====\nThe SL-1200 Mark 4 was introduced in 1996. It was an update to the SL-1200MK2. Only available in Japan / Southeast Asia Markets Price for around [[United States dollar|$]]650.00. It has a matte black finish. This model is aimed at the hi-end audiophile market rather than DJs. It is the last model made with the detent (\"click\") in the neutral position (+/- 0%) of the pitch adjustment slider. In addition to the existing 33 RPM and 45 RPM buttons, the MK4 adds a 78 RPM button. It is designed to be used with regular removable RCA cables (along with a removable ground/earth cable) rather than having hard wired RCA cables like all other 1200/1210 models. The tonearm was different to the previous models as it was made from titanium.\n\n[[File:Technics sl-1200 mk5.jpg|thumb|Technics SL-1200 MK5 playing a record.]]\n===MK5 models===\n====SL-1200MK5====\nReleased on 1 November 2000, has a silver finish like the MK2, increases the range of anti-skate settings from 0\u20133 [[gram-force|grams-force]] (0\u201330 [[newton (unit)|mN]]) to 0\u20136&nbsp;grams-force (0\u201360&nbsp;mN). It has a white [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] target light (previous versions only had an [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent bulb]]). Current MK5 models have a removable lid with magnets as opposed to the MK2 and MK3 removable hinged lid. Available as 120 volt model for the North American market. The MK5 is the last 1200 model to retain an analog pitch control.\n\n====SL-1210MK5====\nHas a matte black finish like the MK2, and is exactly the same as the SL-1200MK5, aside from the voltage switch, like the other decks in the 1210 series. Available as 120 volt model for the North American market.\n====SL-1200MK5G====\nSimilar to the SL-1210M5G.\n====SL-1210M5G====\nReleased on 1 November 2002, has a glossy black finish with silver speckles. It was a special 30th-anniversary edition. It was initially launched in Japan only (together with the MK5) but then became internationally available. It switches between \u00b18% and \u00b116% ranges for pitch adjustment, and the pitch control is digital which will be the standard for all 1200 models from this point on. It also features blue target lights and blue pitch-number illumination. The brake strength  potentiometer, although still located beneath platter, can now be adjusted, unlike previous models, using a small plastic knob. Minor improvements over Mk2, Mk3, Mk4, & 1200LTD include improved tonearm mounting and oxygen-free copper wire, improved vibration damping in the body, improvements to pitch control accuracy and better LEDs. Available as 120 volt model for the North American market.\n\n===MK6 models===\n* '''SL-1200MK6-K''' & '''SL-1200MK6-S''' (released in February 2008 in Japan) with minor improvements including improved tonearm mounting and oxygen-free copper wire, improved vibration damping in the body, improvements to the pitch control accuracy and better [[LED]]s. '''-S''' model has a silver finish like the MK2.\n* '''SL-1200MK6K1''' Released on 12 December 2007 (in Japan) as a special 35th-anniversary Limited edition of 1000 units. It consisted of a standard black MK6 packaged up with a booklet and gold record.\n\n===Special models===\nThese were limited edition versions, with [[24 karat]] gold plated metal parts including tonearm and buttons. Many \"non-official\" special models of the SL-1200 and SL-1210 appeared over the years, mainly given away as prizes for turntablism, most notably the DMC World Championship, who awarded the winner a pair of 24K gold plated Technics turntables. Due to the customisation trend that has grown in the DJ community, many local events or competitions gave away custom coloured or finished units.\n====SL-1200LTD====\nThe SL-1200 Limited Edition was introduced in 1995 commemorating two million units in sales. Only 5,000 units were made<ref>https://www.technics.com/global/sl1200/heritage/#product5</ref>. Like the MK3D, it has a pitch reset button, but differs in that it also has a self-locking [[detent]] at the zero position of pitch adjustment. This model has a piano black gloss finish and gold-plated hardware. It was priced at about US$1200.00.\n====SL-1200GLD====\nReleased in 2004, another limited edition model, with only 3,000 units manufactured. 1,500 of them were sold in the U.S. and the other 1,500 internationally. It is based on the MK5G model, with blue (instead of the regular white) target lights, a piano black gloss finish, and gold-plated hardware. It was \"created to commemorate the 3 Million turntables sold by technics in the last 30 years\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.panasonic.com/consumer_electronics/technics_dj/sweepstakes.asp |title=Technics* SL-1200GLD Sweepstakes |last=Panasonic Corporation of North America |authorlink=Panasonic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040810015440/http://www.panasonic.com:80/consumer_electronics/technics_dj/sweepstakes.asp |archive-date=2004-08-10 |url-status=dead |access-date=2018-11-25}}</ref>\n\n==Current models==\n===Grand Class SL-1200 Series===\nDevelopment of a completely rebuilt SL-1200 from the ground up with the intent to create a new system for Hi-Fi use and to redefine the direct-drive turntable reference.\n====SL-1200G====\n[[File:Technics SL-1200G under the platter.jpg|alt=A Technics SL-1200G with the platter removed reveals the top of the newly designed coreless direct drive motor assembly.

The G/GAE and GR both use what are essentially the same 9-pole motor. Whereas the G has twin rotors, the GR has a single rotor, giving it less torque.

It also features new DJ play functions and features, such as reverse playback, adjustable starting torque and brake speed, detachable terminals for power cable and phono cables (which was previously only available on the MK4 model), an option to select the strobe light indicator from red to blue (the 33/45 lights, 0-pitch reset light and the X2 pitch range light also change to match the color selected), and a new push-type structure for the white LED stylus illuminator.\n====SL-1210MK7====\nIs the same as the SL-1200MK7, but intended for the European market.\n\n==Design strengths==\n[[File:Technics 1200 and Xone 42 1 2016-06-17.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two SL-1200M3Ds set up for [[DJ]] Battle, or [[Scratching]], Mixing. An Allen & Heath\u2122 4-Channel with Effects Mixer sits between the two turntables, allowing shorter travel during Battles, or competitions.]]\nThe SL-1200 series was developed as a special project by Technics parent company [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] in an attempt to solve problems related to turntable design. The task included minimizing acoustic feedback, unwanted resonances, wow and flutter and speed errors. This was achieved by designing a heavy plinth (base) made of a non-resonant composite sandwiched between a cast alloy top plate and a solid rubber base.  In addition, the adjustable rubber-damped feet insulated against acoustic feedback, which can be a serious problem when operating a turntable in close proximity to loudspeakers (a common situation for DJs).\n\nThe drive system designed by Matsushita is [[direct-drive turntable|direct-drive]] rather than the more commonly found [[belt-drive turntable|belt-drive]] type, a less expensive design. The direct-drive design, which was developed to reduce wow and flutter, produces a very quiet turntable that, for a direct-drive turntable, has minimal motor and bearing noise, (although the bearing rumble does tend to become characteristic in well-used turntables). This was partially achieved through the fact that the SL1210/1200 made the platter a part of the motor mechanism.\n\nOn the underside of the platter a large magnet is placed over the spindle, surrounding the coils and forming the motor drive, thus eliminating loss through power transfer. The SL-1200 utilizes a Frequency Generator Servo Control Quartz Lock system that is claimed to produce the most accurate and consistent speed possible. The system is immune to static and dynamic stylus drag which otherwise cause unwanted speed variances that change the pitch and tempo of the music.<ref>SL1200MK2 Service Manual. Specifications.

It is not capable of supporting the older [[Polytonic orthography|polytonic Greek]].\n\nIt is not fully compatible with [[ISO 8859-7]] because a few characters, including the letter [[\u0386]], are located at different byte values:\n\n* <code>&#xB5;</code>{{efn|This is in addition to the existing <code>&#x03BC;</code> at 0xEC, which remains in place. Unicode calls the one at 0xB5 \"[[Micro-#Symbol encoding in character sets|micro sign]]\" (U+00B5) and the one at 0xEC \"Greek small letter Mu\" (U+03BC), although the former is mapped to the latter by NFKC (although not NFC) [[Unicode normalization]]. See also [[Duplicate characters in Unicode#Duplicate vs. derived character|Duplicate characters in Unicode \u00a7 Duplicate vs. derived character]].}} and <code>\u00b6</code> are added at their locations from [[Windows-1252]] and [[ISO 8859-1]] ([[hexadecimal|0x]]B5 and 0xB6). This collides with the locations of <code>\u0385</code> and <code>\u0386</code>, respectively, in ISO 8859-7.\n* <code>\u2018</code> and <code>\u2019</code> are moved from their ISO 8859-7 locations (0xA1 and 0xA2) to their Windows-1252 locations (0x91 and 0x92). The displaced <code>\u0385</code> and <code>\u0386</code> are moved to the vacated space at 0xA1 and 0xA2 respectively.\n* <code>\u00a4</code> and <code>\u00a5</code> are added at their locations from Windows-1252 and ISO 8859-1 (0xA4 and 0xA5). This collides with additions made to ISO 8859-7 in 2003, when <code>[[Euro|\u20ac]]</code> and <code>[[Drachma|\u20af]]</code> respectively were added to the same locations. The <code>\u20ac</code> was added to Windows-1253 at 0x80, the same location which it was added to in Windows-1252. An [[iota subscript]] (\u037a) was also added to ISO 8859-7 at 0xAA; this remains unallocated in Windows-1253.\n* Several further characters are added at their Windows-1252 locations, although the rest do not collide with ISO 8859-7.\n\n[[Unicode]] is preferred for Greek in modern applications, especially as [[UTF-8]] encoding on the Internet. Unicode provides many more glyphs for complete coverage, see [[Greek alphabet#Greek in Unicode|Greek alphabet in Unicode]] and [[Ancient Greek Musical Notation]] for tables.\n\n==Character set==\nThe following table shows Windows-1253.

Returning to its original name (the \"WWE Draft\") and a traditional draft format, it was the second draft of 2019, following April's [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]]. The draft began on the October 11 episode of ''[[Friday Night SmackDown]]'' (in [[Paradise, Nevada]]) and concluded on the October 14 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' (in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]), with ''SmackDown'' airing on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] and ''Raw'' on the [[USA Network]]. It was the first draft in which the brand's television networks were presented as having an influence over WWE's drafting decisions. \n\n2019 was the first year in which the WWE held two drafts during the same calendar year. This was because of the issues of the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]] introduced with April's Superstar Shake-up and even more so because of ''SmackDown''{{'}}s move to FOX\u2014''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' were both previously on the USA Network. Over 70 wrestlers (both singles competitors and tag teams) from the Raw, SmackDown, [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]] rosters were eligible to be drafted to either Raw or SmackDown, including all Raw and SmackDown champions. Most draft picks were announced on the live broadcasts of ''SmackDown'' and ''Raw'', while supplemental picks were announced afterwards via WWE's website. In storyline, wrestlers who were not drafted to either brand became free agents and could sign with the brand of their choosing. The Wild Card Rule also ended with this draft.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nIn April 2019, [[WWE]] held the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]], a [[WWE draft|draft]] between WWE's [[WWE brand extension|brands]] with a nontraditional format in which drafting decisions were made behind the scenes rather than on-screen.<ref name=\"Raw04152019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/15/4-15-powells-wwe-raw-tv-review-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-one/|title=4/15 Powell's WWE Raw TV Review: The 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night One|date=April 15, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 15, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown04162019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/16/4-16-wwe-smackdown-live-results-barnetts-review-of-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-two-with-vince-mcmahon-introducing-the-brands-biggest-acquisition-paige-introduces-her-new-tag-team/|title=4/16 WWE Smackdown Live Results: Barnett's review of the 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night Two with Vince McMahon introducing the brand's biggest acquisition, Paige introduces her new tag team|date=April 16, 2019|last=Barnett|first=Jake |work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref> Shortly after the Shake-up, WWE Chairman and CEO [[Vince McMahon]] introduced the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]], in which up to four wrestlers would be allowed to appear on the opposing brand's show by invitation for one night only with unsanctioned appearances penalized.<ref name=\"Raw05062019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/05/06/5-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-review-of-roman-reigns-returning-to-raw-the-build-to-money-in-the-bank-continues/|title=5/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell's review of Roman Reigns returning to Raw, the build to Money in the Bank continues|date=May 6, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/raw-smackdown-live-wild-card-rule-explained|title=Mr. McMahon's new \"Wild Card Rule\" explained|date=May 6, 2019|last=Benigno|first=Anthony|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref> Following this, however, the Wild Card Rule's stipulations were not enforced, with numerous wrestlers freely appearing on both shows weekly without any penalties, blurring the lines between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands.

Returning to its original name (the \"WWE Draft\") and a traditional draft format, it was the second draft of 2019, following April's [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]]. The draft began on the October 11 episode of ''[[Friday Night SmackDown]]'' (in [[Paradise, Nevada]]) and concluded on the October 14 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' (in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]), with ''SmackDown'' airing on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] and ''Raw'' on the [[USA Network]]. It was the first draft in which the brand's television networks were presented as having an influence over WWE's drafting decisions. \n\n2019 was the first year in which the WWE held two drafts during the same calendar year. This was because of the issues of the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]] introduced with April's Superstar Shake-up and even more so because of ''SmackDown''{{'}}s move to FOX\u2014''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' were both previously on the USA Network. Over 70 wrestlers (both singles competitors and tag teams) from the Raw, SmackDown, [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]] rosters were eligible to be drafted to either Raw or SmackDown, including all Raw and SmackDown champions. Most draft picks were announced on the live broadcasts of ''SmackDown'' and ''Raw'', while supplemental picks were announced afterwards via WWE's website. In storyline, wrestlers who were not drafted to either brand became free agents and could sign with the brand of their choosing. The Wild Card Rule also ended with this draft.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nIn April 2019, [[WWE]] held the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]], a [[WWE draft|draft]] between WWE's [[WWE brand extension|brands]] with a nontraditional format in which drafting decisions were made behind the scenes rather than on-screen.<ref name=\"Raw04152019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/15/4-15-powells-wwe-raw-tv-review-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-one/|title=4/15 Powell's WWE Raw TV Review: The 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night One|date=April 15, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 15, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown04162019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/16/4-16-wwe-smackdown-live-results-barnetts-review-of-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-two-with-vince-mcmahon-introducing-the-brands-biggest-acquisition-paige-introduces-her-new-tag-team/|title=4/16 WWE Smackdown Live Results: Barnett's review of the 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night Two with Vince McMahon introducing the brand's biggest acquisition, Paige introduces her new tag team|date=April 16, 2019|last=Barnett|first=Jake |work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref> Shortly after the Shake-up, WWE Chairman and CEO [[Vince McMahon]] introduced the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]], in which up to four wrestlers would be allowed to appear on the opposing brand's show by invitation for one night only with unsanctioned appearances penalized.<ref name=\"Raw05062019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/05/06/5-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-review-of-roman-reigns-returning-to-raw-the-build-to-money-in-the-bank-continues/|title=5/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell's review of Roman Reigns returning to Raw, the build to Money in the Bank continues|date=May 6, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/raw-smackdown-live-wild-card-rule-explained|title=Mr. McMahon's new \"Wild Card Rule\" explained|date=May 6, 2019|last=Benigno|first=Anthony|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref> Following this, however, the Wild Card Rule's stipulations were not enforced, with numerous wrestlers freely appearing on both shows weekly without any penalties, blurring the lines between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands.

The draft was announced to occur on the October 11 and 14 episodes of ''SmackDown'' and ''Raw'', respectively. Returning to its original name (the \"WWE Draft\") and a traditional draft format, personalities from FOX and NBCUniversal were scheduled to appear; the first time that television networks were presented as having an influence over WWE's drafting decisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-draft-coming-this-october|title=WWE Draft set for SmackDown on Oct. 11 and Raw on Oct. 14|date=September 15, 2019|author=WWE.com Staff|work=[[WWE]]|accessdate=September 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/new-wwe-draft-set-for-two-nights-in-october-2019-over-smackdown-raw-shows/|title=New WWE Draft set for two nights in October 2019 over SmackDown, Raw shows|date=September 15, 2019|last=Crosby|first=Jack|work=[[CBS Sports]]|accessdate=September 15, 2019}}</ref> The Wild Card Rule also ended with this draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/wwe/2019/09/17/wwe-confirms-wild-card-rule-dead-wwe-draft-raw-smackdown-live/|title=WWE Confirms the Wild Card Rule Will Be Gone After the WWE Draft|date=September 17, 2019|last=Casey|first=Connor|work=ComicBook.com|accessdate=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe picks were presented by personalities associated with [[Fox Sports]] and NBCUniversal properties, including Fox [[Fox MLB|MLB]] analyst [[Alex Rodriguez]], ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''{{'}}s [[Michael Che]] and [[Colin Jost]] (who performed in the [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant Memorial Battle Royal]] at [[WrestleMania 35]] earlier in 2019), ''[[Mr. Robot]]''{{'}}s [[Christian Slater]], ''[[Fox NFL]]'' lead commentators [[Joe Buck]] and [[Troy Aikman]], ''[[Mad Money]]'' host [[Jim Cramer]], Fox MLB analysts [[Kevin Burkhardt]] and [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]], ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]''{{'}}s [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Howie Long]], [[Michael Strahan]], [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], and [[Tony Gonzalez]], NFL analysts [[Ronde Barber]], [[Charles Davis (defensive back)|Charles Davis]], [[Chris Spielman]], and [[Daryl Johnston]], ''[[Fox NFL Kickoff]]''{{'}}s [[Charissa Thompson]], [[Michael Vick]], and [[Peter Schrager]], ''[[Big Noon Kickoff]]''{{'}}s [[Rob Stone (sportscaster)|Rob Stone]] (former [[WWE 24/7 Champion]]), [[Brady Quinn]], [[Reggie Bush]], [[Matt Leinart]], and [[Urban Meyer]], ''[[Fox College Football]]'' analyst [[Joel Klatt]], [[Dul\u00e9 Hill]] from USA's ''[[Psych]]'' and ''[[Suits (American TV series)|Suits]]'', [[James Roday]] from ''Psych'', [[Marcus Lemonis]] from [[CNBC]]'s ''[[The Profit (TV series)|The Profit]]'', [[Margaret Josephs]] and [[Melissa Gorga]] from [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[The Real Housewives of New Jersey]]'', [[Rodney Harrison]] and [[Chris Simms]] from NBC's ''[[Football Night in America]]'', and [[Rebecca Lowe]], [[Robbie Mustoe]], and [[Kyle Martino]] from ''Premier League Live''.<ref name=\"2019draftrules\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/article/star-studded-celebrity-lineup-including-alex-rodriguez-michael-che-and-colin-jost|title=Star-studded celebrity lineup, including Alex Rodriguez, Michael Che and Colin Jost, to take part in WWE Draft|date=October 10, 2019|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2019 draft rules===\nThe rules of the draft were posted on WWE's website on October 10.<ref name=\"2019draftrules\"/> The list of eligible wrestlers was posted the same day.
