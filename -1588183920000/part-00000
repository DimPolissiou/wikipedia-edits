The cooperation agreement involved Wee 2050 having up to 8 places on the ADR's electoral lists for the legislative election of October 2018, and ensured that the movement could remain relatively independent by not requiring the Wee 2050 candidates to be members of the ADR per se.\n\n==Ideology==\nThe party was founded as a single-issue party, to introduce equality between private and public sector pensions.

The cooperation agreement involved Wee 2050 having up to 8 places on the ADR's electoral lists for the legislative election of October 2018, and ensured that the movement could remain relatively independent by not requiring the Wee 2050 candidates to be members of the ADR per se.\n\n==Ideology==\nThe party was founded as a single-issue party, to introduce equality between private and public sector pensions.
