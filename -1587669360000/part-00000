Set in [[Chicago]] in the [[Jazz Age|jazz age]], the musical is based on a [[Chicago (play)|1926 play of the same name]] by reporter [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], about actual criminals and the crimes on which she reported. The story is a [[satire]] on [[Political corruption|corruption]] in the administration of [[criminal justice]] and the concept of the \"celebrity criminal\".\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened in 1975 at the [[46th Street Theatre]]<ref name=\"ChitaRivera.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chitarivera.com/productions/chicago.htm|title=Chicago|accessdate=January 6, 2009}}</ref> and ran for 936 performances, until 1977. Bob Fosse choreographed the original production, and his style is strongly identified with the show. It debuted in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1979, where it ran for 600 performances. ''Chicago'' was revived on Broadway in 1996, and a year later in the West End.\n\nThe 1996 Broadway production holds the record as the longest-running musical revival and the longest-running American musical in Broadway history. It is the second [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|longest-running show to ever run on Broadway]], behind only ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. ''Chicago'' surpassed ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' on November 23, 2014, when it played its 7,486th performance.<ref>Gans, Andrew. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/all-that-jazz-chicago-becomes-second-longest-running-broadway-show-tonight-335960 \"\"All That Jazz\": ''Chicago'' Becomes Second Longest-Running Broadway Show Tonight\"] Playbill.com, November 23, 2014</ref> The West End revival became the longest-running American musical in West End history. ''Chicago'' has been staged in numerous productions around the world, and has toured extensively in the United States and United Kingdom. The [[Chicago (2002 film)|2002 film version]] of the musical won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==History==\nThe musical ''Chicago'' is based on [[Chicago (play)|a play]] of the same name by reporter and playwright [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of accused murderers [[Beulah Annan]] and [[Belva Gaertner]] for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.  In the early 1920s, Chicago's press and public became riveted by the subject of homicides committed by women. Several high-profile cases arose, which generally involved women killing their lovers or husbands. These cases were tried against a backdrop of changing views of women in the [[jazz age]], and a long string of acquittals by [[Cook County]] juries of female murderers (juries at the time were all male, and convicted murderers generally faced death by hanging). A lore arose that, in Chicago, feminine or attractive women could not be convicted. The ''Chicago Tribune'' generally favored the prosecution's case, while still presenting the details of these women's lives. Its rivals at the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst papers]] were more pro-defendant, and employed what were derisively called \"sob-sisters\" \u2013 women reporters who focused on the plight, attractiveness, redemption, or grace of the female defendants. Regardless of stance, the press covered several of these women as celebrities.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Girls of Murder City: fame, lust, and the beautiful killers that inspired ''Chicago'' | publisher=Penguin Group /Viking Press |author=Perry, Douglas | year=2010 | location=New York | pages=1\u20137, 16\u201318, 57\u201358 | isbn=978-0-670-02197-0}}</ref>\n\nAnnan, the model for the character of [[Roxie Hart]], was 23 when she was accused of the April 3, 1924,<ref name=Grubb>{{cite book |title=Razzle Dazzle: The Life and Work of Bob Fosse |last=Grubb |first=Kevin Boyd |year=1989 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-03414-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/razzledazzlelife0000grub/page/193 193\u2013203] |url=https://archive.org/details/razzledazzlelife0000grub/page/193 }}</ref> murder of Harry Kalstedt, who served as the basis for the Fred Casely character.  The ''Tribune'' reported that Annan played the [[foxtrot]] record ''Hula Lou'' over and over for two hours before calling her husband to say she killed a man who \"tried to make love to her\".   Her husband Albert Annan inspired the character, Amos Hart. Albert was an auto mechanic who bankrupted himself to defend his wife, only for her to publicly dump him the day after she was acquitted. [[Velma Kelly]] is based on Gaertner, who was a cabaret singer, and society divorc\u00e9e. The body of Walter Law was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of Gaertner's abandoned car on March 12, 1924. Two police officers testified that they had seen a woman getting into the car and shortly thereafter heard gunshots. A bottle of gin and an automatic pistol were found on the floor of the car. Lawyers William Scott Stewart and W. W. O'Brien were models for a composite character in ''Chicago'', [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Just days apart, separate juries acquitted both women.<ref>McConnell, Virginia A.

The show received both good box-office sales and newspaper notices and was mounted on Broadway in 1926, running 172 performances. [[Cecil B. DeMille]] produced a [[silent film]] version, ''[[Chicago (1927 film)|Chicago]]'' (1927), starring former [[Mack Sennett]] bathing beauty [[Phyllis Haver]] as Roxie Hart. It was later remade as ''[[Roxie Hart (film)|Roxie Hart]]'' (1942) starring [[Ginger Rogers]], but in this version, Roxie was accused of murder without having really committed it.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Gwen Verdon]] read the play and asked her husband, Bob Fosse, about the possibility of creating a musical adaptation. Fosse (himself a native of  Chicago) approached playwright Watkins numerous times to buy the rights, but she repeatedly declined; by this point she may have regretted that Annan and Gaertner had been allowed to walk free, and that her treatment of them should not be glamorized.<ref name=Grubb /> Nonetheless, upon her death in 1969, her [[Estate (law)|estate]] sold the rights to producer Richard Fryer, Verdon, and Fosse.<ref name=Grubb /> [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] began work on the musical score, modeling each number on a traditional [[vaudeville]] number or a vaudeville performer. This format made explicit the show's comparison between \"justice\", \"show-business\", and contemporary society. Ebb and Fosse penned the book of the musical, and Fosse also directed and [[choreography|choreographed]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n=== Act I ===\n[[Velma Kelly]] is a [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] who welcomes the audience to tonight's show (\"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\"). Interplayed with the opening number, the scene cuts to February 14, 1928 in the bedroom of chorus girl [[Roxie Hart]], where she murders Fred Casely as he attempts to break off an affair with her.\n\nRoxie convinces her husband Amos that the victim was a burglar, and Amos agrees to take the blame. Roxie expresses her appreciation of her husband's willingness to do anything for her (\"Funny Honey\"). However, when the police mention the deceased's name, Amos belatedly realizes that Roxie has lied to him. Roxie, feeling betrayed, confesses and is arrested. She is sent to the women's block in the [[Courthouse Place|Cook County Jail]], where several women accused of killing their lovers are held (\"[[Cell Block Tango]]\"); among the inmates is Velma Kelly, revealing herself to have been involved in the death of her husband and sister, though she denies committing the act. The block is presided over by Matron \"Mama\" Morton, whose system of taking [[bribery|bribes]] (\"When You're Good to Mama\") perfectly suits her clientele. She has helped Velma become the media's top murderer-of-the-week and is acting as a booking agent for Velma's big return to vaudeville.\n\nVelma is not happy to see Roxie, who is stealing not only her limelight but also her lawyer, [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Roxie convinces Amos to pay for Billy Flynn to be her lawyer (\"A Tap Dance\"), though Amos lacks the funds. Eagerly awaited by his all-woman clientele, Billy sings his anthem, complete with a chorus of fan dancers (\"All I Care About\"). Billy takes Roxie's case before realizing Amos doesn't have the money; to make up the difference, he turns the case into a [[media circus]] and rearranges her story for consumption by sympathetic tabloid columnist Mary Sunshine (\"A Little Bit of Good\"), hoping to sell proceeds in an auction. Roxie's press conference turns into a ventriloquist act, with Billy dictating a new version of the truth (\"We Both Reached for the Gun\") to the reporters while Roxie mouths the words.\n\nRoxie becomes the most popular celebrity in Chicago, as she boastfully proclaims while planning for her future career in vaudeville (\"Roxie\"). As Roxie's fame grows, Velma's notoriety subsides, and in an act of desperation she tries to talk Roxie into recreating the sister act (\"I Can't Do It Alone\"). Roxie turns her down, only to find her own headlines replaced by the latest sordid crime of passion (\"Chicago After Midnight\"). Separately, Roxie and Velma realize there is no one they can count on but themselves (\"My Own Best Friend\"), and Roxie decides that being pregnant in prison would put her back on the front page.\n\n===Act II===\nVelma returns to introduce the opening act, resentful of Roxie's manipulation of the system (\"I Know a Girl\") and ability to seduce a doctor into saying Roxie is pregnant; as Roxie emerges, she sings gleefully of the future of her unborn (nonexistent) child (\"Me and My Baby\"). Amos proudly claims paternity, but still, nobody notices him, and Billy exposes holes in Roxie's story by noting that she and Amos had not had sex in four months, meaning if she were pregnant, the child was not Amos's, in hopes that Amos will divorce her and look like a villain, which Amos almost does (\"Mr. Cellophane\"). Velma tries to show Billy all the tricks she has planned for her trial (\"When Velma Takes The Stand\"), which Roxie treats skeptically. Roxie, upset with being treated like a \"common criminal\" and considering herself a celebrity, has a heated argument with Billy and fires him; Billy warns her that her kind of [[15 minutes of fame|celebrity is fleeting]] and that she would be just as famous hanging from a noose. At that moment, Roxie witnesses one of her fellow inmates, a Hungarian woman who insisted her innocence but could not speak English and whose public lawyer refused to defend her, as she is hanged (\"Hungarian Rope Trick\").\n\nThe trial date arrives, and the now freshly terrified Roxie runs back to Billy, who calms Roxie by suggesting she will be fine so long as she makes a show of the trial (\"Razzle Dazzle\"). Billy uses Amos as a pawn, turning around and insisting that Amos is actually the father of Roxie's child. Roxie steals all of Velma's schtick, down to the rhinestone garter, to the dismay of Mama and Velma (\"Class\"). As promised, Billy gets Roxie acquitted, but just as the verdict is announced, some even more sensational crime pulls the press away, and Roxie's fleeting celebrity life is over. Billy leaves, done with the case, admitting that he only did it for the money. Amos tries to get Roxie to come home and forget the ordeal, but she is more concerned with the end of her brief run of fame and admits she isn't pregnant, leaving Amos in the dust.\n\nThe final scene cuts to a Chicago vaudeville theater, where Roxie and Velma (acquitted off-stage) are performing a new act in which they bittersweetly sing about modern life (\"Nowadays\"). The former Mary Sunshine, revealed during the trial to actually be a man in drag, takes his natural male form as a pushy vaudeville promoter, shaping Roxie and Velma's dance (\"Hot Honey Rag\") to make it as sexy as possible. The show ends with a brief finale (\"Finale\").<ref>Plot Summary based on that of Bill Rosenfield, copyright 1997 BMG Music</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n;1975 Original Broadway Production\n'''''\"Chicago: A Musical Vaudeville\"'''''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\" \u2013 Velma Kelly and Company\n* \"Funny Honey\" \u2013 Roxie Hart, Amos Hart, Sergeant Fogarty \n* \"[[Cell Block Tango]]\" \u2013 Velma and the Girls\n* \"When You're Good to Mama\" \u2013 Matron \"Mama\" Morton\n* \"Tap Dance\" - Roxie, Amos, and Boys\n* \"All I Care About\" \u2013 Billy Flynn and the Girls\n* \"A Little Bit of Good\" \u2013 Mary Sunshine\n* \"We Both Reached for the Gun\" \u2013 Billy, Roxie, Mary Sunshine\n* \"Roxie\" \u2013 Roxie and Boys\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Chicago After Midnight\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"My Own Best Friend\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 2\n* \"I Know a Girl\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Me and My Baby\" \u2013 Roxie and Company\n* \"Mr. Cellophane\" \u2013 Amos Hart\n* \"When Velma Takes the Stand\" \u2013 Velma and Boys\n* \"Razzle Dazzle\" \u2013 Billy and Company\n* \"Class\" \u2013 Velma and Morton\n* \"Nowadays\" \u2013 Roxie\n* Finale: \"Nowadays\"/\"R.S.V.P\"/\"Keep It Hot\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma \u2020\n{{col-end}}\n\n;1996 Revival Production\n'''''\"Chicago: The Musical\"'''''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\" \u2013 Velma Kelly and Company\n* \"Funny Honey\" \u2013 Roxie Hart\n* \"[[Cell Block Tango]]\" \u2013 Velma and the Murderesses\n* \"When You're Good to Mama\" \u2013 Matron \"Mama\" Morton\n* \"Tap Dance\" - Roxie, Amos, and Boys\n* \"All I Care About\" \u2013 Billy Flynn and the Girls\n* \"A Little Bit of Good\" \u2013 Mary Sunshine\n* \"We Both Reached for the Gun\" \u2013 Billy, Roxie, Mary and the Reporters\n* \"Roxie\" \u2013 Roxie and the Boys\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone (Reprise)\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Chicago After Midnight\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"My Own Best Friend\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma\n* \"Finale Act I: All That Jazz (Reprise)\" \u2013 Velma\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 2\n* \"Entr'acte\"  \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"I Know a Girl\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Me and My Baby\" \u2013 Roxie and Company\n* \"Mr. Cellophane\" \u2013 Amos Hart\n* \"When Velma Takes the Stand\" \u2013 Velma and the Boys\n* \"Razzle Dazzle\" \u2013 Billy and Company\n* \"Class\" \u2013 Velma and Mama Morton\n* \"Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag\" \u2013 Velma and Roxie\n* \"Finale Act II: All That Jazz (Reprise)\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n<small>\u2020 In the 1975 Original Broadway Production and its Playbill, there are a few contradicting song lists.

Every musical moment in the show was loosely modeled on someone else: Roxie was [[Helen Morgan]], Velma was [[Texas Guinan]], Billy Flynn was [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]], Mama Morton was [[Sophie Tucker]].\" Kander elaborates that the reason the show was called a vaudeville \"is because many of the songs we wrote are related to specific performers like those you mentioned, and Eddie Cantor and Bert Williams as well.\"<ref name=light>{{cite book|last1=Kander|first1=John|last2=Ebb|first2=Fred|last3=Lawrence|first3=Greg|title=Colored Lights: Forty Years of Words and Music, Show Biz, Collaboration, and All That Jazz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qJKRpOcNxE8C|date=October 2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-571-21169-2|pages=128\u2013129}}</ref>\n\nIt was through the initial production, and not the writing, that many of the \"traditional\" ''Chicago'' staging conventions were developed:\n\nThe double snap in \"Razzle Dazzle\" was added as an afterthought at the suggestion of Fred Ebb to John Kander. Kander explains: \"I remember when we wrote \"Razzle Dazzle\", before we took it in and played it for Bob, you [Ebb] said with absolute confidence 'Try adding a couple of finger snaps to it. Bobby will love that.' We added them...and as soon as he heard the finger snaps, he loved the song.\"<ref name=light/> During rehearsals, \"Razzle Dazzle\" was originally staged as an orgy on the steps of the courthouse. Fosse was talked out of allowing this staging, when Jerry Orbach \"convinced him that he was missing the Brechtian subtlety intrinsic in the number.\"<ref name=leve>Leve, James.

The piece was cut and replaced with \"Nowadays\". Instrumental sections of \"Loopin' the Loop\" can still be heard in the Overture.<ref name=leve/> Two other sections termed \"Keep It Hot\" and \"RSVP\" were cut from the finale as well.\n\nAnother principal character, a theatrical agent named Harry Glassman, was played by [[David Rounds]], whose role was to exploit the notoriety of the prisoners for his own gain. He also served as the evening's [[Master of Ceremonies|M.C]]. This character's role and the song \"Ten Percent\" was cut,<ref>Bloom, Ken; Vlastnik, Frank; and Orbach, Jerry.

Set in [[Chicago]] in the [[Jazz Age|jazz age]], the musical is based on a [[Chicago (play)|1926 play of the same name]] by reporter [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], about actual criminals and the crimes on which she reported. The story is a [[satire]] on [[Political corruption|corruption]] in the administration of [[criminal justice]] and the concept of the \"celebrity criminal\".\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened in 1975 at the [[46th Street Theatre]]<ref name=\"ChitaRivera.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chitarivera.com/productions/chicago.htm|title=Chicago|accessdate=January 6, 2009}}</ref> and ran for 936 performances, until 1977. Bob Fosse choreographed the original production, and his style is strongly identified with the show. It debuted in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1979, where it ran for 600 performances. ''Chicago'' was revived on Broadway in 1996, and a year later in the West End.\n\nThe 1996 Broadway production holds the record as the longest-running musical revival and the longest-running American musical in Broadway history. It is the second [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|longest-running show to ever run on Broadway]], behind only ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. ''Chicago'' surpassed ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' on November 23, 2014, when it played its 7,486th performance.<ref>Gans, Andrew. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/all-that-jazz-chicago-becomes-second-longest-running-broadway-show-tonight-335960 \"\"All That Jazz\": ''Chicago'' Becomes Second Longest-Running Broadway Show Tonight\"] Playbill.com, November 23, 2014</ref> The West End revival became the longest-running American musical in West End history. ''Chicago'' has been staged in numerous productions around the world, and has toured extensively in the United States and United Kingdom. The [[Chicago (2002 film)|2002 film version]] of the musical won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==History==\nThe musical ''Chicago'' is based on [[Chicago (play)|a play]] of the same name by reporter and playwright [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of accused murderers [[Beulah Annan]] and [[Belva Gaertner]] for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.  In the early 1920s, Chicago's press and public became riveted by the subject of homicides committed by women. Several high-profile cases arose, which generally involved women killing their lovers or husbands. These cases were tried against a backdrop of changing views of women in the [[jazz age]], and a long string of acquittals by [[Cook County]] juries of female murderers (juries at the time were all male, and convicted murderers generally faced death by hanging). A lore arose that, in Chicago, feminine or attractive women could not be convicted. The ''Chicago Tribune'' generally favored the prosecution's case, while still presenting the details of these women's lives. Its rivals at the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst papers]] were more pro-defendant, and employed what were derisively called \"sob-sisters\" \u2013 women reporters who focused on the plight, attractiveness, redemption, or grace of the female defendants. Regardless of stance, the press covered several of these women as celebrities.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Girls of Murder City: fame, lust, and the beautiful killers that inspired ''Chicago'' | publisher=Penguin Group /Viking Press |author=Perry, Douglas | year=2010 | location=New York | pages=1\u20137, 16\u201318, 57\u201358 | isbn=978-0-670-02197-0}}</ref>\n\nAnnan, the model for the character of [[Roxie Hart]], was 23 when she was accused of the April 3, 1924,<ref name=Grubb>{{cite book |title=Razzle Dazzle: The Life and Work of Bob Fosse |last=Grubb |first=Kevin Boyd |year=1989 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-03414-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/razzledazzlelife0000grub/page/193 193\u2013203] |url=https://archive.org/details/razzledazzlelife0000grub/page/193 }}</ref> murder of Harry Kalstedt, who served as the basis for the Fred Casely character.  The ''Tribune'' reported that Annan played the [[foxtrot]] record ''Hula Lou'' over and over for two hours before calling her husband to say she killed a man who \"tried to make love to her\".   Her husband Albert Annan inspired the character, Amos Hart. Albert was an auto mechanic who bankrupted himself to defend his wife, only for her to publicly dump him the day after she was acquitted. [[Velma Kelly]] is based on Gaertner, who was a cabaret singer, and society divorc\u00e9e. The body of Walter Law was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of Gaertner's abandoned car on March 12, 1924. Two police officers testified that they had seen a woman getting into the car and shortly thereafter heard gunshots. A bottle of gin and an automatic pistol were found on the floor of the car. Lawyers William Scott Stewart and W. W. O'Brien were models for a composite character in ''Chicago'', [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Just days apart, separate juries acquitted both women.<ref>McConnell, Virginia A.

The show received both good box-office sales and newspaper notices and was mounted on Broadway in 1926, running 172 performances. [[Cecil B. DeMille]] produced a [[silent film]] version, ''[[Chicago (1927 film)|Chicago]]'' (1927), starring former [[Mack Sennett]] bathing beauty [[Phyllis Haver]] as Roxie Hart. It was later remade as ''[[Roxie Hart (film)|Roxie Hart]]'' (1942) starring [[Ginger Rogers]], but in this version, Roxie was accused of murder without having really committed it.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Gwen Verdon]] read the play and asked her husband, Bob Fosse, about the possibility of creating a musical adaptation. Fosse (himself a native of  Chicago) approached playwright Watkins numerous times to buy the rights, but she repeatedly declined; by this point she may have regretted that Annan and Gaertner had been allowed to walk free, and that her treatment of them should not be glamorized.<ref name=Grubb /> Nonetheless, upon her death in 1969, her [[Estate (law)|estate]] sold the rights to producer Richard Fryer, Verdon, and Fosse.<ref name=Grubb /> [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] began work on the musical score, modeling each number on a traditional [[vaudeville]] number or a vaudeville performer. This format made explicit the show's comparison between \"justice\", \"show-business\", and contemporary society. Ebb and Fosse penned the book of the musical, and Fosse also directed and [[choreography|choreographed]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n=== Act I ===\n[[Velma Kelly]] is a [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] who welcomes the audience to tonight's show (\"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\"). Interplayed with the opening number, the scene cuts to February 14, 1928 in the bedroom of chorus girl [[Roxie Hart]], where she murders Fred Casely as he attempts to break off an affair with her.\n\nRoxie convinces her husband Amos that the victim was a burglar, and Amos agrees to take the blame. Roxie expresses her appreciation of her husband's willingness to do anything for her (\"Funny Honey\"). However, when the police mention the deceased's name, Amos belatedly realizes that Roxie has lied to him. Roxie, feeling betrayed, confesses and is arrested. She is sent to the women's block in the [[Courthouse Place|Cook County Jail]], where several women accused of killing their lovers are held (\"[[Cell Block Tango]]\"); among the inmates is Velma Kelly, revealing herself to have been involved in the death of her husband and sister, though she denies committing the act. The block is presided over by Matron \"Mama\" Morton, whose system of taking [[bribery|bribes]] (\"When You're Good to Mama\") perfectly suits her clientele. She has helped Velma become the media's top murderer-of-the-week and is acting as a booking agent for Velma's big return to vaudeville.\n\nVelma is not happy to see Roxie, who is stealing not only her limelight but also her lawyer, [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Roxie convinces Amos to pay for Billy Flynn to be her lawyer (\"A Tap Dance\"), though Amos lacks the funds. Eagerly awaited by his all-woman clientele, Billy sings his anthem, complete with a chorus of fan dancers (\"All I Care About\"). Billy takes Roxie's case before realizing Amos doesn't have the money; to make up the difference, he turns the case into a [[media circus]] and rearranges her story for consumption by sympathetic tabloid columnist Mary Sunshine (\"A Little Bit of Good\"), hoping to sell proceeds in an auction. Roxie's press conference turns into a ventriloquist act, with Billy dictating a new version of the truth (\"We Both Reached for the Gun\") to the reporters while Roxie mouths the words.\n\nRoxie becomes the most popular celebrity in Chicago, as she boastfully proclaims while planning for her future career in vaudeville (\"Roxie\"). As Roxie's fame grows, Velma's notoriety subsides, and in an act of desperation she tries to talk Roxie into recreating the sister act (\"I Can't Do It Alone\"). Roxie turns her down, only to find her own headlines replaced by the latest sordid crime of passion (\"Chicago After Midnight\"). Separately, Roxie and Velma realize there is no one they can count on but themselves (\"My Own Best Friend\"), and Roxie decides that being pregnant in prison would put her back on the front page.\n\n===Act II===\nVelma returns to introduce the opening act, resentful of Roxie's manipulation of the system (\"I Know a Girl\") and ability to seduce a doctor into saying Roxie is pregnant; as Roxie emerges, she sings gleefully of the future of her unborn (nonexistent) child (\"Me and My Baby\"). Amos proudly claims paternity, but still, nobody notices him, and Billy exposes holes in Roxie's story by noting that she and Amos had not had sex in four months, meaning if she were pregnant, the child was not Amos's, in hopes that Amos will divorce her and look like a villain, which Amos almost does (\"Mr. Cellophane\"). Velma tries to show Billy all the tricks she has planned for her trial (\"When Velma Takes The Stand\"), which Roxie treats skeptically. Roxie, upset with being treated like a \"common criminal\" and considering herself a celebrity, has a heated argument with Billy and fires him; Billy warns her that her kind of [[15 minutes of fame|celebrity is fleeting]] and that she would be just as famous hanging from a noose. At that moment, Roxie witnesses one of her fellow inmates, a Hungarian woman who insisted her innocence but could not speak English and whose public lawyer refused to defend her, as she is hanged (\"Hungarian Rope Trick\").\n\nThe trial date arrives, and the now freshly terrified Roxie runs back to Billy, who calms Roxie by suggesting she will be fine so long as she makes a show of the trial (\"Razzle Dazzle\"). Billy uses Amos as a pawn, turning around and insisting that Amos is actually the father of Roxie's child. Roxie steals all of Velma's schtick, down to the rhinestone garter, to the dismay of Mama and Velma (\"Class\"). As promised, Billy gets Roxie acquitted, but just as the verdict is announced, some even more sensational crime pulls the press away, and Roxie's fleeting celebrity life is over. Billy leaves, done with the case, admitting that he only did it for the money. Amos tries to get Roxie to come home and forget the ordeal, but she is more concerned with the end of her brief run of fame and admits she isn't pregnant, leaving Amos in the dust.\n\nThe final scene cuts to a Chicago vaudeville theater, where Roxie and Velma (acquitted off-stage) are performing a new act in which they bittersweetly sing about modern life (\"Nowadays\"). The former Mary Sunshine, revealed during the trial to actually be a man in drag, takes his natural male form as a pushy vaudeville promoter, shaping Roxie and Velma's dance (\"Hot Honey Rag\") to make it as sexy as possible. The show ends with a brief finale (\"Finale\").<ref>Plot Summary based on that of Bill Rosenfield, copyright 1997 BMG Music</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n;1975 Original Broadway Production\n'''''\"Chicago: A Musical Vaudeville\"'''''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\" \u2013 Velma Kelly and Company\n* \"Funny Honey\" \u2013 Roxie Hart, Amos Hart, Sergeant Fogarty \n* \"[[Cell Block Tango]]\" \u2013 Velma and the Girls\n* \"When You're Good to Mama\" \u2013 Matron \"Mama\" Morton\n* \"Tap Dance\" - Roxie, Amos, and Boys\n* \"All I Care About\" \u2013 Billy Flynn and the Girls\n* \"A Little Bit of Good\" \u2013 Mary Sunshine\n* \"We Both Reached for the Gun\" \u2013 Billy, Roxie, Mary Sunshine\n* \"Roxie\" \u2013 Roxie and Boys\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Chicago After Midnight\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"My Own Best Friend\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 2\n* \"I Know a Girl\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Me and My Baby\" \u2013 Roxie and Company\n* \"Mr. Cellophane\" \u2013 Amos Hart\n* \"When Velma Takes the Stand\" \u2013 Velma and Boys\n* \"Razzle Dazzle\" \u2013 Billy and Company\n* \"Class\" \u2013 Velma and Morton\n* \"Nowadays\" \u2013 Roxie\n* Finale: \"Nowadays\"/\"R.S.V.P\"/\"Keep It Hot\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma \u2020\n{{col-end}}\n\n;1996 Revival Production\n'''''\"Chicago: The Musical\"'''''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\" \u2013 Velma Kelly and Company\n* \"Funny Honey\" \u2013 Roxie Hart\n* \"[[Cell Block Tango]]\" \u2013 Velma and the Murderesses\n* \"When You're Good to Mama\" \u2013 Matron \"Mama\" Morton\n* \"Tap Dance\" - Roxie, Amos, and Boys\n* \"All I Care About\" \u2013 Billy Flynn and the Girls\n* \"A Little Bit of Good\" \u2013 Mary Sunshine\n* \"We Both Reached for the Gun\" \u2013 Billy, Roxie, Mary and the Reporters\n* \"Roxie\" \u2013 Roxie and the Boys\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone (Reprise)\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Chicago After Midnight\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"My Own Best Friend\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma\n* \"Finale Act I: All That Jazz (Reprise)\" \u2013 Velma\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 2\n* \"Entr'acte\"  \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"I Know a Girl\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Me and My Baby\" \u2013 Roxie and Company\n* \"Mr. Cellophane\" \u2013 Amos Hart\n* \"When Velma Takes the Stand\" \u2013 Velma and the Boys\n* \"Razzle Dazzle\" \u2013 Billy and Company\n* \"Class\" \u2013 Velma and Mama Morton\n* \"Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag\" \u2013 Velma and Roxie\n* \"Finale Act II: All That Jazz (Reprise)\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n<small>\u2020 In the 1975 Original Broadway Production and its Playbill, there are a few contradicting song lists.

Every musical moment in the show was loosely modeled on someone else: Roxie was [[Helen Morgan]], Velma was [[Texas Guinan]], Billy Flynn was [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]], Mama Morton was [[Sophie Tucker]].\" Kander elaborates that the reason the show was called a vaudeville \"is because many of the songs we wrote are related to specific performers like those you mentioned, and Eddie Cantor and Bert Williams as well.\"<ref name=light>{{cite book|last1=Kander|first1=John|last2=Ebb|first2=Fred|last3=Lawrence|first3=Greg|title=Colored Lights: Forty Years of Words and Music, Show Biz, Collaboration, and All That Jazz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qJKRpOcNxE8C|date=October 2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-571-21169-2|pages=128\u2013129}}</ref>\n\nIt was through the initial production, and not the writing, that many of the \"traditional\" ''Chicago'' staging conventions were developed:\n\nThe double snap in \"Razzle Dazzle\" was added as an afterthought at the suggestion of Fred Ebb to John Kander. Kander explains: \"I remember when we wrote \"Razzle Dazzle\", before we took it in and played it for Bob, you [Ebb] said with absolute confidence 'Try adding a couple of finger snaps to it. Bobby will love that.' We added them...and as soon as he heard the finger snaps, he loved the song.\"<ref name=light/> During rehearsals, \"Razzle Dazzle\" was originally staged as an orgy on the steps of the courthouse. Fosse was talked out of allowing this staging, when Jerry Orbach \"convinced him that he was missing the Brechtian subtlety intrinsic in the number.\"<ref name=leve>Leve, James.

The piece was cut and replaced with \"Nowadays\". Instrumental sections of \"Loopin' the Loop\" can still be heard in the Overture.<ref name=leve/> Two other sections termed \"Keep It Hot\" and \"RSVP\" were cut from the finale as well.\n\nAnother principal character, a theatrical agent named Harry Glassman, was played by [[David Rounds]], whose role was to exploit the notoriety of the prisoners for his own gain. He also served as the evening's [[Master of Ceremonies|M.C]]. This character's role and the song \"Ten Percent\" was cut,<ref>Bloom, Ken; Vlastnik, Frank; and Orbach, Jerry.

One of the original lyrics \"Every guy is a snot/Every girl is a twat\" was restored for the 2002 movie, although the entire number was cut from the final release of the movie.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n[[File:Michael O'Haughey and Jerry Orbach in Chicago musical.JPG|thumb|right| M.

{"title_page": "Interpretations of quantum mechanics", "text_new": "{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Interpretations}}\nAn '''interpretation of quantum mechanics''' is an attempt to explain how the mathematical theory of [[quantum mechanics]] \"corresponds\" to [[reality]]. Although quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and extremely precise tests in an extraordinarily broad range of experiments (not one prediction from quantum mechanics is found to be contradicted by experiments), there exist a number of contending schools of thought over their interpretation.  These views on interpretation differ on such fundamental questions as whether quantum mechanics is [[determinism|deterministic]] or [[stochastic|stochastic]], which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered real, and what is the nature of measurement, among other matters.\n\nDespite nearly a century of debate and experiment, no consensus has been reached among physicists and [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] concerning which interpretation best \"represents\" reality.<ref>\nMurray Gell-Mann - Quantum Mechanics Interpretations - Feynman Sum over Histories - EPR Bertlemann's\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-OFP5tNtMY\nRichard P Feynman: Quantum Mechanical View of Reality 1 (Part 1)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72us6pnbEvE\n</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schlosshauer|first=Maximilian|last2=Kofler|first2=Johannes|last3=Zeilinger|first3=Anton|date=2013-08-01|title=A snapshot of foundational attitudes toward quantum mechanics|url=|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=44|issue=3|pages=222\u2013230|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.04.004|issn=1355-2198|arxiv=1301.1069|bibcode=2013SHPMP..44..222S}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{multiple image\n| header            = Influential figures in the interpretation of quantum mechanics\n| header_align      = center<!-- left/right/ -->\n| header_background = #CCCCFF\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|image1=Erwin Schrodinger2.jpg\n|caption1=[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]\n|width1=150\n|image2=Max Born.jpg\n|caption2=[[Max Born|Born]]\n|width2=147\n|image3=Niels Bohr.jpg\n|caption3=[[Niels Bohr|Bohr]]\n|width3=135\n}}\nThe definition of quantum theorists' terms, such as ''[[wave function]]s'' and ''[[matrix mechanics]]'', progressed through many stages. For instance, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] originally viewed the electron's wave function as its charge density smeared across space, whereas [[Max Born]] reinterpreted the absolute square value of the wave function as the electron's [[probability density function|probability density]] distributed across space.\n\nThe views of several early pioneers of quantum mechanics, such as [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]], are often grouped together as the \"[[Copenhagen interpretation]]\", though physicists and historians of physics have argued that this terminology obscures differences between the views so designated.<ref name=\"jammer1974\">{{cite book|last=Jammer |first=Max |authorlink=Max Jammer |title=Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: The interpretations of quantum mechanics in historical perspective |url=https://archive.org/details/philosophyofquan0000jamm |url-access=registration |year=1974 |publisher=Wiley-Interscience}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Camilleri|first=Kristian|date=2009-02-01|title=Constructing the Myth of the Copenhagen Interpretation|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/259149|journal=Perspectives on Science|volume=17|issue=1|pages=26\u201357|issn=1530-9274|doi=10.1162/posc.2009.17.1.26}}</ref> While Copenhagen-type ideas were never universally embraced, challenges to a perceived Copenhagen orthodoxy gained increasing attention in the 1950s with the [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory|pilot-wave interpretation]] of [[David Bohm]] and the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[Hugh Everett III]].<ref name=\"jammer1974\"/><ref>[[Lev Vaidman|Vaidman, L.]] (2002, March 24).

The main conclusion of the authors is that \"the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] still reigns supreme\", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the [[many-worlds interpretations]]:\n:\"The  Copenhagen  interpretation  still  reigns  supreme  here,  especially  if  we  lump  it  together  with intellectual offsprings such as [[quantum information|information-based interpretations]] and the [[Quantum Bayesian]] interpretation.  In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll.\"\n\n== Nature ==\nMore or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:\n# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''\u2014a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions\n# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''\u2014a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world\nTwo qualities vary among interpretations:\n# [[Ontology]]\u2014claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world\n# [[Epistemology]]\u2014claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world\n\nIn [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''.  A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic).  A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic.  For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as a real existing ''maybe'' encoded in the universe (ontic).  Confusing the epistemic with the ontic, like if one were to presume that a general law actually \"governs\" outcomes\u2014and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism\u2014is a [[category mistake]].\n\nIn a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]\u2014approximately true description or explanation of the natural world\u2014or might be perceived with antirealism.  A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic.  In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.\n\n{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world.  The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], \"Shut up and calculate\", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase \"shut up and calculate\", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could Feynman have said this?|journal=[[Physics Today]]|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10\u201311|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N.

An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms\u2014[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]'s [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]\u2014has been demonstrated.\n\n== Interpretive challenges ==\n\n# Abstract, mathematical nature of [[quantum field theories]]: the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]] is mathematically abstract without clear interpretation of its quantities.\n# Existence of apparently [[quantum indeterminacy|indeterministic]] and irreversible processes: in [[classical field theory]], a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived.  In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement is given a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state. \n# Role of the [[observer (quantum physics)|observer]] in determining outcomes: the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] implies that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement, perhaps performed by an observer; Everettian interpretations grant that all the possibilities can be real, and that the process of measurement-type interactions cause an effective branching process.<ref>Guido Bacciagaluppi, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/qm-decoherence The role of decoherence in quantum mechanics]\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2012), Edward N Zalta, ed.</ref>\n# [[Quantum entanglement|Classically unexpected correlations]] between remote objects: [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum systems]], as illustrated in the [[EPR paradox]], obey statistics that seem to [[action at a distance (physics)|violate]] [[Principle of locality|principles of local causality]].<ref>''La nouvelle cuisine'', by John S Bell, last article of Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, second edition.</ref>\n# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system.  For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using propositional connectives (see \"[[Quantum logic]]\").  Like contextuality, the \"origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators\" that describe quantum objects (Omn\u00e8s 1999).\n# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.\n# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions in which properties of a system hold definite values, independent of the manner of their measurement, fails even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signalling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.\n\n== Influential Interpretations ==\n\n=== Other interpretations ===\n{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nAs well as the mainstream interpretations discussed below, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].\n\n=== The EPR Paradox ===\nThe current usage of realism and completeness originated in the 1935 paper in which Einstein and others proposed the [[EPR paradox]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Einstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Podolsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = N. | year = 1935 | title = Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete? | url =http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf | journal = Phys.

They characterised element of reality as a quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty before measuring or otherwise disturbing it, and defined a complete physical theory as one in which every element of physical reality is accounted for by the theory. In a semantic view of interpretation, an interpretation is complete if every element of the interpreting structure is present in the mathematics. Realism is also a property of each of the elements of the maths; an element is real if it corresponds to something in the interpreting structure. For example, in some interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as the many-worlds interpretation) the ket vector associated to the system state is said to correspond to an element of physical reality, while in other interpretations it is not.\n\nDeterminism is a property characterizing state changes due to the passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the state in the present (see [[time evolution]]). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.\n\nLocal realism has two aspects:\n* The value returned by a measurement corresponds to the value of some function in the state space. In other words, that value is an element of reality;\n* The effects of measurement have a propagation speed not exceeding some universal limit (e.g. the speed of light). In order for this to make sense, measurement operations in the interpreting structure must be localized.\n\nA precise formulation of local realism in terms of a [[local hidden-variable theory]] was proposed by [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]].\n\n[[Bell's theorem]], combined with experimental testing, restricts the kinds of properties a quantum theory can have, the primary implication being that quantum mechanics cannot satisfy both the [[locality principle|principle of locality]] and [[counterfactual definiteness]].\n\nRegardless of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or no attention to interpretational aspects.\n\n=== Copenhagen interpretation ===\n{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is the \"standard\" interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] while collaborating in Copenhagen around 1927. Bohr and Heisenberg extended the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction proposed originally by Max Born. The Copenhagen interpretation rejects questions like \"where was the particle before I measured its position?\" as meaningless. The measurement process randomly picks out exactly one of the many possibilities allowed for by the state's wave function in a manner consistent with the well-defined probabilities that are assigned to each possible state. According to the interpretation, the interaction of an observer or apparatus that is external to the quantum system is the cause of wave function collapse, thus according to [[Paul Davies]], \"reality is in the observations, not in the electron\".<ref>http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Heisenberg,Werner/Heisenberg,%20Werner%20-%20Physics%20and%20philosophy.pdf</ref> In general, after a measurement (click of a Geiger counter or a trajectory in a spark or bubble chamber) it ceases to be relevant unless subsequent experimental observations can be performed.\n\n=== Quantum information theories ===\n[[Quantum information]]al approaches<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.quantum.at/fileadmin/links/newscientist/bit.html\n | title=In the beginning was the bit\n | work=New Scientist\n | date=2001-02-17\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref> have attracted growing support.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.dailycamera.com/science-columnists/ci_22444536/kate-becker-quantum-physics-has-been-rankling-scientists\n | title=Quantum physics has been rankling scientists for decades\n | work=Boulder Daily Camera\n | author=Kate Becker\n | date=2013-01-25\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  They subdivide into two kinds.<ref>[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/iii_2.pdf Information, Immaterialism, Instrumentalism: Old and New in Quantum Information.] Christopher G.

Cit.: \"Let us call the thought that information might be the basic category from which all else flows informational immaterialism.\"</ref>\n* Interpretations where quantum mechanics is said to describe an observer's knowledge of the world, rather than the world itself. This approach has some similarity with Bohr's thinking.<ref>\"Physics concerns what we can say about nature\". (Niels Bohr, quoted in Petersen, A. (1963). The philosophy of Niels Bohr. ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', 19(7):8\u201314.)</ref> Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, rather than as an objective event. These approaches have been appraised as similar to [[instrumentalism]].\n<blockquote>\nThe state is not an objective property of an individual system but is that information, obtained from a knowledge of how a system was prepared, which can be used for making predictions about future measurements.\n...A quantum mechanical state being a summary of the observer's information about an individual physical system changes both by dynamical laws, and whenever the observer acquires new information about the system through the process of measurement. The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector...becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system...The \"reduction of the wavepacket\" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J.

Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of \"state\" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s).  The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system.  However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any \"measurement event\" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above.  Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-relational/\n |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu\n |date=\n |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref><ref>For more information, see {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02302261 |author=Carlo Rovelli |year=1996 |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1637\u20131678 |arxiv=quant-ph/9609002|bibcode = 1996IJTP...35.1637R |authorlink= Carlo Rovelli }}</ref>\n\nAn independent [[Relational approach to quantum physics|relational approach to quantum mechanics]] was developed in analogy with David Bohm's elucidation of special relativity,<ref>David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', Benjamin, New York, 1965</ref> in which a detection event is regarded as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector.

This interpretation is distinguished by its use of a [[Bayesian probability#Dutch book approach|subjective Bayesian]] account of probabilities to understand the quantum mechanical [[Born rule]] as a [[normative]] addition to good decision-making. QBism draws from the fields of [[quantum information]] and [[Bayesian probability]] and aims to eliminate the interpretational conundrums that have beset quantum theory.\n\nQBism deals with common questions in the interpretation of quantum theory about the nature of [[wavefunction]] [[Quantum superposition|superposition]], [[Measurement problem|quantum measurement]], and [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]].<ref name=\":21\">{{cite journal|last=Timpson|first=Christopher Gordon|year=2008|title=Quantum Bayesianism: A study|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/qb_s.ps|format=postscript|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=39|issue=3|pages=579\u2013609|arxiv=0804.2047|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2008.03.006|via=|accessdate=|bibcode=2008SHPMP..39..579T}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mermin|first=N.

The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment producing [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], repeatedly \"splitting\" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories\u2014effectively distinct universes within a greater [[multiverse]].\n\n=== Consistent histories ===\n{{Main|Consistent histories}}\n\nThe [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\nAccording to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).\n\n=== Ensemble interpretation ===\n{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}\n\nThe [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system{{spaced ndash}}for example, a single particle{{spaced ndash}}but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles.

Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction.  The wavefunction evolves according to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]], and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single space-time, is [[Principle of locality|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint.

Cramer]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics inspired by the [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/qm_nl.html\n |title       = Quantum Nocality \u2013 Cramer\n |publisher   = Npl.washington.edu\n |accessdate  = 2011-01-24\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101229074514/http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/qm_nl.html\n |archivedate = 2010-12-29\n}}</ref> It describes the collapse of the wave function as resulting from a time-symmetric transaction between a possibility wave from the source to the receiver (the wave function) and a possibility wave from the receiver to source (the complex conjugate of the wave function).  This interpretation of quantum mechanics is unique in that it not only views the wave function as a real entity, but the complex conjugate of the wave function, which appears in the Born rule for calculating the expected value for an observable, as also real.\n\n=== Stochastic mechanics ===\n{{Main|Stochastic interpretation}}\nAn entirely classical derivation and interpretation of Schr\u00f6dinger's wave equation by analogy with [[Brownian motion]] was suggested by [[Princeton University]] professor [[Edward Nelson]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = E | year = 1966 | title = Derivation of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation from Newtonian Mechanics | url = | journal = Phys.

F\u00fcrth (1933), [[I. F\u00e9nyes]] (1952), and [[Walter Weizel]] (1953), and are referenced in Nelson's paper. More recent work on the stochastic interpretation has been done by M.

In objective theories, collapse occurs either randomly (\"spontaneous localization\") or when some physical threshold is reached, with observers having no special role.  Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories.  Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; QM would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct. The requirement for an extension to QM means that objective collapse is more of a theory than an interpretation.

He concluded that the entire physical universe could be made subject to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (the universal wave function). He also described how measurement could cause a collapse of the wave function.<ref>von Neumann, John. (1932/1955). ''Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. Translated by Robert T.

This research area and its name originated in the 1936 paper by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], who attempted to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical boolean logic with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Modal interpretations of quantum theory ===\nModal interpretations of quantum mechanics were first conceived of in 1972 by B. van Fraassen, in his paper \"A formal approach to the philosophy of science.\"  However, this term now is used to describe a larger set of models that grew out of this approach. The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] describes several versions:<ref>{{cite journal\n|url=http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/qm-modal/\n |title=Modal Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics\n |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n |publisher=Science.uva.nl\n |date=2002-11-12\n |accessdate=2011-01-24|last1=Lombardi\n |first1=Olimpia\n |last2=Dieks\n |first2=Dennis\n }}</ref>\n* The Copenhagen variant\n* Kochen-[[Dennis Dieks|Dieks]]-Healey Interpretations\n* Motivating Early Modal Interpretations, based on the work of R.

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future.  In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times.  The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement.  Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality.  The point where two particles appear to \"become entangled\" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.\n\nNot all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, states that the two-state vector formalism dovetails well with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].<ref>Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''.

It also has some resemblance to hidden-variable theories and the ensemble interpretation: particles in BST have multiple well defined trajectories at the microscopic level. These can only be treated stochastically at a coarse grained level, in line with the ensemble interpretation.<ref name=\"Sharlow\">[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3781/1/what_branching_spacetime_might_do.pdf Sharlow, Mark; \"What Branching Spacetime might do for Physics\"] p.2</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nThe most common interpretations are summarized in the table below.

To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality; difficulties arise only when one attempts to \"interpret\" the theory.  Nevertheless, designing experiments which would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.\n\nMost of these interpretations have variants. For example, it is difficult to get a precise definition of the Copenhagen interpretation as it was developed and argued about by many people.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The main conclusion of the authors is that \"the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] still reigns supreme\", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the [[many-worlds interpretations]]:\n:\"The  Copenhagen  interpretation  still  reigns  supreme  here,  especially  if  we  lump  it  together  with intellectual offsprings such as [[quantum information|information-based interpretations]] and the [[Quantum Bayesian]] interpretation.  In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll.\"\n\n== Nature ==\nMore or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:\n# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''\u2014a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions\n# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''\u2014a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world\nTwo qualities vary among interpretations:\n# [[Ontology]]\u2014claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world\n# [[Epistemology]]\u2014claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world\n\nIn [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''.  A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic).  A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic.  For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as a real existing ''maybe'' encoded in the universe (ontic).  Confusing the epistemic with the ontic, like if one were to presume that a general law actually \"governs\" outcomes\u2014and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism\u2014is a [[category mistake]].\n\nIn a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]\u2014approximately true description or explanation of the natural world\u2014or might be perceived with antirealism.  A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic.  In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.\n\n{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world.  The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], \"Shut up and calculate\", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase \"shut up and calculate\", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could Feynman have said this?|journal=[[Physics Today]]|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10\u201311|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N.

An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms\u2014[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]'s [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]\u2014has been demonstrated.\n\n== Interpretive challenges ==\n\n# Abstract, mathematical nature of [[quantum field theories]]: the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]] is mathematically abstract without clear interpretation of its quantities.\n# Existence of apparently [[quantum indeterminacy|indeterministic]] and irreversible processes: in [[classical field theory]], a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived.  In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement is given a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state. \n# Role of the [[observer (quantum physics)|observer]] in determining outcomes: the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] implies that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement, perhaps performed by an observer; Everettian interpretations grant that all the possibilities can be real, and that the process of measurement-type interactions cause an effective branching process.<ref>Guido Bacciagaluppi, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/qm-decoherence The role of decoherence in quantum mechanics]\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2012), Edward N Zalta, ed.</ref>\n# [[Quantum entanglement|Classically unexpected correlations]] between remote objects: [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum systems]], as illustrated in the [[EPR paradox]], obey statistics that seem to [[action at a distance (physics)|violate]] [[Principle of locality|principles of local causality]].<ref>''La nouvelle cuisine'', by John S Bell, last article of Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, second edition.</ref>\n# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system.  For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using propositional connectives (see \"[[Quantum logic]]\").  Like contextuality, the \"origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators\" that describe quantum objects (Omn\u00e8s 1999).\n# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.\n# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions in which properties of a system hold definite values, independent of the manner of their measurement, fails even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signalling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.\n\n== Influential Interpretations ==\n\n=== Other interpretations ===\n{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nAs well as the mainstream interpretations discussed below, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].\n\n=== The EPR Paradox ===\nThe current usage of realism and completeness originated in the 1935 paper in which Einstein and others proposed the [[EPR paradox]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Einstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Podolsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = N. | year = 1935 | title = Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete? | url =http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf | journal = Phys.

They characterised element of reality as a quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty before measuring or otherwise disturbing it, and defined a complete physical theory as one in which every element of physical reality is accounted for by the theory. In a semantic view of interpretation, an interpretation is complete if every element of the interpreting structure is present in the mathematics. Realism is also a property of each of the elements of the maths; an element is real if it corresponds to something in the interpreting structure. For example, in some interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as the many-worlds interpretation) the ket vector associated to the system state is said to correspond to an element of physical reality, while in other interpretations it is not.\n\nDeterminism is a property characterizing state changes due to the passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the state in the present (see [[time evolution]]). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.\n\nLocal realism has two aspects:\n* The value returned by a measurement corresponds to the value of some function in the state space. In other words, that value is an element of reality;\n* The effects of measurement have a propagation speed not exceeding some universal limit (e.g. the speed of light). In order for this to make sense, measurement operations in the interpreting structure must be localized.\n\nA precise formulation of local realism in terms of a [[local hidden-variable theory]] was proposed by [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]].\n\n[[Bell's theorem]], combined with experimental testing, restricts the kinds of properties a quantum theory can have, the primary implication being that quantum mechanics cannot satisfy both the [[locality principle|principle of locality]] and [[counterfactual definiteness]].\n\nRegardless of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or no attention to interpretational aspects.\n\n=== Copenhagen interpretation ===\n{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is the \"standard\" interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] while collaborating in Copenhagen around 1927. Bohr and Heisenberg extended the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction proposed originally by Max Born. The Copenhagen interpretation rejects questions like \"where was the particle before I measured its position?\" as meaningless. The measurement process randomly picks out exactly one of the many possibilities allowed for by the state's wave function in a manner consistent with the well-defined probabilities that are assigned to each possible state. According to the interpretation, the interaction of an observer or apparatus that is external to the quantum system is the cause of wave function collapse, thus according to [[Paul Davies]], \"reality is in the observations, not in the electron\".<ref>http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Heisenberg,Werner/Heisenberg,%20Werner%20-%20Physics%20and%20philosophy.pdf</ref> In general, after a measurement (click of a Geiger counter or a trajectory in a spark or bubble chamber) it ceases to be relevant unless subsequent experimental observations can be performed.\n\n=== Quantum information theories ===\n[[Quantum information]]al approaches<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.quantum.at/fileadmin/links/newscientist/bit.html\n | title=In the beginning was the bit\n | work=New Scientist\n | date=2001-02-17\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref> have attracted growing support.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.dailycamera.com/science-columnists/ci_22444536/kate-becker-quantum-physics-has-been-rankling-scientists\n | title=Quantum physics has been rankling scientists for decades\n | work=Boulder Daily Camera\n | author=Kate Becker\n | date=2013-01-25\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  They subdivide into two kinds.<ref>[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/iii_2.pdf Information, Immaterialism, Instrumentalism: Old and New in Quantum Information.] Christopher G.

These approaches have been appraised as similar to [[instrumentalism]].\n<blockquote>\nThe state is not an objective property of an individual system but is that information, obtained from a knowledge of how a system was prepared, which can be used for making predictions about future measurements.\n...A quantum mechanical state being a summary of the observer's information about an individual physical system changes both by dynamical laws, and whenever the observer acquires new information about the system through the process of measurement. The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector...becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system...The \"reduction of the wavepacket\" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J.

Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of \"state\" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s).  The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system.  However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any \"measurement event\" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above.  Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-relational/\n |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu\n |date=\n |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref><ref>For more information, see {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02302261 |author=Carlo Rovelli |year=1996 |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1637\u20131678 |arxiv=quant-ph/9609002|bibcode = 1996IJTP...35.1637R |authorlink= Carlo Rovelli }}</ref>\n\nAn independent [[Relational approach to quantum physics|relational approach to quantum mechanics]] was developed in analogy with David Bohm's elucidation of special relativity,<ref>David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', Benjamin, New York, 1965</ref> in which a detection event is regarded as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector.

This interpretation is distinguished by its use of a [[Bayesian probability#Dutch book approach|subjective Bayesian]] account of probabilities to understand the quantum mechanical [[Born rule]] as a [[normative]] addition to good decision-making. QBism draws from the fields of [[quantum information]] and [[Bayesian probability]] and aims to eliminate the interpretational conundrums that have beset quantum theory.\n\nQBism deals with common questions in the interpretation of quantum theory about the nature of [[wavefunction]] [[Quantum superposition|superposition]], [[Measurement problem|quantum measurement]], and [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]].<ref name=\":21\">{{cite journal|last=Timpson|first=Christopher Gordon|year=2008|title=Quantum Bayesianism: A study|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/qb_s.ps|format=postscript|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=39|issue=3|pages=579\u2013609|arxiv=0804.2047|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2008.03.006|via=|accessdate=|bibcode=2008SHPMP..39..579T}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mermin|first=N.

The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment producing [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], repeatedly \"splitting\" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories\u2014effectively distinct universes within a greater [[multiverse]].\n\n=== Consistent histories ===\n{{Main|Consistent histories}}\n\nThe [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\nAccording to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).\n\n=== Ensemble interpretation ===\n{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}\n\nThe [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system{{spaced ndash}}for example, a single particle{{spaced ndash}}but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles.

Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction.  The wavefunction evolves according to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]], and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single space-time, is [[Principle of locality|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint. The theory is considered to be a [[hidden-variable theory]], and by embracing non-locality it satisfies Bell's inequality.

It was proposed in 2003 by [[Wojciech Zurek]] and a group of collaborators including Ollivier, Poulin, Paz and Blume-Kohout.

Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories.  Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; QM would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct.

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future.  In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times.  The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement.  Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality.  The point where two particles appear to \"become entangled\" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.\n\nNot all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics.

To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality; difficulties arise only when one attempts to \"interpret\" the theory.  Nevertheless, designing experiments which would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.\n\nMost of these interpretations have variants. For example, it is difficult to get a precise definition of the Copenhagen interpretation as it was developed and argued about by many people.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

In the summer of 2003, Lundin Petroleum sold its working interest in [[Block 5A, South Sudan|Block 5A]] to [[Petronas]] Carigali for US$142.5 million. In 1998 the company discovered the En Naga North and West field in southern part of the [[Sirte Basin]], [[Libya]]. After a successful appraisal program in 1998 and 1999 the field was declared. The commercial and development program commenced. Development included the construction of a central production facility, 100&nbsp;km pipeline together with the drilling of 20 production, 15 injector and 15 water supply wells. Recoverable reserves were estimated to be approximately {{convert|100|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=off|lk=on}} of [[oil equivalent]]. In [[Tunisia]], the Oudna field development (Lundin Petroleum 40% working interest) was successfully completed and production commenced in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lundin-petroleum.com/Documents/ar_2006_e.pdf |title=Annual Report 2006 |publisher=Lundin Petroleum |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Lundin Petroleum acquired Coparex International from BNP Paribas, adding exploration and production assets in France, Netherlands, Tunisia, Venezuela, Indonesia and Albania to the existing portfolio. The acquisition transformed Lundin Petroleum from a pure exploration company into a larger E&P player. In early 2003, Lundin Petroleum entered Norway for the first time by acquiring 75 percent of the shareholding in Norwegian OER oil.<ref name=\"History\"/> In 2004, Lundin Petroleum acquired a portfolio of producing assets in the UK from DNO AS, doubling Lundin Petroleum's reserves to {{convert|138|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=unit|order=flip}} of oil equivalent and increased production to {{convert|28,900|oilbbl|m3|order=flip}} per day of oil equivalent.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn April 2010 it [[demerger|demerged]] its assets on the [[United Kingdom Continental Shelf]] into [[Petrofac]]'s Energy Developments unit to form the stand-alone company [[EnQuest]].\n\nIn 2010, Lundin Petroleum made a large discovery on the Avaldsnes prospect in PL501 on the Utsira High in the North Sea, estimated to contain recoverable resources of {{convert|100|to|400|e6oilbbl|e6m3|order=flip|abbr=unit}} of oil equivalent.
