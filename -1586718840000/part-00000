A fourth person, Mark Haydon, was convicted for helping to dispose of the bodies. The trial was one of the longest and most publicised in [[Australia]]n legal history.\n\nMost of the bodies were found in [[barrels]] in an abandoned [[bank vault]] in [[Snowtown, South Australia|Snowtown]], hence the names given in the press for the murders. Only one of the victims was killed in Snowtown itself, which is approximately {{convert|140|km|abbr=off}} north of [[Adelaide]], and neither the eleven victims nor the three perpetrators were from the town. Although motivation for the murders is unclear, the killers were led by Bunting to believe that the victims were [[Pedophilia|paedophiles]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], or \"weak\". In the case of some victims, the murders were preceded by torture, and efforts were made to appropriate victims' identities, [[social security]] payments and bank accounts.\n\nAlthough initially the notoriety of the murders led to a short-term economic boost from tourists visiting Snowtown, it created a lasting stigma, with authorities considering a change of the town's name and identity.\n\n==Investigation==\nInitially, the body of Clinton Trezise was found at [[Lower Light, South Australia|Lower Light]] in 1994,<ref name=\"Newton2006\"/> although no connection to Bunting was made at this time. Similarly, the death of Thomas Trevilyan in 1997 was initially treated as a [[suicide]]. It was police inquiries into Elizabeth Haydon's disappearance which eventually led them to Snowtown, and on 20 May 1999, the remains of eight victims were found by the [[South Australia Police|South Australian Police]] in six plastic barrels in a disused bank vault.<ref name=\"sentencing\"/> For this reason, the murders were dubbed the \"bodies in barrels murders\".<ref name=\"haydon trial\"/>\n\nIt is believed that the bodies had been held in several locations in South Australia before being moved to Snowtown in 1999. Prosecutors believe that the killers moved the bodies after they became aware of the ongoing police investigation. Two more bodies were found buried in the backyard of Bunting's house in Adelaide.<ref name=\"sentencing\"/> Police later arrested and charged Bunting, Wagner, Vlassakis and Mark Haydon on 21 May 1999 for the murders. At the time of the arrest, Vlassakis lived in Bunting's home.<ref name=\"Newton2006\"/>\n\n==Trials and verdicts==\nThe trial of Bunting and Wagner lasted almost twelve months, the longest in the history of South Australia.

A fourth person, Mark Haydon, was convicted for helping to dispose of the bodies. The trial was one of the longest and most publicised in [[Australia]]n legal history.\n\nMost of the bodies were found in [[barrels]] in an abandoned [[bank vault]] in [[Snowtown, South Australia|Snowtown]], hence the names given in the press for the murders. Only one of the victims was killed in Snowtown itself, which is approximately {{convert|140|km|abbr=off}} north of [[Adelaide]], and neither the eleven victims nor the three perpetrators were from the town. Although motivation for the murders is unclear, the killers were led by Bunting to believe that the victims were [[Pedophilia|paedophiles]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], or \"weak\". In the case of some victims, the murders were preceded by torture, and efforts were made to appropriate victims' identities, [[social security]] payments and bank accounts.\n\nAlthough initially the notoriety of the murders led to a short-term economic boost from tourists visiting Snowtown, it created a lasting stigma, with authorities considering a change of the town's name and identity.\n\n==Investigation==\nInitially, the body of Clinton Trezise was found at [[Lower Light, South Australia|Lower Light]] in 1994,<ref name=\"Newton2006\"/> although no connection to Bunting was made at this time. Similarly, the death of Thomas Trevilyan in 1997 was initially treated as a [[suicide]]. It was police inquiries into Elizabeth Haydon's disappearance which eventually led them to Snowtown, and on 20 May 1999, the remains of eight victims were found by the [[South Australia Police|South Australian Police]] in six plastic barrels in a disused bank vault.<ref name=\"sentencing\"/> For this reason, the murders were dubbed the \"bodies in barrels murders\".<ref name=\"haydon trial\"/>\n\nIt is believed that the bodies had been held in several locations in South Australia before being moved to Snowtown in 1999. Prosecutors believe that the killers moved the bodies after they became aware of the ongoing police investigation. Two more bodies were found buried in the backyard of Bunting's house in Adelaide.<ref name=\"sentencing\"/> Police later arrested and charged Bunting, Wagner, Vlassakis and Mark Haydon on 21 May 1999 for the murders. At the time of the arrest, Vlassakis lived in Bunting's home.<ref name=\"Newton2006\"/>\n\n==Trials and verdicts==\nThe trial of Bunting and Wagner lasted almost twelve months, the longest in the history of South Australia.

{"title_page": "Selective area epitaxy", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=December 2016}}\n'''Selective area epitaxy''' is the local growth of [[epitaxy|epitaxial]] layer through a patterned amorphous [[dielectric]] mask (typically [[Silicon dioxide|SiO<sub>2</sub>]] or Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) deposited on a [[semiconductor]] substrate. Semiconductor growth conditions are selected to ensure epitaxial growth on the exposed substrate, but not on the dielectric mask.\nSAE is formed by opening seed windows on an oxidized semiconductor substrate which can have different crystal orientation.  Epitaxial growth is initiated selectively in the seed windows on the exposed regions. The growth is referred to as Selective Epitaxial Growth (SEG) when the growth is confined within the oxide walls, and until it reaches the level of the oxide. If the growth is continued after reaching the level of the oxide it continues to grow as a faceted growth. In faceted growth, the growth direction and the shape of the semiconductor structure depends on the growth rates of different facets. The growth rates of different facets can be tuned by adjusting the growth conditions such as temperature and V/III ratio of precursor flows. By this way, nanostructures with fully vertical sidewalls such as nanowires or layers grown on the oxide can be manufactured. The latter technique is called Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth (ELO). \n\nFACTORS EFFECTING SAE\n# Temperature of growth\n# Choice of mask material\n# Orientation of window\n# Mask to window ratio\n# Influence of etchant\n# Quality of mask\n# Influence of shape of window\n\n\n[[Category:Semiconductor device fabrication]]\n\n\n{{Chem-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=December 2016}}\n'''Selective area epitaxy''' is the local growth of [[epitaxy|epitaxial]] layer through a patterned amorphous [[dielectric]] mask (typically [[Silicon dioxide|SiO<sub>2</sub>]] or Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) deposited on a [[semiconductor]] substrate. Semiconductor growth conditions are selected to ensure epitaxial growth on the exposed substrate, but not on the dielectric mask.\nSAE is formed by opening seed windows on an oxidized Silicon substrate which is typically < 100 > in orientation. The seed window edges are aligned at 45\" to the wafer flat, and are along the [100] direction. Epitaxial growth is initiated selectively in the seed windows on the exposed regions. The growth is referred to as Selective Epitaxial Growth (SEG) when the Silicon is confined within the oxide walls, and until it reaches the level of the oxide. If the growth is continued, the Silicon grows out of the seed hole and laterally over the masking oxide to produce a single crystal layer of Silicon called Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth (ELO)\n\nFACTORS EFFECTING SAE\n# Temperature of growth\n# Choice of mask material\n# Orientation of window\n# Mask to window ratio\n# Influence of etchant\n# Quality of mask\n# Influence of shape of window\n\n\n[[Category:Semiconductor device fabrication]]\n\n\n{{Chem-stub}}\n", "name_user": "SimoHoeglund", "label": "safe", "comment": "I changed the introduction a bit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_area_epitaxy"}
