In 1994, 3rd Corps of Tactical Aviation was created. The newest fighter in the [[Czechoslovak Air Force]] arsenal was the [[MiG-29]] (Izdelie 9.12). As there was only one general maintenance kit, which was given to newly created [[Slovak Republic]], and all the material was split 1:1 with Slovakia, maintenance costs for the Czech Fulcrums would be too high. Along with the unreasonably high costs, speculative costs for spare parts imported from Russia, which were realised through third-party companies ([[Mil Mi-24]] rotor blades acquisitions were over-priced by 400%),{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=December 2017}} led to exchange of 10 MiG-29s with Poland for [[PZL W-3]]A Sok\u00f3\u0142 rescue helicopters with avionics and ground support. Therefore, 10 air superiority fighters were exchanged for 11 light helicopters and this acquisition became a strongly discussed affair around a half of 90s.<ref>{{cite journal|title=W-3A Sokol helicopters in the Czech Air Force service|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2012|page=43}}</ref> The burden of readiness squadron passed to the [[MiG-23]]s.\n\nThe new-era Air Force of the Czech Army was effectively formed on 1 July 1997 when the 3rd Corps of Tactical Aviation and the 4th Air Defence Corps were united.

The second mission of the task force took place from 1 September 2012 until 4 January 2013. The main task of the Baltic Air Policing 2012 mission was to ensure protection of the [[airspace]] over the land and water territory of the three [[Baltic states]] \u2013 [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]]. The whole mission was a part of NATINADS, operating from the [[\u0160iauliai Air Base]] in Lithuania. Remaining Czech Air Force Gripens were also in a [[24/7 service|24/7 readiness]] on their home base at [[\u010c\u00e1slav]]. As in 2009, also during the 2012 Baltic mission the targets of [[Scrambling (military)|Alpha scrambles]] were [[Russian Air Force|Russian military]] aircraft that failed to observe the flight rules of the [[Airway (aviation)|civilian air corridors]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=In Baltic successfully again|journal=Czech Air Force Yearbook 2013|page=44}}</ref>\n\n===Sinai Peninsula===\n[[File:CASA C-295 (Czech Air Force) (15094753595).jpg|right|thumb|Czech CASA C-295M]]\nOne of the most important tasks of the Czech [[Military transport aircraft|military transport]] aviation in recent years is to provide support to the international [[Multinational Force and Observers]] (MFO) [[Peacekeeping|peace mission]] at the [[Sinai Peninsula]].

Alcott quickly completed a second volume (titled '''''Good Wives''''' in the United Kingdom, although this name originated from the publisher and not from Alcott), and it was also successful. The two volumes were issued in 1880 as a single novel titled ''Little Women.''\n\nAlcott wrote two sequels to her popular work, both of which also featured the March sisters: ''[[Little Men]]'' (1871) and ''[[Jo's Boys]]'' (1886). The novel addresses three major themes: \"domesticity, work, and true love, all of them interdependent and each necessary to the achievement of its heroine's individual identity.\"<ref name=Elbert>{{cite book |author=Elbert, Sarah |title=A Hunger for Home: Louisa May Alcott's Place in American Culture |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick |year=1987 |isbn=0-8135-1199-2}}</ref>{{rp|200}} According to [[Sarah Elbert]], Alcott created a new form of literature, one that took elements from Romantic children's fiction and combined it with others from sentimental novels, resulting in a totally new format. Elbert argues that within ''Little Women'' can be found the first vision of the \"[[Girl next door|All-American girl]]\" and that her various aspects are embodied in the differing March sisters.<ref name=Elbert />{{rp|199}}\n\nThe book has frequently been adapted for stage and screen.\n\n==Development history==\nIn 1868, Thomas Niles, the publisher of Louisa May Alcott, recommended that she write a book about girls that would have widespread appeal.<ref name=Cheever>{{cite book|last=Cheever|first=Susan |title=Louisa May Alcott: A Personal Biography |year=2011 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1416569923 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4PYzxTQVAcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=little%20women}}</ref>{{rp|2}} At first she resisted, preferring to publish a collection of her short stories.

Having lost all his money, their father is acting as a [[pastor]] in the [[American Civil War]], far from home. The women face their first Christmas without him.\n\nMeg and Jo March, the elder two, have to work in order to support the family: Meg teaches a nearby family of four children;  Jo assists her aged [[great-aunt]] March, a wealthy widow living in a [[mansion]], Plumfield. Beth, too timid for school, is content to stay at home and help with housework; Amy is still at school. Meg is beautiful and traditional, Jo is a tomboy who writes; Beth is a peacemaker and a pianist; Amy is an artist who longs for elegance and fine society.\n\nJo is impulsive and quick to anger. One of her challenges is trying to control her anger, a challenge that her mother experiences. She advises Jo to speak with forethought before leaving to travel to [[Washington, DC|Washington]], where her husband has [[pneumonia]].\n\nTheir neighbor, Mr. Laurence, who is charmed by Beth, gives her a piano. Beth contracts [[scarlet fever]] after spending time with a poor family where three children die. Jo tends Beth in her illness. Beth recovers, but never fully. As a precaution, Amy is sent to live with Aunt March, replacing Jo, while Beth is ill and still infectious.\n\nJo has success in earning money with her writing. Meg spends two weeks with friends, where there are parties for the girls to dance with boys and improve their social skills. Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence, Mr. Laurence's grandson, is invited to one of the dances, as Meg's friends incorrectly think she is in love with him. Meg is more interested in John Brooke, Laurie's young tutor. Brooke goes to Washington to help Mr. March. While with the March parents, Brooke confesses his love for Meg. They are pleased but consider Meg too young to be married. Brooke agrees to wait.  He [[enlist]]s and serves a year or so in the war. After he is wounded, he returns to find work so he can buy a house ready for when he marries Meg. Laurie goes off to college. On Christmas Day, a year after the book's opening, the girls' father returns from the war.\n\n===Part Two===\n(Published separately in the United Kingdom as ''Good Wives'')\n\nThree years later, Meg and John marry and learn how to live together. When they have twins, Meg is a devoted mother but John begins to feel left out. Laurie graduates from college, having put in the effort to do well in his last year with Jo's prompting. Amy goes on a European tour with her aunt. Beth's health is weak and her spirits are down. When trying to uncover the reason for Beth's sadness, Jo realizes that Laurie has fallen in love. At first she believes it's with Beth but soon senses it's with herself. Jo confides in Marmee, telling her that she loves Laurie but she loves him like a brother and that she could not love him in a romantic way.\n\nJo decides she wants a bit of adventure and to put distance between herself and Laurie, hoping he will forget his feelings. She spends six months with a friend of her mother in New York City, serving as [[governess]] for her two children. The family runs a boarding house. She takes German lessons with Professor Bhaer, who lives in the house. He has come to America from Berlin to care for the orphaned sons of his sister. For extra money, Jo writes stories without a moral, which disappoints Bhaer. He persuades her to give up poorly written sensational stories as her time in New York comes to an end. When she returns, Laurie proposes marriage and she declines.\n\nLaurie travels to Europe with his grandfather to escape his heartbreak. At home, Beth's health has seriously deteriorated. Jo devotes her time to the care of her dying sister. Laurie encounters Amy in Europe, and he slowly falls in love with her as he begins to see her in a new light. She is unimpressed by the aimless, idle and forlorn attitude he has adopted since being rejected by Jo, and inspires him to find his purpose and do something worthwhile with his life. With the news of Beth's death, they meet for consolation and their romance grows. Amy's aunt will not allow Amy to return with just Laurie and his grandfather, so they marry before returning home from Europe.\n\nProfessor Bhaer goes to the Marches' and stays for two weeks. On his last day, he proposes to Jo. Jo accepts. When Aunt March dies, she leaves Plumfield to Jo. Jo and Bhaer turn the house into a school for boys. They have two sons of their own, and Amy and Laurie have a daughter. At apple-picking time, Marmee celebrates her 60th birthday at Plumfield, with her husband, her three surviving daughters, their husbands, and her five grandchildren.\n\n==Characters==\n===Margaret \"Meg\" March===\nMeg, the eldest sister, is 16 when the story starts. She is referred to as a beauty and manages the household when her mother is absent. She is long brown-haired and blue-eyed and has particularly beautiful hands.

Finally, the family accepts that Beth will not live much longer. They make a special room for her, filled with all the things she loves best: her kittens, her piano, Father's books, Amy's sketches, and her beloved dolls.

Critic Martha Saxton observes the author was never fully at ease with Amy's moral development and her success in life seemed relatively accidental.<ref name=Saxton/> However, Amy's morality does appear to develop throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, and she is able to confidently and justly put Laurie in his place when she believes he is wasting his life on pleasurable activities. Ultimately, Amy is shown to work very hard to gain what she wants in life, and to make the most of her success while she has it.\n\nDue to her early selfishness (when her friends knew she would not share any pickled lime) and attachment to material things, Amy has been described as the least likable of the four sisters, but she is also the only one who strives to excel at art purely for self-expression, in contrast to Jo, who sometimes writes for financial gain.<ref name=\"Hollander\">{{cite book |last=Hollander |first=Anne |title=Feeding the Eye |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hp2T9MX15IkC&pg=PA233#v=onepage&q=Little%20women%20minor%20characters |year=2000 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0520226593 |page=233}}</ref>\n\n===Additional characters===\n[[File:The March Sisters.png|thumb|''The March Sisters'' by [[Pablo Marcos]]]]\n*Margaret \"Marmee\" March \u2013 The girls' mother and head of household while her husband is away.

Laurie is the \"boy next door\" to the March family and has an overprotective paternal grandfather, Mr. Laurence. After eloping with an Italian pianist, Laurie's father was disowned by his parents. Both  Laurie's mother and father died young, so as a boy Laurie was taken in by his grandfather. Preparing to enter Harvard, Laurie is being tutored by John Brooke. He is described as attractive and charming, with black eyes, brown skin, and curly black hair. He later falls in love with Amy and they marry; they have one child, a little girl named after Beth: Elizabeth \"Bess\" Laurence. Sometimes Jo calls Laurie \"Teddy\".

Somewhat temperamental and prone to being judgmental, she disapproves of the family's poverty, their charitable work, and their general disregard for the more superficial aspects of society's ways.

Alcott quickly completed a second volume (titled '''''Good Wives''''' in the United Kingdom, although this name originated from the publisher and not from Alcott), and it was also successful. The two volumes were issued in 1880 as a single novel titled ''Little Women.''\n\nAlcott wrote two sequels to her popular work, both of which also featured the March sisters: ''[[Little Men]]'' (1871) and ''[[Jo's Boys]]'' (1886). The novel addresses three major themes: \"domesticity, work, and true love, all of them interdependent and each necessary to the achievement of its heroine's individual identity.\"<ref name=Elbert>{{cite book |author=Elbert, Sarah |title=A Hunger for Home: Louisa May Alcott's Place in American Culture |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick |year=1987 |isbn=0-8135-1199-2}}</ref>{{rp|200}} According to [[Sarah Elbert]], Alcott created a new form of literature, one that took elements from Romantic children's fiction and combined it with others from sentimental novels, resulting in a totally new format.

Having lost all his money, their father is acting as a [[pastor]] in the [[American Civil War]], far from home. The women face their first Christmas without him.\n\nMeg and Jo March, the elder two, have to work in order to support the family: Meg teaches a nearby family of four children;  Jo assists her aged [[great-aunt]] March, a wealthy widow living in a [[mansion]], Plumfield. Beth, too timid for school, is content to stay at home and help with housework; Amy is still at school. Meg is beautiful and traditional, Jo is a tomboy who writes; Beth is a peacemaker and a pianist; Amy is an artist who longs for elegance and fine society.\n\nJo is impulsive and quick to anger. One of her challenges is trying to control her anger, a challenge that her mother experiences. She advises Jo to speak with forethought before leaving to travel to [[Washington, DC|Washington]], where her husband has [[pneumonia]].\n\nTheir neighbor, Mr. Laurence, who is charmed by Beth, gives her a piano. Beth contracts [[scarlet fever]] after spending time with a poor family where three children die. Jo tends Beth in her illness. Beth recovers, but never fully. As a precaution, Amy is sent to live with Aunt March, replacing Jo, while Beth is ill and still infectious.\n\nJo has success in earning money with her writing. Meg spends two weeks with friends, where there are parties for the girls to dance with boys and improve their social skills. Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence, Mr. Laurence's grandson, is invited to one of the dances, as Meg's friends incorrectly think she is in love with him. Meg is more interested in John Brooke, Laurie's young tutor. Brooke goes to Washington to help Mr. March. While with the March parents, Brooke confesses his love for Meg. They are pleased but consider Meg too young to be married. Brooke agrees to wait.  He [[enlist]]s and serves a year or so in the war. After he is wounded, he returns to find work so he can buy a house ready for when he marries Meg. Laurie goes off to college. On Christmas Day, a year after the book's opening, the girls' father returns from the war.\n\n===Part Two===\n(Published separately in the United Kingdom as ''Good Wives'')\n\nThree years later, Meg and John marry and learn how to live together. When they have twins, Meg is a devoted mother but John begins to feel left out. Laurie graduates from college, having put in the effort to do well in his last year with Jo's prompting. Amy goes on a European tour with her aunt. Beth's health is weak and her spirits are down. When trying to uncover the reason for Beth's sadness, Jo realizes that Laurie has fallen in love. At first she believes it's with Beth but soon senses it's with herself. Jo confides in Marmee, telling her that she loves Laurie but she loves him like a brother and that she could not love him in a romantic way.\n\nJo decides she wants a bit of adventure and to put distance between herself and Laurie, hoping he will forget his feelings. She spends six months with a friend of her mother in New York City, serving as [[governess]] for her two children. The family runs a boarding house. She takes German lessons with Professor Bhaer, who lives in the house. He has come to America from Berlin to care for the orphaned sons of his sister. For extra money, Jo writes stories without a moral, which disappoints Bhaer. He persuades her to give up poorly written sensational stories as her time in New York comes to an end. When she returns, Laurie proposes marriage and she declines.\n\nLaurie travels to Europe with his grandfather to escape his heartbreak. At home, Beth's health has seriously deteriorated. Jo devotes her time to the care of her dying sister. Laurie encounters Amy in Europe, and he slowly falls in love with her as he begins to see her in a new light. She is unimpressed by the aimless, idle and forlorn attitude he has adopted since being rejected by Jo, and inspires him to find his purpose and do something worthwhile with his life. With the news of Beth's death, they meet for consolation and their romance grows. Amy's aunt will not allow Amy to return with just Laurie and his grandfather, so they marry before returning home from Europe.\n\nProfessor Bhaer goes to the Marches' and stays for two weeks. On his last day, he proposes to Jo. Jo accepts. When Aunt March dies, she leaves Plumfield to Jo. Jo and Bhaer turn the house into a school for boys. They have two sons of their own, and Amy and Laurie have a daughter. At apple-picking time, Marmee celebrates her 60th birthday at Plumfield, with her husband, her three surviving daughters, their husbands, and her five grandchildren.\n\n==Characters==\n===Margaret \"Meg\" March===\nMeg, the eldest sister, is 16 when the story starts.

Finally, the family accepts that Beth will not live much longer. They make a special room for her, filled with all the things she loves best: her kittens, her piano, Father's books, Amy's sketches, and her beloved dolls.

But eventually she puts down her sewing needle, saying it grew \"heavy.\" Beth's final sickness has a strong effect on her sisters, especially Jo, who resolves to live her life with more consideration and care for everyone.

Ultimately, Amy is shown to work very hard to gain what she wants in life, and to make the most of her success while she has it.\n\nDue to her early selfishness (when her friends knew she would not share any pickled lime) and attachment to material things, Amy has been described as the least likable of the four sisters, but she is also the only one who strives to excel at art purely for self-expression, in contrast to Jo, who sometimes writes for financial gain.<ref name=\"Hollander\">{{cite book |last=Hollander |first=Anne |title=Feeding the Eye |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hp2T9MX15IkC&pg=PA233#v=onepage&q=Little%20women%20minor%20characters |year=2000 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0520226593 |page=233}}</ref>\n\n===Additional characters===\n[[File:The March Sisters.png|thumb|''The March Sisters'' by [[Pablo Marcos]]]]\n*Margaret \"Marmee\" March \u2013 The girls' mother and head of household while her husband is away.

Somewhat temperamental and prone to being judgmental, she disapproves of the family's poverty, their charitable work, and their general disregard for the more superficial aspects of society's ways.

According to 21st-century critic Barbara Sicherman there was, during the 19th century, a \"scarcity of models for nontraditional womanhood\", which led more women to look toward \"literature for self-authorization. This is especially true during adolescence.\"<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|2}} ''Little Women'' became \"the paradigmatic text for young women of the era and one in which family literary culture is prominently featured.\"<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|3}} Adult elements of women's fiction in ''Little Women'' included \"a change of heart necessary\" for the female protagonist to evolve in the story.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|199}}\n\nIn the late 20th century some scholars criticized the novel. Sarah Elbert, for instance, wrote that ''Little Women'' was the beginning of \"a decline in the radical power of women's fiction\", partly because women's fiction was being idealized with a \"hearth and home\" children's story.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|197}} Women's literature historians and juvenile fiction historians have agreed that ''Little Women'' was the beginning of this \"downward spiral\". But Elbert says that ''Little Women'' did not \"belittle women's fiction\" and that Alcott stayed true to her \"Romantic birthright\".<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\n''Little Women'''s popular audience was responsive to ideas of social change as they were shown \"within the familiar construct of domesticity\".<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|220}} While Alcott had been commissioned to \"write a story for girls\", her primary heroine, Jo March, became a favorite of many different women, including educated women writers through the 20th century. The girl story became a \"new publishing category with a domestic focus that paralleled boys' adventure stories\".<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|3\u20134}}\n\nOne reason the novel was so popular was that it appealed to different classes of women along with those of different national backgrounds, at a time of high immigration to the United States.

After the publication of the first volume, many girls wrote to Alcott asking her \"who the little women marry\".<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|21}} The unresolved ending added to the popularity of ''Little Women''. Sicherman said that the unsatisfying ending worked to \"keep the story alive\" as if the reader might find it ended differently upon different readings.<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|21}} \"Alcott particularly battled the conventional marriage plot in writing ''Little Women''.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Boyd, Anne E.|title=Writing for Immortality: Women Writers and the Emergence of High Literary Culture in America|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|year=2004|page=72|isbn=0-8018-7875-6}}</ref> Alcott did not have Jo accept Laurie's hand in marriage; rather, when she arranged for Jo to marry, she portrayed an unconventional man as her husband.
