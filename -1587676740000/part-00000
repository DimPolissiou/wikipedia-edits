Eventually he takes control of the government, solves the problems of the nation, from unemployment to racketeering, and arranges for worldwide peace, before dying of a heart attack. The movie received the financial backing and creative input of [[William Randolph Hearst]]. It was directed by [[Gregory La Cava]], produced by [[Walter Wanger]]<ref name=\"Clute and Grant, 3802\">Clute and Grant, 380</ref> and written by [[Carey Wilson (writer)|Carey Wilson]] based upon the novel ''Rinehard: A Melodrama of the Nineteen-Thirties'' (1933) by [[Thomas Frederic Tweed]]. Tweed did not receive screen credit (the film's opening credits say \"based on the anonymous novel, ''Gabriel Over the White House''{{-\"}}) but he was credited in the copyright information. The supporting cast features [[Karen Morley]], [[Franchot Tone]], [[C. Henry Gordon]], and [[David Landau (actor)|David Landau]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens with the swearing in of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Judson C. 'Judd' Hammond ([[Walter Huston]]). Hammond's young nephew Jimmie Vetter ([[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]]) interrupts the reception, and Hammond laughingly presents the boy as \u201cthe only person who can see the President at any time without an appointment.\u201d Jim wants to be a gangster when he grows up. The cheerful conversation among Hammond and the other men as they leave the reception highlights the favors owed, the promises made to be kept and made to be forgotten, and the corruption that has brought him to office. The last comment from a departing official: \u201cYou\u2019ll make the best President the Party ever had!\u201d\n\nHarley Beekman ([[Franchot Tone]]) is the youngest presidential secretary in history, but Hammond puts him at his ease, telling him that he prefers to be called Major instead of Mr. President and christening Beekman \u201cBeek\u201d. A Miss Pendola Molloy ([[Karen Morley]])\u2014a charming and beautiful young woman\u2014arrives after everyone else has gone and gives Beekman her card, asking to see the President. In the office, Hammond is laughing with his valet Sylvester ([[Fred Toones]]) at all the kings congratulating him on his inauguration. When Beek gives him Miss Molloy's card, Hammond tells him that there are actually two people who can be admitted to his presence at any time; Miss Molloy is the other one.\n\nBeekman brings Molloy in, telling her that this is his first official duty\u2014escorting her to the President's office. Once there, Hammond introduces her to Beek\u2014as Beek's new assistant. The easy-going banter makes it clear that she is the President's mistress. She tells Beek to call her Pendie and bids him a pointed \u201cgood night.\u201d\n\nAt his first press briefing.  Beek announces that in future questions must be submitted 24 hours in advance, but today the president will take questions. A reporter asks if the President will meet with John Bronson ([[David Landau (actor)|David Landau]]), and Beek realizes that Hammond doesn't know who that is. Covering for him quickly, he says that the President didn't hear the question and prompts Hammond with the information he needs\u2014that Bronson is the leader of a march on Washington of a million unemployed men wanting work. Hammond delivers one glib reply after another. Bronson is a dangerous anarchist who will be arrested if he comes near the White House; unemployment is a local problem; racketeering is a local problem; the American people need to learn how to live with Prohibition. A young reporter named Thieson ([[Mischa Auer]]) recounts a litany of horrors exposed by his paper: millions poured into new battleships while farmers burn corn and wheat; food thrown into the sea while people beg for bread; millions of homeless, thousands of empty homes; men freezing without coats; cotton rotting in the field; 5,000 gangland murders, only five men in jail (and that for tax evasion). What does the government say to this collapse of the American democracy? The President replies with a large dose of rhetoric and the statement \u201cOur party promises a return to prosperity!\u201d May the president be quoted, they ask? No, the president may not be quoted. Thiesen stands alone, stricken.\n\nIn the office, Hammond is combining business and favors as usual. Pendie gives him documents to sign; the Springfield Memorial Society has sent him a gift, the quill pen and inkwell that Lincoln used to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. Hammond is not impressed, and laughs at the fact that he is using it to sign a bill for sewers in Puerto Rico.  When Pendie points out that Hammond could really do something with that pen, he tells her she's an idealist. \u201cThe Party has a plan, and I\u2019m just a member of the Party.\u201d Jimmie bursts in, and Hammond is more interested in him than in Pendie. While Bronson speaks eloquently on the radio, saying that \u201cthe right man in the White House can bring us out of despair and into prosperity again,\u201d Hammond plays treasure hunt with his nephew, oblivious to what is going on. After Hammond leaves for Annapolis, Jimmie goes to the box of marshmallows in the desk and stuffs himself with candy.\n\nThe President insists on driving to Annapolis himself, racing the motorcycle escort at speeds exceeding 98&nbsp;mph. A tire blows and the President's car goes off the road.\n\nAt the White House, Dr. Eastman ([[Samuel S. Hinds|Samuel Hinds]]) has called in two other doctors, who agree that Hammond is \u201cbeyond any human help.\u201d Hammond lies in an ornate wooden bed, his face in shadow.  Sylvester and the nurse are nearby. A high faint two-note call sounds, then a harp strums. A breeze ruffles the lace curtains, and the bed is flooded with white light, while horns play, fuller and richer. The light returns to normal and Hammond reaches out to the bell-pull. When Eastman comes to the bedside, Hammond says \u201cThe doctors are wrong: Judd Hammond isn\u2019t going to die.\u201d\n\nThe press are going crazy for want of news. It has been weeks, and Dr. Eastman says only that the President is still in a coma. They beg Beekman to lie if he has to, just give them something. He refuses. Only Eastman and Sylvester have seen Hammond. The reporters leave, and Eastman confides in Beekman and Molloy, who is desperate. The president has been perfectly well for two weeks, but he is not the Judd Hammond whom Eastman has known for 15 years. He says nothing but sits silently reading and thinking, \u201clike a gaunt gray ghost with burning eyes that seem to see right down into you.\u201d\n\nWhen Molloy approaches Hammond with affection, he just stares until she removes her hand from his arm and coolly gives her an assignment \u2014 get the facts about Bronson \u2014 and tells her to go. She tells Beek that his eyes are so strange, his voice is different, and he called her Miss Molloy. \u201cYou poor kid,\u201d Beek says, moving to comfort her.\n\nThe President tells Beekman to summon the cabinet to a meeting in one hour. Before Hammond comes in, they all agree that whatever happens, the Party must come first. They offer him condolences which he dismisses, telling them to save their condolences for the American people. They want him to use the military to deal with the marchers.  He refuses to call out the Army against American citizens, and when the Secretary of State threatens to resign, the President instantly accepts. \u201cI suggest you read the Constitution of the United States. You\u2019ll find the President has some power,\u201d he warns them. Later, surrounded by press members who ask what happened, Hammond tells them the truth \u2014 and says that they can quote him.\n\nRacketeer Nick Diamond ([[C. Henry Gordon]]) has Bronson picked up and brought to his lavish headquarters. Diamond observes that the government, like the American people, are \u201cjust a bunch of boobs.\u201d He sees a profitable partnership in store, but Bronson won't be bribed, and when he sees Diamond drawing a small black circle on a piece of paper, he adds that Diamond can't put a million men [https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/put+on+the+spot on the spot].\n\nThe marchers continue, singing [[John Brown's Body]]. Machine gun fire from an ambulance wounds Bronson fatally. He tells them to carry on, and they keep walking.\n\nThe march is nearing Baltimore. The President summons the Secretary of War and tells him that the marchers are to be fed and given shelter and their medical needs met. He also asks Beekman to make arrangements for him to go to Baltimore.\n\nBeek and Pendie are in awe of Hammond. Pendie recalls a conversation [off camera], when Beek told Pendie that \u201ca simple honest man could solve everything.\u201d Beek replies that \u201cThe way he thinks is so simple and honest that it sounds a little crazy.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s doing the things you wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd If he\u2019s mad, it\u2019s a divine madness. Look at the chaos and catastrophe sane men have brought about.\u201d\n\nThe President goes to Baltimore and walks alone into the rally, where he meets Alice Bronson ([[Jean Parker]]) and pays tribute to her father, a martyr who died trying \u201cto arouse the stupid, lazy people of the United States to force their government to do something before everybody slowly starves to death.\u201d A chant rises, \u201cWe want work.\u201d Hammond promises to create an Army of Construction, and the men sing [[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]].\n\nThat night, the President is at his desk and Molloy gives him a sheaf of papers. He is bewildered and doesn't recognize his own words. When she replies that it is his address to Congress, he replies \"I never saw it\", and pauses.  Harps and brass instruments play, The familiar repeated two-note call is followed by more \u2014 and a white light blooms outside the window, stirring the curtains, and then disappears.  Hammond looks up and turns his head from side to side, as if listening, and then straightens up confidently, saying \u201cAh yes, my address to Congress.\u201d\n\nA shaken Pendie tells Beek what has happened. \u201cThere was something in the room that made me shiver.\u201d She reminds Beek that from the time of the accident they both felt that the President was really two men [something not discussed on camera until now] but she just became aware of a third being. She asks, \u201cWhat if God sent the [[Gabriel|Angel Gabriel]] to do for Judd Hammond what he did for [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]?\u201d Beek says he thought that Gabriel was a messenger of wrath, and she replies that to some he was a messenger of revelations. \u201cHmmmm,\u201d Beek muses, \u201cGabriel over the White House.\u201d The soundtrack has the marchers singing \u201cThe Battle Hymn of the Republic\u201d In his office, Hammond looks out the window into the dark, to the empty sidewalk along Pennsylvania Avenue. A dense crowd of people materializes, and then fades away. Hammond says nothing, but turns out the light and leaves. The camera zooms in on the alabaster bust of Abraham Lincoln and fades out. [The film never makes it clear whether this is Hammond imagining the marchers coming to Washington or is a premonition of the mourners standing outside the White House after his death.]\n\nThe Cabinet is holding a secret meeting.  Beek comes in with a stack of envelopes and hands them out. They are bewildered. \u201cHow did Hammond know we were here?\u201d one asks. The envelopes contain notes from the President: They are all fired. Infuriated, they plan to go to Congress.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, a majority of both houses of Congress are planning to impeach and remove the President. He enters the chamber and asks that the rules [of order] be suspended while he answers questions. He asks them to declare a state of national emergency and adjourn so he can take power. He counters accusations of dictatorship with the statement that if he is a dictator it is a dictatorship based on Jefferson's idea of democracy: the greatest good for the greatest number. Facing the threat of martial law, Congress gives him what he wants.\n\nSome time later, Hammond addresses the American people by radio to tell more of his plans. The Army of Construction is working. Next he will stop foreclosures, enact a National Banking Law, direct aid specifically to the 55 million people who work in agriculture, and attack racketeering. Prohibition has been repealed but that is just a start. Diamond and his cronies are listening and laughing: Diamond thinks ratification by the states will take three years.\n\nDiamond comes to the White House and is shown into the President's office. He looks around and pauses near the bust of Lincoln. It makes him uncomfortable and he sits down. The President comes in holding a thick dossier: Diamond's biography. Hammond observes that Diamond has already helped the government tremendously by eliminating his competition; that the best way to solve the current situation would be for Diamond to go back to his native country. Diamond, however, sees no reason to give up. The President warns that the government is about to \u201cmuscle in on his racket.\u201d\n\nThe first U.S. Government Liquor Store is bombed, and machine-gun fire rakes the White House, gravely wounding Pendie just as she and Beekman are about to confess their love to each other. In the hospital, they do. The President comes in as they kiss. He gives Beekman a new job, head of the Federal Police, a mobile unit of the Army. It will be temporary, to eliminate gangsters. He also suggests a wedding at the White House. All the racketeers are taken care of except for Diamond. Beek shows up in uniform at Diamond's stronghold, with ultramodern assault vehicles that devastate the fortress. Under arrest, Diamond is confident that his lawyer will get him \u201chabeus corpused right out of there,\u201d but Beek points out that this will be a military trial. He presides and Diamond and his men are executed by firing squad.\n\nHammond next deals with the problem of the war debts owed to the United States by assembling representatives of the debtor nations on board a yacht wired for broadcast to the world. He demonstrates America's \u201cnew Navy,\u201d a Navy of the Air. The country had been spending billions of dollars on antiquated armament. From now on, he declares, battleships are useless. Aircraft [biplanes] in the United States Navy of the Air destroy an empty battleship in a demonstration. Disarmament will make it possible for the world to re-purpose the billions wasted on weaponry that has become obsolete. He addresses the people of the world: \u201cThe next war will be a terrible story... the next war will depopulate the Earth..invisible poison gases, inconceivably devastating explosives, annihilating death rays will sweep to utter destruction not only the men, but the children who would constitute another generation and the mothers who bear them. Armies and Navies will be destroyed from the air, ....Shall we save this world, restore it to a condition where it can truly be said that there is Peace on Earth, Good Will Toward Men...?\u201d\n\nThe Washington Covenant is being signed. The President is announced, and to a brief flourish and a chorus of the [[Battle Hymn of the Republic|Battle Hymn]] he walks slowly to the table. An aide hands him the official pen, but he uses the Lincoln quill (which, judging by her smile, was placed there by Pendie). He signs slowly, collapses and is carried into his private quarters. Everyone leaves but Eastman, Beekman, Sylvester, and Molloy. Eastman says that it is his heart, and Beekman goes to allay the world's fears.\n\nMolloy kneels beside the couch and smooths his hair. The light on Hammond's face changes [through time-lapse photography or double exposure], first intensifying the hollows in his eyes and cheekbones and around his mouth \u2014 evoking an image of Lincoln \u2014 and then brightening until all the shadows disappear. Molloy is wide-eyed as he turns toward her and says \u201cHello Pendie old girl.\u201d The doctor offers him medicine.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do for me, Eastman,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cDoes the President of the United States meet with your approval?\u201d he asks Molloy, feebly. \u201cHe\u2019s proved himself one of the greatest men who ever lived,\u201d she replies. \u201cHold my hand, Pendie.\u201d She takes it. The two-note call on a horn and strum on the harp strings is repeated, the curtains stir [the window is not open], then the music grows more complex. Pendie feels him go and looks around toward the window, where the curtains stir again. The horn motif continues and turns into the Battle Hymn, at a slow, marching pace.  Beekman and Pendie come out to the assembled dignitaries arm in arm. She is looking at something high up and above their heads. Beekman brings the President's thanks and then announces that the President is dead. Outside, throngs waiting along the fence watch as the flag on the White House roof is lowered to [[Half-mast|half-staff]], to the last notes of [[Taps]].\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Walter Huston]] as President Judson Hammond\n* [[Karen Morley]] as Pendola \u201cPendie\u201d Molloy\n* [[Franchot Tone]] as Hartley \u201cBeek\u201d Beekman - Secretary to the President\n* [[Arthur Byron]] as Jasper Brooks - Secretary of State\n* [[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]] as Jimmy Vetter\n* [[C.

Mayer did not see the script before filming (however, this is contradicted in the biography of producer [[Walter Wanger]]) and, as a staunch Republican and supporter of Herbert Hoover he held the film back until after the inauguration of President Roosevelt on March 4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1553/Gabriel-over-the-White-House/notes.html|title=Gabriel over the White House (1933) - Notes - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2013 article in the New Yorker, Richard Brody wrote that \u201cThe story is extraordinary\u2014and so is the story of its production, as told in Matthew Bernstein\u2019s biography of its producer, Walter Wanger, who gave the project its impetus. Hammond is a wild man with a purpose\u2014and the new U.S. President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, loved it. As Bernstein tells it, this was no surprise; the movie was conceived as a Rooseveltian vehicle from the start. Wanger bought the novel on which it was based\u2014a British futuristic fantasy by Thomas W. Tweed\u2014in January, 1933, two months before the inauguration (which, until that year, took place on March 4; the Twentieth Amendment, which passed the same month, moved it to January 20). Wanger rushed the movie into production (Hearst himself wrote some of Hammond\u2019s most flamboyant flights of political rhetoric) and rushed it into production (they shot for two weeks in February) so that it could be released soon after the inauguration.\u201d<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-hollywood-movie-made-for-f-d-r-s-inauguration|title=The Hollywood Movie Made for F.D.R.\u2019s Inauguration|date=2013-01-21|access-date=2019-10-20|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>\n\n\u201cWanger was working under the aegis of the production company owned by William Randolph Hearst, an ardent Roosevelt supporter (and who had much to do with Roosevelt securing the Democratic nomination) whose films were distributed by M-G-M, the boss of which, Louis B. Mayer, was a rock-ribbed Republican. Though Mayer was appalled, he didn\u2019t block its release (on March 31). In a piquant detail, Bernstein reports, \u201cWhen Wanger, a staunch Roosevelt supporter, approached [the producer Irving] Thalberg about his differences with Mayer over politics and production ideas, Thalberg had told Wanger, \u2018Don\u2019t pay any attention to him.\u2019\u201d (Thalberg was the ill-fated \u201cboy wonder\u201d producer who ran the studio along with Mayer, and whom F. Scott Fitzgerald transformed into the title character of \u201cThe Last Tycoon.\u201d) Rather, Wanger faced an even higher authority\u2014the censorious Hays Code office, which required some changes, even some reshoots that blunted some of the sharpest political satire.\u201d<ref name=\"newyorker.com\"/>\n\nRichard Brody, writing for The New Yorker in 2013, says that \u201cOne of the reasons for the movie\u2019s impact is its direction, by Gregory La Cava, who is one of the most distinctive of Hollywood talents of the nineteen-thirties and early forties... He\u2019s essentially a comic director, but one whose sense of humor is laced with dark and poignant melodrama. His joltingly mixed moods have a novelistic sensibility, with a fluid and astute visual vulnerability to match. I\u2019ve written here about his 1941 comic drama \u201cUnfinished Business,\u201d perhaps his masterwork (followed closely by \u201cMy Man Godfrey\u201d and \u201cStage Door\u201d) and compared it to a novel by Dawn Powell. In \u201cGabriel,\u201d Hammond comes off not as a stuffy and out-of-touch grandee such as Hoover, but as a free-swinging, superannuated vestige of the Jazz Age, a character from Fitzgerald in the era of Steinbeck. La Cava's direction of Huston is kaleidoscopically dazzling; together, they turn the abstractions of straw-figure advocacy into an emotionally intricate and ever-surprising character. Hammond's quasi-divine possession comes off as a sort of distanced madness, a fury that grips him not at all blindly; he calmly and unapologetically observes himself rising\u2014or going deeper\u2014into world-historical grandeur. In the presence of radio microphones and world leaders, Hammond delivers a wild speech (dictated by Hearst), that, in its utopian and histrionic extremes, foreshadows the climactic oration by Charlie Chaplin in \u201cThe Great Dictator\u201d even as the specifics of the principled power-grab at the core of the film seem downright fascistic.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAlthough an internal [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] synopsis had labeled the script \"wildly [[reactionary]] and [[Political radicalism|radical]] to the nth degree,\" studio boss [[Louis B. Mayer]] \"learned only when he attended the [[Glendale, California]] preview that Hammond gradually turns America into a [[dictatorship]]\" writes [https://m.imdb.com/name/nm1008804/bio?ref_=m_mn_ov_bio film historian Barbara Hall].  Bernstein contradicts this statement saying that Mayer was kept posted all along, particularly through communications from the censor.  According to Bernstein's biography of Wanger, however, \"Mayer was furious, telling his lieutenant, 'Put that picture back in its can, take it back to the studio, and lock it up!'\"\n\n==Historical Context==\n\nThings worth remembering when watching this picture in 2019:\n\nThe [[Great Depression]]  was at its peak when the film was made. [[Herbert Hoover]] had lost the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 Presidential election]] to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], who would take office on March 4, 1933. Reforms lay in the future.\n\n'''Reporters access to the President'''\n\nRoosevelt gave access and received secrecy in exchange.\n\n'''Banking'''\n\nMany things that we take for granted, such as the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]], were only ideas. In a time when bank failures were common, Congress failed to pass more than 150 bills that would have provided some kind of deposit insurance. More than 1/3 of the banks in the United States had failed during the Depression, many because of \u201cruns\u201d created by panicking depositors. The [[1933 Banking Act]] was passed with overwhelming support from the public and became law on June 16, 1933. Although it was eventually considered part of the [[New Deal]], President Roosevelt was skeptical about its affects.\n\n'''Totalitarianism and Dictatorships'''\n\n[[Benito Mussolini]] had been established as the President of Italy since his [[Fascism|fascisti]]  took power and gave birth to Fascism. [[Joseph Stalin]] ruled supreme over the [[Soviet Union]], which was enduring the peak of a horrible famine. [[Adolf Hitler]] was named Chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, two months prior to the films opening. On March 23, 1933, the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] gave him power to enact laws without the Reichstag's approval.\n\nHowever, Roosevelt's Presidency in the US did not join the above list. Roosevelt managed to implement his New Deal policies without resorting to the methods used by the film'm fictional President.\n\n'''Food'''\n\nCrops were rotting in the fields. The phenomena summed up in the name [[Dust Bowl]] had not begun. Any idea of the United States having extra crops would soon vanish, and the needs of agricultural workers and farmers would become even greater. The first storm would come in November 1933.\n\n'''Marches'''\n\nTwo marches on Washington may have inspired the one in the film. In January 1932,   [[Cox's Army]], a march of 25,000 unemployed Pennsylvanians led by Father [[James Renshaw Cox]], a Roman Catholic priest, gathered to encourage Congress to start a public works program. In mid-1932 the so-called [[Bonus Army]] consisting of 20,000 [[World War I]] veterans and their families descended on Washington seeking advance payment of bonuses owed to veterans from the [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] administration; several people were killed when troops were ordered to disperse the protesters on June 28. Midwesterners would remember the [[Ford Hunger March]] in Michigan, on March 7, 1932,\n\n'''War'''\n\nOne front of what would be the Second World War had recently opened when [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|the Japanese invaded Manchuria]] on September 18, 1931, beginning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino Japanese War]]. Japan, whose representatives are seen signing the covenant in the film, had for years laid plans to extend its empire through what would become [[World War II]]. The naval actions of WWII, such as the [[Battle of Midway]], proved that indeed the advent of air power has made the traditional battleships obsolete, as predicted in the film. Though terribly devastating, the actual WWII was short of the total apocalypse predicted by the President in the film; similar predictions continue to be made with regard to a potential [[Third World War]].\n\n'''Racketeering and crime'''\n\nCrime was rampant in the Great Depression. An article on history.com, [https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/crime-in-the-great-depression Crime in the Depression], updated in August 2018, describes the conditions that led to Roosevelt's anti-crime legislation.\n\nThe term [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]]  was coined by the [[Employers' Association of Greater Chicago|Employers' Association of Chicago]] in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of [[organized crime]] in the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] union.\n\nNotorious gangster [[Al Capone]] finally went to prison in May 1932 \u2014 for tax evasion.\n\nIn addition to news headlines, popular culture was obsessed with crime and punishment, and moviegoers were flocking to films like [[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]] (1931) and [[The Public Enemy]] (1931) and devouring stories like [[I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!|I am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang]] (January 1932) which would be adapted into a film later that year.\n\nThe [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] would not be known under that name until it became an independent service within the Department of Justice, in 1935.\n\n'''Prohibition'''\n\nThe fictional President Hammond describes [[Prohibition]] as a \u201ccesspool\u201d, and most of the audience would have agreed with him. In 1932, the platform of Democratic presidential candidate [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] included a plank for repealing the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]], and his victory that November marked a certain end to Prohibition. Congress did not wait. The [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] was proposed February 20, 1933, before this film was released.\n\n==Criticism==\nVariety reviewed the film on Dec. 31, 1932. It described the film as \u201cA mess of political tripe superlatively hoked up into a picture of strong popular possibilities...a cleverly executed commercial release...

It is concerned with a fictitious President of the United States named Judson Hammond ...who in the first sequences is portrayed as a careless partisan politician, becomes an earnest and conscientious President, who tackles the problems of unemployment, crime and the foreign debts something after the fashion of a Lincoln.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/04/01/archives/walter-huston-as-a-president-of-the-united-states-who-proclaims.html|title=Walter Huston as a President of the United States Who Proclaims Himself a Dictator.|last=Hall|first=Mordaunt|date=1933-04-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe film was labeled by ''[[The New Republic]]'' as \"a half-hearted plea for [[Fascism]]\".<ref>Ron Briley, \"The Sun Comes Out Tomorrow,\" in {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntLYUISCZUYC|title=Franklin D.

Eventually he takes control of the government, solves the problems of the nation, from unemployment to racketeering, and arranges for worldwide peace, before dying of a heart attack.

It was directed by [[Gregory La Cava]], produced by [[Walter Wanger]]<ref name=\"Clute and Grant, 3802\">Clute and Grant, 380</ref> and written by [[Carey Wilson (writer)|Carey Wilson]] based upon the novel ''Rinehard: A Melodrama of the Nineteen-Thirties'' (1933) by [[Thomas Frederic Tweed]]. Tweed did not receive screen credit (the film's opening credits say \"based on the anonymous novel, ''Gabriel Over the White House''{{-\"}}) but he was credited in the copyright information. The supporting cast features [[Karen Morley]], [[Franchot Tone]], [[C. Henry Gordon]], and [[David Landau (actor)|David Landau]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens with the swearing in of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Judson C. 'Judd' Hammond ([[Walter Huston]]). Hammond's young nephew Jimmie Vetter ([[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]]) interrupts the reception, and Hammond laughingly presents the boy as \u201cthe only person who can see the President at any time without an appointment.\u201d Jim wants to be a gangster when he grows up. The cheerful conversation among Hammond and the other men as they leave the reception highlights the favors owed, the promises made to be kept and made to be forgotten, and the corruption that has brought him to office. The last comment from a departing official: \u201cYou\u2019ll make the best President the Party ever had!\u201d\n\nHarley Beekman ([[Franchot Tone]]) is the youngest presidential secretary in history, but Hammond puts him at his ease, telling him that he prefers to be called Major instead of Mr. President and christening Beekman \u201cBeek\u201d. A Miss Pendola Molloy ([[Karen Morley]])\u2014a charming and beautiful young woman\u2014arrives after everyone else has gone and gives Beekman her card, asking to see the President. In the office, Hammond is laughing with his valet Sylvester ([[Fred Toones]]) at all the kings congratulating him on his inauguration. When Beek gives him Miss Molloy's card, Hammond tells him that there are actually two people who can be admitted to his presence at any time; Miss Molloy is the other one.\n\nBeekman brings Molloy in, telling her that this is his first official duty\u2014escorting her to the President's office. Once there, Hammond introduces her to Beek\u2014as Beek's new assistant. The easy-going banter makes it clear that she is the President's mistress. She tells Beek to call her Pendie and bids him a pointed \u201cgood night.\u201d\n\nAt his first press briefing.  Beek announces that in future questions must be submitted 24 hours in advance, but today the president will take questions. A reporter asks if the President will meet with John Bronson ([[David Landau (actor)|David Landau]]), and Beek realizes that Hammond doesn't know who that is. Covering for him quickly, he says that the President didn't hear the question and prompts Hammond with the information he needs\u2014that Bronson is the leader of a march on Washington of a million unemployed men wanting work. Hammond delivers one glib reply after another. Bronson is a dangerous anarchist who will be arrested if he comes near the White House; unemployment is a local problem; racketeering is a local problem; the American people need to learn how to live with Prohibition. A young reporter named Thieson ([[Mischa Auer]]) recounts a litany of horrors exposed by his paper: millions poured into new battleships while farmers burn corn and wheat; food thrown into the sea while people beg for bread; millions of homeless, thousands of empty homes; men freezing without coats; cotton rotting in the field; 5,000 gangland murders, only five men in jail (and that for tax evasion). What does the government say to this collapse of the American democracy? The President replies with a large dose of rhetoric and the statement \u201cOur party promises a return to prosperity!\u201d May the president be quoted, they ask? No, the president may not be quoted. Thiesen stands alone, stricken.\n\nIn the office, Hammond is combining business and favors as usual. Pendie gives him documents to sign; the Springfield Memorial Society has sent him a gift, the quill pen and inkwell that Lincoln used to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. Hammond is not impressed, and laughs at the fact that he is using it to sign a bill for sewers in Puerto Rico.  When Pendie points out that Hammond could really do something with that pen, he tells her she's an idealist. \u201cThe Party has a plan, and I\u2019m just a member of the Party.\u201d Jimmie bursts in, and Hammond is more interested in him than in Pendie. While Bronson speaks eloquently on the radio, saying that \u201cthe right man in the White House can bring us out of despair and into prosperity again,\u201d Hammond plays treasure hunt with his nephew, oblivious to what is going on. After Hammond leaves for Annapolis, Jimmie goes to the box of marshmallows in the desk and stuffs himself with candy.\n\nThe President insists on driving to Annapolis himself, racing the motorcycle escort at speeds exceeding 98&nbsp;mph. A tire blows and the President's car goes off the road.\n\nAt the White House, Dr. Eastman ([[Samuel S. Hinds|Samuel Hinds]]) has called in two other doctors, who agree that Hammond is \u201cbeyond any human help.\u201d Hammond lies in an ornate wooden bed, his face in shadow.  Sylvester and the nurse are nearby. A high faint two-note call sounds, then a harp strums. A breeze ruffles the lace curtains, and the bed is flooded with white light, while horns play, fuller and richer. The light returns to normal and Hammond reaches out to the bell-pull. When Eastman comes to the bedside, Hammond says \u201cThe doctors are wrong: Judd Hammond isn\u2019t going to die.\u201d\n\nThe press are going crazy for want of news. It has been weeks, and Dr. Eastman says only that the President is still in a coma. They beg Beekman to lie if he has to, just give them something. He refuses. Only Eastman and Sylvester have seen Hammond. The reporters leave, and Eastman confides in Beekman and Molloy, who is desperate. The president has been perfectly well for two weeks, but he is not the Judd Hammond whom Eastman has known for 15 years. He says nothing but sits silently reading and thinking, \u201clike a gaunt gray ghost with burning eyes that seem to see right down into you.\u201d\n\nWhen Molloy approaches Hammond with affection, he just stares until she removes her hand from his arm and coolly gives her an assignment \u2014 get the facts about Bronson \u2014 and tells her to go. She tells Beek that his eyes are so strange, his voice is different, and he called her Miss Molloy. \u201cYou poor kid,\u201d Beek says, moving to comfort her.\n\nThe President tells Beekman to summon the cabinet to a meeting in one hour. Before Hammond comes in, they all agree that whatever happens, the Party must come first. They offer him condolences which he dismisses, telling them to save their condolences for the American people. They want him to use the military to deal with the marchers.  He refuses to call out the Army against American citizens, and when the Secretary of State threatens to resign, the President instantly accepts. \u201cI suggest you read the Constitution of the United States. You\u2019ll find the President has some power,\u201d he warns them. Later, surrounded by press members who ask what happened, Hammond tells them the truth \u2014 and says that they can quote him.\n\nRacketeer Nick Diamond ([[C. Henry Gordon]]) has Bronson picked up and brought to his lavish headquarters. Diamond observes that the government, like the American people, are \u201cjust a bunch of boobs.\u201d He sees a profitable partnership in store, but Bronson won't be bribed, and when he sees Diamond drawing a small black circle on a piece of paper, he adds that Diamond can't put a million men [https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/put+on+the+spot on the spot].\n\nThe marchers continue, singing [[John Brown's Body]]. Machine gun fire from an ambulance wounds Bronson fatally. He tells them to carry on, and they keep walking.\n\nThe march is nearing Baltimore. The President summons the Secretary of War and tells him that the marchers are to be fed and given shelter and their medical needs met. He also asks Beekman to make arrangements for him to go to Baltimore.\n\nBeek and Pendie are in awe of Hammond. Pendie recalls a conversation [off camera], when Beek told Pendie that \u201ca simple honest man could solve everything.\u201d Beek replies that \u201cThe way he thinks is so simple and honest that it sounds a little crazy.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s doing the things you wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd If he\u2019s mad, it\u2019s a divine madness. Look at the chaos and catastrophe sane men have brought about.\u201d\n\nThe President goes to Baltimore and walks alone into the rally, where he meets Alice Bronson ([[Jean Parker]]) and pays tribute to her father, a martyr who died trying \u201cto arouse the stupid, lazy people of the United States to force their government to do something before everybody slowly starves to death.\u201d A chant rises, \u201cWe want work.\u201d Hammond promises to create an Army of Construction, and the men sing [[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]].\n\nThat night, the President is at his desk and Molloy gives him a sheaf of papers. He is bewildered and doesn't recognize his own words. When she replies that it is his address to Congress, he replies \"I never saw it\", and pauses.  Harps and brass instruments play, The familiar repeated two-note call is followed by more \u2014 and a white light blooms outside the window, stirring the curtains, and then disappears.  Hammond looks up and turns his head from side to side, as if listening, and then straightens up confidently, saying \u201cAh yes, my address to Congress.\u201d\n\nA shaken Pendie tells Beek what has happened. \u201cThere was something in the room that made me shiver.\u201d She reminds Beek that from the time of the accident they both felt that the President was really two men [something not discussed on camera until now] but she just became aware of a third being. She asks, \u201cWhat if God sent the [[Gabriel|Angel Gabriel]] to do for Judd Hammond what he did for [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]?\u201d Beek says he thought that Gabriel was a messenger of wrath, and she replies that to some he was a messenger of revelations. \u201cHmmmm,\u201d Beek muses, \u201cGabriel over the White House.\u201d The soundtrack has the marchers singing \u201cThe Battle Hymn of the Republic\u201d In his office, Hammond looks out the window into the dark, to the empty sidewalk along Pennsylvania Avenue. A dense crowd of people materializes, and then fades away. Hammond says nothing, but turns out the light and leaves. The camera zooms in on the alabaster bust of Abraham Lincoln and fades out. [The film never makes it clear whether this is Hammond imagining the marchers coming to Washington or is a premonition of the mourners standing outside the White House after his death.]\n\nThe Cabinet is holding a secret meeting.  Beek comes in with a stack of envelopes and hands them out. They are bewildered. \u201cHow did Hammond know we were here?\u201d one asks. The envelopes contain notes from the President: They are all fired. Infuriated, they plan to go to Congress.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, a majority of both houses of Congress are planning to impeach and remove the President. He enters the chamber and asks that the rules [of order] be suspended while he answers questions. He asks them to declare a state of national emergency and adjourn so he can take power. He counters accusations of dictatorship with the statement that if he is a dictator it is a dictatorship based on Jefferson's idea of democracy: the greatest good for the greatest number. Facing the threat of martial law, Congress gives him what he wants.\n\nSome time later, Hammond addresses the American people by radio to tell more of his plans. The Army of Construction is working. Next he will stop foreclosures, enact a National Banking Law, direct aid specifically to the 55 million people who work in agriculture, and attack racketeering. Prohibition has been repealed but that is just a start. Diamond and his cronies are listening and laughing: Diamond thinks ratification by the states will take three years.\n\nDiamond comes to the White House and is shown into the President's office. He looks around and pauses near the bust of Lincoln. It makes him uncomfortable and he sits down. The President comes in holding a thick dossier: Diamond's biography. Hammond observes that Diamond has already helped the government tremendously by eliminating his competition; that the best way to solve the current situation would be for Diamond to go back to his native country. Diamond, however, sees no reason to give up. The President warns that the government is about to \u201cmuscle in on his racket.\u201d\n\nThe first U.S. Government Liquor Store is bombed, and machine-gun fire rakes the White House, gravely wounding Pendie just as she and Beekman are about to confess their love to each other. In the hospital, they do. The President comes in as they kiss. He gives Beekman a new job, head of the Federal Police, a mobile unit of the Army. It will be temporary, to eliminate gangsters. He also suggests a wedding at the White House. All the racketeers are taken care of except for Diamond. Beek shows up in uniform at Diamond's stronghold, with ultramodern assault vehicles that devastate the fortress. Under arrest, Diamond is confident that his lawyer will get him \u201chabeus corpused right out of there,\u201d but Beek points out that this will be a military trial. He presides and Diamond and his men are executed by firing squad.\n\nHammond next deals with the problem of the war debts owed to the United States by assembling representatives of the debtor nations on board a yacht wired for broadcast to the world. He demonstrates America's \u201cnew Navy,\u201d a Navy of the Air. The country had been spending billions of dollars on antiquated armament. From now on, he declares, battleships are useless. Aircraft [biplanes] in the United States Navy of the Air destroy an empty battleship in a demonstration. Disarmament will make it possible for the world to re-purpose the billions wasted on weaponry that has become obsolete. He addresses the people of the world: \u201cThe next war will be a terrible story... the next war will depopulate the Earth..invisible poison gases, inconceivably devastating explosives, annihilating death rays will sweep to utter destruction not only the men, but the children who would constitute another generation and the mothers who bear them. Armies and Navies will be destroyed from the air, ....Shall we save this world, restore it to a condition where it can truly be said that there is Peace on Earth, Good Will Toward Men...?\u201d\n\nThe Washington Covenant is being signed. The President is announced, and to a brief flourish and a chorus of the [[Battle Hymn of the Republic|Battle Hymn]] he walks slowly to the table. An aide hands him the official pen, but he uses the Lincoln quill (which, judging by her smile, was placed there by Pendie). He signs slowly, collapses and is carried into his private quarters. Everyone leaves but Eastman, Beekman, Sylvester, and Molloy. Eastman says that it is his heart, and Beekman goes to allay the world's fears.\n\nMolloy kneels beside the couch and smooths his hair. The light on Hammond's face changes [through time-lapse photography or double exposure], first intensifying the hollows in his eyes and cheekbones and around his mouth \u2014 evoking an image of Lincoln \u2014 and then brightening until all the shadows disappear. Molloy is wide-eyed as he turns toward her and says \u201cHello Pendie old girl.\u201d The doctor offers him medicine.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do for me, Eastman,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cDoes the President of the United States meet with your approval?\u201d he asks Molloy, feebly. \u201cHe\u2019s proved himself one of the greatest men who ever lived,\u201d she replies. \u201cHold my hand, Pendie.\u201d She takes it. The two-note call on a horn and strum on the harp strings is repeated, the curtains stir [the window is not open], then the music grows more complex. Pendie feels him go and looks around toward the window, where the curtains stir again. The horn motif continues and turns into the Battle Hymn, at a slow, marching pace.  Beekman and Pendie come out to the assembled dignitaries arm in arm. She is looking at something high up and above their heads. Beekman brings the President's thanks and then announces that the President is dead. Outside, throngs waiting along the fence watch as the flag on the White House roof is lowered to [[Half-mast|half-staff]], to the last notes of [[Taps]].\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Walter Huston]] as President Judson Hammond\n* [[Karen Morley]] as Pendola \u201cPendie\u201d Molloy\n* [[Franchot Tone]] as Hartley \u201cBeek\u201d Beekman - Secretary to the President\n* [[Arthur Byron]] as Jasper Brooks - Secretary of State\n* [[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]] as Jimmy Vetter\n* [[C.

Mayer did not see the script before filming (however, this is contradicted in the biography of producer [[Walter Wanger]]) and, as a staunch Republican and supporter of Herbert Hoover he held the film back until after the inauguration of President Roosevelt on March 4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1553/Gabriel-over-the-White-House/notes.html|title=Gabriel over the White House (1933) - Notes - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2013 article in the New Yorker, Richard Brody wrote that \u201cThe story is extraordinary\u2014and so is the story of its production, as told in Matthew Bernstein\u2019s biography of its producer, Walter Wanger, who gave the project its impetus. Hammond is a wild man with a purpose\u2014and the new U.S. President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, loved it. As Bernstein tells it, this was no surprise; the movie was conceived as a Rooseveltian vehicle from the start. Wanger bought the novel on which it was based\u2014a British futuristic fantasy by Thomas W. Tweed\u2014in January, 1933, two months before the inauguration (which, until that year, took place on March 4; the Twentieth Amendment, which passed the same month, moved it to January 20). Wanger rushed the movie into production (Hearst himself wrote some of Hammond\u2019s most flamboyant flights of political rhetoric) and rushed it into production (they shot for two weeks in February) so that it could be released soon after the inauguration.\u201d<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-hollywood-movie-made-for-f-d-r-s-inauguration|title=The Hollywood Movie Made for F.D.R.\u2019s Inauguration|date=2013-01-21|access-date=2019-10-20|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>\n\n\u201cWanger was working under the aegis of the production company owned by William Randolph Hearst, an ardent Roosevelt supporter (and who had much to do with Roosevelt securing the Democratic nomination) whose films were distributed by M-G-M, the boss of which, Louis B. Mayer, was a rock-ribbed Republican. Though Mayer was appalled, he didn\u2019t block its release (on March 31). In a piquant detail, Bernstein reports, \u201cWhen Wanger, a staunch Roosevelt supporter, approached [the producer Irving] Thalberg about his differences with Mayer over politics and production ideas, Thalberg had told Wanger, \u2018Don\u2019t pay any attention to him.\u2019\u201d (Thalberg was the ill-fated \u201cboy wonder\u201d producer who ran the studio along with Mayer, and whom F. Scott Fitzgerald transformed into the title character of \u201cThe Last Tycoon.\u201d) Rather, Wanger faced an even higher authority\u2014the censorious Hays Code office, which required some changes, even some reshoots that blunted some of the sharpest political satire.\u201d<ref name=\"newyorker.com\"/>\n\nRichard Brody, writing for The New Yorker in 2013, says that \u201cOne of the reasons for the movie\u2019s impact is its direction, by Gregory La Cava, who is one of the most distinctive of Hollywood talents of the nineteen-thirties and early forties... He\u2019s essentially a comic director, but one whose sense of humor is laced with dark and poignant melodrama. His joltingly mixed moods have a novelistic sensibility, with a fluid and astute visual vulnerability to match. I\u2019ve written here about his 1941 comic drama \u201cUnfinished Business,\u201d perhaps his masterwork (followed closely by \u201cMy Man Godfrey\u201d and \u201cStage Door\u201d) and compared it to a novel by Dawn Powell. In \u201cGabriel,\u201d Hammond comes off not as a stuffy and out-of-touch grandee such as Hoover, but as a free-swinging, superannuated vestige of the Jazz Age, a character from Fitzgerald in the era of Steinbeck. La Cava's direction of Huston is kaleidoscopically dazzling; together, they turn the abstractions of straw-figure advocacy into an emotionally intricate and ever-surprising character. Hammond's quasi-divine possession comes off as a sort of distanced madness, a fury that grips him not at all blindly; he calmly and unapologetically observes himself rising\u2014or going deeper\u2014into world-historical grandeur. In the presence of radio microphones and world leaders, Hammond delivers a wild speech (dictated by Hearst), that, in its utopian and histrionic extremes, foreshadows the climactic oration by Charlie Chaplin in \u201cThe Great Dictator\u201d even as the specifics of the principled power-grab at the core of the film seem downright fascistic.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAlthough an internal [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] synopsis had labeled the script \"wildly [[reactionary]] and [[Political radicalism|radical]] to the nth degree,\" studio boss [[Louis B. Mayer]] \"learned only when he attended the [[Glendale, California]] preview that Hammond gradually turns America into a [[dictatorship]]\" writes [https://m.imdb.com/name/nm1008804/bio?ref_=m_mn_ov_bio film historian Barbara Hall].  Bernstein contradicts this statement saying that Mayer was kept posted all along, particularly through communications from the censor.  According to Bernstein's biography of Wanger, however, \"Mayer was furious, telling his lieutenant, 'Put that picture back in its can, take it back to the studio, and lock it up!'\"\n\n==Historical Context==\n\nThings worth remembering when watching this picture in 2019:\n\nThe [[Great Depression]]  was at its peak when the film was made. [[Herbert Hoover]] had lost the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 Presidential election]] to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], who would take office on March 4, 1933. Reforms lay in the future.\n\n'''Reporters access to the President'''\n\nRoosevelt gave access and received secrecy in exchange.\n\n'''Banking'''\n\nMany things that we take for granted, such as the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]], were only ideas. In a time when bank failures were common, Congress failed to pass more than 150 bills that would have provided some kind of deposit insurance. More than 1/3 of the banks in the United States had failed during the Depression, many because of \u201cruns\u201d created by panicking depositors. The [[1933 Banking Act]] was passed with overwhelming support from the public and became law on June 16, 1933. Although it was eventually considered part the [[New Deal]], President Roosevelt was skeptical about its affects.\n\n'''Totalitarianism and Dictatorships'''\n\n[[Benito Mussolini]] had been established as the President of Italy since his [[Fascism|fascisti]]  took power and gave birth to Fascism. [[Joseph Stalin]] ruled supreme over the [[Soviet Union]], which was enduring the peak of a horrible famine. [[Adolf Hitler]] was named Chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, two months prior to the films opening. On March 23, 1933, the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] gave him power to enact laws without the Reichstag's approval.\n\nHowever, Roosevelt's Presidency in the US did not join the above list. Roosevelt managed to implement his New Deal policies without resorting to the methods used by the film'm fictional President.\n\n'''Food'''\n\nCrops were rotting in the fields. The phenomena summed up in the name [[Dust Bowl]] had not begun. Any idea of the United States having extra crops would soon vanish, and the needs of agricultural workers and farmers would become even greater. The first storm would come in November 1933.\n\n'''Marches'''\n\nTwo marches on Washington may have inspired the one in the film. In January 1932,   [[Cox's Army]], a march of 25,000 unemployed Pennsylvanians led by Father [[James Renshaw Cox]], a Roman Catholic priest, gathered to encourage Congress to start a public works program. In mid-1932 the so-called [[Bonus Army]] consisting of 20,000 [[World War I]] veterans and their families descended on Washington seeking advance payment of bonuses owed to veterans from the [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] administration; several people were killed when troops were ordered to disperse the protesters on June 28. Midwesterners would remember the [[Ford Hunger March]] in Michigan, on March 7, 1932,\n\n'''War'''\n\nOne front of what would be the Second World War had recently opened when [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|the Japanese invaded Manchuria]] on September 18, 1931, beginning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino Japanese War]]. Japan, whose representatives are seen signing the covenant in the film, had for years laid plans to extend its empire through what would become [[World War II]]. The naval actions of WWII, such as the [[Battle of Midway]], proved that indeed the advent of air power has made the traditional battleships obsolete, as predicted in the film. Though terribly devastating, the actual WWII was short of the total apocalypse predicted by the President in the film; similar predictions continue to be made with regard to a potential [[Third World War]].\n\n'''Racketeering and crime'''\n\nCrime was rampant in the Great Depression. An article on history.com, [https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/crime-in-the-great-depression Crime in the Depression], updated in August 2018, describes the conditions that led to Roosevelt's anti-crime legislation.\n\nThe term [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]]  was coined by the [[Employers' Association of Greater Chicago|Employers' Association of Chicago]] in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of [[organized crime]] in the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] union.\n\nNotorious gangster [[Al Capone]] finally went to prison in May 1932 \u2014 for tax evasion.\n\nIn addition to news headlines, popular culture was obsessed with crime and punishment, and moviegoers were flocking to films like [[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]] (1931) and [[The Public Enemy]] (1931) and devouring stories like [[I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!|I am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang]] (January 1932) which would be adapted into a film later that year.\n\nThe [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] would not be known under that name until it became an independent service within the Department of Justice, in 1935.\n\n'''Prohibition'''\n\nThe fictional President Hammond describes [[Prohibition]] as a \u201ccesspool\u201d, and most of the audience would have agreed with him. In 1932, the platform of Democratic presidential candidate [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] included a plank for repealing the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]], and his victory that November marked a certain end to Prohibition. Congress did not wait. The [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] was proposed February 20, 1933, before this film was released.\n\n==Criticism==\nVariety reviewed the film on Dec. 31, 1932. It described the film as \u201cA mess of political tripe superlatively hoked up into a picture of strong popular possibilities...a cleverly executed commercial release... Huston plays the part so persuasively that witnessers will be tricked into accepting its monstrous exaggerations.\u201d Tone and Morley \u201ccarry what amount to walk-on parts and make them look like leads.\u201c<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nReviewing it on April 1, 1933, [[Mordaunt Hall]] of [[The New York Times]] observed \u201cIt is a curious, somewhat fantastic and often melodramatic story, but nevertheless one which at this time is very interesting. It is concerned with a fictitious President of the United States named Judson Hammond ...who in the first sequences is portrayed as a careless partisan politician, becomes an earnest and conscientious President, who tackles the problems of unemployment, crime and the foreign debts something after the fashion of a Lincoln.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/04/01/archives/walter-huston-as-a-president-of-the-united-states-who-proclaims.html|title=Walter Huston as a President of the United States Who Proclaims Himself a Dictator.|last=Hall|first=Mordaunt|date=1933-04-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe film was labeled by ''[[The New Republic]]'' as \"a half-hearted plea for [[Fascism]]\".<ref>Ron Briley, \"The Sun Comes Out Tomorrow,\" in {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntLYUISCZUYC|title=Franklin D.

Located on Camp Cornett at Fort Benning's Harmony Church cantonment area, the RSLC PoI is tailored to train and test the fundamentals of reconnaissance operations for Soldiers and leaders assigned to reconnaissance teams and squads.  Therefore, priority for training is to team leaders and above (pay grades of E-4s and above) assigned oversight of small unit reconnaissance operations without prior reconnaissance training and experience.  In addition to resident course instruction, the RSLC PoI provides opportunities to deliver menu-based training through Mobile Training Teams (MTT) at a requesting unit's home station location.  Menu-based training enables unit commanders to meet specific reconnaissance focused training priorities without sacrificing other training needs in support of a unit's operational mission requirements.  While resident course instruction has priority over menu-based MTT instruction, the RSLC cadre will work to meet every unit's training needs.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase one===\nDuring the first week, students execute a seven-hour land navigation course in which they move under load, cross-country, during daylight and limited visibility, covering approximately 15 kilometers. They receive an introduction to the fundamentals of reconnaissance and surveillance and are taught how to maximize the capabilities of the equipment in the Army\u2019s inventory such as optics, thermals, and cameras. Students learn how to camouflage themselves and equipment, stalking, and selection, occupation, and concealment of surveillance sites. The first week ends with an airborne operation that can accommodate both static line and Military Free-Fall qualified Paratroopers.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase two===\n[[File:US Army RSLC-radio training.jpg|thumb|295px|Students practice configuring their radios prior to communications exam during \"Phase two\" of RSLC]]\n[[File:US Army RSLC-Urban Hideside.jpg|thumb|295px|A student uses an optical [[rangefinder]] to observe an urban environment during \"Phase two\" of RSLC]]\n\nWeek two begins with a two-day communications class that teaches students how to send messages and data across the frequency spectrum, utilizing [[High Frequency]] (HF), [[Very High Frequency]] (VHF), and [[Ultra High Frequency]] (UHF) radios.  This skill enables students to send reports and pictures to their maneuver commander in near real time.  Building on the training from the previous week, students conduct area and zone reconnaissance practical exercises to hone their field craft and improve their reporting formats.  Students are also introduced to insertion and extraction techniques by conducting [[Fast-roping|Fast Rope Insertion/Extraction System]] (FRIES) and [[Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction|Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction System]] (SPIES) training.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase three===\nThe final two weeks are spent with students learning how to plan an operation using the Troop Leading Procedures (TLPs) and incorporating air movement, fires, and evasion and recovery planning.  Following the orders process, students conduct a 48-hour non-graded Situational Training Exercise (STX) where they will execute the mission they just planned under the watchful eye of RSLC instructors, allowing the students to ask questions and receive assistance along the way.  Once this mission is complete and After-Action Reviews (AARs) are conducted, the students go into isolation planning for their graded culminating [[Field training exercise|Field Training Exercise]] (FTX).  Throughout the FTX, students will execute and be graded on all the skills they learned from planning, reconnaissance and surveillance operations, intelligence reporting techniques, communications, fires, evasion and recovery, and small unit tactics to name a few.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\nThe end result is a graduate with the skill to plan and conduct a myriad of reconnaissance and surveillance operations, enhancing the ability of any brigade combat team.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>  Upon successful completion of the RSLC course, U.S. Army graduates are awarded the Six Bravo (6B) additional skill identifier.<ref name=\"History\"/><ref name=\"RSLC Exec Sum\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aerial reconnaissance]]\n* [[Battlefield surveillance brigades in the United States Army]]\n* [[Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron]]\n* [[Reconnaissance vehicle]]\n* [[Reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (United States)]]\n* [[United States Army Armor School#Army Reconnaissance Course|U.S. Army Reconnaissance Course]]\n* [[United States Army Sniper School|U.S. Army Sniper Course]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{TRADOC}}\n\n[[Category:United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name=U.S. Army Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course (RSLC)\n|image=US Army RSLC-Equipment Layout.jpg\n|image_size=300px\n|caption=An instructor goes over the equipment packing list for surface and sub-surface surveillance with students\n|dates=1986\u2014present\n|country={{flag|United States of America}}\n|allegiance= \n|branch={{army|United States}}\n|type=[[Military education and training|Military training]]\n|role=Special skills training\n|size= \n|command_structure=[[File:US Army Infantry School DUI.png|10px]] Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade, [[United States Army Infantry School|U.S. Army Infantry School]]\n|garrison=[[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\n|garrison_label= \n|nickname= \n|patron= \n|motto= \"In Orbe Terrum Non Visi\"\n|colors= \n|colors_label= \n|march= \n|mascot= \n|equipment= \n|equipment_label= \n|battles= \n|anniversaries= \n|decorations= \n|battle_honours=\n|identification_symbol=[[File:US Army Airborne and Ranger Training Bde Flash.svg|100px|center]]\n|identification_symbol_label=[[United States military beret flash|Beret flash]] of the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade and its 4th, 5th, and 6th Ranger Training Battalions\n|identification_symbol_2=[[File:Abn Infantry School Abn Elements.png|120px|center]]\n|identification_symbol_2_label=[[Shoulder sleeve insignia]] of the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade\n}}\n\n'''United States Army Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course''' (RSLC) (formerly known as the Long Range Surveillance Leaders Course, or LRSLC<ref name=\"History\">[http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/rtb/content/PDF/History.pdf Course History, Long Range Surveillance Leaders Course], benning.army.mil, last accessed 28 November 2017</ref>) is a 29-day (four weeks and one day) school designed on mastering reconnaissance fundamentals of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and [[non-commissioned officer]]s eligible for assignments to those units whose primary mission is to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance, target acquisition, and combat assessment operations.

Menu-based training enables unit commanders to meet specific reconnaissance focused training priorities without sacrificing other training needs in support of a unit's operational mission requirements.  While resident course instruction has priority over menu-based MTT instruction, the RSLC cadre will work to meet every unit's training needs.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase one===\nDuring the first week, students execute a seven-hour land navigation course in which they move under load, cross-country, during daylight and limited visibility, covering approximately 15 kilometers. They receive an introduction to the fundamentals of reconnaissance and surveillance and are taught how to maximize the capabilities of the equipment in the Army\u2019s inventory such as optics, thermals, and cameras. Students learn how to camouflage themselves and equipment, stalking, and selection, occupation, and concealment of surveillance sites. The first week ends with an airborne operation that can accommodate both static line and Military Free-Fall qualified Paratroopers.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase two===\n[[File:US Army RSLC-radio training.jpg|thumb|295px|Students practice setting up their radios prior to their communication hands-on test at the RSLC]]\n[[File:US Army RSLC-Urban Hideside.jpg|thumb|295px|A student uses an optical [[rangefinder]] to observe an urban environment during phase two of the RSLC]]\n\nWeek two begins with a two-day communications class that teaches students how to send messages and data across the frequency spectrum, utilizing [[High Frequency]] (HF), [[Very High Frequency]] (VHF), and [[Ultra High Frequency]] (UHF) radios.  This skill enables students to send reports and pictures to their maneuver commander in near real time.  Building on the training from the previous week, students conduct area and zone reconnaissance practical exercises to hone their field craft and improve their reporting formats.  Students are also introduced to insertion and extraction techniques by conducting [[Fast-roping|Fast Rope Insertion/Extraction System]] (FRIES) and [[Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction|Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction System]] (SPIES) training.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase three===\nThe final two weeks are spent with students learning how to plan an operation using the Troop Leading Procedures (TLPs) and incorporating air movement, fires, and evasion and recovery planning.  Following the orders process, students conduct a 48-hour non-graded Situational Training Exercise (STX) where they will execute the mission they just planned under the watchful eye of RSLC instructors, allowing the students to ask questions and receive assistance along the way.  Once this mission is complete and After-Action Reviews (AARs) are conducted, the students go into isolation planning for their graded culminating [[Field training exercise|Field Training Exercise]] (FTX).  Throughout the FTX, students will execute and be graded on all the skills they learned from planning, reconnaissance and surveillance operations, intelligence reporting techniques, communications, fires, evasion and recovery, and small unit tactics to name a few.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\nThe end result is a graduate with the skill to plan and conduct a myriad of reconnaissance and surveillance operations, enhancing the ability of any brigade combat team.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>  Upon successful completion of the RSLC course, U.S. Army graduates are awarded the Six Bravo (6B) additional skill identifier.<ref name=\"History\"/><ref name=\"RSLC Exec Sum\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aerial reconnaissance]]\n* [[Battlefield surveillance brigades in the United States Army]]\n* [[Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron]]\n* [[Reconnaissance vehicle]]\n* [[Reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (United States)]]\n* [[United States Army Armor School#Army Reconnaissance Course|U.S. Army Reconnaissance Course]]\n* [[United States Army Sniper School|U.S. Army Sniper Course]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{TRADOC}}\n\n[[Category:United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course]]\n", "name_user": "McChizzle", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePhase two:Continuing previous", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Reconnaissance_and_Surveillance_Leaders_Course"}

With starting quarterback [[McKenzie Milton]] out for the season, the Knights rallied from a 17-point halftime deficit behind back-up quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. and won the conference championship for the second year in a row, and fourth time overall.\n\n==Teams==\n===Memphis===\n{{main|2018 Memphis Tigers football team}}\nUnder the leadership of third-year head coach [[Mike Norvell]], the Memphis Tigers entered the American Championship with a record of 8\u20134, 5\u20133 in conference play. They started the season 3\u20132, with both losses in-conference (at [[2018 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]], at [[2018 Tulane Green Wave football team|Tulane]]). They rebounded by annihilating [[2018 Connecticut Huskies football team|Connecticut]] at home, but then lost to No. 10 [[2018 UCF Knights football team|UCF]]. Following a non-conference loss the following week, the Tigers improved on their 4\u20134 record by winning all four of their remaining games, giving them a four-game win streak coming into their American title game rematch with the Knights.\n\n===UCF===\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights football team}}\nWith first-year head coach [[Josh Heupel]] at the helm, the No. 7 Knights entered the American title game riding a 24-game win streak dating back to the start of their [[2017 UCF Knights football team|2017 season]]. Prior to the contest, their record stood at 11\u20130, 8\u20130 in conference play. The Knights opened the season ranked 21st in the AP poll, but steadily improved with wins over Connecticut, [[2018 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh]], [[2018 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis]], [[2018 Temple Owls football team|Temple]], No. 19 [[2018 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]], and [[2018 South Florida Bulls football team|South Florida]]. The Knights entered the AAC Championship with a 12\u20131 record all-time against the Tigers; Memphis won their first meeting in 1990 and UCF took every matchup since. However, they faced a potentially devastating blow when the quarterback who had led them through their ongoing winning streak, [[McKenzie Milton]], suffered a catastrophic knee injury in the South Florida game.\n{{-}}\n\n==Game summary==\n===First quarter===\nUCF won the coin toss and elected to defer to the second half. On the fourth play of the game, Tigers running back [[Darrell Henderson]] broke free for a 62-yard touchdown run, and a quick 7\u20130 lead for Memphis. Knights quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. then fumbled away the ball at the UCF 27, leading to Henderson's second touchdown. The Knights finally got on the board, going 65 yards in 7 plays, with a 14-yard touchdown run by Greg McCrae. The Memphis rushing attack struck again quickly. Facing 3rd & 4 at their own 30 yard line, [[Patrick Taylor (American football)|Patrick Taylor Jr.]] broke free for a 70-yard touchdown, and 21\u20137 lead. The miscues for the Knights continued, as Mack was sacked and fumbled, leading to a Tigers field goal and a shocking 24\u20137 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\n===Second quarter===\nAs the second quarter began, the Knights were driving into Tigers territory. A 20-yard completion from Mack to [[Gabriel Davis]] sparked the drive, and UCF eventually reached the red zone. Facing 3rd & Goal at the 6, Mack ran up the middle for an apparent touchdown, but the ball was fumbled and bouncing live into the endzone, dangerously close to going out-of-bounds. Michael Colubiale fell on the ball and recovered it for the UCF touchdown. [[Darrell Henderson]] continued to punish the Knights defense. On the second play of the next drive, he blasted for an 82-yard touchdown run, and a 31\u201314 Tigers lead. With under 4 minutes left in the half, a Memphis punt set UCF deep at their own 6 yard line. Mack threw a 44-yard pass to Gabriel Davis, then Greg McCrae broke free for a 47-yard run all the way to the 3 yard line. Mack's 4 yard touchdown pass to Jake Hescock made the score 31\u201321. The Knights forced a 3-and-out and Memphis punted with 1:50 remaining. But Otis Anderson muffed the punt, and Memphis recovered. With 21 seconds left in the half, [[Darrell Henderson]] connected with Sean Dykes for a 4-yard touchdown pass, and the Tigers led 38\u201321 at halftime.\n\n===Third quarter===\nUCF received the ball to start the third quarter, and proceeded to dominate the second half. The Knights would score five touchdown on five consecutive drives, erasing a 17-point deficit, and held the Tigers to only three points in the second half. [[Darrell Henderson]] was held to only 3 yards in the second half, while Darriel Mack Jr. threw for a touchdown, and ran for four more. Mack sparked the rally with a 54-yard touchdown to a wide-open Otis Anderson, who ran untouched to the endzone. Later, Memphis managed to drive to the UCF 2 yard line, but Brady White's pass to the endzone fell incomplete off the fingertips of Damonte Coxie as he hit the ground. The Tigers settled for a field goal, and clung to a 41\u201335 lead.\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nThe Knights took their first lead of the game (42\u201341) with a touchdown in the opening seconds of the fourth quarter. With 9:26 remaining, Memphis kicker Riley Patterson missed a 36-yard field goal attempt, and the Knights held their lead.

With starting quarterback [[McKenzie Milton]] out for the season, the Knights rallied from a 17-point halftime deficit behind back-up quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. and won the conference championship for the second year in a row, and fourth time overall.\n\n==Teams==\n===Memphis===\n{{main|2018 Memphis Tigers football team}}\nUnder the leadership of third-year head coach [[Mike Norvell]], the Memphis Tigers entered the American Championship with a record of 8\u20134, 5\u20133 in conference play. They started the season 3\u20132, with both losses in-conference (at [[2018 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]], at [[2018 Tulane Green Wave football team|Tulane]]). They rebounded by annihilating [[2018 Connecticut Huskies football team|Connecticut]] at home, but then lost to No. 10 [[2018 UCF Knights football team|UCF]]. Following a non-conference loss the following week, the Tigers improved on their 4\u20134 record by winning all four of their remaining games, giving them a four-game win streak coming into their American title game rematch with the Knights.\n\n===UCF===\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights football team}}\nWith first-year head coach [[Josh Heupel]] at the helm, the No. 7 Knights entered the American title game riding a 24-game win streak dating back to the start of their [[2017 UCF Knights football team|2017 season]]. Prior to the contest, their record stood at 11\u20130, 8\u20130 in conference play. The Knights opened the season ranked 21st in the AP poll, but steadily improved with wins over Connecticut, [[2018 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh]], [[2018 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis]], [[2018 Temple Owls football team|Temple]], No. 19 [[2018 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]], and [[2018 South Florida Bulls football team|South Florida]]. The Knights entered the AAC Championship with a 12\u20131 record all-time against the Tigers; Memphis won their first meeting in 1990 and UCF took every matchup since. However, they faced a potentially devastating blow when the quarterback who had led them through their ongoing winning streak, [[McKenzie Milton]], suffered a catastrophic knee injury in the South Florida game.\n{{-}}\n\n==Game summary==\n===First quarter===\nUCF won the coin toss and elected to defer to the second half. On the fourth play of the game, Tigers running back [[Darrell Henderson]] broke free for a 62-yard touchdown run, and a quick 7\u20130 lead for Memphis. Knights quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. then fumbled away the ball at the UCF 27, leading to Henderson's second touchdown. The Knights finally got on the board, going 65 yards in 7 plays, with a 14-yard touchdown run by Greg McCrae. The Memphis rushing attack struck again quickly. Facing 3rd & 4 at their own 30 yard line, Patrick Taylor Jr. broke free for a 70-yard touchdown, and 21\u20137 lead. The miscues for the Knights continued, as Mack was sacked and fumbled, leading to a Tigers field goal and a shocking 24\u20137 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\n===Second quarter===\nAs the second quarter began, the Knights were driving into Tigers territory. A 20-yard completion from Mack to [[Gabriel Davis]] sparked the drive, and UCF eventually reached the red zone. Facing 3rd & Goal at the 6, Mack ran up the middle for an apparent touchdown, but the ball was fumbled and bouncing live into the endzone, dangerously close to going out-of-bounds. Michael Colubiale fell on the ball and recovered it for the UCF touchdown. [[Darrell Henderson]] continued to punish the Knights defense. On the second play of the next drive, he blasted for an 82-yard touchdown run, and a 31\u201314 Tigers lead. With under 4 minutes left in the half, a Memphis punt set UCF deep at their own 6 yard line. Mack threw a 44-yard pass to Gabriel Davis, then Greg McCrae broke free for a 47-yard run all the way to the 3 yard line. Mack's 4 yard touchdown pass to Jake Hescock made the score 31\u201321. The Knights forced a 3-and-out and Memphis punted with 1:50 remaining. But Otis Anderson muffed the punt, and Memphis recovered. With 21 seconds left in the half, [[Darrell Henderson]] connected with Sean Dykes for a 4-yard touchdown pass, and the Tigers led 38\u201321 at halftime.\n\n===Third quarter===\nUCF received the ball to start the third quarter, and proceeded to dominate the second half. The Knights would score five touchdown on five consecutive drives, erasing a 17-point deficit, and held the Tigers to only three points in the second half. [[Darrell Henderson]] was held to only 3 yards in the second half, while Darriel Mack Jr. threw for a touchdown, and ran for four more. Mack sparked the rally with a 54-yard touchdown to a wide-open Otis Anderson, who ran untouched to the endzone. Later, Memphis managed to drive to the UCF 2 yard line, but Brady White's pass to the endzone fell incomplete off the fingertips of Damonte Coxie as he hit the ground. The Tigers settled for a field goal, and clung to a 41\u201335 lead.\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nThe Knights took their first lead of the game (42\u201341) with a touchdown in the opening seconds of the fourth quarter. With 9:26 remaining, Memphis kicker Riley Patterson missed a 36-yard field goal attempt, and the Knights held their lead. UCF iced the game with two more touchdown, and an interception in the endzone with 33 seconds to go.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=401056699|title=Mack shines, No. 7 UCF beats Memphis 56-41 for AAC title|publisher=ESPN.com|date=December 2, 2018|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nQuarterback Darriel Mack Jr., in only his second start for the Knights, finished with 348 yard passing, 1 touchdown pass, 59 yards rushing, and 4 rushing touchdowns, to claim the game's MVP honors.

Do not rename without keeping in sync. -->\n\nThe initial version of [[CP/M-86 1.0]] (with BDOS 2.x) was adapted and became available to the [[IBM PC]] in 1982. It was commercially unsuccessful as [[IBM]]'s [[PC&nbsp;DOS 1.0]] offered much the same facilities for a considerably lower price. Like PC&nbsp;DOS, CP/M-86 did not fully exploit the power and capabilities of the new 16-bit machine.\n\nIt was soon supplemented by an implementation of CP/M's multitasking 'big brother', [[MP/M-86 2.0]] since September 1981. This turned a PC into a multiuser machine capable of supporting multiple [[concurrent user]]s using [[dumb terminal]]s attached by [[serial port]]s. The environment presented to each user made it seem as if they had the entire computer to themselves. Since terminals cost a fraction of the then-substantial price of a complete PC, this offered considerable cost savings, as well as facilitating multi-user applications such as accounts or stock control in a time when PC networks were rare, very expensive and difficult to implement.\n\n[[CP/M-86 1.1]] (with [[BDOS]] 2.2) and MP/M-86 2.1 were merged to create Concurrent CP/M-86 3.0 (also known as CCP/M-86) with BDOS 3.0 in late 1982.<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/> One of its designers was Francis \"Frank\" R. Holsworth.<ref name=\"Wein_2002\"/><ref name=\"Holsworth_2006\"/> Initially, this was a single-user operating system supporting true multi-tasking of up to four (in its default configuration) CP/M-86 compatible programs. Like its predecessors it could be configured for [[multi-processor]] support (see f.e. [[Concurrent CP/M-86/80]]) and also added \"virtual screens\" letting an operator switch between the interactions of multiple programs.<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/> Later versions supported dumb terminals and so could be deployed as multiuser systems. Concurrent CP/M-86 3.1 (BDOS 3.1) shipped on 21 February 1984.<ref name=\"DRI_1984_CCPM31\"/>\n\n===Adaptations===\n\n===={{anchor|CCP/M-86 with Windows}}Concurrent CP/M-86 with Windows====\nIn February 1984 Digital Research also offered a version of Concurrent CP/M-86 with windowing capabilities named '''Concurrent CP/M with Windows for the IBM Personal Computer and Personal Computer XT'''.<ref name=\"CCPM_1984\"/>\n\n===={{anchor|CCP/M-86/80}}Concurrent CP/M-86/80====\nThis was an adaptation of Concurrent CP/M-86 for the [[LSI-M4]], [[LSI Computers|LSI]] [[LSI Octopus|Octopus]]<ref name=\"LSI_Octopus\"/> and [[CAL PC]] computers. These machines had both 16-bit and 8-bit processors, because in the early days of 16-bit personal computing, 8-bit software was more available and often ran faster than the corresponding 16-bit software. Concurrent CP/M-86/80 allowed users to run both CP/M (8-bit) and CP/M-86 (16-bit) applications. When a command was entered, the operating system ran the corresponding application on either the 8-bit or the 16-bit processor, depending on whether the executable file had a [[.COM (file extension)|.COM]] or [[CMD file (CP/M)|.CMD]] extension. It emulated a CP/M environment for 8-bit programs by translating CP/M system calls into CP/M-86 system calls, which were then executed by the 16-bit processor.<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/>\n{{SeeAlso|CP/M-86/80|CP/M 8-16|MP/M 8-16}}\n\n=={{anchor|PCMODE|CDOS}}Concurrent DOS==\n<!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article.

The release of Concurrent DOS 286 had been scheduled for late May, but was delayed until Intel could develop a new version of the chip.<ref name=\"Infoworld_1985_Super\"/> In August, after extensive testing E-1 step samples of the 80286, Digital Research said that Intel had corrected all documented 286 [[errata]], but that there were still undocumented chip performance problems with the prerelease version of Concurrent DOS 286 running on the E-1 step. Intel said that the approach Digital Research wished to take in emulating 8086 software in protected mode differed from the original specifications; nevertheless they incorporated into the E-2 step minor changes in the [[microcode]] that allowed Digital Research to run emulation mode much faster (see [[286 LOADALL|LOADALL]]).<ref name=\"Infoworld_1985_80286\"/><ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-2\"/> These same limitations affected [[FlexOS 286]] version 1.x, a reengineered derivation of Concurrent DOS 286,<ref name=\"DRI_1986_FlexOS286\"/><ref name=\"CBR_1987_FlexOS-286\"/> which was developed by Digital Research's new Flexible Automation Business Unit in Monterey, CA, since 1986.\n\nLater versions added compatibility with PC DOS 2.x and 3.x.\n\nKnown versions include:\n\n* Concurrent DOS 286 1.0 (1985)<ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-2\"/>\n* Concurrent DOS 286 1.1 (1986-01-07)<ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-2\"/>\n* Concurrent DOS 286 1.2 (1986)<ref name=\"Meta_1986_HighC12\"/>\n* [[FlexOS 286 1.3]] (November 1986)<ref name=\"DRI_1986_FlexOS286\"/>\n* [[FlexOS 286 1.31]] (May 1987)\n\n==={{anchor|VIOS|CDOS386|CPCDOS5.0|CPCDOS5.2|CDOSXM}}Concurrent DOS XM and Concurrent DOS 386===\n[[File:Digital Research Concurrent DOS XM Release 6.0 720x400.png|thumb|Digital Research Concurrent DOS XM Release 6.0]]\n[[File:Digital Research Concurrent DOS 386 Release 2.0 720x400.png|thumb|Digital Research Concurrent DOS 386 Release 2.0]]\nThe OEM Support Group was relocated into Digital Research's newly created European Development Centre (EDC) in [[Hungerford]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1986, which started to take over further development of the Concurrent DOS family since Concurrent DOS 4.11, including siblings like [[DOS Plus]] and successors.\n\nDeveloped in Hungerford, UK, versions 5 and 6 (Concurrent DOS XM, with XM standing for [[Expanded Memory]]) could [[bank switching|bank switch]] up to 8&nbsp;MB of [[Enhanced Expanded Memory Specification|EEMS]] to provide a real-mode environment to run multiple CP/M-86 and DOS programs concurrently and support up to three users (one local and up to two hooked up via serial terminals).\n\nIn 1987, Concurrent DOS 86 was rewritten to become Concurrent DOS 386,<ref name=\"IW_1987_MDOS386\"/> still a continuation of the classical XIOS & BDOS architecture.<!-- in contrast to Concurrent DOS 68K, Concurrent DOS 286 and FlexOS --> This ran on machines equipped with the [[Intel]] [[Intel 80386|80386]] and later processors, using the 386's hardware facilities for [[Hardware-assisted virtualization|virtualizing]] the hardware, allowing most DOS applications to run unmodified under Concurrent DOS 386, even on terminals. The OS supported concurrent multiuser file access, allowing multiuser applications to run as if they were on individual PCs attached to a network [[Server (computing)|server]]. Concurrent DOS 386 allowed a single server to support a number of users on dumb terminals or inexpensive low-specification PCs running terminal emulation software, without the need for expensive workstations and then-expensive network cards.

It required its own special [[device driver]]s for much common hardware, as PC DOS drivers were not multiuser or multi-tasking aware. Driver installation was more complex than the simple PC DOS method of copying the files onto the boot disk and modifying CONFIG.SYS appropriately{{snd}} it was necessary to relink the Multiuser DOS [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]] (known as a ''nucleus'') using the [[SYSGEN]] command.\n\nMultiuser DOS was also unable to use many common PC DOS additions such as [[network stack]]s, and it was limited in its ability to support later developments in the PC-compatible world, such as [[graphics adaptor]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[CD-ROM]] drives and mice. Although many of these were soon rectified{{snd}} for example, graphical terminals were developed, allowing users to use [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] and [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] software{{snd}} it was less flexible in this regard than a network of individual PCs, and as the prices of these fell, it became less and less competitive, although it still offered benefits in terms of management and lower total cost of ownership. As a multi-user operating system its price was higher than a single-user system, of course, and it required special device drivers, unlike single-user multitasking DOS add-ons such as [[Quarterdeck Office Systems|Quarterdeck's]] [[DESQview]].

It used [[pre-emptive multitasking]], preventing badly-written applications from delaying other processes by retaining control of the processor. To this day, Multiuser DOS is supported by popular [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] libraries such as [[wolfSSL]]. \n\nThe [[API]] provided support for blocking and non-blocking [[message queue]]s, mutual-exclusion queues, the ability to create sub-process [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] which executed independently from the parent, and a method of pausing execution which did not waste processor cycles, unlike idle loops used by single-user operating systems. Applications were started as \"attached\" to a [[virtual console|console]]. However, if an application did not need user interaction it could \"detach\" from the console and run as a [[background process]], later reattaching to a console if needed.\n\nAnother key feature was that the [[memory management]] supported a \"shared\" [[Memory model (computing)|memory model]] for processes (in addition to the usual models available to normal DOS programs). In the shared memory model the \"code\" and \"data\" sections of a program were isolated from each other. Because the \"code\" contained no modifiable data, code sections in memory could be shared by several processes running the same program, thereby reducing memory requirements.\n\nPrograms written, or adapted, for any [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] platform need to avoid the technique used by single-tasking systems of going into endless loops until interrupted when, for example, waiting for a user to press a key; this wasted processor time that could be used by other processes. Instead, Concurrent DOS provided an API call which a process could call to \"sleep\" for a period of time. Later versions of the Concurrent DOS kernel included Idle Detection, which monitored [[DOS API]] calls to determine whether the application was doing useful work or in fact idle, in which case the process was suspended allowing other processes to run. Idle Detection was the catalyst for the patented [[DR-DOS]] [[Dynamic Idle Detection]] power management feature invented in 1989 by Roger Alan Gross and John P. Constant and marketed as [[BatteryMAX]].<ref name=\"US5355501\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[CP/M]]\n* [[MP/M]]\n* [[Concurrent DOS V60]]\n* [[FlexOS]]\n* [[DR&nbsp;DOS]]\n* [[PC DOS]] \u2013 IBM's OEM version of (single-user) MS-DOS\n* [[MS-DOS 4.0 (multitasking)]]\n* [[PC-MOS/386]] \u2013 unrelated multitasking DOS clone\n* [[VM/386]] \u2013 unrelated multitasking DOS environment\n* [[Virtual DOS machine]]\n* [[Multiuser DOS Federation]]\n* [[Timeline of operating systems]]\n* [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Citrix]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"RM_1996_754\">{{cite web |author-first=R. |author-last=M. |title=REAL/32 Upgrade Disk - Version 7.54 - Batch 08-96-01 - SRN0167.WP |id=R32UP754.ZIP |date=1996-07-31 |url=http://contents.driverguide.com/content.php?id=582964&path=SRN0167.TXT |access-date=2017-01-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826200229/https://contents.driverguide.com/content.php?id=582964&path=SRN0167.TXT |archive-date=2018-08-26}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"DRI_1984_CCPM31\">Digital Research (1984): ''Concurrent CP/M ships early in response to team effort''.

This chameleon operating system allows ICL and other [[Intel 80286|80286]] manufacturers to build machines that will be able to cope with all the existing body of IBM-PC software -- and at the same time promise multi-tasking, windowing and true concurrency, three features that together allow a single micro to do several things at once. [\u2026] Although no firm announcements have been made, it seems certain that by the end of the year [[Applied Computer Techniques|ACT]] will be offering a [[Concurrent CP/M-286|Concurrent CP/M 286]] machine to fuel its drive into the corporate market. But by this time it will have to contend with [[IBM]]'s own 80286 office micro, the PC/AT. [\u2026] IBM also have a software product in the offing that could pull the rug out from under the Concurrent contenders. Some 180K in size, [[TopView]] is a program for IBM PC's and AT's that beefs up the operating system to provide windowing facilities for existing 'well behaved' standard packages.

PC]]-compatible microcomputers.\n\nAn evolution of the older '''Concurrent CP/M-86''', '''Concurrent DOS''' and '''Concurrent DOS 386''' operating systems, it was originally developed by [[Digital Research]] and acquired and further developed by [[Novell]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Scott_1991\"/><ref name=\"BW_1991\"/><ref name=\"Allchin_1992\"/> Its ancestry lies in the earlier Digital Research [[8-bit]] operating systems [[CP/M]] and [[MP/M]], and the [[16-bit]] single-tasking [[CP/M-86]] which evolved from CP/M.\n\nWhen Novell abandoned Multiuser DOS in 1992, the three Master [[Value Added Reseller]]s (VARs) [[DataPac Australasia]], [[Concurrent Controls]]<ref name=\"Barney_1994_CCI\"/> and [[Intelligent Micro Software]]<ref name=\"Pontin_1995_IMS\"/> were allowed to take over and continued independent development into Datapac Multiuser DOS and System Manager, CCI Multiuser DOS, and IMS Multiuser DOS and REAL/32.<ref name=\"Pontin_1995_IMS\"/>\n\nThe [[FlexOS]] line, which evolved from [[Concurrent DOS 286]] and [[Concurrent DOS 68K]], was sold off to [[Integrated Systems Inc.|Integrated Systems]], Inc. (ISI) in July 1994.\n\n=={{anchor|CCP/M-86}}Concurrent CP/M-86==\n{{See also|MP/M#MP/M-86{{!}}MP/M-86}}\n<!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article. Do not rename without keeping in sync. -->\n\nThe initial version of [[CP/M-86 1.0]] (with BDOS 2.x) was adapted and became available to the [[IBM PC]] in 1982. It was commercially unsuccessful as [[IBM]]'s [[PC&nbsp;DOS 1.0]] offered much the same facilities for a considerably lower price. Like PC&nbsp;DOS, CP/M-86 did not fully exploit the power and capabilities of the new 16-bit machine.\n\nIt was soon supplemented by an implementation of CP/M's multitasking 'big brother', [[MP/M-86 2.0]] since September 1981. This turned a PC into a multiuser machine capable of supporting multiple [[concurrent user]]s using [[dumb terminal]]s attached by [[serial port]]s. The environment presented to each user made it seem as if they had the entire computer to themselves. Since terminals cost a fraction of the then-substantial price of a complete PC, this offered considerable cost savings, as well as facilitating multi-user applications such as accounts or stock control in a time when PC networks were rare, very expensive and difficult to implement.\n\n[[CP/M-86 1.1]] (with [[BDOS]] 2.2) and MP/M-86 2.1 were merged to create Concurrent CP/M-86 3.0 (also known as CCP/M-86) with BDOS 3.0 in late 1982.<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/> One of its designers was Francis \"Frank\" R. Holsworth.<ref name=\"Wein_2002\"/><ref name=\"Holsworth_2006\"/> Initially, this was a single-user operating system supporting true multi-tasking of up to four (in its default configuration) CP/M-86 compatible programs. Like its predecessors it could be configured for [[multi-processor]] support (see f.e. [[Concurrent CP/M-86/80]]) and also added \"virtual screens\" letting an operator switch between the interactions of multiple programs.<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/> Later versions supported dumb terminals and so could be deployed as multiuser systems. Concurrent CP/M-86 3.1 (BDOS 3.1) shipped on 21 February 1984.<ref name=\"DRI_1984_CCPM31\"/>\n\n===Adaptations===\n\n===={{anchor|CCP/M-86 with Windows}}Concurrent CP/M-86 with Windows====\nIn February 1984 Digital Research also offered a version of Concurrent CP/M-86 with windowing capabilities named '''Concurrent CP/M with Windows for the IBM Personal Computer and Personal Computer XT'''.<ref name=\"CCPM_1984\"/>\n\n===={{anchor|CCP/M-86/80}}Concurrent CP/M-86/80====\nThis was an adaptation of Concurrent CP/M-86 for the [[LSI-M4]], [[LSI Computers|LSI]] [[LSI Octopus|Octopus]]<ref name=\"LSI_Octopus\"/> and [[CAL PC]] computers. These machines had both 16-bit and 8-bit processors, because in the early days of 16-bit personal computing, 8-bit software was more available and often ran faster than the corresponding 16-bit software. Concurrent CP/M-86/80 allowed users to run both CP/M (8-bit) and CP/M-86 (16-bit) applications. When a command was entered, the operating system ran the corresponding application on either the 8-bit or the 16-bit processor, depending on whether the executable file had a [[.COM (file extension)|.COM]] or [[CMD file (CP/M)|.CMD]] extension. It emulated a CP/M environment for 8-bit programs by translating CP/M system calls into CP/M-86 system calls, which were then executed by the 16-bit processor.<ref name=\"Kildall_1982_8-bit\"/>\n{{SeeAlso|CP/M-86/80|CP/M 8-16|MP/M 8-16}}\n\n=={{anchor|PCMODE|CDOS}}Concurrent DOS==\n<!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article.

Pedrizetti]], Dave Brown and [[Gordon Edmonds]] teamed up to create PC-MODE,<ref name=\"DRI_1984_PCMODE\"/> an optional module for Concurrent CP/M-86 3.1<ref name=\"DRI_1984_CCPM31b\"/><ref name=\"DRI_1984_MicroNotes1\"/> (with BDOS 3.1) to provide basic compatibility with [[PC DOS 1.1]] (and [[MS-DOS 1.1]]).<ref name=\"DRI_1984_MicroNotes1\"/><!-- However, DRI always targetted PC DOS compatibility, not MS-DOS compatibility and the emulator reports itself with OEM=IBM, not MS. --> This was shown publicly at [[COMDEX]] in December 1983<ref name=\"DRI_1984_PCMODE\"/> and shipped in March 1984 as Concurrent DOS 3.1 (a.k.a. CDOS with BDOS 3.1) to hardware vendors.<ref name=\"DRI_1984_CDOS31\"/><ref name=\"DRI_1984_MicroNotes2\"/> Simple DOS applications, which did not directly access the screen or other hardware, could be run. For example, although a console program such as [[PKZIP]] worked perfectly and offered more facilities than the CP/M-native [[ARC (file format)|ARC]] archiver, applications which performed screen manipulations, such as the [[WordStar]] [[word processor]] for DOS, would not, and native Concurrent CP/M (or CP/M-86) versions were required.\n\nWhile Concurrent DOS 3.1 up to 4.1 had been developed in the US, OEM adaptations and localizations were carried out by [[DR Europe]]'s OEM Support Group in Newbury, UK,<ref name=\"DRI_1984_MicroNotes3\"/> since 1983.<!-- possibly late 1982 already? -->\n\nDigital Research positioned [[Concurrent DOS 4.1]] with [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]] as alternative for [[IBM]]'s [[TopView]] in 1985.<ref name=\"CW_1985_CDOS41\"/><!-- Concurrent DOS 4.1 (with BDOS 4.1) in 198?4 was compatible with PC DOS 2.x and was available for many different hardware platforms, the version with an IBM PC compatible BIOS/XIOS was named Concurrent PC DOS 4.1. -->\n\n==={{anchor|CDOS86|CPCDOS|CPCDOS3.2|CPCDOS4.1|CPCDOS4.11}}Concurrent PC DOS===\nConcurrent DOS 3.2 (with BDOS 3.2) in 1984 was compatible with applications for CP/M-86 1.x, Concurrent CP/M-86 3.x and PC DOS 2.0.<!-- July 1984 ref specifies CPCDOS without version number, but mentions PC DOS 2.0 compatibility --><ref name=\"DRI_1984_MicroNotes3\"/> It was available for many different hardware platforms.

One of its main architects was Francis \"Frank\" R.

Like the earlier<!-- 1984 --> [[GEMDOS]] system for 68000 processors it initially ran on the Motorola [[VME board|VME]]/10 development system<!-- but was also adapted to Compupro systems -->.<ref name=\"DRI_1984_MicroNotes1\"/> Concurrent DOS 68K 1.20/1.21 was available in April 1986,<ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-1\"/><ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-2\"/><ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-3\"/> offered for about {{val|200000|u=dollars}} to OEMs.<ref name=\"Knox_1986_CDOS68K\"/> This system evolved into [[FlexOS 68K]] in late 1986.\n\nKnown versions include:\n\n* Concurrent DOS 68K 1.0 (1985)<ref name=\"Knox_1986_CDOS68K\"/>\n* Concurrent DOS 68K 1.1<!-- mentioned in VMCONFIG.C --><ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-2\"/>\n* Concurrent DOS 68K 1.20 (April 1986,<ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-1\"/><ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-2\"/><ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-3\"/> 1986-05-27<!-- mentioned in VMCONFIG.C --><ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-2\"/>)\n* Concurrent DOS 68K 1.21 (1986)<ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-1\"/><ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-2\"/><ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-3\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|CCPM286|CDOS286|FlexOS}}Concurrent DOS 286 and FlexOS 286===\nIn parallel to the Concurrent DOS 68K effort,<ref name=\"Knox_1986_CDOS68K\"/> Digital Research also previewed Concurrent DOS 286<ref name=\"BYTE_1985_CDOS286\"/> in cooperation with [[Intel]] in January 1985. This was based on [[MP/M-286]] and [[Concurrent CP/M-286]], on which Digital Research had worked on since 1982.<ref name=\"Swaine_1982_MPM286\"/><ref name=\"Bidmead_1985_CCPM286\"/>\n\nConcurrent DOS 286 was a complete rewrite in the [[C (programming language)|C language]] based on a new system architecture with dynamically loadable device drivers instead of a static BIOS or XIOS.<ref name=\"BYTE_1985_CDOS286\"/> One of its main architects was Francis \"Frank\" R.

The release of Concurrent DOS 286 had been scheduled for late May, but was delayed until Intel could develop a new version of the chip.<ref name=\"Infoworld_1985_Super\"/> In August, after extensive testing E-1 step samples of the 80286, Digital Research said that Intel had corrected all documented 286 [[errata]], but that there were still undocumented chip performance problems with the prerelease version of Concurrent DOS 286 running on the E-1 step. Intel said that the approach Digital Research wished to take in emulating 8086 software in protected mode differed from the original specifications; nevertheless they incorporated into the E-2 step minor changes in the [[microcode]] that allowed Digital Research to run emulation mode much faster (see [[286 LOADALL|LOADALL]]).<ref name=\"Infoworld_1985_80286\"/><ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-2\"/> These same limitations affected [[FlexOS 286]] version 1.x, a reengineered derivation of Concurrent DOS 286,<ref name=\"DRI_1986_FlexOS286\"/><ref name=\"CBR_1987_FlexOS-286\"/> which was developed by Digital Research's new Flexible Automation Business Unit in Monterey, CA, since 1986.\n\nLater versions added compatibility with PC DOS 2.x and 3.x.\n\nKnown versions include:\n\n* Concurrent DOS 286 1.0 (1985)<ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-2\"/>\n* Concurrent DOS 286 1.1 (1986-01-07)<ref name=\"DRI_1986_CDOS68K-2\"/>\n* Concurrent DOS 286 1.2 (1986)<ref name=\"Meta_1986_HighC12\"/>\n* [[FlexOS 286 1.3]] (November 1986)<ref name=\"DRI_1986_FlexOS286\"/>\n* [[FlexOS 286 1.31]] (May 1987)\n\n==={{anchor|VIOS|CDOS386|CPCDOS5.0|CPCDOS5.2|CDOSXM}}Concurrent DOS XM and Concurrent DOS 386===\n[[File:Digital Research Concurrent DOS XM Release 6.0 720x400.png|thumb|Digital Research Concurrent DOS XM Release 6.0]]\n[[File:Digital Research Concurrent DOS 386 Release 2.0 720x400.png|thumb|Digital Research Concurrent DOS 386 Release 2.0]]\nThe OEM Support Group was relocated into Digital Research's newly created European Development Centre (EDC) in [[Hungerford]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1986, which started to take over further development of the Concurrent DOS family since Concurrent DOS 4.11, including siblings like [[DOS Plus]] and successors.\n\nDeveloped in Hungerford, UK, versions 5 and 6 (Concurrent DOS XM, with XM standing for [[Expanded Memory]]) could [[bank switching|bank switch]] up to 8&nbsp;MB of [[Enhanced Expanded Memory Specification|EEMS]] to provide a real-mode environment to run multiple CP/M-86 and DOS programs concurrently and support up to three users (one local and up to two hooked up via serial terminals).\n\nIn 1987, Concurrent DOS 86 was rewritten to become Concurrent DOS 386,<ref name=\"IW_1987_MDOS386\"/> still a continuation of the classical XIOS & BDOS architecture.<!-- in contrast to Concurrent DOS 68K, Concurrent DOS 286 and FlexOS --> This ran on machines equipped with the [[Intel]] [[Intel 80386|80386]] and later processors, using the 386's hardware facilities for [[Hardware-assisted virtualization|virtualizing]] the hardware, allowing most DOS applications to run unmodified under Concurrent DOS 386, even on terminals. The OS supported concurrent multiuser file access, allowing multiuser applications to run as if they were on individual PCs attached to a network [[Server (computing)|server]]. Concurrent DOS 386 allowed a single server to support a number of users on dumb terminals or inexpensive low-specification PCs running terminal emulation software, without the need for expensive workstations and then-expensive network cards. It was a true multiuser system; several users could use a single database with [[record locking]] to prevent mutual interference.\n\nConcurrent DOS 6.0 represented also the starting point for the [[DR DOS]] family, which was carved out of it.\n\n{{SeeAlso|GEM XM}}\n\nKnown versions include:\n\n* DR Concurrent PC DOS XM 5.0 (BDOS 5.0)\n* DR Concurrent DOS XM 5.0 (BDOS 5.0, October 1986)\n* DR Concurrent DOS XM 5.1 (BDOS 5.1?, January 1987)\n* DR Concurrent DOS XM 5.2 (BDOS 5.2?, September 1987)<ref name=\"Angus_1987_52-11\"/><ref name=\"CDOSXM52_2001\"/><ref name=\"Fisher_1987_CompuPro\"/>\n* DR Concurrent DOS XM 6.0 (BDOS 6.0, 1987-11-18),<!-- reports as PC DOS 3.30, %OS%=CDOS, %VER%=6.0 --><ref name=\"Ryan_1987\"/><ref name=\"CDOS60\">http://www.retro-computing.org/?page=item&id=298#mainphoto</ref> 6.01 (1987)\n* DR Concurrent DOS XM 6.2 (BDOS 6.2),<!-- %OS%=CDOS, %VER%=6.2 --><ref name=\"CDOS386_COMDEX\"/> 6.21\n;<br/>\n;\n* DR Concurrent DOS 386 1.0 (BDOS 5.0?, 1987)\n* DR Concurrent DOS 386 1.1 (BDOS 5.2?, September 1987)<ref name=\"Angus_1987_52-11\"/>\n* DR Concurrent DOS 386 2.0 (BDOS 6.0, 1987-11-18<!-- reports as PC DOS 3.30, %OS%=CDOS386, %VER%=2.0-->),<ref name=\"Ryan_1987\"/> 2.01<!-- (BDOS 6.?) --><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/>\n* DR Concurrent DOS 386 3.0 (BDOS 6.2, 1988-12, 1989-01<!-- %OS%=CDOS386, %VER%=3.0 -->),<ref name=\"CDOS386_COMDEX\"/> 3.01 (1989-05-19), 3.02 (1989)\n\nConcurrent PC DOS XM 5.0 emulated IBM PC DOS 2.10,<ref name=\"1986_CDOSXM\"/> whereas Concurrent DOS XM 6.0 and Concurrent DOS 386 2.0 were compatible with IBM PC DOS 3.30.<ref name=\"DRI_1988_CDOS\"/>\n\n===={{anchor|CCI-CDOS}}Adaptations====\nKnown CCI Concurrent DOS adaptations by Concurrent Controls, Inc. include:\n\n* CCI Concurrent DOS 386 1.12 (BDOS 5.0?, 1987-10)\n* CCI Concurrent DOS 386 2.01 (BDOS 6.0?, 1988-05)\n* CCI Concurrent DOS 386 3.01 (BDOS 6.2?, 1989-03)\n* CCI Concurrent DOS 386 3.02 (1990-04)\n* CCI Concurrent DOS 386 3.03 (1991-03)\n* CCI Concurrent DOS 386 3.04 (1991-07)<ref name=\"Scannell_1991_Scripting\"/> aka \"CCI Concurrent DOS 4.0\"<ref name=\"Scannell_1991_Concurrent\"/>\n* CCI Concurrent DOS 3.05 R1 (1992-02), R2 (1992), R3+R4 (1992), R5+R6 (1992), R7+R8 (1993), R9+R10 (1993), R11 (1993-08)\n* CCI Concurrent DOS 3.06 R1 (1993-12), R2+R3 (1994), R4+R5+R6 (1994), R7 (1994-07)\n* CCI Concurrent DOS 3.07 R1 (1995-03), R2 (1995), R3 (1996), R4 (1996), R5 (1997), R6 (1997), R7 (1998-06)<ref name=\"CCI_1998_CDOS\"/>\n* CCI Concurrent DOS 3.08\n<!-- * CCI Concurrent DOS 3.09 to be enabled when a RS is found that it existed -->\n* CCI Concurrent DOS 3.10 R1 (2003-10-05)<ref name=\"CCI_2003_CDOS310R1\"/>\n\nOther adaptations include:\n\n* [[Apricot]] Concurrent DOS 386 2.01 (1987) for Apricot Quad Version Level 4.3<ref name=\"Apricot_CDOS\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|MDOS|5.0|5.1}}Multiuser DOS==\n<!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article.

MDOS), starting with version 5.0 (with BDOS 6.5) in 1991.<ref name=\"Scannell_1991_Tools\"/>\n\nMultiuser DOS suffered from several technical limitations that restricted its ability to compete with [[local area network|LANs]] based on [[PC DOS]]. It required its own special [[device driver]]s for much common hardware, as PC DOS drivers were not multiuser or multi-tasking aware. Driver installation was more complex than the simple PC DOS method of copying the files onto the boot disk and modifying CONFIG.SYS appropriately{{snd}} it was necessary to relink the Multiuser DOS [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]] (known as a ''nucleus'') using the [[SYSGEN]] command.\n\nMultiuser DOS was also unable to use many common PC DOS additions such as [[network stack]]s, and it was limited in its ability to support later developments in the PC-compatible world, such as [[graphics adaptor]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[CD-ROM]] drives and mice. Although many of these were soon rectified{{snd}} for example, graphical terminals were developed, allowing users to use [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] and [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] software{{snd}} it was less flexible in this regard than a network of individual PCs, and as the prices of these fell, it became less and less competitive, although it still offered benefits in terms of management and lower total cost of ownership. As a multi-user operating system its price was higher than a single-user system, of course, and it required special device drivers, unlike single-user multitasking DOS add-ons such as [[Quarterdeck Office Systems|Quarterdeck's]] [[DESQview]]. Unlike MP/M, it never became popular for single-user but multitasking use.\n\nWhen Novell acquired Digital Research in 1991<ref name=\"Scott_1991\"/><ref name=\"BW_1991\"/><ref name=\"Allchin_1992\"/> and abandoned Multiuser DOS in 1992, the three Master VARs DataPac Australasia, Concurrent Controls<ref name=\"Barney_1994_CCI\"/> and Intelligent Micro Software<ref name=\"Pontin_1995_IMS\"/> were allowed to license the source code of the system to take over and continue independent development of their derivations in 1994.\n\nKnown versions include:\n\n* DR Multiuser DOS 5.00 (1991),<ref name=\"CW_1991_DRMDOS50\"/> 5.01\n* Novell DR Multiuser DOS 5.10 (1992-04-13),<ref name=\"CW_MDOS51\"/> 5.11<ref name=\"CCI_FPROD\"/>\n* Novell DR Multiuser DOS 5.13 (BDOS 6.6<!-- 1466 -->, 1992)\n\nAll versions of Digital Research and Novell DR Multiuser DOS reported themselves as \"IBM PC DOS\" version 3.31.\n\n===Adaptations===\n===={{anchor|Datapac|System Manager}}DataPac Australasia====\n<!-- This section may be linked to from inside or outside this article.

It used [[pre-emptive multitasking]], preventing badly-written applications from delaying other processes by retaining control of the processor. To this day, Multiuser DOS is supported by popular [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] libraries such as [[wolfSSL]]. \n\nThe [[API]] provided support for blocking and non-blocking [[message queue]]s, mutual-exclusion queues, the ability to create sub-process [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] which executed independently from the parent, and a method of pausing execution which did not waste processor cycles, unlike idle loops used by single-user operating systems. Applications were started as \"attached\" to a [[virtual console|console]]. However, if an application did not need user interaction it could \"detach\" from the console and run as a [[background process]], later reattaching to a console if needed.\n\nAnother key feature was that the [[memory management]] supported a \"shared\" [[Memory model (computing)|memory model]] for processes (in addition to the usual models available to normal DOS programs). In the shared memory model the \"code\" and \"data\" sections of a program were isolated from each other. Because the \"code\" contained no modifiable data, code sections in memory could be shared by several processes running the same program, thereby reducing memory requirements.\n\nPrograms written, or adapted, for any [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] platform need to avoid the technique used by single-tasking systems of going into endless loops until interrupted when, for example, waiting for a user to press a key; this wasted processor time that could be used by other processes. Instead, Concurrent DOS provided an API call which a process could call to \"sleep\" for a period of time. Later versions of the Concurrent DOS kernel included Idle Detection, which monitored [[DOS API]] calls to determine whether the application was doing useful work or in fact idle, in which case the process was suspended allowing other processes to run. Idle Detection was the catalyst for the patented [[DR-DOS]] [[Dynamic Idle Detection]] power management feature invented in 1989 by Roger Alan Gross and John P. Constant and marketed as [[BatteryMAX]].<ref name=\"US5355501\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[CP/M]]\n* [[MP/M]]\n* [[Concurrent DOS V60]]\n* [[FlexOS]]\n* [[DR&nbsp;DOS]]\n* [[PC DOS]] \u2013 IBM's OEM version of (single-user) MS-DOS\n* [[MS-DOS 4.0 (multitasking)]]\n* [[PC-MOS/386]] \u2013 unrelated multitasking DOS clone\n* [[VM/386]] \u2013 unrelated multitasking DOS environment\n* [[Virtual DOS machine]]\n* [[Multiuser DOS Federation]]\n* [[Timeline of operating systems]]\n* [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Citrix]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"RM_1996_754\">{{cite web |author-first=R. |author-last=M. |title=REAL/32 Upgrade Disk - Version 7.54 - Batch 08-96-01 - SRN0167.WP |id=R32UP754.ZIP |date=1996-07-31 |url=http://contents.driverguide.com/content.php?id=582964&path=SRN0167.TXT |access-date=2017-01-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826200229/https://contents.driverguide.com/content.php?id=582964&path=SRN0167.TXT |archive-date=2018-08-26}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"DRI_1984_CCPM31\">Digital Research (1984): ''Concurrent CP/M ships early in response to team effort''.

This chameleon operating system allows ICL and other [[Intel 80286|80286]] manufacturers to build machines that will be able to cope with all the existing body of IBM-PC software -- and at the same time promise multi-tasking, windowing and true concurrency, three features that together allow a single micro to do several things at once.

But by this time it will have to contend with [[IBM]]'s own 80286 office micro, the PC/AT. [\u2026] IBM also have a software product in the offing that could pull the rug out from under the Concurrent contenders. Some 180K in size, [[TopView]] is a program for IBM PC's and AT's that beefs up the operating system to provide windowing facilities for existing 'well behaved' standard packages.
