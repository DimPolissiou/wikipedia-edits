Originally running at 6:57, the track was cut for a 7\" single release, but the full version was issued on 12\" vinyl \u2013 the first Bowie single to have a regular 12\" release in the UK. For the B-side, the original version of \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" was remixed.  After the relative disappointment of the singles from ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' on the charts, the single gave Bowie some greater degree of mainstream exposure during a period when his work was increasingly being perceived as esoteric and experimental.  The long 12\" version was included as a bonus track on the 1991 Rykodisk/EMI remaster CD of ''[[Young Americans]]'', on the 2007 collectors edition of the album, and on ''[[The Best of David Bowie 1974/1979]]''. The 7\" single version was not released on CD until 2016's ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]''.\n\nThe reworking of \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" drops the original verses, only leaving the chorus' lyrics intact, perhaps because of the supposed homosexual nature of the original piece. The new lyrics were simply an embrace of the dance floor and the spirit of disco. The chorus is delivered more slowly and unswung with dance beats instead of the rather retro blues beats of the original, giving time for Bowie to demonstrate vocal virtuosity. The changes were considered somewhat strange given the original's context, especially the transformation into the \"overlong\" dance track, given the 12\" version's extended mix, in which half of the song is a repetitive riff consisting of the lyrics \"dancing, dancing, dancing, woo woo woo-oo\".\n\n===Track listings===\n* All tracks by Bowie\n\n;7\" (BOW 4-UK)\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)\" \u2013 3:26\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (1972)\" \u2013 2:43\n\n;7\" (11887-US)\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (1972)\" \u2013 2:43\n# \"Joe The Lion\" \u2013 3:05\n\n;12\" (11886-US)\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)\" \u2013 6:59\n# \"Golden Years\" \u2013 4:03\n\n;12\" (BOW 12 4-UK)\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)\" \u2013 6:59\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (1972)\" \u2013 2:43\n\nThere were two entirely distinct singles in the US.

The new lyrics were simply an embrace of the dance floor and the spirit of disco. The chorus is delivered more slowly and unswung with dance beats instead of the rather retro blues beats of the original, giving time for Bowie to demonstrate vocal virtuosity. The changes were considered somewhat strange given the original's context, especially the transformation into the \"overlong\" dance track, given the 12\" version's extended mix, in which half of the song is a repetitive riff consisting of the lyrics \"dancing, dancing, dancing, woo woo woo-oo\".\n\n===Track listings===\n* All tracks by Bowie\n\n;7\" (BOW 4-UK)\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)\" \u2013 3:26\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (1972)\" \u2013 2:43\n\n;7\" (11887-US)\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (1972)\" \u2013 2:43\n# \"Joe The Lion\" \u2013 3:05\n\n;12\" (11886-US)\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)\" \u2013 6:59\n# \"Golden Years\" \u2013 4:03\n\n;12\" (BOW 12 4-UK)\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)\" \u2013 6:59\n# \"John, I'm Only Dancing (1972)\" \u2013 2:43\n\nThere were two entirely distinct singles in the US. One had \"John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)\", with \"[[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]\" as the B-side.  The other omitted \"John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)\", instead featuring the new remix of the 1972 version of the song, with \"[[Joe the Lion]]\" as the B-side.\n\n===Personnel===\n* '''Producers''':\n** [[Tony Visconti]]\n* '''Musicians''':\n** [[David Bowie]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals, acoustic rhythm guitar, piano\n** [[Carlos Alomar]] \u2013 lead guitar\n** [[Willie Weeks]] \u2013 bass\n** [[Andy Newmark]] \u2013 drums\n** [[Mike Garson]] \u2013 piano\n** [[David Sanborn]] \u2013 [[saxophone]]\n** Larry Washington \u2013 [[conga]]\n** [[Luther Vandross]], [[Robin Clark]], [[Ava Cherry]] \u2013 backing vocals\n\n===Other releases===\n* The 12\" version appeared on the following compilations:\n** ''[[Changestwobowie]]'' (1981)\n** ''[[The Best of David Bowie 1974/1979]]'' (1998)\n* Additionally, the 12\" version was a bonus track on the [[Rykodisc]] CD release of ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]'' in 1991, and appeared on the ''Collectors Edition'' of that album in 2007.\n* The 7\" single version was released on a vinyl LP, ''[[Rare (David Bowie album)|Rare]]'', in 1982, but was not released on CD until 2016's ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

Palmer (politician)|John Palmer]] placed 30 members of the Shelby County Home Guard and its captain Edwin Terrell on the federal payroll on April 1, 1865. The men roamed Shelby and its surrounding counties, persecuting Confederate guerrillas and Southern sympathizers. The Shelbyville trustees aimed to encourage them to stay close to the city, though, paying their hotel bills when they were in town. On May 10, Terrell and his men found Quantrill's raiders at a barn outside [[Wakefield, Kentucky|Wakefield]] in [[Spencer County, Kentucky|Spencer Co]]. and fatally shot their leader. The city came out to cheer the men upon their return and the trustees continued paying their room and board for another month after the U.S. Army paid off and disbanded the troupe on May 26.<ref name=louse/> The threat of raiding over, the blockhouse was demolished by September. By that time, Capt. Terrell and his lieutenant Harry Thompson had murdered and robbed an Illinois stock merchant named William R. Johnson. Over the next year, the local jury could not return a verdict. Terrell was transferred to [[Taylorsville, Kentucky|Taylorsville]] to be tried for a separate shooting, but broke jail with two companions on May 26 and returned to Shelbyville to go drinking in its saloons. The town marshal George Caplinger organized a posse and took Terrell by surprise outside the Armstrong Hotel, shooting him in the spine, killing his relative John R. Baker, and fatally wounding bystander Merrett Redding. Taken to Louisville, Terrell avoided trial owing to the gravity of his wound and returned home to [[Harrisonville, Kentucky|Harrisonville]] in October. On the 23rd of that month, Harry Thompson broke jail as well and, according to local lore, [[Gone to Texas|fled to Texas]] and lived out his days as the successful farmer \"Henry T. Grazian\".

The men roamed Shelby and its surrounding counties, persecuting Confederate guerrillas and Southern sympathizers. The Shelbyville trustees aimed to encourage them to stay close to the city, though, paying their hotel bills when they were in town. On May 10, Terrell and his men found Quantrill's raiders at a barn outside [[Wakefield, Kentucky|Wakefield]] in [[Spencer County, Kentucky|Spencer Co]]. and fatally shot their leader. The city came out to cheer the men upon their return and the trustees continued paying their room and board for another month after the U.S. Army paid off and disbanded the troupe on May 26.<ref name=louse/> The threat of raiding over, the blockhouse was demolished by September. By that time, Capt. Terrell and his lieutenant Harry Thompson had murdered and robbed an Illinois stock merchant named William R. Johnson. Over the next year, the local jury could not return a verdict. Terrell was transferred to [[Taylorsville, Kentucky|Taylorsville]] to be tried for a separate shooting, but broke jail with two companions on May 26 and returned to Shelbyville to go drinking in its saloons. The town marshal George Caplinger organized a posse and took Terrell by surprise outside the Armstrong Hotel, shooting him in the spine, killing his relative John R. Baker, and fatally wounding bystander Merrett Redding. Taken to Louisville, Terrell avoided trial owing to the gravity of his wound and returned home to [[Harrisonville, Kentucky|Harrisonville]] in October. On the 23rd of that month, Harry Thompson broke jail as well and, according to local lore, [[Gone to Texas|fled to Texas]] and lived out his days as the successful farmer \"Henry T. Grazian\".

The city is often visited by railfans, and a railroad viewing park, constructed in 2013 (dedicated 14 November 2013) hosts many railfans every day in a purpose built viewing platform.  Fostoria was also the home for over a dozen glass factories during the end of the 19th century.  The glass factories were established in Fostoria because of the [[Petroleum industry in Ohio|discovery of natural gas]] in the area.  As the gas supply became depleted, many of the factories closed or moved\u2014including the [[Fostoria Glass Company]].  Fostoria's most famous citizen is [[Charles Foster (Ohio politician)|Charles Foster]] (son of the man who helped establish Fostoria), who became governor of Ohio.\n\nThe community grew substantially during the end of the 19th century, coinciding with the northwest Ohio gas boom.  Typical of [[Rust Belt]] cities, Fostoria peaked in size in 1970.
