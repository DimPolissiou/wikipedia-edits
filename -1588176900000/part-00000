The serial was created by [[Reg Watson]] for The [[Reg Grundy Organisation]] and originally produced by Ian Bradley (later Executive Producer). It ran on [[Network Ten]] with interior shots filmed from their Melbourne Studio's it was broadcast from 27 February 1979 until 11 December 1986. Prisoner was known as '''''Prisoner: Cell Block H''''' in the United States and UK, and as '''''Caged Women''''' in Canada, ''Kvinnof\u00e4ngelset'' in Sweden, ''Wiezniarki'' in Poland, and as ''Cellblok H'' in the Netherlands.\n==Series cast==\n[[Elspeth Ballantyne]], who played officer Meg Jackson (later Morris) was the only actress to appear in all 692 episodes.{{refn|group=nb|This fact discounts background, non-speaking characters; if such were included, Barbara Jungwirth would almost have lasted as long as Ballantyne, having appeared very regularly as background prisoner Lorna Young from the second episode to the last in 1986, but she was only credited in a few episodes where she had spoken lines.}} Prominent cast members included [[Val Lehman]] as \"Queen\" Bea Smith, [[Sheila Florance]] as Lizzie Birdsworth, [[Colette Mann]] as Doreen Anderson (later Burns), [[Betty Bobbitt]] as Judy Bryant, [[Anne Phelan]] as Myra Desmond, [[Carol Burns]] as Franky Doyle, (although she only appeared in the first 20 episodes was also popular) and [[Sigrid Thornton]] as Roslyn \"Ros\" Coulson. Officers Joan \"The Freak\" Ferguson, played by [[Maggie Kirkpatrick]] and Vera Bennett played by [[Fiona Spence]] also became prominent stars. Although the regular cast was dominated by an all-female cast, something that was groundbreaking at the time, male characters where represented by original character Doctor Greg Miller ([[Barry Quin]]) and in later series Deputy Governor Jim Fletcher ([[Gerard Maguire]]). Common of the time many actors/actresses returned numerous times in multiple roles, such as [[Ray Meagher]] (played Geoff Butler, Kurt Renner  and eventually Ernest Craven the Governor of neighbouring prison \"Blackmoor\"). Prominent actors also to have cameo roles in the series included: [[Pat Evison]], [[Justine Saunders]], [[Judy Nunn]] and [[Paula Duncan]]. Screenwriter [[Anne Lucas]] would also appear in the role of Faye Quinn.\n\n==List of ''Prisoner'' cast==\n\nThe following list includes actors who were regular credited cast members that appeared in 20 or more episodes of the series, starting with actress [[Carol Burns]] who decided to leave the series after 20 episodes as production changed from 1 hour to 2 hour per week broadcast.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
