In the technical challenge, they were given three hours to make four [[ciabatta]] loaves using Paul's recipe, with the advice from Paul that they should be patient. In the showstopper, the bakers were required to make a bread centrepiece in four hours. The centrepiece should be a filled-loaf that is spectacular and tasty, and would be judged on its appearance, design and crust, and should be well-baked on the inside.<small><nowiki/></small>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!Baker\n!Signature\n(12 [[Rye bread|Rye Bread]] [[Bread roll|Rolls]])\n!Technical\n(4 [[Ciabatta]]s)\n!Showstopper\n(Filled Centrepiece Loaf)\n|-\n| Chetna || Onion and [[Pine Nut]] Rolls || align=\"center\" |8th || Rolled and Filled Twin Loaf \n|-\n| Diana || Rustic Picnic Rolls || align=\"center\" |7th || Sharing Savoury Pinwheel\n|-\n| Iain || Cranberry and Walnut Rye Bread Rolls || align=\"center\" |9th || Moroccan Plaited with a [[Bessara]] Dip\n|- style=\"background:pink;\"\n| Jordan || Rye and [[Spelt]] Bread Rolls || align=\"center\" |10th || Strawberry Raspberry [[Cheesecake]] [[Brioche]]\n|-\n| Kate || Orange and [[Cardamom]] Rye Bread Knots || align=\"center\" |1st || [[Prosciutto]], Olive & [[Coriander]] Bread\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0\"\n| Luis || Opposites Attract Rolls || align=\"center\" |2nd || [[Rosc\u00f3n de Reyes]]\n|-\n| Martha || Date and Walnut Rye Rolls || align=\"center\" |3rd || Stuffed Sunflower Loaf\n|-\n| Nancy || Cider and Walnut Crusty Rolls || align=\"center\" |5th || '[[Full English]]' [[Stromboli (food)|Stromboli]]\n|-\n| Norman || Rye Bread Rolls || align=\"center\" |4th || Chicken and Roasted Vegetable Picnic Loaf\n|-\n| Richard || Rye and Cranberry Rolls || align=\"center\" |6th || [[Pesto]] Pinwheel\n|}\n\n=== Episode 4: Desserts ===\nFor the signature bake, the judges gave the bakers two hours to make eight self-saucing puddings, meaning the sauce should come from the bake itself. The bakers may choose to make either a [[Molten chocolate cake|fondant]] or a sponge which creates its own sauce at the bottom. In the technical, they had to bake Mary's own [[tiramisu]] cake recipe in two and a half hours.

When Iain found it, the ice cream had melted and, frustrated, he threw the sponge cake and melted ice cream in the dustbin. (It was later stated by producers that the dessert was only out for one minute.) Paul and Mary chastised him for this decision, explaining that they would rather have judged sample pieces of each baked Alaska component or even a melted final product than nothing at all, and his decision to present Paul and Mary with nothing to judge contributed to his elimination. Viewers of the show objected on Twitter, attacking Diana.<ref name=\"guardian-ian\" /> Iain spoke out against these online attacks,<ref name=\"guardian-ian\" /> and Diana claimed that the editing had distorted the truth, \"stitching [her] up\".

The tart should have a crispy base and silky custard. The technical challenge is set using one of Paul's recipes, and the bakers were required to make six mini pear pies, which are poached pears surrounded by rough [[puff pastry]], to be completed in two hours. In the showstopper, the bakers were tasked with making tiered pies in four and half hours. The pies needed to be able to support themselves, and should have at least three tiers and share a common theme.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! Baker\n!

The bakers were given three hours for the challenge. The technical challenge was set using one of Mary's recipes for a Swedish [[Princess cake]] (''Prinsesst\u00e5rta''). The recipe is the most complicated yet, requiring 26 separate ingredients with 14 stages, and to be completed in two and a quarter hours. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to make a contemporary version of the Hungarian [[Dobos torte|Dobos Torte]] in five hours. The cake should have at least two tiers, with particular emphasis on caramel sugar work on the cake.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! Baker\n!

As Diana left the show before the previous week's contest due to illness, it was possible not to eliminate anyone.\n\n=== Episode 7: Pastry ===\n\nIn their first task, the bakers were set the challenge of making twelve savoury pastry parcels, to be completed in an hour and three quarters. The parcels can be of any type of pastries, but should be uniform in size, well-filled, perfectly cooked and well-sealed to prevent leaks. The technical bake was one that for the first time none of the bakers had heard of, the [[Breton people|Breton]] pastry [[kouign-amann]], using one of Paul's recipes. The bakers should make twelve identical kouign-amanns in three and a half hours. For the final challenge, the bakers were required to make 24 [[\u00c9clair]]s of two different flavours (12 of each) in four hours.

They had two and a half hours for the bake which is challenging as the bakers were required to use enriched dough which takes longer to [[Proofing (baking technique)|proof]]. In the technical, they had two and a half hours to make a [[povitica]], which Chetna had made for her signature loaf. This technical challenge was particularly hard for most of the bakers, many of whose loafs were raw inside and deemed unsafe to eat. [[Doughnuts]] were set as the challenge in the final task, and the bakers were required to make eighteen each of two different sorts, to be completed in four hours.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!

There had to be two different types of baklava, and twenty-four portions in total. For the technical challenge, the bakers had to make a [[Baumkuchen#Schichttorte|schichttorte]], and had two hours to complete it. There had to be twenty layers in their schichttorte, and was one of Paul's recipes. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers had to make [[entremets]], very small and fine cakes put in a window of a French [[p\u00e2tisserie]].

They had to make two different types of the pastry. In the technical, the judges decided to bring things \"back to basics\" by asking the bakers to bake 12 [[Victoria Sandwich]]es, [[Tarte au Citron|Tartes au citron]] and [[Scone]]s. The challenge, however, was that they had only two hours to make this and only three instructions. The final Showstopper was a [[Pi\u00e8ce mont\u00e9e|Pi\u00e8ce Mont\u00e9e]].

During the final showstopper round contestants were tasked with producing a baked Alaska. Iain's ice cream was shown as having not set, and in a show of frustration he threw his bake in the bin. The editing of the show suggested that another contestant, Diana Beard, had caused the failure by removing the ice cream from a freezer for her own ice cream, and the perceived \"sabotage\" resulted in a furore on social media networks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-great-british-bake-off-rocked-by-baked-alaska-sabotage-scandal-9695831.html |title=Great British Bake Off rocked by Baked Alaska 'sabotage' scandal |publisher=The Independent |date=28 August 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref> More than 800 complaints were lodged with the BBC, and some complained to the communication watchdog [[Ofcom]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/29/great-british-bake-off-ofcom-complaints-bbc-diana-beard-iain-watters |title=Great British Bake Off: Ofcom rules out investigation despite complaints |author=Jason Deans |date=29 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref> Some members of the cast however posted comments in support of Diana,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-paul-hollywood-sue-perkins-bingate-iain-watters |title=Great British Bake Off: Paul Hollywood and Sue Perkins speak out on 'bingate' |publisher=guardian.com |date=28 August 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref> and a BBC spokesman later issued a statement:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/08/28/great-british-bake-off-2014-bbc-receives-over-500-bingate-complaints-while-justiceforiain-dominates-twitter-4849049/ |title=Great British Bake Off 2014: BBC receives over 500 'bingate' complaints while #justiceforiain dominates Twitter |publisher=metro.co.uk |date=28 August 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref> \n\n''\"As shown in the episode, Iain became the fourth baker to leave the tent because he didn't present Paul and Mary with anything to judge in the showstopper challenge and both judges were very clear about the reasoning behind the decision. Due to the extreme temperature in the tent that day, many of the bakers struggled to get their ice cream to set as seen in the episode. Diana removing Iain's ice cream from the freezer for less than a minute was in no way responsible for Iain's departure.''\n\nThe claim that his dish was only left out for a short time however was challenged by Iain Watters, saying that it was left long enough to ruin the dessert.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-ian-watters-speaks-diana-beard |title=Great British Bake Off: Iain Watters speaks out as Diana Beard quits |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref> Fellow contestant Jordan Cox criticized the show's production, claiming the freezers were not very good in quality, and were chosen on aesthetic quality only.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s215/great-british-bake-off/news/a593577/jordan-cox-criticises-in-your-face-great-british-bake-off-team.html|title=Jordan Cox criticises \"in your face\" Great British Bake Off team|author = Ryan Love |date=31 August 2014  |work = Digital Spy}}</ref> Diana Beard left the show before the next episode was filmed due to illness.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-08-28/diana-quits-the-great-british-bake-off-2014 |title=Diana quits The Great British Bake Off 2014 |author=Susanna Lazarus|date= 28 August 2014 |work=Radio Times }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/diana-beard-quit-bake-off-smell-taste |title=Diana Beard: I quit Bake Off after losing sense of taste and smell |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nBeard later gave an interview to [[BBC Radio Shropshire]], saying: \"I'm disappointed with the way it's been portrayed.

When Iain found it, the ice cream had melted and, frustrated, he threw the sponge cake and melted ice cream in the dustbin. (It was later stated by producers that the dessert was only out for one minute.) Paul and Mary chastised him for this decision, explaining that they would rather have judged sample pieces of each baked Alaska component or even a melted final product than nothing at all, and his decision to present Paul and Mary with nothing to judge contributed to his elimination. Viewers of the show objected on Twitter, attacking Diana.<ref name=\"guardian-ian\" /> Iain spoke out against these online attacks,<ref name=\"guardian-ian\" /> and Diana claimed that the editing had distorted the truth, \"stitching [her] up\".

The tart should have a crispy base and silky custard. The technical challenge is set using one of Paul's recipes, and the bakers were required to make six mini pear pies, which are poached pears surrounded by rough [[puff pastry]], to be completed in two hours. In the showstopper, the bakers were tasked with making tiered pies in four and half hours.

The bakers were given three hours for the challenge. The technical challenge was set using one of Mary's recipes for a Swedish [[Princess cake]] (''Prinsesst\u00e5rta''). The recipe is the most complicated yet, requiring 26 separate ingredients with 14 stages, and to be completed in two and a quarter hours. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to make a contemporary version of the Hungarian [[Dobos torte|Dobos Torte]] in five hours. The cake should have at least two tiers, with particular emphasis on caramel sugar work on the cake.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! Baker\n!

As Diana left the show before the previous week's contest due to illness, it was possible not to eliminate anyone.\n\n=== Episode 7: Pastry ===\n\nIn their first task, the bakers were set the challenge of making twelve savoury pastry parcels, to be completed in an hour and three quarters. The parcels can be of any type of pastries, but should be uniform in size, well-filled, perfectly cooked and well-sealed to prevent leaks. The technical bake was one that for the first time none of the bakers had heard of, the [[Breton people|Breton]] pastry [[kouign-amann]], using one of Paul's recipes. The bakers should make twelve identical kouign-amanns in three and a half hours. For the final challenge, the bakers were required to make 24 [[\u00c9clair]]s of two different flavours (12 of each) in four hours. The \u00e9clairs should be made of [[choux pastry]] and \u00e9clair-shaped, otherwise the bakers were free to do as they wished to produce a showstopper.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!

They had two and a half hours for the bake which is challenging as the bakers were required to use enriched dough which takes longer to [[Proofing (baking technique)|proof]]. In the technical, they had two and a half hours to make a [[povitica]], which Chetna had made for her signature loaf. This technical challenge was particularly hard for most of the bakers, many of whose loafs were raw inside and deemed unsafe to eat. [[Doughnuts]] were set as the challenge in the final task, and the bakers were required to make eighteen each of two different sorts, to be completed in four hours.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!

There had to be two different types of baklava, and twenty-four portions in total. For the technical challenge, the bakers had to make a [[Baumkuchen#Schichttorte|schichttorte]], and had two hours to complete it. There had to be twenty layers in their schichttorte, and was one of Paul's recipes. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers had to make [[entremets]], very small and fine cakes put in a window of a French [[p\u00e2tisserie]]. They had to make two different types of entremets, twelve of each, and had five hours to complete the challenge. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! Baker \n!

They had to make two different types of the pastry. In the technical, the judges decided to bring things \"back to basics\" by asking the bakers to bake 12 [[Victoria Sandwich]]es, [[Tarte au Citron|Tartes au citron]] and [[Scone]]s. The challenge, however, was that they had only two hours to make this and only three instructions. The final Showstopper was a [[Pi\u00e8ce mont\u00e9e|Pi\u00e8ce Mont\u00e9e]]. The bakers were given five hours to make this, and the judges said it must be in some self-standing structure. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! Baker\n!

During the final showstopper round contestants were tasked with producing a baked Alaska. Iain's ice cream was shown as having not set, and in a show of frustration he threw his bake in the bin. The editing of the show suggested that another contestant, Diana Beard, had caused the failure by removing the ice cream from a freezer for her own ice cream, and the perceived \"sabotage\" resulted in a furore on social media networks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-great-british-bake-off-rocked-by-baked-alaska-sabotage-scandal-9695831.html |title=Great British Bake Off rocked by Baked Alaska 'sabotage' scandal |publisher=The Independent |date=28 August 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref> More than 800 complaints were lodged with the BBC, and some complained to the communication watchdog [[Ofcom]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/29/great-british-bake-off-ofcom-complaints-bbc-diana-beard-iain-watters |title=Great British Bake Off: Ofcom rules out investigation despite complaints |author=Jason Deans |date=29 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref> Some members of the cast however posted comments in support of Diana,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-paul-hollywood-sue-perkins-bingate-iain-watters |title=Great British Bake Off: Paul Hollywood and Sue Perkins speak out on 'bingate' |publisher=guardian.com |date=28 August 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref> and a BBC spokesman later issued a statement:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/08/28/great-british-bake-off-2014-bbc-receives-over-500-bingate-complaints-while-justiceforiain-dominates-twitter-4849049/ |title=Great British Bake Off 2014: BBC receives over 500 'bingate' complaints while #justiceforiain dominates Twitter |publisher=metro.co.uk |date=28 August 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref> \n\n''\"As shown in the episode, Iain became the fourth baker to leave the tent because he didn't present Paul and Mary with anything to judge in the showstopper challenge and both judges were very clear about the reasoning behind the decision. Due to the extreme temperature in the tent that day, many of the bakers struggled to get their ice cream to set as seen in the episode. Diana removing Iain's ice cream from the freezer for less than a minute was in no way responsible for Iain's departure.''\n\nThe claim that his dish was only left out for a short time however was challenged by Iain Watters, saying that it was left long enough to ruin the dessert.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-ian-watters-speaks-diana-beard |title=Great British Bake Off: Iain Watters speaks out as Diana Beard quits |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref> Fellow contestant Jordan Cox criticized the show's production, claiming the freezers were not very good in quality, and were chosen on aesthetic quality only.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s215/great-british-bake-off/news/a593577/jordan-cox-criticises-in-your-face-great-british-bake-off-team.html|title=Jordan Cox criticises \"in your face\" Great British Bake Off team|author = Ryan Love |date=31 August 2014  |work = Digital Spy}}</ref> Diana Beard left the show before the next episode was filmed due to illness.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-08-28/diana-quits-the-great-british-bake-off-2014 |title=Diana quits The Great British Bake Off 2014 |author=Susanna Lazarus|date= 28 August 2014 |work=Radio Times }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/diana-beard-quit-bake-off-smell-taste |title=Diana Beard: I quit Bake Off after losing sense of taste and smell |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nBeard later gave an interview to [[BBC Radio Shropshire]], saying: \"I'm disappointed with the way it's been portrayed.

According to Clemmont E. Vontress, the various religious traditions of Africa are united by a basic Animism. According to him, the belief in spirits and ancestors is the most important element of African religions. Gods were either self-created or evolved from spirits or ancestors which got worshiped by the people. He also notes that most modern African folk religions were strongly influenced by non-African religions, mostly Christianity and Islam and thus may differ from the ancient forms.<ref>{{Citation|last=Vontress|first=Clemmont E.|title=Animism: Foundation of Traditional Healing in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2005|url=https://sk.sagepub.com/books/integrating-traditional-healing-practices-into-counseling-and-psychotherapy/n11.xml|work=Integrating Traditional Healing Practices into Counseling and Psychotherapy|pages=124\u2013137|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|access-date=2019-10-31|doi=10.4135/9781452231648|isbn=9780761930471}}</ref>\n\n\n==Ceremonies==\nWest and Central African religious practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in which members of the community, overcome by ''force'' (or ''ashe'', ''nyama'', etc.), are excited to the point of going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or driving drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in [[Gabon]] and [[Cameroon]] is the [[Okuyi]], practiced by several [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness.<ref name=\"Karade, B. pages 39-46\">Karade, B. ''The Handbook of Yoruba Religious Concepts'', pages&nbsp;39\u201346. Samuel Weiser Inc, 1994</ref> \n\nWhen this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, adherents are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally appropriate behavior, thought, and speech.  Also, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.<ref>Annemarie De Waal Malefijt (1968) ''Religion and Culture: an Introduction to Anthropology of Religion'', p.&nbsp;220\u2013249, Macmillan</ref>\n\n==Spirits==\n{{Main|List of African mythological figures}}\nFollowers of traditional African religions pray to various spirits as well as to their ancestors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/10/the-spirituality-of-africa/|title=The spirituality of Africa|date=2015-10-06|website=Harvard Gazette|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> This includes also nature, elementary and animal spirits.

According to Gottlieb and Mbiti: <blockquote>The environment and nature are infused in every aspect of traditional African religions and culture. This is largely because cosmology and beliefs are intricately intertwined with the natural phenomena and environment. All aspects of weather, thunder, lightning, rain, day, moon, sun, stars, and so on may become amenable to control through the cosmology of African people. Natural phenomena are responsible for providing people with their daily needs.<ref>Roger S.

There are generally no prohibitions against the practice. Diviner (also known as priest) are also sought for their wisdom as counselors in life and for their knowledge of herbal medicine.\n\n==Virtue and vice==\nVirtue in traditional African religion is often connected with carrying out obligations of the communal aspect of life. Examples include social behaviors such as the respect for parents and elders, raising children appropriately, providing hospitality, and being honest, trustworthy, and courageous.\n\nIn some traditional African religions, morality is associated with obedience or disobedience to God regarding the way a person or a community lives. For the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], according to their primary supreme [[Creator deity|creator]], [[Ngai]], acting through the lesser deities, is believed to speak to and be capable of guiding the virtuous person as one's conscience.\n\nIn many cases, Africans who have converted to other religions have still kept up their traditional customs and practices, combining them in a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] way.<ref>''Resolving the Prevailing Conflicts Between Christianity and African (Igbo) Traditional Religion Through Inculturation'', by Edwin Anaegboka Udoye</ref>\n\n==Sacred places==\nSome sacred or holy locations for traditional religions include [[Nri-Igbo]], the [[Point of Sangomar]], [[Yaboyabo]], [[Fatick]], [[Ife]], [[Oyo, Nigeria|Oyo]], [[Dahomey]], [[Benin City]], [[Ouidah]], [[Nsukka]], [[Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], [[Igbo-Ukwu]], and Tulwap Kipsigis, among others.\n\n==Religious persecution==\n{{Main|Persecution of traditional African religion}}\n\n==Traditions by region==\nThis list is limited to a few well-known traditions.\n\n===Central Africa===\n*[[Bantu mythology]] (Central, Southeast, Southern Africa)\n**[[Bushongo mythology]] (Congo)\n**[[Lugbara mythology]] (Congo)\n** [[Baluba mythology]] (Congo)\n**[[Mbuti mythology]] (Congo)\n*[[Dinka religion]] (South Sudan)\n*[[Hausa animism]] ([[Chad]], [[Gabon]])\n*[[Lotuko mythology]] (South Sudan)\n\n===East Africa===\n*[[Bantu mythology]] (Central, Southeast, Southern Africa)\n**[[Gikuyu people#Culture and beliefs]] (Kenya)\n**[[Kamba people#Culture and beliefs|Akamba mythology]] (Kenya)\n*[[Maasai mythology]] (Kenya, Tanzania, Ouebian)\n*[[Kalenjin mythology]] (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania)\n*[[Dini Ya Msambwa]] (Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Kenya)\n\n===Horn of Africa===\n*[[Waaqeffanna]] (Ethiopia)\n*[[Waaqism]] (Ethiopian-Somali Region)\n\n===Southern Africa===\n*[[Bantu mythology]] (Central, Southeast, Southern Africa)\n**[[Lozi mythology]] (Zambia)\n**[[Tumbuka mythology]] (Malawi)\n**Xhosa mythology (Southern Africa)\n**[[Zulu mythology]] (South Africa)\n*[[San religion]] (South Africa)\n*[[Traditional healers of South Africa]]\n*Manjonjo Healers of Chitungwiza of Zimbabwe\n\n===West Africa===\n*[[Akan religion]] (Ghana, Ivory Coast)\n*[[Dahomean religion]] (Benin, Togo)\n*[[Efik mythology]] (Nigeria, Cameroon)\n*Edo religion (Benin kingdom, Nigeria)\n*[[Hausa animism]] (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, Togo)\n*[[Odinani]] ([[Igbo people]], [[Nigeria]])\n*[[Serer religion|Serer religion (A \u01adat Roog)]] (Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania)\n*[[Yoruba religion]] (Nigeria, Benin, Togo)\n*[[West African Vodun]] (Ghana, Benin, Togo, Nigeria)\n*[[Dogon religion]] (Mali)\n\n=== African Diaspora ===\n{{Main|Afro-American religion}}\n\n===North Africa===\n*[[Ancient Egyptian religion]] (Egypt, Sudan)\n**[[Kemetism]]\n*[[Traditional Berber religion]] (Morocco (including Western Sahara), Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso)\n*[[Hausa animism]] ([[Sudan]])\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Information presented here was gleaned from ''World Eras Encyclopaedia'', Volume 10, edited by Pierre-Damien Mvuyekure (New York: Thomson-Gale, 2003), in particular pp.&nbsp;275\u2013314.\n*Baldick, J (1997) ''Black God: The Afroasiatic Roots of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Religions''.

According to Clemmont E. Vontress, the various religious traditions of Africa are united by a basic Animism. According to him, the belief in spirits and ancestors is the most important element of African religions. Gods were either self-created or evolved from spirits or ancestors which got worshiped by the people. He also notes that most modern African folk religions were strongly influenced by non-African religions, mostly Christianity and Islam and thus may differ from the ancient forms.<ref>{{Citation|last=Vontress|first=Clemmont E.|title=Animism: Foundation of Traditional Healing in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2005|url=https://sk.sagepub.com/books/integrating-traditional-healing-practices-into-counseling-and-psychotherapy/n11.xml|work=Integrating Traditional Healing Practices into Counseling and Psychotherapy|pages=124\u2013137|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|access-date=2019-10-31|doi=10.4135/9781452231648|isbn=9780761930471}}</ref>\n\n\n==Ceremonies==\nWest and Central African religious practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in which members of the community, overcome by ''force'' (or ''ashe'', ''nyama'', etc.), are excited to the point of going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or driving drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in [[Gabon]] and [[Cameroon]] is the [[Okuyi]], practiced by several [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness.<ref name=\"Karade, B. pages 39-46\">Karade, B. ''The Handbook of Yoruba Religious Concepts'', pages&nbsp;39\u201346. Samuel Weiser Inc, 1994</ref> \n\nWhen this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, adherents are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally appropriate behavior, thought, and speech.  Also, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.<ref>Annemarie De Waal Malefijt (1968) ''Religion and Culture: an Introduction to Anthropology of Religion'', p.&nbsp;220\u2013249, Macmillan</ref>\n\n==Spirits==\n{{Main|List of African mythological figures}}\nFollowers of traditional African religions pray to various spirits as well as to their ancestors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/10/the-spirituality-of-africa/|title=The spirituality of Africa|date=2015-10-06|website=Harvard Gazette|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> This includes also nature, elementary and animal spirits.

According to Gottlieb and Mbiti: <blockquote>The environment and nature are infused in every aspect of traditional African religions and culture. This is largely because cosmology and beliefs are intricately intertwined with the natural phenomena and environment. All aspects of weather, thunder, lightning, rain, day, moon, sun, stars, and so on may become amenable to control through the cosmology of African people. Natural phenomena are responsible for providing people with their daily needs.<ref>Roger S.

There are generally no prohibitions against the practice. Diviner (also known as priest) are also sought for their wisdom as counselors in life and for their knowledge of herbal medicine.\n\n==Virtue and vice==\nVirtue in traditional African religion is often connected with carrying out obligations of the communal aspect of life. Examples include social behaviors such as the respect for parents and elders, raising children appropriately, providing hospitality, and being honest, trustworthy, and courageous.\n\nIn some traditional African religions, morality is associated with obedience or disobedience to God regarding the way a person or a community lives. For the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], according to their primary supreme [[Creator deity|creator]], [[Ngai]], acting through the lesser deities, is believed to speak to and be capable of guiding the virtuous person as one's conscience.\n\nIn many cases, Africans who have converted to other religions have still kept up their traditional customs and practices, combining them in a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] way.<ref>''Resolving the Prevailing Conflicts Between Christianity and African (Igbo) Traditional Religion Through Inculturation'', by Edwin Anaegboka Udoye</ref>\n\n==Sacred places==\nSome sacred or holy locations for traditional religions include [[Nri-Igbo]], the [[Point of Sangomar]], [[Yaboyabo]], [[Fatick]], [[Ife]], [[Oyo, Nigeria|Oyo]], [[Dahomey]], [[Benin City]], [[Ouidah]], [[Nsukka]], [[Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], [[Igbo-Ukwu]], and Tulwap Kipsigis, among others.\n\n==Religious persecution==\n{{Main|Persecution of traditional African religion}}\n\n==Traditions by region==\nThis list is limited to a few well-known traditions.\n\n===Central Africa===\n*[[Bantu mythology]] (Central, Southeast, Southern Africa)\n**[[Bushongo mythology]] (Congo)\n**[[Lugbara mythology]] (Congo)\n** [[Baluba mythology]] (Congo)\n**[[Mbuti mythology]] (Congo)\n*[[Dinka religion]] (South Sudan)\n*[[Hausa animism]] ([[Chad]], [[Gabon]])\n*[[Lotuko mythology]] (South Sudan)\n\n===East Africa===\n*[[Bantu mythology]] (Central, Southeast, Southern Africa)\n**[[Gikuyu people#Culture and beliefs]] (Kenya)\n**[[Kamba people#Culture and beliefs|Akamba mythology]] (Kenya)\n*[[Maasai mythology]] (Kenya, Tanzania, Ouebian)\n*[[Kalenjin mythology]] (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania)\n*[[Dini Ya Msambwa]] (Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Kenya)\n\n===Horn of Africa===\n*[[Waaqeffanna]] (Ethiopia)\n*[[Waaqism]] (Ethiopian-Somali Region)\n\n===Southern Africa===\n*[[Bantu mythology]] (Central, Southeast, Southern Africa)\n**[[Lozi mythology]] (Zambia)\n**[[Tumbuka mythology]] (Malawi)\n**Xhosa mythology (Southern Africa)\n**[[Zulu mythology]] (South Africa)\n*[[San religion]] (South Africa)\n*[[Traditional healers of South Africa]]\n*Manjonjo Healers of Chitungwiza of Zimbabwe\n\n===West Africa===\n*[[Akan religion]] (Ghana, Ivory Coast)\n*[[Dahomean religion]] (Benin, Togo)\n*[[Efik mythology]] (Nigeria, Cameroon)\n*Edo religion (Benin kingdom, Nigeria)\n*[[Hausa animism]] (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, Togo)\n*[[Odinani]] ([[Igbo people]], [[Nigeria]])\n*[[Serer religion|Serer religion (A \u01adat Roog)]] (Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania)\n*[[Yoruba religion]] (Nigeria, Benin, Togo)\n*[[West African Vodun]] (Ghana, Benin, Togo, Nigeria)\n*[[Dogon religion]] (Mali)\n\n=== African Diaspora ===\n{{Main|Afro-American religion}}\n\n===North Africa===\n*[[Ancient Egyptian religion]] (Egypt, Sudan)\n**[[Kemetism]]\n*[[Traditional Berber religion]] (Morocco (including Western Sahara), Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso)\n*[[Hausa animism]] ([[Sudan]])\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Information presented here was gleaned from ''World Eras Encyclopaedia'', Volume 10, edited by Pierre-Damien Mvuyekure (New York: Thomson-Gale, 2003), in particular pp.&nbsp;275\u2013314.\n*Baldick, J (1997) ''Black God: The Afroasiatic Roots of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Religions''.

They can carry two or three adults plus goods, a total load in excess of {{convert|250|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.  They are available only where land is flat and level.\n\nFor longer journeys, such as from the municipal centre to outlying barangays, then motor tricycles are available.  Smaller ones are motorcycle-[[sidecar]] combinations, and can carry about 4 passengers.  Larger ones, known as ''multis'', have some sort of saloon behind the driver, and are usually shared between as many as eight passengers, plus some goods stowage.\n\nFor the longest journeys, such as from Santa Fe ferry pier into downtown Bantayan and onwards, there are larger [[jeepney]]s, which can carry around 20 passengers with rooftop goods stowage.\n\nThere is no public bus service as such.\n\n==Heritage==\n\nThere are a few historically notable buildings but they have generally not been well maintained, and the ravages of the climate hasten decay, together with several major fires, which consume the wooden structures. Preventive maintenance generally was not practised, so even the best preserved buildings date back only to the middle of the 19th century.\n\n===Parish church of Sts Peter and Paul===\n\n[[File:Bantayan Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Cebu with the new belfry.jpg|thumb|left|Sts Peter & Paul front exterior with belfry]]\nThe main church stands on the principal plaza.  Since the arrival of the Spanish there have been several buildings on its site: originally it was little more than a bamboo and nipa structure, which was burned down during one of the [[Moro pirates|Moro raids]].  This was replaced by another wooden structure, which also burned down.  Construction of the present building (the fifth on the site) started in 1839.  The main driving force was the parish priest Padre Doroteo Andrade del Rosario and the ''maestro de obras'' (master of works) was his nephew Manuel Rubio y del Rosario (also known as ''{{visible anchor | Kapitan Tawi}}'').  Construction lasted about 24 years.  The principal building material is coral, sawn to approximately parallelepiped shape and dressed like stone.\n\nSince mid\u20132012 refurbishment work has been in progress: the belfry has been restored to its former glory, and {{As of | 2013 | 02 | alt = as at {{date|feb 2013}}}} there are plans to open it for tourist access.  The stairs are very steep and not very well guarded, however it does offer an elevated panoramic view of the waterfront.\n\nThe church also houses a small museum, visiting by appointment.\n\n===D.C. Abello theater===\n[[File:DC Abello movie theater.jpg|thumb|DC Abello movie theater]]\n{{quote|text=The D.C. Abello Theater was a Love Offering of Diego Abello and Candelaria Abello y Causing, parents of the Mayor Remedios Abello Escario.  Construction of the theater started in 1948 and was completed in 1952.  It took four years before the theater could be fully operation as they had to source out a suitable projector and a quality screen that showed images clearly.  Diego and Candelaria Abello built this theater to provide entertainment to the people of Bantayan.  The building's architectural style harks back to the American period.\n\nThe D.C. Abello Theater used to show double films and was the favorite rendezvous site of many young romantic Bantayanons at the time.  Bantayanons from the neighboring islets and island barangays would flock to this theater especially when a [[Fernando Poe Jr]] film was showing.  The theater was closed in the early 1980s with the advent of [[Betamax]] and, later the DVD era.\n| cite = [[:File:Description of DC Abello movie theater.jpg|Heritage building sign]]\n}}\n{{As of | 2013 | 02 | alt = As at {{date|feb 2013}}}} it is some sort of warehouse for glass and windows.\n\nThe building was entirely demolished in early 2015 to make way for the island's first supermarket development.\n\n===Houses===\n[[File:Bantayan heritage in ruins.jpg|thumb|Derelict once-grand homes on Bantayan island]]\nCentral plaza was the location of several well-built houses.  Opposite the church Manuel del Rosario built two which used to be \"the grandest homes on Bantayan island\".  Originally pre-dating the church, one was used as the ''Casa de Mamposteria'' (house of masons) during construction of the church.  The main house was later inherited by the son of del Rosario and his second wife, while the house next door was their wedding gift to their daughter.\n\nAfter subsequent bequests, ownership of both houses was shared by many scions of the Causing and Escario families.  They were unable to decide on (or maybe fund) {{sfn|Cebu Daily News|2007}}  any necessary preventive maintenance work.  {{As of | 2013 | 02 | alt = As at {{date|feb 2013}}}} both houses have more or less collapsed in ruins past repair.  All that remains of Bantayan's former glory is a dangerous and unsightly collection of rotten beams, collapsed walls and broken tiles occupying a prime and valuable location.  [[Typhoon Yolanda]] subsequently caused both ruins to collapse entirely.\n\n==Recreation==\n\nThere are no longer any public entertainment centres such as cinemas.  Apart from religious fiestas and processions, the main Bantayanon enjoyment comes from karaoke (known as [[videoke]]).  Many households have their own equipment, but for special occasions they hire equipment with truly prodigious output, especially with [[Infrasound|low frequency sound]].  This is likely to be placed in the street, for the enjoyment of all the neighbourhood.\n\n===Beach===\n[[File:Beach at Baig-dad, Bantayan, Cebu.JPG|thumb|left|Empty beach, empty sea at Baigad]]\nMuch of the municipality coastline is unsuitable as a beach - there is no real sandy area, mostly rocks or mud, all along the southern coast of the municipality, and the western coast almost as far north as Baod and Patao.  There are better beaches on the eastern coast, but access is difficult.\n\nSillon and Baigad is where good beaches can be found \u2013 wide expanses of sand, clean sea and few bathers.  However these too have plenty of detritus and [[flotsam]] \u2013 for the most part seaweed and vegetation from the coconut palms which line the shore.  The beaches are almost completely undeveloped, so no facilities, and there are several large private properties which are built close to the shore line.\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Attractions===\n[[File:Obo-ob mangrove garden.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Walkway to the Obo{{nbhyph}}ob Mangrove Garden]]\n\nPrivate facilities which are open to the public include:\n* Casa de Antiguedades{{sfn|The Freeman|2010}} \u2013 This is a private house whose owner is happy to show visitors some of the artefacts and objects he has collected over the years.  No entrance fee, but a contribution to upkeep is appreciated.\n*Obo{{nbhyph}}ob Mangrove Garden \u2013 established by the residents of brgy Obo{{nbhyph}}ob, the garden offers visitors a tour into the [[Mangrove|mangal]] forest along an elevated bamboo trail.\n*St Helena Botanical Garden shows off a selection of exotic flowers and fruits.\n*Bantayan Nature Park \u2013 {{as of|2012|alt=this recently established}} (2012) place does not (yet) live up to its name.\n\n===Cockfighting===\n\nAs is common throughout the Philippines, 'sport' is synonymous with [[cock-fighting]].  There is a large sports centre (cockpit) on the road to Santa Fe, which attracts a large clientele in Sundays.  In addition, [[purok]]s can have their own arena, usually just a piece of land set aside for the purpose.\n\n===Festivals and processions===\n\nThe [[Holy Week]] observance attracts large numbers of local and foreign tourists to the foot processions on [[Maundy Thursday]] and [[Good Friday]], when life-sized images and icons are mounted on ''carrozas'' (floats) decorated in a carnival style that depict various tableaux of Christ's Passion and the Stations of the Cross.\n\nPalawod is another festival held {{date|29 June}} in honour of Sts Peter & Paul.  The street dancing and ritual showdown competitions which depict the fishing traditions of Bantayan have contributed to Palawod's being the 3-times Grand Champion of the ''Pasigarbo sa Sugbo'' Festival of Festivals.\n\nSinulog takes place at the end of January, when there are ten or more days of noisy celebration.\n\n==Notable People==\n*[[Archbishop]] [[John F.

They can carry two or three adults plus goods, a total load in excess of {{convert|250|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.  They are available only where land is flat and level.\n\nFor longer journeys, such as from the municipal centre to outlying barangays, then motor tricycles are available.  Smaller ones are motorcycle-[[sidecar]] combinations, and can carry about 4 passengers.  Larger ones, known as ''multis'', have some sort of saloon behind the driver, and are usually shared between as many as eight passengers, plus some goods stowage.\n\nFor the longest journeys, such as from Santa Fe ferry pier into downtown Bantayan and onwards, there are larger [[jeepney]]s, which can carry around 20 passengers with rooftop goods stowage.\n\nThere is no public bus service as such.\n\n==Heritage==\n\nThere are a few historically notable buildings but they have generally not been well maintained, and the ravages of the climate hasten decay, together with several major fires, which consume the wooden structures. Preventive maintenance generally was not practised, so even the best preserved buildings date back only to the middle of the 19th century.\n\n===Parish church of Sts Peter and Paul===\n\n[[File:Bantayan Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Cebu with the new belfry.jpg|thumb|left|Sts Peter & Paul front exterior with belfry]]\nThe main church stands on the principal plaza.  Since the arrival of the Spanish there have been several buildings on its site: originally it was little more than a bamboo and nipa structure, which was burned down during one of the [[Moro pirates|Moro raids]].  This was replaced by another wooden structure, which also burned down.  Construction of the present building (the fifth on the site) started in 1839.  The main driving force was the parish priest Padre Doroteo Andrade del Rosario and the ''maestro de obras'' (master of works) was his nephew Manuel Rubio y del Rosario (also known as ''{{visible anchor | Kapitan Tawi}}'').  Construction lasted about 24 years.  The principal building material is coral, sawn to approximately parallelepiped shape and dressed like stone.\n\nSince mid\u20132012 refurbishment work has been in progress: the belfry has been restored to its former glory, and {{As of | 2013 | 02 | alt = as at {{date|feb 2013}}}} there are plans to open it for tourist access.  The stairs are very steep and not very well guarded, however it does offer an elevated panoramic view of the waterfront.\n\nThe church also houses a small museum, visiting by appointment.\n\n===D.C. Abello theater===\n[[File:DC Abello movie theater.jpg|thumb|DC Abello movie theater]]\n{{quote|text=The D.C. Abello Theater was a Love Offering of Diego Abello and Candelaria Abello y Causing, parents of the Mayor Remedios Abello Escario.  Construction of the theater started in 1948 and was completed in 1952.  It took four years before the theater could be fully operation as they had to source out a suitable projector and a quality screen that showed images clearly.  Diego and Candelaria Abello built this theater to provide entertainment to the people of Bantayan.  The building's architectural style harks back to the American period.\n\nThe D.C. Abello Theater used to show double films and was the favorite rendezvous site of many young romantic Bantayanons at the time.  Bantayanons from the neighboring islets and island barangays would flock to this theater especially when a [[Fernando Poe Jr]] film was showing.  The theater was closed in the early 1980s with the advent of [[Betamax]] and, later the DVD era.\n| cite = [[:File:Description of DC Abello movie theater.jpg|Heritage building sign]]\n}}\n{{As of | 2013 | 02 | alt = As at {{date|feb 2013}}}} it is some sort of warehouse for glass and windows.\n\nThe building was entirely demolished in early 2015 to make way for the island's first supermarket development.\n\n===Houses===\n[[File:Bantayan heritage in ruins.jpg|thumb|Derelict once-grand homes on Bantayan island]]\nCentral plaza was the location of several well-built houses.  Opposite the church Manuel del Rosario built two which used to be \"the grandest homes on Bantayan island\".  Originally pre-dating the church, one was used as the ''Casa de Mamposteria'' (house of masons) during construction of the church.  The main house was later inherited by the son of del Rosario and his second wife, while the house next door was their wedding gift to their daughter.\n\nAfter subsequent bequests, ownership of both houses was shared by many scions of the Causing and Escario families.  They were unable to decide on (or maybe fund) {{sfn|Cebu Daily News|2007}}  any necessary preventive maintenance work.  {{As of | 2013 | 02 | alt = As at {{date|feb 2013}}}} both houses have more or less collapsed in ruins past repair.  All that remains of Bantayan's former glory is a dangerous and unsightly collection of rotten beams, collapsed walls and broken tiles occupying a prime and valuable location.  [[Typhoon Yolanda]] subsequently caused both ruins to collapse entirely.\n{{clear}}\n==Recreation==\n\nThere are no longer any public entertainment centres such as cinemas.  Apart from religious fiestas and processions, the main Bantayanon enjoyment comes from karaoke (known as [[videoke]]).  Many households have their own equipment, but for special occasions they hire equipment with truly prodigious output, especially with [[Infrasound|low frequency sound]].  This is likely to be placed in the street, for the enjoyment of all the neighbourhood.\n\n===Beach===\n[[File:Beach at Baig-dad, Bantayan, Cebu.JPG|thumb|left|Empty beach, empty sea at Baigad]]\nMuch of the municipality coastline is unsuitable as a beach - there is no real sandy area, mostly rocks or mud, all along the southern coast of the municipality, and the western coast almost as far north as Baod and Patao.  There are better beaches on the eastern coast, but access is difficult.\n\nSillon and Baigad is where good beaches can be found \u2013 wide expanses of sand, clean sea and few bathers.  However these too have plenty of detritus and [[flotsam]] \u2013 for the most part seaweed and vegetation from the coconut palms which line the shore.  The beaches are almost completely undeveloped, so no facilities, and there are several large private properties which are built close to the shore line.\n{{clear left}}\n===Attractions===\n[[File:Obo-ob mangrove garden.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Walkway to the Obo{{nbhyph}}ob Mangrove Garden]]\n\nPrivate facilities which are open to the public include:\n* Casa de Antiguedades{{sfn|The Freeman|2010}} \u2013 This is a private house whose owner is happy to show visitors some of the artefacts and objects he has collected over the years.  No entrance fee, but a contribution to upkeep is appreciated.\n*Obo{{nbhyph}}ob Mangrove Garden \u2013 established by the residents of brgy Obo{{nbhyph}}ob, the garden offers visitors a tour into the [[Mangrove|mangal]] forest along an elevated bamboo trail.\n*St Helena Botanical Garden shows off a selection of exotic flowers and fruits.\n*Bantayan Nature Park \u2013 {{as of|2012|alt=this recently established}} (2012) place does not (yet) live up to its name.\n\n===Cockfighting===\n\nAs is common throughout the Philippines, 'sport' is synonymous with [[cock-fighting]].  There is a large sports centre (cockpit) on the road to Santa Fe, which attracts a large clientele in Sundays.  In addition, [[purok]]s can have their own arena, usually just a piece of land set aside for the purpose.\n\n===Festivals and processions===\n\nThe [[Holy Week]] observance attracts large numbers of local and foreign tourists to the foot processions on [[Maundy Thursday]] and [[Good Friday]], when life-sized images and icons are mounted on ''carrozas'' (floats) decorated in a carnival style that depict various tableaux of Christ's Passion and the Stations of the Cross.\n\nPalawod is another festival held {{date|29 June}} in honour of Sts Peter & Paul.  The street dancing and ritual showdown competitions which depict the fishing traditions of Bantayan have contributed to Palawod's being the 3-times Grand Champion of the ''Pasigarbo sa Sugbo'' Festival of Festivals.\n\nSinulog takes place at the end of January, when there are ten or more days of noisy celebration.\n\n==Notable People==\n*[[Archbishop]] [[John F.

It was released on November 23, 1993, by [[Death Row Records]] and [[Interscope Records]]. The album was recorded and produced following Snoop's appearances on [[Dr. Dre]]'s debut solo album ''[[The Chronic]]'' (1992), to which Snoop contributed significantly.

That album is considered to have \"transformed the entire sound of West Coast rap\" by its development of what later became known as the \"[[G-funk]]\" sound.<ref name=AMG-TheChronic>Steve Huey.

He was the [[List of Governors of New York|39th Governor of New York]] and a long-serving congressman from the same state. He was the first and so far only New York governor to be impeached. He broke with his sponsors at [[Tammany Hall]], and they produced convincing evidence that Sulzer had falsified his sworn statement of campaign expenditures.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date= August 14, 2017 |title=Here's why William Sulzer was the first \u2014 and still only \u2014 NY governor to be impeached |first= JOSEPH |last=MCNAMARA |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/william-sulzer-ny-governor-impeached-article-1.2872925}}</ref>\n\n==Personal==\nWilliam Sulzer was born in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], on March 18, 1863, the son of Thomas Sulzer, who was German born, and Mary Cooney of Ireland. He was the second in a family of eight children, and his siblings included [[Charles August Sulzer]], who pursued a successful political career in [[Alaska]]. He was reared on his family farm and attended the public schools of Elizabeth. At age 12 he left home and sailed as a [[cabin boy]] aboard a [[brig]], the ''William H. Thompson.'' He returned to the family home a year later and became a clerk in a grocery store.<ref name=NYTObituary/>\n\nSulzer took night classes at [[Cooper Union]] before attending lectures at [[Columbia Law School]] and [[reading law|studying law]] with the New York City firm of Parish & Pendleton.  He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1884, and commenced practice in [[New York City]]. Even before beginning his law practice, he was a member of [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]] serving as a popular stump speaker.<ref>Jacob Alexis Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' (1939), p. 16</ref><ref name=NYTObituary>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/11/07/104306444.pdf \"William Sulzer, Ex-Governor, 78,\" ''The New York Times,'' November 7, 1941]</ref>\n\nHe married Clara Rodelheim in 1908.\n\n==Career==\n\nSulzer's career in politics began in 1884 when he worked for the Tammany Hall political machine on New York's East Side as a stump speaker for various Democratic campaigns including the presidential campaign of then-Governor [[Grover Cleveland]]\n\nSulzer was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] in [[113th New York State Legislature|1890]], [[114th New York State Legislature|1891]], [[115th New York State Legislature|1892]] (all three New York Co., 14th D.), [[116th New York State Legislature|1893]] and [[117th New York State Legislature|1894]] (both New York Co., 10th D.). His participation in the machine helped assure that he was appointed to the Committee on General Laws in his first term.<ref>Matthew L. Lifflander ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer: A Story of American Politics'' (2012) p. 7</ref> During his time in the Assembly he introduced bills seeking to abolish [[debtors' prisons]], and to limit hours for workers. His popularity and loyalty to Tammany machine were such that in 1893, Tammany Boss [[Richard Croker]] selected Sulzer to be elected as [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly]]. The term was noted as being highly corrupt and highly partisan, as the Democratic machine dominated all committees, and with them the state budget. Sulzer himself declared during the term  \"[A]ll legislation came from Tammany Hall and was dictated by that great statesmen, Richard Croker.\"<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 21</ref>\n\nDuring his time in the Assembly, Sulzer was a delegate to the [[1892 Democratic National Convention]], and returned as such to every national convention until 1912.\n\n==United States Congressman==\n[[File:William Sulzer NY.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sulzer somewhere around the turn of the 20th century.]]\n[[File:John Tener Governor.jpg|thumb|Pennsylvania Governor [[John K.

Declaring himself to be a \"friend to all humanity and a champion of liberty\", he supported the Cuban rebels during their [[Cuban War of Independence|War of Independence]], and during the [[Second Boer War]] introduced a resolution supporting the [[Boer Republics]] and banning the sale of military supplies and munitions to the [[British Empire]]. Repeatedly he called for resolutions condemning [[Czarist Russia]] over the issue of [[pogroms]]. In the [[Sixty-second United States Congress]] he chaired the Committee on Foreign Affairs, from which he proposed a resolution praising the [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution of 1911]]. He also opposed United States intervention in the [[Mexican Revolution]], and proposed a unanimously supported bill to annul the [[Treaty of 1832]] with Russia due to a Russian refusal to recognize the passports of [[Jewish-Americans]].<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 27</ref>\n\nSulzer during his time in Congress supported numerous [[Progressive era|Progressive]] goals in terms of popular democracy and efficiency. He was a supporter of the creation of the [[United States Department of Labor]], the direct election of senators --- for which he proposed a resolution in support of --- and the [[eight-hour day]]. In the [[Election of 1896]] he supported the nomination of and campaigned for [[William Jennings Bryan]].<ref>Lifflander ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer: A story of American Politics'' p. 18</ref>\n\nIn [[New York state election, 1896|1896]], for the first time he announced his candidacy for the governorship but was rejected by Tammany and the Democratic Party at large. In [[New York state election, 1898|1898]] Richard Croker openly opposed his attempt for the Democratic nomination.<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 24</ref> For the next six elections Sulzer was continually rejected for the Democratic nomination for governor, losing to Tammany supported politicians such as [[William Randolph Hearst]], and [[John Alden Dix]].\n\nIn 1912 though, the split between the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressives]] meant that the Democratic nomination was likely to win. This in turn prompted a fight in the Democrats, as reformers disappointed in Governor Dix's support for Tammany moved to oust him from contention. The [[Empire State Democracy Party]] was even founded by reformers such as State Senator [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to run against Dix or any other clear Tammany candidate. In this crisis Sulzer found himself selected as a compromise candidate, acceptable to reform-minded and Tammany Democrats. The party united, Sulzer went on to defeat Republican [[Job E. Hedges]] and Progressive [[Oscar S. Straus]].\n\nHe resigned from Congress effective December 31, 1912, having been elected Governor of New York in [[New York state election, 1912|November 1912]] for the term beginning on January 1, 1913.\n\n==Governor of New York==\n[[File:William Sulzer, portrait taken by Chicago studio.jpg|thumb|right|Sulzer c. 1911]]\nSulzer was elected with the support of William Jennings Bryan, William Randolph Hearst and Woodrow Wilson, as well as the reform and Tammany factions of the state Democratic Party. Upon taking office Sulzer and Croker's successor [[Charles Francis Murphy|\"Silent Charlie\" Murphy]] began to turn against each other as Sulzer claimed control of the state Democratic Party, rather than staying loyal to Tammany.\n\n===Attempts at reform===\nOn taking office as governor, Sulzer in an initial move announced the renaming of the [[New York State Executive Mansion|Executive Mansion]] \"The People's House\".<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 40</ref> The populist rhetoric of this move was followed by a campaign to \"let the people rule\", through a series of reforms, including a move to promote open primaries for party nominations, and investigations into corruption in the legislature and executive branches of state government. At the same time Sulzer refused to follow Tammany decisions for state appointments. These moves would damage the power of Tammany and other machines, Democratic and Republican throughout the state, and empower Sulzer. The campaign for direct primaries would win him the support of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his Progressives, but also moved Tammany to stand firmly against him.<ref>Jay W. Forrest and James Malcolm ''Tammany's Treason: Impeachment of Governor Sulzer; the complete story written from behind the scenes, showing how Tammany plays the game, how men are bought, sold and delivered'' (1913) Pg 22</ref>\n\nCritics claimed that Sulzer was using the direct primary issue to build his own machine or to co-opt Tammany and assume control of it from Murphy, based on his populist appeal. Meanwhile, Sulzer and his supporters countered that the effort was necessary to promote fair government.<ref>Forrest, Malcom ''Tammany's Treason'' p. 46</ref>\n\nBy the end of April investigations against previously appointed Tammany officials had further developed the party split. And then on the 26th as the Open Primaries Bill moved to a vote Sulzer declared \"If any Democrat in this State is against the Democratic State platform, that man is no true Democrat, and as the Democratic Governor of the State I shall do everything in my power to drive that recreant Democrat out of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 111</ref> In spite of the threat, both Machine and Independent Democrats voted against the bill overwhelmingly. The Machine delegates, led by [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] [[Al Smith]] followed the orders of Murphy, while the Independent Democrats, mostly from rural, [[Upstate New York]] opposed the bill fearing that Open primaries would silence their influence and power against the weight of the urban vote.\n\nSulzer's refusal to work with Tammany on appointments was a major threat to the organization, which had since its foundation been dependent on Civil Service work to develop its power. One of the appointments that Sulzer refused to make was that of James E. Gaffney, owner of the 1914 \"Miracle\" Braves, to State Commissioner of Highways.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/01/22/100415620.pdf |title=Sulzer Gives Graft Clues \u2013 Quotes Senator O'Gorman as Saying Gaffney Couldn't \"Blackjack\" His Client |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 22, 1914 |accessdate=August 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nEven after the defeat of the vote, Sulzer vowed to continue his fight with Murphy and the other bosses, and that there would be no Compromise. In response, the Tammany-allied [[New York State Comptroller|State Comptroller]] [[William Sohmer]] moved to freeze payrolls for state highway and prison projects, and the [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] under the leadership of another Tammany officer [[Robert F. Wagner]] refused to approve the Governor's appointments to the [[New York Public Service Commission]].\n\n===Impeachment===\n\nAs the conflict between Sulzer and Tammany moved on, accusations arose against the Governor, claiming that he committed perjury in an 1890 lawsuit, that he had been involved in fraudulent companies in Cuba while a Congressman, and that he was sued by a [[Philadelphia]] woman, who swore that he had broken a 1903 promise to marry her. He rejected all these claims and characterized the breach of promise lawsuit as a \"frame-up\".<ref>Lifflander ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer: A story of American Politics'' p. 132</ref>\n\nIn May 1913, a Joint Committee was established by the state legislature to investigate the financial conduct of state institutions, with Senator [[James J. Frawley]], a loyal Tammany Hall Democrat, appointed its Chairman. That summer the committee, using Tammany-provided information, accused Sulzer of having diverted campaign contributions to purchase stocks for himself and to have lied under oath in regards to it. Sulzer, his supporters and many historians later affirmed that the impeachment charges were made under instructions from Murphy, to remove him as an obstacle to Tammany Hall's influence in state politics. Sulzer's questioned the constitutionality of the committee. But as evidence was raised over his use of campaign funds, he began to lose the support of the national [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], including [[William Randolph Hearst]].\n\nOn August 11, 1913 the findings of the Frawley committee were announced to the state legislature, and moves began towards impeachment, managed by Tammany Hall's legislative leaders. The only support Sulzer had was in the [[progressivism|Progressive]] legislators, who were too few to slow the process down.<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 131</ref> Over the next two days the Governor opposed the secession at every term but was powerless to stop it, as Al Smith and Robert F. Wagner, Sr. maintained control of their respective houses.\n\nIn a last-minute attempt to prevent impeachment, the Governor's wife admitted to having been responsible for the theft of campaign funds, while the minority in the state Assembly allied to the Governor attempted to postpone proceedings based on the new evidence, but were unsuccessful and the decision came to a vote.<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 161</ref>\n\nOn August 13, 1913, the New York Assembly voted to impeach Governor Sulzer, by a vote of 79 to 45. Sulzer was served with a summons to appear before the [[New York Court for the Trial of Impeachments|Court for the Trial of Impeachments]], and [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Martin H. Glynn]] was empowered to act in his place pending the outcome of the trial. However, Sulzer maintained that the proceedings against him were unconstitutional and refused to hand over his powers and duties.<ref>\"Sulzer Impeached by Assembly but Refuses to Surrender Office\", ''[[Syracuse Herald-Journal|Syracuse Herald]]'', August 13, 1913, p. 1.</ref> Lt.

Sulzer had called upon [[Louis Marshall]] to head his defense team and Marshall agreed, telling his wife that he was not enthusiastic about the outcome.<ref>Alpert, Herbert.

The court convicted Sulzer on three of the Articles of Impeachment on the afternoon of October 16, finding him guilty of filing a false report with the Secretary of State concerning his campaign contributions, committing perjury, and advising another person to commit perjury before an Assembly committee.<ref>\"Report Says Court Will Convict Governor on Three of Articles\", ''[[Syracuse Herald-Journal|Syracuse Herald]]'', October 16, 1913, p. 1.</ref> The following day, the court voted on a resolution to remove Sulzer from office. On October 17, 1913, Sulzer was removed by the same margin, a vote of 43\u201312, and Lt. Gov. Glynn succeeded to the governorship.<ref>\"High Court Removes Sulzer from Office by a Vote of 43 to 12\", ''[[Syracuse Herald-Journal|Syracuse Herald]]'', October 17, 1913, p. 1.</ref>\n\nAccording to the 1914 book, ''The Boss or the Governor'', by [[Samuel Bell Thomas]], a crowd of 10,000 gathered outside the Executive Mansion on the night Governor Sulzer left Albany, leading to an exchange as follows:\n\n:'''Mr. Sulzer:''' \"My friends, this is a stormy night. It is certainly very good of you to come here to bid Mrs. Sulzer and me good-bye.\"\n:'''A voice from the crowd''': \"You will come back, Bill, next year.\"\n:'''Mr. Sulzer''': \"You know why we are going away.\"\n:'''A voice''': \"Because you were too honest.\"\n:'''Mr. Sulzer''': \"I impeach the criminal conspirators, these looters and grafters, for stealing the taxpayers' money. That is what I never did.\"\n:'''From the crowd''': Cheers.\n:'''Mr. Sulzer''': \"Yes my friends, I know that the court of public opinion before long will reverse the judgement of Murphy's 'court of infamy.'\"\n:'''From the crowd''': Cheers.\n:'''Mr. Sulzer''': \"Posterity will do me justice. Time sets all things right. I shall be patient.\"\n:'''From the crowd''': Cheers.\n\nSome in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] maintained that he was impeached unfairly, as he had been the first person ever to have been impeached for acts committed before taking office. There have been several pieces of legislation introduced in the New York State Assembly and Senate to have his political record repaired. None have been successful to date.\n\n==Later life and political career==\n[[File:SulzerTheBroadAx.PNG|thumb|left|200px|William Sulzer in [[The Broad Ax]] newspaper December 23, 1922<ref>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Julius F.|title=The Broad Ax|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=TBA19221223.1.10&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------#|accessdate=June 17, 2015|issue=14|date=December 23, 1922}}</ref>]]\nSulzer was able to recover somewhat politically. Just a few weeks after the impeachment, he was elected on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive]] ticket to the [[New York State Assembly]], and was a member of the [[137th New York State Legislature]] (New York Co., 6th D.) in 1914.\n\nFor the [[New York state election, 1914]], he organized the [[American Party (1914)|American Party]] as a [[Spoiler effect|spoiler]], to defeat [[Martin H. Glynn]], his former lieutenant governor who had succeeded him as governor, and was running for re-election. Sulzer also attempted to gain the Progressive Party nomination for governor, but was defeated in the primary, partly due to the intervention of Theodore Roosevelt who, in a letter to all members of the party, declared \"the trouble with Sulzer is that he does not tell the truth.\"<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 266</ref> However, Sulzer found support in the [[Prohibition Party]] which, on the basis of a speech he gave denouncing rum, nominated him for governor in 1914.<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 266\u201368</ref> He came in third, behind Republican [[Charles S. Whitman]], who was elected governor, and Glynn, who was unseated. Sulzer thus claimed that the result was a moral victory, as the Democrats who had impeached him were swept out of power.\n\nIn the [[1916 United States presidential election|Election of 1916]] Sulzer was the Presidential nominee of the American Party.<ref>https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/07/23/104237594.pdf</ref>\n\nLeaving politics, he engaged in the practice of law in New York City.

He was the [[List of Governors of New York|39th Governor of New York]] and a long-serving congressman from the same state. He was the first and so far only New York governor to be impeached. He broke with his sponsors at [[Tammany Hall]], and they produced convincing evidence that Sulzer had falsified his sworn statement of campaign expenditures.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date= August 14, 2017 |title=Here's why William Sulzer was the first \u2014 and still only \u2014 NY governor to be impeached |first= JOSEPH |last=MCNAMARA |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/william-sulzer-ny-governor-impeached-article-1.2872925}}</ref>\n\n==Personal==\nWilliam Sulzer was born in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], on March 18, 1863, the son of Thomas Sulzer, who was German born, and Mary Cooney of Ireland. He was the second in a family of eight children, and his siblings included [[Charles August Sulzer]], who pursued a successful political career in [[Alaska]]. He was reared on his family farm and attended the public schools of Elizabeth. At age 12 he left home and sailed as a [[cabin boy]] aboard a [[brig]], the ''William H. Thompson.'' He returned to the family home a year later and became a clerk in a grocery store.<ref name=NYTObituary/>\n\nSulzer took night classes at [[Cooper Union]] before attending lectures at [[Columbia Law School]] and [[reading law|studying law]] with the New York City firm of Parish & Pendleton.  He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1884, and commenced practice in [[New York City]]. Even before beginning his law practice, he was a member of [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]] serving as a popular stump speaker.<ref>Jacob Alexis Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' (1939), p. 16</ref><ref name=NYTObituary>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/11/07/104306444.pdf \"William Sulzer, Ex-Governor, 78,\" ''The New York Times,'' November 7, 1941]</ref>\n\nHe married Clara Rodelheim in 1908.\n\n==Career==\n\nSulzer's career in politics began in 1884 when he worked for the Tammany Hall political machine on New York's East Side as a stump speaker for various Democratic campaigns including the presidential campaign of then-Governor [[Grover Cleveland]]\n\nSulzer was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] in [[113th New York State Legislature|1890]], [[114th New York State Legislature|1891]], [[115th New York State Legislature|1892]] (all three New York Co., 14th D.), [[116th New York State Legislature|1893]] and [[117th New York State Legislature|1894]] (both New York Co., 10th D.). His participation in the machine helped assure that he was appointed to the Committee on General Laws in his first term.<ref>Matthew L. Lifflander ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer: A Story of American Politics'' (2012) p. 7</ref> During his time in the Assembly he introduced bills seeking to abolish [[debtors' prisons]], and to limit hours for workers. His popularity and loyalty to Tammany machine were such that in 1893, Tammany Boss [[Richard Croker]] selected Sulzer to be elected as [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly]]. The term was noted as being highly corrupt and highly partisan, as the Democratic machine dominated all committees, and with them the state budget. Sulzer himself declared during the term  \"[A]ll legislation came from Tammany Hall and was dictated by that great statesmen, Richard Croker.\"<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 21</ref>\n\nDuring his time in the Assembly, Sulzer was a delegate to the [[1892 Democratic National Convention]], and returned as such to every national convention until 1912.\n\n==United States Congressman==\n[[File:William Sulzer NY.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sulzer somewhere around the turn of the 20th century.]]\n[[File:John Tener Governor.jpg|thumb|Pennsylvania Governor [[John K.

Declaring himself to be a \"friend to all humanity and a champion of liberty\", he supported the Cuban rebels during their [[Cuban War of Independence|War of Independence]], and during the [[Second Boer War]] introduced a resolution supporting the [[Boer Republics]] and banning the sale of military supplies and munitions to the [[British Empire]]. Repeatedly he called for resolutions condemning [[Czarist Russia]] over the issue of [[pogroms]]. In the [[Sixty-second United States Congress]] he chaired the Committee on Foreign Affairs, from which he proposed a resolution praising the [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution of 1911]]. He also opposed United States intervention in the [[Mexican Revolution]], and proposed a unanimously supported bill to annul the [[Treaty of 1832]] with Russia due to a Russian refusal to recognize the passports of [[Jewish-Americans]].<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 27</ref>\n\nSulzer during his time in Congress supported numerous [[Progressive era|Progressive]] goals in terms of popular democracy and efficiency. He was a supporter of the creation of the [[United States Department of Labor]], the direct election of senators --- for which he proposed a resolution in support of --- and the [[eight-hour day]]. In the [[Election of 1896]] he supported the nomination of and campaigned for [[William Jennings Bryan]].<ref>Lifflander ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer: A story of American Politics'' p. 18</ref>\n\nIn [[New York state election, 1896|1896]], for the first time he announced his candidacy for the governorship but was rejected by Tammany and the Democratic Party at large. In [[New York state election, 1898|1898]] Richard Croker openly opposed his attempt for the Democratic nomination.<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 24</ref> For the next six elections Sulzer was continually rejected for the Democratic nomination for governor, losing to Tammany supported politicians such as [[William Randolph Hearst]], and [[John Alden Dix]].\n\nIn 1912 though, the split between the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressives]] meant that the Democratic nomination was likely to win. This in turn prompted a fight in the Democrats, as reformers disappointed in Governor Dix's support for Tammany moved to oust him from contention. The [[Empire State Democracy Party]] was even founded by reformers such as State Senator [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to run against Dix or any other clear Tammany candidate. In this crisis Sulzer found himself selected as a compromise candidate, acceptable to reform-minded and Tammany Democrats. The party united, Sulzer went on to defeat Republican [[Job E. Hedges]] and Progressive [[Oscar S. Straus]].\n\nHe resigned from Congress effective December 31, 1912, having been elected Governor of New York in [[New York state election, 1912|November 1912]] for the term beginning on January 1, 1913.\n\n==Governor of New York==\n[[File:William Sulzer, portrait taken by Chicago studio.jpg|thumb|right|Sulzer c. 1911]]\nSulzer was elected with the support of William Jennings Bryan, William Randolph Hearst and Woodrow Wilson, as well as the reform and Tammany factions of the state Democratic Party. Upon taking office Sulzer and Croker's successor [[Charles Francis Murphy|\"Silent Charlie\" Murphy]] began to turn against each other as Sulzer claimed control of the state Democratic Party, rather than staying loyal to Tammany.\n\n===Attempts at reform===\nOn taking office as governor, Sulzer in an initial move announced the renaming of the [[New York State Executive Mansion|Executive Mansion]] \"The People's House\".<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 40</ref> The populist rhetoric of this move was followed by a campaign to \"let the people rule\", through a series of reforms, including a move to promote open primaries for party nominations, and investigations into corruption in the legislature and executive branches of state government. At the same time Sulzer refused to follow Tammany decisions for state appointments. These moves would damage the power of Tammany and other machines, Democratic and Republican throughout the state, and empower Sulzer. The campaign for direct primaries would win him the support of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his Progressives, but also moved Tammany to stand firmly against him.<ref>Jay W. Forrest and James Malcolm ''Tammany's Treason: Impeachment of Governor Sulzer; the complete story written from behind the scenes, showing how Tammany plays the game, how men are bought, sold and delivered'' (1913) Pg 22</ref>\n\nCritics claimed that Sulzer was using the direct primary issue to build his own machine or to co-opt Tammany and assume control of it from Murphy, based on his populist appeal. Meanwhile, Sulzer and his supporters countered that the effort was necessary to promote fair government.<ref>Forrest, Malcom ''Tammany's Treason'' p. 46</ref>\n\nBy the end of April investigations against previously appointed Tammany officials had further developed the party split. And then on the 26th as the Open Primaries Bill moved to a vote Sulzer declared \"If any Democrat in this State is against the Democratic State platform, that man is no true Democrat, and as the Democratic Governor of the State I shall do everything in my power to drive that recreant Democrat out of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 111</ref> In spite of the threat, both Machine and Independent Democrats voted against the bill overwhelmingly. The Machine delegates, led by [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] [[Al Smith]] followed the orders of Murphy, while the Independent Democrats, mostly from rural, [[Upstate New York]] opposed the bill fearing that Open primaries would silence their influence and power against the weight of the urban vote.\n\nSulzer's refusal to work with Tammany on appointments was a major threat to the organization, which had since its foundation been dependent on Civil Service work to develop its power. One of the appointments that Sulzer refused to make was that of James E. Gaffney, owner of the 1914 \"Miracle\" Braves, to State Commissioner of Highways.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/01/22/100415620.pdf |title=Sulzer Gives Graft Clues \u2013 Quotes Senator O'Gorman as Saying Gaffney Couldn't \"Blackjack\" His Client |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 22, 1914 |accessdate=August 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nEven after the defeat of the vote, Sulzer vowed to continue his fight with Murphy and the other bosses, and that there would be no Compromise. In response, the Tammany-allied [[New York State Comptroller|State Comptroller]] [[William Sohmer]] moved to freeze payrolls for state highway and prison projects, and the [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] under the leadership of another Tammany officer [[Robert F. Wagner]] refused to approve the Governor's appointments to the [[New York Public Service Commission]].\n\n===Impeachment===\n\nAs the conflict between Sulzer and Tammany moved on, accusations arose against the Governor, claiming that he committed perjury in an 1890 lawsuit, that he had been involved in fraudulent companies in Cuba while a Congressman, and that he was sued by a [[Philadelphia]] woman, who swore that he had broken a 1903 promise to marry her. He rejected all these claims and characterized the breach of promise lawsuit as a \"frame-up\".<ref>Lifflander ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer: A story of American Politics'' p. 132</ref>\n\nIn May 1913, a Joint Committee was established by the state legislature to investigate the financial conduct of state institutions, with Senator [[James J. Frawley]], a loyal Tammany Hall Democrat, appointed its Chairman. That summer the committee, using Tammany-provided information, accused Sulzer of having diverted campaign contributions to purchase stocks for himself and to have lied under oath in regards to it. Sulzer, his supporters and many historians later affirmed that the impeachment charges were made under instructions from Murphy, to remove him as an obstacle to Tammany Hall's influence in state politics. Sulzer's questioned the constitutionality of the committee. But as evidence was raised over his use of campaign funds, he began to lose the support of the national [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], including [[William Randolph Hearst]].\n\nOn August 11, 1913 the findings of the Frawley committee were announced to the state legislature, and moves began towards impeachment, managed by Tammany Hall's legislative leaders. The only support Sulzer had was in the [[progressivism|Progressive]] legislators, who were too few to slow the process down.<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 131</ref> Over the next two days the Governor opposed the secession at every term but was powerless to stop it, as Al Smith and Robert F. Wagner, Sr. maintained control of their respective houses.\n\nIn a last-minute attempt to prevent impeachment, the Governor's wife admitted to having been responsible for the theft of campaign funds, while the minority in the state Assembly allied to the Governor attempted to postpone proceedings based on the new evidence, but were unsuccessful and the decision came to a vote.<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 161</ref>\n\nOn August 13, 1913, the New York Assembly voted to impeach Governor Sulzer, by a vote of 79 to 45. Sulzer was served with a summons to appear before the [[New York Court for the Trial of Impeachments|Court for the Trial of Impeachments]], and [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Martin H. Glynn]] was empowered to act in his place pending the outcome of the trial. However, Sulzer maintained that the proceedings against him were unconstitutional and refused to hand over his powers and duties.<ref>\"Sulzer Impeached by Assembly but Refuses to Surrender Office\", ''[[Syracuse Herald-Journal|Syracuse Herald]]'', August 13, 1913, p. 1.</ref> Lt. Gov.

Sulzer had called upon [[Louis Marshall]] to head his defense team and Marshall agreed, telling his wife that he was not enthusiastic about the outcome.<ref>Alpert, Herbert. ''Louis Marshall: 1856\u20131929''. p. 36\u201337, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-595-48230-6}}.</ref> The trial did not go well; Sulzer didn't even testify in his own defense. The court convicted Sulzer on three of the Articles of Impeachment on the afternoon of October 16, finding him guilty of filing a false report with the Secretary of State concerning his campaign contributions, committing perjury, and advising another person to commit perjury before an Assembly committee.<ref>\"Report Says Court Will Convict Governor on Three of Articles\", ''[[Syracuse Herald-Journal|Syracuse Herald]]'', October 16, 1913, p. 1.</ref> The following day, the court voted on a resolution to remove Sulzer from office. On October 17, 1913, Sulzer was removed by the same margin, a vote of 43\u201312, and Lt. Gov. Glynn succeeded to the governorship.<ref>\"High Court Removes Sulzer from Office by a Vote of 43 to 12\", ''[[Syracuse Herald-Journal|Syracuse Herald]]'', October 17, 1913, p. 1.</ref>\n\nAccording to the 1914 book, ''The Boss or the Governor'', by [[Samuel Bell Thomas]], a crowd of 10,000 gathered outside the Executive Mansion on the night Governor Sulzer left Albany, leading to an exchange as follows:\n\n:'''Mr. Sulzer:''' \"My friends, this is a stormy night. It is certainly very good of you to come here to bid Mrs. Sulzer and me good-bye.\"\n:'''A voice from the crowd''': \"You will come back, Bill, next year.\"\n:'''Mr. Sulzer''': \"You know why we are going away.\"\n:'''A voice''': \"Because you were too honest.\"\n:'''Mr. Sulzer''': \"I impeach the criminal conspirators, these looters and grafters, for stealing the taxpayers' money. That is what I never did.\"\n:'''From the crowd''': Cheers.\n:'''Mr. Sulzer''': \"Yes my friends, I know that the court of public opinion before long will reverse the judgement of Murphy's 'court of infamy.'\"\n:'''From the crowd''': Cheers.\n:'''Mr. Sulzer''': \"Posterity will do me justice. Time sets all things right. I shall be patient.\"\n:'''From the crowd''': Cheers.\n\nSome in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] maintained that he was impeached unfairly, as he had been the first person ever to have been impeached for acts committed before taking office. There have been several pieces of legislation introduced in the New York State Assembly and Senate to have his political record repaired. None have been successful to date.\n\n==Later life and political career==\n[[File:SulzerTheBroadAx.PNG|thumb|left|200px|William Sulzer in [[The Broad Ax]] newspaper December 23, 1922<ref>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Julius F.|title=The Broad Ax|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=TBA19221223.1.10&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------#|accessdate=June 17, 2015|issue=14|date=December 23, 1922}}</ref>]]\nSulzer was able to recover somewhat politically. Just a few weeks after the impeachment, he was elected on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive]] ticket to the [[New York State Assembly]], and was a member of the [[137th New York State Legislature]] (New York Co., 6th D.) in 1914.\n\nFor the [[New York state election, 1914]], he organized the [[American Party (1914)|American Party]] as a [[Spoiler effect|spoiler]], to defeat [[Martin H. Glynn]], his former lieutenant governor who had succeeded him as governor, and was running for re-election. Sulzer also attempted to gain the Progressive Party nomination for governor, but was defeated in the primary, partly due to the intervention of Theodore Roosevelt who, in a letter to all members of the party, declared \"the trouble with Sulzer is that he does not tell the truth.\"<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 266</ref> However, Sulzer found support in the [[Prohibition Party]] which, on the basis of a speech he gave denouncing rum, nominated him for governor in 1914.<ref>Fredman ''The Impeachment of Governor William Sulzer'' p. 266\u201368</ref> He came in third, behind Republican [[Charles S. Whitman]], who was elected governor, and Glynn, who was unseated. Sulzer thus claimed that the result was a moral victory, as the Democrats who had impeached him were swept out of power.\n\nIn the [[1916 United States presidential election|Election of 1916]] Sulzer was the Presidential nominee of the American Party.<ref>https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/07/23/104237594.pdf</ref>\n\nLeaving politics, he engaged in the practice of law in New York City.
