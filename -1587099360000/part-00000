Active in the aftermath of the 1970 [[Black Power Revolution]], the group fought a guerrilla campaign against the government of Prime Minister [[Eric Williams]] after the failed uprising.\n\nIn 1972 and 1973 NUFF attacked police posts to acquire weapons, robbed banks, and carried out an insurgent campaign against the government. With improved intelligence capabilities, the government was able to track the group and eventually killed or captured most of its leadership. Eighteen NUFF members and three policemen were killed over the course of the insurgency.\n\nNUFF was notable for the extent to which women played an active role in the organisation, and included women among its guerrilla fighters.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Black Power Revolution}}\nIn February 1970 Black Power demonstrations broke out in the major urban centres in Trinidad and Tobago.

The group, which consisted of largely unemployed young men, also included active members of the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment. According to one of the surviving members of the organisation, Malcolm \"Jai\" Kernahan, there was coordination between members of WOLF and [[Raffique Shah]] and [[Rex Lassalle]], the leaders of the army mutiny that predated April 1970. When the mutineers surrendered, Brian Jeffers, one of the leaders of WOLF, decided to continue the struggle.<ref name=\"Meeks2000\" />\n\n== Guerrilla campaign ==\n\nIn 1971, the unnamed revolutionary organisation shot Theodore Guerrra, the chief prosecutor in the court martial of the mutineers. Shortly after, Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard commander David Bloom was shot. Bloom had played an important role in the suppression of the mutiny. Both men survived the shooting.

He gathered a group of activists there and established a camp in the forest. On 31 May 1972 the group, newly named the National Union of Freedom Fighters, attacked an Estate Police Station belonging to the American oil company [[Texaco]], and seized six guns and over a thousand rounds of ammunition.

{"title_page": "Hindu mythological wars", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2015}}\n'''Ancient Hindu wars''' are the [[battle]]s described in the [[Hindu texts]] of ancient [[India]]. These battles depicted great [[hero]]es, [[demon]]s, celestial weapons and [[supernatural]] beings. Major wars were fought with the aim of upholding the ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness that brought [[prosperity]] to [[human]]ity) over ''[[Adharma]]'' (wickedness that causes humanity to suffer). The purpose of the wars is often described as the removal of demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursued war with ambition (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted. But, when this time comes, war is taught to be a matter of great personal and social importance, where every man who belongs to the warrior caste must do his duty, exemplifying courage, [[honor]], and fearsome prowess against all odds and even at the cost of his life.\n\nThe major Hindu gods, including [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], often engage in war, either in the form of [[Avatars]] or in their true form. They and many Hindu heroes use ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' \u2013 celestial weapons with fearsome supernatural power \u2013 to aid them in battle.\n\n[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|375px|The Battle of Kurukshetra, fought between the [[Kaurava]]s and the [[Pandava]]s, recorded in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.]]\n\n==In Vedic literature==\n\n===Indra and Vritra===\nThe central battle in the ''Vedas'' is between [[Indra]] and [[Vritra]], and the defeat of the demon Vritra leads to the liberation of rivers, cattle and ''[[Ushas]]'' ([[dawn]]/light). While this battle does reinforce the timeless good v/s evil theme, close examination of various hymns and verses in the [[Rigveda]] suggest this might have been an allegorical account of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system.<ref>[http://rigvedaanalysis.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/vrtra-myth-the-bharadvaja-version/ A record of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system?]</ref>\n\nAnother important battle is the historic [[Battle of the Ten Kings]], alluded to in the [[Rigveda]], in which the [[Tritsu]] clan, led by [[Sudas]], defeat the [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Puru]] confederation of ten [[Indo Aryan]] clans.<ref name=\"schmidt1980\">Schmidt, H.P.

Both races are technically equal, possessors of great religious and martial powers, but the Devas are committed to the worship of the [[Supreme Being]] and the practice of [[virtue]].

The king whose authority is contested must prove himself in battle or accept the imperial supremacy of the challenging king. When the horse returns safely after the period of time, the main sacrifice is performed, and the king, if successful in obtaining dominance over other kings, is crowned ''Emperor of the World''. The ''Ashwamedha'' allows the opportunity to maintain peace if the kings do not choose to contest the sacrificial horse. In the [[Mahabharata|Mahabharat]] era, [[Arjuna]] alone had conquered the whole world for the sake of ''Ashwamedha Yagya'' of his brother.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m14/m14085.htm|title=Digivijaya of Arjuna}}</ref>\n*''[[Rajasuya]]'': Considered the ultimate sacrifice, the king performing the sacrifice must openly challenge every king in the world to accept his supremacy or defeat him in battle.

In the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]], he is called Paramatman or Parameshwara (the highest form of God), and is periodically reborn as an [[Avatar]] upon earth in order to destroy evil and bring deliverance to the pious. He is also the refuge of the Devas in their battles against Asuras. The most martial Avatars include [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], [[Mohini]], [[Vamana]], [[Parshurama|Parshuram]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Kalki]]. He is also considered to be the first God, 'Adideva'. He is beyond birth, death, time. He is beyond all. In battle, the avatars of Vishnu are aided by a variety of ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' or celestial weapons. His two human avatars, Parashuram and Rama, were fearsome warriors and possessed many celestial weapons that accompany the past times of Vishnu. Krishna also used a few of these weapons in Mahabharata. These include:\n\n*''[[Kaumodaki]]'': The divine [[Gada (mace)|mace]] weapon of Vishnu; invincible and without parallel; Krishna slayed demon Dantavakra with it.\n*''Kodandam'': The bow of [[Rama]], 7th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Nandaka]]'': The sword of Vishnu\n*''[[Narayanastra]]'': Narayanastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Vaishnavastra. The personal missile weapon of Vishnu in his [[Narayana]] (Naraina) form, this ''astra'' lets loose a powerful tirade of millions of deadly missiles simultaneously. The intensity of the shower increases with resistance. The only solution is total submission before the missile; only then will it cease. The Narayanastra was first used by Rama in the ''Ramayana''. Then, thousands of years later, this astra was again used by [[Ashwatthama|Ashwathama]] in the [[Kurukshetra War]] against the [[Pandava]] army.\n*''[[Parashu]]'': The axe of [[Parashurama]], 6th avatar of [[Vishnu]], given by [[Shiva]].\n*''[[Sharanga (Hindu mythology)|Sharanga]]'': The celestial bow of Vishnu. \n*''Sharkha'': The bow of [[Krishna]], 8th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Sudarshana Chakra]]'': The magical ''Chakra'', a spinning disc with sharp outer spears. It is the most powerful Shastra in the universe, and without any parallel. The Chakra was famously designed by Vishwakarma for Vishnu. The Sudarshan flies at the command of Krishna, spinning away to tear off the heads of his opponents, or to perform any function desired by Vishnu. It was most famously used by [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n*''[[Vaishnavastra]]'': Vaishnavastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Narayanastra. The personal missile weapon of [[Krishna]], once fired it cannot be thwarted by any means, save by the will of [[Vishnu]] himself.

[[Tandava]] is the dance of the destroyer, which he performs over the body of a demon. Shiva employs his power to kill the [[Asura]] Tripura, destroying the flying three cities of Tripura. In battle, Shiva and his Avatars deploy formidable weapons controlled by him. Some of these are:\n\n*''Arrow of Shiva'': It can destroy creation.

Examples include arrows from bows. A ''[[shastra]]'' is a personal weapon, like swords and maces, that must be constantly operated by the warrior.\n\n*''[[Brahmastra]]'': Embedded with the mystical force of [[Brahma]], this weapon releases millions of missiles, great fires and a destructive potential capable of extinguishing all creation, if not used by and aimed only at a celestial fighter. Modern speculation has equated its destructive nature to be similar to that of a [[nuclear weapon]], it has been used multiple times in Ramayana, Indrajit used it against Hanuman, Lakshmana asked permission to use it against Indrajit, which Rama declined, Lakshmana used it to kill Atikaya,  Rama used it as final arrow to kill Ravana. In the epic Mahabharata, it is said that the weapon manifest with the single head of Brahma as its tip. In Mahabharata era Parasurama, Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Kripa, Ashwatthama, Arjuna, Yudhishtir and several Maharathi's possessed the knowledge to invoke this weapon.\n*''[[Brahmashirsha astra]]'': A weapon capable of greater destruction than the ''Brahmastra''. It can burn all creation to ashes once discharged, Arjuna and Ashwathama both used it against each other after the Mahabharata war. Capable of killing even heavens. Was used by Ashwatthama on Parikshit. It is thought that the Brahmashirsha is the evolution of the Brahmastra, 4 times stronger than Brahmastra. \"It blazes up with terrible flames within a huge sphere of fire. Numerous peals of thunder were heard, thousands of meteors fell and all living creatures became terrified with great dread. The entire sky seemed to be filled with noise and assumed a terrible aspect with flames of fire. The whole earth with her mountains and waters and trees trembled.\" When it strikes an area it will cause complete destruction and nothing will ever grow, not even a blade of grass for the next 12 years.

In some texts it is called Brahma-dhanda astra, the weapon created by [[Saptarishi]]'s to counter any weapon ever created, even that of [[Trimurti]]'s. The rishi of this weapon is [[Para Brahman]]. It is said to be the most difficult astra to obtain. Capable of destroying entire universe in a blink of an eye. [[Vishvamitra]] used all kinds of divine weapons against sage [[Vashistha]], even [[Pashupatastra]], but the Brahma-dhanda astra of [[Vashistha]] neutralized and swallowed all [[astra (weapon)]] of Vishwamitra proving that Brahma-dhanda astra is the most powerful of all astras.<ref name=\"Bala Khanda Sarga 56\">{{cite web | url=http://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1093926-bala-kanda-sarga-56/ | title=Brahmadhanda astra | accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>\n*''[[Pashupatastra]]'': In Hinduism, it is believed that Pashupatastra is the most devastating weapon, as it is the weapon of the consort of the God head Mahadeva, i.e. Mahakali. Mahadeva literally means \"Highest of all gods\" and Mahakali means \"Goddess who is beyond time\". This weapon was granted to [[Arjuna]] by Shiva. It is the most destructive and foreboding weapon in ''Mahabharata''. It was first used by Shiva for the destruction of tripura.  It is capable of destroying entire multiverse.

These battles depicted great [[hero]]es, [[demon]]s, celestial weapons and [[supernatural]] beings. Major wars were fought with the aim of upholding the ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness that brought [[prosperity]] to [[human]]ity) over ''[[Adharma]]'' (wickedness that causes humanity to suffer). The purpose of the wars is often described as the removal of demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursued war with ambition (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted. But, when this time comes, war is taught to be a matter of great personal and social importance, where every man who belongs to the warrior caste must do his duty, exemplifying courage, [[honor]], and fearsome prowess against all odds and even at the cost of his life.\n\nThe major Hindu gods, including [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], often engage in war, either in the form of [[Avatars]] or in their true form. They and many Hindu heroes use ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' \u2013 celestial weapons with fearsome supernatural power \u2013 to aid them in battle.\n\n[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|375px|The Battle of Kurukshetra, fought between the [[Kaurava]]s and the [[Pandava]]s, recorded in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.]]\n\n==In Vedic literature==\n\n===Indra and Vritra===\nThe central battle in the ''Vedas'' is between [[Indra]] and [[Vritra]], and the defeat of the demon Vritra leads to the liberation of rivers, cattle and ''[[Ushas]]'' ([[dawn]]/light).

When the horse returns safely after the period of time, the main sacrifice is performed, and the king, if successful in obtaining dominance over other kings, is crowned ''Emperor of the World''. The ''Ashwamedha'' allows the opportunity to maintain peace if the kings do not choose to contest the sacrificial horse.

It was most famously used by [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n*''[[Vaishnavastra]]'': Vaishnavastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Narayanastra. The personal missile weapon of [[Krishna]], once fired it cannot be thwarted by any means, save by the will of [[Vishnu]] himself.

Membership was expanded to [[Ivy League]] universities, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and [[List of colleges and universities in metropolitan Boston|higher education institutions in the Boston area]], then various other universities, and lastly high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though this may vary depending on local laws. The name comes from the [[face book]] directories often given to American university students.\n\nThe Facebook service can be accessed from devices with [[Internet]] connectivity, such as [[personal computer]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]] and [[smartphone]]s. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which is shared with any other users that have agreed to be their [[Friending and following|\"friend\"]], or, with a different privacy setting, with any reader. Users can also use various embedded apps, join common-interest groups, buy and sell items or services on Marketplace, and receive notifications of their Facebook friends' activities and activities of Facebook pages they follow. Facebook claimed that it had more than 2.3 billion monthly active users as of December 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-has-2-billion-plus-users-after-15-years-2019-2|title=In 15 years Facebook has amassed 2.3 billion users \u2014 more than followers of Christianity|first=Meira|last=Gebel|website=Business Insider}}</ref>\n\nFacebook has been subject to extensive media coverage and many controversies.

According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5&nbsp;GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom [[BitTorrent]]-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process has zero downtime. Changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.<ref name=\"Ars Technica BTS\" />\n\nFacebook used a combination platform based on [[HBase]] to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them to storage. The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] behavior. These requests are written to a log file using [[Scribe (log server)|Scribe]] (developed by Facebook).<ref name=\"high scalability\">{{cite web|url=http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/22/facebooks-new-realtime-analytics-system-hbase-to-process-20.html|title=Facebook's New Real-time Analytics System: HBase To Process 20 Billion Events Per Day|publisher=Highscalability.com|date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nData is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out. Ptail data are separated into three streams and sent to clusters in different [[data center]]s (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article generates many impressions and news feed impressions that cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a [[hash table]].<ref name=\"high scalability\" />\n\nData is then output in PHP format. The backend is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions display pages more quickly. The data is then sent to [[MapReduce]] servers where it is queried via Hive. This serves as a backup as the data can be recovered from Hive.<ref name=\"high scalability\" />\n\n====Hack====\nOn March 20, 2014, Facebook announced a new open-source programming language called [[Hack (programming language)|Hack]].

Membership was expanded to [[Ivy League]] universities, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and [[List of colleges and universities in metropolitan Boston|higher education institutions in the Boston area]], then various other universities, and lastly high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though this may vary depending on local laws. The name comes from the [[face book]] directories often given to American university students.\n\nThe Facebook service can be accessed from devices with [[Internet]] connectivity, such as [[personal computer]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]] and [[smartphone]]s. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which is shared with any other users that have agreed to be their [[Friending and following|\"friend\"]], or, with a different privacy setting, with any reader. Users can also use various embedded apps, join common-interest groups, buy and sell items or services on Marketplace, and receive notifications of their Facebook friends' activities and activities of Facebook pages they follow. Facebook claimed that it had more than 2.3 billion monthly active users as of December 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-has-2-billion-plus-users-after-15-years-2019-2|title=In 15 years Facebook has amassed 2.3 billion users \u2014 more than followers of Christianity|first=Meira|last=Gebel|website=Business Insider}}</ref>\n\nFacebook has been subject to extensive media coverage and many controversies.

According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5&nbsp;GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom [[BitTorrent]]-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process has zero downtime. Changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.<ref name=\"Ars Technica BTS\" />\n\nFacebook used a combination platform based on [[HBase]] to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them to storage. The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] behavior. These requests are written to a log file using [[Scribe (log server)|Scribe]] (developed by Facebook).<ref name=\"high scalability\">{{cite web|url=http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/22/facebooks-new-realtime-analytics-system-hbase-to-process-20.html|title=Facebook's New Real-time Analytics System: HBase To Process 20 Billion Events Per Day|publisher=Highscalability.com|date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nData is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out. Ptail data are separated into three streams and sent to clusters in different [[data center]]s (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article generates many impressions and news feed impressions that cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a [[hash table]].<ref name=\"high scalability\" />\n\nData is then output in PHP format. The backend is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions display pages more quickly. The data is then sent to [[MapReduce]] servers where it is queried via Hive. This serves as a backup as the data can be recovered from Hive.<ref name=\"high scalability\" />\n\n====Hack====\nOn March 20, 2014, Facebook announced a new open-source programming language called [[Hack (programming language)|Hack]].

He is a graduate of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he studied history and [[classics]].\n\nSaylor's best-known work is his ''[[Roma Sub Rosa]]''  [[historical mystery]] series, set in ancient Rome. The novels' hero is a detective named [[Gordianus the Finder]], active during the time of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar]], and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]]. Outside this crime novel series, Saylor has also written two epic-length historical novels about the city of Rome, ''[[Roma (2007 novel)|Roma]]'' and ''[[Empire (Saylor novel)|Empire]]''. His work has been published in 21 languages.\n\nSaylor has also written two novels set in Texas. ''A Twist at the End'', featuring [[O. Henry]], is set in Austin in the 1880s and based on real-life serial murders and trials (the case of the so-called [[Servant Girl Annihilator]]). ''Have You Seen Dawn?'' is a contemporary thriller set in a fictional Texas town, Amethyst, based on Saylor's hometown, [[Goldthwaite, Texas]].\n\nSaylor contributed autobiographical essays to three anthologies of gay writing edited by [[John Preston (author)|John Preston]], ''Hometowns'', ''A Member of the Family'', and ''Friends and Lovers'', and prior to his novel-writing career he published gay [[erotic fiction]] under the pen name '''Aaron Travis'''.\n\nSaylor has lived with [[Richard Solomon (activist)|Richard Solomon]] since 1976; they registered as [[domestic partnership|domestic partners]] in San Francisco in 1991 and later dissolved that partnership in order to legally marry in October 2008. The couple split their time between properties in [[Berkeley, California]], and [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name=\"glbtq\">{{citation |last=Rapp |first=Linda |title=Saylor, Steven |periodical=[[glbtq.com]] |year=2005}}.</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n=== ''[[Roma Sub Rosa]]'' ===\n*''[[The Seven Wonders (Roma Sub Rosa)|The Seven Wonders]]'' (2012), a [[fix-up]] novel, is a prequel recounting the journey of the young Gordianus to see the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] beginning in 92 BC.\n*''[[Raiders of the Nile]]'' (2014) is a direct sequel to ''The Seven Wonders'', about the further adventures of young Gordianus in Egypt and a plot to steal the golden sarcophagus of [[Alexander the Great]].\n*''[[Wrath of the Furies]]'' (2015) is a direct sequel to ''Raiders of the Nile'', where young Gordianus must travel incognito into the lands ruled by [[Mithridates the Great]].\n*''[[Roman Blood]]'' (1991), in which Gordianus is hired by the great orator and advocate [[Cicero]] in 80 BC.
