He starts out as a \"mystery man\", but eventually develops into a more standard [[superhero]], becoming a founder of the [[Justice Society of America]]. He later uses sand and a blowtorch that he could use to quickly create walls, and wears a purple and green costume. He would later pick up a sidekick, Sandy the Golden Boy.

After the first issue, the stories were written by [[Michael Fleisher]].  The second and third issues were illustrated by [[Ernie Chua]].  Inks were by Kirby, [[Mike Royer (comics)|Mike Royer]] and, in the sixth issue, [[Wally Wood]].  All covers were by Kirby, and the fourth issue noted his return to the interior artwork on the cover.\n\nThis Sandman was originally intended to be the actual [[Sandman (folklore)|Sandman]] of popular [[mythology|myth]], \"eternal and immortal\", despite his superhero-like appearance and adventures. The Sandman is assisted by two living nightmares named [[List of characters in The Sandman#Minor dreams|Brute and Glob]], whom he releases from domed cells with the help of a magic whistle.  They are nuisances who beg for release, who are intent on hand-to-hand combat, but are implied to be relatively harmless and well-intentioned once freed.  Using security monitoring devices, the Sandman can enter the \"Dream Stream\" or the \"Reality Stream\" (in which he acts like the superhero he looks like), and he carries a pouch of dream dust with which he can cause anyone to sleep and dream. The Sandman's main task is protecting children from nightmare monsters within their dreams, especially one young boy named [[Jed Walker|Jed]], who lives with his grandfather, Ezra Paulsen, as well as to ensure that children have an appropriate level of nightmares rather than dealing with such anxieties in real life.\n\nImplied to be a major foe of his is the Nightmare Wizard, who creates nightmares that are too extreme and sometimes kill children who dream them.  In none of his three appearances does the Nightmare Wizard serve as an antagonist, but the two are clearly opposed to each other.\n\nIn the final Fleischer-Kirby-created adventure ([[List of comics solicited but never published|intended for ''The Sandman'' #7]] but published in ''[[The Best of DC]]'' #22)<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/36154/ ''The Best of DC'' #22 (March 1982)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> he even assists the legendary [[Santa Claus]] against a menacing band of Seal Men who are angry about being sent the wrong gifts during the previous [[Christmas]].\n\nThis version of the Sandman only appeared for a handful of issues and was generally unused for years thereafter. In a [[retcon]] by [[Roy Thomas]], appearing in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' #300 (Feb. 1983), the Sandman is revealed to be '''Dr. Garrett Sanford''', a [[UCLA]] [[psychology]] professor who became trapped in the Dream Dimension while saving the life of a great man (there are hints that it is a [[President of the United States|U.S. President]]), who was in a coma while being terrorized by a powerful nightmare monster.  This issue, and the following appearance, note for the first time that his appearances outside the Dream Dimension were strictly limited to one hour, because physically entering the Dream Dimension was a one-way process, so others could send him equipment, but he could not be brought out.  Despite this, Sanford nevertheless tries to romance Diana in spite of her acceptance of [[Steve Trevor]]'s proposal of marriage.  The issue also introduced [[Fury (DC Comics)|Hippolyta Trevor]] (daughter of the [[Earth-Two]] counterparts of Diana and [[Steve Trevor]]), who would later be married to Sanford's successor, Hector Hall, and a major character in the Vertigo series as mother of [[Daniel Hall (comics)|Daniel Hall]].\n\nThe Sandman also becomes an honorary member of the [[Justice League of America|Justice League]] in ''Justice League of America Annual'' #1 (1983) (written by [[Paul Levitz]] and [[Len Wein]]), in which they fought [[Doctor Destiny]], who had trapped Sanford in a tube like those used for Brute and Glob, and eventually the Justice League as well.  Sanford declined a full membership because he cannot leave the Dream Dimension for more than an hour at a time.\n\nThe latter two appearances, and the subsequent uses of the costume, featured a red [[hourglass]] on the front of the suit that did not appear in the Kirby (or Chua) art.\n\nLetters pages in the original series often complained of the series being too juvenile,<ref>issue #2, issue #5\u2014Orlando responded that ''The Sandman'' and ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' were intended for very different audiences.  Sanford, Jed, Brute, and Glob eventually appeared in a one-panel cameo in ''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #62.</ref> while ''Wonder Woman'' #300 makes references to sexual dreams and has Sanford admit to observing Diana's dreams inappropriately.\n\nSandman, Jed, Brute, and Glob, observed by [[Metron (comics)|Metron]], appeared in one panel of ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' #62, [[Rick Veitch]]'s first writing on the series.\n\n===Hector Hall===\n{{Main|Hector Hall}}\n\nIn ''[[Infinity Inc.]]'' #50 (May 1988), it is revealed that Sanford had since gone insane due to the loneliness of the Dream Dimension and committed suicide, and that '''[[Hector Hall]]''' (formerly the Silver Scarab and son of [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]]) has now supplanted the deceased Sanford as the Sandman, and was, in fact, using Sanford's body after his own was taken by the Silver Scarab.\n\nIn ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' vol. 2 #12 (1990), it is further revealed that the Dream Dimension was, in fact, a small universe in the mind of Jed Walker which was created by Brute and Glob (who were explained as being two former servants of [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]] that had escaped his realm during the Lord of Dream's long absence). It turns out that Hall has actually died some years before, and that his incarnation as the Sandman is merely a shell that Dream sucks into another part of the Dreaming when he defeats the two creatures.\n\nHall goes on to be reincarnated as [[Doctor Fate]].  His only appearances as The Sandman are in ''Infinity Inc.'' #49\u201351, ''The Sandman'' vol. 2, #11\u201312 and ''The Sandman Presents: The Thessaliad'' #2.\n\n[[Ambush Bug]] briefly wore the Sanford/Hall costume in ''[[Ambush Bug Nothing Special]]'' #1, in an attempt to become sidekick to Dream.\n\nThis Sandman likeness appeared, along with Brute and Glob, in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #63\u201364. This time, the costume was worn by Sandy Hawkins.  Daniel Hall recaptured Brute and Glob and again retired the Kirby Sandman design.\n\n===Dream===\n{{Main|Dream (comics)|The Sandman (Vertigo)}}\n\n'''Dream''' aka '''Morpheus''' is one of seven archetypal beings referred to as [[The Endless (comics)|the Endless]] who embody various aspects of existence.  He is the main character of the second ''Sandman'' series, written by [[Neil Gaiman]]. Dream is the personification of [[dream]]s, [[storytelling]] and\u2014because the Endless also represent the opposite of that which they personify\u2014[[reality]].  Gaiman's Dream more closely resembles the concept of the Sandman as he is portrayed in mythology than a traditional superhero genre character. In the course of Gaiman's story arcs, it is [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] that the other DC Sandman characters were in various ways derived from Morpheus or his activities.  For instance, Wesley Dodds' prophetic dreams warning him of crimes and disasters are explained as an attempt by reality to fill the void left by Dream's absence from his realm during most of the 20th century, while the Kirby version of the Sandman is the result of two nightmares trying to manipulate a human being into fulfilling that same role in the hopes that they would be able to control the new incarnation of Dream.\n\n===Daniel Hall===\n{{Main|Daniel Hall (comics)}}\n\n'''Daniel Hall''', the child of Hector Hall, eventually assumes the position of Dream when Morpheus dies. He, like Morpheus, is the embodiment of dreams, storytelling and reality. He refers to himself as simply \"Dream of the Endless\"; in ''[[The Sandman: The Wake|The Wake]]'' he states that he has no right to the name of \"Morpheus\", and that the part of him which was the mortal boy Daniel Hall no longer exists.\n\n===Sandy Hawkins===\n{{Main|Sandy Hawkins}}\n\nSome time later in the pages of ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' 63\u201364, the chairman and heir to the Sandman legacy '''[[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]]''' has his soul stolen by Brute and Glob to briefly assume the role of the Dream Dimension's protector, again in the Kirby-designed costume. Eventually, Dr Fate (Hector Hall) and his wife Lyta lead a contingent of the JSA to Sand's rescue. Brute and Glob are abjured to parts known only as \"The Darkness\".  This fragment of the Dream Dimension is currently not known to be inhabited.\n\nSubsequently, Sand officially adopted the Sandman name and a costume patterned after Wesley Dodds in the third volume of ''Justice Society of America''.\n\n===Kieran Marshall===\n[[Image:SMTVSR Cv3.jpg|thumb|Kieran Marshall as the Sandman on the cover of  ''Sandman Mystery Theatre: Sleep of Reason'' #3. Art by Tim Bradstreet.]]\nIn the ''Sandman Mystery Theatre: Sleep of Reason'' mini-series, photojournalist Kieran Marshall briefly takes on the identity of the Sandman to battle terrorists in [[Afghanistan]], inspired by a visit Wesley Dodds made to the region shortly before his death.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n\n====Live-action====\n* An unrelated Sandman appeared in the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episodes \"The Sandman Cometh\" and \"The Catwoman Goeth\" portrayed by [[Michael Rennie]]. He is an international criminal who uses special hypnotic sands to control sleepwalkers to do his bidding. Under the alias of '''Dr. Somnambular''', he collaborates with [[Catwoman]] to steal the fortune of J. Pauline Spaghetti.\n* A version of the Sandman going under the pseudonym of '''[[Nightshade (DC Comics)|The Nightshade]]''' makes recurring appearances in [[The Flash (1990 TV series)| the 1990 version of ''The Flash'']], portrayed by [[Jason Bernard]]. He retained the Sandman's costume and knockout dart gun. This version is '''Dr. Desmond Powell''', a 1950s vigilante who captured criminals using tranquilizer darts. Gave up being a vigilante after he stopped The Ghost in 1955; later became a Doctor and Chief of Staff at Central City Hospital. When the Ghost reappears in 1990, Powell becomes Nightshade once again and teams up with the Flash to apprehend the Ghost. Later unknowingly inspires the '''Deadly Nightshade'''; is framed for multiple counts of murder, but clears his name and captures the impostor. Makes his secret identity public and becomes a celebrity.\n* Wesley Dodds appeared in the two-hour special episode of ''[[Smallville]]'' entitled \"[[Absolute Justice]]\", portrayed by [[Ken Lawson]]. He was shown as being a member of the now-disbanded [[Justice Society of America]]. He is first seen dreaming about the death of the [[Star-Spangled Kid]], and after waking up he puts on his costume and stands in front of a mirror. Without warning, [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] appears and kills him. His body was found by Clark Kent with multiple stab wounds in his chest.\n* Sandman's helmet appears in [[Rip Hunter]]'s office in ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''.\n\n====Animated====\n* In the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"Crisis 22,300 Miles Above Earth!\", Wesley Dodds helps out the Justice Society of America and the Justice League in the battle against [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s men. The other Sandman, Sandy Hawkins, is seen in the background of one of the scenes in the Watchtower.\n* Sandman makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode \"Humanity\".

They have appeared in stories of various genres, including the pulp detective character [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Wesley Dodds]], [[superhero]]es such as Garrett Sanford and [[Hector Hall]], and mythic [[fantasy]] characters more commonly called by the name [[Dream (comics)|Dream]].  Named after [[Sandman|the folklore character]] that is said to bring pleasant dreams to children, each has had some thematic connection to [[dream]]ing, and efforts have been made to tie them into a common continuity within the [[DC Universe]].\n\n==Fictional character biographies==\n\n===Wesley Dodds===\n{{Main|Sandman (Wesley Dodds)}}\n\n'''Wesley Dodds''' is the first DC Comics fictional character to bear the name of the Sandman.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/sandman1.htm |title=The Sandman}}</ref> Attired in a green business suit, [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]], and [[gas mask]], the Sandman uses a gun emitting a sleeping gas to sedate criminals. He starts out as a \"mystery man\", but eventually develops into a more standard [[superhero]], becoming a founder of the [[Justice Society of America]]. He later uses sand and a blowtorch that he could use to quickly create walls, and wears a purple and green costume. He would later pick up a sidekick, Sandy the Golden Boy. The Sandman appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #40 (July 1939) through #102 (Feb 1946).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/146 |accessdate=1 April 2020 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n===Garrett Sanford===\n{{Infobox comic book title|  <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--> \n| title = Sandman\n| image = Sandman 1974 issue1.jpg\n| caption = ''The Sandman''  #1.

After the first issue, the stories were written by [[Michael Fleisher]].  The second and third issues were illustrated by [[Ernie Chua]].  Inks were by Kirby, [[Mike Royer (comics)|Mike Royer]] and, in the sixth issue, [[Wally Wood]].  All covers were by Kirby, and the fourth issue noted his return to the interior artwork on the cover.\n\nThis Sandman was originally intended to be the actual [[Sandman (folklore)|Sandman]] of popular [[mythology|myth]], \"eternal and immortal\", despite his superhero-like appearance and adventures. The Sandman is assisted by two living nightmares named [[List of characters in The Sandman#Minor dreams|Brute and Glob]], whom he releases from domed cells with the help of a magic whistle.  They are nuisances who beg for release, who are intent on hand-to-hand combat, but are implied to be relatively harmless and well-intentioned once freed.  Using security monitoring devices, the Sandman can enter the \"Dream Stream\" or the \"Reality Stream\" (in which he acts like the superhero he looks like), and he carries a pouch of dream dust with which he can cause anyone to sleep and dream. The Sandman's main task is protecting children from nightmare monsters within their dreams, especially one young boy named [[Jed Walker|Jed]], who lives with his grandfather, Ezra Paulsen, as well as to ensure that children have an appropriate level of nightmares rather than dealing with such anxieties in real life.\n\nImplied to be a major foe of his is the Nightmare Wizard, who creates nightmares that are too extreme and sometimes kill children who dream them.  In none of his three appearances does the Nightmare Wizard serve as an antagonist, but the two are clearly opposed to each other.\n\nIn the final Fleischer-Kirby-created adventure ([[List of comics solicited but never published|intended for ''The Sandman'' #7]] but published in ''[[The Best of DC]]'' #22)<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/36154/ ''The Best of DC'' #22 (March 1982)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> he even assists the legendary [[Santa Claus]] against a menacing band of Seal Men who are angry about being sent the wrong gifts during the previous [[Christmas]].\n\nThis version of the Sandman only appeared for a handful of issues and was generally unused for years thereafter. In a [[retcon]] by [[Roy Thomas]], appearing in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' #300 (Feb. 1983), the Sandman is revealed to be '''Dr. Garrett Sanford''', a [[UCLA]] [[psychology]] professor who became trapped in the Dream Dimension while saving the life of a great man (there are hints that it is a [[President of the United States|U.S. President]]), who was in a coma while being terrorized by a powerful nightmare monster.  This issue, and the following appearance, note for the first time that his appearances outside the Dream Dimension were strictly limited to one hour, because physically entering the Dream Dimension was a one-way process, so others could send him equipment, but he could not be brought out.  Despite this, Sanford nevertheless tries to romance Diana in spite of her acceptance of [[Steve Trevor]]'s proposal of marriage.  The issue also introduced [[Fury (DC Comics)|Hippolyta Trevor]] (daughter of the [[Earth-Two]] counterparts of Diana and [[Steve Trevor]]), who would later be married to Sanford's successor, Hector Hall, and a major character in the Vertigo series as mother of [[Daniel Hall (comics)|Daniel Hall]].\n\nThe Sandman also becomes an honorary member of the [[Justice League of America|Justice League]] in ''Justice League of America Annual'' #1 (1983) (written by [[Paul Levitz]] and [[Len Wein]]), in which they fought [[Doctor Destiny]], who had trapped Sanford in a tube like those used for Brute and Glob, and eventually the Justice League as well.  Sanford declined a full membership because he cannot leave the Dream Dimension for more than an hour at a time.\n\nThe latter two appearances, and the subsequent uses of the costume, featured a red [[hourglass]] on the front of the suit that did not appear in the Kirby (or Chua) art.\n\nLetters pages in the original series often complained of the series being too juvenile,<ref>issue #2, issue #5\u2014Orlando responded that ''The Sandman'' and ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' were intended for very different audiences.  Sanford, Jed, Brute, and Glob eventually appeared in a one-panel cameo in ''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #62.</ref> while ''Wonder Woman'' #300 makes references to sexual dreams and has Sanford admit to observing Diana's dreams inappropriately.\n\nSandman, Jed, Brute, and Glob, observed by [[Metron (comics)|Metron]], appeared in one panel of ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' #62, [[Rick Veitch]]'s first writing on the series.\n\n===Hector Hall===\n{{Main|Hector Hall}}\n\nIn ''[[Infinity Inc.]]'' #50 (May 1988), it is revealed that Sanford had since gone insane due to the loneliness of the Dream Dimension and committed suicide, and that '''[[Hector Hall]]''' (formerly the Silver Scarab and son of [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]]) has now supplanted the deceased Sanford as the Sandman, and was, in fact, using Sanford's body after his own was taken by the Silver Scarab.\n\nIn ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' vol. 2 #12 (1990), it is further revealed that the Dream Dimension was, in fact, a small universe in the mind of Jed Walker which was created by Brute and Glob (who were explained as being two former servants of [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]] that had escaped his realm during the Lord of Dream's long absence). It turns out that Hall has actually died some years before, and that his incarnation as the Sandman is merely a shell that Dream sucks into another part of the Dreaming when he defeats the two creatures.\n\nHall goes on to be reincarnated as [[Doctor Fate]].  His only appearances as The Sandman are in ''Infinity Inc.'' #49\u201351, ''The Sandman'' vol. 2, #11\u201312 and ''The Sandman Presents: The Thessaliad'' #2.\n\n[[Ambush Bug]] briefly wore the Sanford/Hall costume in ''[[Ambush Bug Nothing Special]]'' #1, in an attempt to become sidekick to Dream.\n\nThis Sandman likeness appeared, along with Brute and Glob, in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #63\u201364. This time, the costume was worn by Sandy Hawkins.  Daniel Hall recaptured Brute and Glob and again retired the Kirby Sandman design.\n\n===Dream===\n{{Main|Dream (comics)|The Sandman (Vertigo)}}\n\n'''Dream''' aka '''Morpheus''' is one of seven archetypal beings referred to as [[The Endless (comics)|the Endless]] who embody various aspects of existence.  He is the main character of the second ''Sandman'' series, written by [[Neil Gaiman]]. Dream is the personification of [[dream]]s, [[storytelling]] and\u2014because the Endless also represent the opposite of that which they personify\u2014[[reality]].  Gaiman's Dream more closely resembles the concept of the Sandman as he is portrayed in mythology than a traditional superhero genre character. In the course of Gaiman's story arcs, it is [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] that the other DC Sandman characters were in various ways derived from Morpheus or his activities.  For instance, Wesley Dodds' prophetic dreams warning him of crimes and disasters are explained as an attempt by reality to fill the void left by Dream's absence from his realm during most of the 20th century, while the Kirby version of the Sandman is the result of two nightmares trying to manipulate a human being into fulfilling that same role in the hopes that they would be able to control the new incarnation of Dream.\n\n===Daniel Hall===\n{{Main|Daniel Hall (comics)}}\n\n'''Daniel Hall''', the child of Hector Hall, eventually assumes the position of Dream when Morpheus dies. He, like Morpheus, is the embodiment of dreams, storytelling and reality. He refers to himself as simply \"Dream of the Endless\"; in ''[[The Sandman: The Wake|The Wake]]'' he states that he has no right to the name of \"Morpheus\", and that the part of him which was the mortal boy Daniel Hall no longer exists.\n\n===Sandy Hawkins===\n{{Main|Sandy Hawkins}}\n\nSome time later in the pages of ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' 63\u201364, the chairman and heir to the Sandman legacy '''[[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]]''' has his soul stolen by Brute and Glob to briefly assume the role of the Dream Dimension's protector, again in the Kirby-designed costume. Eventually, Dr Fate (Hector Hall) and his wife Lyta lead a contingent of the JSA to Sand's rescue. Brute and Glob are abjured to parts known only as \"The Darkness\".  This fragment of the Dream Dimension is currently not known to be inhabited.\n\nSubsequently, Sand officially adopted the Sandman name and a costume patterned after Wesley Dodds in the third volume of ''Justice Society of America''.\n\n===Kieran Marshall===\n[[Image:SMTVSR Cv3.jpg|thumb|Kieran Marshall as the Sandman on the cover of  ''Sandman Mystery Theatre: Sleep of Reason'' #3. Art by Tim Bradstreet.]]\nIn the ''Sandman Mystery Theatre: Sleep of Reason'' mini-series, photojournalist Kieran Marshall briefly takes on the identity of the Sandman to battle terrorists in [[Afghanistan]], inspired by a visit Wesley Dodds made to the region shortly before his death.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n\n====Live-action====\n* An unrelated Sandman appeared in the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episodes \"The Sandman Cometh\" and \"The Catwoman Goeth\" portrayed by [[Michael Rennie]]. He is an international criminal who uses special hypnotic sands to control sleepwalkers to do his bidding. Under the alias of '''Dr. Somnambular''', he collaborates with [[Catwoman]] to steal the fortune of J. Pauline Spaghetti.\n* A version of the Sandman going under the pseudonym of '''[[Nightshade (DC Comics)|The Nightshade]]''' makes recurring appearances in [[The Flash (1990 TV series)| the 1990 version of ''The Flash'']], portrayed by [[Jason Bernard]]. He retained the Sandman's costume and knockout dart gun. This version is '''Dr. Desmond Powell''', a 1950s vigilante who captured criminals using tranquilizer darts. Gave up being a vigilante after he stopped The Ghost in 1955; later became a Doctor and Chief of Staff at Central City Hospital. When the Ghost reappears in 1990, Powell becomes Nightshade once again and teams up with the Flash to apprehend the Ghost. Later unknowingly inspires the '''Deadly Nightshade'''; is framed for multiple counts of murder, but clears his name and captures the impostor. Makes his secret identity public and becomes a celebrity.\n* Wesley Dodds appeared in the two-hour special episode of ''[[Smallville]]'' entitled \"[[Absolute Justice]]\", portrayed by [[Ken Lawson]]. He was shown as being a member of the now-disbanded [[Justice Society of America]]. He is first seen dreaming about the death of the [[Star-Spangled Kid]], and after waking up he puts on his costume and stands in front of a mirror. Without warning, [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] appears and kills him. His body was found by Clark Kent with multiple stab wounds in his chest.\n* Sandman's helmet appears in [[Rip Hunter]]'s office in ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''.\n\n====Animated====\n* In the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"Crisis 22,300 Miles Above Earth!\", Wesley Dodds helps out the Justice Society of America and the Justice League in the battle against [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s men. The other Sandman, Sandy Hawkins, is seen in the background of one of the scenes in the Watchtower.\n* Sandman makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode \"Humanity\". He is shown with the other members of the JSA during a flashback sequence.\n* Sandman can be seen being graduated in the ''[[DC Superhero Girls]]'' episode \"Welcome to Super Hero High\".\n\n===Film===\n* A [[Crime Syndicate of America]] version Sandman briefly appeared in ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]''.\n* Sandman can be seen among Grifter and Lois Lane battling Amazons and Atlantians in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]''.\n\n===Video games===\n* In the video game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Wesley Dodds' costume is seen in the background of the Hall of Justice, alongside [[Dr. Fate]], [[Dr. Mid-Nite]] and [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Jack Kirby bibliography]]\n*[[Sandman (comics)]] lists other comic book characters with the same name\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=sandman DCU Guide: Sandman Wesley Dodds]\n*[http://toonopedia.com/sandman2.htm Sandman (1974)] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

He [[first appearance|first appear]]ed in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #20 (October 1938). He is sometimes depicted as one of the first masked heroes within the fictional [[DC Universe]]. He is also known as a founding member of DC\u2019s second depicted superhero team, [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Lee Walter Travis===\n\nThe Crimson Avenger (along with his sidekick Wing) first appeared in the [[DC Comics]] [[anthology]] [[American comic book]] series ''[[Detective Comics]]'' in issue #20. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Booker |first1=M.

This inspired him to return to America and combat crime, first as a corruption-free newspaper owner and later as a masked crime fighter.\n\nIn his costumed identity, Travis used both conventional handguns and a special pistol that dispensed a bright red smokescreen.\n\nYears later, Travis came down with a rare incurable terminal illness. However, Travis managed to meet an end of his own choosing when he died rescuing his city from an explosives-laden freighter about to detonate in its harbor; after convincing the crew to abandon ship, he piloted the ship to a safe distance before it exploded.<ref>''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #38</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last = Wells|first = John|title = Flashback: Whatever Happened to...?|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 64|pages = 51\u201361|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = May 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Justice League of America always has a version of his first costume present whenever they are inducting new members as a homage to the Crimson Avenger's status as the world's first masked crimefighter. Superman, by comparison. was the first superhero and the world's first unmasked crimefighter, making his first appearance in June 1938 in ''Action Comics'' #1.\n\n===Albert Elwood===\nAlbert Elwood made a single appearance as the Crimson Avenger, in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #131 (February 1963), in a story entitled \"The Mystery of the Crimson Avenger\". Eccentric inventor Albert Elwood adopted the guise and attempted to help Superman, Batman and Robin thwart the robberies of the Octopus Gang. A requisite identity confusion occurs when one of the Gang members assumed the Crimson Avenger's identity. Elwood helped the heroes capture the gang and retired right afterward. He had many sophisticated gadgets, but his efforts often proved counterproductive, more a hindrance than a help. Elwood did mention that he had \"taken the name of a former lawman,\" meaning the by-then long defunct original Crimson Avenger.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume Three: Superman |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=1-4012-1389-8 |page=48}}</ref>\n\nAfter the introduction of the DC Comics multiverse in the 1960s, the original Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis) was explained to have lived on Earth-Two; Albert Elwood's Earth has never been specified.\n\n===Jill Carlyle===\n[[File:CrimsonAvengerIII.jpg|thumb|right|Jill Carlyle, the third Crimson Avenger]]\nA female Crimson Avenger appeared later who, like the original [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]], served as a minor [[Spectre (comics)|Spirit of Vengeance]]. She was an African-American woman who possessed the powers of teleportation and intangibility. In a flashback sequence, it was revealed that Carlyle studied law but apparently lost a case in which the defendant was clearly guilty. She obtained a pair of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] pistols originally owned by the first Crimson Avenger and used them to exact vengeance upon the unknown criminal. These guns are cursed such that, if the possessor uses them out of revenge, he or she will be cursed to track and kill those who have taken innocent life. Carlyle becomes the Crimsom Avenger after taking revenge on the unknown own criminal and, also as part of the curse, an ever-bleeding bullet hole appears on her chest.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Crimson Avenger II | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 90 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>\n\nUpon gaining a new \"assignment,\" she mentally relives the death of the victim, and then is teleported to their place of burial. Carlyle then gains the memory and skills of those whose deaths she is avenging. Also, her guns never miss, never run out of ammunition, and have no triggers. The bullets are capable of penetrating any substance, and can wound invulnerable heroes such as [[Superman]] and [[Power Girl]], as well as crack the armored shell of [[Captain Atom]]. The guns seemingly have a mind of their own, as Carlyle speaks of having to restrain them from shooting those who come between her and her target. Her intangibility does not function against her own weapons or other magical forces. Unless/until the curse is lifted, Carlyle is seemingly immortal. She once attemptef to kill herself with her own weapons, but this merely resulted in ending her current \"assignment\" and delivering her to the next one.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nShe was a member of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] during the \"Stealing Thunder\" storyline - the group at the time being short on heroes after the [[Ultra-Humanite]] used the [[Johnny Thunder|Thunderbolt]] to take over the world. Her mission was to avenge the death of Lee Travis, revealing that the explosion that killed him was actually caused by the Ultra-Humanite. Carlyle returned later in ''JSA'' #52-53, tracking down [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] for framing a man called Charles Durham for a crime he didn't commit. She learned however that Wildcat only framed Durham after Durham killed his brother, sister-in-law and nephew as revenge for his own brother killing his fianc\u00e9e. Durham was innocent of the crime he was convicted for, but Wildcat only framed him for the death of his fianc\u00e9e because he couldn't prove Durham had killed his brother's family. Realizing that she was not always contacted by the spirits of the innocent, the Avenger attempted to escape her duty by shooting herself. She argued that she had already taken two of Wildcat's nine lives and hence punished him for his 'crime', but found herself simply moving on to her next target.\n\nThough attacked by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] in a 2005 issue of ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'', the Crimson Avenger is seen at Blackgate Prison, fighting escaping inmates during the worldwide supervillain breakout the Society engineered in ''[[Villains United]]: [[Infinite Crisis]] Special'' #1. The Crimson Avenger later appears, alongside the current [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] and [[Wild Dog (comics)|Wild Dog]], on a rooftop in the great [[Battle of Metropolis]], raining bullets down on the [[Trigger Twins]], the [[Madmen (DC Comics)|Madmen]] and [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]].<ref>''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7</ref> She aldo appears as one of the dozens of heroes and villains kidnapped by aliens in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #842 and 843 before being freed by other heroes.\n\nCarlule is later seen gunning down the supervillain known as Catalyst after [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]] sends random super-criminals to attack the world's heroes in order to distract them from his master plan.<ref>''Justice League: Cry For Justice'' #5</ref>\n\nThis version of the Crimson Avenger is referred to by fans as Jill Carlyle, a name taken from the headstone of a victim the character was shown avenging in an early appearance. Whether the Avenger is Carlyle herself or not remains unclear. Following DC Comics' 2011 [[The New 52|reboot of their publishing line]], a similar character appears in the series ''[[Earth-Two|Earth-2]]'' under the name Lee Travis.\n\n==Other versions==\n\nIn issue #33 of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' comic book, the Avenger has a starring role, alongside [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]]. This incarnation of the Avenger is much older than most of his Justice League teammates, but not so old that he could have operated in the 1930s (he looks to be in his 50's.) He has no powers but is a skilled detective and an excellent shot with his twin pistols.\n\nIn Michael Uslan's [[Elseworlds]] title ''Batman: Detective No. 27'', the Crimson Avenger appears as part of an order of detectives including [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and [[Sam Spade]] and attempts to recruit [[Bruce Wayne]].\n\nIn ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', the Crimson Avenger is briefly mentioned as having met with [[Allan Quatermain]] and [[Mina Harker|Mina Murray]] during the two's self-exile from Britain during the years of the [[Ingsoc]] government. A photo of Allan and Murray standing in front of the Crimson Avenger's second costume is shown.\n\nThe Crimson Avenger makes an appearance in the ''[[Justice League of America]] [[80-Page Giant]] #1'' comic (November 2009) in a story titled ''[[Zatanna]] & [[Black Canary]] in Fishnet Femmes Fatales!'', when the two heroines are tossed back in time by the supervillain [[Epoch (DC Comics)|Epoch]].\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', [[Alex Ross]] portrayed the character as a giant demon imprisoned in the Gulag. Naming him \"King Crimson\" in a nod to the band of the same name, his look owes more to his standard superhero look than his previous pulp fiction costume.\n\nIn the pages of ''[[L.E.G.I.O.N.]]'', Garv assumed a masked identity after quitting the team, calling himself the Crimson Avenger. He dropped the identity when he returned to the team near the end of the series.\n\nIn ''Blue Griffin Comics'', a short lived comic endeavor, the forerunner super hero was to be named Crimson Avenger. His suit was more closely related to typical super hero style with bright red boots, gloves, trunks, and cape; while the rest of his outfit and mask were a darker shade of red. He sported a \"C\" crest on his chest and had energy manipulation powers similar to the Green Lantern, however he could not turn his energy projections into objects.\n\n==In other media==\nThe Lee Travis version of Crimson Avenger is a member of the Justice League in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and has several short, non-speaking appearances aside from a very minor one in the episode \"[[This Little Piggy]]\", where he is voiced by an uncredited [[Kevin Conroy]] (the voice of [[Batman]]). He also appeared in the episode \"Patriot Act\" as one of the reinforcements sent to help Green Arrow. For specific information on Crimson's Avenger's appearances on'' Justice League Unlimited, ''see [[Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis)#In other media]].\n\nIn ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', the Crimson Avenger is briefly mentioned as having met with [[Allan Quatermain]] and [[Mina Harker|Mina Murray]] during their self-exile from Britain during the years of the [[Ingsoc]] government.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.is/20130121072630/http://www.dcindexes.com/indexes/indexes.php?character=10 Earth-2 Crimson Avenger (Travis) Index]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011420/http://www.infiniteearths.org/dcu/whoswho_files/CrmAvn2B.htm Who's Who: Crimson Avenger (Elwood)]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The character Tex Thompson was debuted by Ken Fitch and Bernard Baily.

She was an African-American woman who possessed the powers of teleportation and intangibility. In a flashback sequence, it was revealed that Carlyle studied law but apparently lost a case in which the defendant was clearly guilty. She obtained a pair of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] pistols originally owned by the first Crimson Avenger and used them to exact vengeance upon the unknown criminal. These guns are cursed such that, if the possessor uses them out of revenge, he or she will be cursed to track and kill those who have taken innocent life. Carlyle becomes the Crimsom Avenger after taking revenge on the unknown own criminal and, also as part of the curse, an ever-bleeding bullet hole appears on her chest.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Crimson Avenger II | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 90 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>\n\nUpon gaining a new \"assignment,\" she mentally relives the death of the victim, and then is teleported to their place of burial. Carlyle then gains the memory and skills of those whose deaths she is avenging. Also, her guns never miss, never run out of ammunition, and have no triggers. The bullets are capable of penetrating any substance, and can wound invulnerable heroes such as [[Superman]] and [[Power Girl]], as well as crack the armored shell of [[Captain Atom]]. The guns seemingly have a mind of their own, as Carlyle speaks of having to restrain them from shooting those who come between her and her target. Her intangibility does not function against her own weapons or other magical forces. Unless/until the curse is lifted, Carlyle is seemingly immortal. She once attemptef to kill herself with her own weapons, but this merely resulted in ending her current \"assignment\" and delivering her to the next one.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nShe was a member of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] during the \"Stealing Thunder\" storyline - the group at the time being short on heroes after the [[Ultra-Humanite]] used the [[Johnny Thunder|Thunderbolt]] to take over the world. Her mission was to avenge the death of Lee Travis, revealing that the explosion that killed him was actually caused by the Ultra-Humanite. Carlyle returned later in ''JSA'' #52-53, tracking down [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] for framing a man called Charles Durham for a crime he didn't commit. She learned however that Wildcat only framed Durham after Durham killed his brother, sister-in-law and nephew as revenge for his own brother killing his fianc\u00e9e. Durham was innocent of the crime he was convicted for, but Wildcat only framed him for the death of his fianc\u00e9e because he couldn't prove Durham had killed his brother's family. Realizing that she was not always contacted by the spirits of the innocent, the Avenger attempted to escape her duty by shooting herself. She argued that she had already taken two of Wildcat's nine lives and hence punished him for his 'crime', but found herself simply moving on to her next target.\n\nThough attacked by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] in a 2005 issue of ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'', the Crimson Avenger is seen at Blackgate Prison, fighting escaping inmates during the worldwide supervillain breakout the Society engineered in ''[[Villains United]]: [[Infinite Crisis]] Special'' #1. The Crimson Avenger later appears, alongside the current [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] and [[Wild Dog (comics)|Wild Dog]], on a rooftop in the great [[Battle of Metropolis]], raining bullets down on the [[Trigger Twins]], the [[Madmen (DC Comics)|Madmen]] and [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]].<ref>''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7</ref> She aldo appears as one of the dozens of heroes and villains kidnapped by aliens in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #842 and 843 before being freed by other heroes.\n\nCarlule is later seen gunning down the supervillain known as Catalyst after [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]] sends random super-criminals to attack the world's heroes in order to distract them from his master plan.<ref>''Justice League: Cry For Justice'' #5</ref>\n\nThis version of the Crimson Avenger is referred to by fans as Jill Carlyle, a name taken from the headstone of a victim the character was shown avenging in an early appearance. Whether the Avenger is Carlyle herself or not remains unclear. Following DC Comics' 2011 [[The New 52|reboot of their publishing line]], a similar character appears in the series ''[[Earth-Two|Earth-2]]'' under the name Lee Travis.\n\n==Other versions==\n\nIn issue #33 of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' comic book, the Avenger has a starring role, alongside [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]]. This incarnation of the Avenger is much older than most of his Justice League teammates, but not so old that he could have operated in the 1930s (he looks to be in his 50's.) He has no powers but is a skilled detective and an excellent shot with his twin pistols.\n\nIn Michael Uslan's [[Elseworlds]] title ''Batman: Detective No. 27'', the Crimson Avenger appears as part of an order of detectives including [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and [[Sam Spade]] and attempts to recruit [[Bruce Wayne]].\n\nIn ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', the Crimson Avenger is briefly mentioned as having met with [[Allan Quatermain]] and [[Mina Harker|Mina Murray]] during the two's self-exile from Britain during the years of the [[Ingsoc]] government. A photo of Allan and Murray standing in front of the Crimson Avenger's second costume is shown.\n\nThe Crimson Avenger makes an appearance in the ''[[Justice League of America]] [[80-Page Giant]] #1'' comic (November 2009) in a story titled ''[[Zatanna]] & [[Black Canary]] in Fishnet Femmes Fatales!'', when the two heroines are tossed back in time by the supervillain [[Epoch (DC Comics)|Epoch]].\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', [[Alex Ross]] portrayed the character as a giant demon imprisoned in the Gulag. Naming him \"King Crimson\" in a nod to the band of the same name, his look owes more to his standard superhero look than his previous pulp fiction costume.\n\nIn the pages of ''[[L.E.G.I.O.N.]]'', Garv assumed a masked identity after quitting the team, calling himself the Crimson Avenger. He dropped the identity when he returned to the team near the end of the series.\n\nIn ''Blue Griffin Comics'', a short lived comic endeavor, the forerunner super hero was to be named Crimson Avenger. His suit was more closely related to typical super hero style with bright red boots, gloves, trunks, and cape; while the rest of his outfit and mask were a darker shade of red. He sported a \"C\" crest on his chest and had energy manipulation powers similar to the Green Lantern, however he could not turn his energy projections into objects.\n\n==In other media==\nThe Lee Travis version of Crimson Avenger is a member of the Justice League in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and has several short, non-speaking appearances aside from a very minor one in the episode \"[[This Little Piggy]]\", where he is voiced by an uncredited [[Kevin Conroy]] (the voice of [[Batman]]). He also appeared in the episode \"Patriot Act\" as one of the reinforcements sent to help Green Arrow. For specific information on Crimson's Avenger's appearances on'' Justice League Unlimited, ''see [[Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis)#In other media]].\n\nIn ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', the Crimson Avenger is briefly mentioned as having met with [[Allan Quatermain]] and [[Mina Harker|Mina Murray]] during their self-exile from Britain during the years of the [[Ingsoc]] government.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.is/20130121072630/http://www.dcindexes.com/indexes/indexes.php?character=10 Earth-2 Crimson Avenger (Travis) Index]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011420/http://www.infiniteearths.org/dcu/whoswho_files/CrmAvn2B.htm Who's Who: Crimson Avenger (Elwood)]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The character Tex Thompson was debuted by Ken Fitch and Bernard Baily.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011.

Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

A feasibility report to Line 6\u2014the second Hankou-Hanyang connection\u2014was also approved by the NDRC on December 21, 2012. Seven days later, line 2 entered revenue service, connecting some of the most populated areas of Hankou, Wuchang, and the [[Optics Valley of China|Optics Valley]].\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the NDRC granted acceptance to a feasibility report of Line 8, phase 1, which connects Hankou and Wuchang via the [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Yangtze River Bridge]] corridor.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011.

Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

A feasibility report to Line 6\u2014the second Hankou-Hanyang connection\u2014was also approved by the NDRC on December 21, 2012. Seven days later, line 2 entered revenue service, connecting some of the most populated areas of Hankou, Wuchang, and the [[Optics Valley of China|Optics Valley]].\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the NDRC granted acceptance to a feasibility report of Line 8, phase 1, which connects Hankou and Wuchang via the [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Yangtze River Bridge]] corridor.
