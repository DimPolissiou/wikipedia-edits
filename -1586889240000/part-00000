Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations,<ref name=TaylorJamiesonWallis></ref> although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.\n\n==South Island robins and 1080 poison==\n\nA number of robin deaths have been recorded as a result of accidental [[sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] poisoning following pest control operations.<ref name=Spurr>{{cite book|last=Spurr|first=E.|year=2000|chapter=Impacts of possum control on non-target species|editor=T.L.

Incubation lasts 18 days, and chicks leave the nest after 21 days. Five to 25 days after fledglings leave the nest, the pair may breed again.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=PowleslandB>{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations,<ref name=TaylorJamiesonWallis></ref> although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.\n\n==South Island robins and 1080 poison==\n\nA number of robin deaths have been recorded as a result of accidental [[sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] poisoning following pest control operations.<ref name=Spurr>{{cite book|last=Spurr|first=E.|year=2000|chapter=Impacts of possum control on non-target species|editor=T.L.

Temperate climates are rare across the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes. In fact, the climate of Africa is more variable by rainfall amount than by temperatures, which are consistently high. African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent, owing to the prevailing presence of the [[subtropical ridge]] with subsiding, hot, dry air masses. Africa holds many heat-related records: the continent has the hottest extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, the highest sunshine duration, and more.\n\nOwing to Africa's position across equatorial and subtropical latitudes in both the northern and southern hemisphere, several different climate types can be found within it. The continent mainly lies within the [[tropical climate zone|intertropical zone]] between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], hence its interesting density of humidity. Precipitation intensity is always high, and it is a hot continent. Warm and hot climates prevail all over Africa,  but mostly the northern part is marked by aridity and high temperatures. Only the northernmost and the southernmost fringes of the continent have a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The equator runs through the middle of Africa, as do the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, making Africa the most tropical continent.\n\n==Temperatures==\n{{See also|Subtropical ridge}}\n[[File: Africa temperature.png|thumb|left|Monthly mean and minimum outdoor and indoor temperatures throughout Africa]]\nGlobally, heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the [[monsoon trough]] or [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. The divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft. As it moves towards the Mid-Latitudes, the air cools and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres. This circulation is known as the [[Hadley cell]] and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.<ref>Dr. Owen E. Thompson (1996).

Temperate climates are rare across the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes. In fact, the climate of Africa is more variable by rainfall amount than by temperatures, which are consistently high. African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent, owing to the prevailing presence of the [[subtropical ridge]] with subsiding, hot, dry air masses. Africa holds many heat-related records: the continent has the hottest extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, the highest sunshine duration, and more.\n\nOwing to Africa's position across equatorial and subtropical latitudes in both the northern and southern hemisphere, several different climate types can be found within it. The continent mainly lies within the [[tropical climate zone|intertropical zone]] between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], hence its interesting density of humidity. Precipitation intensity is always high, and it is a hot continent. Warm and hot climates prevail all over Africa,  but mostly the northern part is marked by aridity and high temperatures. Only the northernmost and the southernmost fringes of the continent have a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The equator runs through the middle of Africa, as do the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, making Africa the most tropical continent.\n\n==Temperatures==\n{{See also|Subtropical ridge}}\n[[File: Africa temperature.png|thumb|left|Monthly mean and minimum outdoor and indoor temperatures throughout Africa]]\nGlobally, heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the [[monsoon trough]] or [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. The divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft. As it moves towards the Mid-Latitudes, the air cools and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres. This circulation is known as the [[Hadley cell]] and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.<ref>Dr. Owen E. Thompson (1996).

First officer Hupp was the pilot flying. The flight was uneventful until it approached Toledo.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|1}} Flight 805 was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 07 with the controller advising the crew about light to moderate precipitation. At 03:02, Flight 805 was cleared to land, and captain Baker acknowledged the transmission. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) then recorded the flight crew going over the landing checklist. After this however, captain Baker started complaining to first officer Hupp that he was flying too slow with the flaps not having been extended into the landing configuration. He even told him, \"You\u2019re not even on the [expletive] localizer at all.\" In other words, the aircraft had failed to capture the localizer and was below the glide path, resulting in an unstable approach. Baker subsequently declared a go-around at 03:13.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|2}}\n\nWhen the approach controller asked Flight 805 on why they initiated go-around, captain Baker responded, \"We lost the localizer close in there...couldn\u2019t position ourselves on final...we had the glidepath, but not the localizer.\" The approach controller gave Flight 805 a 100 degree heading for another approach.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|2}}\n\nDuring the second approach the aircraft managed to capture the localizer, with captain Baker advising first officer Hupp about the wind conditions. At 03:21, Flight 805 was again cleared to land on runway 07. However, the approach became destabilized again, with the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) sounding three \"glideslope\" warnings and three \"sink rate\" warnings. There were also three changes in power. At 03:24, Baker told Hupp that he was taking over control of the aircraft and initiated another go-around.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|3}}\n\nAt 03:25, first officer Hupp reported the go-around to the tower controller and were instructed to climb and maintain {{Convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=}} and then turn left onto a 300 degree heading. However the aircraft began to bank 80 degrees and pitch up 25 degrees. Captain Baker transferred control of the aircraft back to first officer Hupp and asked him if he had the control, to which he responded, \"I got it.\" Hupp then attempted to raise the aircraft's nose and level the wings, but was unable to recover control. At 03:26 the aircraft crashed into the ground {{Convert|3|mi|km nmi|abbr=}} away from runway 07. All four people on board were killed, and the aircraft was destroyed. There were no fatalities or injuries on the ground.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|3}}\n\n== Investigation ==\nDuring the National Transportation Safety Board investigation both flight recorders were recovered. Investigators discovered that when the captain took control, he became spatially disoriented and accidentally caused the plane to enter an unrecoverable bank and attitude. The NTSB also focused on the aircraft's [[Attitude indicator|Attude indicators (ADI)]], human factors, the power changes by using the Flight Data Recorder (FDR), and the manner of the first officer's approach.\n\nThe ADI malfunction was the most likely scenario, as the NTSB was unable to determine its readings at impact. The NTSB alluded to previous accidents which involved ADI malfunctions.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|36\u201338}} However at the same time, the NTSB could not determine if the ADIs on Flight 805 had malfunctioned or not, as only one ADI was recovered.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|35}} The first officer's actions just before impact might have been able to recover the plane, had the first officer been more \"aggressive\" with the controls.

First officer Hupp was the pilot flying. The flight was uneventful until it approached Toledo.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|1}} Flight 805 was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 07 with the controller advising the crew about light to moderate precipitation. At 03:02, Flight 805 was cleared to land, and captain Baker acknowledged the transmission. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) then recorded the flight crew going over the landing checklist. After this however, captain Baker started complaining to first officer Hupp that he was flying too slow with the flaps not having been extended into the landing configuration. He even told him, \"You\u2019re not even on the [expletive] localizer at all.\" In other words, the aircraft had failed to capture the localizer and was below the glide path, resulting in an unstable approach. Baker subsequently declared a go-around at 03:13.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|2}}\n\nWhen the approach controller asked Flight 805 on why they initiated go-around, captain Baker responded, \"We lost the localizer close in there...couldn\u2019t position ourselves on final...we had the glidepath, but not the localizer.\" The approach controller gave Flight 805 a 100 degree heading for another approach.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|2}}\n\nDuring the second approach the aircraft managed to capture the localizer, with captain Baker advising first officer Hupp about the wind conditions. At 03:21, Flight 805 was again cleared to land on runway 07. However, the approach became destabilized again, with the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) sounding three \"glideslope\" warnings and three \"sink rate\" warnings. There were also three changes in power. At 03:24, Baker told Hupp that he was taking over control of the aircraft and initiated another go-around.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|3}}\n\nAt 03:25, first officer Hupp reported the go-around to the tower controller and were instructed to climb and maintain {{Convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=}} and then turn left onto a 300 degree heading. However the aircraft began to bank 80 degrees and pitch up 25 degrees. Captain Baker transferred control of the aircraft back to first officer Hupp and asked him if he had the control, to which he responded, \"I got it.\" Hupp then attempted to raise the aircraft's nose and level the wings, but was unable to recover control. At 03:26 the aircraft crashed into the ground {{Convert|3|mi|km nmi|abbr=}} away from runway 07. All four people on board were killed, and the aircraft was destroyed. There were no fatalities or injuries on the ground.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|3}}\n\n== Investigation ==\nDuring the National Transportation Safety Board investigation both flight recorders were recovered. Investigators discovered that when the captain took control, he became spatially disoriented and accidentally caused the plane to enter an unrecoverable bank and attitude. The NTSB also focused on the aircraft's [[Attitude indicator|Attude indicators (ADI)]], human factors, the power changes by using the Flight Data Recorder (FDR), and the manner of the first officer's approach.\n\nThe ADI malfunction was the most likely scenario, as the NTSB was unable to determine its readings at impact. The NTSB alluded to previous accidents which involved ADI malfunctions.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|36\u201338}} However at the same time, the NTSB could not determine if the ADIs on Flight 805 had malfunctioned or not, as only one ADI was recovered.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|35}} The first officer's actions just before impact might have been able to recover the plane, had the first officer been more \"aggressive\" with the controls.

According to [[Amnesty International]]'s 2010 report, five medical conditions collectively account for 74% of maternal deaths in the US.\n\n# '''[[Embolism]]''': blood vessels blocked likely due to deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, commonly in the legs but could be from other deep veins.* Pulmonary embolisms and strokes are blockages in the lungs and brain respectively and are severe, could lead to long term effects, or be fatal.\n# '''[[Hemorrhage]]''': severe bleeding. Hemorrhages can be caused by placenta accreta, increta, and percreta, uterine rupture, ectopic pregnancy, uterine atony, retained products of conception, and tearing. During labor, it is common to lose between half a quart to a quart depending on whether a mother delivers naturally or by cesarean section. With the additional and severe amount of bleeding due to hemorrhage, the mother\u2019s internal organs could go into shock due to poor blood flow which is fatal.\n# '''[[Pre-eclampsia]]''': at about 20 weeks until after delivery, pregnant women could have an increase in blood pressure which could indicate pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia involves the liver and kidneys not working properly which is indicated by protein in the urine as well as having hypertension. Pre-eclampsia can also become eclampsia, the mother seizes or is in a coma, which is rare but fatal. \n# [[Infection|'''Infection''':]] each person has a different immune system, when a woman is pregnant, their immune systems behaves different than originally causing increased susceptibility to infection which can be threatening to both mother and baby. Different types of infection include, infection of amniotic fluid and surrounding tissues, influenza, genital tract infections, and sepsis/blood infection. Fever, chills, abnormal heart rate, and breathing rate can indicate some form of infection. \n# '''[[Cardiomyopathy]]'''<sup>[18]</sup>: the enlargement of heart, increased thickness, and possible rigidness which causes the heart to weaken and die. This may lead to low blood pressure, reduced heart function, and heart failure.

According to [[Amnesty International]]'s 2010 report, five medical conditions collectively account for 74% of maternal deaths in the US.\n\n# '''[[Embolism]]''': blood vessels blocked likely due to deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, commonly in the legs but could be from other deep veins.* Pulmonary embolisms and strokes are blockages in the lungs and brain respectively and are severe, could lead to long term effects, or be fatal.\n# '''[[Hemorrhage]]''': severe bleeding. Hemorrhages can be caused by placenta accreta, increta, and percreta, uterine rupture, ectopic pregnancy, uterine atony, retained products of conception, and tearing. During labor, it is common to lose between half a quart to a quart depending on whether a mother delivers naturally or by cesarean section. With the additional and severe amount of bleeding due to hemorrhage, the mother\u2019s internal organs could go into shock due to poor blood flow which is fatal.\n# '''[[Pre-eclampsia]]''': at about 20 weeks until after delivery, pregnant women could have an increase in blood pressure which could indicate pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia involves the liver and kidneys not working properly which is indicated by protein in the urine as well as having hypertension. Pre-eclampsia can also become eclampsia, the mother seizes or is in a coma, which is rare but fatal. \n# [[Infection|'''Infection''':]] each person has a different immune system, when a woman is pregnant, their immune systems behaves different than originally causing increased susceptibility to infection which can be threatening to both mother and baby. Different types of infection include, infection of amniotic fluid and surrounding tissues, influenza, genital tract infections, and sepsis/blood infection. Fever, chills, abnormal heart rate, and breathing rate can indicate some form of infection. \n# '''[[Cardiomyopathy]]'''<sup>[18]</sup>: the enlargement of heart, increased thickness, and possible rigidness which causes the heart to weaken and die.

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis). By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus. Researchers concluded in late February that \"the virus had probably been [[Transmission (medicine)|spreading]] for weeks\" person-to-person. Sometime after February 24, the CDC directs states to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally.<ref name=\"NYT_Test1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html|title=The Lost Month:How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19|date=March 28, 2020|via=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\n====January 21-31====\n[[File:Donald Trump Coronavirus briefing.jpg|thumb|President [[Donald Trump]] received a briefing on the coronavirus on January 29, 2020.|alt=]]\n\nThe first reported case in the U.S. was in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] on January 21, 2020, which affected a man who had returned from [[Wuhan]], China.

On January 3, the CDC Director Robert Redfield was notified by a counterpart in China that a \"mysterious respiratory illness was spreading in Wuhan [China]\". Redfield notified HHS Secretary [[Alex Azar]] shortly thereafter, who shared his report with the [[National Security Council]] (NSC).

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis), then later to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally. By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus. Researchers concluded in late February that \"the virus had probably been [[Transmission (medicine)|spreading]] for weeks\" person-to-person.<ref name=\"NYT_Test1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html|title=The Lost Month:How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19|date=March 28, 2020|via=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\n====January 21-31====\n[[File:Donald Trump Coronavirus briefing.jpg|thumb|President [[Donald Trump]] received a briefing on the coronavirus on January 29, 2020.|alt=]]\n\nThe first reported case in the U.S. was in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] on January 21, 2020, which affected a man who had returned from [[Wuhan]], China.

By the third week of February, the group had \"effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation\" such as NPI's. This was based on the \"realization that many people in the country were likely infected and capable of spreading the disease, but not showing any symptoms.\"  For instance, by the time of the European travel ban on March 11 (a containment strategy), the group considered such containment steps ineffective.

After earning a [[bachelor's degree]], he returned to Arnhem in 1871 to teach night school classes in mathematics, but he continued his studies in [[Leiden]] in addition to his teaching position.  In 1875, Lorentz earned a [[doctoral degree]] under [[Pieter Rijke]] on a thesis entitled ''\"{{lang|nl|Over de theorie der terugkaatsing en breking van het licht}}\"'' (On the theory of reflection and refraction of light), in which he refined the electromagnetic theory of [[James Clerk Maxwell]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Hendrik Lorentz |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Lorentz_1875.pdf |title=Over de theorie der terugkaatsing en breking van het licht  |year=1875}}</ref>\n\n===Career===\n\n====Professor in Leiden====\nOn 17 November 1877, only 24 years of age, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz was appointed to the newly established chair in theoretical physics at the [[University of Leiden]].

After that, he extended his research to a much wider area while still focusing on theoretical physics. Lorentz made significant contributions to fields ranging from [[hydrodynamics]] to [[general relativity]]. His most important contributions were in the area of electromagnetism, the electron theory, and relativity.<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\nLorentz theorized that [[atom]]s might consist of charged particles and suggested that the oscillations of these charged particles were the source of light. When a colleague and former student of Lorentz's, [[Pieter Zeeman]], discovered the [[Zeeman effect]] in 1896, Lorentz supplied its theoretical interpretation. The experimental and theoretical work was honored with the Nobel prize in physics in 1902. Lorentz' name is now associated with the [[Lorentz-Lorenz]] formula, the [[Lorentz force]], the [[Lorentzian distribution]], and the [[Lorentz transformation]].\n\n====Electrodynamics and relativity====\n{{Main|Lorentz ether theory|History of special relativity|History of Lorentz transformations#Lorentz1|History of Lorentz transformations#Lorentz2}}\n\nIn 1892 and 1895, Lorentz worked on describing electromagnetic phenomena (the propagation of light) in reference frames that move relative to the postulated [[luminiferous aether]].<ref>{{Citation\n|author=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon\n|year=1892\n|title=La Th\u00e9orie electromagn\u00e9tique de Maxwell et son application aux corps mouvants\n|url = https://archive.org/details/lathorielectrom00loregoog\n|journal=Archives N\u00e9erlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles\n|volume=25\n|pages=363\u2013552}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n|author=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon\n|year=1895\n|title=Versuch einer Theorie der electrischen und optischen Erscheinungen in bewegten K\u00f6rpern\n|location=Leiden\n|publisher=E.J.

It would be impossible to decide which of them moves or stands still with respect to the ether, and there would be no reason for preferring the times and lengths measured by the one to those determined by the other, nor for saying that either of them is in possession of the \"true\" times or the \"true\" lengths. This is a point which Einstein has laid particular stress on, in a theory in which he starts from what he calls the principle of relativity, [...] I cannot speak here of the many highly interesting applications which Einstein has made of this principle. His results concerning electromagnetic and optical phenomena ... agree in the main with those which we have obtained in the preceding pages, the chief difference being that Einstein simply postulates what we have deduced, with some difficulty and not altogether satisfactorily, from the fundamental equations of the electromagnetic field. By doing so, he may certainly take credit for making us see in the negative result of experiments like those of Michelson, Rayleigh and Brace, not a fortuitous compensation of opposing effects, but the manifestation of a general and fundamental principle. [...] It would be unjust not to add that, besides the fascinating boldness of its starting point, Einstein's theory has another marked advantage over mine. Whereas I have not been able to obtain for the equations referred to moving axes ''exactly'' the same form as for those which apply to a stationary system, Einstein has accomplished this by means of a system of new variables slightly different from those which I have introduced.}}\n\nThough Lorentz still maintained that there is an (undetectable) aether in which resting clocks indicate the \"true time\":\n\n{{Quote|1909: Yet, I think, something may also be claimed in favour of the form in which I have presented the theory. I cannot but regard the ether, which can be the seat of an electromagnetic field with its energy and its vibrations, as endowed with a certain degree of substantiality, however different it may be from all ordinary matter.<ref name=lor09 /><br /> 1910: Provided that there is an aether, then under all systems x, y, z, t, one is preferred by the fact, that the coordinate axes as well as the clocks are resting in the aether. If one connects with this the idea (which I would abandon only reluctantly) that space and time are completely different things, and that there is a \"true time\" (simultaneity thus would be independent of the location, in agreement with the circumstance that we can have the idea of infinitely great velocities), then it can be easily seen that this true time should be indicated by clocks at rest in the aether. However, if the relativity principle had general validity in nature, one wouldn't be in the position to determine, whether the reference system just used is the preferred one. Then one comes to the same results, as if one (following Einstein and Minkowski) deny the existence of the aether and of true time, and to see all reference systems as equally valid.

Instead Lorentz appointed [[Paul Ehrenfest]] as his successor in the chair of theoretical  physics at the Leiden University, who would found the Institute for Theoretical Physics which would become known as the [[Lorentz Institute]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\n====Civil work====\nAfter World War I, Lorentz was one of the driving forces behind the founding of the \"Wetenschappelijke Commissie van Advies en Onderzoek in het Belang van Volkswelvaart en Weerbaarheid\", a committee which was to harness the scientific potential united in the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW) for solving civil problems such as food shortage which had resulted from the war. Lorentz was appointed chair of the committee. However, despite the best efforts of many of the participants the committee would harvest little success. The only exception being that it ultimately resulted in the founding of TNO, the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\nLorentz was also asked by the Dutch government to chair a committee to calculate some of the effects of the proposed [[Afsluitdijk]] (Enclosure Dam) flood control dam on water levels in the [[Waddenzee]]. [[Hydraulic engineering]] was mainly an empirical science at that time, but the disturbance of the tidal flow caused by the Afsluitdijk was so unprecedented that the empirical rules could not be trusted. Originally Lorentz was only supposed to have a coordinating role in the committee, but it quickly became apparent that Lorentz was the only physicist to have any fundamental traction on the problem. In the period 1918 till 1926, Lorentz invested a large portion of his time in the problem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/lorentz-the-grand-old-man-of-physics/|title=Lorentz: the Grand Old Man of Physics|date=March 13, 2000}}</ref> Lorentz proposed to start from the basic [[hydrodynamic]] equations of motion and solve the problem numerically. This was feasible for a \"[[human computer]]\", because of the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the water flow in the [[Waddenzee]]. The Afsluitdijk was completed in 1932, and the predictions of Lorentz and his committee turned out to be remarkably accurate.<ref group=B>{{cite web|url=http://ilorentz.org/history/zuiderzee/zuiderzee.html |title=Carlo Beenakker |publisher=Ilorentz.org |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref><ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\nOne of the two sets of locks in the Afsluitdijk was named after him.\n\n===Family life===\nIn 1881, Lorentz married Aletta Catharina Kaiser. Her father was J.W. Kaiser, a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. He was the Director of the museum which later became the well-known [[Rijksmuseum]] (National Gallery). He also was the designer of the first postage stamps of The Netherlands.\n\nThere were two daughters, and one son from this marriage.\n\n[[Geertruida de Haas-Lorentz|Dr. Geertruida Luberta Lorentz]], the eldest daughter, was a physicist. She married Professor W.J. de Haas, who was the Director of the Cryogenic Laboratory at the University of Leiden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1902/lorentz/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1902|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nIn January 1928, Lorentz became seriously ill, and died shortly after on 4 February.<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/> The respect in which he was held in the Netherlands is apparent from [[Owen Willans Richardson]]'s description of his funeral:\n\n{{Quote|text=The funeral took place at Haarlem at noon on Friday, February 10.

Although steeped in his own investigation of the moment, he always seemed to have in his immediate grasp its ramifications into every corner of the universe. ... The singular clearness of his writings provides a striking reflection of his wonderful powers in this respect. .... He possessed and successfully employed the mental vivacity which is necessary to follow the interplay of discussion, the insight which is required to extract those statements which illuminate the real difficulties, and the wisdom to lead the discussion among fruitful channels, and he did this so skillfully that the process was hardly perceptible.<ref group=B name=richardson /></blockquote>\n\nM. J. Klein (1967) wrote of Lorentz's reputation in the 1920s:\n\n<blockquote>For many years physicists had always been eager \"to hear what Lorentz will say about it\" when a new theory was advanced, and, even at seventy-two, he did not disappoint them.<ref group=B name=Przibram/></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to the [[Nobel prize]], Lorentz received a great many honours for his outstanding work.

After that, he extended his research to a much wider area while still focusing on theoretical physics. Lorentz made significant contributions to fields ranging from [[hydrodynamics]] to [[general relativity]]. His most important contributions were in the area of electromagnetism, the electron theory, and relativity.<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\nLorentz theorized that [[atom]]s might consist of charged particles and suggested that the oscillations of these charged particles were the source of light. When a colleague and former student of Lorentz's, [[Pieter Zeeman]], discovered the [[Zeeman effect]] in 1896, Lorentz supplied its theoretical interpretation. The experimental and theoretical work was honored with the Nobel prize in physics in 1902.

The 1904 paper includes a detailed discussion of the increase of the inertial mass of rapidly moving objects in a useless attempt to make momentum look exactly like Newtonian momentum; it was also an attempt to explain the length contraction as the accumulation of \"stuff\" onto mass making it slow and contract.\n\n====Lorentz and special relativity====\n[[File:Einstein en Lorentz.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Einstein]] and Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, photographed by [[Paul Ehrenfest|Ehrenfest]] in front of his home in Leiden in 1921.]][[File:League of Nations Commission 067.tif|thumb|Lorentz (left) at the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] of the [[League of Nations]], here with [[Albert Einstein]].]]\n\nIn 1905, Einstein would use many of the concepts, mathematical tools and results Lorentz discussed to write his paper entitled \"[[Annus Mirabilis Papers#Special relativity|On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]]\",<ref>{{Citation\n|author=Einstein, Albert\n|year=1905\n|title=Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper\n|journal=Annalen der Physik\n|volume=322\n|issue=10\n|pages=891\u2013921\n|url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_891-921.pdf\n|doi=10.1002/andp.19053221004|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..891E }}.

It would be impossible to decide which of them moves or stands still with respect to the ether, and there would be no reason for preferring the times and lengths measured by the one to those determined by the other, nor for saying that either of them is in possession of the \"true\" times or the \"true\" lengths. This is a point which Einstein has laid particular stress on, in a theory in which he starts from what he calls the principle of relativity, [...] I cannot speak here of the many highly interesting applications which Einstein has made of this principle. His results concerning electromagnetic and optical phenomena ... agree in the main with those which we have obtained in the preceding pages, the chief difference being that Einstein simply postulates what we have deduced, with some difficulty and not altogether satisfactorily, from the fundamental equations of the electromagnetic field. By doing so, he may certainly take credit for making us see in the negative result of experiments like those of Michelson, Rayleigh and Brace, not a fortuitous compensation of opposing effects, but the manifestation of a general and fundamental principle. [...] It would be unjust not to add that, besides the fascinating boldness of its starting point, Einstein's theory has another marked advantage over mine. Whereas I have not been able to obtain for the equations referred to moving axes ''exactly'' the same form as for those which apply to a stationary system, Einstein has accomplished this by means of a system of new variables slightly different from those which I have introduced.}}\n\nThough Lorentz still maintained that there is an (undetectable) aether in which resting clocks indicate the \"true time\":\n\n{{Quote|1909: Yet, I think, something may also be claimed in favour of the form in which I have presented the theory. I cannot but regard the ether, which can be the seat of an electromagnetic field with its energy and its vibrations, as endowed with a certain degree of substantiality, however different it may be from all ordinary matter.<ref name=lor09 /><br /> 1910: Provided that there is an aether, then under all systems x, y, z, t, one is preferred by the fact, that the coordinate axes as well as the clocks are resting in the aether. If one connects with this the idea (which I would abandon only reluctantly) that space and time are completely different things, and that there is a \"true time\" (simultaneity thus would be independent of the location, in agreement with the circumstance that we can have the idea of infinitely great velocities), then it can be easily seen that this true time should be indicated by clocks at rest in the aether. However, if the relativity principle had general validity in nature, one wouldn't be in the position to determine, whether the reference system just used is the preferred one. Then one comes to the same results, as if one (following Einstein and Minkowski) deny the existence of the aether and of true time, and to see all reference systems as equally valid. Which of these two ways of thinking one is following, can surely be left to the individual.<ref name=lor10 />}}\n\nLorentz also gave credit to Poincar\u00e9's contributions to relativity.<ref>{{Citation\n|author=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon\n|year=1921|orig-year=1914\n|title=Deux M\u00e9moires de Henri Poincar\u00e9 sur la Physique Math\u00e9matique\n|journal=Acta Mathematica\n|volume=38\n|issue=1\n|pages=293\u2013308\n|doi=10.1007/BF02392073|title-link=s:fr:Deux M\u00e9moires de Henri Poincar\u00e9 sur la Physique Math\u00e9matique}}\n*English Wikisource translation: [[s:Translation:Two Papers of Henri Poincar\u00e9 on Mathematical Physics|Two Papers of Henri Poincar\u00e9 on Mathematical Physics]]</ref>\n\n{{Quote|Indeed, for some of the physical quantities which enter the formulas, I did not indicate the transformation which suits best.

No, it was the mechanics of Lorentz, the one dealing with the principle of relativity; the one which, hardly five years ago, seemed to be the height of boldness.}}\n\n====Change of priorities====\nIn 1910, Lorentz decided to reorganize his life.  His teaching and management duties at Leiden University were taking up too much of his time, leaving him little time for research. In 1912, he resigned from his chair of theoretical physics to become curator of the \"Physics Cabinet\" at [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]]. He remained connected to Leiden University  as an external professor, and his \"Monday morning lectures\" on new developments in theoretical physics soon became legendary.<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\nLorentz initially asked Einstein to succeed him as professor of theoretical physics at Leiden. However, Einstein could not accept because he had just accepted a position at [[ETH Zurich]]. Einstein had no regrets in this matter, since the prospect of having to fill Lorentz's shoes made him shiver. Instead Lorentz appointed [[Paul Ehrenfest]] as his successor in the chair of theoretical  physics at the Leiden University, who would found the Institute for Theoretical Physics which would become known as the [[Lorentz Institute]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\n====Civil work====\nAfter World War I, Lorentz was one of the driving forces behind the founding of the \"Wetenschappelijke Commissie van Advies en Onderzoek in het Belang van Volkswelvaart en Weerbaarheid\", a committee which was to harness the scientific potential united in the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW) for solving civil problems such as food shortage which had resulted from the war. Lorentz was appointed chair of the committee. However, despite the best efforts of many of the participants the committee would harvest little success. The only exception being that it ultimately resulted in the founding of TNO, the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]].<ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\n\nLorentz was also asked by the Dutch government to chair a committee to calculate some of the effects of the proposed [[Afsluitdijk]] (Enclosure Dam) flood control dam on water levels in the [[Waddenzee]]. [[Hydraulic engineering]] was mainly an empirical science at that time, but the disturbance of the tidal flow caused by the Afsluitdijk was so unprecedented that the empirical rules could not be trusted. Originally Lorentz was only supposed to have a coordinating role in the committee, but it quickly became apparent that Lorentz was the only physicist to have any fundamental traction on the problem. In the period 1918 till 1926, Lorentz invested a large portion of his time in the problem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/lorentz-the-grand-old-man-of-physics/|title=Lorentz: the Grand Old Man of Physics|date=March 13, 2000}}</ref> Lorentz proposed to start from the basic [[hydrodynamic]] equations of motion and solve the problem numerically. This was feasible for a \"[[human computer]]\", because of the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the water flow in the [[Waddenzee]]. The Afsluitdijk was completed in 1932, and the predictions of Lorentz and his committee turned out to be remarkably accurate.<ref group=B>{{cite web|url=http://ilorentz.org/history/zuiderzee/zuiderzee.html |title=Carlo Beenakker |publisher=Ilorentz.org |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref><ref group=B name=\"NtvN2011\"/>\nOne of the two sets of locks in the Afsluitdijk was named after him.\n\n===Family life===\nIn 1881, Lorentz married Aletta Catharina Kaiser. Her father was J.W. Kaiser, a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. He was the Director of the museum which later became the well-known [[Rijksmuseum]] (National Gallery). He also was the designer of the first postage stamps of The Netherlands.\n\nThere were two daughters, and one son from this marriage.\n\n[[Geertruida de Haas-Lorentz|Dr. Geertruida Luberta Lorentz]], the eldest daughter, was a physicist.
