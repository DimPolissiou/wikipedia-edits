While the area was part of [[Virginia]] (prior to 1861), the town was incorporated as '''Bath'''. Since 1802, it has been referred to by the name of its original Virginia [[post office]], Berkeley Springs. The population of the town was 800 (estimated). The town is located within the [[Hagerstown Metropolitan Area|Hagerstown\u2013Martinsburg, MD\u2013WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Berkeley Springs is a sister city to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]], England.\n\nThe area contains mineral water springs that were frequented by Native Americans indigenous to the area, possibly for thousands of years. After settlement by Europeans, the [[mineral springs]] drew many visitors from urban areas. Notable colonial visitors to the area included [[George Washington]] and [[James Rumsey]]. Berkeley Springs remained a popular resort area during the early years of the United States. It is the home of the Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting,<ref>[http://www.berkeleysprings.com/water/about.htm Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the longest running and largest such event in the world. And a more \"Local\" Tradition is the famed Apple Butter Festival,  started by then Mayor Frank Heiner in 1974, celebrating its 45th year in 2019.\n\nThe area continues to be a popular resort area with tourism the main industry in the county and four full-service spas using the mineral water. A historic building whose construction began in 1888, was built as a [[Samuel Taylor Suit Cottage|retreat]] for [[Samuel Taylor Suit|Rosa and Samuel Taylor Suit]] overlooking the town. It often is called \"Berkeley Castle\".\n\nBerkeley Springs is a noted arts community with working artists accounting for approximately 1% of the county population of 16,000. Since 1994, the town has been listed in all four editions of John Villani's \"100 Best Art Towns in America\" (one of only 11 towns so rated).\n\n==History==\n[[File:BerkeleyCastle WestVirginia.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Samuel Taylor Suit Cottage]] overlooks the town and often is referred to as the \"Berkeley Castle\"; note the fall colors characteristic of the [[Appalachian mountains]]]]\n[[File:1586-1587 - Berkeley Springs State Park.jpg|thumb|right|View of part of [[Berkeley Springs State Park]]]]\nDuring colonial times in 1748, [[George Washington]], then just 16 years old, was part of the team that surveyed the [[Eastern Panhandle]] region for [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]]. Washington returned several times over the next several years with his half-brother, Lawrence, who was ill, in hopes that the warm springs might improve his health. The springs, and their rumored medicinal benefits, attracted numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as well as Europeans to the area.\n\nWhile vacationing in the area in 1767, Washington made note of how busy the colonial town had become. Lord Fairfax had built a summer home there and a \"private bath\" making the area a popular destination for [[Virginia]]'s social elite. With the advent of independence, ''An act for establishing a town at the Warm Springs in the county of Berkeley''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vagenweb.org/hening/vol09-11.htm|title=Hening's Statutes at Large|website=vagenweb.org|access-date=2017-03-05}}</ref> was adopted by the Virginia General Assembly in December 1776. Officially, the town was  named '''Bath''', in honor of England's spa city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. George Washington, his family members and several of the colonial elite were among the town's first landowners. The town's main north-south street was named Washington and the main east-west street was named Fairfax. Also, four acres were set aside for \"suffering humanity.\" The area around the springs always was public land known as ''The Grove'' and overseen by a state-appointed group of Berkeley Springs trustees. This would become a [[Berkeley Springs State Park|historic park]] with its springs and bathhouses, which was made part of the West Virginia state park system in 1925. Nearby, [[Cacapon State Park]] was opened in 1933. The mountain that gives its name to the park has an elevation of {{convert|2320|ft|m}} above sea level.\n\n[[File:North Berkeley - aqueduct.jpg|thumb|left|Storage bins (no longer in use). At one time, they were used by the local sand mine for loading train cars for distribution.]]\nBath's population increased during and immediately after, the Revolutionary War as wounded soldiers and others came to the area believing that the warm springs had medicinal qualities. Bath gained a reputation then as a somewhat wild town where eating, drinking, dancing, and gambling on the daily horse races were the order of the day.\n\n===Chronology of names===\nIn 1772, the springs were part of the newly formed Berkeley County, named after its colonial governor, Norborne Berkeley. The waters became known as Berkeley Springs because the existing protocol was to name springs after the colonial Virginia county in which they were located. Previously, the area had been called ''Warm Springs'' and ''Medicinal Springs'' among other names.\n\nBath became known permanently to the world as ''Berkeley Springs'' in 1802 when the Virginia postal system was established in the new nation and there already was a Bath, Virginia, in [[Bath County, Virginia|Bath County]].\n\nIn 1861, many residents of Virginia were opposed to Virginia's secession from the United States, some calling the act of secession treasonous. Following the [[Wheeling Convention|Wheeling Conventions of 1861]], a referendum was held in 41 mostly northwestern Virginia counties on whether to secede from Virginia and seek admission to the United States as a new state. An overwhelming majority of voters in these counties voted in favor of the proposal. The State of West Virginia was admitted to the United States on June 20, 1863. Berkeley Springs remained the conventional name used for the town. Its [[sister city]] is Bath, England.\n[[File:1615 - Berkeley Springs - Train Station.JPG|thumb|right|The former train station]]\n\n==Geography==\nBerkeley Springs is located at {{coord|39|37|32|N|78|13|37|W|type:city}} (39.625562, \u221278.226862),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> in the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The town lies in the [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia]] 26 miles NW of [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]] and 36 miles W of [[Hagerstown, Maryland]].

West Virginia Route 9 runs east and west through the town.\n\nThere are two rivers in Morgan County. The [[Potomac River|Potomac]] makes up the northern border and the [[Cacapon River]] cuts through the center of the county connecting with the Potomac at [[Great Cacapon, West Virginia|Great Cacapon]]. The [[Cacapon Mountain|Cacapon]] and [[Sleepy Creek Mountain]]s are the two most notable mountains in the county. Berkeley Springs is nestled in the extreme northern [[Shenandoah Valley]] at an elevation of approximately 499 feet. [[Warm Spring Run]] cuts through the center of the town and eventually, connects with the Potomac River near the Hancock Station. [[Sleepy Creek]] connects with the Potomac along River Road north and east of the town.\n[[File:George Washington's Bathtub.jpg|thumb|left|\"Bathtub\" used by George Washington]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 77\n|1860= 2982\n|1870= 407\n|1880= 534\n|1900= 781\n|1910= 864\n|1920= 980\n|1930= 1039\n|1940= 1145\n|1950= 1213\n|1960= 1138\n|1970= 944\n|1980= 789\n|1990= 735\n|2000= 663\n|2010= 624\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=601\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|author=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=August 30, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412035529/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 12, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:BerkeleySpringsSP WestVirginia.jpg|thumb|Another view of part of Berkeley Springs State Park, with fall colors]]\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref> of 2010, there were 624 people, 314 households, and 158 families residing in the incorporated town of Bath.

While the area was part of [[Virginia]] (prior to 1861), the town was incorporated as '''Bath'''. Since 1802, it has been referred to by the name of its original Virginia [[post office]], Berkeley Springs. The population of the town was 800 (estimated). The town is located within the [[Hagerstown Metropolitan Area|Hagerstown\u2013Martinsburg, MD\u2013WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Berkeley Springs is a sister city to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]], England.\n\nThe area contains mineral water springs that were frequented by Native Americans indigenous to the area, possibly for thousands of years. After settlement by Europeans, the [[mineral springs]] drew many visitors from urban areas. Notable colonial visitors to the area included [[George Washington]] and [[James Rumsey]]. Berkeley Springs remained a popular resort area during the early years of the United States. It is the home of the Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting,<ref>[http://www.berkeleysprings.com/water/about.htm Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the longest running and largest such event in the world. And a more \"Local\" Tradition is the famed Apple Butter Festival,  started by then Mayor Frank Heiner in 1974, celebrating its 45th year in 2019.\n\nThe area continues to be a popular resort area with tourism the main industry in the county and four full-service spas using the mineral water. A historic building whose construction began in 1888, was built as a [[Samuel Taylor Suit Cottage|retreat]] for [[Samuel Taylor Suit|Rosa and Samuel Taylor Suit]] overlooking the town. It often is called \"Berkeley Castle\".\n\nBerkeley Springs is a noted arts community with working artists accounting for approximately 1% of the county population of 16,000. Since 1994, the town has been listed in all four editions of John Villani's \"100 Best Art Towns in America\" (one of only 11 towns so rated).\n\n==History==\n[[File:BerkeleyCastle WestVirginia.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Samuel Taylor Suit Cottage]] overlooks the town and often is referred to as the \"Berkeley Castle\"; note the fall colors characteristic of the [[Appalachian mountains]]]]\n[[File:1586-1587 - Berkeley Springs State Park.jpg|thumb|right|View of part of [[Berkeley Springs State Park]]]]\nDuring colonial times in 1748, [[George Washington]], then just 16 years old, was part of the team that surveyed the [[Eastern Panhandle]] region for [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]]. Washington returned several times over the next several years with his half-brother, Lawrence, who was ill, in hopes that the warm springs might improve his health. The springs, and their rumored medicinal benefits, attracted numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as well as Europeans to the area.\n\nWhile vacationing in the area in 1767, Washington made note of how busy the colonial town had become. Lord Fairfax had built a summer home there and a \"private bath\" making the area a popular destination for [[Virginia]]'s social elite. With the advent of independence, ''An act for establishing a town at the Warm Springs in the county of Berkeley''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vagenweb.org/hening/vol09-11.htm|title=Hening's Statutes at Large|website=vagenweb.org|access-date=2017-03-05}}</ref> was adopted by the Virginia General Assembly in December 1776. Officially, the town was  named '''Bath''', in honor of England's spa city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. George Washington, his family members and several of the colonial elite were among the town's first landowners. The town's main north-south street was named Washington and the main east-west street was named Fairfax. Also, four acres were set aside for \"suffering humanity.\" The area around the springs always was public land known as ''The Grove'' and overseen by a state-appointed group of Berkeley Springs trustees. This would become a [[Berkeley Springs State Park|historic park]] with its springs and bathhouses, which was made part of the West Virginia state park system in 1925. Nearby, [[Cacapon State Park]] was opened in 1933. The mountain that gives its name to the park has an elevation of {{convert|2320|ft|m}} above sea level.\n\n[[File:North Berkeley - aqueduct.jpg|thumb|left|Storage bins (no longer in use). At one time, they were used by the local sand mine for loading train cars for distribution.]]\nBath's population increased during and immediately after, the Revolutionary War as wounded soldiers and others came to the area believing that the warm springs had medicinal qualities. Bath gained a reputation then as a somewhat wild town where eating, drinking, dancing, and gambling on the daily horse races were the order of the day.\n\n===Chronology of names===\nIn 1772, the springs were part of the newly formed Berkeley County, named after its colonial governor, Norborne Berkeley. The waters became known as Berkeley Springs because the existing protocol was to name springs after the colonial Virginia county in which they were located. Previously, the area had been called ''Warm Springs'' and ''Medicinal Springs'' among other names.\n\nBath became known permanently to the world as ''Berkeley Springs'' in 1802 when the Virginia postal system was established in the new nation and there already was a Bath, Virginia, in [[Bath County, Virginia|Bath County]].\n\nIn 1861, many residents of Virginia were opposed to Virginia's secession from the United States, some calling the act of secession treasonous. Following the [[Wheeling Convention|Wheeling Conventions of 1861]], a referendum was held in 41 mostly northwestern Virginia counties on whether to secede from Virginia and seek admission to the United States as a new state. An overwhelming majority of voters in these counties voted in favor of the proposal. The State of West Virginia was admitted to the United States on June 20, 1863. Berkeley Springs remained the conventional name used for the town. Its [[sister city]] is Bath, England.\n[[File:1615 - Berkeley Springs - Train Station.JPG|thumb|right|The former train station]]\n\n==Geography==\nBerkeley Springs is located at {{coord|39|37|32|N|78|13|37|W|type:city}} (39.625562, \u221278.226862),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> in the [[Appalachian Mountains]].

West Virginia Route 9 runs east and west through the town.\n\nThere are two rivers in Morgan County. The [[Potomac River|Potomac]] makes up the northern border and the [[Cacapon River]] cuts through the center of the county connecting with the Potomac at [[Great Cacapon, West Virginia|Great Cacapon]]. The [[Cacapon Mountain|Cacapon]] and [[Sleepy Creek Mountain]]s are the two most notable mountains in the county. Berkeley Springs is nestled in the extreme northern [[Shenandoah Valley]] at an elevation of approximately 499 feet. [[Warm Spring Run]] cuts through the center of the town and eventually, connects with the Potomac River near the Hancock Station.

It was the first Category&nbsp;5 hurricane on record to impact the [[Florida Panhandle]], the fourth-strongest landfalling hurricane in the contiguous United States, in terms of wind speed, and was the most intense hurricane on [[Atlantic hurricane records|record]] to strike the United States in the month of October.\n\nThe thirteenth [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]], seventh [[hurricane]], and second [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale|major hurricane]] of the [[2018 Atlantic hurricane season]], Michael originated from a broad [[low-pressure area]] that formed in the southwestern [[Caribbean Sea]] on October 1. The disturbance became a tropical depression on October 7, after nearly a week of slow development. By the next day, Michael had intensified into a hurricane near the [[Guanahacabibes Peninsula|western tip]] of [[Cuba]], as it moved northward.

four trends: weak [[Political parties in the United States|national parties]] and strong political representation of individual districts, the large U.S. military establishment after [[World War II]],

which he characterises as a system in which the state is far too involved in the economy, tasked with \"protecting everyone against everyone else\", but in which at the same time big companies have a great deal of influence on the government, with lobbyists' suggestions being \"welcome, especially if they come with bribes\".<ref name=\"Phelps2013\">[[Edmund Phelps|Phelps, Edmund]] (2013).

For example, Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] explained in December 2014 how an omnibus spending bill required to fund the government was modified late in the process to weaken banking regulations. The modification made it easier to allow taxpayer-funded bailouts of banking \"swaps entities\", which the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank]] banking regulations prohibited. She singled out [[Citigroup]], one of the largest banks, which had a role in modifying the legislation. She also explained how both Wall Street bankers and members of the government that formerly had worked on Wall Street stopped bi-partisan legislation that would have broken up the largest banks. She repeated President Theodore Roosevelt's warnings regarding powerful corporate entities that threatened the \"very foundations of Democracy.\"<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJpTxONxvoo|title=Remarks by Senator Warren on Citigroup and its bailout provision|date=12 December 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Perceived symptoms of corporatocracy in the United States==\n===Share of income===\n[[File:U.S. Compensation as Percent of GDP - v1.png|right|thumb|400px|Labor's share of GDP has declined 1970 to 2013, measured based on total compensation as well as salaries and wages.

Nobel Prize winner of economics [[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote in May 2011: \"Much of today\u2019s inequality is due to manipulation of the financial system, enabled by changes in the rules that have been bought and paid for by the financial industry itself\u2014one of its best investments ever. The government lent money to financial institutions at close to zero percent interest and provided generous bailouts on favorable terms when all else failed. Regulators turned a blind eye to a lack of transparency and to conflicts of interest.\" Stiglitz explained that the top 1% got nearly \"one-quarter\" of the income and own approximately 40% of the wealth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105|title=Of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%|author=Joseph E. Stiglitz|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nMeasured relative to GDP, total compensation and its component wages and salaries have been declining since 1970. This indicates a shift in income from labor (persons who derive income from hourly wages and salaries) to capital (persons who derive income via ownership of businesses, land and assets).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/monetary-policy-and-long-term-trends|title=Monetary policy and long-term trends|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=2014-11-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Larry Summers]] estimated in 2007 that the lower 80% of families were receiving $664 billion less income than they would be with a 1979 income distribution, or approximately $7,000 per family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://larrysummers.com/commentary/financial-times-columns/harness-market-forces-to-share-prosperity-june-24-2007/|title=Harness market forces to share prosperity |author=Larry Summers|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> Not receiving this income may have led many families to increase their debt burden, a significant factor in the 2007\u20132009 [[subprime mortgage crisis]], as highly leveraged homeowners suffered a much larger reduction in their net worth during the crisis.

About 46 companies have reincorporated in low-tax countries since 1982, including 15 since 2012. Six more also planned to do so in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/tax-inversion|title=Tax inversion|last=Mider|first=Zachary|date=2017|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Stock buybacks versus wage increases===\nOne indication of increasing corporate power was the removal of restrictions on their ability to buy back stock, contributing to increased income inequality. Writing in the ''Harvard Business Review'' in September 2014, William Lazonick blamed record corporate [[share repurchase|stock buybacks]] for reduced investment in the economy and a corresponding impact on prosperity and income inequality. Between 2003 and 2012, the 449 companies in the S&P 500 used 54% of their earnings ($2.4 trillion) to buy back their own stock. An additional 37% was paid to stockholders as dividends. Together, these were 91% of profits. This left little for investment in productive capabilities or higher income for employees, shifting more income to capital rather than labor. He blamed executive compensation arrangements, which are heavily based on stock options, stock awards and bonuses for meeting earnings per share (EPS) targets. EPS increases as the number of outstanding shares decreases. Legal restrictions on buybacks were greatly eased in the early 1980s. He advocates changing these incentives to limit buybacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity/ar/1|title=Profits Without Prosperity|work=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-in-corporations-its-owner-take-all/2014/08/26/0c1a002a-2ca7-11e4-bb9b-997ae96fad33_story.html|title=In corporations, it's owner-take-all|author=Harold Meyerson|date=26 August 2014|work=Washington Post|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 12 months to March 31, 2014, S&P 500 companies increased their stock buyback payouts by 29% year on year, to $534.9 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef626fc4-f6f7-11e3-b271-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3IVLb48yU|title=US share buybacks and dividends hit record|work=Financial Times|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> U.S. companies are projected to increase buybacks to $701 billion in 2015 according to Goldman Sachs, an 18% increase over 2014.

It\u2019s also their concentration, their capacity to influence, and often infiltrate, governments and their ability to act as a genuine international social class in order to defend their commercial interests against the common good. It is such decision making power as well as the power to impose deregulation over the past 30 years, resulting in changes to national constitutions, and to national and international legislation which has created the environment for corporate crime and impunity.\" Brennan concludes that this concentration in power leads to again more concentration of income and wealth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/article/state-corporate-power|title=The State of Corporate Power|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=2014-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/briefing/state-power-2014|title=State of Power 2014|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=2014-01-21}}</ref>\n\nAn example of such industry concentration is in banking.

suggested that it arose from four trends: weak [[Political parties in the United States|national parties]] and strong political representation of individual districts, the large U.S. military

calls \"the new [[corporatism]]\", which he characterises as a system in which the state is far too involved in the economy, tasked with \"protecting everyone against everyone else\", but in which at the same time big companies have a great deal of influence on the government, with lobbyists' suggestions being \"welcome, especially if they come with bribes\".<ref name=\"Phelps2013\">[[Edmund

The modification made it easier to allow taxpayer-funded bailouts of banking \"swaps entities\", which the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank]] banking regulations prohibited. She singled out [[Citigroup]], one of the largest banks, which had a role in modifying the legislation. She also explained how both Wall Street bankers and members of the government that formerly had worked on Wall Street stopped bi-partisan legislation that would have broken up the largest banks. She repeated President Theodore Roosevelt's warnings regarding powerful corporate entities that threatened the \"very foundations of Democracy.\"<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJpTxONxvoo|title=Remarks by Senator Warren on Citigroup and its bailout provision|date=12 December 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Perceived symptoms of corporatocracy in the United States==\n\n===Share of income===\n[[File:U.S. Compensation as Percent of GDP - v1.png|right|thumb|400px|Labor's share of GDP has declined 1970 to 2013, measured based on total compensation as well as salaries and wages.

Nobel Prize winner of economics [[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote in May 2011: \"Much of today\u2019s inequality is due to manipulation of the financial system, enabled by changes in the rules that have been bought and paid for by the financial industry itself\u2014one of its best investments ever. The government lent money to financial institutions at close to zero percent interest and provided generous bailouts on favorable terms when all else failed. Regulators turned a blind eye to a lack of transparency and to conflicts of interest.\" Stiglitz explained that the top 1% got nearly \"one-quarter\" of the income and own approximately 40% of the wealth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105|title=Of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%|author=Joseph E. Stiglitz|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nMeasured relative to GDP, total compensation and its component wages and salaries have been declining since 1970. This indicates a shift in income from labor (persons who derive income from hourly wages and salaries) to capital (persons who derive income via ownership of businesses, land and assets).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/monetary-policy-and-long-term-trends|title=Monetary policy and long-term trends|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=2014-11-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Larry Summers]] estimated in 2007 that the lower 80% of families were receiving $664 billion less income than they would be with a 1979 income distribution, or approximately $7,000 per family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://larrysummers.com/commentary/financial-times-columns/harness-market-forces-to-share-prosperity-june-24-2007/|title=Harness market forces to share prosperity |author=Larry Summers|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> Not receiving this income may have led many families to increase their debt burden, a significant factor in the 2007\u20132009 [[subprime mortgage crisis]], as highly leveraged homeowners suffered a much larger reduction in their net worth during the crisis.

About 46 companies have reincorporated in low-tax countries since 1982, including 15 since 2012. Six more also planned to do so in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/tax-inversion|title=Tax inversion|last=Mider|first=Zachary|date=2017|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Stock buybacks versus wage increases===\nOne indication of increasing corporate power was the removal of restrictions on their ability to buy back stock, contributing to increased income inequality. Writing in the ''Harvard Business Review'' in September 2014, William Lazonick blamed record corporate [[share repurchase|stock buybacks]] for reduced investment in the economy and a corresponding impact on prosperity and income inequality.  Between 2003 and 2012, the 449 companies in the S&P 500 used 54% of their earnings ($2.4 trillion) to buy back their own stock. An additional 37% was paid to stockholders as dividends. Together, these were 91% of profits. This left little for investment in productive capabilities or higher income for employees, shifting more income to capital rather than labor. He blamed executive compensation arrangements, which are heavily based on stock options, stock awards and bonuses for meeting earnings per share (EPS) targets. EPS increases as the number of outstanding shares decreases. Legal restrictions on buybacks were greatly eased in the early 1980s. He advocates changing these incentives to limit buybacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity/ar/1|title=Profits Without Prosperity|work=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-in-corporations-its-owner-take-all/2014/08/26/0c1a002a-2ca7-11e4-bb9b-997ae96fad33_story.html|title=In corporations, it's owner-take-all|author=Harold Meyerson|date=26 August 2014|work=Washington Post|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 12 months to March 31, 2014, S&P 500 companies increased their stock buyback payouts by 29% year on year, to $534.9 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef626fc4-f6f7-11e3-b271-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3IVLb48yU|title=US share buybacks and dividends hit record|work=Financial Times|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> U.S. companies are projected to increase buybacks to $701 billion in 2015 according to Goldman Sachs, an 18% increase over 2014.

It\u2019s also their concentration, their capacity to influence, and often infiltrate, governments and their ability to act as a genuine international social class in order to defend their commercial interests against the common good. It is such decision making power as well as the power to impose deregulation over the past 30 years, resulting in changes to national constitutions, and to national and international legislation which has created the environment for corporate crime and impunity.\" Brennan concludes that this concentration in power leads to again more concentration of income and wealth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/article/state-corporate-power|title=The State of Corporate Power|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=2014-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/briefing/state-power-2014|title=State of Power 2014|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=2014-01-21}}</ref>\n\nAn example of such industry concentration is in banking.

Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ring leaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced.

The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves.

It is often the home of short term serials by established [[Shogakukan]] artists, as well as a place to break in new, up-and-coming Japanese [[Mangaka|manga artist]]. In April 2004 the magazine switched from being published monthly to bi-monthly. It was bi-monthly from 2004 to 2009, it has since changed back to monthly.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a series to transfer to ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday'' if it becomes popular, such as [[Hiroyuki Nishimori]]'s ''[[Ky\u014d Kara Ore Wa!!]]'' and [[Takuya Mitsuda]]'s ''[[Kenta Yarimasu!]]''. Both of these artists debuted in ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday Super'', only to \"graduate\" to the more popular ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday'', where they are still published currently.\n\nWhen works from this magazine are collected into [[tank\u014dbon]] format, they are published under the same ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday Comics'' label as the titles that appear in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday'', making the titles' source magazine indistinguishable once collected. This was purposefully done in case a title was transferred from ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday Super'' to ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday''.\n\nFrequently artists that have graduated to ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday'' will have posters or calendars of their weekly series featured in ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday Super''. Another common practice is for former ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday Super'' [[Mangaka|manga artists]] to contribute a single supplemental chapter of a hit series to this magazine, even if that series was serialized entirely in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday''.

It is often the home of short term serials by established [[Shogakukan]] artists, as well as a place to break in new, up-and-coming Japanese [[Mangaka|manga artist]]. In April 2004 the magazine switched from being published monthly to bi-monthly. It was bi-monthly from 2004 to 2009, it has since changed back to monthly.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a series to transfer to ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday'' if it becomes popular, such as [[Hiroyuki Nishimori]]'s ''[[Ky\u014d Kara Ore Wa!!]]'' and [[Takuya Mitsuda]]'s ''[[Kenta Yarimasu!]]''. Both of these artists debuted in ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday Super'', only to \"graduate\" to the more popular ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday'', where they are still published currently.\n\nWhen works from this magazine are collected into [[tank\u014dbon]] format, they are published under the same ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday Comics'' label as the titles that appear in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday'', making the titles' source magazine indistinguishable once collected. This was purposefully done in case a title was transferred from ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday Super'' to ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday''.\n\nFrequently artists that have graduated to ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday'' will have posters or calendars of their weekly series featured in ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday Super''. Another common practice is for former ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday Super'' [[Mangaka|manga artists]] to contribute a single supplemental chapter of a hit series to this magazine, even if that series was serialized entirely in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday''. Examples include ''[[Cheeky Angel]]'' and ''[[D-Live!!]]'' (pictured above), which both had a chapter published in ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday Super'' following their conclusion in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday''.<ref name=\"A Cheeky Angel Gaizan\">{{cite news |url=http://home.pacifier.com/%7Ecaspian/Main%20page/Cheeky_Extra.htm |publisher=Cheeky Angel Page\n|title=Cheeky Angel Page|date=December 7, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Past series ==\n* 1978-1980\n**''Phantom Burai,'' written by [[Buronson]] with art by [[Kaoru Shintani]]\n** ''[[Nine (manga)|Nine]]'' by [[Mitsuru Adachi]]\n* 1981\n**''Chance'' by Kei Satomi\n** ''[[Cosmo Police Justy|Justy]]'' by Tsuguo Okazaki\n* 1982\n**''Kaze no Senshi Dan,'' written by Tetsu Kariya with art by [[Kazuhiko Shimamoto]]\n** ''Saraba Jinrui'' by [[Noboru Rokuda]]\n* 1983\n**''Takeru'' by [[Osamu Ishiwata]]\n** ''Night'' by [[Mitsuo Hashimoto (manga artist)|Mitsuo Hashimoto]]\n** ''[[Prefectural Earth Defense Force]]'' by [[K\u014dichir\u014d Yasunaga]]\n* 1984\n**''Striker Retsuden'' by Takeshi Miya\n* 1985\n**''[[Birdy the Mighty]]'' by [[Yuki Masami]] (moved to ''[[Young Sunday]]'')\n* 1986\n**''Maboroshi Umaboroshi'' by [[Katsu Aki]]\n** ''[[Caravan Kidd]]'' by [[Johji Manabe]]\n** ''Yagami-kun no Katei Jijo'' by [[Kei Kusunoki]]\n* 1987\n**''[[Magic Kaito]]'' by [[Gosho Aoyama]] (published intermittently)\n* 1988\n**''Seventeen Cop,'' written by Toshiyuki Tanabe with art by Yu Nakahara\n** ''[[Ky\u014d Kara Ore Wa!!]]'' by [[Hiroyuki Nishimori]] (moved to ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'')\n** ''Kenta Yarimasu!'' by [[Takuya Mitsuda]] (moved to [[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday|''Weekly'' ''Sh\u014dnen Sunday'']])\n* 1989\n**''Seishun Tiebreak!'' by Harumi Matsuzaki\n** ''Kojiro'' by [[Kenichi Muraeda]]\n* 1990\n**''RATS'' by [[Masahiko Nakahira]]\n** ''Yugengaisha Shinahyakkaten'' by [[Takashi Shiina]]\n** ''Junk Party'' by [[Johji Manabe]]\n* 1991\n**''Sengoku K\u014dshien'' by [[K\u014dji Kiriyama]] (moved to ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'')\n** ''Rappa S.S.'' by [[Takashi Shiina]]\n* 1992\n**''Kaitei Jinrui Anchovy'' by [[K\u014dichir\u014d Yasunaga]]\n** ''[[Ogre Slayer]]'' by [[Kei Kusunoki]]\n** ''[[Spriggan (manga)|Spriggan]],'' written by [[Hiroshi Takashige]] with art by [[Ryoji Minagawa]] (moved from ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'')\n* 1993\n**''Byakuren no Fang'' by [[Yoshihiro Takahashi]]\n* 1994\n**''[[Super Street Fighter II]]'' by [[Masahiko Nakahira]]\n** ''[[Samurai Shodown (video game)|Samurai Spirits]],'' written by Ky\u014dichi Nanatsuki with art by Y\u016bki Miyoshi\n* 1995\n**''Sodatte Darling!!'' by [[K\u014dji Kumeta]]\n* 1996\n**''Tennen Senshi G'' by Naoya Matsumori\n** ''Meibutsu!!

Aware of their vanishing authority, Congress, on September 28, after some debate, resolved unanimously to submit the Constitution to the States for action, \"in conformity to the resolves of the Convention\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/ressub02.asp|title=Resolution of Congress of September 28, 1787, Submitting the Constitution to the Several States|publisher=The [[Avalon Project]] at Yale Law School|accessdate=August 31, 2014}}</ref> but with no recommendation either for or against its adoption.\n\nTwo parties soon developed, one in opposition, the [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]], and one in support, the [[Federalist#United States|Federalists]], of the Constitution; and the Constitution was debated, criticized, and expounded upon clause by clause. [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]], [[James Madison|Madison]], and [[John Jay|Jay]], under the name of [[The Federalist Papers#Origins|Publius]], wrote a series of commentaries, now known as ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', in support of ratification in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], at that time a hotbed of anti-Federalism.  These commentaries on the Constitution, written during the struggle for ratification, have been frequently cited by the Supreme Court as an authoritative contemporary interpretation of the meaning of its provisions.  The dispute over additional powers for the central government was close, and in some states ratification was effected only after a bitter struggle in the state convention itself.\n\nOn June 21, 1788, the constitution had been ratified by the minimum of nine states required under Article VII.  Towards the end of July, and with eleven states then having ratified, the process of organizing the new government began.  The Continental Congress, which still functioned at irregular intervals, passed a resolution on September 13, 1788, to put the new Constitution into operation with the eleven states that had then ratified it.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolu01.asp\n |title= Resolution of the Congress, of September 13, 1788, Fixing Date for Election of a President, and the Organization of the Government Under the Constitution, in the City of New York\n |via= [[Avalon Project]] }}</ref> The federal government began operations under the new form of government on March 4, 1789.

These were associated with the combination of consolidated government along with federal relationships with constituent states.\n\nThe [[Due Process Clause]] of the Constitution was partly based on [[common law]] and on [[Magna Carta]] (1215), which had become a foundation of English liberty against arbitrary power wielded by a ruler.\n\nAmong the most prominent political theorists of the late eighteenth century were [[William Blackstone]], [[John Locke]], and [[Montesquieu]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Manning |first=John F.|date=2011 |title=Separation of Powers as Ordinary Interpretation |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=1939\u20132039 }}</ref>\n\nBoth the influence of [[Edward Coke]] and William Blackstone were evident at the Convention. In his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'', Edward Coke interpreted Magna Carta protections and rights to apply not just to nobles, but to all British subjects. In writing the [[London Company|Virginia Charter of 1606]], he enabled the King in Parliament to give those to be born in the colonies all rights and liberties as though they were born in England. William Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' were the most influential books on law in the new republic.\n\nBritish political philosopher John Locke following the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688) was a major influence expanding on the contract theory of government advanced by [[Thomas Hobbes]]. Locke advanced the principle of [[consent of the governed]] in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Government's duty under a [[social contract]] among the sovereign people was to serve the people by protecting their rights. These basic rights were [[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness#Lockean roots hypothesis|life, liberty and property]].\n\nMontesquieu's influence on the framers is evident in Madison's [[Federalist No. 47]] and Hamilton's [[Federalist No. 78]].

It neither assigns powers to the federal government,<ref>''See [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]]'', 197 U.S. 11, 22 (1905) (\"Although th[e] preamble indicates the general purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution, it has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on the government of the United States, or on any of its departments.\"); ''see also United States v.

It cannot confer any power ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. It can never amount, by implication, to an enlargement of any power expressly given. It can never be the legitimate source of any implied power, when otherwise withdrawn from the constitution. Its true office is to expound the nature and extent and application of the powers actually conferred by the constitution, and not substantively to create them.\" (quoting 1 JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES \u00a7 462 (1833)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</ref> nor does it place specific limitations on government action. Rather, it sets out the origin, scope and purpose of the Constitution. Its origin and authority is in \"We, the people of the United States\". This echoes the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. \"One people\" dissolved their connection with another, and assumed among the powers of the earth, a sovereign nation-state. The scope of the Constitution is twofold. First, \"to form a more perfect Union\" than had previously existed in the \"perpetual Union\" of the Articles of Confederation. Second, to \"secure the blessings of liberty\", which were to be enjoyed by not only the first generation, but for all who came after, \"our posterity\".{{sfn|Adler|Gorman|1975|p=26, 80, 136}}\n\n===Article One===\n[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] describes the [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[legislature|legislative branch]] of the federal government. Section 1, reads, \"All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].\" The article establishes the manner of [[Elections in the United States|election]] and the qualifications of members of each body. Representatives must be at least 25 years old, be a citizen of the United States for seven years, and live in the state they represent. Senators must be at least 30 years old, be a citizen for nine years, and live in the state they represent.\n\n[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8]] enumerates the powers delegated to the legislature. Financially, Congress has the power to tax, borrow, pay debt and provide for the common defense and the general welfare; to regulate commerce, bankruptcies, and coin money. To regulate internal affairs, it has the power to regulate and govern military forces and militias, suppress insurrections and repel invasions. It is to provide for naturalization, standards of weights and measures, post offices and roads, and patents; to directly govern the federal district and cessions of land by the states for forts and arsenals. Internationally, Congress has the power to define and punish piracies and offenses against the Law of Nations, to declare war and make rules of war. The final [[Necessary and Proper Clause]], also known as the Elastic Clause, expressly confers incidental powers upon Congress without the Articles' requirement for express delegation for each and every power. [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, Section 9]] lists eight specific limits on congressional power.\n\nThe Supreme Court has sometimes broadly interpreted the [[Commerce Clause]] and the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] in Article One to allow Congress to enact legislation that is neither expressly allowed by the [[Enumerated powers (United States)|enumerated powers]] nor expressly denied in the limitations on Congress. In ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), the Supreme Court read the Necessary and Proper Clause to permit the federal government to take action that would \"enable [it] to perform the high duties assigned to it [by the Constitution] in the manner most beneficial to the people\",<ref name=\"17US421\">17. U.S. at 421</ref> even if that action is not itself within the enumerated powers. [[John Marshall|Chief Justice Marshall]] clarified: \"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are Constitutional.\"<ref name=\"17US421\" />\n\n===Article Two===\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] describes the office, qualifications, and duties of the [[President of the United States]] and the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. The President is head of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], as well as the nation's [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].\n\nArticle two is modified by the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]] which tacitly acknowledges political parties, and the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] relating to office succession. The president is to receive only one compensation from the federal government. The inaugural oath is specified to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\n\nThe president is the [[Commander-in-chief|Commander in Chief]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and state militias when they are mobilized. He or she makes treaties [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Advice and Consent Clause|with the advice and consent]] of a two-thirds quorum of the Senate. To administer the federal government, the president commissions all the offices of the federal government as Congress directs; he or she may require the opinions of its principal officers and make \"[[recess appointment]]s\" for vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate. The president is to see that the laws are faithfully executed, though he or she may grant reprieves and pardons except regarding Congressional [[impeachment]] of himself or other federal officers. The president reports to Congress on the [[State of the Union]], and by the [[Recommendation Clause]], recommends \"necessary and expedient\" national measures. The president may convene and adjourn Congress under special circumstances.\n\nSection 4 provides for removal of the president and other federal officers. The president is removed on [[impeachment]] for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n===Article Three===\n[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three]] describes the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|court system]] (the [[judiciary|judicial branch]]), including the Supreme Court. There shall be one court called the Supreme Court. The article describes the kinds of cases the court takes as [[original jurisdiction]]. Congress can create lower courts and an appeals process. Congress enacts law defining crimes and providing for punishment. Article Three also protects the right to [[jury trial|trial by jury]] in all [[criminal law|criminal cases]], and defines the crime of [[treason]].\n\nSection 1 vests the judicial power of the United States in federal courts, and with it, the authority to interpret and apply the law to a particular case. Also included is the power to punish, sentence, and direct future action to resolve conflicts. The Constitution outlines the U.S. judicial system. In the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], Congress began to fill in details. Currently, Title 28 of the U.S. Code{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}} describes judicial powers and administration.\n\nAs of the First Congress, the Supreme Court justices rode circuit to sit as panels to hear appeals from the [[United States district court|district courts]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] established six Supreme Court justices. The number was periodically increased, reaching ten in 1863, allowing Lincoln additional appointments. After the Civil War, vacancies reduced the number to seven. Congress finally fixed the number at nine.}} In 1891, Congress enacted a new system. District courts would have [[original jurisdiction]]. Intermediate appellate courts (circuit courts) with [[exclusive jurisdiction]] heard regional appeals before consideration by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court holds [[discretionary jurisdiction]], meaning that it does not have to hear every case that is brought to it.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}\n\nTo enforce judicial decisions, the Constitution grants federal courts both [[Contempt of court|criminal contempt]] and [[Contempt of court|civil contempt]] powers. The court's summary punishment for contempt immediately overrides all other punishments applicable to the subject party. Other implied powers include injunctive relief and the habeas corpus remedy. The Court may imprison for [[contumacy]], bad-faith litigation, and failure to obey a writ of [[mandamus]]. Judicial power includes that granted by Acts of Congress for rules of law and punishment. Judicial power also extends to areas not covered by statute. Generally, federal courts cannot interrupt state court proceedings.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}\n\n[[Case or Controversy Clause|Clause 1 of Section 2]] authorizes the federal courts to hear actual cases and controversies only. Their judicial power does not extend to cases which are hypothetical, or which are proscribed due to [[Standing (law)|standing]], [[mootness]], or [[ripeness]] issues. Generally, a case or controversy requires the presence of adverse parties who have some interest genuinely at stake in the case.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The four concepts which determine \"justiciability\", the formula for a federal court taking and deciding a case, are the doctrines of (a) standing, (b) real and substantial interests, (c) adversity, and (d) avoidance of political questions.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}}\n\nClause 2 of Section 2 provides that the Supreme Court has [[original jurisdiction]] in cases involving ambassadors, ministers and consuls, for all cases respecting foreign nation-states,<ref>[http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/constitution/ FindLaw for legal professionals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116032730/http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/constitution/ |date=January 16, 2013 }}, with links to United States Government Printing office official Web site, Cornell Law School, Emory Law School, and U.S. Supreme Court decisions since 1893, (1998, 2000 Supplement).

Cases arising under the laws of the United States and its treaties come under the jurisdiction of federal courts. Cases under international maritime law and conflicting land grants of different states come under federal courts. Cases between U.S. citizens in different states, and cases between U.S. citizens and foreign states and their citizens, come under federal jurisdiction. The trials will be in the state where the crime was committed.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}\n\nNo part of the Constitution expressly authorizes [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Judicial review|judicial review]], but the Framers did contemplate the idea. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Precedent has since established that the courts could exercise judicial review over the actions of Congress or the executive branch. Two conflicting federal laws are under \"pendent\" jurisdiction if one presents a strict constitutional issue. Federal court jurisdiction is rare when a state legislature enacts something as under federal jurisdiction.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Judicial Review is explained in Hamilton's [[Federalist No. 78]]. It also has roots in Natural Law expressions in the Declaration of Independence. The Supreme Court first ruled an act of Congress unconstitutional in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', the second was [[Dred Scott]].{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}} To establish a federal system of national law, considerable effort goes into developing a spirit of [[comity]] between federal government and states. By the doctrine of '[[Res judicata]]', federal courts give \"full faith and credit\" to State Courts.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For instance, 'collateral estoppel' directs that when a litigant wins in a state court, they cannot sue in federal court to get a more favorable outcome.}} The Supreme Court will decide Constitutional issues of state law only on a case-by-case basis, and only by strict Constitutional necessity, independent of state legislators' motives, their policy outcomes or its national wisdom.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Recently numerous [[habeas corpus]] reforms have tried to preserve a working \"relationship of comity\" and simultaneously streamline the process for state and lower courts to apply Supreme Court interpretations.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}}\n\nSection 3 bars Congress from changing or modifying Federal [[Treason laws in the United States|law on treason]] by simple majority statute.  This section also defines treason, as an [[overt act]] of making war or materially helping those at war with the United States.  Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses.  Congress is a political body and political disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason.  This allows for nonviolent resistance to the government because opposition is not a life or death proposition.  However, Congress does provide for other lesser subversive crimes such as [[List of political conspiracies|conspiracy]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Contrary to this source when viewed, the Constitution provides that punishments, including forfeiture of income and property, must apply to the person convicted. \"No attainder of treason shall work [[Attainder#Corruption of blood|corruption of blood]] or forfeiture\" on the convicted traitor's children or heirs. This avoids the perpetuation of civil war into the generations by Parliamentary majorities as in the [[Wars of the Roses]].{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}}\n\n===Article Four===\n[[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article Four]] outlines the relations among the states and between each state and the federal government. In addition, it provides for such matters as [[admission to the Union|admitting new states]] and border changes between the states.  For instance, it requires states to give \"[[Full Faith and Credit Clause|full faith and credit]]\" to the public acts, records, and court proceedings of the other states.  Congress is permitted to [[regulation|regulate]] the manner in which proof of such acts may be admitted.  The [[Privileges and Immunities Clause|\"privileges and immunities\" clause]] prohibits state governments from discriminating against citizens of other states in favor of resident citizens. For instance, in [[Criminal sentencing in the United States|criminal sentencing]], a state may not increase a penalty on the grounds that the convicted person is a non-resident.\n\nIt also establishes [[extradition]] between the states, as well as laying down a legal basis for [[freedom of movement]] and travel amongst the states. Today, this provision is sometimes taken for granted, but in the days of the [[Articles of Confederation]], crossing state lines was often arduous and costly. The [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Federal property and the Territorial Clause|Territorial Clause]] gives Congress the power to make rules for disposing of federal property and governing non-state territories of the United States.  Finally, the fourth section of Article Four requires the United States to guarantee to each state a [[Republic|republican form of government]], and to protect them from invasion and violence.\n\n===Article Five===\n[[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article Five]] outlines the process for amending the Constitution. Eight state constitutions in effect in 1787 included an amendment mechanism. Amendment making power rested with the legislature in three of the states and in the other five it was given to specially elected conventions. The Articles of Confederation provided that amendments were to be proposed by Congress and ratified by the unanimous vote of all thirteen state legislatures. This proved to be a major flaw in the Articles, as it created an insurmountable obstacle to constitutional reform. The amendment process crafted during the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention was, according to The [[Federalist No. 43]], designed to establish a balance between pliancy and rigidity:<ref>{{cite web |last1= England |first1= Trent |last2= Spalding |first2= Matthew |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Essays on Article V: Amendments |url= http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/129/amendments |publisher= The Heritage Foundation |accessdate= July 31, 2014}}</ref>\n{{quote|It guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the Constitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults. It moreover equally enables the General and the State Governments to originate the amendment of errors, as they may be pointed out by the experience on one side, or on the other.}}\n\nThere are two steps in the amendment process. Proposals to amend the Constitution must be properly adopted and ratified before they change the Constitution. First, there are two procedures for adopting the language of a proposed amendment, either by (a) [[United States Congress|Congress]], by [[Supermajority|two-thirds majority]] in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, or (b) [[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution|national convention]] (which shall take place whenever two-thirds of the state legislatures collectively call for one). Second, there are two procedures for ratifying the proposed amendment, which requires three-fourths of the states' (presently 38 of 50) approval: (a) consent of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]], or (b) consent of [[state ratifying conventions]]. The ratification method is chosen by Congress for each amendment.<ref name=Clayton>{{cite web |url= http://www.clayton.edu/arts-sciences/Constitution-Day/Proposed-Amendments |title= Proposed Amendments |work= Constitution Day Observance Events |publisher= Clayton State University}}</ref> State ratifying conventions were used only once, for the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Toward a Theory of Constitutional Amendment |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=355\u2013370 |last=Lutz |first=Donald |year=1994|doi=10.2307/2944709 |jstor=2944709 }}</ref>\n\nPresently, the [[Archivist of the United States]] is charged with responsibility for administering the ratification process under the provisions of [[Title 1 of the United States Code|1 U.S. Code]] {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|1|106b}}. The Archivist submits the proposed amendment to the states for their consideration by sending a letter of notification to each [[Governor (United States)|Governor]]. Each Governor then formally submits the amendment to their state's legislature. When a state ratifies a proposed amendment, it sends the Archivist an original or certified copy of the state's action. Ratification documents are examined by the [[Office of the Federal Register]] for facial legal sufficiency and an authenticating signature.<ref name=register>{{cite web |title= The Constitutional Amendment Process |url= https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution/ |publisher= National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nArticle Five ends by shielding certain clauses in the new frame of government from being amended. Article One, Section 9, Clauses 1 prevents Congress from passing any law that would restrict the [[History of slavery|importation of slaves]] into the United States prior to 1808, plus the fourth clause from that same section, which reiterates the Constitutional rule that [[direct tax]]es must be apportioned according to state populations. These clauses were explicitly shielded from Constitutional amendment prior to 1808. On January 1, 1808, the first day it was permitted to do so, Congress approved legislation [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibiting the importation of slaves]] into the country. On February 3, 1913, with ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], Congress gained the authority to levy an [[income tax]] without apportioning it among [[U.S. state|the states]] or basing it on the [[United States Census]]. The third textually entrenched provision is Article One, Section 3, Clauses 1, which provides for equal representation of the states in the Senate. The shield protecting this clause from the amendment process is less absolute&nbsp;\u2013 \"no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate\"&nbsp;\u2013 but permanent.\n\n===Article Six===\n[[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article Six]] establishes the Constitution, and all federal laws and treaties of the United States made according to it, to be the [[Supremacy Clause|supreme law]] of the land, and that \"the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the laws or constitutions of any state notwithstanding.\" It validates [[government debt|national debt]] created under the Articles of Confederation and requires that all federal and state legislators, officers, and judges take oaths or affirmations to support the Constitution. This means that the states' constitutions and laws should not conflict with the laws of the federal constitution and that in case of a conflict, state judges are legally bound to honor the federal laws and constitution over those of any state. Article Six also states \"[[No Religious Test Clause|no religious Test]] shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\"\n\n===Article Seven===\n[[Article Seven of the United States Constitution|Article Seven]] describes the process for establishing the proposed new frame of government. Anticipating that the influence of many state politicians would be Antifederalist, delegates to the Philadelphia Convention provided for [[ratification]] of the Constitution by popularly elected [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|ratifying conventions]] in each state. The convention method also made it possible that judges, ministers and others ineligible to serve in state legislatures, could be elected to a convention. Suspecting that Rhode Island, at least, might not ratify, delegates decided that the Constitution would go into effect as soon as nine states (two-thirds rounded up) ratified.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Samuel Eliot Morison |first= Samuel Eliot |last= Morison |title= The Oxford History of the American People |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryof00mori |url-access=registration |year= 1965 |location= Oxford |publisher= Oxford University Press |page= [https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryof00mori/page/312 312]}}</ref> Once ratified by this minimum number of states, it was anticipated that the proposed Constitution would become ''this Constitution'' between the nine or more that signed.

In addition to signatures, this closing endorsement, the Constitution's [[eschatocol]], included a brief declaration that the delegates' work has been successfully completed and that those whose signatures appear on it subscribe to the final document. Included are a statement pronouncing the document's adoption by the states present, a formulaic dating of its adoption, and the signatures of those endorsing it. Additionally, the convention's secretary, [[William Jackson (secretary)|William Jackson]], added a note to verify four amendments made by hand to the final document, and signed the note to authenticate its validity.<ref>Madison, James (1902) ''The Writings of [[James Madison]]'', [https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/madison-the-writings-vol-4-1787 vol. 4, ''1787: The Journal of the Constitutional Convention, Part II''] (edited by G. Hunt), pp. 501\u2013502</ref>\n\nThe language of the concluding endorsement, conceived by [[Gouverneur Morris]] and presented to the convention by [[Benjamin Franklin]], was made intentionally ambiguous in hopes of winning over the votes of dissenting delegates. Advocates for the new frame of government, realizing the impending difficulty of obtaining the consent of the states needed to make it operational, were anxious to obtain the unanimous support of the delegations from each state. It was feared that many of the delegates would refuse to give their individual assent to the Constitution. Therefore, in order that the action of the Convention would appear to be unanimous, the formula, ''Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present ...'' was devised.<ref name=attest>{{cite web|last1=Spaulding|first1=Matthew|title=Attestation Clause|url= http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/7/essays/137/attestation-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe document is dated: \"the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord\" 1787, and \"of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth.\"  This two-fold [[epoch]] dating serves to place the Constitution in the context of the religious traditions of [[Western culture|Western civilization]] and, at the same time, links it to the [[regime]] principles proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence.  This dual reference can also be found in the Articles of Confederation and the [[Northwest Ordinance]].<ref name=attest/>\n\nThe closing endorsement serves an [[authentication]] function only. It neither assigns powers to the federal government nor does it provide specific limitations on government action. It does however, provide essential [[Evidence (law)|documentation]] of the Constitution's validity, a statement of \"This is what was agreed to.\" It records who signed the Constitution, and when and where.\n\n==Amending the Constitution==\nThe procedure for amending the Constitution is outlined in Article Five (see [[#Article Five|above]]). The process is overseen by the [[archivist of the United States]]. Between 1949 and 1985 it was overseen by the [[General Services Administration|administrator of General Services]], and before that by the [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]].<ref name=register/>\n\nUnder Article Five, a proposal for an amendment must be adopted either by Congress or by a national convention, but {{as of|2020|lc=yes}} all amendments have gone through Congress.<ref name=register/> The proposal must receive two thirds of the votes of both houses to proceed. It is passed as a [[joint resolution]], but is not presented to the president, who plays no part in the process. Instead, it is passed to the Office of the Federal Register, which copies it in [[slip law]] format and submits it to the states.<ref name=register/> Congress decides whether the proposal is to be ratified in the state legislature or  by a state ratifying convention. To date all amendments have been ratified by the state legislatures except one, the Twenty-first Amendment.<ref name=Clayton/>\n\nA proposed amendment becomes an operative part of the Constitution as soon as it is ratified by three-fourths of the States (currently 38 of the 50 states). There is no further step. The text requires no additional action by Congress or anyone else after ratification by the required number of states.<ref>{{cite web |last= Neale |first= Thomas H. |title= The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues |url= http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/misc/CRS_2013_summary.pdf |publisher= Congressional Research Service |accessdate= July 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140831102306/http://equalrightsamendment.org/misc/CRS_2013_summary.pdf |archivedate= August 31, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Thus, when the Office of the Federal Register verifies that it has received the required number of authenticated ratification documents, it drafts a formal proclamation for the Archivist to certify that the amendment is valid and has become part of the nation's frame of government.

Structurally, the Constitution's original text and all prior amendments remain untouched. The precedent for this [[Constitutional amendment#Form of changes to the text|practice]] was set in 1789, when [[1st United States Congress|Congress]] considered and proposed the first several Constitutional amendments. Among these, Amendments 1\u201310 are collectively known as the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], and Amendments 13\u201315 are known as the [[Reconstruction Amendments]]. Excluding the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]], which was pending before the states for {{Age in years and days|1789|09|25|1992|05|07}}, the longest pending amendment that was successfully ratified was the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], which took {{Age in years and days|1947|03|21|1951|02|27}}. The [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] was ratified in the shortest time, {{Age in days|1971|03|23|1971|07|01}} days. The [[Arithmetic mean|average]] ratification time for the first twenty-six amendments was 1 year, 252 days; for all twenty-seven, 9 years, 48 days.\n\n===Safeguards of liberty (Amendments 1, 2, and 3)===\nThe [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (1791) prohibits Congress from obstructing the exercise of certain individual freedoms: [[Freedom of religion in the United States|freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of assembly]], and [[right to petition]]. Its [[Free Exercise Clause]] guarantees a person's right to hold whatever religious beliefs he or she wants, and to freely exercise that belief, and its [[Establishment Clause]] prevents the federal government from creating an official national church or favoring one set of religious beliefs over another. The amendment guarantees an individual's right to express and to be exposed to a wide range of opinions and views. It was intended to ensure a free exchange of ideas, even unpopular ones.  It also guarantees an individual's right to physically gather or associate with others in groups for economic, political or religious purposes.

A search can mean everything from a frisking by a police officer or to a demand for a blood test to a search of an individual's home or car. A seizure occurs when the government takes control of an individual or something in his or her possession. Items that are seized often are used as evidence when the individual is charged with a crime. It also imposes certain limitations on police investigating a crime and prevents the use of illegally obtained evidence at trial.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment IV |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-4-search-and-seizure |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] (1791) establishes the requirement that a [[trial]] for a major [[crime]] may commence only after an [[indictment]] has been handed down by a [[grand jury]]; protects individuals from [[double jeopardy]], being tried and put in danger of being punished more than once for the same criminal act; prohibits punishment without [[due process]] of law, thus protecting individuals from being imprisoned without fair procedures; and provides that an accused person may not be compelled to reveal to the police, prosecutor, judge, or jury any information that might [[self-incrimination|incriminate or be used against]] him or her in a court of law. Additionally, the Fifth Amendment also prohibits government from taking private property for public use without \"[[just compensation]]\", the basis of [[eminent domain]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment V |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-5-trial-and-punishment-compensation-for-takings |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] (1791) provides several protections and rights to an individual accused of a crime. The accused has the right to a fair and speedy trial by a local and impartial [[jury]]. Likewise, a person has the right to a public trial. This right protects defendants from secret proceedings that might encourage abuse of the justice system, and serves to keep the public informed. This amendment also guarantees a right to [[Lawyer|legal counsel]] if accused of a crime, guarantees that the accused may require [[witness]]es to attend the trial and testify in the presence of the accused, and guarantees the accused a right to know the charges against them. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled that, with the Fifth Amendment, this amendment requires what has become known as the [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment VI |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-6-right-to-speedy-trial-confrontation-of-witnesses |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] (1791) extends the right to a [[jury trial]] to federal [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] cases, and inhibits courts from overturning a jury's [[Question of law|findings of fact]]. Although the Seventh Amendment itself says that it is limited to \"suits at common law\", meaning cases that triggered the right to a jury under English law, the amendment has been found to apply in lawsuits that are similar to the old common law cases. For example, the right to a jury trial applies to cases brought under federal statutes that prohibit race or gender discrimination in housing or employment. Importantly, this amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial only in federal court, not in state court.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment VII |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-7-trial-by-jury-in-civil-cases |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] (1791) protects people from having [[bail]] or [[fine (penalty)|fines]] set at an amount so high that it would be impossible for all but the richest defendants to pay and also protects people from being subjected to [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. Although this phrase originally was intended to outlaw certain gruesome methods of punishment, it has been broadened over the years to protect against punishments that are grossly disproportionate to or too harsh for the particular crime. This provision has also been used to challenge prison conditions such as extremely unsanitary cells, overcrowding, insufficient medical care and deliberate failure by officials to protect inmates from one another.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment VIII |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-8-cruel-and-unusual-punishment |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Unenumerated rights and reserved powers (Amendments 9 and 10) ===\nThe [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] (1791) declares that individuals have other fundamental rights, in addition to those stated in the Constitution. During the Constitutional ratification debates Anti-Federalists argued that a Bill of Rights should be added.  The Federalists opposed it on grounds that a list would necessarily be incomplete but would be taken as [[enumerative definition|explicit and exhaustive]], thus enlarging the power of the federal government by implication.  The Anti-Federalists persisted, and several state ratification conventions refused to ratify the Constitution without a more specific list of protections, so the First Congress added what became the Ninth Amendment as a compromise. Because the rights protected by the Ninth Amendment are not specified, they are referred to as \"unenumerated\".  The Supreme Court has found that unenumerated rights include such important rights as the right to travel, the right to vote, the right to privacy, and the right to make important decisions about one's health care or body.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment IX |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-9-construction-of-constitution |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] (1791) was included in the Bill of Rights to further define the balance of power between the federal government and the states. The amendment states that the federal government has only those powers specifically granted by the Constitution. These powers include the power to declare war, to collect taxes, to regulate interstate business activities and others that are listed in the articles or in subsequent constitutional amendments. Any power not listed is, says the Tenth Amendment, left to the states or the people. While there is no specific list of what these \"reserved powers\" may be, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws affecting family relations, commerce within a state's own borders, and local law enforcement activities, are among those specifically reserved to the states or the people.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment X |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-10-powers-of-the-states-and-people |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Governmental authority (Amendments 11, 16, 18, and 21)===\nThe [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] (1795) specifically prohibits federal courts from hearing cases in which a state is sued by an individual from another state or another country, thus extending to the states [[Sovereign immunity in the United States|sovereign immunity]] protection from certain types of legal liability. [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Cases and controversies|Article Three, Section 2, Clause 1]] has been affected by this amendment, which also overturned the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Chisholm v.

Specifically, the apportionment constraints delineated in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Apportionment of direct taxes|Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4]] have been removed by this amendment, which also overturned an 1895 Supreme Court decision, in  ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]'', that declared an unapportioned federal income tax on rents, dividends, and interest unconstitutional. This amendment has become the basis for all subsequent federal income tax legislation and has greatly expanded the scope of federal taxing and spending in the years since.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XVI|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-16-status-of-income-tax-clarified|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] (1919) prohibited the making, transporting, and selling of alcoholic beverages nationwide. It also authorized Congress to enact legislation enforcing this prohibition. Adopted at the urging of a national [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance movement]], proponents believed that the use of alcohol was reckless and destructive and that [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] would reduce crime and corruption, solve social problems, decrease the need for welfare and prisons, and improve the health of all Americans. During prohibition, it is estimated that alcohol consumption and alcohol related deaths declined dramatically. But prohibition had other, more negative consequences. The amendment drove the lucrative alcohol business underground, giving rise to a large and pervasive [[Rum-running|black market]]. In addition, prohibition encouraged disrespect for the law and strengthened [[organized crime]]. Prohibition came to an end in 1933, when this amendment was repealed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XVIII|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-18-liquor-abolished|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]] (1933) repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and returned the regulation of alcohol to the states. Each state sets its own rules for the sale and importation of alcohol, including the drinking age.

Rules about how alcohol is sold vary greatly from state to state.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XXI|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-21-amendment-18-repealed|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}</ref>\n\n=== Safeguards of civil rights (Amendments 13, 14, 15, 19, 23, 24, and 26) ===\nThe [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] (1865) abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[involuntary servitude]], except [[Penal labor in the United States|as punishment for a crime]], and authorized Congress to enforce [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]]. Though millions of slaves had been declared free by the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]], their post [[American Civil War|Civil War]] status was unclear, as was the status of other millions.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Emancipation Proclamation |url= https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/ |publisher= National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref> Congress intended the Thirteenth Amendment to be a proclamation of freedom for all slaves throughout the nation and to take the question of emancipation away from politics.

It also contained three new limits on state power: a state shall not violate a citizen's privileges or immunities; shall not deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; and must guarantee all persons equal protection of the laws. These limitations dramatically expanded the protections of the Constitution. This amendment, according to the Supreme Court's Doctrine of [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|Incorporation]], makes most provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to state and local governments as well.  It superseded the mode of apportionment of representatives delineated in Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3, and also overturned the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Dred Scott v.

These decisions are referred to as [[precedent]]s. Judicial review is the power of the Court to examine federal legislation, federal executive, and all state branches of government, to decide their [[constitutionality]], and to strike them down if found unconstitutional.\n\nJudicial review includes the power of the Court to explain the meaning of the Constitution as it applies to particular cases. Over the years, Court decisions on issues ranging from governmental regulation of [[radio]] and [[television]] to the rights of the accused in criminal cases have changed the way many constitutional clauses are interpreted, without amendment to the actual text of the Constitution.\n\nLegislation passed to implement the Constitution, or to adapt those implementations to changing conditions, broadens and, in subtle ways, changes the meanings given to the words of the Constitution. Up to a point, the rules and regulations of the many federal executive agencies have a similar effect. If an action of Congress or the agencies is challenged, however, it is the court system that ultimately decides whether these actions are permissible under the Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court has indicated that once the Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the Courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say \"what the law is\".{{refn|group= lower-alpha |[[Downes v.

First, they have jurisdiction over actions by an officer of government and state law. Second, federal courts may rule on whether coordinate branches of national government conform to the Constitution. Until the twentieth century, the Supreme Court of the United States may have been the only high tribunal in the world to use a court for constitutional interpretation of fundamental law, others generally depending on their national legislature.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=134}}\n\n{|align=right\n|-\n|<center>Early Court roots in the founding</center>\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:John Jay (Gilbert Stuart portrait).jpg|[[John Jay]], <small>1789\u20131795<br />New York co-author<br />''[[The Federalist Papers]]''</small>\nFile:John Marshall by Henry Inman, 1832.jpg|[[John Marshall]], <small>1801\u20131835<br />[[Fauquier County, Virginia|Fauquier County]] delegate<br />Virginia Ratification Convention</small>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe basic theory of American Judicial review is summarized by constitutional legal scholars and historians as follows: the written Constitution is fundamental law. It can change only by extraordinary legislative process of national proposal, then state ratification. The powers of all departments are limited to enumerated grants found in the Constitution. Courts are expected (a) to enforce provisions of the Constitution as the supreme law of the land, and (b) to refuse to enforce anything in conflict with it.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=136}}\n\n'''In Convention.''' As to judicial review and the Congress, the first proposals by Madison (Va) and Wilson (Pa) called for a supreme court veto over national legislation. In this it resembled the system in New York, where the Constitution of 1777 called for a \"[[Council of Revision]]\" by the Governor and Justices of the state supreme court. The Council would review and in a way, veto any passed legislation violating the spirit of the Constitution before it went into effect. The nationalist's proposal in Convention was defeated three times, and replaced by a presidential veto with Congressional over-ride. Judicial review relies on the jurisdictional authority in Article III, and the Supremacy Clause.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nThe justification for judicial review is to be explicitly found in the open ratifications held in the states and reported in their newspapers. [[John Marshall]] in Virginia, [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] in Pennsylvania and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] of Connecticut all argued for Supreme Court judicial review of acts of state legislature. In [[Federalist No. 78]], Alexander Hamilton advocated the doctrine of a written document held as a superior enactment of the people. \"A limited constitution can be preserved in practice no other way\" than through courts which can declare void any legislation contrary to the Constitution. The preservation of the people's authority over legislatures rests \"particularly with judges\".{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=138}}{{refn|group= lower-alpha |The Supreme Court found 658 cases of invalid state statutes from 1790 to 1941 before the advent of civil rights cases in the last half of the twentieth century{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=142}}}}\n\nThe Supreme Court was initially made up of jurists who had been intimately connected with the framing of the Constitution and the establishment of its government as law. [[John Jay]] (New York), a co-author of ''The Federalist Papers'', served as Chief Justice for the first six years. The second Chief Justice for a term of four years, was [[Oliver Ellsworth]] (Connecticut), a delegate in the Constitutional Convention, as was [[John Rutledge]] (South Carolina), Washington's recess appointment as Chief Justice who served in 1795. [[John Marshall]] (Virginia), the fourth Chief Justice, had served in the Virginia Ratification Convention in 1788. His service on the Court would extend 34 years over some of the most important rulings to help establish the nation the Constitution had begun. In the first years of the Supreme Court, members of the Constitutional Convention who would serve included [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] (Pennsylvania) for ten years, [[John Blair Jr.]] (Virginia) for five, and [[John Rutledge]] (South Carolina) for one year as Justice, then Chief Justice in 1795.\n\n=== Establishment ===\nWhen John Marshall followed Oliver Ellsworth as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1801, the federal judiciary had been established by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789|Judiciary Act]], but there were few cases, and less prestige. \"The fate of judicial review was in the hands of the Supreme Court itself.\" Review of state legislation and appeals from state supreme courts was understood. But the Court's life, jurisdiction over state legislation was limited. The Marshall Court's landmark ''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'' held that the Bill of Rights restricted only the federal government, and not the states.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=138}}\n\nIn the landmark ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' case, the Supreme Court asserted its authority of judicial review over Acts of Congress.  Its findings were that Marbury and the others had a right to their commissions as judges in the District of Columbia.  Marshall, writing the opinion for the majority, announced his discovered conflict between Section 13 of the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] and Article III.{{refn|group= lower-alpha |In this, John Marshall leaned on the argument of Hamilton in [[Federalist No. 78]].}}{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=140}}{{refn|group= lower-alpha |Although it may be that the true meaning of the Constitution to the people of the United States in 1788 can only be divined by a study of the state ratification conventions, the Supreme Court has used ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' as a supplemental guide to the Constitution since their co-author, John Jay, was the first Chief Justice.}} In this case, both the Constitution and the statutory law applied to the particulars at the same time. \"The very essence of judicial duty\" according to Marshall was to determine which of the two conflicting rules should govern. The Constitution enumerates powers of the judiciary to extend to cases arising \"under the Constitution\". Further, justices take a Constitutional oath to uphold it as [[Supremacy Clause|\"Supreme law of the land\"]].{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=140\u2013141}} Therefore, since the United States government as created by the Constitution is a limited government, the Federal courts were required to choose the Constitution over Congressional law if there were deemed to be a conflict.\n\n\"This argument has been ratified by time and by practice...\"{{refn|group= lower-alpha |The entire quote reads, \"This argument has been ratified by time and by practice, and there is little point in quibbling with it. Of course, the President also takes an oath to support the Constitution.\"{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=141}}}}{{refn|group= lower-alpha |The presidential reference is to Andrew Jackson's disagreement with Marshall's Court over ''[[Worcester v.

Jackson would not politically interpose the U.S. Army between Georgia and the Cherokee people as Eisenhower would do between Arkansas and the integrating students.}}  The Supreme Court did not declare another Act of Congress unconstitutional until the controversial [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]] decision in 1857, held after the voided [[Missouri Compromise]] statute had already been repealed.  In the eighty years following the Civil War to World War II, the Court voided Congressional statutes in 77 cases, on average almost one a year.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\nSomething of a crisis arose when, in 1935 and 1936, the Supreme Court handed down twelve decisions voiding Acts of Congress relating to the New Deal. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] then responded with his abortive \"[[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|court packing plan]]\". Other proposals have suggested a Court super-majority to overturn Congressional legislation, or a Constitutional Amendment to require that the Justices retire at a specified age by law. To date, the Supreme Court's power of judicial review has persisted.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=142}}\n\n==== Self-restraint ====\nThe power of judicial review could not have been preserved long in a democracy unless it had been \"wielded with a reasonable measure of [[judicial restraint]], and with some attention, as [[Finley Peter Dunne|Mr. Dooley]] said, to the election returns.\" Indeed, the Supreme Court has developed a system of doctrine and practice that self-limits its power of judicial review.<!-- ref name=autogenerated11 -->{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=145}}\n\nThe Court controls almost all of its business by choosing what cases to consider, writs of [[certiorari]]. In this way, it can avoid opinions on embarrassing or difficult cases. The Supreme Court limits itself by defining for itself what is a \"justiciable question.\" First, the Court is fairly consistent in refusing to make any \"[[advisory opinion]]s\" in advance of actual cases.{{refn|group= lower-alpha |\"Advisory opinions\" are not the same as \"[[declaratory judgment]]s.\" (a) These address rights and legal relationships in cases of \"actual controversy\", and (b) the holding has the force and effect of a final judgment. (c) There is no coercive order, as the parties are assumed to follow the judgment, but a \"declaratory judgment\" is the basis of any subsequent ruling in case law.}} Second, \"[[friendly suit]]s\" between those of the same legal interest are not considered. Third, the Court requires a \"personal interest\", not one generally held, and a legally protected right must be immediately threatened by government action. Cases are not taken up if the litigant has no [[Standing (law)|standing to sue]]. Simply having the money to sue and being injured by government action are not enough.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=145}}\n\nThese three procedural ways of dismissing cases have led critics to charge that the Supreme Court delays decisions by unduly insisting on technicalities in their \"standards of litigability\".  They say cases are left unconsidered which are in the public interest, with genuine controversy, and resulting from good faith action.  \"The Supreme Court is not only a court of law but a court of justice.\"{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\n====Separation of powers====\nThe Supreme Court balances several pressures to maintain its roles in national government. It seeks to be a co-equal branch of government, but its decrees must be enforceable. The Court seeks to minimize situations where it asserts itself superior to either President or Congress, but federal officers must be held accountable. The Supreme Court assumes power to declare acts of Congress as unconstitutional but it self-limits its passing on constitutional questions.<!-- ref name=autogenerated5 -->{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=149}} But the Court's guidance on basic problems of life and governance in a democracy is most effective when American political life reinforce its rulings.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=154}}\n\n[[Louis Brandeis|Justice Brandeis]] summarized four general guidelines that the Supreme Court uses to avoid constitutional decisions relating to Congress:{{refn|group= lower-alpha |Louis Brandeis concurring opinion, ''Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority'', 1936.}} The Court will not anticipate a question of constitutional law nor decide open questions unless a case decision requires it. If it does, a rule of constitutional law is formulated only as the precise facts in the case require. The Court will choose statutes or general law for the basis of its decision if it can without constitutional grounds. If it does, the Court will choose a constitutional construction of an Act of Congress, even if its constitutionality is seriously in doubt. {{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=149}}\n\nLikewise with the Executive Department, Edwin Corwin observed that the Court does sometimes rebuff presidential pretensions, but it more often tries to rationalize them. Against Congress, an Act is merely \"disallowed\". In the executive case, exercising judicial review produces \"some change in the external world\" beyond the ordinary judicial sphere.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=150}} The \"political question\" doctrine especially applies to questions which present a difficult enforcement issue. Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] addressed the Court's limitation when political process allowed future policy change, but a judicial ruling would \"attribute finality\". Political questions lack \"satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination\".{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=151}}\n\nJohn Marshall recognized that the president holds \"important political powers\" which as [[Executive privilege]] allows great discretion. This doctrine was applied in Court rulings on President [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]]'s duty to enforce the law during [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]. It extends to the sphere of foreign affairs. Justice [[Robert H. Jackson|Robert Jackson]] explained, Foreign affairs are inherently political, \"wholly confided by our Constitution to the political departments of the government&nbsp;... [and] not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.\"{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nCritics of the Court object in two principal ways to self-restraint in judicial review, deferring as it does as a matter of doctrine to Acts of Congress and Presidential actions.\n# Its inaction is said to allow \"a flood of legislative appropriations\" which permanently create an imbalance between the states and federal government.\n# Supreme Court deference to Congress and the executive compromises American protection of civil rights, political minority groups and aliens.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=153}}\n{{Further|Separation of powers under the United States Constitution}}\n\n===Subsequent Courts===\n{{main |History of the Supreme Court of the United States }}\n\nSupreme Courts under the leadership of subsequent Chief Justices have also used judicial review to interpret the Constitution among individuals, states and federal branches. Notable contributions were made by the Chase Court, the Taft Court, the Warren Court, and the Rehnquist Court.\n\n{{further|List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Chase Court}}\n[[Salmon P. Chase]] was a Lincoln appointee, serving as Chief Justice from 1864 to 1873. His career encompassed service as a U.S. senator and Governor of Ohio. He coined the slogan, \"Free soil, free Labor, free men.\" One of Lincoln's \"team of rivals\", he was appointed Secretary of Treasury during the Civil War, issuing \"greenbacks\". To appease radical Republicans, Lincoln appointed him to replace Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] of [[Dred Scott]] case fame.\n\nIn one of his first official acts, Chase admitted [[John Rock (abolitionist)|John Rock]], the first African-American to practice before the Supreme Court. The \"Chase Court\" is famous for ''[[Texas v. White]]'', which asserted a permanent Union of indestructible states. ''[[Veazie Bank v. Fenno]]'' upheld the Civil War tax on state banknotes. ''[[Hepburn v. Griswold]]'' found parts of the Legal Tender Acts unconstitutional, though it was reversed under a late Supreme Court majority.\n\n{{further|List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Taft Court}}\n\n{|align=right\n|-\n|<center>Scope of judicial review expanded</center>\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Mathew_Brady,_Portrait_of_Secretary_of_the_Treasury_Salmon_P._Chase,_officer_of_the_United_States_government_(1860\u20131865,_full_version).jpg|'''[[Salmon P.

A [[Factions in the Republican Party (United States)#Progressive Republicans|Progressive Republican]] from Ohio, he was a one-term President.\n\nAs Chief Justice, he advocated the [[Judiciary Act of 1925]] that brought the Federal District Courts under the administrative jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Taft successfully sought the expansion of Court jurisdiction over non- states such as District of Columbia and Territories of Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nIn 1925, the Taft Court issued a ruling overturning a Marshall Court ruling on the Bill of Rights. In ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', the Court established the doctrine of \"[[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation]] which applied the Bill of Rights to the states. Important cases included the ''[[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen]]'' that upheld Congressional regulation of commerce. ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' allowed exclusion of evidence obtained without a warrant based on application of the 14th Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches. ''[[Wisconsin v. Illinois]]'' ruled the equitable power of the United States can impose positive action on a state to prevent its inaction from damaging another state.\n\n{{further|List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Warren Court}}\n[[Earl Warren]] was an Eisenhower nominee, Chief Justice from 1953 to 1969. Warren's Republican career in the law reached from County Prosecutor, California state attorney general, and three consecutive terms as Governor. His programs stressed progressive efficiency, expanding state education, re-integrating returning veterans, infrastructure and highway construction.\n\nIn 1954, the Warren Court overturned a landmark [[Melville Fuller#Chief Justice|Fuller Court]] ruling on the Fourteenth Amendment interpreting racial segregation as permissible in government and commerce providing \"separate but equal\" services. Warren built a coalition of Justices after 1962 that developed the idea of natural rights as guaranteed in the Constitution. ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' banned segregation in public schools. ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' and ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' established Court ordered \"one-man-one-vote\". Bill of Rights Amendments were incorporated into the states. Due process was expanded in ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' and ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]].'' First Amendment rights were addressed in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' concerning privacy, and ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' relative to free speech.\n\n{{further|List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court}}\n[[William Rehnquist]] was a Reagan appointment to Chief Justice, serving from 1986 to 2005. While he would concur with overthrowing a state supreme court's decision, as in ''Bush v. Gore'', he built a coalition of Justices after 1994 that developed the idea of federalism as provided for in the Tenth Amendment. In the hands of the Supreme Court, the Constitution and its Amendments were to restrain Congress, as in ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]''.\n\nNevertheless, the Rehnquist Court was noted in the contemporary \"culture wars\" for overturning state laws relating to privacy prohibiting late-term abortions in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', prohibiting sodomy in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', or ruling so as to protect free speech in ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'' or affirmative action in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]''.\n\n==Civic religion==\n{{Main|American civil religion}}\n\nThere is a viewpoint that some Americans have come to see the documents of the Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], as being a cornerstone of a type of [[civil religion]]. This is suggested by the prominent display of the Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, in massive, bronze-framed, bulletproof, moisture-controlled glass containers vacuum-sealed in a rotunda by day and in multi-ton bomb-proof vaults by night at the [[National Archives Building]].<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite news |last= Wood |first= Gordon S. |url= http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/aug/14/dusting-off-the-declaration/ |title= Dusting off the Declaration |work= The New York Review of Books |date= August 14, 1997 |accessdate= December 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of displaying the documents struck one academic critic looking from the point of view of the 1776 or 1789 America as \"idolatrous, and also curiously at odds with the values of the Revolution\".<ref name=\"Wood\"/> By 1816, Jefferson wrote that \"[s]ome men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the [[Ark of the Covenant]], too sacred to be touched\". But he saw imperfections and imagined that there could potentially be others, believing as he did that \"institutions must advance also\".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=115}}\n\nSome commentators depict the multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian United States as held together by a political orthodoxy, in contrast with a [[nation state]] of people having more \"natural\" ties.{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=118}}{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=119}}\n\n==Worldwide influence==\n{{Main|United States Constitution and worldwide influence}}\n{|align=right\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Jose rizal 01.jpg|'''[[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'''\nFile:Sun Yat-sen 2.jpg|'''[[Sun Yat-sen]]'''\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe United States Constitution has been a notable model for governance around the world.

The new frame of government that the Philadelphia Convention presented was technically only a revision of the Articles of Confederation. After several days of debate, Congress voted to transmit the document to the thirteen states for [[ratification]] according to the process outlined in its [[Article Seven of the United States Constitution|Article VII]].  Each state legislature was to call elections for a \"Federal Convention\" to ratify the new Constitution, rather than consider ratification itself; a departure from the constitutional practice of the time, designed to expand the [[Suffrage|franchise]] in order to more clearly embrace \"the people\".  The frame of government itself was to [[Coming into force|go into force]] among the States so acting upon the approval of nine (i.e. two-thirds of the 13) states; also a departure from constitutional practice, as the [[Articles of Confederation]] could only be amended by unanimous vote of all the states.\n\nThree members of the Convention&nbsp;\u2013 [[James Madison|Madison]], [[Nathaniel Gorham|Gorham]], and [[Rufus King|King]]&nbsp;\u2013 were also Members of Congress. They proceeded at once to New York, where Congress was in session, to placate the expected opposition. Aware of their vanishing authority, Congress, on September 28, after some debate, resolved unanimously to submit the Constitution to the States for action, \"in conformity to the resolves of the Convention\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/ressub02.asp|title=Resolution of Congress of September 28, 1787, Submitting the Constitution to the Several States|publisher=The [[Avalon Project]] at Yale Law School|accessdate=August 31, 2014}}</ref> but with no recommendation either for or against its adoption.\n\nTwo parties soon developed, one in opposition, the [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]], and one in support, the [[Federalist#United States|Federalists]], of the Constitution; and the Constitution was debated, criticized, and expounded upon clause by clause. [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]], [[James Madison|Madison]], and [[John Jay|Jay]], under the name of [[The Federalist Papers#Origins|Publius]], wrote a series of commentaries, now known as ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', in support of ratification in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], at that time a hotbed of anti-Federalism.  These commentaries on the Constitution, written during the struggle for ratification, have been frequently cited by the Supreme Court as an authoritative contemporary interpretation of the meaning of its provisions.  The dispute over additional powers for the central government was close, and in some states ratification was effected only after a bitter struggle in the state convention itself.\n\nOn June 21, 1788, the constitution had been ratified by the minimum of nine states required under Article VII.  Towards the end of July, and with eleven states then having ratified, the process of organizing the new government began.  The Continental Congress, which still functioned at irregular intervals, passed a resolution on September 13, 1788, to put the new Constitution into operation with the eleven states that had then ratified it.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolu01.asp\n |title= Resolution of the Congress, of September 13, 1788, Fixing Date for Election of a President, and the Organization of the Government Under the Constitution, in the City of New York\n |via= [[Avalon Project]] }}</ref> The federal government began operations under the new form of government on March 4, 1789.

These were associated with the combination of consolidated government along with federal relationships with constituent states.\n\nThe [[Due Process Clause]] of the Constitution was partly based on [[common law]] and on [[Magna Carta]] (1215), which had become a foundation of English liberty against arbitrary power wielded by a ruler.\n\nAmong the most prominent political theorists of the late eighteenth century were [[William Blackstone]], [[John Locke]], and [[Montesquieu]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Manning |first=John F.|date=2011 |title=Separation of Powers as Ordinary Interpretation |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=1939\u20132039 }}</ref>\n\nBoth the influence of [[Edward Coke]] and William Blackstone were evident at the Convention. In his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'', Edward Coke interpreted Magna Carta protections and rights to apply not just to nobles, but to all British subjects. In writing the [[London Company|Virginia Charter of 1606]], he enabled the King in Parliament to give those to be born in the colonies all rights and liberties as though they were born in England. William Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' were the most influential books on law in the new republic.\n\nBritish political philosopher John Locke following the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688) was a major influence expanding on the contract theory of government advanced by [[Thomas Hobbes]]. Locke advanced the principle of [[consent of the governed]] in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Government's duty under a [[social contract]] among the sovereign people was to serve the people by protecting their rights. These basic rights were [[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness#Lockean roots hypothesis|life, liberty and property]].\n\nMontesquieu's influence on the framers is evident in Madison's [[Federalist No. 47]] and Hamilton's [[Federalist No. 78]].

It neither assigns powers to the federal government,<ref>''See [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]]'', 197 U.S. 11, 22 (1905) (\"Although th[e] preamble indicates the general purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution, it has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on the government of the United States, or on any of its departments.\"); ''see also United States v. Boyer'', 85 F. 425, 430\u201331 (W.D. Mo. 1898) (\"The preamble never can be resorted to, to enlarge the powers confided to the general government, or any of its departments. It cannot confer any power ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. It can never amount, by implication, to an enlargement of any power expressly given. It can never be the legitimate source of any implied power, when otherwise withdrawn from the constitution. Its true office is to expound the nature and extent and application of the powers actually conferred by the constitution, and not substantively to create them.\" (quoting 1 JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES \u00a7 462 (1833)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</ref> nor does it place specific limitations on government action. Rather, it sets out the origin, scope and purpose of the Constitution. Its origin and authority is in \"We, the people of the United States\". This echoes the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. \"One people\" dissolved their connection with another, and assumed among the powers of the earth, a sovereign nation-state. The scope of the Constitution is twofold. First, \"to form a more perfect Union\" than had previously existed in the \"perpetual Union\" of the Articles of Confederation. Second, to \"secure the blessings of liberty\", which were to be enjoyed by not only the first generation, but for all who came after, \"our posterity\".{{sfn|Adler|Gorman|1975|p=26, 80, 136}}\n\n===Article One===\n[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] describes the [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[legislature|legislative branch]] of the federal government. Section 1, reads, \"All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].\" The article establishes the manner of [[Elections in the United States|election]] and the qualifications of members of each body. Representatives must be at least 25 years old, be a citizen of the United States for seven years, and live in the state they represent. Senators must be at least 30 years old, be a citizen for nine years, and live in the state they represent.\n\n[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8]] enumerates the powers delegated to the legislature. Financially, Congress has the power to tax, borrow, pay debt and provide for the common defense and the general welfare; to regulate commerce, bankruptcies, and coin money. To regulate internal affairs, it has the power to regulate and govern military forces and militias, suppress insurrections and repel invasions. It is to provide for naturalization, standards of weights and measures, post offices and roads, and patents; to directly govern the federal district and cessions of land by the states for forts and arsenals. Internationally, Congress has the power to define and punish piracies and offenses against the Law of Nations, to declare war and make rules of war. The final [[Necessary and Proper Clause]], also known as the Elastic Clause, expressly confers incidental powers upon Congress without the Articles' requirement for express delegation for each and every power. [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, Section 9]] lists eight specific limits on congressional power.\n\nThe Supreme Court has sometimes broadly interpreted the [[Commerce Clause]] and the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] in Article One to allow Congress to enact legislation that is neither expressly allowed by the [[Enumerated powers (United States)|enumerated powers]] nor expressly denied in the limitations on Congress. In ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), the Supreme Court read the Necessary and Proper Clause to permit the federal government to take action that would \"enable [it] to perform the high duties assigned to it [by the Constitution] in the manner most beneficial to the people\",<ref name=\"17US421\">17. U.S. at 421</ref> even if that action is not itself within the enumerated powers. [[John Marshall|Chief Justice Marshall]] clarified: \"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are Constitutional.\"<ref name=\"17US421\" />\n\n===Article Two===\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] describes the office, qualifications, and duties of the [[President of the United States]] and the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. The President is head of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], as well as the nation's [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].\n\nArticle two is modified by the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]] which tacitly acknowledges political parties, and the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] relating to office succession. The president is to receive only one compensation from the federal government. The inaugural oath is specified to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\n\nThe president is the [[Commander-in-chief|Commander in Chief]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and state militias when they are mobilized. He or she makes treaties [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Advice and Consent Clause|with the advice and consent]] of a two-thirds quorum of the Senate. To administer the federal government, the president commissions all the offices of the federal government as Congress directs; he or she may require the opinions of its principal officers and make \"[[Recess appointment|recess appointments]]\" for vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate. The president is to see that the laws are faithfully executed, though he or she may grant reprieves and pardons except regarding Congressional [[impeachment]] of himself or other federal officers. The president reports to Congress on the [[State of the Union]], and by the [[Recommendation Clause]], recommends \"necessary and expedient\" national measures. The president may convene and adjourn Congress under special circumstances.\n\nSection 4 provides for removal of the president and other federal officers. The president is removed on [[impeachment]] for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n===Article Three===\n[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three]] describes the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|court system]] (the [[judiciary|judicial branch]]), including the Supreme Court. There shall be one court called the Supreme Court. The article describes the kinds of cases the court takes as [[original jurisdiction]]. Congress can create lower courts and an appeals process. Congress enacts law defining crimes and providing for punishment. Article Three also protects the right to [[jury trial|trial by jury]] in all [[criminal law|criminal cases]], and defines the crime of [[treason]].\n\nSection 1 vests the judicial power of the United States in federal courts, and with it, the authority to interpret and apply the law to a particular case. Also included is the power to punish, sentence, and direct future action to resolve conflicts. The Constitution outlines the U.S. judicial system. In the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], Congress began to fill in details. Currently, Title 28 of the U.S. Code{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}} describes judicial powers and administration.\n\nAs of the First Congress, the Supreme Court justices rode circuit to sit as panels to hear appeals from the [[United States district court|district courts]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] established six Supreme Court justices. The number was periodically increased, reaching ten in 1863, allowing Lincoln additional appointments. After the Civil War, vacancies reduced the number to seven. Congress finally fixed the number at nine.}} In 1891, Congress enacted a new system. District courts would have [[original jurisdiction]]. Intermediate appellate courts (circuit courts) with [[exclusive jurisdiction]] heard regional appeals before consideration by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court holds [[discretionary jurisdiction]], meaning that it does not have to hear every case that is brought to it.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}\n\nTo enforce judicial decisions, the Constitution grants federal courts both [[Contempt of court|criminal contempt]] and [[Contempt of court|civil contempt]] powers. The court's summary punishment for contempt immediately overrides all other punishments applicable to the subject party. Other implied powers include injunctive relief and the habeas corpus remedy. The Court may imprison for [[contumacy]], bad-faith litigation, and failure to obey a writ of [[mandamus]]. Judicial power includes that granted by Acts of Congress for rules of law and punishment. Judicial power also extends to areas not covered by statute. Generally, federal courts cannot interrupt state court proceedings.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}\n\n[[Case or Controversy Clause|Clause 1 of Section 2]] authorizes the federal courts to hear actual cases and controversies only. Their judicial power does not extend to cases which are hypothetical, or which are proscribed due to [[Standing (law)|standing]], [[mootness]], or [[ripeness]] issues. Generally, a case or controversy requires the presence of adverse parties who have some interest genuinely at stake in the case.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The four concepts which determine \"justiciability\", the formula for a federal court taking and deciding a case, are the doctrines of (a) standing, (b) real and substantial interests, (c) adversity, and (d) avoidance of political questions.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}}\n\nClause 2 of Section 2 provides that the Supreme Court has [[original jurisdiction]] in cases involving ambassadors, ministers and consuls, for all cases respecting foreign nation-states,<ref>[http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/constitution/ FindLaw for legal professionals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116032730/http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/constitution/ |date=January 16, 2013 }}, with links to United States Government Printing office official Web site, Cornell Law School, Emory Law School, and U.S. Supreme Court decisions since 1893, (1998, 2000 Supplement).

Cases arising under the laws of the United States and its treaties come under the jurisdiction of federal courts. Cases under international maritime law and conflicting land grants of different states come under federal courts. Cases between U.S. citizens in different states, and cases between U.S. citizens and foreign states and their citizens, come under federal jurisdiction. The trials will be in the state where the crime was committed.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}\n\nNo part of the Constitution expressly authorizes [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Judicial review|judicial review]], but the Framers did contemplate the idea. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Precedent has since established that the courts could exercise judicial review over the actions of Congress or the executive branch. Two conflicting federal laws are under \"pendent\" jurisdiction if one presents a strict constitutional issue. Federal court jurisdiction is rare when a state legislature enacts something as under federal jurisdiction.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Judicial Review is explained in Hamilton's [[Federalist No. 78]]. It also has roots in Natural Law expressions in the Declaration of Independence. The Supreme Court first ruled an act of Congress unconstitutional in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', the second was [[Dred Scott]].{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}} To establish a federal system of national law, considerable effort goes into developing a spirit of [[comity]] between federal government and states. By the doctrine of '[[Res judicata]]', federal courts give \"full faith and credit\" to State Courts.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For instance, 'collateral estoppel' directs that when a litigant wins in a state court, they cannot sue in federal court to get a more favorable outcome.}} The Supreme Court will decide Constitutional issues of state law only on a case by case basis, and only by strict Constitutional necessity, independent of state legislators' motives, their policy outcomes or its national wisdom.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Recently numerous [[habeas corpus]] reforms have tried to preserve a working \"relationship of comity\" and simultaneously streamline the process for state and lower courts to apply Supreme Court interpretations.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}}\n\nSection 3 bars Congress from changing or modifying Federal [[Treason laws in the United States|law on treason]] by simple majority statute.  This section also defines treason, as an [[overt act]] of making war or materially helping those at war with the United States.  Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses.  Congress is a political body and political disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason.  This allows for nonviolent resistance to the government because opposition is not a life or death proposition.  However, Congress does provide for other lesser subversive crimes such as [[List of political conspiracies|conspiracy]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Contrary to this source when viewed, the Constitution provides that punishments, including forfeiture of income and property, must apply to the person convicted. \"No attainder of treason shall work [[Attainder#Corruption of blood|corruption of blood]] or forfeiture\" on the convicted traitor's children or heirs. This avoids the perpetuation of civil war into the generations by Parliamentary majorities as in the [[Wars of the Roses]].{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}}\n\n===Article Four===\n[[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article Four]] outlines the relations among the states and between each state and the federal government. In addition, it provides for such matters as [[admission to the Union|admitting new states]] and border changes between the states.  For instance, it requires states to give \"[[Full Faith and Credit Clause|full faith and credit]]\" to the public acts, records, and court proceedings of the other states.  Congress is permitted to [[regulation|regulate]] the manner in which proof of such acts may be admitted.  The [[Privileges and Immunities Clause|\"privileges and immunities\" clause]] prohibits state governments from discriminating against citizens of other states in favor of resident citizens. For instance, in [[Criminal sentencing in the United States|criminal sentencing]], a state may not increase a penalty on the grounds that the convicted person is a non-resident.\n\nIt also establishes [[extradition]] between the states, as well as laying down a legal basis for [[freedom of movement]] and travel amongst the states. Today, this provision is sometimes taken for granted, but in the days of the [[Articles of Confederation]], crossing state lines was often arduous and costly. The [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Federal property and the Territorial Clause|Territorial Clause]] gives Congress the power to make rules for disposing of federal property and governing non-state territories of the United States.  Finally, the fourth section of Article Four requires the United States to guarantee to each state a [[Republic|republican form of government]], and to protect them from invasion and violence.\n\n===Article Five===\n[[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article Five]] outlines the process for amending the Constitution. Eight state constitutions in effect in 1787 included an amendment mechanism. Amendment making power rested with the legislature in three of the states and in the other five it was given to specially elected conventions. The Articles of Confederation provided that amendments were to be proposed by Congress and ratified by the unanimous vote of all thirteen state legislatures. This proved to be a major flaw in the Articles, as it created an insurmountable obstacle to constitutional reform. The amendment process crafted during the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention was, according to The [[Federalist No. 43]], designed to establish a balance between pliancy and rigidity:<ref>{{cite web |last1= England |first1= Trent |last2= Spalding |first2= Matthew |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Essays on Article V: Amendments |url= http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/129/amendments |publisher= The Heritage Foundation |accessdate= July 31, 2014}}</ref>\n{{quote|It guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the Constitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults. It moreover equally enables the General and the State Governments to originate the amendment of errors, as they may be pointed out by the experience on one side, or on the other.}}\n\nThere are two steps in the amendment process. Proposals to amend the Constitution must be properly adopted and ratified before they change the Constitution. First, there are two procedures for adopting the language of a proposed amendment, either by (a) [[United States Congress|Congress]], by [[Supermajority|two-thirds majority]] in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, or (b) [[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution|national convention]] (which shall take place whenever two-thirds of the state legislatures collectively call for one). Second, there are two procedures for ratifying the proposed amendment, which requires three-fourths of the states' (presently 38 of 50) approval: (a) consent of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]], or (b) consent of [[state ratifying conventions]]. The ratification method is chosen by Congress for each amendment.<ref name=Clayton>{{cite web |url= http://www.clayton.edu/arts-sciences/Constitution-Day/Proposed-Amendments |title= Proposed Amendments |work= Constitution Day Observance Events |publisher= Clayton State University}}</ref> State ratifying conventions were used only once, for the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Toward a Theory of Constitutional Amendment |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=355\u2013370 |last=Lutz |first=Donald |year=1994|doi=10.2307/2944709 |jstor=2944709 }}</ref>\n\nPresently, the [[Archivist of the United States]] is charged with responsibility for administering the ratification process under the provisions of [[Title 1 of the United States Code|1 U.S. Code]] {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|1|106b}}.

Article One, Section 9, Clauses 1 prevents Congress from passing any law that would restrict the [[History of slavery|importation of slaves]] into the United States prior to 1808, plus the fourth clause from that same section, which reiterates the Constitutional rule that [[direct tax]]es must be apportioned according to state populations. These clauses were explicitly shielded from Constitutional amendment prior to 1808. On January 1, 1808, the first day it was permitted to do so, Congress approved legislation [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibiting the importation of slaves]] into the country. On February 3, 1913, with ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], Congress gained the authority to levy an [[income tax]] without apportioning it among [[U.S. state|the states]] or basing it on the [[United States Census]]. The third textually entrenched provision is Article One, Section 3, Clauses 1, which provides for equal representation of the states in the Senate. The shield protecting this clause from the amendment process is less absolute&nbsp;\u2013 \"no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate\"&nbsp;\u2013 but permanent.\n\n===Article Six===\n[[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article Six]] establishes the Constitution, and all federal laws and treaties of the United States made according to it, to be the [[Supremacy Clause|supreme law]] of the land, and that \"the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the laws or constitutions of any state notwithstanding.\" It validates [[government debt|national debt]] created under the Articles of Confederation and requires that all federal and state legislators, officers, and judges take oaths or affirmations to support the Constitution. This means that the states' constitutions and laws should not conflict with the laws of the federal constitution and that in case of a conflict, state judges are legally bound to honor the federal laws and constitution over those of any state. Article Six also states \"[[No Religious Test Clause|no religious Test]] shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\"\n\n===Article Seven===\n[[Article Seven of the United States Constitution|Article Seven]] describes the process for establishing the proposed new frame of government. Anticipating that the influence of many state politicians would be Antifederalist, delegates to the Philadelphia Convention provided for [[ratification]] of the Constitution by popularly elected [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|ratifying conventions]] in each state. The convention method also made it possible that judges, ministers and others ineligible to serve in state legislatures, could be elected to a convention. Suspecting that Rhode Island, at least, might not ratify, delegates decided that the Constitution would go into effect as soon as nine states (two-thirds rounded up) ratified.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Samuel Eliot Morison |first= Samuel Eliot |last= Morison |title= The Oxford History of the American People |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryof00mori |url-access=registration |year= 1965 |location= Oxford |publisher= Oxford University Press |page= [https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryof00mori/page/312 312]}}</ref> Once ratified by this minimum number of states, it was anticipated that the proposed Constitution would become ''this Constitution'' between the nine or more that signed.

In addition to signatures, this closing endorsement, the Constitution's [[eschatocol]], included a brief declaration that the delegates' work has been successfully completed and that those whose signatures appear on it subscribe to the final document. Included are a statement pronouncing the document's adoption by the states present, a formulaic dating of its adoption, and the signatures of those endorsing it. Additionally, the convention's secretary, [[William Jackson (secretary)|William Jackson]], added a note to verify four amendments made by hand to the final document, and signed the note to authenticate its validity.<ref>Madison, James (1902) ''The Writings of [[James Madison]]'', [https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/madison-the-writings-vol-4-1787 vol. 4, ''1787: The Journal of the Constitutional Convention, Part II''] (edited by G. Hunt), pp. 501\u2013502</ref>\n\nThe language of the concluding endorsement, conceived by [[Gouverneur Morris]] and presented to the convention by [[Benjamin Franklin]], was made intentionally ambiguous in hopes of winning over the votes of dissenting delegates. Advocates for the new frame of government, realizing the impending difficulty of obtaining the consent of the states needed to make it operational, were anxious to obtain the unanimous support of the delegations from each state. It was feared that many of the delegates would refuse to give their individual assent to the Constitution. Therefore, in order that the action of the Convention would appear to be unanimous, the formula, ''Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present ...'' was devised.<ref name=attest>{{cite web|last1=Spaulding|first1=Matthew|title=Attestation Clause|url= http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/7/essays/137/attestation-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe document is dated: \"the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord\" 1787, and \"of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth.\"  This two-fold [[epoch]] dating serves to place the Constitution in the context of the religious traditions of [[Western culture|Western civilization]] and, at the same time, links it to the [[regime]] principles proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence.  This dual reference can also be found in the Articles of Confederation and the [[Northwest Ordinance]].<ref name=attest/>\n\nThe closing endorsement serves an [[authentication]] function only. It neither assigns powers to the federal government nor does it provide specific limitations on government action. It does however, provide essential [[Evidence (law)|documentation]] of the Constitution's validity, a statement of \"This is what was agreed to.\" It records who signed the Constitution, and when and where.\n\n==Amending the Constitution==\nThe procedure for amending the Constitution is outlined in Article Five (see [[#Article Five|above]]). The process is overseen by the [[archivist of the United States]]. Between 1949 and 1985 it was overseen by the [[General Services Administration|administrator of General Services]], and before that by the [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]].<ref name=register/>\n\nUnder Article Five, a proposal for an amendment must be adopted either by Congress or by a national convention, but {{as of|2020|lc=yes}} all amendments have gone through Congress.<ref name=register/> The proposal must receive two thirds of the votes of both houses to proceed. It is passed as a [[joint resolution]], but is not presented to the president, who plays no part in the process. Instead, it is passed to the Office of the Federal Register, which copies it in [[slip law]] format and submits it to the states.<ref name=register/> Congress decides whether the proposal is to be ratified in the state legislature or  by a state ratifying convention. To date all amendments have been ratified by the state legislatures except one, the Twenty-first Amendment.<ref name=Clayton/>\n\nA proposed amendment becomes an operative part of the Constitution as soon as it is ratified by three-fourths of the States (currently 38 of the 50 states). There is no further step. The text requires no additional action by Congress or anyone else after ratification by the required number of states.<ref>{{cite web |last= Neale |first= Thomas H. |title= The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues |url= http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/misc/CRS_2013_summary.pdf |publisher= Congressional Research Service |accessdate= July 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140831102306/http://equalrightsamendment.org/misc/CRS_2013_summary.pdf |archivedate= August 31, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Thus, when the Office of the Federal Register verifies that it has received the required number of authenticated ratification documents, it drafts a formal proclamation for the Archivist to certify that the amendment is valid and has become part of the nation's frame of government.

Structurally, the Constitution's original text and all prior amendments remain untouched. The precedent for this [[Constitutional amendment#Form of changes to the text|practice]] was set in 1789, when [[1st United States Congress|Congress]] considered and proposed the first several Constitutional amendments. Among these, Amendments 1\u201310 are collectively known as the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], and Amendments 13\u201315 are known as the [[Reconstruction Amendments]]. Excluding the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]], which was pending before the states for {{Age in years and days|1789|09|25|1992|05|07}}, the longest pending amendment that was successfully ratified was the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], which took {{Age in years and days|1947|03|21|1951|02|27}}. The [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] was ratified in the shortest time, {{Age in days|1971|03|23|1971|07|01}} days. The [[Arithmetic mean|average]] ratification time for the first twenty-six amendments was 1 year, 252 days; for all twenty-seven, 9 years, 48 days.\n\n===Safeguards of liberty (Amendments 1, 2, and 3)===\nThe [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (1791) prohibits Congress from obstructing the exercise of certain individual freedoms: [[Freedom of religion in the United States|freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of assembly]], and [[right to petition]]. Its [[Free Exercise Clause]] guarantees a person's right to hold whatever religious beliefs he or she wants, and to freely exercise that belief, and its [[Establishment Clause]] prevents the federal government from creating an official national church or favoring one set of religious beliefs over another. The amendment guarantees an individual's right to express and to be exposed to a wide range of opinions and views. It was intended to ensure a free exchange of ideas, even unpopular ones.  It also guarantees an individual's right to physically gather or associate with others in groups for economic, political or religious purposes.  Additionally, it guarantees an individual's right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment I |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-1-freedom-of-religion-press-expression |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] (1791)  protects the right of individuals<ref>{{cite court |litigants= Fletcher v.

A search can mean everything from a frisking by a police officer or to a demand for a blood test to a search of an individual's home or car. A seizure occurs when the government takes control of an individual or something in his or her possession. Items that are seized often are used as evidence when the individual is charged with a crime. It also imposes certain limitations on police investigating a crime and prevents the use of illegally obtained evidence at trial.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment IV |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-4-search-and-seizure |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] (1791) establishes the requirement that a [[trial]] for a major [[crime]] may commence only after an [[indictment]] has been handed down by a [[grand jury]]; protects individuals from [[double jeopardy]], being tried and put in danger of being punished more than once for the same criminal act; prohibits punishment without [[due process]] of law, thus protecting individuals from being imprisoned without fair procedures; and provides that an accused person may not be compelled to reveal to the police, prosecutor, judge, or jury any information that might [[self-incrimination|incriminate or be used against]] him or her in a court of law. Additionally, the Fifth Amendment also prohibits government from taking private property for public use without \"[[just compensation]]\", the basis of [[eminent domain]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment V |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-5-trial-and-punishment-compensation-for-takings |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] (1791) provides several protections and rights to an individual accused of a crime. The accused has the right to a fair and speedy trial by a local and impartial [[jury]]. Likewise, a person has the right to a public trial. This right protects defendants from secret proceedings that might encourage abuse of the justice system, and serves to keep the public informed. This amendment also guarantees a right to [[Lawyer|legal counsel]] if accused of a crime, guarantees that the accused may require [[witness]]es to attend the trial and testify in the presence of the accused, and guarantees the accused a right to know the charges against them. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled that, with the Fifth Amendment, this amendment requires what has become known as the [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment VI |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-6-right-to-speedy-trial-confrontation-of-witnesses |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] (1791) extends the right to a [[jury trial]] to federal [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] cases, and inhibits courts from overturning a jury's [[Question of law|findings of fact]]. Although the Seventh Amendment itself says that it is limited to \"suits at common law\", meaning cases that triggered the right to a jury under English law, the amendment has been found to apply in lawsuits that are similar to the old common law cases. For example, the right to a jury trial applies to cases brought under federal statutes that prohibit race or gender discrimination in housing or employment. Importantly, this amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial only in federal court, not in state court.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment VII |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-7-trial-by-jury-in-civil-cases |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] (1791) protects people from having [[bail]] or [[fine (penalty)|fines]] set at an amount so high that it would be impossible for all but the richest defendants to pay and also protects people from being subjected to [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. Although this phrase originally was intended to outlaw certain gruesome methods of punishment, it has been broadened over the years to protect against punishments that are grossly disproportionate to or too harsh for the particular crime. This provision has also been used to challenge prison conditions such as extremely unsanitary cells, overcrowding, insufficient medical care and deliberate failure by officials to protect inmates from one another.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment VIII |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-8-cruel-and-unusual-punishment |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Unenumerated rights and reserved powers (Amendments 9 and 10) ===\nThe [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] (1791) declares that individuals have other fundamental rights, in addition to those stated in the Constitution. During the Constitutional ratification debates Anti-Federalists argued that a Bill of Rights should be added.  The Federalists opposed it on grounds that a list would necessarily be incomplete but would be taken as [[enumerative definition|explicit and exhaustive]], thus enlarging the power of the federal government by implication.  The Anti-Federalists persisted, and several state ratification conventions refused to ratify the Constitution without a more specific list of protections, so the First Congress added what became the Ninth Amendment as a compromise. Because the rights protected by the Ninth Amendment are not specified, they are referred to as \"unenumerated\".  The Supreme Court has found that unenumerated rights include such important rights as the right to travel, the right to vote, the right to privacy, and the right to make important decisions about one's health care or body.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment IX |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-9-construction-of-constitution |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] (1791) was included in the Bill of Rights to further define the balance of power between the federal government and the states. The amendment states that the federal government has only those powers specifically granted by the Constitution. These powers include the power to declare war, to collect taxes, to regulate interstate business activities and others that are listed in the articles or in subsequent constitutional amendments. Any power not listed is, says the Tenth Amendment, left to the states or the people. While there is no specific list of what these \"reserved powers\" may be, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws affecting family relations, commerce within a state's own borders, and local law enforcement activities, are among those specifically reserved to the states or the people.<ref>{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment X |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-10-powers-of-the-states-and-people |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Governmental authority (Amendments 11, 16, 18, and 21)===\nThe [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] (1795) specifically prohibits federal courts from hearing cases in which a state is sued by an individual from another state or another country, thus extending to the states [[Sovereign immunity in the United States|sovereign immunity]] protection from certain types of legal liability. [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Cases and controversies|Article Three, Section 2, Clause 1]] has been affected by this amendment, which also overturned the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Chisholm v.

Specifically, the apportionment constraints delineated in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Apportionment of direct taxes|Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4]] have been removed by this amendment, which also overturned an 1895 Supreme Court decision, in  ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]'', that declared an unapportioned federal income tax on rents, dividends, and interest unconstitutional. This amendment has become the basis for all subsequent federal income tax legislation and has greatly expanded the scope of federal taxing and spending in the years since.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XVI|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-16-status-of-income-tax-clarified|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] (1919) prohibited the making, transporting, and selling of alcoholic beverages nationwide. It also authorized Congress to enact legislation enforcing this prohibition. Adopted at the urging of a national [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance movement]], proponents believed that the use of alcohol was reckless and destructive and that [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] would reduce crime and corruption, solve social problems, decrease the need for welfare and prisons, and improve the health of all Americans. During prohibition, it is estimated that alcohol consumption and alcohol related deaths declined dramatically. But prohibition had other, more negative consequences. The amendment drove the lucrative alcohol business underground, giving rise to a large and pervasive [[Rum-running|black market]]. In addition, prohibition encouraged disrespect for the law and strengthened [[organized crime]]. Prohibition came to an end in 1933, when this amendment was repealed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XVIII|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-18-liquor-abolished|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]] (1933) repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and returned the regulation of alcohol to the states. Each state sets its own rules for the sale and importation of alcohol, including the drinking age.

These decisions are referred to as [[precedent]]s. Judicial review is the power of the Court to examine federal legislation, federal executive, and all state branches of government, to decide their [[constitutionality]], and to strike them down if found unconstitutional.\n\nJudicial review includes the power of the Court to explain the meaning of the Constitution as it applies to particular cases. Over the years, Court decisions on issues ranging from governmental regulation of [[radio]] and [[television]] to the rights of the accused in criminal cases have changed the way many constitutional clauses are interpreted, without amendment to the actual text of the Constitution.\n\nLegislation passed to implement the Constitution, or to adapt those implementations to changing conditions, broadens and, in subtle ways, changes the meanings given to the words of the Constitution. Up to a point, the rules and regulations of the many federal executive agencies have a similar effect. If an action of Congress or the agencies is challenged, however, it is the court system that ultimately decides whether these actions are permissible under the Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court has indicated that once the Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the Courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say \"what the law is\".{{refn|group= lower-alpha |[[Downes v.

First, they have jurisdiction over actions by an officer of government and state law. Second, federal courts may rule on whether coordinate branches of national government conform to the Constitution. Until the twentieth century, the Supreme Court of the United States may have been the only high tribunal in the world to use a court for constitutional interpretation of fundamental law, others generally depending on their national legislature.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=134}}\n\n{|align=right\n|-\n|<center>Early Court roots in the founding</center>\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:John Jay (Gilbert Stuart portrait).jpg|[[John Jay]], <small>1789\u20131795<br />New York co-author<br />''[[The Federalist Papers]]''</small>\nFile:John Marshall by Henry Inman, 1832.jpg|[[John Marshall]], <small>1801\u20131835<br />[[Fauquier County, Virginia|Fauquier County]] delegate<br />Virginia Ratification Convention</small>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe basic theory of American Judicial review is summarized by constitutional legal scholars and historians as follows: the written Constitution is fundamental law. It can change only by extraordinary legislative process of national proposal, then state ratification. The powers of all departments are limited to enumerated grants found in the Constitution. Courts are expected (a) to enforce provisions of the Constitution as the supreme law of the land, and (b) to refuse to enforce anything in conflict with it.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=136}}\n\n'''In Convention.''' As to judicial review and the Congress, the first proposals by Madison (Va) and Wilson (Pa) called for a supreme court veto over national legislation. In this it resembled the system in New York, where the Constitution of 1777 called for a \"[[Council of Revision]]\" by the Governor and Justices of the state supreme court. The Council would review and in a way, veto any passed legislation violating the spirit of the Constitution before it went into effect. The nationalist's proposal in Convention was defeated three times, and replaced by a presidential veto with Congressional over-ride. Judicial review relies on the jurisdictional authority in Article III, and the Supremacy Clause.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nThe justification for judicial review is to be explicitly found in the open ratifications held in the states and reported in their newspapers. [[John Marshall]] in Virginia, [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] in Pennsylvania and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] of Connecticut all argued for Supreme Court judicial review of acts of state legislature. In [[Federalist No. 78]], Alexander Hamilton advocated the doctrine of a written document held as a superior enactment of the people. \"A limited constitution can be preserved in practice no other way\" than through courts which can declare void any legislation contrary to the Constitution. The preservation of the people's authority over legislatures rests \"particularly with judges\".{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=138}}{{refn|group= lower-alpha |The Supreme Court found 658 cases of invalid state statutes from 1790 to 1941 before the advent of civil rights cases in the last half of the twentieth century{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=142}}}}\n\nThe Supreme Court was initially made up of jurists who had been intimately connected with the framing of the Constitution and the establishment of its government as law. [[John Jay]] (New York), a co-author of ''The Federalist Papers'', served as Chief Justice for the first six years. The second Chief Justice for a term of four years, was [[Oliver Ellsworth]] (Connecticut), a delegate in the Constitutional Convention, as was [[John Rutledge]] (South Carolina), Washington's recess appointment as Chief Justice who served in 1795. [[John Marshall]] (Virginia), the fourth Chief Justice, had served in the Virginia Ratification Convention in 1788. His service on the Court would extend 34 years over some of the most important rulings to help establish the nation the Constitution had begun. In the first years of the Supreme Court, members of the Constitutional Convention who would serve included [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] (Pennsylvania) for ten years, [[John Blair Jr.]] (Virginia) for five, and [[John Rutledge]] (South Carolina) for one year as Justice, then Chief Justice in 1795.\n\n=== Establishment ===\nWhen John Marshall followed Oliver Ellsworth as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1801, the federal judiciary had been established by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789|Judiciary Act]], but there were few cases, and less prestige. \"The fate of judicial review was in the hands of the Supreme Court itself.\" Review of state legislation and appeals from state supreme courts was understood. But the Court's life, jurisdiction over state legislation was limited. The Marshall Court's landmark ''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'' held that the Bill of Rights restricted only the federal government, and not the states.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=138}}\n\nIn the landmark ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' case, the Supreme Court asserted its authority of judicial review over Acts of Congress.  Its findings were that Marbury and the others had a right to their commissions as judges in the District of Columbia.  Marshall, writing the opinion for the majority, announced his discovered conflict between Section 13 of the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] and Article III.{{refn|group= lower-alpha |In this, John Marshall leaned on the argument of Hamilton in [[Federalist No. 78]].}}{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=140}}{{refn|group= lower-alpha |Although it may be that the true meaning of the Constitution to the people of the United States in 1788 can only be divined by a study of the state ratification conventions, the Supreme Court has used ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' as a supplemental guide to the Constitution since their co-author, John Jay, was the first Chief Justice.}} In this case, both the Constitution and the statutory law applied to the particulars at the same time. \"The very essence of judicial duty\" according to Marshall was to determine which of the two conflicting rules should govern. The Constitution enumerates powers of the judiciary to extend to cases arising \"under the Constitution\". Further, justices take a Constitutional oath to uphold it as [[Supremacy Clause|\"Supreme law of the land\"]].{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=140\u2013141}} Therefore, since the United States government as created by the Constitution is a limited government, the Federal courts were required to choose the Constitution over Congressional law if there were deemed to be a conflict.\n\n\"This argument has been ratified by time and by practice...\"{{refn|group= lower-alpha |The entire quote reads, \"This argument has been ratified by time and by practice, and there is little point in quibbling with it.

In the eighty years following the Civil War to World War II, the Court voided Congressional statutes in 77 cases, on average almost one a year.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\nSomething of a crisis arose when, in 1935 and 1936, the Supreme Court handed down twelve decisions voiding Acts of Congress relating to the New Deal. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] then responded with his abortive \"[[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|court packing plan]]\". Other proposals have suggested a Court super-majority to overturn Congressional legislation, or a Constitutional Amendment to require that the Justices retire at a specified age by law. To date, the Supreme Court's power of judicial review has persisted.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=142}}\n\n==== Self-restraint ====\nThe power of judicial review could not have been preserved long in a democracy unless it had been \"wielded with a reasonable measure of [[judicial restraint]], and with some attention, as [[Finley Peter Dunne|Mr. Dooley]] said, to the election returns.\" Indeed, the Supreme Court has developed a system of doctrine and practice that self-limits its power of judicial review.<!-- ref name=autogenerated11 -->{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=145}}\n\nThe Court controls almost all of its business by choosing what cases to consider, writs of [[certiorari]]. In this way, it can avoid opinions on embarrassing or difficult cases. The Supreme Court limits itself by defining for itself what is a \"justiciable question.\" First, the Court is fairly consistent in refusing to make any \"[[advisory opinion]]s\" in advance of actual cases.{{refn|group= lower-alpha |\"Advisory opinions\" are not the same as \"[[declaratory judgment]]s.\" (a) These address rights and legal relationships in cases of \"actual controversy\", and (b) the holding has the force and effect of a final judgment. (c) There is no coercive order, as the parties are assumed to follow the judgment, but a \"declaratory judgment\" is the basis of any subsequent ruling in case law.}} Second, \"[[friendly suit]]s\" between those of the same legal interest are not considered. Third, the Court requires a \"personal interest\", not one generally held, and a legally protected right must be immediately threatened by government action. Cases are not taken up if the litigant has no [[Standing (law)|standing to sue]]. Simply having the money to sue and being injured by government action are not enough.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=145}}\n\nThese three procedural ways of dismissing cases have led critics to charge that the Supreme Court delays decisions by unduly insisting on technicalities in their \"standards of litigability\".  They say cases are left unconsidered which are in the public interest, with genuine controversy, and resulting from good faith action.  \"The Supreme Court is not only a court of law but a court of justice.\"{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\n====Separation of powers====\nThe Supreme Court balances several pressures to maintain its roles in national government. It seeks to be a co-equal branch of government, but its decrees must be enforceable. The Court seeks to minimize situations where it asserts itself superior to either President or Congress, but federal officers must be held accountable. The Supreme Court assumes power to declare acts of Congress as unconstitutional but it self-limits its passing on constitutional questions.<!-- ref name=autogenerated5 -->{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=149}} But the Court's guidance on basic problems of life and governance in a democracy is most effective when American political life reinforce its rulings.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=154}}\n\n[[Louis Brandeis|Justice Brandeis]] summarized four general guidelines that the Supreme Court uses to avoid constitutional decisions relating to Congress:{{refn|group= lower-alpha |Louis Brandeis concurring opinion, ''Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority'', 1936.}} The Court will not anticipate a question of constitutional law nor decide open questions unless a case decision requires it. If it does, a rule of constitutional law is formulated only as the precise facts in the case require. The Court will choose statutes or general law for the basis of its decision if it can without constitutional grounds. If it does, the Court will choose a constitutional construction of an Act of Congress, even if its constitutionality is seriously in doubt. {{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=149}}\n\nLikewise with the Executive Department, Edwin Corwin observed that the Court does sometimes rebuff presidential pretensions, but it more often tries to rationalize them. Against Congress, an Act is merely \"disallowed\". In the executive case, exercising judicial review produces \"some change in the external world\" beyond the ordinary judicial sphere.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=150}} The \"political question\" doctrine especially applies to questions which present a difficult enforcement issue. Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] addressed the Court's limitation when political process allowed future policy change, but a judicial ruling would \"attribute finality\". Political questions lack \"satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination\".{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=151}}\n\nJohn Marshall recognized that the president holds \"important political powers\" which as [[Executive privilege]] allows great discretion. This doctrine was applied in Court rulings on President [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]]'s duty to enforce the law during [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]. It extends to the sphere of foreign affairs. Justice [[Robert H. Jackson|Robert Jackson]] explained, Foreign affairs are inherently political, \"wholly confided by our Constitution to the political departments of the government&nbsp;... [and] not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.\"{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nCritics of the Court object in two principal ways to self-restraint in judicial review, deferring as it does as a matter of doctrine to Acts of Congress and Presidential actions.\n# Its inaction is said to allow \"a flood of legislative appropriations\" which permanently create an imbalance between the states and federal government.\n# Supreme Court deference to Congress and the executive compromises American protection of civil rights, political minority groups and aliens.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=153}}\n{{Further|Separation of powers under the United States Constitution}}\n\n===Subsequent Courts===\n{{main |History of the Supreme Court of the United States }}\n\nSupreme Courts under the leadership of subsequent Chief Justices have also used judicial review to interpret the Constitution among individuals, states and federal branches. Notable contributions were made by the Chase Court, the Taft Court, the Warren Court, and the Rehnquist Court.\n\n{{further|List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Chase Court}}\n[[Salmon P. Chase]] was a Lincoln appointee, serving as Chief Justice from 1864 to 1873. His career encompassed service as a U.S. senator and Governor of Ohio. He coined the slogan, \"Free soil, free Labor, free men.\" One of Lincoln's \"team of rivals\", he was appointed Secretary of Treasury during the Civil War, issuing \"greenbacks\". To appease radical Republicans, Lincoln appointed him to replace Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] of [[Dred Scott]] case fame.\n\nIn one of his first official acts, Chase admitted [[John Rock (abolitionist)|John Rock]], the first African-American to practice before the Supreme Court. The \"Chase Court\" is famous for ''[[Texas v. White]]'', which asserted a permanent Union of indestructible states. ''[[Veazie Bank v. Fenno]]'' upheld the Civil War tax on state banknotes. ''[[Hepburn v.

A [[Factions in the Republican Party (United States)#Progressive Republicans|Progressive Republican]] from Ohio, he was a one-term President.\n\nAs Chief Justice, he advocated the [[Judiciary Act of 1925]] that brought the Federal District Courts under the administrative jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Taft successfully sought the expansion of Court jurisdiction over non- states such as District of Columbia and Territories of Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nIn 1925, the Taft Court issued a ruling overturning a Marshall Court ruling on the Bill of Rights. In ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', the Court established the doctrine of \"[[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation]] which applied the Bill of Rights to the states. Important cases included the ''[[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen]]'' that upheld Congressional regulation of commerce. ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' allowed exclusion of evidence obtained without a warrant based on application of the 14th Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches. ''[[Wisconsin v. Illinois]]'' ruled the equitable power of the United States can impose positive action on a state to prevent its inaction from damaging another state.\n\n{{further|List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Warren Court}}\n[[Earl Warren]] was an Eisenhower nominee, Chief Justice from 1953 to 1969. Warren's Republican career in the law reached from County Prosecutor, California state attorney general, and three consecutive terms as Governor. His programs stressed progressive efficiency, expanding state education, re-integrating returning veterans, infrastructure and highway construction.\n\nIn 1954, the Warren Court overturned a landmark [[Melville Fuller#Chief Justice|Fuller Court]] ruling on the Fourteenth Amendment interpreting racial segregation as permissible in government and commerce providing \"separate but equal\" services. Warren built a coalition of Justices after 1962 that developed the idea of natural rights as guaranteed in the Constitution. ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' banned segregation in public schools. ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' and ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' established Court ordered \"one-man-one-vote\". Bill of Rights Amendments were incorporated into the states. Due process was expanded in ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' and ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]].'' First Amendment rights were addressed in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' concerning privacy, and ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' relative to free speech.\n\n{{further|List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court}}\n[[William Rehnquist]] was a Reagan appointment to Chief Justice, serving from 1986 to 2005. While he would concur with overthrowing a state supreme court's decision, as in ''Bush v. Gore'', he built a coalition of Justices after 1994 that developed the idea of federalism as provided for in the Tenth Amendment. In the hands of the Supreme Court, the Constitution and its Amendments were to restrain Congress, as in ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]''.\n\nNevertheless, the Rehnquist Court was noted in the contemporary \"culture wars\" for overturning state laws relating to privacy prohibiting late-term abortions in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', prohibiting sodomy in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', or ruling so as to protect free speech in ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'' or affirmative action in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]''.\n\n==Civic religion==\n{{Main|American civil religion}}\n\nThere is a viewpoint that some Americans have come to see the documents of the Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], as being a cornerstone of a type of [[civil religion]]. This is suggested by the prominent display of the Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, in massive, bronze-framed, bulletproof, moisture-controlled glass containers vacuum-sealed in a rotunda by day and in multi-ton bomb-proof vaults by night at the [[National Archives Building]].<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite news |last= Wood |first= Gordon S. |url= http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/aug/14/dusting-off-the-declaration/ |title= Dusting off the Declaration |work= The New York Review of Books |date= August 14, 1997 |accessdate= December 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of displaying the documents struck one academic critic looking from the point of view of the 1776 or 1789 America as \"idolatrous, and also curiously at odds with the values of the Revolution\".<ref name=\"Wood\"/> By 1816, Jefferson wrote that \"[s]ome men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the [[Ark of the Covenant]], too sacred to be touched\". But he saw imperfections and imagined that there could potentially be others, believing as he did that \"institutions must advance also\".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=115}}\n\nSome commentators depict the multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian United States as held together by a political orthodoxy, in contrast with a [[nation state]] of people having more \"natural\" ties.{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=118}}{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=119}}\n\n==Worldwide influence==\n{{Main|United States Constitution and worldwide influence}}\n{|align=right\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Jose rizal 01.jpg|'''[[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'''\nFile:Sun Yat-sen 2.jpg|'''[[Sun Yat-sen]]'''\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe United States Constitution has been a notable model for governance around the world.

The Rebels played their home games at the newly renovated [[Vaught\u2013Hemingway Stadium]] in [[Oxford, Mississippi]] and competed in the Western Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). They were led by fifth-year head coach [[Hugh Freeze]] in what would turn out to be his final season with the Rebels.<ref>https://www.si.com/college-football/2017/07/20/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-resigns-matt-luke-interim-head-coach</ref> They finished the season 0\u20137, 0\u20136 in SEC play to finish in last place in the Western Division. \n\nOn February 11, 2019, Ole Miss announced the vacation of all wins in the years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2016.

Ole Miss then rose to no.3 in the AP Poll, and although they were heavy favorites in their next matchup against [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]], they struggled mightily, but ultimately emerged victorious. They Rebels maintained their no.3 ranking before getting blown out by [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] on the road and fell to no.14 before bouncing back against [[New Mexico State Aggies football|New Mexico State]]. The Rebels entered their next game with a #13 ranking against rival [[Memphis Tigers football|Memphis]], in what was one of the most anticipated in the history of Memphis football. Ole Miss, despite being double digit favorites, lost by 13 points, causing them to fall 11 spots in the rankings to no.24. The Rebels followed with two wins against SEC West opponents [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] and [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] and climbed to no.18 in the rankings and controlled their own destiny the SEC West, but a heartbreaking loss to [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] the following week caused them to fall to second place in the SEC West and to fall out of the rankings for the first time since the [[2013 Ole Miss Rebels football team|2013 season]]. However, Ole Miss finished the regular season with double digit wins over ranked SEC Rivals [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] and [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]] and rose to no.12 in the [[College Football Playoff]] poll, which earned them a [[2016 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] berth for the first time since 1970, where they defeated no.16 [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]] and ultimately finished ranked no.10 in the AP Poll, their first top-ten finish since 1969.\n\n===NCAA investigation===\nThe offseason was a controversial one for the Rebels, where an ongoing NCAA investigation dominated college football headlines. The investigation began prior to the start of the 2015 season, where Ole Miss star offensive tackle [[Laremy Tunsil]] was arrested on charges of [[domestic violence]] after allegedly assaulting his stepfather, Lindsey Miller. Ole Miss coach [[Hugh Freeze]] announced that Tunsil was defending his mother, Desiree Tunsil. A police report that was released days after the incident stated that Miller claimed Tunsil was \"riding around with football agents\" and that when a deputy arrived at the scene of the incident, \"Tunsil and the agents\" left in a yellow convertible. Days later, NCAA officials interviewed Miller about allegations of multiple violations of rules by the Ole Miss football program; Hugh Freeze later dismissed the possibility of a violation of rules, saying he's confident his program \"always does the right thing\". In August 2015, Tunsil and Miller agreed to drop charges against each other and sign dismissal forms. However, Tunsil was suspended from the first seven games of the 2015 season, making his debut against Texas A&M. In October 2015, Ole Miss announced that Tunsil used three loaner vehicles over a six-month period without payment, among other impermissible benefits.\n\nOnly a few days later, an NCAA investigation of Louisiana Lafayette revealed that former Ole Miss coach David Saunders may have potentially committed violations while at Ole Miss. Saunders allegedly helped five recruits receive fraudulent ACT scores at Wayne County High School, lied to the NCAA about his involvement and failed to cooperate with the subsequent investigation. He also allegedly gave a total of $6,500 to a player over the course of two semesters while at Louisiana Lafayette.\n\nIn January 2016, after the Rebels' Sugar Bowl victory over Oklahoma State, Ole Miss received a notice of allegations from the NCAA. However, Ole Miss athletic director [[Ross Bjork]] stated that the majority of the violations occurred before his arrival at Ole Miss and before the hiring of Hugh Freeze. In February, Bjork said that the NCAA has completed its investigation of Ole Miss's football program, and also stated that he did not expect a \"second letter\" from the NCAA concerning additional violations and that Freeze was not named by the NCAA in any wrongdoing.\n\nAt this point, the investigation was seemingly coming to an end, but on the night of the [[NFL Draft]], Laremy Tunsil's [[Instagram]] account was hacked, and a video of him smoking a bong fashioned out of a gas mask is posted, as well as photos of text messages where Tunsil asks for money from an Ole Miss administrator. When asked if he ever received money while at Ole Miss, Tunsil admitted that he did, in fact, receive money.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, Ole Miss self-imposed an 11-scholarship reduction over the course of four seasons. Along with the reduction of scholarships, the school has also suspended two unnamed assistants from recruiting, fined itself $159,352 and required current staff to go through additional training on NCAA rules and policy. In August 2016, it was announced that NCAA investigators have interviewed players at rival SEC schools about their recruitment by Ole Miss. NCAA Enforcement representatives have visited Auburn and Mississippi State, along with perhaps one other unnamed SEC West school during the summer of 2016. The players were granted immunity from possible NCAA sanctions in exchange for truthful accounts of their recruitment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/sports/news/sources-ncaas-ole-miss-investigation-expands-beyond-laremy-tunsil-124229650.html?client=safari|title=Sources: NCAA's Ole Miss Investigation expands beyone Laremy Tunsil|last=Forde|first=Pat|work=[[Yahoo!

Freshman quarterback [[Deondre Francois]] led the Seminoles to the red zone on the first possession of his college career, but the Seminoles settled for a 25-yd field goal as time expired in the first quarter. The Ole Miss offense started off strong in the second quarter as well, when Kelly found freshman receiver [[D. K. Metcalf]] for his second touchdown pass of the game from three yards out with 12:42 remaining in the half to take a 14\u20133 lead. After a stop by the Rebel defense, Ole Miss got the ball back and extended their lead to 21\u20133 when Kelly found star tight end Evan Engram from 21 yards out with 9:42 remaining in the half. On the ensuing FSU drive, the Seminoles converted multiple first downs and reached the red zone for only the second time of the night. Francois found star running back [[Dalvin Cook]] open for what seemed to be a sure touchdown, but Cook dropped the ball out of bounds short of the goal line, causing the Seminoles to settle for a field goal from 21 yards out, cutting the lead to 21\u20136. Ole Miss wasted little time scoring another touchdown, when running back [[Akeem Judd]] found the end zone from 11 yards out to increase the Rebel lead to 28\u20136 with a little more than three minutes remaining in the first half. On the ensuing drive, Francois gave the Seminoles momentum when he found Travis Rudolph from 16 yards out as time expired at the half, giving the Rebels a 28\u201313 lead going into the locker room. Following halftime adjustments, Florida State dominated the third quarter, beginning with a Ricky Aguayo field goal from 40 yards out. Following an interception thrown by Kelly, the Seminoles scored their first touchdown of the half with a Freddie Stevenson run from one yard out to cut the deficit to 28\u201323. On the ensuing Rebel possession, Kelly fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Florida State, and they scored another touchdown on the ensuing drive. Following a failed two point conversion attempt, the Seminoles had a 29\u201328 lead with 9:17 left in the third quarter. Following another fumble recovery by the Seminoles, FSU had another opportunity to score again, which they did with a Deondre Francois pass to [[Ryan Izzo]] from two yards out, giving the Seminoles a 36\u201328 lead with 4:12 left in the third quarter. After the following Ole Miss drive stalled, Florida State got the ball to begin the fourth quarter. The Seminoles were forced to settle for a field goal, which Aguayo made from 40 yards out, giving FSU a 39\u201328 lead. Ole Miss finally found some momentum on offense when Kelly led the Rebels to their first touchdown since the first half, when he found Van Jefferson from 20 yards out. Following a failed two point conversion, Florida State's lead remained 39\u201334. Ole Miss got the ball back following two FSU field goals from Aguayo from 44 and 30 yards out, respectively. With an 11-point deficit and the game on the line, Kelly and the Rebel had one final opportunity to possibly win the game, but the game was sealed by an interception thrown by Kelly with roughly two and a half minutes left in the game, in what was the biggest comeback win in FSU football history.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Wofford===\n{{see also|2016 Wofford Terriers football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = Wofford @ Ole Miss \n| Visitor = Terriers\n| Host = '''#19 Rebels'''\n|V1=0|V2=3|V3=0|V4=10\n|H1=10|H2=14|H3=7|H4=7\n| Date = September 10th\n| Location =  [[Oxford, Mississippi]]\n| TimeZone=CST\n| StartTime = 3:00 p.m.\n| ElapsedTime =\n| Attendance = 64,232\n| Weather =\n| Referee =\n|TVAnnouncers=<br>[[Tom Hart (sports announcer)|Tom Hart]] (play-by-play)<br>[[Andre Ware]] (color)<br>[[Cole Cubelic]] (sideline)\n|TVStation=SECN\n}}\n*'''Favorite: Ole Miss by 43'''\n{{AFB game box end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Gary Wunderlich field goal and a touchdown pass from Chad Kelly to Markell Pack. Wofford, despite running the ball relatively well in the opening quarter, failed to score any points. Ole Miss's momentum continued in the second quarter when Kelly found freshman receiver D.K. Metcalf from ten yards out only one minute and ten seconds into the second quarter. On the ensuing drive, the Terriers finally found some offensive momentum, and drove deep into Ole Miss territory but ultimately settled for a 29-yd. David Marvin field goal with four and a half minutes remaining in the half, cutting Ole Miss's lead to two touchdowns. The final score of the first half came when Kelly found receiver [[Quincy Adeboyejo]] from six yards out to put the Rebels up 24\u20133 at the half. After an extended halftime due to a brief weather delay, the third quarter began with Wofford receiving the ball and despite driving deep into Ole Miss territory, the Terriers came up scoreless after failing to convert a 4th and 2 from the Ole Miss 23 yard line. After a lengthy Ole Miss drive, the Rebels found the end zone again when quarterback Jason Pellerin ran it in from six yards out to increase Ole Miss's lead to 31\u20133 with 5:07 remaining in the third quarter. After a combined four punts by both teams, Wofford would find the end zone for the first time of the game when quarterback Brad Butler ran it in from 17 yards out, pulling to within three touchdowns with 10 and a half minutes left in the game. After another lengthy drive, Ole Miss would find the end zone for the last touchdown of the game when Pellerin found freshman receiver A.J. Brown from twelve yards out to extend the Rebels' lead to four touchdowns.

On the ensuing drive, Chad Kelly found the end zone from 5 yards out, his second rushing touchdown of the game to pull the Rebels to within four once again. The Ole Miss defense forced a punt on the Eagles' following possession, giving Ole Miss an opportunity to retake the lead, which they did when running back Akeem Judd ran it in from 9 yards out with 3:36 remaining in the half. Ole Miss got the ball back again when the defense forced a second consecutive punt, and further extended their lead when Kelly found tight end [[Evan Engram]] from 38 yards out with just over two minutes remaining in the half, which would be the final score before halftime. Each team opened the second half with a punt, and it was the Eagles who struck first in the second half when kicker [[Younghoe Koo]] made a 41-yard field goal with about 3 minutes left in the quarter. After Ole Miss's offense stalled in the red zone on the following possession, kicker Gary Wunderlich responded with a field goal of his own from 29 yards out, with only 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter. Despite a relatively productive offensive performance on the following drive, the Eagles settled for yet another field goal with 12:09 left in the game, from 38 yards out, reducing the deficit to a touchdown. Ole Miss extended the lead to 10 once again with 7:14 left in the game, which would be the game's final points scored. Ole Miss snapped its three games losing streak with a double digit win in their first ever meeting with Georgia Southern.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===#10 Texas A&M===\n{{see also|2016 Texas A&M Aggies football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = Ole Miss @ Texas A&M\n| Visitor = '''Rebels'''\n| Host = #10 Aggies\n|V1=3|V2=3|V3=0|V4=23\n|H1=7|H2=14|H3=0|H4=7\n| Date = November 12th\n| Location =  [[College Station, Texas]]\n| TimeZone=CST\n| StartTime = \n| ElapsedTime =\n| Attendance = 104,892\n| Weather =\n| Referee =\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n*'''Favorite: Texas A&M by 7'''\n{{AFB game box end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Each team's first drive stalled, with Ole Miss being forced to punt after a three-and-out on the game's opening drive and with Texas A&M being stopped on the 4th down and 4 at the Ole Miss 34 yard line. Ole Miss struck first on the ensuing drive with a 25-yard Gary Wunderlich field goal, giving the Rebels a 3\u20130 lead with 5:23 left in the first quarter. On the Aggies' drive that followed, Texas A&M quarterback Jake Hubenak found a wide open [[Christian Kirk]] for a gain of 69 yards, which eventually led to the game's first touchdown when Texas A&M running back Keith Ford ran it in from six yards out, giving the Aggies a 7\u20133 lead with 4:49 left in opening quarter. The Aggies got the ball back again after the ensuing Ole Miss possession stalled and resulted in a punt, and scored once again when Keith Ford found the end zone a yard out, shortly after the second quarter began. Ole Miss's next drive stalled in the red zone for the second time of the night, and the Rebels settled for a 24-yard Gary Wunderlich field goal, cutting the deficit to 14\u20136 with 7:46 left in the first half. The Aggies extended their lead to 15 on the following drive, which was set up a 90-yard kickoff return to the Ole Miss 6 yard line and capped off with a 1-yard pass from Hubenak to Speedy Noil with 6:43 left in the second quarter, which would be the final score of the half. The Aggies got the ball with great field position to open the second half after an unsuccessful onside kick attempt by the Rebels, with the ball on the Aggies' 48 yard line. The Aggies failed to take advantage of the good field position, when the Ole Miss defense stopped the Texas A&M offense on 4th and 1. The Aggies got the ball back following a Shea Patterson interception on the next drive, but couldn't get any offensive production going, as they were forced to punt the ball back to the Rebels, but got the ball back once again following a fumble by Jason Pellerin the red zone. The remainder of the third quarter featured three punts, which preserved a 21\u20136 score heading into the game's final quarter. Ole Miss quickly opened scoring in the fourth quarter, however, when Patterson found receiver Damore'ea Stringfellow for a 6-yard touchdown strike with 14:50 left in the game. Ole Miss got the ball after the Aggies' drive that followed stalled, and converted the opportunity to points when running back Akeem Judd found the end zone from 21 yards out with 12:12 left in the game. The Rebels reduced the deficit to 21\u201319 after an unsuccessful two point conversion attempt. The Aggies responded with a score of their own when Hubenak found receiver Josh Reynolds from 13 yards out with 6:41 left in the game, extending the Aggie lead to 9. Ole Miss responded on the following drive with a 32-yard Van Jefferson touchdown reception with 5:17 left. The Aggies were forced to punt on the following possession, giving Ole Miss the ball with an opportunity to take the lead with, which they did so with a 39-yard Gary Wunderlich field goal with just 37 seconds left in the game, giving the Rebels a 1-point lead. On the Texas A&M possession that followed, Jake Hubenak was intercepted by Deontay Anderson, sealing the upset victory for the Rebels, their first win of the season against an SEC West opponent and their third consecutive win over the Aggies.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Vanderbilt===\n{{see also|2016 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = Ole Miss @ Vanderbilt <br> ([[Vanderbilt\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry]])\n| Visitor = Rebels\n| Host = '''Commodores'''\n|V1=10|V2=0|V3=0|V4=7\n|H1=7|H2=7|H3=17|H4=7\n| Date = November 19th\n| Location =  [[Nashville, Tennessee]]\n| TimeZone=EST\n| StartTime = \n| ElapsedTime =\n| Attendance = 27,763\n| Weather =\n| Referee =\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n*'''Favorite: Ole Miss by 9.5'''\n*'''Sources:'''\n{{AFB game box end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Rebels played their home games at the newly renovated [[Vaught\u2013Hemingway Stadium]] in [[Oxford, Mississippi]] and competed in the Western Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). They were led by fifth-year head coach [[Hugh Freeze]] in what would turn out to be his final season with the Rebels.<ref>https://www.si.com/college-football/2017/07/20/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-resigns-matt-luke-interim-head-coach</ref> They finished the season 0\u20137, 0\u20136 in SEC play to finish in last place in the Western Division. \n\nOn February 11, 2019, Ole Miss announced the vacation of all wins in the years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2016.

Ole Miss then rose to no.3 in the AP Poll, and although they were heavy favorites in their next matchup against [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]], they struggled mightily, but ultimately emerged victorious. They Rebels maintained their no.3 ranking before getting blown out by [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] on the road and fell to no.14 before bouncing back against [[New Mexico State Aggies football|New Mexico State]]. The Rebels entered their next game with a #13 ranking against rival [[Memphis Tigers football|Memphis]], in what was one of the most anticipated in the history of Memphis football. Ole Miss, despite being double digit favorites, lost by 13 points, causing them to fall 11 spots in the rankings to no.24. The Rebels followed with two wins against SEC West opponents [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] and [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] and climbed to no.18 in the rankings and controlled their own destiny the SEC West, but a heartbreaking loss to [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] the following week caused them to fall to second place in the SEC West and to fall out of the rankings for the first time since the [[2013 Ole Miss Rebels football team|2013 season]]. However, Ole Miss finished the regular season with double digit wins over ranked SEC Rivals [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] and [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]] and rose to no.12 in the [[College Football Playoff]] poll, which earned them a [[2016 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] berth for the first time since 1970, where they defeated no.16 [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]] and ultimately finished ranked no.10 in the AP Poll, their first top-ten finish since 1969.\n\n===NCAA investigation===\nThe offseason was a controversial one for the Rebels, where an ongoing NCAA investigation dominated college football headlines. The investigation began prior to the start of the 2015 season, where Ole Miss star offensive tackle [[Laremy Tunsil]] was arrested on charges of [[domestic violence]] after allegedly assaulting his stepfather, Lindsey Miller. Ole Miss coach [[Hugh Freeze]] announced that Tunsil was defending his mother, Desiree Tunsil. A police report that was released days after the incident stated that Miller claimed Tunsil was \"riding around with football agents\" and that when a deputy arrived at the scene of the incident, \"Tunsil and the agents\" left in a yellow convertible. Days later, NCAA officials interviewed Miller about allegations of multiple violations of rules by the Ole Miss football program; Hugh Freeze later dismissed the possibility of a violation of rules, saying he's confident his program \"always does the right thing\". In August 2015, Tunsil and Miller agreed to drop charges against each other and sign dismissal forms. However, Tunsil was suspended from the first seven games of the 2015 season, making his debut against Texas A&M. In October 2015, Ole Miss announced that Tunsil used three loaner vehicles over a six-month period without payment, among other impermissible benefits.\n\nOnly a few days later, an NCAA investigation of Louisiana Lafayette revealed that former Ole Miss coach David Saunders may have potentially committed violations while at Ole Miss. Saunders allegedly helped five recruits receive fraudulent ACT scores at Wayne County High School, lied to the NCAA about his involvement and failed to cooperate with the subsequent investigation. He also allegedly gave a total of $6,500 to a player over the course of two semesters while at Louisiana Lafayette.\n\nIn January 2016, after the Rebels' Sugar Bowl victory over Oklahoma State, Ole Miss received a notice of allegations from the NCAA. However, Ole Miss athletic director [[Ross Bjork]] stated that the majority of the violations occurred before his arrival at Ole Miss and before the hiring of Hugh Freeze. In February, Bjork said that the NCAA has completed its investigation of Ole Miss's football program, and also stated that he did not expect a \"second letter\" from the NCAA concerning additional violations and that Freeze was not named by the NCAA in any wrongdoing.\n\nAt this point, the investigation was seemingly coming to an end, but on the night of the [[NFL Draft]], Laremy Tunsil's [[Instagram]] account was hacked, and a video of him smoking a bong fashioned out of a gas mask is posted, as well as photos of text messages where Tunsil asks for money from an Ole Miss administrator. When asked if he ever received money while at Ole Miss, Tunsil admitted that he did, in fact, receive money.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, Ole Miss self-imposed an 11-scholarship reduction over the course of four seasons. Along with the reduction of scholarships, the school has also suspended two unnamed assistants from recruiting, fined itself $159,352 and required current staff to go through additional training on NCAA rules and policy. In August 2016, it was announced that NCAA investigators have interviewed players at rival SEC schools about their recruitment by Ole Miss. NCAA Enforcement representatives have visited Auburn and Mississippi State, along with perhaps one other unnamed SEC West school during the summer of 2016. The players were granted immunity from possible NCAA sanctions in exchange for truthful accounts of their recruitment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/sports/news/sources-ncaas-ole-miss-investigation-expands-beyond-laremy-tunsil-124229650.html?client=safari|title=Sources: NCAA's Ole Miss Investigation expands beyone Laremy Tunsil|last=Forde|first=Pat|work=[[Yahoo!

The rebels' quarterback [[Chad Kelly]] drove the explosive Rebel offense to an early score on the first drive of the game, where Kelly found receiver Damorea'ea Stringfellow in the end zone from 3 yards out, taking only one minute and forty-six seconds off the clock. Freshman quarterback [[Deondre Francois]] led the Seminoles to the red zone on the first possession of his college career, but the Seminoles settled for a 25-yd field goal as time expired in the first quarter. The Ole Miss offense started off strong in the second quarter as well, when Kelly found freshman receiver [[D. K. Metcalf]] for his second touchdown pass of the game from three yards out with 12:42 remaining in the half to take a 14\u20133 lead. After a stop by the Rebel defense, Ole Miss got the ball back and extended their lead to 21\u20133 when Kelly found star tight end Evan Engram from 21 yards out with 9:42 remaining in the half. On the ensuing FSU drive, the Seminoles converted multiple first downs and reached the red zone for only the second time of the night. Francois found star running back [[Dalvin Cook]] open for what seemed to be a sure touchdown, but Cook dropped the ball out of bounds short of the goal line, causing the Seminoles to settle for a field goal from 21 yards out, cutting the lead to 21\u20136. Ole Miss wasted little time scoring another touchdown, when running back [[Akeem Judd]] found the end zone from 11 yards out to increase the Rebel lead to 28\u20136 with a little more than three minutes remaining in the first half. On the ensuing drive, Francois gave the Seminoles momentum when he found Travis Rudolph from 16 yards out as time expired at the half, giving the Rebels a 28\u201313 lead going into the locker room. Following halftime adjustments, Florida State dominated the third quarter, beginning with a Ricky Aguayo field goal from 40 yards out. Following an interception thrown by Kelly, the Seminoles scored their first touchdown of the half with a Freddie Stevenson run from one yard out to cut the deficit to 28\u201323. On the ensuing Rebel possession, Kelly fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Florida State, and they scored another touchdown on the ensuing drive. Following a failed two point conversion attempt, the Seminoles had a 29\u201328 lead with 9:17 left in the third quarter. Following another fumble recovery by the Seminoles, FSU had another opportunity to score again, which they did with a Deondre Francois pass to [[Ryan Izzo]] from two yards out, giving the Seminoles a 36\u201328 lead with 4:12 left in the third quarter. After the following Ole Miss drive stalled, Florida State got the ball to begin the fourth quarter. The Seminoles were forced to settle for a field goal, which Aguayo made from 40 yards out, giving FSU a 39\u201328 lead. Ole Miss finally found some momentum on offense when Kelly led the Rebels to their first touchdown since the first half, when he found Van Jefferson from 20 yards out. Following a failed two point conversion, Florida State's lead remained 39\u201334. Ole Miss got the ball back following two FSU field goals from Aguayo from 44 and 30 yards out, respectively. With an 11-point deficit and the game on the line, Kelly and the Rebel had one final opportunity to possibly win the game, but the game was sealed by an interception thrown by Kelly with roughly two and a half minutes left in the game, in what was the biggest comeback win in FSU football history.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Wofford===\n{{see also|2016 Wofford Terriers football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = Wofford @ Ole Miss \n| Visitor = Terriers\n| Host = '''#19 Rebels'''\n|V1=0|V2=3|V3=0|V4=10\n|H1=10|H2=14|H3=7|H4=7\n| Date = September 10th\n| Location =  [[Oxford, Mississippi]]\n| TimeZone=CST\n| StartTime = 3:00 p.m.\n| ElapsedTime =\n| Attendance = 64,232\n| Weather =\n| Referee =\n|TVAnnouncers=<br>[[Tom Hart (sports announcer)|Tom Hart]] (play-by-play)<br>[[Andre Ware]] (color)<br>[[Cole Cubelic]] (sideline)\n|TVStation=SECN\n}}\n*'''Favorite: Ole Miss by 43\n{{AFB game box end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Rebels, looking to bounce back from a crushing defeat to Florida State a week ago, began with a fast start against the Terriers, going up 10\u20130 roughly halfway through the first quarter thanks a 40-yd. Gary Wunderlich field goal and a touchdown pass from Chad Kelly to Markell Pack. Wofford, despite running the ball relatively well in the opening quarter, failed to score any points. Ole Miss's momentum continued in the second quarter when Kelly found freshman receiver D.K. Metcalf from ten yards out only one minute and ten seconds into the second quarter. On the ensuing drive, the Terriers finally found some offensive momentum, and drove deep into Ole Miss territory but ultimately settled for a 29-yd. David Marvin field goal with four and a half minutes remaining in the half, cutting Ole Miss's lead to two touchdowns. The final score of the first half came when Kelly found receiver [[Quincy Adeboyejo]] from six yards out to put the Rebels up 24\u20133 at the half. After an extended halftime due to a brief weather delay, the third quarter began with Wofford receiving the ball and despite driving deep into Ole Miss territory, the Terriers came up scoreless after failing to convert a 4th and 2 from the Ole Miss 23 yard line. After a lengthy Ole Miss drive, the Rebels found the end zone again when quarterback Jason Pellerin ran it in from six yards out to increase Ole Miss's lead to 31\u20133 with 5:07 remaining in the third quarter. After a combined four punts by both teams, Wofford would find the end zone for the first time of the game when quarterback Brad Butler ran it in from 17 yards out, pulling to within three touchdowns with 10 and a half minutes left in the game. After another lengthy drive, Ole Miss would find the end zone for the last touchdown of the game when Pellerin found freshman receiver A.J. Brown from twelve yards out to extend the Rebels' lead to four touchdowns. Wafered would manage to put a field goal on the board from 50 yards out with 2:28 left, but Ole Miss went on to win 38\u201313.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===#1 Alabama===\n{{see also|2016 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = Alabama @ Ole Miss <br> ([[Alabama\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry]])\n| Visitor = '''#1 Crimson Tide'''\n| Host = #19 Rebels\n|V1=3|V2=14|V3=17|V4=14\n|H1=7|H2=17|H3=3|H4=16\n| Date = September 17th\n| Location =  [[Oxford, Mississippi]]\n| TimeZone=CST\n| StartTime = 2:30 pm\n| ElapsedTime =\n| Attendance = 66,176\n| Weather =\n| Referee =\n|TVAnnouncers= <br/> [[Verne Lundquist]] (play-by-play) <br/> [[Gary Danielson]] (color) <br/> [[Allie LaForce]] (sideline)\n|TVStation= [[SEC on CBS|CBS]]\n}}\n*'''Favorite: Alabama by 10\n{{AFB game box end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Ole Miss offense got off to a fast start, with running back Akeem Judd running it in from 23 yards out, taking only 1:53 off the clock. Alabama would get on the board with just under 6 minutes left in the first quarter, when kicker Adam Griffith made a 32-yard field goal. The next three scores would all belong to Ole Miss, starting with a Gary Wunderlich field goal from 23 yards out. Roughly three minutes later, Ole Miss quarterback [[Chad Kelly]] found Evan Engram from 63 yards out to put the Rebels up 17\u20133 with 4:40 left in the half. The Rebels would get their first defensive score of the season when Alabama quarterback [[Jalen Hurts]] was sacked, and subsequently fumbled the ball. Ole Miss defensive end John Youngblood recovered and returned it 44 yards for Ole Miss's next touchdown, putting Ole Miss up 24\u20133. On the ensuing drive, Alabama had its most productive drive of the game to that point, getting in the red zone for only the second time and finding the end zone when [[Calvin Ridley]] found the end zone from six yards out with just over two minutes remaining in the half. After the ensuing Ole Miss drive stalled, the Rebels punted the ball and Alabama return man Eddie Jackson returned the punt 85 yards for another Alabama touchdown, in what would be the final score of the half.

Herrien would score the only touchdown of the fourth quarter with five minutes left, when he ran it in from one yard out, but it was too little too late, as Ole Miss went on to win 45\u201314, their largest margin of victory ever against Georgia and their first win against the Bulldogs since 1996.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Memphis===\n{{see also|2016 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = Memphis @ Ole Miss <br> ([[Memphis\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry]])\n| Visitor = Tigers\n| Host = '''#16 Rebels'''\n|V1=0|V2=7|V3=14|V4=7\n|H1=14|H2=10|H3=10|H4=14\n| Date = October 1st\n| Location =  [[Oxford, Mississippi]]\n| TimeZone=CST\n| StartTime = 6:00 p.m.\n| ElapsedTime =\n| Attendance = 65,889\n| Weather =\n| Referee =\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|TVStation=\n}}\n*'''Favorite: Ole Miss by 15.5\n{{AFB game box end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other. By this time, Wajoq had also fallen under Gowa's sphere of influence, and supported Gowa in a war against Bon\u00e9 in the 1560s.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=116, 131\u2013132}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=30}}\n\n=== The ''Tellumpocco'' alliance and the rise of Gowa-Talloq (1582\u20131660) ===\n[[File:South Sulawesi circa 1600.svg|thumb|upright=1|Political division of southern Sulawesi in around 1590]]\n\nThe continued rise of Gowa and its harsh treatment of its Bugis subordinates Wajoq and [[Soppeng|Sopp\u00e9ng]] prompted the latter two to sign the Treaty of Timurung, a mutual defense pact initiated by Bon\u00e9 in 1582.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=132\u2013133}} The relationship between these three allied Bugis polities, also known as the ''[[Tellumpocco]]'' (\"Three Powers\", lit. \"Three Peaks\"), is defined as that of brothers, with Bon\u00e9 acting as the elder, Wajoq the middle, and Sopp\u00e9ng the younger one.

One such conference in the early 18th century saw the codification of laws regulating Wajorese commerce and navigation, popularly called the Ammana Gappa's law code, after the then leader of the Wajorese community in Makassar. These laws set up frameworks for managing credit and debts as well as regulating other kinds of business relationships, providing ways to resolve conflict and giving Wajorese merchants advantages over merchants from other groups in Maritime Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=84, 91, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=64\u201365, 71}} Such a law code, according to historian Kathryn Wellen, is \"highly unusual, if not unique, for early modern insular Southeast Asia\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=84}}\n\nThe government financially supported Wajorese merchants by providing monetary loans, taken from the fund established by La Sal\u00e9wangeng. Borrowers were obliged to return the principals alongside parts of their profits. The profits would then be used to further Wajoq's interest, such as building armaments or renovating the state's mosque. This system allowed a large segment of Wajorese population to participate in commerce while also utilizing their economic power for the benefit of the society as a whole.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82\u201383, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=76}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early history of Gowa and

It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other. By this time, Wajoq had also fallen under Gowa's sphere of influence, and supported Gowa in a war against Bon\u00e9 in the 1560s.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=116, 131\u2013132}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=30}}\n\n=== The ''Tellumpocco'' alliance and the rise of Gowa-Talloq (1582\u20131660) ===\n[[File:South Sulawesi circa 1600.svg|thumb|upright=1|Political division of southern Sulawesi in around 1590]]\n\nThe continued rise of Gowa and its harsh treatment of its Bugis subordinates Wajoq and [[Soppeng|Sopp\u00e9ng]] prompted the latter two to sign the Treaty of Timurung, a mutual defense pact initiated by Bon\u00e9 in 1582.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=132\u2013133}} The relationship between these three allied Bugis polities, also known as the ''[[Tellumpocco]]'' (\"Three Powers\", lit. \"Three Peaks\"), is defined as that of brothers, with Bon\u00e9 acting as the elder, Wajoq the middle, and Sopp\u00e9ng the younger one. It sought to reclaim the autonomy of these Bugis lands, and to stop Gowa's expansionism.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=249}} Gowa's subsequent campaigns against Wajoq in 1582 and 1590 as well as against Bon\u00e9 in 1585 and 1588 were all successfully repulsed by the alliance, or in the case of 1590 campaign, abandoned following the murder of Gowa's ruler [[Tunijalloq]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, by the early 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had succeeded in becoming the most dominant powers in the South Sulawesi peninsula as they bolstered international trade and promoted the new faith of [[Islam]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29, 177}} Between 1608 and 1611, Gowa waged successful campaigns throughout South Sulawesi, forcing Sopp\u00e9ng to embrace Islam in 1609, Wajoq in 1610, and Bon\u00e9 in 1611.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=33}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=136\u2013137}} Thereafter, the ''Tellumpocco'' surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to Gowa, although they were allowed to retain the alliance and still preserve considerable autonomy within their own domains.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}} This arrangement proved to be quite successful to win the support of the Bugis. Wajoq in particular grew increasingly loyal to Gowa. The ''arung matoa'' To Mappassaungng\u00e9 (r. 1627\u20131628{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=576}}) even offered to guard the Gowa capital when its ruler was off for an expedition, despite he was not being obliged to do so.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nWajoq entered another conflict when the ruler of Bon\u00e9, [[La Maddaremmeng]] (r. 1626\u20131643), whether for political or religious reasons, attacked and pillaged P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, one of Wajoq's constituent communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=40}}{{efn|La Maddaremmeng had previously became a subject of controversy, as he had enforced a stricter interpretation of Islam to his people. He also went to abolish non-hereditary slavery in accordance to his belief, and tried to convince the other ''Tellumpocco'' members to follow his steps. This was not received favorably by Gowa, who viewed Bon\u00e9's attempt to spread its religious influence as a direct challenge to its hegemony over South Sulawesi ({{harvnb|Wellen|2014|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}; {{harvnb|Pelras|1996|p=142}}).}} As La Maddaremmeng refused to compensate for the goods seized in P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 went to war against each other.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} Gowa and Sopp\u00e9ng sided with Wajoq in this conflict, and the joint forces succeeded in [[Battle of Passemp\u00e9|defeating Bon\u00e9 in October 1643]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=142}} Bon\u00e9 was harshly punished by being made a vassal of Gowa,{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} with a Bugis noble installed as a [[regent]] responsible to a Makassar lord. A subsequent rebellion led by La Maddaremmeng's brother was also quashed, and Bon\u00e9's status was further degraded to that of a \"slave\" (i.e. a colony), while its nobles were forcibly relocated to Gowa.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=142\u2013143}} Several contested territories held by Bon\u00e9 were given to Wajoq, and a large number of people from Bon\u00e9 were forced into [[Corv\u00e9e|unpaid labor]] in Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=42\u201343}} This humiliation entrenched a feeling of resentment among the people of Bon\u00e9 towards both Gowa and Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=43}}\n\n=== Makassar War and Wajorese migrations (1660\u20131730) ===\nBy the second quarter of the 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had became the most politically and economically powerful polities in eastern Indonesia.

One such conference in the early 18th century saw the codification of laws regulating Wajorese commerce and navigation, popularly called the Ammana Gappa's law code, after the then leader of the Wajorese community in Makassar. These laws set up frameworks for managing credit and debts as well as regulating other kinds of business relationships, providing ways to resolve conflict and giving Wajorese merchants advantages over merchants from other groups in Maritime Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=84, 91, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=64\u201365, 71}} Such a law code, according to historian Kathryn Wellen, is \"highly unusual, if not unique, for early modern insular Southeast Asia\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=84}}\n\nThe government financially supported Wajorese merchants by providing monetary loans, taken from the fund established by La Sal\u00e9wangeng. Borrowers were obliged to return the principals alongside parts of their profits. The profits would then be used to further Wajoq's interest, such as building armaments or renovating the state's mosque. This system allowed a large segment of Wajorese population to participate in commerce while also utilizing their economic power for the benefit of the society as a whole.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82\u201383, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=76}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early history of Gowa and
