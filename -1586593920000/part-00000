Zappa decided to seek out Var\u00e8se's music. After searching for over a year, Zappa found a copy (he noticed the LP because of the \"mad scientist\" looking photo of Var\u00e8se on the cover). Not having enough money with him, he persuaded the salesman to sell him the record at a discount.<ref name=Occhiogrosso />{{rp|30\u201333}} Thus began his lifelong passion for Var\u00e8se's music and that of other modern classical composers.

These have mostly been released on their own label, [[Seeland Records]].  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they produced several recordings for [[SST Records]], most notably ''[[Escape from Noise]]'', ''[[Helter Stupid]]'' and ''[[U2 (EP)|U2]]''.  Negativland were sued by the band [[U2]]'s record label, [[Island Records]], and by [[SST Records]], which brought them widespread publicity and notoriety.\n\n==History==\n\n===1980s===\nNegativland started in [[Concord, California|Concord]], [[California]], in 1979 around the core founding members of Lyons and Hosler (who were in high school at the time), and released an eponymous debut in 1980.\n\nA number of releases followed in the early 1980s, but it wasn't until after the release of their breakthrough sample and cut-up sonic barrage ''[[Escape from Noise]]'' in 1987 that Negativland gained wider attention. Vinyl copies of the album came with \"CAR BOMB\" bumper stickers, in reference to the album's song \"Car Bomb.\"\n\nFollowing the somewhat unexpected success of this album, Negativland faced the prospect of going on a money-losing tour in 1988. To prevent this, they created a [[press release]] which said Negativland were prevented from touring by \"Federal Authority Dick Jordan\" because of claims that Negativland's song \"[[Christianity Is Stupid]]\" had inspired 16-year-old mass murderer [[David Brom]] to kill his family. The press release went on to vigorously deny the purported connection between Negativland and the murders. While Brom had in fact argued with his father about music shortly before Brom killed his family, no one had ever claimed that Brom was spurred to murder by Negativland's music. The claim that Brom's crimes were inspired by Negativland was disseminated and discussed in the [[mass media]], seemingly with little to no fact-checking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://open.salon.com/blog/coryfrye/2009/12/20/negativlands_helter_stupid_20_years_later |title=Negativland's \"Helter Stupid\" 20 Years Later - Cory Frye - Open Salon |publisher=Open.salon.com |accessdate=13 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127031224/http://open.salon.com/blog/coryfrye/2009/12/20/negativlands_helter_stupid_20_years_later |archivedate=November 27, 2013}}, page found at archive.org 2015-10-16.</ref>\n\nThe incident became the foundation for Negativland's next release, ''[[Helter Stupid]]'', which featured a cover photo of TV news anchorman [[Dave McElhatton]] intoning the Brom murder story, with the news station's caption \"Killer Song\" above his head, and a photo of the ax murderer.\n\n=== ''U2'' record incident ===\nNegativland's next project  was the ''[[U2 (EP)|U2]]'' EP, with samples from ''[[American Top 40]]'' host [[Casey Kasem]]. In 1991, Negativland released a single with the title \"U2\" displayed in very large type on the front of the packaging, and \"Negativland\" in a smaller typeface. An image of the [[Lockheed U-2]] spy plane was also on the single cover.\n\nThe songs within were parodies of the group U2's well-known 1987 song \"[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]\", including [[kazoo]]s and extensive sampling of the original song.  The song \"The Letter U And The Numeral 2\" features a musical backing to an extended profane rant from well-known [[disc jockey]] [[Casey Kasem]], lapsing out of his more polished and professional tone during a frustrating rehearsal which had gone out to many stations as raw feed and was taped by several engineers, who had been passing it around for a number of years. One of Kasem's milder comments was \"These guys are from [[England]] and who gives a shit?\" (U2 was actually formed in Ireland. Moments earlier he had read from his script, \"the Irish band from Dublin\".)\n\nU2's label [[Island Records]] quickly sued Negativland, stating that placing the word \"U2\" on the cover violated trademark law, as did the song itself. Island Records also contended that the single was an attempt to deliberately confuse U2 fans, awaiting the impending release of ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', into purchasing what they believed was a new U2 album called ''Negativland''.\n\nIn June 1992, [[R. U. Sirius]], publisher of the magazine ''[[Mondo 2000]]'', came up with an idea. Publicists from U2 had contacted him regarding the possibility of interviewing [[The Edge|Dave \"The Edge\" Evans]], hoping to promote U2's impending multimillion-dollar [[Zoo TV Tour]], which featured found sounds and live sampling from mass media outlets (things for which Negativland had been known for some time). Sirius, unbeknownst to Edge, decided to have his friends Joyce and Hosler of Negativland conduct the interview. Joyce and Hosler, fresh from Island's lawsuit, peppered the Edge with questions regarding his ideas about the use of sampling in their new tour, and the legality of using copyrighted material without permission. Midway through the interview, Joyce and Hosler revealed their identities as members of Negativland. An embarrassed Edge reported that U2 were bothered by the sledgehammer legal approach Island Records took in their lawsuit, and furthermore that much of the legal wrangling took place without U2's knowledge: \"by the time we [U2] realized what was going on it was kinda too late, and we actually did approach the record company on your [Negativland's] behalf and said, 'Look, c'mon, this is just, this is very heavy...'\" Island Records reported to Negativland that U2 never authorized samples of their material; Evans' response was, \"that's complete bollocks, there's like, there's at least six records out there that are direct samples from our stuff.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.negativland.com/news/?page_id=19 |title=Negativland Interviews U2's The Edge |publisher=Negativland.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-24}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2007, Joyce provided an audio cassette copy of the ''Mondo 2000'' interview with Evans to the U2 fan website U2Interview.com. The interview is freely available from this website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Negativland And The Edge|url=http://www.u2interview.com/negativland-mondo-2000-interview/|publisher=U2Interview.com|accessdate=24 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe \"U2\" single (along with other related material) was re-released in 2001 on a \"bootleg\" album entitled ''[[These Guys Are from England and Who Gives a Shit]]'', released on \"Seelard Records\" (a parody of Negativland's record label Seeland Records). Negativland may have themselves been responsible for the re-release; although the Negativland website refers to this release as a bootleg, it is available from major retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Tower Records, as well as Negativland's own mail-order business.\n\nNegativland are interested in [[intellectual property]] rights, and argue that their use of U2's and others' material falls under the [[fair use]] clause. In 1995, they released a book, with accompanying CD, called ''[[Fair Use: The Story of the Letter U and the Numeral 2]]'', about the whole U2 incident (from Island Records first suing Negativland for the release to Negativland gaining back control of their work four years later). The book ends with a large appendix of essays about fair use and copyright by Negativland and others, telling the story with newspaper clippings, court papers, faxes, press releases and other documents arranged in chronological order.  An unfortunate side effect of the Negativland-Island lawsuit was another one brought on between Negativland and SST, which served to sever all remaining ties the two had.  To get back at Negativland (while wryly circumventing their name), SST founder [[Greg Ginn]] later released the ''[[Negativ(e)land: Live on Tour]]'' album on SST.\n\nNegativland were the main subjects of [[Craig Baldwin]]'s documentary ''[[Sonic Outlaws]]'', detailing the use of [[culture jamming]] to subvert the messages of more traditional media outlets. They also made an appearance in Brett Gaylor's 2009 copyright issue documentary, ''[[RiP: A Remix Manifesto]]''.\n\n===ABCs and Teletubbies===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Neg02a.jpg|thumb|left|120px|]]   -->\nIn 1999 Negativland collaborated with [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[anarchist]] band [[Chumbawamba]] to produce the EP ''[[The ABCs of Anarchism]]'', which is largely based around the writings of [[Alexander Berkman]] and [[Cut-up technique|cut-up]] versions of Chumbawamba's hit song \"Tubthumping\", the theme tune to the children's program [[Teletubbies]] and the [[Sex Pistols]]' \"[[Anarchy in the UK]]\".\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, members of Negativland contributed their efforts to [[Creative Commons]], a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to legally build upon and share by providing alternative copyright licenses. In September 2002, Negativland spoofed [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel]] radio stations in an audio track broadcast by pirate radio broadcasters jamming a Seattle Clear Channel station while the National Association of Broadcasters met in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diymedia.net/archive/0803.htm |title=News Archive: August 2003 |publisher=Diymedia.net |accessdate=2010-08-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703001229/http://diymedia.net/archive/0803.htm |archivedate=2010-07-03 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.negativland.com/archives/003kjr/ KJR Prank]. \"Negativland pranks clear channel, forces radio format change.

Recordings of some noteworthy episodes of the show have been released by Seeland in its ''Over the Edge'' series.\n\nIn September 2005, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band, Negativland curated an art exhibit in Manhattan's [[Gigantic Artspace]] gallery. The exhibit, ''Negativlandland'', included a number of pieces of artwork from and inspired by Negativland recordings, video projection of music videos created by the band and others, and some artwork created specifically for the show, such as an animatronic Abraham Lincoln figure (inspired by the band's Lincoln cut-up piece ''God Bull'') and a hands-on exhibit featuring the ''Booper'', the audio-processing unit that band member David Wills (a.k.a. ''The Weatherman'') assembled out of old radio parts. The show appeared in [[Minneapolis]] on May 12, 2006, at Creative Electric Studios.\n\n===2010s===\n\nFormer band member Ian Allen died on January 17, 2015, due to complications from heart valve surgery.

The interview is freely available from this website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Negativland And The Edge|url=http://www.u2interview.com/negativland-mondo-2000-interview/|publisher=U2Interview.com|accessdate=24 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe \"U2\" single (along with other related material) was re-released in 2001 on a \"bootleg\" album entitled ''[[These Guys Are from England and Who Gives a Shit]]'', released on \"Seelard Records\" (a parody of Negativland's record label Seeland Records). Negativland may have themselves been responsible for the re-release; although the Negativland website refers to this release as a bootleg, it is available from major retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Tower Records, as well as Negativland's own mail-order business.\n\nNegativland are interested in [[intellectual property]] rights, and argue that their use of U2's and others' material falls under the [[fair use]] clause. In 1995, they released a book, with accompanying CD, called ''[[Fair Use: The Story of the Letter U and the Numeral 2]]'', about the whole U2 incident (from Island Records first suing Negativland for the release to Negativland gaining back control of their work four years later). The book ends with a large appendix of essays about fair use and copyright by Negativland and others, telling the story with newspaper clippings, court papers, faxes, press releases and other documents arranged in chronological order.  An unfortunate side effect of the Negativland-Island lawsuit was another one brought on between Negativland and SST, which served to sever all remaining ties the two had.  To get back at Negativland (while wryly circumventing their name), SST founder [[Greg Ginn]] later released the ''[[Negativ(e)land: Live on Tour]]'' album on SST.\n\nNegativland were the main subjects of [[Craig Baldwin]]'s documentary ''[[Sonic Outlaws]]'', detailing the use of [[culture jamming]] to subvert the messages of more traditional media outlets. They also made an appearance in Brett Gaylor's 2009 copyright issue documentary, ''[[RiP: A Remix Manifesto]]''.\n\n===ABCs and Teletubbies===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Neg02a.jpg|thumb|left|120px|]]   -->\nIn 1999 Negativland collaborated with [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[anarchist]] band [[Chumbawamba]] to produce the EP ''[[The ABCs of Anarchism]]'', which is largely based around the writings of [[Alexander Berkman]] and [[Cut-up technique|cut-up]] versions of Chumbawamba's hit song \"Tubthumping\", the theme tune to the children's program [[Teletubbies]] and the [[Sex Pistols]]' \"[[Anarchy in the UK]]\".\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, members of Negativland contributed their efforts to [[Creative Commons]], a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to legally build upon and share by providing alternative copyright licenses. In September 2002, Negativland spoofed [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel]] radio stations in an audio track broadcast by pirate radio broadcasters jamming a Seattle Clear Channel station while the National Association of Broadcasters met in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diymedia.net/archive/0803.htm |title=News Archive: August 2003 |publisher=Diymedia.net |accessdate=2010-08-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703001229/http://diymedia.net/archive/0803.htm |archivedate=2010-07-03 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.negativland.com/archives/003kjr/ KJR Prank]. \"Negativland pranks clear channel, forces radio format change.

Recordings of some noteworthy episodes of the show have been released by Seeland in its ''Over the Edge'' series.\n\nIn September 2005, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band, Negativland curated an art exhibit in Manhattan's [[Gigantic Artspace]] gallery. The exhibit, ''Negativlandland'', included a number of pieces of artwork from and inspired by Negativland recordings, video projection of music videos created by the band and others, and some artwork created specifically for the show, such as an animatronic Abraham Lincoln figure (inspired by the band's Lincoln cut-up piece ''God Bull'') and a hands-on exhibit featuring the ''Booper'', the audio-processing unit that band member David Wills (a.k.a.

In some countries such as the [[United States|United States of America]], [[emergency medical technician]]s may administer thrombolytics for heart attacks in prehospital settings, by on-line medical direction. In countries with more extensive and independent qualifications, prehospital thrombolysis ([[fibrinolysis]]) may be initiated by the [[emergency care practitioner]] (ECP). Other countries which employ ECP's include, [[South Africa]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[New Zealand]]. Prehospital thrombolysis is always the result of a risk-benefit calculation of the heart attack, thrombolysis risks, and primary [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (pPCI) availability.\n\n==Contraindications==\nThrombolysis is not without risks. Therefore, clinicians must select patients who are to be best suited for the procedure, and those who have the least risk of having a fatal complication.

{"title_page": "International recognition of Transnistria", "text_new": "{{Politics of Transnistria}}\n'''International recognition of [[Transnistria]]''' (also known as ''Pridnestrovie'') \u2013 a disputed region in [[Eastern Europe]] located between [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]] \u2013 is controversial. Although Transnistria declared independence in 1990, no [[Member states of the United Nations|United Nations member]] recognises its sovereignty and the region is considered by the [[United Nations|UN]] to be part of [[Moldova]]. As of 2011, only [[Abkhazia]], the [[Republic of Artsakh]] and [[South Ossetia]] recognise its independence, all themselves [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]]. Despite not officially recognizing Transnistria's independence, [[Russia]] has established a consulate in the disputed territory.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Political status of Transnistria}}\nIn 1990, a Pridnestrovian Moldavian SSR (PMR) was proclaimed in the region by a number of conservative local Soviet officials opposed to [[perestroika]]. This action was immediately declared void by the then president of the Soviet Union [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Moldova, including Transnistria, became independent. The PMR side said Moldova's declaration of independence was ill-conceived and that it considers the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] to be null and void. The PMR side argues that if this is so, then the Moldovans themselves had agreed to relinquish Transnistria, as this territory never belonged to Moldova, nor to Romania before the signing of the agreement between the [[USSR]] and [[Germany]].\n\nDuring the 1992 [[War of Transnistria]] some villages changed hands between the PMR government and Moldova proper. PMR forces have often clashed with Moldova's representatives.\n\n===Foreign policy===\nGovernment documents from Transnistria state that the republic has \"established and maintained friendly relations with countries seeking recognition.\" To this end, it said that relations would continue to develop in a friendly manner with the three states/political entities it has relations with: the Republic of Abkhazia, the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, and the Republic of South Ossetia.\n\nIt sought to have relations with other foreign countries and international organizations, especially those of Europe, which were seen as \"of paramount importance\". The pro-European orientation was a consequence of a \"general understanding of fundamental values of the world civilization. A lot of Pridnestrovian foreign interests lie in this area. The importance of a harmonic inclusion of Pridnestrovie into the international democratic community makes necessary an active cooperation.\" Another avenue of importance was cooperation with the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] because its importance \"as a mediator in the negotiation process between Moldova and Pridnestrovie... in ensuring regional stability.\" Transnistria's goal was to \"rest on the European experience in the future for its positive political, economic, scientific and technical, and cultural development.\"<ref name=\"transgovt\"/> \n\nTransnistria is member state of the [[Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations]]. The government of Moldova does not actively prevent or seek to prevent representatives of other states from interacting with the government of Transnistria.<ref>Berg, E./Pegg, S.: ''Scrutinizing a Policy of \u201cEngagement without Recognition\u201d: US Requests for Diplomatic Actions with De Facto States'', in: [[Foreign Policy Analysis (journal)|Foreign Policy Analysis]], Vol. 12 (2017).</ref>\n\n== States which formally recognise Transnistria as independent ==\n[[File:Recognition of Transnistria new.svg|thumb|450px|International recognition of Transnistria {{legend|#ff0000|Transnistria}}{{legend|#008000|States that recognise Transnistria as independent}}]]\n\n=== UN non-member states ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% align=center\n! width=175px | Entity !!

Although Transnistria declared independence in 1990, no [[Member states of the United Nations|United Nations member]] recognises its sovereignty and the region is considered by the [[United Nations|UN]] to be part of [[Moldova]]. As of 2011, only [[Abkhazia]], the [[Republic of Artsakh]] and [[South Ossetia]] recognise its independence, all themselves [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]]. Despite not officially recognizing Transnistria's independence, [[Russia]] has established a consulate in the disputed territory.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Political status of Transnistria}}\nIn 1990, a Pridnestrovian Moldavian SSR (PMR) was proclaimed in the region by a number of conservative local Soviet officials opposed to [[perestroika]]. This action was immediately declared void by the then president of the Soviet Union [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Moldova, including Transnistria, became independent. The PMR side said Moldova's declaration of independence was ill-conceived and that it considers the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] to be null and void. The PMR side argues that if this is so, then the Moldovans themselves had agreed to relinquish Transnistria, as this territory never belonged to Moldova, nor to Romania before the signing of the agreement between the [[USSR]] and [[Germany]].\n\nDuring the 1992 [[War of Transnistria]] some villages changed hands between the PMR government and Moldova proper. PMR forces have often clashed with Moldova's representatives.\n\n===Foreign policy===\nGovernment documents from Transnistria state that the republic has \"established and maintained friendly relations with countries seeking recognition.\" To this end, it said that relations would continue to develop in a friendly manner with the three states/political entities it has relations with: the Republic of Abkhazia, the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, and the Republic of South Ossetia.\n\nIt sought to have relations with other foreign countries and international organizations, especially those of Europe, which were seen as \"of paramount importance\". The pro-European orientation was a consequence of a \"general understanding of fundamental values of the world civilization. A lot of Pridnestrovian foreign interests lie in this area. The importance of a harmonic inclusion of Pridnestrovie into the international democratic community makes necessary an active cooperation.\" Another avenue of importance was cooperation with the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] because its importance \"as a mediator in the negotiation process between Moldova and Pridnestrovie... in ensuring regional stability.\" Transnistria's goal was to \"rest on the European experience in the future for its positive political, economic, scientific and technical, and cultural development.\"<ref name=\"transgovt\"/> \n\nTransnistria is member state of the [[Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations]]. The government of Moldova does not actively prevent or seek to prevent representatives of other states from interacting with the government of Transnistria.<ref>Berg, E./Pegg, S.: ''Scrutinizing a Policy of \u201cEngagement without Recognition\u201d: US Requests for Diplomatic Actions with De Facto States'', in: [[Foreign Policy Analysis (journal)|Foreign Policy Analysis]], Vol. 12 (2017).</ref>\n\n== States which formally recognise Transnistria as independent ==\n[[File:Recognition of Transnistria new.svg|thumb|450px|International recognition of Transnistria {{legend|#ff0000|Transnistria}}{{legend|#008000|States that recognise Transnistria as independent}}]]\n\n=== UN non-member states ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% align=center\n! width=175px | Entity !!

He was the first in a series of reform-minded popes from Germany. Suidger was the bishop of Bamberg. In 1046, he accompanied King [[Henry III of Germany]], when at the request of laity and clergy of Rome, Henry went to Italy and summoned the [[Council of Sutri]], which deposed [[Benedict IX]] and [[Sylvester III]], and accepted the resignation of [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory VI]]. Henry suggested Suidger for pope, and he was then elected, taking the name of Clement II. Clement then proceeded to crown Henry as emperor. Clement's brief tenure as pope saw the enactment of more stringent prohibitions against [[simony]].\n\n==Early career==\nBorn in [[Hornburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]], he was the son of Count Konrad of Morsleben and Hornburg and his wife Amulrad. In 1040, he became [[bishop of Bamberg]].<ref name=Loughlin/> \n\nIn the autumn of 1046, there were three rival claimants to the papacy, in St. Peter's, the Lateran, and St. Mary Major's. Two of them, Benedict IX and Sylvester III, represented rival factions of the nobility. The third, Pope Gregory VI, in order to free the city from the House of Tusculum, and Benedict's scandalous lifestyle, had paid Benedict money in exchange for his resignation. Regardless the motives, the transaction bore the appearance of simony. Questions regarding the legitimacy of any of them could undermine the validity of a coronation of Henry as Holy Roman Emperor. King Henry crossed the Alps at the head of a large army and accompanied by a brilliant retinue of the secular and ecclesiastical princes of the empire, for the twofold purpose of receiving the imperial crown and of restoring order.<ref name=Loughlin>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04017a.htm Loughlin, James. \"Pope Clement II.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 26 September 2017</ref>\n\n== Papacy ==\nIn 1046, Suidiger accompanied King Henry on his campaign to Italy and in December, participated in the Council of Sutri, which deposed former [[Benedict IX]] and [[Sylvester III]] and persuaded [[Gregory VI]] to resign. Henry nominated Suidger for the papacy and the council elected him. Suidger insisted upon retaining the bishopric of his see, partly for needed financial support, and partly lest the turbulent Romans should before long send him back to Bamberg. Suidger took the name Clement II. Immediately after his election, Henry and the new pope travelled to Rome, where Clement was enthroned.

He was the first in a series of reform-minded popes from Germany. Suidger was the bishop of Bamberg. In 1046, he accompanied King [[Henry III of Germany]], when at the request of laity and clergy of Rome, Henry went to Italy and summoned the [[Council of Sutri]], which deposed [[Benedict IX]] and [[Sylvester III]], and accepted the resignation of [[Gregory VI]]. Henry suggested Suidger for pope, and he was then elected, taking the name of Clement II. Clement then proceeded to crown Henry as emperor. Clement's brief tenure as pope saw the enactment of more stringent prohibitions against [[simony]].\n\n==Early career==\nBorn in [[Hornburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]], he was the son of Count Konrad of Morsleben and Hornburg and his wife Amulrad. In 1040, he became [[bishop of Bamberg]].<ref name=Loughlin/> \n\nIn the autumn of 1046, there were three rival claimants to the papacy, in St. Peter's, the Lateran, and St. Mary Major's. Two of them, Benedict IX and Sylvester III, represented rival factions of the nobility. The third, Pope Gregory VI, in order to free the city from the House of Tusculum, and Benedict's scandalous lifestyle, had paid Benedict money in exchange for his resignation. Regardless the motives, the transaction bore the appearance of simony. Questions regarding the legitimacy of any of them could undermine the validity of a coronation of Henry as Holy Roman Emperor. King Henry crossed the Alps at the head of a large army and accompanied by a brilliant retinue of the secular and ecclesiastical princes of the empire, for the twofold purpose of receiving the imperial crown and of restoring order.<ref name=Loughlin>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04017a.htm Loughlin, James. \"Pope Clement II.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 26 September 2017</ref>\n\n== Papacy ==\nIn 1046, Suidiger accompanied King Henry on his campaign to Italy and in December, participated in the Council of Sutri, which deposed former [[Benedict IX]] and [[Sylvester III]] and persuaded [[Gregory VI]] to resign. Henry nominated Suidger for the papacy and the council elected him. Suidger insisted upon retaining the bishopric of his see, partly for needed financial support, and partly lest the turbulent Romans should before long send him back to Bamberg. Suidger took the name Clement II. Immediately after his election, Henry and the new pope travelled to Rome, where Clement was enthroned. He then [[coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] Henry III as [[emperor of the Holy Roman Empire]].<ref name=Loughlin/>\n\nClement's election as pope was later criticized by the reform party within the papal curia due to the royal involvement and the fact that the new bishop of Rome was already bishop of another diocese.
