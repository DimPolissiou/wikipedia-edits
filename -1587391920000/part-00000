While it is true that the company has neither lost a [[Jet aircraft|jet airliner]] nor had any jet fatalities, it had eight fatal accidents and an aircraft shot down between 1927 and 1945, with the loss of 63&nbsp;people. Half of these accidents and the shoot-down occurred during World War&nbsp;II, when the Qantas aircraft were operating on behalf of Allied military forces. Post-war, it lost another four aircraft (one was owned by BOAC and operated by Qantas in a pooling arrangement) with a total of 21 people killed.
