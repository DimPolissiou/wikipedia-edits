The capital was also known as Virakshetra or Viravati (Land of Warriors). Later on, it was known as Vadpatraka or Vadodar\u00e1, which according to tradition is a corrupt form of the [[Sanskrit]] word ''vatodar'' meaning in the belly of the Banyan tree. It is now almost impossible to ascertain when the various changes in the name were made; but early English travellers and merchants mention the town as Brodera,<ref name=painting>{{cite web|publisher=Collect Britain, British Library|title=Hand Painting of Bridge over the River Vishwamitri, near Brodera|url=http://www.collectbritain.com/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ0000455C9U00087000&largeimage=1#largeimage|accessdate=3 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928134532/http://www.collectbritain.com/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ0000455C9U00087000&largeimage=1#largeimage|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> and it is from this that the name Baroda is derived.

Most notably, from 1705\u20131716, Sardar [[Senapati]] Khanderao Dabhade led the Maratha Empire forces in Baroda. Except for a short period, Baroda continued to be in the reign of the Gaekwads from 1734 to 1948. Initially detailed to collect revenue on behalf of the [[Peshwa]] in Gujarat, [[Pilaji Gaekwad]] remained there to carve out a kingdom for himself. Damajirao, who was son and successor of Pilaji Gaekwad, defeated the Mughal armies and conquered Baroda in 1734.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> His successors consolidated their power over large tracts of Gujarat, becoming easily the most powerful rulers in the region.\n\nAfter the Maratha defeat in the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> control of the empire by the Peshwas weakened as it became a loose [[Confederation|confederacy]], and the Gaekwad [[Maharaja]]s ruled the kingdom until it [[Instrument of Accession|acceded]] to Independent [[Republic of India]] in 1949. In 1802,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> the British intervened to defend a [[Maharaja]] that had recently inherited the throne from rival claimants, and Vadodara concluded a [[subsidiary alliance]] with the British that recognised the Kingdom as a [[Princely state]] and allowed the Maharajas of Baroda internal political sovereignty in return for recognising British 'Paramountcy', a form of [[suzerainty]] in which the control of the state's foreign affairs was completely surrendered. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe golden period in the Maratha rule of Vadodara started with the accession of [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III|Maharaja Sayajirao III]] in 1875.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nVadodara is located at {{coord|22.30|N|73.19|E|}} in western India at an elevation of {{convert|39|m}}.

The capital was also known as Virakshetra or Viravati (Land of Warriors). Later on, it was known as Vadpatraka or Vadodar\u00e1, which according to tradition is a corrupt form of the [[Sanskrit]] word ''vatodar'' meaning in the belly of the Banyan tree. It is now almost impossible to ascertain when the various changes in the name were made; but early English travellers and merchants mention the town as Brodera,<ref name=painting>{{cite web|publisher=Collect Britain, British Library|title=Hand Painting of Bridge over the River Vishwamitri, near Brodera|url=http://www.collectbritain.com/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ0000455C9U00087000&largeimage=1#largeimage|accessdate=3 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928134532/http://www.collectbritain.com/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ0000455C9U00087000&largeimage=1#largeimage|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> and it is from this that the name Baroda is derived.

Most notably, from 1705\u20131716, Sardar [[Senapati]] Khanderao Dabhade led the Maratha Empire forces in Baroda. Except for a short period, Baroda continued to be in the reign of the Gaekwads from 1734 to 1948. Initially detailed to collect revenue on behalf of the [[Peshwa]] in Gujarat, [[Pilaji Gaekwad]] remained there to carve out a kingdom for himself. Damajirao, who was son and successor of Pilaji Gaekwad, defeated the Mughal armies and conquered Baroda in 1734.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> His successors consolidated their power over large tracts of Gujarat, becoming easily the most powerful rulers in the region.\n\nAfter the Maratha defeat in the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> control of the empire by the Peshwas weakened as it became a loose [[Confederation|confederacy]], and the Gaekwad [[Maharaja]]s ruled the kingdom until it [[Instrument of Accession|acceded]] to Independent [[Republic of India]] in 1949. In 1802,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> the British intervened to defend a [[Maharaja]] that had recently inherited the throne from rival claimants, and Vadodara concluded a [[subsidiary alliance]] with the British that recognised the Kingdom as a [[Princely state]] and allowed the Maharajas of Baroda internal political sovereignty in return for recognising British 'Paramountcy', a form of [[suzerainty]] in which the control of the state's foreign affairs was completely surrendered. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe golden period in the Maratha rule of Vadodara started with the accession of [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III|Maharaja Sayajirao III]] in 1875.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nVadodara is located at {{coord|22.30|N|73.19|E|}} in western India at an elevation of {{convert|39|m}}.

However, he did not take to the work and within two years had run away to sea. He joined a small sailing coaster on the Tees and his early career was spent trading with northern Scottish ports down to South Wales and later the near Continent.\n\nHe settled in [[Stockton-on-Tees]] in the North East of England and in 1862 married Margaret Dobson. It was while living here that he first established a shipbuilding company on the south bank of the Tees while at the same time continuing to work as a captain. The couple produced seven children and moved to Hull in 1883 where Robert continued his business.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nRobert was joined in the business by his three sons, John Robert (Bob), Ernest Bertie (Bert) and Herbert Dobson (Herbie), and continued to expand his fleet with the addition of several steamers. In 1908 he came ashore to manage the business from the office.\n\n===1914\u20131918===\n\nDue to an increased demand for freight tonnage during the [[World War I|Great War]], Robert Rix & Sons increased revenue and profit throughout the period and invested in a ship building programme to modernise its fleet. The company also offloaded a number of older steamers which were fetching higher prices than in peacetime. In 1916 and 1917 Robert Rix & Sons took delivery of two pairs of [[steamships]] from Cochrane & Sons Ltd in [[Selby]], which for the first time bore the family name. These were the Magrix, the Robrix, and Jarrix and the Ebbrix and they set the precedent by which all Rix ships would be named from then on.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n===1920s \u2013 1950s===\n\nThe early 1920s were a difficult period for ship owners due to the depressed economic conditions and the increasing popularity of [[rail freight]], but Robert Rix & Sons continued to grow its fleet with the addition of six ships, many of which were used to work the east coast coal trading routes.\n\nIn November 1925 Robert Rix died following a cerebral haemorrhage, aged 84. He had worked right up to his death, leaving the office the day before along with the rest of the staff.\n\nIn 1927 the roots of the largest company in the J.R. Rix & Sons group, Rix Petroleum Ltd, were established when Robert Rix & Sons began importing tractor vaporising oil to the UK to fuel the post-war agricultural revolution. The company also carried lamp oil from Russia to the Humber on Rix ships. This led to such an expansion that by 1939 the company owned 11 ships spread across four companies.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n===1939 \u2013 1947===\n\nFreight rates increased again before the [[Second World War]] which meant the value of elderly steam coasters rose and Robert Rix & Sons sold a number of vessels. The company also lost two ships during the war; one, the Malrix hit a mine off [[Southend]] in December 1940 and the Pegrix sank off the [[Norfolk]] coast after colliding with Coast Line\u2019s [[Normandy]] Coast.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe company helped the war effort directly in several ways. The Ebbrix was taken for special duties on the east coast of [[Scotland]] as part of the invasion of [[Europe]] and Kenrix\u2019s master, Capt. George Simison, was awarded the Atlantic Star medal for his participation in the Normandy Landings.\n\nDuring the [[war]] years the shipping companies were run by Robert Kenneth Rix (Ken) and the petroleum business by John Leslie Rix (Les), both sons of Bob Rix. After the war, however, Malcolm and Geoffrey Rix, sons of Bert and Herbie respectively, both expressed an interest in joining the firm.\n\nBob felt the company was not big enough to support the extra family members and it was finally decided that the partnership should be dissolved. Bert and Herbie became equal partners in Robert Rix & Sons and Bob, Ken and Les left to establish J.R. Rix & Sons.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nJ.R. Rix & Sons started life on January 1947 with a working capital of \u00a37,000 and one motor ship, the Magrix, in offices in the [[Bank of England]] Chambers, Whitefriargate, Hull, but did not become a [[limited company]] until 14 February 1957. In the meantime, several Rix companies still in existence today were established including Rix Shipping Co Ltd (Rix Shipping), formed in March 1950, and Rix Shipping (Scotland) Ltd, formerly Piggins Rix Ltd, based in Montrose, Scotland.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nPiggins Rix Ltd grew out of Rix Limes Ltd which had been established to supply [[limestone]] mined in quarries in the East Riding of Yorkshire to the Scottish agricultural market. The lime was transported by sea from Hull to Montrose on Rix ships where it was discharged by J.M. Piggins Ltd. J.R. Rix & Sons bought the company \u2013 its first owned interest in Scotland \u2013 and renamed it Piggins Rix Ltd. A short time later Rix Petroleum established a fuel depot there to serve the offshore industry and its growing domestic, [[agricultural]] and [[haulage]] customers.\n\nPiggins Rix Ltd was renamed Rix Shipping (Scotland) Ltd in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//compdetails |title=Companies House WebCheck |publisher=Wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Rix Shipping Ltd==\n\nRix Shipping was formed on 23 March 1950, making it is the oldest company in the J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd group, however it did not become a limited company until 14 February 1957. It started out with a single ship, Magrix (2) but the company soon acquired two further vessels: Roxton, from [[Middlesbrough]] owners, and a ship bought from [[Sweden|Swedish]] owners which the company renamed as the Jarrix (2).\n\nRix Shipping Ltd established regular voyages for [[coal]] from [[Amble]], [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]] and [[Goole]] for [[Teignmouth]], [[Exmouth]], [[Hayle]], [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and [[Penzance]], with back cargoes of [[china clay]] and stone chippings. Another regular cargo was sulphate of [[ammonia]] from the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] or [[River Tees|Tees]] bound for [[Ipswich]] and [[Avonmouth]] and in 1958 Rix Shipping Ltd began carrying agricultural limestone from [[Whitby]] to North Eastern Scottish ports as well as [[chalk]], mined from [[Little Weighton]] in the East Riding of Yorkshire, from Hull.\n\nOver the years the company continued to expand its fleet by both buying ships and commissioning new vessels to be built until by the early sixties it had four motor ships all under five years old. This enabled the business to trade with near continental ports as well as those in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] and [[Bay of Biscay]]. Regular return cargoes included seasonal crops, including French onion sellers who, complete with bikes, were carried in the ship\u2019s hold with the onions.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nToday Rix Shipping Ltd is based at the head office of parent firm, J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd, in Spyvee Street, Hull, and owns and operates a fleet of estuarial tank barges, coastal tankers and high speed crew transfer workboats. Its main business activities include carriage of petroleum products, carriage of engineers to maintain wind turbines and stevedoring services through Hull's [[Port of Hull|King George Dock]] and Montrose in Scotland.\n\nRix Shipping Ltd also owns 25 acres of secure storage and warehousing space close to King George Dock in the east of the city and significant areas of land and warehousing in Montrose.\n\n==Rix Petroleum Ltd==\n\nRix Petroleum Ltd is the largest subsidiary of J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd which turned over \u00a3425.4&nbsp;million in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/yorkshire/news/357109-green-energy-focus-for-rix.html |title=News / Green energy focus for Rix |publisher=Thebusinessdesk.com |date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref> It is headquartered in Hull but has depots across the UK, from Aberdeen down to [[Coleshill, Warwickshire|Coleshill]] in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]].\n\n[[File:Rix Fuel Tanker.jpg|thumb|right|A Rix fuel tanker]]\n[[File:Disused filling station awaiting development - geograph.org.uk - 841314.jpg|thumb|right|A now closed Rix filling station in [[Hornsea]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]].]]\n\nThe roots of Rix Petroleum go back to 1927 when Robert Rix & Sons began importing tractor vaporising oil and lamp oil from [[Russia]] to supply local garages. The war years saw the business expand and supply commercial diesel customers in the East Riding of Yorkshire and the road transport industry. Domestic customers also provided an opportunity for the business as many households converted to cheaper, oil-fired central heating and the agricultural sector opened up as farmers turned from horses to tractors.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe company was incorporated in June 1956 operates a fleet of more than 100 tankers in the UK serving agriculture and agribusiness, hauliers and other fleet-vehicle operators and the residential [[Fuel oil|heating oil]] market customers.\n\nIts red, white and blue logo has remained relatively unchanged for many decades and is a common site on tankers, particularly around [[Yorkshire]], but also in other regions where the business operates.\n\n==Maritime Bunkering Ltd==\n\nThe demand for marine fuel also spawned another Rix company, Maritime Bunkering Ltd, which supplies marine fuels to vessels on the [[Humber Estuary]].\n\n==Jordan & Co (Hull) Ltd==\n\nJordan & Co (Hull) Ltd is a car dealership based in Witham, close to central Hull that is well known locally as a Rix-owned business. The business was established in the early 1900s as a [[bicycle]] retailer based on High Street in Hull City Centre. In the 1920s it progressed to selling [[motorcycles]] and in the 1950s became a car retailer.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the roots of the modern day business were laid down after Rix Petroleum acquired the Jubilee filling station on Holderness Road in the city, which was also the site of a BMC car dealership. The location became the site of Jordans & Co (Hull) Ltd, where it remains to this day. Over time BMC vehicles lost out to more reliable Japanese brands and therefore the company began selling Datsun, which later became Nissan.\n\nJordans, as it is known locally, was recently the subject of a \u00a3300,000 investment in its showroom facilities to become the UK\u2019s first ever [[Fiat]] \"super centre\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Hull-car-dealership-Jordans-undergoing-pound-300k/story-16478972-detail/story.html#axzz2Lu4RAQMD |title=Hull car dealership Jordans undergoing \u00a3300k refit |work= Hull Daily Mail |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Hepworth Shipyard Ltd==\n\nIn 1977 J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd bought the [[Paull]]-based shipbuilder J.R. Hepworth & Co (Hull) Ltd and a formed new company, Hepworth Shipyard Ltd, which built small craft such as [[Fishing trawler|trawlers]] and [[tugs]] at its location on the north bank of the Humber. The yard successfully continued shipbuilding until 2012 and was for many years the last remaining shipbuilder on the Humber as all other yards had turned to repairs only. But after completing the 53m long Lerrix for Rix Shipping Ltd early last year, the company was closed and the premises was let to Dunston (Shipbuilders) Ltd, a new business dedicated to making [[aluminium]] boats for the wind farm industry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Launch-help-economy-power/story-16226227-detail/story.html#axzz2Lu4RAQMD |title=Launch to help our economy power up |work=Hull Daily Mail  |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Fuelmate Ltd==\n\nAlong with its core services of supplying commercial [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and residential heating oil, Rix Petroleum also provided UK fuel cards to help its customers manage their fuel costs effectively. However, as demand for fuel cards increased, J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd decided to create a specialist fuel card supplier to complement the services of Rix Petroleum; in 2008 it launched Fuelmate Ltd.\n\n==Victory Leisure Homes Ltd==\n\nVictory Leisure Homes Ltd is a holiday home and lodge manufacturer established by J.R.

In the meantime, several Rix companies still in existence today were established including Rix Shipping Co Ltd (Rix Shipping), formed in March 1950, and Rix Shipping (Scotland) Ltd, formerly Piggins Rix Ltd, based in Montrose, Scotland.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nPiggins Rix Ltd grew out of Rix Limes Ltd which had been established to supply [[limestone]] mined in quarries in the East Riding of Yorkshire to the Scottish agricultural market. The lime was transported by sea from Hull to Montrose on Rix ships where it was discharged by J.M. Piggins Ltd. J.R. Rix & Sons bought the company \u2013 its first owned interest in Scotland \u2013 and renamed it Piggins Rix Ltd. A short time later Rix Petroleum established a fuel depot there to serve the offshore industry and its growing domestic, [[agricultural]] and [[haulage]] customers.\n\nPiggins Rix Ltd was renamed Rix Shipping (Scotland) Ltd in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//compdetails |title=Companies House WebCheck |publisher=Wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Rix Shipping Ltd==\n\nRix Shipping was formed on 23 March 1950, making it is the oldest company in the J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd group, however it did not become a limited company until 14 February 1957. It started out with a single ship, Magrix (2) but the company soon acquired two further vessels: Roxton, from [[Middlesbrough]] owners, and a ship bought from [[Sweden|Swedish]] owners which the company renamed as the Jarrix (2).\n\nRix Shipping Ltd established regular voyages for [[coal]] from [[Amble]], [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]] and [[Goole]] for [[Teignmouth]], [[Exmouth]], [[Hayle]], [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and [[Penzance]], with back cargoes of [[china clay]] and stone chippings. Another regular cargo was sulphate of [[ammonia]] from the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] or [[Tees]] bound for [[Ipswich]] and [[Avonmouth]] and in 1958 Rix Shipping Ltd began carrying agricultural limestone from [[Whitby]] to North Eastern Scottish ports as well as [[chalk]], mined from [[Little Weighton]] in the East Riding of Yorkshire, from Hull.\n\nOver the years the company continued to expand its fleet by both buying ships and commissioning new vessels to be built until by the early sixties it had four motor ships all under five years old. This enabled the business to trade with near continental ports as well as those in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] and [[Bay of Biscay]]. Regular return cargoes included seasonal crops, including French onion sellers who, complete with bikes, were carried in the ship\u2019s hold with the onions.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nToday Rix Shipping Ltd is based at the head office of parent firm, J.R.

Its main business activities include carriage of petroleum products, carriage of engineers to maintain wind turbines and stevedoring services through Hull's [[Port of Hull|King George Dock]] and Montrose in Scotland.\n\nRix Shipping Ltd also owns 25 acres of secure storage and warehousing space close to King George Dock in the east of the city and significant areas of land and warehousing in Montrose.\n\n==Rix Petroleum Ltd==\n\nRix Petroleum Ltd is the largest subsidiary of J.R.

The war years saw the business expand and supply commercial diesel customers in the East Riding of Yorkshire and the road transport industry. Domestic customers also provided an opportunity for the business as many households converted to cheaper, oil-fired central heating and the agricultural sector opened up as farmers turned from horses to tractors.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe company was incorporated in June 1956 operates a fleet of more than 100 tankers in the UK serving agriculture and agribusiness, hauliers and other fleet-vehicle operators and the residential [[Fuel oil|heating oil]] market customers.\n\nIts red, white and blue logo has remained relatively unchanged for many decades and is a common site on tankers, particularly around [[Yorkshire]], but also in other regions where the business operates.\n\n==Maritime Bunkering Ltd==\n\nThe demand for marine fuel also spawned another Rix company, Maritime Bunkering Ltd, which supplies marine fuels to vessels on the [[Humber Estuary]].\n\n==Jordan & Co (Hull) Ltd==\n\nJordan & Co (Hull) Ltd is a car dealership based in Witham, close to central Hull that is well known locally as a Rix-owned business.

In the 1920s it progressed to selling [[motorcycles]] and in the 1950s became a car retailer.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the roots of the modern day business were laid down after Rix Petroleum acquired the Jubilee filling station on Holderness Road in the city, which was also the site of a BMC car dealership. The location became the site of Jordans & Co (Hull) Ltd, where it remains to this day. Over time BMC vehicles lost out to more reliable Japanese brands and therefore the company began selling Datsun, which later became Nissan.\n\nJordans, as it is known locally, was recently the subject of a \u00a3300,000 investment in its showroom facilities to become the UK\u2019s first ever [[Fiat]] \"super centre\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Hull-car-dealership-Jordans-undergoing-pound-300k/story-16478972-detail/story.html#axzz2Lu4RAQMD |title=Hull car dealership Jordans undergoing \u00a3300k refit |work= Hull Daily Mail |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Hepworth Shipyard Ltd==\n\nIn 1977 J.R.

[[John Milford]] appeared in eight episodes as the historical [[Ike Clanton]]. In seven episodes in 1959 and 1961, [[Carol Thurston]] played the fictitious Emma Clanton, daughter of Old Man Clanton and an unlikely romantic interest for Earp. Thurston also was cast in different roles in four earlier episodes before she landed the continuing role as Emma Clanton. [[James Seay]] was cast 16 times as Judge Spicer, who became a close friend of Earp's.\n\n[[William Phipps (actor)|William Phipps]] in 16 episodes played the gunman and rustler [[William Brocius|Curly Bill Brocius]]. In the episode \"The Clantons' Family Row\", Brocius is facing a potential gunfight with [[Johnny Ringo]] (Peter M.

A town mob demands that Curly Bill be hanged, but Earp places [[dynamite]] under the main street to protect his prisoner until the trial. Earp must defend Curly Bill in court because White accidentally caused Curly Bill's gun to discharge; White signed a statement attesting to the facts prior to his death.

Many episodes show Douglas Fowley as playing the part of Doc Fabrique when he actually is not in the episodes.  O'Flynn was left off the credits most of the time.  In \"Frontier Surgeon\" (January 19, 1960), Dr. Goodfellow must obtain a truce with Marshal Earp, who is apprehending a wounded outlaw. The man will die if moved after surgery, but he does not wait the three days to recuperate out of distrust of Earp and the protection of the $15,000 loot his gang and he have taken from [[Wells Fargo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631786/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_181|title=\"Frontier Surgeon\" (January 19, 1960)|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Coy]] appeared twice on ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'', as Henry Mason in \"The Doctor\" (1960) and as [[Ben Thompson (lawman)|Ben Thompson]] in \"Dodge Is Civilized\" (1959).

Each codon is translated into a single [[amino acid]]. Therefore, a shift of any number of nucleotides that is not divisible by 3 in the reading frame will result in subsequent codons to be read differently.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ivanov IP, Atkins JF | title = Ribosomal frameshifting in decoding antizyme mRNAs from yeast and protists to humans: close to 300 cases reveal remarkable diversity despite underlying conservation | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 1842\u20131858 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17332016 | pmc = 1874602 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkm035 }}</ref> This effectively changes the ribosomal [[reading frame]].

In the case where a frameshift results in nonsense, the NMD ([[Nonsense-mediated decay|nonsense-mediated mRNA decay]]) pathway may destroy the mRNA transcript, so frameshifting would serve as a method of regulating the expression level of the associated gene.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dever TE, Dinman JD, Green R | title = Translation Elongation and Recoding in Eukaryotes | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = a032649 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 29610120 | pmc = 6071482 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a032649 }}</ref>\n\n== Function ==\nIn viruses this phenomenon may be programmed to occur at particular sites and allows the virus to encode multiple types of proteins from the same mRNA.

Because the structure of this motif contains 2 adjacent 3-nucleotide repeats it is believed that \u22121 frameshifting is described by a tandem slippage model, in which the ribosomal P-site tRNA anticodon re-pairs from XXY to XXX and the A-site anticodon re-pairs from YYZ to YYY simultaneously. These new pairings are identical to the 0-frame pairings except at their third positions. This difference does not significantly disfavor anticodon binding because the third nucleotide in a codon, known as the [[Wobble base pair|wobble position]], has weaker tRNA anticodon binding specificity than the first and second nucleotides.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Crick FH | title = Codon\u2014anticodon pairing: the wobble hypothesis | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 548\u2013555 | date = August 1966 | pmid = 5969078 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(66)80022-0 }}</ref> In this model, the motif structure is explained by the fact that the first and second positions of the anticodons must be able to pair perfectly in both the 0 and \u22121 frames.

In the case of +1 frameshifting, the slippery sequence contains codons for which the corresponding tRNA is more rare, and the frameshift is favored because the codon in the new frame has a more common associated tRNA.<ref name=\":5\" /> One example of a slippery sequence is the [[Polyadenylation|polyA]] on mRNA, which is known to induce ribosome slippage even in the absence of any other elements.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arthur L, Pavlovic-Djuranovic S, Smith-Koutmou K, Green R, Szczesny P, Djuranovic S | title = Translational control by lysine-encoding A-rich sequences | journal = Science Advances | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = e1500154 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26322332 | pmc = 4552401 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1500154 | bibcode = 2015SciA....1E0154A }}</ref>\n\n==== RNA secondary structure ====\nEfficient ribosomal frameshifting generally requires the presence of an RNA secondary structure to enhance the effects of the slippery sequence.<ref name=\":0\" /> The RNA structure (which can be a [[stem-loop]] or [[pseudoknot]]) is thought to pause the ribosome on the slippery site during translation, forcing it to relocate and continue replication from the \u22121 position.

The secondary \"stem-loop\" structures, where \"stems\" are formed by a region of mRNA base pairing with another region on the same strand, are shown protruding from the linear DNA.

Because the structure of this motif contains 2 adjacent 3-nucleotide repeats it is believed that \u22121 frameshifting is described by a tandem slippage model, in which the ribosomal P-site tRNA anticodon re-pairs from XXY to XXX and the A-site anticodon re-pairs from YYZ to YYY simultaneously. These new pairings are identical to the 0-frame pairings except at their third positions.

The secondary \"stem-loop\" structures, where \"stems\" are formed by a region of mRNA base pairing with another region on the same strand, are shown protruding from the linear DNA.
