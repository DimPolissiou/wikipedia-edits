During the Middle Ages the word ''cunt'' may often have been considered merely vulgar, having been in common use in its anatomical sense since at least the 13th century.

Matamoros ([[Moors|Moor]] killer) however remains a common place name, [[Matamoros (disambiguation)|surname]],<!--intentional link to DAB page--> and even the name of several businesses in Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nIn Hong Kong, many place names contain reference to [[feces]] and [[urine]] (\u5c4e and \u5c3f in Chinese, transcribed to ''Shi'' and ''Niu'' respectively). Some of those settled places have got the name changed to avoid the offensiveness, for example, [[Ma Liu Shui]] and [[Fung Mei Wai|Kau Shi Wai]], although in the former case the word ''Niu'' is just a [[homonym]] of another character ''\u5afd'' (''Liu'', literally meaning playing).\n\nA number of placenames in the United States and Canada historically used the word \"[[nigger]]\", a derogatory term for [[black people]]. Over the course of the 20th century, many of these place names were changed because of the racist connotations of the word.

The Japanese-language name of the university ({{nihongo|\u8fd1\u757f\u5927\u5b66|Kinki daigaku}}) was left unchanged. The change was globally reported, though since its founding in 1949, the original name was not a problem within Japan.  However, with the dramatic globalization of Japanese universities in recent decades, including the presence of hundreds of foreign students, staff, faculty, and visiting scholars on campus, the leadership of the university made the change in 2016, after deciding to do so in 2014.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/21/kinki-university-changes-name-kindai</ref>\n\nWaters, Arkansas changed its name to [[Pine Ridge, Arkansas]] after it became known that the fictional town [[Pine Ridge (Lum and Abner)|Pine Ridge]] in radio sitcom ''[[Lum and Abner]]'' was based on Waters.

A number of Norwegian towns are named ''\u00c5''. The name often comes from the [[Old Norse]] word ''\u00c1r'', meaning small river.

The Dutch diagraph [[IJ (digraph)|IJ]], although typed using two characters, is sometimes considered a ligature, or even a single letter in itself.\n\nThere are a number of place names that seem unusual to English speakers because they do not conform to standard English orthography rules. Examples include the Welsh towns of [[Ysbyty Ystwyth]] and [[Bwlchgwyn]] which appear to English speakers to contain no vowel characters, although ''y'' and ''w'' represent vowel sounds in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/fun-stuff/14-welsh-place-names-no-6263550| title=14 Welsh Place Names With No (English) Vowels| publisher=Wales Online| date=1 November 2013| last=Rowland| first=Paul}}</ref> [[Aioi, Hy\u014dgo|Aioi, Japan]]; [[Eiao|Eiao, Marquesas Islands]]; [[Aiea, Hawaii]];<ref group=note>Aiea has an initial [[glottal stop]] in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], which was dropped in English orthography.</ref> [[Oia, Greece]]; and [[Ii, Finland]], on the other hand, contain only vowels and no consonants.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=The Journal of Recreational Linguistics| volume=7-8| title=Word Ways| last=Eckler| first=Albert Ross| year=1969| pages=146| publisher=Word Ways}}</ref>\n\nUnusual names may also be created as a result of error by the naming authority.

The term \"enlightenment\" was popularised in the Western world through the 19th century translations of [[Max M\u00fcller]]. It has the western connotation of a sudden insight into a transcendental truth or reality.\n\nThe term is also being used to translate several other Buddhist terms and concepts, which are used to denote insight (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'', ''[[kensho]]'' and ''[[satori]]'');{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=5051, lemma \"bodhi\"}} knowledge (''[[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidhya]]''); the \"blowing out\" (''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]]'') of disturbing emotions and desires and the subsequent freedom or release (''[[vimutti]]''); and the attainment of [[Buddhahood]], as exemplified by [[Gautama Buddha]].\n\nWhat exactly constituted the Buddha's awakening is unknown. It may probably have involved the knowledge that liberation was attained by the combination of mindfulness and ''[[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]'', applied to the understanding of the arising and ceasing of craving. The relation between ''dhyana'' and insight is a core problem in the study of Buddhism, and is one of the fundamentals of Buddhist practice.\n\nIn the western world the concept of spiritual enlightenment has become synonymous with [[self-realization]] and the [[true self and false self]], being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning.{{sfn|Carrette|King|2005}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}<sup>, </sup>{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}<sup>, </sup>{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}<sup>, </sup>{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Hinduism===\nIn [[Indian religion]]s ''moksha'' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|\u092e\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0937}} ''{{IAST|mok\u1e63a}}''; liberation) or ''mukti'' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|\u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f}}; release \u2014both from the root ''{{IAST|muc}}'' \"to let loose, let go\") is the final extrication of the [[soul]] or consciousness (''purusha'') from ''[[samsara]]'' and the bringing to an end of all the [[suffering]] involved in being subject to the cycle of repeated death and  [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] ([[reincarnation]]).\n\n====Advaita Vedanta====\n{{Main article|Advaita Vedanta|Neo-Advaita}}\n\n''Advaita Vedanta'' ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|Advaita Ved\u0101nta}}''; [[Sanskrit]]: \u0905\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0924 \u0935\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924 {{IPA-sa|\u0250d\u028bait\u0250 \u028be\u02d0da\u02d0nt\u0250|}}) is a [[List of philosophical concepts|philosophical concept]] where followers seek liberation/release by recognizing identity of the Self (Atman) and the Whole (Brahman) through long preparation and training, usually under the guidance of a [[guru]], that involves efforts such as knowledge of scriptures, renunciation of worldly activities, and inducement of direct identity experiences.

Its philosophy and practice emphasize the necessity of self-effort to move the [[Jiva|soul]] toward divine consciousness and [[Moksa (Jainism)|liberation]]. Any soul that has conquered its own inner enemies and achieved the state of supreme being is called a ''jina'' (\"conqueror\" or \"victor\"). The ultimate status of these perfect souls is called [[siddha]]. Ancient texts also refer to Jainism as ''[[shramana]] dharma'' (self-reliant) or the \"path of the [[nirgrantha|nirgantha]]s\" (those without attachments or aversions).\n\nIn [[Jainism]] highest form of pure knowledge a soul can attain is called [[Kevala Jnana]] ( Sanskrit : \u0915\u0947\u0935\u0932\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 )or Kevala \u1e46\u0101\u1e47a (Prakrit : \u0915\u0947\u0935\u0932 \u0923\u093e\u0923).  which means \"absolute or perfect\" and J\u00f1\u0101na, which means \"knowledge\". Kevala is the state of isolation of the j\u012bva from the aj\u012bva attained through ascetic practices which burn off one's karmic residues, releasing one from bondage to the cycle of death and rebirth. Kevala J\u00f1\u0101na thus means infinite knowledge of self and non-self, attained by a soul after annihilation of the all  [[Karma in Jainism#Ghatiya karmas|gh\u0101tiy\u0101 karmas]]. The soul which has reached this stage achieves [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] or liberation at the end of its life span.\n\n[[Mahavira]], 24th thirthankara of Jainism, is said to have practised rigorous austerities for 12 years before he attained enlightenment,\n\n{{quote|During the thirteenth year, in the second month of summer, in the fourth fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Vaisakha, on its tenth day, when the shadow had turned towards the east and the first wake was over, on the day called Suvrata, in the Muhurta called Vigaya, outside of the town Grimbhikagrama on the bank of the river Rjupalika, not far from an old temple, in the field of the householder Samaga, under a Sal tree, when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism [[Nakshatra#Nakshatra descriptions|Uttara Phalguni]], (the Venerable One) in a [[squatting position]] with joined heels, exposing himself to the heat of the sun, after fasting two and a half days without drinking water, being engaged in deep meditation, reached the highest knowledge and intuition, called Kevala, which is infinite, supreme, unobstructed, unimpeded, complete, and full.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}}}\n\nKevala J\u00f1\u0101na is one of the five major events in the life of a [[Tirthankara]] and is known as Keval J\u00f1\u0101na Kalyanaka and celebrated of all gods. Lord Mahavira's Kaivalya was said to have been celebrated by the demi-gods, who constructed the [[Samosarana]] or a grand preaching assembly for him.\n\n==Western understanding==\nIn the Western world the concept of ''enlightenment'' in a religious context acquired a [[Romanticism|romantic]] meaning. It has become synonymous with [[self-realization]] and the [[True self and false self|true self]], which is being regarded as a substantial essence which is covered over by social conditioning.{{refn|group=note|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was an important influence on the development of this idea. See for example [[Rajneesh#Ego and the mind|Osho's teachings]] for a popularisation of this idea.}}\n\n===As 'Aufkl\u00e4rung'===\n{{Main article|Age of Enlightenment}}\n\nThe use of the Western word ''enlightenment'' is based on the supposed resemblance of ''bodhi'' with ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Aufkl\u00e4rung]]'', the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world. As a matter of fact there are more resemblances with [[Romanticism]] than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p = 181-183}}\n\n===Awakening: Historical period of renewed interest in religion===\nThe equivalent term \"awakening\" has also been used in a Christian context,<ref>J.

Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century.

The notion of \"religious experience\" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}\n\nIt was popularised by the [[Transcendentalists]], and exported to Asia via missionaries.{{sfn|King|2002}} Transcendentalism developed as a reaction against 18th-century rationalism, [[John Locke]]'s philosophy of [[Sensualism]], and the predestinationism of New England Calvinism. It is fundamentally a variety of diverse sources such as Hindu texts like the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p = 3}} various religions, and [[German idealism]].{{sfn|Hart|1995}}\n\nIt was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p = 271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding \"enlightenment\", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: \"It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action.

Several definitions or meanings are combined in this approach, which makes it possible to recognize various traditions as having the same essence.{{sfn|Katz|2007}} According to Renard, many forms of religion are based on an experiential or intuitive understanding of \"the Real\"{{sfn|Renard|2010|p = 59}}\n\nThis idea of nonduality as \"the central essence\"{{sfn|Wolfe|2009|p = iii}} is part of a modern mutual exchange and synthesis of ideas between western spiritual and esoteric traditions and Asian religious revival and reform movements.{{refn|group=note|See McMahan, \"The making of Buddhist modernity\"{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and Rambachan, \"The Limits of Scripture: Vivekananda's Reinterpretation of the Vedas\"{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} for descriptions of this mutual exchange.}} Western predecessors are, among others, [[New Age]],{{sfn|Hanegraaf|1996}} [[Ken Wilber|Wilber's]] synthesis of western psychology and Asian spirituality, the idea of a [[Perennial Philosophy]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. Eastern influences are the [[Hindu reform movements]] such as [[Shri Aurobindo|Aurobindo's]] Integral Yoga and [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda's]] [[Advaita Vedanta#Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta]], the [[Vipassana movement]], and [[Buddhist modernism]]. A truly syncretistic influence is [[Rajneesh|Osho]]{{sfn|Swartz|2010|p = 306}} and the [[Rajneesh movement]], a hybrid of eastern and western ideas and teachings, and a mainly western group of followers.{{sfn|Aveling|1999}}\n\n==Cognitive aspects==\n===Religious experience as cognitive construct===\n\"Religious experiences\" have \"evidential value\",{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}} since they confirm the specific worldview of the experiencer:{{sfn|Yandell|1994}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}\n{{quote|These experiences are ''cognitive'' in that, allegedly at least, the subject of the experience receives a reliable and accurate view of what, religiously considered, are the most important features of things.

The psychological effects of these substances have been subject to scientific research focused on understanding their physiological basis.  While entheogens do produce glimpses of higher spiritual states, these are always temporary, fading with the effects of the substance.

Related terms from Asian religions are ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation) in [[Hinduism]],  ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' in [[Jainism]], and ''ushta'' in [[Zoroastrianism]].\n\nIn Christianity, the word \"enlightenment\" is rarely used, except to refer to the Age of Enlightenment and its influence on Christianity.

The term \"enlightenment\" was popularised in the Western world through the 19th century translations of [[Max M\u00fcller]].

As a matter of fact there are more resemblances with [[Romanticism]] than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p = 181-183}}\n\n===Awakening: Historical period of renewed interest in religion===\nThe equivalent term \"awakening\" has also been used in a Christian context,<ref>J.

Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these \"Great Awakenings\" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.\n\n===Illumination===\n{{Main article|Divine illumination}}\n\nAnother equivalent term is [[Illuminationism]], which was also used by Paul Demieville in his work ''The Mirror of the Mind'', in which he made a distinction between \"illumination subie\" and \"illumination graduelle\".{{sfn|Demieville|1991}}<ref group=web>[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/ChanZenStudies.htm Bernard Faure, ''Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field'']</ref> Illuminationism is a [[doctrine]] according to which the process of human thought needs to be aided by divine grace.

This notion can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term \"religious experience\" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p = 47}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of \"religious experience\" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768\u20131834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of \"religious experience\" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}\n\nIt was popularised by the [[Transcendentalists]], and exported to Asia via missionaries.{{sfn|King|2002}} Transcendentalism developed as a reaction against 18th-century rationalism, [[John Locke]]'s philosophy of [[Sensualism]], and the predestinationism of New England Calvinism. It is fundamentally a variety of diverse sources such as Hindu texts like the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p = 3}} various religions, and [[German idealism]].{{sfn|Hart|1995}}\n\nIt was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p = 271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding \"enlightenment\", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: \"It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion.\"{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}\n\nThe notion of \"experience\" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p = 282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p = 12}} Robert Sharf points out that \"experience\" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: \"[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience \"altered states\" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference point for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the \"path\".{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C|p=1}}}} The notion of \"experience\" introduces a false notion of duality between \"experiencer\" and \"experienced\", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the \"non-duality\" of observer and observed.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p = 30}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p = 82}} \"Pure experience\" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p = 282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p = 80-82}} The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what \"experience\" someone has, which means that this \"experience\" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p = 80}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by \"cleansing the doors of perception\",{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: \"If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.

More commonly used terms in the Christian tradition are [[religious conversion]] and [[revelation]].\n\n[[Lewis Sperry Chafer]] (1871\u20131952), one of the founders of [[Dispensationalism]], uses the word \"[[illuminism]]\". Christians who are \"illuminated\" are of two groups, those who have experienced true illuminism (biblical) and those who experienced false illuminism (not from the Holy Spirit).{{sfn|Chafer|1993|p = 12\u201314}}\n\nChristian interest in eastern spirituality has grown throughout the 20th century. Notable Christians, such as [[Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle]] and [[Ama Samy|AMA Samy]], have participated in Buddhist training and even become Buddhist teachers themselves. In a few places Eastern contemplative techniques have been integrated in Christian practices, such as centering prayer.<ref group=\"web\">[http://www.centeringprayer.com/ Contemplative Outreach: Centering Prayer]</ref> But this integration has also raised questions about the borders between these traditions.<ref group=\"web\">[http://www.innerexplorations.com/ewtext/chen.htm Inner Explorations: Christian Enlightenment?]</ref>\n\n===Western esotericism and mysticism===\n{{Main article|Mysticism|Western esotericism|Perennial philosophy}}\nWestern and Mediterranean culture has a rich tradition of [[esotericism]] and [[mysticism]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996}} The [[Perennial philosophy]], basic to the [[New Age]] understanding of the world, regards those traditions as akin to [[Eastern religions]] which aim at awakening/ enlightenment and developing wisdom. The hypothesis that all mystical traditions share a \"common core\",{{sfn|Hood|2001|p = 32}} is central to New Age, but contested by a diversity of scientists like Katz and Proudfoot.{{sfn|Hood|2001|p = 32}}\n\n[[Judaism]] includes the mystical tradition of [[Kabbalah]]. [[Islam]] includes the mystical tradition of [[Sufism]]. In the [[Fourth Way]] teaching, enlightenment is the highest state of Man (humanity).{{sfn|Ouspensky|year unknown}}\n\n===Nondualism===\n{{Main article|Nondualism|New Age|Syncretism|Neo-Advaita}}\n\nA popular western understanding sees \"enlightenment\" as \"nondual consciousness\", \"a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object\".<ref group=\"web\">{{Cite web |url=http://undividedjournal.com/about-the-journal/ |title=Undivided Journal, ''About the Journal'' |access-date=2013-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823200254/http://undividedjournal.com/about-the-journal/ |archive-date=2018-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is used interchangeably with Neo-Advaita.\n\nThis nondual consciousness is seen as a common stratum to different religions.

A truly syncretistic influence is [[Rajneesh|Osho]]{{sfn|Swartz|2010|p = 306}} and the [[Rajneesh movement]], a hybrid of eastern and western ideas and teachings, and a mainly western group of followers.{{sfn|Aveling|1999}}\n\n==Cognitive aspects==\n===Religious experience as cognitive construct===\n\"Religious experiences\" have \"evidential value\",{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}} since they confirm the specific worldview of the experiencer:{{sfn|Yandell|1994}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}\n{{quote|These experiences are ''cognitive'' in that, allegedly at least, the subject of the experience receives a reliable and accurate view of what, religiously considered, are the most important features of things.

The name is likely originally an accusative plural form of a masculine personal name, preserved today in the surname ''Bevk''.

This disorder displays X-linked inheritance.\n\n== Mechanism ==\n\n=== Pathophysiology ===\nThe primary symptoms of Wilson-Turner Syndrome is believed to result from an improperly developed [[histone deacetylase]] 8. This enzyme is coded by the HDAC8 gene. The identified mutation in the HDAC8 gene leads to a version of histone deacetylase 8 that is missing a segment. Histone deacetylase 8 is believed to be a regulator of the cohesion complex, playing a role in stabilizing the cell\u2019s genetic information, repairing damaged DNA, and controlling gene activity.  This abnormally shortened protein alters gene regulations during the individual\u2019s normal development. Some of the effected normal development lies in the [[endocrine system]]. Males will have more [[estrogen]] and [[androgen]] than normal, leading to enlarged hypogonadism and gynecomastia. Other abnormal development is related to general mental capacity.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[HDAC]]<nowiki/>s are known to be associated with human brain development disorders.<ref name=\":5\" /> HDAC8, in particular, represses transcription factors in neural crest cells to control various patterns of the skull.<ref name=\":5\" /> This contributes to the various forms of facial deformities in individuals with Wilson-Turner Syndrome. Some of the facial deformities caused by the HDAC8 include prominent supraorbital ridges and high cheekbones. Researchers also contribute the error in the HDAC8 gene to obesity. Since the HDAC family proteins are involved in changes in the gene expression in the [[hypothalamus]], it is also believed that the individual\u2019s [[metabolism]] conditions are altered.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Fasting and High-Fat Diet Alter Histone Deacetylase Expression in the Medial Hypothalamus|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2011-04-15|pmc = 3078138|pmid = 21526203|pages = e18950|volume = 6|issue = 4|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0018950|first = Hiromasa|last = Funato|first2 = Satoko|last2 = Oda|first3 = Junko|last3 = Yokofujita|first4 = Hiroaki|last4 = Igarashi|first5 = Masaru|last5 = Kuroda}}</ref>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\n=== Techniques ===\nThe diagnosis of Wilson\u2013Turner syndrome is based upon a clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic features. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the HDAC8 gene is now available to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n=== Criteria ===\nThe Wilson\u2013Turner syndrome is characterized by mild to moderate range of intellectual disability, obesity, tapered fingers, and mood swings. Males also suffer from gynecomastia and hypogonadism. In order to be diagnosed with Wilson-Turner Syndrome, male patients must suffer from intellectual disability, obesity, and gynecomastia. Females do not necessarily have to have noticeable phenotype but can be diagnosed with this disorder by studying her family history and identifying others with the disorder. It has been noted that children with Wilson-Turner Syndrome will display speech development delay and excessive drooling. Males can be confirmed by testing androgen levels.<ref name=\":2\" /> Female carriers will show silencing of the gene a complex [[X-inactivation|X inactivation]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|title = Disease: 309585 - GenePeeks Research|url = https://research.genepeeks.com/diseases/309585/|website = research.genepeeks.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Family and medical history ===\nFamily medical history is studied in depth due to its X-linked inheritance. The families that were studied and diagnosed with Wilson-Turner Syndrome have shown X-linked recessive pedigree pattern. This disorder only have been identified in two families, thus there is still ongoing studies concerning other inherited factors that may contribute to this disorder.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Screening ==\nScreening methods are mostly done for females to determine if they are carriers. Males do not have to be tested because those with the disorder will show symptoms close to the time they are born because the disorder is inherited from the X chromosome. Females can be tested if they are carriers by performing a X chromosome inactivation analysis on DNA isolated from the peripheral lymphocytes. The CAG repeat in this section must be amplified and methylated DNA must be sorted from unmethylated DNA with PCR.

This disorder displays X-linked inheritance.\n\n== Mechanism ==\n\n=== Pathophysiology ===\nThe primary symptoms of Wilson-Turner Syndrome is believed to result from an improperly developed [[histone deacetylase]] 8. This enzyme is coded by the HDAC8 gene. The identified mutation in the HDAC8 gene leads to a version of histone deacetylase 8 that is missing a segment. Histone deacetylase 8 is believed to be a regulator of the cohesion complex, playing a role in stabilizing the cell\u2019s genetic information, repairing damaged DNA, and controlling gene activity.  This abnormally shortened protein alters gene regulations during the individual\u2019s normal development. Some of the effected normal development lies in the [[endocrine system]]. Males will have more [[estrogen]] and [[androgen]] than normal, leading to enlarged hypogonadism and gynecomastia. Other abnormal development is related to general mental capacity.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[HDAC]]<nowiki/>s are known to be associated with human brain development disorders.<ref name=\":5\" /> HDAC8, in particular, represses transcription factors in neural crest cells to control various patterns of the skull.<ref name=\":5\" /> This contributes to the various forms of facial deformities in individuals with Wilson-Turner Syndrome. Some of the facial deformities caused by the HDAC8 include prominent supraorbital ridges and high cheekbones. Researchers also contribute the error in the HDAC8 gene to obesity. Since the HDAC family proteins are involved in changes in the gene expression in the [[hypothalamus]], it is also believed that the individual\u2019s [[metabolism]] conditions are altered.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Fasting and High-Fat Diet Alter Histone Deacetylase Expression in the Medial Hypothalamus|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2011-04-15|pmc = 3078138|pmid = 21526203|pages = e18950|volume = 6|issue = 4|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0018950|first = Hiromasa|last = Funato|first2 = Satoko|last2 = Oda|first3 = Junko|last3 = Yokofujita|first4 = Hiroaki|last4 = Igarashi|first5 = Masaru|last5 = Kuroda}}</ref>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\n=== Techniques ===\nThe diagnosis of Wilson\u2013Turner syndrome is based upon a clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic features. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the HDAC8 gene is now available to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n=== Criteria ===\nThe Wilson\u2013Turner syndrome is characterized by mild to moderate range of intellectual disability, obesity, tapered fingers, and mood swings. Males also suffer from gynecomastia and hypogonadism. In order to be diagnosed with Wilson-Turner Syndrome, male patients must suffer from intellectual disability, obesity, and gynecomastia. Females do not necessarily have to have noticeable phenotype but can be diagnosed with this disorder by studying her family history and identifying others with the disorder. It has been noted that children with Wilson-Turner Syndrome will display speech development delay and excessive drooling. Males can be confirmed by testing androgen levels.<ref name=\":2\" /> Female carriers will show silencing of the gene a complex [[X-inactivation|X inactivation]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|title = Disease: 309585 - GenePeeks Research|url = https://research.genepeeks.com/diseases/309585/|website = research.genepeeks.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Family and medical history ===\nFamily medical history is studied in depth due to its X-linked inheritance. The families that were studied and diagnosed with Wilson-Turner Syndrome have shown X-linked recessive pedigree pattern. This disorder only have been identified in two families, thus there is still ongoing studies concerning other inherited factors that may contribute to this disorder.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Screening ==\nScreening methods are mostly done for females to determine if they are carriers. Males do not have to be tested because those with the disorder will show symptoms close to the time they are born because the disorder is inherited from the X chromosome. Females can be tested if they are carriers by performing a X chromosome inactivation analysis on DNA isolated from the peripheral lymphocytes. The CAG repeat in this section must be amplified and methylated DNA must be sorted from unmethylated DNA with PCR. Carrier females will show skewed X-inactivation pattern (skewing close to 100%) with the mutated [[allele]] inactivated.

Due to declining ratings, and the larger secular decline of music-based television in favor of online services, MTV would announce the cancellation of ''TRL'' on  September 15, 2008.<ref name=\"Report: MTV to Cancel TRL\">{{cite news|title=Report: MTV to Cancel TRL|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6596363.html|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> The special three-hour finale episode, ''Total Finale Live'', aired on November 16, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1597023/20081014/knowles_beyonce.jhtml|title=Beyonce To Perform On 'TRL' Finale|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nLess than a decade later, ''TRL'' would be revived on October 2, 2017.<ref name=\"MTV Mines the Past\">{{cite web|last1=Koblin|first1=John|title=MTV Mines the Past for Its Future: \u2018Total Request Live\u2019|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/business/media/mtv-total-request-live-revival.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> In 2019, the show aired Saturday mornings at 10am ET as ''TRL Top 10''.\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\n''Total Request Live'' originated from several pre-existing programs on [[MTV]]. ''[[Dial MTV]]'', the first video request show on the network, had aired from 1986 to 1996. In 1997, MTV launched two new shows that became the predecessors of ''TRL'': ''[[Total Request]]'', a revival of the ''Dial MTV'' concept hosted by [[Carson Daly]], and ''[[MTV Live (U.S. TV program)|MTV Live]]'', which was hosted by [[Toby Amies]] and featured live performances and interviews from musical artists.\n\n{{MTV}}\n''Total Request'' was more subdued than ''MTV Live'', as Daly introduced music videos from an empty, dimly lit set. As the show progressed and gained more momentum with viewers tuning in, it was soon added to the list of daytime programming during MTV's ''Summer Share'' in [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]]. The countdown would prove to be one of the most watched and most interactive shows in recent MTV history, demonstrating that it had potential to become an even larger success by combining with the element of live television.\n\n===Original Run (1998-2008)===\n====Carson Daly era ====\nIn Fall 1998, MTV producers merged the real-time aspect of ''MTV Live'' with the fan-controlled countdown power of ''Total Request'' into ''Total Request Live''. The program made its debut from MTV Studios on September 14, 1998. The show then grew to become MTV's unofficial [[flagship]] program.\n\nThe original host of ''TRL'', [[Carson Daly]], brought popularity to the show. The widely known abbreviation of ''TRL'' was adopted as the official title of the show in February 1999, after Daly and [[Dave Holmes (actor)|Dave Holmes]] began using the abbreviation on-air regularly. In the years following, the program was rarely referred to by its complete title. The show's countdown started off successfully while receiving hundreds of votes for Original Favorite Stars such as [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Eminem]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Korn]], [['N Sync]], and [[Backstreet Boys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7667301/mtvs-total-request-live-trl-the-real-story-memorable-moments|title=MTV's Total Request Live (TRL): The Real Story & Memorable Moments|date=August 8, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''TRL'' spent its first year developing a cult-type following.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/etc/trl.html|title=Inside Total Request Live - Merchants Of Cool - FRONTLINE - PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref> In the fall of 1999, a live studio audience was added to the show. By spring 2000, the countdown reached its peak, becoming a very recognizable pop culture icon in its first two years of existence. A weekend edition of the show known as ''TRL Weekend'', with a countdown consisting an average of the week's Top 10, aired for a short time in 2000.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 2001, the popularity of ''TRL'' was at such a level that it spawned a country music spin-off, ''[[CMT Most Wanted Live]]'', on sister network [[Country Music Television|CMT]], until 2004.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSome evolutionary changes were made to ''TRL'' throughout the next couple of years. The show received a new set and on-screen graphics for the debut of the fall 2001 season. A year later, on October 23, 2002, ''TRL'' celebrated its 1,000th episode. The number-one video on that day was \"[[Dirrty]]\" by [[Christina Aguilera]]. Also throughout the year of 2002, original host Carson Daly would be seen gradually less and less.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The show had near-daily segments from [[MTV News]] correspondents reporting on the latest in national or entertainment and music news from inside the studio.\n\n====Post-Carson Daly era====\nIn 2003, the next generation of ''TRL'' was ushered in as Carson Daly officially stepped down as host.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/carson-daly-looks-67039/|title=Carson Daly Looks Back as TRL Counts Down its Final Days|date=November 14, 2008|publisher=}}</ref> He left the show to host his own talk show, [[NBC]]'s ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'', which premiered a year earlier. Following Daly stepping down, a revolving door of VJs hosted ''TRL'', including [[Damien Fahey]], [[Hilarie Burton]], [[Vanessa Minnillo]], [[Quddus (MTV)|Quddus]], [[La La Vasquez]], and [[Susie Castillo]]. Some of these VJs made their debut on the show in earlier years, so they already had the opportunity to host the show on days in which Daly was not present.\n\nSome changes were made to ''TRL'''s voting process in 2005. The show previously allowed anyone to vote online multiple times, but as part of these changes, only registered members on MTV.com could vote online. Additionally, a limit of one vote per day was added. Then, on July 10, 2006, MTV announced that votes would no longer be taken by phone, ending the legacy of the \"DIAL MTV\" phone number, which had been in use for voting on MTV since the premiere of the countdown show ''[[Dial MTV]]'' in the mid-1980s.\n\n[[File:TRL studios in Times Square in 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''TRL'''s studios in Times Square in 2006.]]\n\nIn September 2006, ''TRL'' reached its eighth anniversary and, at that point, it was the longest-running live program that MTV had ever produced. It is also the third-longest-running program of all time in the network's history, following behind ''[[The Real World]]'', which has aired for the past 21 years, and ''[[120 Minutes]]'', which aired for 17 years. Around this time, ''TRL'' began airing officially on just four days a week (Monday through Thursday), as opposed to all five weekdays.\n\nOn November 2, 2006, ''TRL'' debuted what was billed as the first-ever [[hip hop]] [[public service announcement]] on [[global warming]]. The three-minute piece, titled \"Trees\", warned about deforestation and the dangers of global warming. The video corresponded with MTV's social campaign, ''Break the Addiction'', as part of ''think MTV''.\n\nThe hosts of ''TRL'' in 2008 were [[Damien Fahey]] and [[Lyndsey Rodrigues]]. Additionally, [[Stephen Colletti]], former cast member on ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]'', has appeared on ''TRL'' as host numerous times. The rest of the VJs are or have been working on separate projects. [[La La Vasquez]] went on to go work on her debut rap album {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. [[Hilarie Burton]] left ''TRL'' in 2004, after joining the cast of [[The WB]]/[[The CW|CW]]'s ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', playing [[Peyton Sawyer]]. Quddus hosted from 2001 to 2006. He left to move to California to be a host of ''[[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] Access''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/quddusphilippe|title=Quddus CV|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn May 22, 2007, ''TRL'' celebrated its 2000th episode, showing highlights from the past 2000 episodes, and a special countdown of ten of the most successful videos to ever appear on the show. [[Justin Timberlake]]'s \"[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]\" topped the special countdown.\n\n====The end of ''TRL''====\nIn 2007, rumors began circulating stating that the ratings-challenged music video countdown show was to be canceled. In early 2007, an average of 373,000 viewers regularly watched the program.<ref name=\"forbes\">{{cite web|last=Hau|first=Louis|title=R.I.P.

In February 2007, MTV said the rumor was unfounded and claimed ''TRL'' will continue to air for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe producers of ''TRL'' experimented with web-based viewer interaction throughout the 2006\u20132007 season, showing [[viral videos]], allowing viewers to send feedback on a video via [[internet forum]]s and [[webcams]], along with a heavy emphasis on MTV's since discontinued Overdrive video portal. However, MTV still secretly planned to cancel the show and replace one with even more emphasis on viewer interaction, named ''YouRL'' (a [[homophone]] of [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]].)<ref>{{cite news|last=Becker|first=Anne|title=MTV Favors 'YouRL' Swap for 'TRL'|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/mtv-favors-%E2%80%98yourl%E2%80%99-swap-%E2%80%98trl%E2%80%99/82534|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=April 30, 2007|accessdate=2015-01-27}}</ref>\n\nConsequently, in July 2007, it was reported that ''YouRL'' was not received well by test audiences and that the concept of YouRL has been abandoned for the time being.

The Rejects spent the entire episode assisting in the tear down of the set which was a theme for the episode.  At the end of the episode, Lindsey and Damien cooperatively added the last step in the demolition process by shutting down all the lights.  Preceding was a montage of cast and crew members saying their goodbyes by waving to the camera.\n\nA three-hour special marking the end of the show aired on November 16, 2008.<ref name=\"Report: MTV to Cancel TRL\"/> Several artists made appearances, including [[Ludacris]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Nelly]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[50 Cent]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Kid Rock]], [[JC Chasez]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Travis Barker]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Hilary Duff]], [[Eminem]], and [[Korn]]'s [[Jonathan Davis]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=November 11, 2008|title=Superstars Sign on For 'TRL' Finale|work=Billboard|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043531/superstars-sign-on-for-trl-finale|accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref> Former host Carson Daly described the media atmosphere after his departure from ''TRL'', in an interview with ''TV Guide'': \"MySpace was sold.

The program featured the return of a top ten countdown focusing on a specific playlist (Monday Motivation being the first countdown).<ref name=Andreeva2018/>\n\n2019 saw another retooling and name change as ''TRL Top 10'', which featured hosts Sway, Kevan Kenney and Jamila Mustafa. An off-shoot of the program, ''Fresh Out Fridays'', aired for several weeks on [[MTV2]] and covered everything new in music, pop culture, and fashion. TRL's ''Fresh Out Fridays'' aired a \"Playlist Of The Decade\" special on December 18, 2019 on [[MTV]], which covered the top 10 videos and pop culture moments of the 2010s. TRL has yet to return in 2020, but Fresh Out Fridays returned on February 7, 2020 on [[MTV]] as Fresh Out Live. Unlike its half-hour [[MTV2]] predecessor, Fresh Out Live has a runtime of around eight minutes. Starting Saturday, February 8, 2020, [[MTV]] airs a weekly one-hour block of music videos at 8AM ET under the name Fresh Out Playlist. This is the only block of long-form music videos [[MTV]] plays on its flagship channel.\n[[File:Trl-am-logo.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''Total Request AM'' logo]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Impact==\n{{fansite|section|date=December 2018}}\n''TRL'' is widely viewed as the show that launched the careers of many artists from the late 1990s and early 2000s. The show was featured as a main plot point in the movie ''[[Drake & Josh Go Hollywood]]'', produced by sister network [[Nickelodeon]].\n\n===Boy bands===\nEven though clean-cut [[boy band]]s like [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[NSYNC]] reached success before ''TRL'' began in the fall of 1998, both groups only reached their commercial peaks after their videos were seen on ''TRL''. In 1999, the Backstreet Boys' second LP, ''[[Millennium (Backstreet Boys album)|Millennium]]'', achieved the highest first week sales ever from an LP at the time.\n\nNSYNC also appeared on ''TRL'' in 2000, when their second LP, ''[[No Strings Attached ('N Sync album)|No Strings Attached]]'', topped the Backstreet Boys' first week sales. Once again, the large number of fans in attendance closed down the streets of Times Square. Throughout most of 1998, 1999, and 2000, videos by the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC would claim the top position on the countdown.\n\n===Pop princesses===\nPop singers like [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Jessica Simpson]] all made their music debuts on ''TRL'' as well. Britney and Christina became regulars on the show and would often appear as a guest. Simpson would not enjoy the same type of success until two years later, when she released the \"[[Irresistible (Jessica Simpson song)|Irresistible]]\" video, which reached number two on the countdown. [[Mandy Moore]] saw success on the show with her debut single's \"[[Candy (Mandy Moore song)|Candy]]\" in 1999 and \"[[I Wanna Be with You (Mandy Moore song)|I Wanna Be with You]]\", but did not score her first number-one video until her 2002 single \"[[Crush (Mandy Moore song)|Crush]]\" which she also performed on the show.\n\n[[Jessica Simpson]]'s younger sister [[Ashlee Simpson]] is another pop princess that has had some success on ''TRL'' with her first music video \"[[Pieces of Me (song)|Pieces of Me]]\" in 2004. Ashlee Simpson had three videos in the number one and one close to retirement. She would go on to score a number of number one videos on the show.\n\nThe artist with the most retirees videos is pop princess [[Britney Spears]] with 13 videos retired, an honorary retired video (\"[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]\") and three videos retired number one.\n\nA pop princess streak occurred in March 2007: The number one and number two spots were women for every show. There was no other month in the history of ''TRL'' where every show had a woman at the top spot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popfusion.net/forums/showthread.php?t=43280|title=ATRL \u2013 TRL Recap (March & April 2007)<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/ |title=The TRL Archive \u2013 Recap, records, and statistics for MTV's Total Request Live |publisher=ATRL |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Rock bands===\nAlthough best known for featuring pop acts, ''TRL'' regularly featured videos and performances from rock bands in genres such as [[nu metal]], [[pop punk]] and [[emo pop]].

Started on [[MTV Italy]] on November 2, 1999, it was hosted by [[Marco Maccarini]] and [[Giorgia Surina]], followed by Federico Russo and Carolina Di Domenico. Since the 2005\u201306 season, Surina returned to ''TRL'' with a new co-host, [[Alessandro Cattelan]]. After the 2005\u201306 season, the show was hosted only by Alessandro Cattelan. For the season 2007\u201308 the show was hosted for the first moment by [[Alessandro Cattelan]] and Elena Santarelli, and for the summer the male host was replaced by Carlo Pastore. Later Carlo Pastore was still the main host, but the female host changed to [[Elisabetta Canalis]]. Throughout its 8 seasons, ''TRL'' was broadcast from [[Milan]], Rome, [[Venice]], [[Naples]], [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]]. ''TRL Italy'' is the longest-running show on MTV Italy: on December 23, 2004, a special two-hour event, \"TRL #1000\", was aired to celebrate the program's 1000th episode. From 2006 to 2012, there was also a program called ''[[TRL Awards (Italy)|TRL Awards]]'' where the people choose the artist of the year via web or mobile, and in summer 2007 was aired a special weekly-appointement called ''TRL Extra Live'', who famous Italian singers did a mini-concert. The last version of the program was hosted by Brenda Lodigiani, Alessandro Arcodia, Wintana Rezene and Andrea Cadioli, under the name ''TRL on the Road'', and ended on September 24, 2010.\n[[File:Trltitlescreen.jpg|thumb|upright|''TRL'' logo used in Italy.]]\n* [[MTV Rom\u00e2nia]] launched the Romanian version of ''TRL'' from an [[Orange Rom\u00e2nia|Orange]] concept store on [[Calea Victoriei]] (a major commercial avenue in the center of [[Bucharest]]) on January 23, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.ro/trl|title=MTV.ro|website=MTV.ro|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415152935/http://www.mtv.ro/trl/|archivedate=April 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The show aired two times a week, on Tuesday and Wednesday. The graphic was similar to that of the Italian version. The show has closed during 2009.\n* The British version, known as ''[[TRL UK]]'', was hosted by [[Dave Berry (presenter)|Dave Berry]], [[Alex Zane]], [[Jo Good]], and Maxine Akhtar. It was broadcast live from [[Viacom International Media Networks (Europe)|MTV Networks Europe]] Studios in [[Camden, London]], then moving to [[Leicester Square]] in London from second series. Following the second series' broadcast from Leicester Square, the top 10 countdown was removed from the show. The second series finished at the end of 2005 and the show never returned to air.\n* The Australian version of ''TRL'' began as a weekend show, but then began aired live Monday through Friday. It was hosted by Maz Compton, Lyndsey Rodrigues, Nathan Sapsford, and Jason Robert Dundas. In early 2006, it returned to airing only on Friday evenings. The show was cancelled at the end of 2006 and was replaced by \"The Lair\". A revival of ''TRL'' returned in 2019. It is hosted by Ash London, Angus O'Loughlin, Flex Mami, and Lisa Hamilton.\n* After a Polish version of ''TRL'' was unsuccessful, [[MTV Poland]] decided to launch a new chart show based on ''TRL''{{'}}s structure titled ''RMF MAXXX Hits'', which aired from Monday to Saturday at 2 p.m.\n* [[MTV France]] has launched the French version ({{lang|fr|Ton Request Live}}) of the American show on January 24, 2007. The format was different from the original concept: there wasn't the countdown with the 10 favourite videos and in every episode there was a movie's mini-documentaries entitled \"{{lang|fr|TRL en Movies}}\". The show closed after only an episode on January 25, 2007 and it has cancelled from the schedule of [[MTV France]].\n* The German version of ''TRL'' was very successful throughout Europe (after Italy), and it was known as ''Total Request Live Germany''. ''TRL Germany'' had the highest television ratings of all the ''TRL'' versions in Europe. The show was hosted by Joko Winterscheidt and [[Mirjam Weichselbraun]] or Patrice Bou\u00e9dib\u00e9la from Tuesday to Friday from 4:30 to 5:30&nbsp;pm, and it was divided in four versions: ''Urban TRL'' (hip hop music), ''Rock TRL'' (rock music), regular ''TRL'' (various genres), and ''TRL XXL'' (special live guest). It was replaced with ''MTV Home'' in summer 2009.\n* In Brazil, MTV aired a show similar to ''TRL'' known as ''[[Disk MTV]]''. This program was created before ''TRL'', existing since the launch of [[MTV Brasil]] in 1990, and has never changed its format as a top ten request show over the years. It aired weekdays from 6:00 to 7:00&nbsp;pm. On December 29, 2006, MTV Brasil aired the last ''Disk MTV'' episode. It had a week-long special about the best videos of its sixteen-year run; the last video shown in the program was [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\". The show was cut due to the decision of network of not airing music videos on its 2007 schedule, claiming that videos are something that can be viewed online on their [[MTV Overdrive|Overdrive]] website.\n\n===Similar programs===\n* In Latin America, a version of ''TRL'' called ''[[Los 10+ Pedidos]]'' (''The 10 Most Requested'') airs daily. The show is hosted by \"Gabo\" and \"Macarena\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvla.com/tv/los10/|title=TRL Latin America|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122014341/http://www.mtvla.com/tv/los10/|archivedate=November 22, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[MTV Tr3s]], a US channel targeted to bilingual [[Hispanic]] people, launched ''Mi TRL'' in September 2006. The show carried the same format and graphics as the English version of ''TRL''. ''Mi TRL'' was initially anchored by [[Carlos Santos (MTV Tr3\u0301s)|Carlos Santos]] and [[Susie Castillo]]. Since then, Castillo has been with another VJ, Denise Ramerez. [[MTV News]] segments on the show are delivered from Los Angeles by correspondent [[Liz Hernandez]].\n* Sister network [[BET]] featured its own hip-hop and rap-focused countdown, ''[[106 & Park]]'', and the two shows frequently competed with one another for guests, though by the end of the run of ''TRL'', both shows aired with some space between them, allowing guests to appear on both shows on the same day.\n* [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]] featured a version of ''TRL'' called ''[[Jack's Big Music Show]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[TRL's Number Ones]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |title=Total Request Live: The Ultimate Fan Guide |publisher=Simon and Schuster |last=Jackman |first=Ian |year=2000 |isbn=9780743418508 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/trlultimatefangu00jack_0 }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0167735}}\n* {{tv.com show|trl}}\n\n{{MTV Networks}}\n{{Music based programs on MTV}}\n{{MTVNetwork Shows}}\n{{Teen Choice Award for Choice TV \u2013 Reality Series}}\n\n[[Category:1998 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:2017 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1990s American music television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American music television series]]\n[[Category:2010s American music television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American music television series]]\n[[Category:American music chart television programs]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:MTV original programming]]\n[[Category:Music chart shows]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{tone|date=May 2017}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2020}}\n{{fansite|date=January 2020}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2015}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Total Request Live\n| image                    = Trl-top-ten-logo.jpg\n| show_name_2              = TRL\n| creator                  = \n| presenter                = <small>'''Original:'''</small><br />[[Carson Daly]]<br>[[Dave_Holmes_(actor)|Dave Holmes]]<br>[[Jesse Camp]]<br>[[Damien Fahey]]<br>[[Hilarie Burton]]<br>[[Vanessa Lachey|Vanessa Minnillo]]<br>[[Quddus (television personality)|Quddus]]<br>[[La La Anthony|La La Vasquez]]<br>[[Susie Castillo]]<br>[[Lyndsey Rodrigues]]<br><small>'''Revival:'''</small><br />[[DC Young Fly]]<br>Tamara Dhia<br>Amy Pham<br>Erik Zachary<br>Lawrence Jackson<br>Matt Rife<br><small>'''2018 retooling:'''</small><br>[[Sway Calloway|Sway]]<br>\n<small>'''2019 retooling:'''</small><br>Sway<br>Jamila Mustafa<br>Kevan Kenney\n| country                  = United States\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = 20\n| num_episodes             = 2,254\n| runtime                  = 45\u201348 minutes (formerly)<br>20\u201323 minutes (final episodes)\n| network                  = [[MTV]]\n| first_aired              = <small>'''Original:'''</small><br />{{Start date|1998|9|14}} \u2013<br />{{End date|2008|11|16}}<br> <small>'''Revival:'''</small><br />{{Start date|2017|10|2}}\n| last_aired = present\n| website                  = http://trltop10.mtv.com/\n| image_alt                = \n| caption                  = \n| list_episodes            = \n| channel                  = \n| first_run                = \n| released                 = \n}}\n\n'''''Total Request Live''''' (known commonly as '''''TRL''''') is an American television program broadcast on [[MTV]] that premiered on September 14, 1998. The series features popular [[Music video|music videos]] played during its countdown, and was also used as a promotion tool by musicians, actors, and other [[celebrity|celebrities]] to promote their newest works to the show's target [[Teen culture|teen]] [[demographics|demographic]].\n\nDuring the original run of the program, ''TRL'' played the ten most [[Request (broadcasting)|requested]] music videos of the day, as voted by viewers via phone or online. The show generally aired Monday through Thursday for one hour, though the scheduling and length of the show fluctuated over the years. Although ''TRL'' was billed as a live show, many episodes were actually pre-recorded. Due to declining ratings, and the larger secular decline of music-based television in favor of online services, MTV would announce the cancellation of ''TRL'' on  September 15, 2008.<ref name=\"Report: MTV to Cancel TRL\">{{cite news|title=Report: MTV to Cancel TRL|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6596363.html|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> The special three-hour finale episode, ''Total Finale Live'', aired on November 16, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1597023/20081014/knowles_beyonce.jhtml|title=Beyonce To Perform On 'TRL' Finale|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nLess than a decade later, ''TRL'' would be revived on October 2, 2017.<ref name=\"MTV Mines the Past\">{{cite web|last1=Koblin|first1=John|title=MTV Mines the Past for Its Future: \u2018Total Request Live\u2019|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/business/media/mtv-total-request-live-revival.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> In 2019, the show aired Saturday mornings at 10am EST as ''TRL Top 10''.\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\n''Total Request Live'' originated from several pre-existing programs on [[MTV]]. ''[[Dial MTV]]'', the first video request show on the network, had aired from 1986 to 1996. In 1997, MTV launched two new shows that became the predecessors of ''TRL'': ''[[Total Request]]'', a revival of the ''Dial MTV'' concept hosted by [[Carson Daly]], and ''[[MTV Live (U.S. TV program)|MTV Live]]'', which was hosted by [[Toby Amies]] and featured live performances and interviews from musical artists.\n\n{{MTV}}\n''Total Request'' was more subdued than ''MTV Live'', as Daly introduced music videos from an empty, dimly lit set. As the show progressed and gained more momentum with viewers tuning in, it was soon added to the list of daytime programming during MTV's ''Summer Share'' in [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]]. The countdown would prove to be one of the most watched and most interactive shows in recent MTV history, demonstrating that it had potential to become an even larger success by combining with the element of live television.\n\n===Original Run (1998-2008)===\n====Carson Daly era ====\nIn Fall 1998, MTV producers merged the real-time aspect of ''MTV Live'' with the fan-controlled countdown power of ''Total Request'' into ''Total Request Live''. The program made its debut from MTV Studios on September 14, 1998. The show then grew to become MTV's unofficial [[flagship]] program.\n\nThe original host of ''TRL'', [[Carson Daly]], brought popularity to the show. The widely known abbreviation of ''TRL'' was adopted as the official title of the show in February 1999, after Daly and [[Dave Holmes (actor)|Dave Holmes]] began using the abbreviation on-air regularly. In the years following, the program was rarely referred to by its complete title. The show's countdown started off successfully while receiving hundreds of votes for Original Favorite Stars such as [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Eminem]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Korn]], [['N Sync]], and [[Backstreet Boys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7667301/mtvs-total-request-live-trl-the-real-story-memorable-moments|title=MTV's Total Request Live (TRL): The Real Story & Memorable Moments|date=August 8, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''TRL'' spent its first year developing a cult-type following.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/etc/trl.html|title=Inside Total Request Live - Merchants Of Cool - FRONTLINE - PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref> In the fall of 1999, a live studio audience was added to the show. By spring 2000, the countdown reached its peak, becoming a very recognizable pop culture icon in its first two years of existence. A weekend edition of the show known as ''TRL Weekend'', with a countdown consisting an average of the week's Top 10, aired for a short time in 2000.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 2001, the popularity of ''TRL'' was at such a level that it spawned a country music spin-off, ''[[CMT Most Wanted Live]]'', on sister network [[Country Music Television|CMT]], until 2004.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSome evolutionary changes were made to ''TRL'' throughout the next couple of years. The show received a new set and on-screen graphics for the debut of the fall 2001 season. A year later, on October 23, 2002, ''TRL'' celebrated its 1,000th episode. The number-one video on that day was \"[[Dirrty]]\" by [[Christina Aguilera]]. Also throughout the year of 2002, original host Carson Daly would be seen gradually less and less.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The show had near-daily segments from [[MTV News]] correspondents reporting on the latest in national or entertainment and music news from inside the studio.\n\n====Post-Carson Daly era====\nIn 2003, the next generation of ''TRL'' was ushered in as Carson Daly officially stepped down as host.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/carson-daly-looks-67039/|title=Carson Daly Looks Back as TRL Counts Down its Final Days|date=November 14, 2008|publisher=}}</ref> He left the show to host his own talk show, [[NBC]]'s ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'', which premiered a year earlier. Following Daly stepping down, a revolving door of VJs hosted ''TRL'', including [[Damien Fahey]], [[Hilarie Burton]], [[Vanessa Minnillo]], [[Quddus (MTV)|Quddus]], [[La La Vasquez]], and [[Susie Castillo]]. Some of these VJs made their debut on the show in earlier years, so they already had the opportunity to host the show on days in which Daly was not present.\n\nSome changes were made to ''TRL'''s voting process in 2005. The show previously allowed anyone to vote online multiple times, but as part of these changes, only registered members on MTV.com could vote online. Additionally, a limit of one vote per day was added. Then, on July 10, 2006, MTV announced that votes would no longer be taken by phone, ending the legacy of the \"DIAL MTV\" phone number, which had been in use for voting on MTV since the premiere of the countdown show ''[[Dial MTV]]'' in the mid-1980s.\n\n[[File:TRL studios in Times Square in 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''TRL'''s studios in Times Square in 2006.]]\n\nIn September 2006, ''TRL'' reached its eighth anniversary and, at that point, it was the longest-running live program that MTV had ever produced. It is also the third-longest-running program of all time in the network's history, following behind ''[[The Real World]]'', which has aired for the past 21 years, and ''[[120 Minutes]]'', which aired for 17 years. Around this time, ''TRL'' began airing officially on just four days a week (Monday through Thursday), as opposed to all five weekdays.\n\nOn November 2, 2006, ''TRL'' debuted what was billed as the first-ever [[hip hop]] [[public service announcement]] on [[global warming]]. The three-minute piece, titled \"Trees\", warned about deforestation and the dangers of global warming. The video corresponded with MTV's social campaign, ''Break the Addiction'', as part of ''think MTV''.\n\nThe hosts of ''TRL'' in 2008 were [[Damien Fahey]] and [[Lyndsey Rodrigues]]. Additionally, [[Stephen Colletti]], former cast member on ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]'', has appeared on ''TRL'' as host numerous times. The rest of the VJs are or have been working on separate projects. [[La La Vasquez]] went on to go work on her debut rap album {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. [[Hilarie Burton]] left ''TRL'' in 2004, after joining the cast of [[The WB]]/[[The CW|CW]]'s ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', playing [[Peyton Sawyer]]. Quddus hosted from 2001 to 2006. He left to move to California to be a host of ''[[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] Access''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/quddusphilippe|title=Quddus CV|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn May 22, 2007, ''TRL'' celebrated its 2000th episode, showing highlights from the past 2000 episodes, and a special countdown of ten of the most successful videos to ever appear on the show. [[Justin Timberlake]]'s \"[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]\" topped the special countdown.\n\n====The end of ''TRL''====\nIn 2007, rumors began circulating stating that the ratings-challenged music video countdown show was to be canceled. In early 2007, an average of 373,000 viewers regularly watched the program.<ref name=\"forbes\">{{cite web|last=Hau|first=Louis|title=R.I.P.

The Rejects spent the entire episode assisting in the tear down of the set which was a theme for the episode.  At the end of the episode, Lindsey and Damien cooperatively added the last step in the demolition process by shutting down all the lights.

The show airs Monday and Tuesday at 11 PM. MTV announced plans to expand the show to three nights in the summer and four nights by the end of the year, but this never materialized.<ref name=Andreeva2018>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/04/trl-a-m-premiere-date-afternoon-show-return-delayed-april-1202359407/|title=\u2018TRL\u2019 Morning Edition\u2019s Launch Moved Up To April & Aligned With Afternoon Block Whose Return Is Delayed By 2 Weeks|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn April 23, 2018, MTV launched a pre-recorded, hour-long daily morning edition of ''TRL'' titled ''Total Request AM''. The show aired at 8am and was hosted by [[Sway Calloway|Sway]]. [[Vinny Guadagnino|Vinny]] from ''Jersey Shore'' was brought on as host for the week and the first guests were boy band [[PrettyMuch]]. The program featured the return of a top ten countdown focusing on a specific playlist (Monday Motivation being the first countdown).<ref name=Andreeva2018/>\n\n2019 saw another retooling and name change as ''TRL Top 10'', which featured hosts Sway, Kevan Kenney and Jamila Mustafa. An off-shoot of the program, ''Fresh Out Fridays'', aired for several weeks on [[MTV2]] and covered everything new in music, pop culture, and fashion. TRL's ''Fresh Out Fridays'' aired a \"Playlist Of The Decade\" special on December 18, 2019 on [[MTV]], which covered the top 10 videos and pop culture moments of the 2010s. TRL has yet to return in 2020, but Fresh Out Fridays returned on February 7, 2020 on [[MTV]] as Fresh Out Live. Unlike its half-hour [[MTV2]] predecessor, Fresh Out Live has a runtime of around eight minutes. Starting Saturday, February 8, 2020, [[MTV]] airs a weekly one-hour block of music videos at 8AM ET under the name Fresh Out Playlist. This is the only block of long-form music videos [[MTV]] plays on its flagship channel.\n[[File:Trl-am-logo.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''Total Request AM'' logo]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Impact==\n{{fansite|section|date=December 2018}}\n''TRL'' is widely viewed as the show that launched the careers of many artists from the late 1990s and early 2000s. The show was featured as a main plot point in the movie ''[[Drake & Josh Go Hollywood]]'', produced by sister network [[Nickelodeon]].\n\n===Boy bands===\nEven though clean-cut [[boy band]]s like [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[NSYNC]] reached success before ''TRL'' began in the fall of 1998, both groups only reached their commercial peaks after their videos were seen on ''TRL''. In 1999, the Backstreet Boys' second LP, ''[[Millennium (Backstreet Boys album)|Millennium]]'', achieved the highest first week sales ever from an LP at the time.\n\nNSYNC also appeared on ''TRL'' in 2000, when their second LP, ''[[No Strings Attached ('N Sync album)|No Strings Attached]]'', topped the Backstreet Boys' first week sales. Once again, the large number of fans in attendance closed down the streets of Times Square. Throughout most of 1998, 1999, and 2000, videos by the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC would claim the top position on the countdown.\n\n===Pop princesses===\nPop singers like [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Jessica Simpson]] all made their music debuts on ''TRL'' as well. Britney and Christina became regulars on the show and would often appear as a guest. Simpson would not enjoy the same type of success until two years later, when she released the \"[[Irresistible (Jessica Simpson song)|Irresistible]]\" video, which reached number two on the countdown. [[Mandy Moore]] saw success on the show with her debut single's \"[[Candy (Mandy Moore song)|Candy]]\" in 1999 and \"[[I Wanna Be with You (Mandy Moore song)|I Wanna Be with You]]\", but did not score her first number-one video until her 2002 single \"[[Crush (Mandy Moore song)|Crush]]\" which she also performed on the show.\n\n[[Jessica Simpson]]'s younger sister [[Ashlee Simpson]] is another pop princess that has had some success on ''TRL'' with her first music video \"[[Pieces of Me (song)|Pieces of Me]]\" in 2004. Ashlee Simpson had three videos in the number one and one close to retirement. She would go on to score a number of number one videos on the show.\n\nThe artist with the most retirees videos is pop princess [[Britney Spears]] with 13 videos retired, an honorary retired video (\"[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]\") and three videos retired number one.\n\nA pop princess streak occurred in March 2007: The number one and number two spots were women for every show. There was no other month in the history of ''TRL'' where every show had a woman at the top spot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popfusion.net/forums/showthread.php?t=43280|title=ATRL \u2013 TRL Recap (March & April 2007)<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/ |title=The TRL Archive \u2013 Recap, records, and statistics for MTV's Total Request Live |publisher=ATRL |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Rock bands===\nAlthough best known for featuring pop acts, ''TRL'' regularly featured videos and performances from rock bands in genres such as [[nu metal]], [[pop punk]] and [[emo pop]]. The metal bands [[Korn]] and [[Limp Bizkit]] were particularly popular on the program in the late 1990s, and often shared airtime with [[Britney Spears]] and the [[Backstreet Boys]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Pop Vs.

The [[Jonas Brothers]] have had their songs \"[[Hold On (Jonas Brothers song)|Hold On]]\", and \"[[SOS (Jonas Brothers song)|SOS]]\" premiere; \"SOS\" made it on the countdown peaking at number six. \"[[When You Look Me in the Eyes]]\" was on the charts for several weeks before peaking at number one, after fans crushed and flooded the ''TRL'' site by requesting hundreds of times on March 19, 2008. \"[[Burnin' Up (Jonas Brothers song)|Burnin' Up]]\" has also made it to the number-one spot on ''TRL''. [[Ashley Tisdale]] premiered \"[[He Said She Said (song)|He Said She Said]]\" on ''TRL'' and it reached the number-one spot for sixteen days and these was retrieved at forty days in the countdown, becoming the most successful song for a Disney recording artist in the show. [[Aly & AJ]]'s videos for \"[[Rush (Aly & AJ song)|Rush]]\", \"[[Chemicals React]]\" and \"[[Potential Breakup Song]]\" have all been on the countdown with \"Rush\" peaking at number two and \"Chemicals React\" peaking at number four, and \"Potential Breakup Song\" peaking at number five. [[Miley Cyrus]]'s \"[[7 Things]]\" premiered on ''TRL'' and reached number four on the show.\n\n==Video game==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 53.89%<ref name=GR>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/533011-mtv-total-request-live-trivia/index.html |title=MTV Total Request Live Trivia for PC |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n| MC = 48/100<ref name=MC>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mtv-total-request-live-trivia |title=MTV Total Request Live Trivia for PC Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n| Allgame = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=35742&tab=review |title=MTV TRL Trivia \u2013 Review |last=Miller |first=Eden |publisher=[[AllGame]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116051011/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=35742&tab=review |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 4.1/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mtv-total-request-live-trivia-review/1900-2805968/ |title=MTV Total Request Live Trivia Review |last=Goble |first=Gord |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=August 20, 2001 |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n| GameZone = 6.5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r18828.htm |title=MTV Total Request Live Trivia Review \u2013 PC |author=The Badger |publisher=GameZone |date=August 15, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718060618/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r18828.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2007 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2014-11-25}}</ref>\n| IGN = 5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/13/trl-trivia |title=TRL Trivia |last=Morrissey |first=Mike |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=August 13, 2001 |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n| PCGUS = 50%<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://pcgamer.com/reviews/review_2002-01-02a.html |title=MTV Total Request Live <nowiki>[Trivia]</nowiki> |last=Barnstone |first=Trina |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |date=November 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020216201201/http://pcgamer.com/reviews/review_2002-01-02a.html |archivedate=February 16, 2002 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n}}\n\nA PC video game called '''''MTV Total Request Live Trivia''''' was developed by [[Hypnotix]] and published by [[Take-Two Interactive]], with a release on August 14, 2001.

Started on [[MTV Italy]] on November 2, 1999, it was hosted by [[Marco Maccarini]] and [[Giorgia Surina]], followed by Federico Russo and Carolina Di Domenico. Since the 2005\u201306 season, Surina returned to ''TRL'' with a new co-host, [[Alessandro Cattelan]]. After the 2005\u201306 season, the show was hosted only by Alessandro Cattelan. For the season 2007\u201308 the show was hosted for the first moment by [[Alessandro Cattelan]] and Elena Santarelli, and for the summer the male host was replaced by Carlo Pastore. Later Carlo Pastore was still the main host, but the female host changed to [[Elisabetta Canalis]]. Throughout its 8 seasons, ''TRL'' was broadcast from [[Milan]], Rome, [[Venice]], [[Naples]], [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]]. ''TRL Italy'' is the longest-running show on MTV Italy: on December 23, 2004, a special two-hour event, \"TRL #1000\", was aired to celebrate the program's 1000th episode. From 2006 to 2012, there was also a program called ''[[TRL Awards (Italy)|TRL Awards]]'' where the people choose the artist of the year via web or mobile, and in summer 2007 was aired a special weekly-appointement called ''TRL Extra Live'', who famous Italian singers did a mini-concert. The last version of the program was hosted by Brenda Lodigiani, Alessandro Arcodia, Wintana Rezene and Andrea Cadioli, under the name ''TRL on the Road'', and ended on September 24, 2010.\n[[File:Trltitlescreen.jpg|thumb|upright|''TRL'' logo used in Italy.]]\n* [[MTV Rom\u00e2nia]] launched the Romanian version of ''TRL'' from an [[Orange Rom\u00e2nia|Orange]] concept store on [[Calea Victoriei]] (a major commercial avenue in the center of [[Bucharest]]) on January 23, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.ro/trl|title=MTV.ro|website=MTV.ro|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415152935/http://www.mtv.ro/trl/|archivedate=April 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The show aired two times a week, on Tuesday and Wednesday. The graphic was similar to that of the Italian version. The show has closed during 2009.\n* The British version, known as ''[[TRL UK]]'', was hosted by [[Dave Berry (presenter)|Dave Berry]], [[Alex Zane]], [[Jo Good]], and Maxine Akhtar. It was broadcast live from [[Viacom International Media Networks (Europe)|MTV Networks Europe]] Studios in [[Camden, London]], then moving to [[Leicester Square]] in London from second series. Following the second series' broadcast from Leicester Square, the top 10 countdown was removed from the show. The second series finished at the end of 2005 and the show never returned to air.\n* The Australian version of ''TRL'' began as a weekend show, but then began aired live Monday through Friday. It was hosted by Maz Compton, Lyndsey Rodrigues, Nathan Sapsford, and Jason Robert Dundas. In early 2006, it returned to airing only on Friday evenings. The show was cancelled at the end of 2006 and was replaced by \"The Lair\". A revival of ''TRL'' returned in 2019. It is hosted by Ash London, Angus O'Loughlin, Flex Mami, and Lisa Hamilton.\n* After a Polish version of ''TRL'' was unsuccessful, [[MTV Poland]] decided to launch a new chart show based on ''TRL''{{'}}s structure titled ''RMF MAXXX Hits'', which aired from Monday to Saturday at 2 p.m.\n* [[MTV France]] has launched the French version ({{lang|fr|Ton Request Live}}) of the American show on January 24, 2007. The format was different from the original concept: there wasn't the countdown with the 10 favourite videos and in every episode there was a movie's mini-documentaries entitled \"{{lang|fr|TRL en Movies}}\". The show closed after only an episode on January 25, 2007 and it has cancelled from the schedule of [[MTV France]].\n* The German version of ''TRL'' was very successful throughout Europe (after Italy), and it was known as ''Total Request Live Germany''. ''TRL Germany'' had the highest television ratings of all the ''TRL'' versions in Europe. The show was hosted by Joko Winterscheidt and [[Mirjam Weichselbraun]] or Patrice Bou\u00e9dib\u00e9la from Tuesday to Friday from 4:30 to 5:30&nbsp;pm, and it was divided in four versions: ''Urban TRL'' (hip hop music), ''Rock TRL'' (rock music), regular ''TRL'' (various genres), and ''TRL XXL'' (special live guest). It was replaced with ''MTV Home'' in summer 2009.\n* In Brazil, MTV aired a show similar to ''TRL'' known as ''[[Disk MTV]]''. This program was created before ''TRL'', existing since the launch of [[MTV Brasil]] in 1990, and has never changed its format as a top ten request show over the years. It aired weekdays from 6:00 to 7:00&nbsp;pm. On December 29, 2006, MTV Brasil aired the last ''Disk MTV'' episode. It had a week-long special about the best videos of its sixteen-year run; the last video shown in the program was [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\". The show was cut due to the decision of network of not airing music videos on its 2007 schedule, claiming that videos are something that can be viewed online on their [[MTV Overdrive|Overdrive]] website.\n\n===Similar programs===\n* In Latin America, a version of ''TRL'' called ''[[Los 10+ Pedidos]]'' (''The 10 Most Requested'') airs daily. The show is hosted by \"Gabo\" and \"Macarena\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvla.com/tv/los10/|title=TRL Latin America|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122014341/http://www.mtvla.com/tv/los10/|archivedate=November 22, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[MTV Tr3s]], a US channel targeted to bilingual [[Hispanic]] people, launched ''Mi TRL'' in September 2006. The show carried the same format and graphics as the English version of ''TRL''. ''Mi TRL'' was initially anchored by [[Carlos Santos (MTV Tr3\u0301s)|Carlos Santos]] and [[Susie Castillo]]. Since then, Castillo has been with another VJ, Denise Ramerez. [[MTV News]] segments on the show are delivered from Los Angeles by correspondent [[Liz Hernandez]].\n* Sister network [[BET]] featured its own hip-hop and rap-focused countdown, ''[[106 & Park]]'', and the two shows frequently competed with one another for guests, though by the end of the run of ''TRL'', both shows aired with some space between them, allowing guests to appear on both shows on the same day.\n* [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]] featured a version of ''TRL'' called ''[[Jack's Big Music Show]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[TRL's Number Ones]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |title=Total Request Live: The Ultimate Fan Guide |publisher=Simon and Schuster |last=Jackman |first=Ian |year=2000 |isbn=9780743418508 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/trlultimatefangu00jack_0 }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0167735}}\n* {{tv.com show|trl}}\n\n{{MTV Networks}}\n{{Music based programs on MTV}}\n{{MTVNetwork Shows}}\n{{Teen Choice Award for Choice TV \u2013 Reality Series}}\n\n[[Category:1998 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:2017 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1990s American music television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American music television series]]\n[[Category:2010s American music television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American music television series]]\n[[Category:American music chart television programs]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:MTV original programming]]\n[[Category:Music chart shows]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n", "name_user": "Nplcoach", "label": "safe", "comment": "corrected time code (ET, not EST)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Request_Live"}
