Wolf criticized the fashion and beauty industries as exploitative of women, but added that the beauty myth extended into all areas of human functioning. Wolf writes that women should have \"the choice to do whatever we want with our faces and bodies without being punished by an ideology that is using attitudes, economic pressure, and even legal judgments regarding women's appearance to undermine us psychologically and politically\". Wolf argues that women were under assault by the \"beauty myth\" in five areas: work, religion, sex, violence, and hunger. Ultimately, Wolf argues for a relaxation of normative standards of beauty.<ref>''The Beauty Myth'', pp. 17\u201318, 20, 86, 131, 179, 218.</ref> In her introduction, Wolf positioned her argument against the concerns of second-wave feminists and offered the following analysis:\n\n{{quote|The more legal and material hindrances women have broken through, the more strictly and heavily and cruelly images of female beauty have come to weigh upon us ... [D]uring the past decade, women breached the power structure; meanwhile, [[eating disorder]]s rose exponentially and cosmetic surgery became the fastest-growing specialty ...

She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a \"victim\", but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote,\n\n<blockquote>I began, nearly a year ago, to try\u2014privately\u2014to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive. After nine months and many calls and e-mails, I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact\u2014as secretive as a Masonic lodge.<ref name=\"WolfNYM2004\">{{cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Naomi|title=The Silent Treatment|journal=New York |date=March 1, 2004|url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/ |access-date=May 19, 2010}}</ref>  Sexual encroachment in an educational context or a workplace is, most seriously, a corruption of meritocracy; it is in this sense parallel to bribery. I was not traumatized personally, but my educational experience was corrupted. If we rephrase sexual transgression in school and work as a civil-rights and civil-society issue, everything becomes less emotional, less personal. If we see this as a systemic corruption issue, then when people bring allegations, the focus will be on whether the institution has been damaged in its larger mission.<ref name=\"WolfNYM2004\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine around the time the allegations against Bloom first surfaced, [[Meghan O'Rourke]] wrote that Wolf generalized about sexual assault at Yale on the basis of her alleged personal experience. Moreover, O'Rourke commented, that despite Wolf's assertion sexual assault existed at Yale, she did not interview any Yale students for her story. In addition, O'Rourke wrote, \"She jumps through verbal hoops to make it clear she was not 'personally traumatized,' yet she spends paragraphs describing the incident in precisely those terms.\" O'Rourke wrote that, despite Wolf's claim that her educational experience was corrupted, \"(s)he neglects to mention that she later was awarded a [[Rhodes scholarship|Rhodes]] (scholarship).\" O'Rourke concluded Wolf's \"gaps and imprecision\" in the ''New York'' article \"give fodder to skeptics who think sexual harassment charges are often just a form of hysteria.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Rourke|first=Meghan|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2004/02/crying_wolf.html|title=Crying Wolf|work=Slate|date=February 25, 2004|access-date=January 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeparately, a formal complaint was filed with the [[U.S. Department of Education]] [[Office for Civil Rights]] on March 15, 2011, by 16 current and former Yale students\u201412 female and 4 male\u2014describing a sexually hostile environment at Yale.

In ''[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town & Country]]'' magazine in January 2018, Vanamee returned to the story and wrote, \"Yale University has a 93-person police department, and, after the guard called

Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote,\n\n<blockquote>I began, nearly a year ago, to try\u2014privately\u2014to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring.

I was not traumatized personally, but my educational experience was corrupted.

In addition, O'Rourke wrote, \"She jumps through verbal hoops to make it clear she was not 'personally traumatized,' yet she spends paragraphs describing the incident in precisely those terms.\" O'Rourke wrote that, despite Wolf's claim that her educational experience was corrupted, \"(s)he neglects to mention that she later was awarded a [[Rhodes scholarship|Rhodes]] (scholarship).\" O'Rourke concluded Wolf's \"gaps and imprecision\" in the ''New York'' article \"give fodder to skeptics who think sexual harassment charges are often just a form of hysteria.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Rourke|first=Meghan|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2004/02/crying_wolf.html|title=Crying Wolf|work=Slate|date=February 25, 2004|access-date=January 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeparately, a formal complaint was filed with the [[U.S. Department of Education]] [[Office for Civil Rights]] on March 15, 2011, by 16 current and former Yale students\u201412 female and 4 male\u2014describing a sexually hostile environment at Yale.

The secretary of state, along with the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|secretary of the treasury]], [[United States Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]], and [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]], are generally regarded as the four most important [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] members because of the importance of their respective departments.<ref>\"Cabinets and Counselors: The President and the Executive Branch\" (1997).

They must also advise the president on U.S. foreign matters such as the appointment of diplomats and ambassadors. They also advise the president of the dismissal and recall of these individuals. The secretary of state can conduct negotiations, interpret, and terminate treaties relating to foreign policy. They also can participate in international conferences, organizations and agencies as a representative of the United States. The secretary of state communicates issues relating to the U.S. foreign policy to Congress and U.S. citizens. They also provide services to U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad such as providing credentials in the form of passports. Doing this, they also ensure the protection of U.S. citizens themselves, their property, and interests in foreign countries.<ref name=\"Duties\">{{Cite news |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/115194.htm |title=Duties of the Secretary of State |work=U.S. Department of State |access-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSecretaries of state also have domestic responsibilities, entrusted in 1789, when the position was first created. These include the protection and custody of the Great Seal of the United States, and the preparation of some presidential proclamations. In the process of extraditing fugitives to or from the U.S., the secretary serves as the channel of communication between foreign governments and the federal government and the states.<ref name=\"Duties\" />\n\nMost of the domestic functions of the Department of State have been transferred to other agencies. Those that remain include storage and use of the Great Seal of the United States, performance of [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] functions for the [[White House]], and the drafting of certain proclamations.  The secretary also negotiates with the individual States over the extradition of fugitives to foreign countries.<ref name=\"duties\">{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/115194.htm|title=Duties of the Secretary of State of the United States|date=January 20, 2009|publisher=United States Department of State|work=www.state.gov|accessdate=March 28, 2010}}</ref> Under Federal Law,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/20|title=3 U.S. Code \u00a7 20 - Resignation or refusal of office}}</ref> the resignation of a president or of a vice president is only valid if declared in writing, in an instrument delivered to the office of the secretary of state. Accordingly, the resignations of President [[Watergate scandal#Final investigations and resignation|Richard Nixon]] and of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] were formalized in instruments delivered to Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]].\n\nAs the highest-ranking member of the cabinet, the secretary of state is the third-highest official of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States, after the president and vice president, and is fourth in [[United States presidential line of succession|line to succeed the presidency]], coming after the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House of Representatives]], and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore of the Senate]].
