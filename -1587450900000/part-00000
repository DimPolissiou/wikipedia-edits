Led by General [[Sam Houston]], the [[Texian Army]] engaged and defeated General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]'s [[United Mexican States (1824\u20131864)|Mexican]] army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes. A detailed, first-hand account of the battle was written by General Houston from Headquarters of the Texian Army, San Jacinto, on April 25, 1836.<ref>General Samuel Houston, Texian Officials, HQ of the Army, April 25, 1836 reproduced in the Daily National Intelligencer, Jun 11, 1836, Vol. XXIV, Issue 7280, p.2, Washington, DC</ref> Numerous secondary analyses and interpretations have followed.\n\n[[General Santa Anna]], the President of [[Mexico]], and General [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] both escaped during the battle. Santa Anna was captured the next day on April 22 and Cos on April 24, 1836. After being held about three weeks as a prisoner of war, Santa Anna signed the peace treaty that dictated that the Mexican army leave the region, paving the way for the [[Republic of Texas]] to become an independent country. These treaties did not necessarily recognize Texas as a sovereign nation, but stipulated that Santa Anna was to lobby for such recognition in Mexico City. In other words, Texas was de facto independent.  Sam Houston became a national celebrity, and the Texans' rallying cries from events of the war, \"Remember the [[Battle of the Alamo|Alamo]]!\" and \"Remember [[Goliad massacre|Goliad]]!\" became etched into Texan history and legend.\n\n==Background: December 1832 \u2013 March 1836==\n{{Main|Texas Revolution}}\n\n===The Mexican constitution is overturned===\nGeneral [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] was a proponent of governmental [[federalism]] when he helped oust Mexican president [[Anastasio Bustamante]] in December 1832.  Upon his election as president in April 1833,<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), p. 28</ref> Santa Anna switched his political ideology and began implementing centralist policies that increased the authoritarian powers of his office.<ref>Poyo (1996), pp. 42\u201343, \"Under the Mexican Flag\" (Andr\u00e9s Tijerina)</ref> His abrogation of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1824|Constitution of 1824]], correlating with his abolishing local-level authority over Mexico's state of ''[[Coahuila y Tejas]]'' (Coahuila and Texas), became a flashpoint in the growing tensions between the central government and its Tejano and Anglo citizens in Texas. While in Mexico City awaiting a meeting with Santa Anna, Texian empresario [[Stephen F. Austin]] wrote to the B\u00e9xar ''[[ayuntamiento]]'' (city council) urging a break-away state. In response, the Mexican government kept him imprisoned for most of 1834.<ref>Henderson (2008), pp. 86\u201387</ref><ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nColonel [[Juan Almonte]] was appointed Director of Colonization in Texas,<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 49, 57</ref> ostensibly to ease relations with the colonists and mitigate their anxieties about Austin's imprisonment.<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 38\u201339</ref> He delivered promises of self-governance, and conveyed regrets that the Mexican congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state. Behind the rhetoric, his covert mission was to identify the local power brokers, obstruct any plans for rebellion, and supply the Mexican government with data that would be of use in a military conflict. For nine months in 1834, under the guise of serving as a government liaison, Almonte traveled through Texas and compiled an all-encompassing intelligence report on the population and its environs, including an assessment of their resources and defense capabilities.<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 42\u201344, 208\u2013283</ref>\n\n===Cos is appointed military governor of Texas===\nIn consolidating his power base, Santa Anna installed General [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] as the governing military authority over Texas in 1835.<ref name=\"Davis 2004, p. 143\">Davis (2004), p. 143.</ref><ref name=\"Todish et al. 1998, p. 121\">Todish ''et al.''

It declared that foreigners who entered Mexico for the purpose of joining the rebellion were to be treated as \"pirates\", to be put to death if captured. In adding \"since they are not subjects of any nation at war with the republic nor do they militate under any recognized flag,\" Tornel avoided declaring war on the United States.<ref>Calore (2014), p. 56</ref><ref>Todish  ''et al.''

Concerned that his ill-trained and ill-disciplined force would be good for only one battle, and aware that his men could easily be outflanked by Urrea's forces, Houston continued to avoid engagement, to the immense displeasure of his troops.<ref name=hardin183and4>Hardin (1994), pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>  By March 28, the Texian army had retreated {{convert|120|mi|km}} across the [[Navidad River|Navidad]] and [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]s.<ref>Moore (2004), pp. 71, 74, 87, 134.</ref>  Many troops deserted; those who remained grumbled that their commander was a coward.<ref name=\"hardin183and4\"/>\n\nOn March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing, roughly {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of San Felipe.<ref group=Note>Groce's Landing is located roughly {{convert|9|mi|km}} northeast of modern-day [[Bellville, Texas|Bellville]].

While there, two cannons, known as the [[Twin Sisters (cannons)|Twin Sisters]], arrived from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].<ref name=hardin189>Hardin (1994), p. 189.</ref>  Interim Secretary of War [[Thomas Rusk]] joined the camp, with orders from President [[David G.

After receiving word that the acting president, [[Miguel Barrag\u00e1n]], had died, Santa Anna seriously considered returning to Mexico City to solidify his position.  Fear that Urrea's victories would position him as a political rival convinced Santa Anna to remain in Texas to personally oversee the final phase of the campaign.<ref name=davis254>Davis (2006), p. 254.</ref>  He left on March 29 to join Ram\u00edrez y Sesma, leaving only a small force to hold B\u00e9xar.<ref name=moore154>Moore (2004), p. 154.</ref>  At dawn on April 7, their combined force marched into San Felipe and captured a Texian soldier, who informed Santa Anna that the Texians planned to retreat further if the Mexican army crossed the Brazos River.<ref name=moore176>Moore (2004), p. 176.</ref>  Unable to cross the Brazos due to the small company of Texians barricaded at the river crossing, on April 14 a frustrated Santa Anna led a force of about 700 troops to capture the interim Texas government.<ref name=hardin190>Hardin (1994), p. 190.</ref><ref name=moore182>Moore (2004), p. 182.</ref>   Government officials fled mere hours before Mexican troops arrived in Harrisburgh (now [[Harrisburg, Houston]]) and Santa Anna sent Colonel [[Juan Almonte]] with 50 cavalry to intercept them in New Washington.  Almonte arrived just as Burnet shoved off in a rowboat, bound for [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston Island]].  Although the boat was still within range of their weapons, Almonte ordered his men to hold their fire so as not to endanger Burnet's family.<ref name=hardin191>Hardin (1994), p. 191.</ref>\n\nAt this point, Santa Anna believed the rebellion was in its final death throes.  The Texian government had been forced off the mainland, with no way to communicate with its army, which had shown no interest in fighting.  He determined to block the Texian army's retreat and put a decisive end to the war.<ref name=hardin191/>  Almonte's scouts incorrectly reported that Houston's army was going to Lynchburg Crossing, on [[Buffalo Bayou]], in preparation for joining the government in Galveston, so Santa Anna ordered Harrisburg burned and pressed on towards [[Lynchburg, Texas|Lynchburg]].<ref name=hardin191/>\n\nThe Texian army had resumed their march eastward.  On April 16, they came to a crossroads; one road led north towards [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]], the other went to Harrisburg.  Without orders from Houston and with no discussion amongst themselves, the troops in the lead took the road to Harrisburg.  They arrived on April 18, not long after the Mexican army's departure.<ref name=hardin192and3>Hardin (1994), pp. 190\u2013193.</ref>  That same day, [[Deaf Smith]] and [[Henry Karnes]] captured a Mexican courier carrying intelligence on the locations and future plans of all of the Mexican troops in Texas.  Realizing that Santa Anna had only a small force and was not far away, Houston gave a rousing speech to his men, exhorting them to \"Remember the Alamo\" and \"Remember Goliad\".  His army then raced towards Lynchburg.<ref name=hardin199and200>Hardin (1994), pp. 199\u2013200.</ref>  Out of concern that his men might not differentiate between Mexican soldiers and the ''Tejanos'' in Segu\u00edn's company, Houston originally ordered Segu\u00edn and his men to remain in Harrisburg to guard those who were too ill to travel quickly.  After loud protests from Segu\u00edn and [[Antonio Menchaca]], the order was rescinded, provided the ''Tejanos'' wear a piece of cardboard in their hats to identify them as Texian soldiers.<ref name=hardin209>Hardin (1994), p. 209.</ref>\n\n===San Jacinto===\n[[File:Battle of San Jacinto.jpg|thumb|left|300px|San Jacinto battlefield with troop movements]]\nThe area along Buffalo Bayou had many thick oak groves, separated by marshes.

Mexican soldiers were taken by surprise. Santa Anna,  Castrill\u00f3n, and Almonte yelled often conflicting orders, attempting to organize their men into some form of defense.<ref name=moore211>Moore (2004), p. 211.</ref> The Texian infantry forces advanced without halt until they had possession of the woodland and the Mexican breastwork; the right wing of Burleson's and the left wing of Millard's forces took possession of the breastwork.<ref name=\"Houston 1836\"/> Within 18 minutes, Mexican soldiers abandoned their campsite and fled for their lives.<ref name=davis271>Davis (2006), p. 271.</ref> The killing lasted for hours.<ref name=hardin213>Hardin (1994), p. 213.</ref>\n\nMany Mexican soldiers retreated through the marsh to Peggy Lake.<ref group=Note>Peggy Lake, also called Peggy's Lake, no longer exists. It was located southeast of the Mexican breastworks, which is now the site of the monument. Hardin (2004) pp. 71, 93</ref> Texian riflemen stationed themselves on the banks and shot at anything that moved. Many Texian officers, including Houston and Rusk, attempted to stop the slaughter, but they were unable to gain control of the men. Texians continued to chant \"Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!\" while frightened Mexican infantry yelled \"Me no Alamo!\" and begged for mercy to no avail.<ref name=hardin211to5>Hardin (1994), pp. 211\u2013215.</ref>  In what historian Davis called \"one of the most one-sided victories in history\",<ref name=davis274>Davis (2006), p. 274.</ref> 650 Mexican soldiers were killed and 300 captured.<ref name=hardin215>Hardin (1994), p. 215.</ref> Eleven Texians died, with 30 others, including Houston, wounded.<ref name=moore364>Moore (2004), p. 364.</ref>\n\nAlthough Santa Anna's troops had been thoroughly vanquished, they did not represent the bulk of the Mexican army in Texas. An additional 4,000 troops remained under the commands of Urrea and General [[Vicente Filisola]].<ref name=davis272>Davis (2006), p. 272.</ref> Texians had won the battle due to mistakes made by Santa Anna, and Houston was well aware that his troops would have little hope of repeating their victory against Urrea or Filisola.<ref name=davis273>Davis (2006), p. 273.</ref> As darkness fell, a large group of prisoners was led into camp.

Moore (2004), p. 339.</ref> Texian soldiers gathered around, calling for the Mexican general's immediate execution.  Bargaining for his life, Santa Anna suggested that he order the remaining Mexican troops to stay away.<ref name=hardin216>Hardin (1994), p. 216.</ref> In a letter to Filisola, who was now the senior Mexican official in Texas, Santa Anna wrote that \"yesterday evening [we] had an unfortunate encounter\" and ordered his troops to retreat to B\u00e9xar and await further instructions.<ref name=davis273/>\n\nUrrea urged Filisola to continue the campaign. He was confident that he could challenge the Texian troops. According to Hardin, \"Santa Anna had presented Mexico with one military disaster; Filisola did not wish to risk another.\"<ref name=hardin245>Hardin (1994), p. 245.</ref> Spring rains had ruined the ammunition and rendered the roads nearly impassable, with troops sinking to their knees in mud. The Mexican troops were soon out of food and began to fall ill from dysentery and other diseases.<ref name=davis277/> Their supply lines had broken down, leaving no hope of further reinforcements.<ref name=hardin246>Hardin (1994), p. 246.</ref> Filisola later wrote that \"Had the enemy met us under these cruel circumstances, on the only road that was left, no alternative remained but to die or surrender at discretion\".<ref name=davis277>Davis (2006), p. 277.</ref>\n\nFor several weeks after San Jacinto, Santa Anna continued to negotiate with Houston, Rusk, and then Burnet.<ref name=davis279>Davis (2006), p. 279.</ref> Santa Anna suggested two treaties, a public version of promises made between the two countries, and a private version that included Santa Anna's personal agreements. The [[Treaties of Velasco]] required that all Mexican troops withdraw south of the Rio Grande and that all private property be respected and restored. Prisoners of war would be released unharmed and Santa Anna would be given immediate passage to Veracruz. He secretly promised to persuade the Mexican Congress to acknowledge the Republic of Texas and to recognize the Rio Grande as the border between the two countries.<ref name=davis282>Davis (2006), p. 282.</ref>\n\nWhen Urrea began marching south in mid-May, many families from San Patricio who had supported the Mexican army went with him. When Texian troops arrived in early June, they found only 20 families remaining. The area around San Patricio and Refugio suffered a \"noticeable depopulation\" in the Republic of Texas years.<ref name=lack180>Lack (1992), p. 180.</ref> Although the treaty had specified that Urrea and Filisola would return any slaves their armies had sheltered, Urrea refused to comply. Many former slaves followed the army to Mexico, where they could be free.<ref name=lack245>Lack (1992), p. 245.</ref> By late May, the Mexican troops had crossed the Nueces.<ref name=davis277/>  Filisola fully expected that the defeat was temporary and that a second campaign would be launched to retake Texas.<ref name=hardin246/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Military===\n[[File:Last Known Texian Veterans of the Texas Revolution (2).jpg|thumb|April 21, 1906 Army of the Republic of Texas veteran reunion.

For the next two days, crowds of soldiers, many of whom had arrived that week from the United States, gathered to demand his execution.

Upon his arrival, the Mexican press wasted no time in attacking him for his cruelty towards those executed at Goliad.

Led by General [[Sam Houston]], the [[Texian Army]] engaged and defeated General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]'s [[United Mexican States (1824\u20131864)|Mexican]] army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes. A detailed, first-hand account of the battle was written by General Houston from Headquarters of the Texian Army, San Jacinto, on April 25, 1836.<ref>General Samuel Houston, Texian Officials, HQ of the Army, April 25, 1836 reproduced in the Daily National Intelligencer, Jun 11, 1836, Vol. XXIV, Issue 7280, p.2, Washington, DC</ref> Numerous secondary analyses and interpretations have followed.\n\n[[General Santa Anna]], the President of [[Mexico]], and General [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] both escaped during the battle. Santa Anna was captured the next day on April 22 and Cos on April 24, 1836. After being held about three weeks as a prisoner of war, Santa Anna signed the peace treaty that dictated that the Mexican army leave the region, paving the way for the [[Republic of Texas]] to become an independent country. These treaties did not necessarily recognize Texas as a sovereign nation, but stipulated that Santa Anna was to lobby for such recognition in Mexico City. In other words, Texas was de facto independent.  Sam Houston became a national celebrity, and the Texans' rallying cries from events of the war, \"Remember the [[Alamo]]!\" and \"Remember [[Goliad massacre|Goliad]]!\" became etched into Texan history and legend.\n\n==Background: December 1832 \u2013 March 1836==\n{{Main|Texas Revolution}}\n\n===The Mexican constitution is overturned===\nGeneral [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] was a proponent of governmental [[federalism]] when he helped oust Mexican president [[Anastasio Bustamante]] in December 1832.  Upon his election as president in April 1833,<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), p. 28</ref> Santa Anna switched his political ideology and began implementing centralist policies that increased the authoritarian powers of his office.<ref>Poyo (1996), pp. 42\u201343, \"Under the Mexican Flag\" (Andr\u00e9s Tijerina)</ref> His abrogation of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1824|Constitution of 1824]], correlating with his abolishing local-level authority over Mexico's state of ''[[Coahuila y Tejas]]'' (Coahuila and Texas), became a flashpoint in the growing tensions between the central government and its Tejano and Anglo citizens in Texas. While in Mexico City awaiting a meeting with Santa Anna, Texian empresario [[Stephen F. Austin]] wrote to the B\u00e9xar ''[[ayuntamiento]]'' (city council) urging a break-away state. In response, the Mexican government kept him imprisoned for most of 1834.<ref>Henderson (2008), pp. 86\u201387</ref><ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nColonel [[Juan Almonte]] was appointed Director of Colonization in Texas,<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 49, 57</ref> ostensibly to ease relations with the colonists and mitigate their anxieties about Austin's imprisonment.<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 38\u201339</ref> He delivered promises of self-governance, and conveyed regrets that the Mexican congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state. Behind the rhetoric, his covert mission was to identify the local power brokers, obstruct any plans for rebellion, and supply the Mexican government with data that would be of use in a military conflict. For nine months in 1834, under the guise of serving as a government liaison, Almonte traveled through Texas and compiled an all-encompassing intelligence report on the population and its environs, including an assessment of their resources and defense capabilities.<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 42\u201344, 208\u2013283</ref>\n\n===Cos is appointed military governor of Texas===\nIn consolidating his power base, Santa Anna installed General [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] as the governing military authority over Texas in 1835.<ref name=\"Davis 2004, p. 143\">Davis (2004), p. 143.</ref><ref name=\"Todish et al. 1998, p. 121\">Todish ''et al.''

It declared that foreigners who entered Mexico for the purpose of joining the rebellion were to be treated as \"pirates\", to be put to death if captured.

Concerned that his ill-trained and ill-disciplined force would be good for only one battle, and aware that his men could easily be outflanked by Urrea's forces, Houston continued to avoid engagement, to the immense displeasure of his troops.<ref name=hardin183and4>Hardin (1994), pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>  By March 28, the Texian army had retreated {{convert|120|mi|km}} across the [[Navidad River|Navidad]] and [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]s.<ref>Moore (2004), pp. 71, 74, 87, 134.</ref>  Many troops deserted; those who remained grumbled that their commander was a coward.<ref name=\"hardin183and4\"/>\n\nOn March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing, roughly {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of San Felipe.<ref group=Note>Groce's Landing is located roughly {{convert|9|mi|km}} northeast of modern-day [[Bellville, Texas|Bellville]].

After receiving word that the acting president, [[Miguel Barrag\u00e1n]], had died, Santa Anna seriously considered returning to Mexico City to solidify his position.

Almonte arrived just as Burnet shoved off in a rowboat, bound for [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston Island]].  Although the boat was still within range of their weapons, Almonte ordered his men to hold their fire so as not to endanger Burnet's family.<ref name=hardin191>Hardin (1994), p. 191.</ref>\n\nAt this point, Santa Anna believed the rebellion was in its final death throes.  The Texian government had been forced off the mainland, with no way to communicate with its army, which had shown no interest in fighting.  He determined to block the Texian army's retreat and put a decisive end to the war.<ref name=hardin191/>  Almonte's scouts incorrectly reported that Houston's army was going to Lynchburg Crossing, on [[Buffalo Bayou]], in preparation for joining the government in Galveston, so Santa Anna ordered Harrisburg burned and pressed on towards [[Lynchburg, Texas|Lynchburg]].<ref name=hardin191/>\n\nThe Texian army had resumed their march eastward.  On April 16, they came to a crossroads; one road led north towards [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]], the other went to Harrisburg.  Without orders from Houston and with no discussion amongst themselves, the troops in the lead took the road to Harrisburg.  They arrived on April 18, not long after the Mexican army's departure.<ref name=hardin192and3>Hardin (1994), pp. 190\u2013193.</ref>  That same day, [[Deaf Smith]] and [[Henry Karnes]] captured a Mexican courier carrying intelligence on the locations and future plans of all of the Mexican troops in Texas.  Realizing that Santa Anna had only a small force and was not far away, Houston gave a rousing speech to his men, exhorting them to \"Remember the Alamo\" and \"Remember Goliad\".  His army then raced towards Lynchburg.<ref name=hardin199and200>Hardin (1994), pp. 199\u2013200.</ref>  Out of concern that his men might not differentiate between Mexican soldiers and the ''Tejanos'' in Segu\u00edn's company, Houston originally ordered Segu\u00edn and his men to remain in Harrisburg to guard those who were too ill to travel quickly.  After loud protests from Segu\u00edn and [[Antonio Menchaca]], the order was rescinded, provided the ''Tejanos'' wear a piece of cardboard in their hats to identify them as Texian soldiers.<ref name=hardin209>Hardin (1994), p. 209.</ref>\n\n===San Jacinto===\n[[File:Battle of San Jacinto.jpg|thumb|left|300px|San Jacinto battlefield with troop movements]]\nThe area along Buffalo Bayou had many thick oak groves, separated by marshes.

One of them being Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj. He was said to have the power of working miracles. He told Ibn Battuta that he should go find his three brothers, Farid Oddin, who lived in India, Rokn Oddin Ibn Zakarya, who lived in Sindia, and Borhan Oddin, who lived in China. Battuta then made it his purpose to find these people and give them his compliments. Sheikh Yakut was another great man. He was the disciple of Sheikh Abu Abbas El Mursi, who was the disciple of Abu El Hasan El Shadali, who is known to be a servant of God. Abu Abbas was the author of the Hizb El Bahr and was famous for piety and miracles. Abu Abd Allah El Murshidi was a great interpreting saint that lived secluded in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. He lived alone but was visited daily by emirs, viziers, and crowds that wished to eat with him. The Sultan of Egypt (El Malik El Nasir) visited him, as well. Ibn Battuta left Alexandria with the intent of visiting him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The travels of Ibn Battuta in the Near East, Asia and Africa 1304\u20131377|author=Ibn Batuta|date=2009|publisher=Cosimo|translator=Lee, Samuel|isbn=9781605206219|location=New York|oclc=502998972}}</ref>\n\nIbn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on 2 occasions; in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated further, making entrance to the edifice impossible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IQSBAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA155&lpg=PA155&dq=Ibn+battuta+pharos&source=bl&ots=RU2ZqokAyb&sig=ACfU3U0hWpISSXH_fJOMtHR_xkUuGxkDPg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiU9qL8967nAhXlnFwKHfPDDSAQ6AEwDnoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&q=Ibn+battuta+pharos&f=false|title=The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|first1=Peter A.|last1=Clayton|first2=Martin|last2=Price|date=21 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n===Timeline===\nThe most important battles and sieges of Alexandria include:\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)]], Julius Caesar's civil war\n*[[Battle of Alexandria (30 BC)]], final war of the Roman Republic\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (619)]], Byzantine-Persian Wars\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (641)]], Rashidun conquest of Byzantine Egypt\n*[[Alexandrian Crusade]] (1365), a crusade led by Peter de Lusignan of Cyprus which resulted in the defeat of the Mamluks and the sack of the city.\n*[[Battle of Alexandria|Battle of Alexandria (1801)]], Napoleonic Wars\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (1801)]], Napoleonic Wars\n*[[Alexandria expedition of 1807|Alexandria expedition (1807)]], Napoleonic Wars\n\n==Ancient layout==\n\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:[[File:Macedonian Army Alexander.jpg|thumb|[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Army, shown on the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]].]]\n;Brucheum\n:Brucheum is the Royal or Greek quarter and forms the most magnificent portion of the city. In [[Outline of ancient Rome|Roman times]] Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal;\n;The Jewish quarter\n:This quarter is the northeast portion of the city;\n;Rhakotis\n:[[Rhacotis|Rhakotis]] is the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. (from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Rakot\u0259'' \"Alexandria\").\n[[File:Canopic Street Alexandria 1784 by LF Cassa.png|thumb|[[Engraving]] by L F Cassas of the [[Canopic Street]] in Alexandria, [[Egypt]] made in 1784.]]Two main streets, lined with [[colonnade]]s and said to have been each about {{convert|sp=us|60|m|ft}} wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his [[Mausoleum]]) rose. This point is very near the present [[mosque]] of [[Nebi Daniel]]; and the line of the great East\u2013West \"Canopic\" street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.\n\nAlexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a {{convert|1260|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} [[mole (architecture)|mole]] and called the ''Heptastadion'' (\"seven stadia\"\u2014a ''[[stadium]]'' was a Greek [[unit of length]] measuring approximately {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.\n\nIn [[Strabo]]'s time, (latter half of the 1st century BC) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.\n\n#The [[Palace|Royal Palaces]], filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbor on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port,\" and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land [[subsidence]] here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\n#The Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by [[Julius Caesar]] as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the [[battle of Pharsalus]]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}{{clarify|reason=Caesar retreated from a mob??|date=July 2014}}\n#The [[Poseidon]], or [[Greek temple|Temple]] of the Sea God, close to the theater\n#The Timonium built by [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]]\n#The Emporium (Exchange)\n#The Apostases (Magazines)\n#The Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\n#Behind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great [[obelisk]]s, which become known as \"[[Cleopatra's Needle]]s,\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\n#The [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Palaestra]] are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\n#The Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]; alexandria west.\n#The Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\n#The [[Musaeum]] with its famous [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] and theater in the same region; site unknown.\n#The [[Serapeum of Alexandria]], the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar,\" which was an independent monument erected to commemorate [[Diocletian]]'s siege of the city.\n\nThe names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|The Great Lighthouse]], one of the [[Wonders of the World|Seven Wonders of the World]], reputed to be {{convert|138|m|ft|abbr=off}} high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]) completed it, at a total cost of 800&nbsp;[[Talent (measurement)|talent]]s. It took 12&nbsp;years to complete and served as a [[prototype]] for all later [[lighthouse]]s in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. A temple of [[Hephaestus]] also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\n\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens,<ref>Rostovtzeff 1941: (1138\u201339)</ref> according to a census dated from 32 CE, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves.

Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god [[Serapis]] were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.\n\nAlexandria's [[catacombs]], known as ''[[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Kom El Shoqafa]]'', are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large [[Stairway|spiral staircase]], and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other [[syncretism|syncretic]] Romano-Egyptian [[Religious symbolism|religious symbols]], burial niches, and [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased.

It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its [[Thermae|Roman-era baths]].\n\nPersistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.\nThe past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] made tentative researches on behalf of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898\u20131899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\n[[File:Magna temple1.JPG|thumb|right|Side view of The Temple of Taposiris Magna.]]\n\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. [[Cleopatra VII]]'s royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual [[subsidence]] in the 4th century AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.underwaterdiscovery.org/Sitemap/Project/Alexandria/Default.aspx |title=Fgs Project Alexandria |publisher=Underwaterdiscovery.org |accessdate=14 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307175057/http://www.underwaterdiscovery.org/Sitemap/Project/Alexandria/Default.aspx |archivedate=7 March 2010 }}</ref> This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist [[Franck Goddio]] and his [[underwater archaeology|team]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/203470.stm |title=Divers probe underwater palace |work=BBC News |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=19 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318091311/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/203470.stm |archive-date=18 March 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> It raised a noted head of [[Caesarion]].

Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense [[catacombs]] and ''columbaria'' have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\n\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in [[Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa|Kom El Shoqafa]] (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\n\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of [[Kom El Deka]], which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\n\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\".\n\n===Temple of Taposiris Magna===\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine [[Pharos Lighthouse]].<ref>Judith McKenzie et al., The Architecture of Alexandria and Egypt, C. 300 B.C. to A.D. 700\nNew Haven CT: Yale University Press, 2007. 41-48.\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=KFNCaZEZKYAC\n{{ISBN|9780300115550}}</ref>\n\n==Places of worship==\nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.<ref>Britannica,\n[https://www.britannica.com/place/Egypt Egypt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708222509/https://www.britannica.com/place/Egypt |date=8 July 2019 }}, britannica.com, USA, accessed on 7 July 2019</ref> There are also [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], [[Coptic Catholic Church]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Evangelical Church of Egypt (Synod of the Nile)]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]).\n\n{{Multiple image\n|align =right\n|direction=vertical\n|header =Places of worship in Alexandria\n|header_align=center\n|width =180\n|image1 =Mezquita abu el abbas-alejandria-2007.JPG\n|alt1  =\n|caption1 =[[El-Mursi Abul Abbas Mosque]]\n|image2 =StCatherineChurchAlexandria.jpg\n|alt2  =\n|caption2 =[[Latin Church|Latin Catholic]] church of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] in Mansheya\n|image3 =Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue in Alexandria.jpg\n|alt3  =\n|caption3 =[[Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue (Alexandria)|Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue]]\n}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also|List of mosques in Alexandria}}\nThe most famous mosque in Alexandria is [[Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque]] in [[Bahary]].

The [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]] was second only to the [[bishop of Rome]], the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] until 430. The [[Church of Alexandria]] had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, the Church of Alexandria was split between the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] and the [[Melkite]]s. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. In the 19th century, [[Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\n\nToday, the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Alexandria)|Saint Mark Cathedral]] in Ramleh. The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include [[Cyril of Alexandria|Pope Cyril I]] Church in Cleopatra, [[Saint George]]s Church in Sporting, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] & [[Pope Peter I of Alexandria|Pope Peter I]] Church in Sidi Bishr, [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Saint Mary]] Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, [[Saint Menas|Saint Mina]] Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and [[St. Takla Haymanot's Church (Alexandria)|Saint Takla Haymanot's Church]] in Ibrahimeya.\n\nThe most important [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches in Alexandria are [[Holy Unmercenaries|Agioi An\u00e1rgyroi]] Church, Church of the [[Annunciation]], [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]] Church, [[Gabriel|Archangels Gabriel]] & [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] Church, Taxiarchon Church, [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] Church, Cathedral of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]] in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, [[Elijah|Prophet Elijah]] Church, [[Saint George]] Church, [[Saint Joseph]] Church in Fleming, [[Joseph of Arimathea|Saint Joseph of Arimathea]] Church, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] & [[Nectarios of Aegina|Saint Nektarios]] Chapel in Ramleh, [[Saint Nicholas]] Church, [[Paraskevi of Rome|Saint Paraskevi]] Church, [[Saint Sava]] Cathedral in Ramleh, [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore]] Chapel and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] church of [[Alexander Nevsky|Saint Alexander Nevsky]] in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\n\nThe [[Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said]] has jurisdiction over all [[Latin Church]] Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its [[Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan]], which uses the [[Byzantine Rite]], and the nominal see of the [[Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria]] (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the [[Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia]], using the [[Armenian Rite]].\n\nThe Saint Mark Church in [[Shatby]], founded as part of [[Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Alexandria|Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc]], is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] and Coptic Orthodox rites.\n\nIn antiquity, Alexandria was a major center of the cosmopolitan religious movement called [[Gnosticism]] (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\n===Judaism===\n[[File:Egyptian Alexandria Jewish girls during BatMitzva.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish girls during [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bat Mitzva]] in Alexandria]]\n{{see also|History of the Jews in Egypt}}\nAlexandria's once-flourishing Jewish community declined rapidly following the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], after which negative reactions towards [[Zionism]] among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt fled to the newly established [[Israel]], [[France]], [[Brazil]] and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50.<ref>[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/12/20/2742246/egypt-plans-to-restore-alexandrias-historic-synagogue Egypt to restore Alexandria's historic synagogue], (20 December 2010) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224165555/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/12/20/2742246/egypt-plans-to-restore-alexandrias-historic-synagogue |date=24 December 2010 }}</ref> The most important [[synagogue]] in Alexandria is the [[Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue (Alexandria)|Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue]].\n\n==Education==\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n[[File:Saint-Marc Alexandria.jpg|thumb|[[Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Alexandria|Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc]]]]\nAlexandria has a number of higher education institutions. [[Alexandria University]] is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its [[Alexandria Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]] & [[Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University|Faculty of Engineering]]. In addition, the [[Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology]] in [[New Borg El Arab]] city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010.  The [[Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport]] is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC [[American University in Cairo]] because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. [[Senghor University|Universit\u00e9 Senghor]] is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly recruits students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include [[Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering and Technology|Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT)]] and [[Pharos University in Alexandria]].\n\n===Schools===\n[[File:Lycee Francais d'Alexandrie 2001.JPG|thumb|[[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais d'Alexandrie]]]]\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by [[Catholic]] missionaries include [[Coll\u00e8ge de la M\u00e8re de Dieu]], Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Sion, [[Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Alexandria|Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc]], Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), \u00c9cole Girard, \u00c9cole Saint Gabriel, \u00c9cole Saint-Vincent de Paul, \u00c9cole Saint Joseph, \u00c9cole Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lyc\u00e9e el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais d'Alexandrie (\u00c9cole Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the [[Istituto \"Don Bosco\"]].\n\nEnglish schools in Alexandria are becoming the most popular. English-language schools in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, [[British School of Alexandria]], Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, [[Schutz American School, Alexandria|Schutz American School]], [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]], [[Manar English Girls School|El Manar Language School for Girls]] (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and [[El Nasr Girls' College]].\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are [[Deutsche Schule der Borrom\u00e4erinnen Alexandria|Deutsche Schule der Borrom\u00e4rinnen]] (DSB of Saint Charles Borrom\u00e9) and [[Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam]].\n\nThe [[Montessori education|Montessori]] educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at [[Alexandria Montessori]].\n\nThe most notable public schools in Alexandria include El Abbassia High School and Gamal Abdel Nasser High School.\n\n===Women===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\nCirca the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to the same percentage in Cairo.

Intercity passenger service is operated by [[Egyptian National Railways]].\n\n===Trams===\n{{Main|Trams in Alexandria}}\n[[File:The yellow tram passing through Saad Zaghloul's square.jpg|thumb|An Alexandria tram]]\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the [[Mahatet El Raml|El Raml district]] in the west and ends in the [[Victoria (neighborhood)|Victoria district]] in the east. Most of the vehicles are blue in color. Some smaller yellow-colored vehicles have further routes beyond the two main endpoints. The tram routes have one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, and 6. All four start at El Raml, but only two (1 and 2) reach Victoria. There are two converging and diverging points. The first starts at [[Bolkly]] (Isis) and ends at [[San Stefano (neighborhood)|San Stefano]]. The other begins at [[Sporting (neighborhood)|Sporting]] and ends at Mostafa Kamel. Route 5 starts at San Stefano and takes the inner route to Bolkly. Route 6 starts at Sidi Gaber El Sheikh in the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 1 takes the inner route between San Stefano and Bolkly and the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 2 takes the route opposite to Route 1 in both these areas. The tram fares are 50 piastres (0.50 pounds), and 100 piastres (1.00 pounds) for the middle car. Some trams (that date back the 30s) charge a pound. The tram is considered the cheapest method of public transport. A caf\u00e9 operates in the second floor of the first car of tram 1 (a women-only car) which costs 5 L.E per person, also offering a WiFi service. A luxury light blue tram car operates from San Stefano to Ras El Tin, with free WiFi and movies and songs played inside for 5 L.E per ticket.\n\n'''Stations:'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n# Baccos \u2013 Victoria (Number 1)\n# Al Seyouf\n# Sidi Beshr\n# El Saraya\n# Laurent Louran\n# Tharwat\n# San Stefano\n# Gianaklis\n# Schutz\n# Safar\n# Abou Shabana (Baccos)\n# Al Karnak (Fleming)\n# Al Wezara (The Ministry)\n# Isis Bolkly Bulkley\n# Roushdy\n# Mohammed Mahfouz\n# Mustafa Kamil\n# Sidi Gaber Al-Sheikh\n# Cleopatra Hammamat (Cleopatra Baths)\n# Cleopatra El Soghra\n# El Reyada El Kobra (Sporting El Kobra)\n# El Reyada El Soghra (Sporting Al Soghra)\n# Al Ibrahimiyya\n# El Moaskar (Camp Caesar)\n# Al Gamaa (The University)\n# Al Shatby\n# El Shobban El Moslemin\n# El Shahid Moustafa Ziean\n# Hassan Rasim (Azarita)\n# Gamea' Ibrahim (Mosque of Ibrahim)\n# Mahattet Al Ramleh (Ramlh Station)\n{{div col end}}\n'''Route 2 serves:'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n# El Nasr \u2013 Victoria (Number 2)\n# Al Seyouf\n# Sidi Beshr\n# El Saraya\n# Louran\n# Tharwat\n# San Stefano\n# Kasr El Safa (Zizini Al Safa Palace)\n# Al Fonoun Al Gamella (The Fine Arts)\n# Ramsis (Glym or Gleem)\n# El Bostan (Saba Pasha)\n# Al Hedaya (The Guidance)\n# Isis Bolkly\n# Roushdy\n# Mohammed Mahfouz\n# Mustafa Kamil\n# Sidi Gaber El Mahata (Railway station)\n# Cleopatra (Zananere)\n# El Reyada El Kobra (Sporting El Kobra)\n# El Reyada El Soghra (Sporting Al Soghra)\n# Al Ibrahimiyya\n# El Moaskar (Camp Chezar)\n# Al Gamaa (The University)\n# Al Shatby\n# El Shobban El Moslemin\n# El Shahid Moustafa Ziean\n# Hassan Rasim (Azarita)\n# Gamea' Ibrahim (Mosque of Ibrahim)\n# Mahattet Al Ramlh (Ramlh Station)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Metro===\nConstruction of the [[Alexandria Metro]] is due to begin in 2020 at a cost of $1.05 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://meconstructionnews.com/37864/egypts-1bn-alexandria-metro-to-start-construction-in-q1-2020|title=Egypt's $1bn Alexandria Metro to start construction in Q1 2020|website=Middle East Construction News|date=10 November 2019|accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Taxis and minibuses===\n{{see also|Taxicabs by country#Egypt}}\nTaxis in Alexandria sport a yellow-and-black [[livery]] and are widely available.

It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the [[Muse]]s\u2014the [[Musaeum|Museion]], Greek ''\u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03bd'' (from which the [[Modern English]] word ''[[Museum#Etymology|museum]]'' is derived).\n\nIt has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Raven|first1=James|title=Lost Libraries: The Destruction of Great Book Collections Since Antiquity|date=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=0230524257|page=12}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/10/dayintech-1016bibliotheca/|title=Oct. 16, 2002: Second Great Library Opens in Alexandria|first=Tony|last=Long|date=16 October 2009|via=www.wired.com}}</ref>\n\n===Museums===\n{{multiple image|total_width=440|align=right\n|width1=1280|height1=960|image1=GD-EG-Alex-Mus\u00e9eNat040.JPG|caption1=[[Alexandria National Museum|The Alexandria National Museum]]\n|width2=1280|height2=960|image2=Flickr - archer10 (Dennis) - Egypt-14A-048.jpg|caption2=Graeco-Roman Museum\n|width3=1280|height3=960|image3=AlexRoyalJewelleryMusLeft.jpg|caption3=Royal Jewelry Museum\n}}\n*The [[Alexandria National Museum]] was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq El Horreya Street (formerly Rue Fouad), near the center of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and [[Egypt]]. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.\n*[[Cavafy Museum]]\n*[[Graeco-Roman Museum|The Graeco-Roman Museum]]\n*The Museum of Fine Arts\n*The [[Royal Jewelry Museum]]\n\n===Theaters===\n*[[Alexandria Opera House]], where classical music, Arabic music, ballet, and opera are performed and bearm basha theatre in elshatby.\n\n== Architecture ==\nThroughout Alexandra, there is art that resembles some of the oldest architectural styles of the Hellenic city, and its ancient decorations, especially in the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]], is based on reviving the ancient [[Library of Alexandria]]. The Kom el shoqafa Catacombs are considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages and date back to the 2nd century. The remnants of Pompey's Pillar still remain today. This single pillar represents the elaborate temple which once stood in Alexandria. It remains at the site of the Serapeum, Alexandria's acropolis. The Serapeum, which stood for ancient tradition, conflicted with the rise of Christianity. It is a large tourist destination, today. the Roman Amphitheatre of Alexandria is another popular destination. Here, there remains a stage with around seven hundred to eight hundred seats. They also have numerous galleries of statues and details leftover form this time. Alexandria's tourism office announced plans to reserve some beaches for tourists in July 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/life/egypt-s-alexandria-to-create-private-tourist-only-beaches-19223|title=Egypt's Alexandria to create private tourist-only beaches|website=Egypt's Alexandria to create private tourist-only beaches|language=tr-TR|access-date=30 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730110845/https://www.trtworld.com/life/egypt-s-alexandria-to-create-private-tourist-only-beaches-19223|archive-date=30 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Shalalat gardens.JPG|Shalalat Gardens\nFile:Tree House.jpg|[[Montaza|Montaza Garden]]\nFile:Zentrum der Kunst in Alexandria, \u00c4gypten.jpg|Alexandria Art Center\nFile:Pict0179.jpg|[[Alexandria Opera House]]\nFile:Fawzia fahmy palace.jpg|Fawzia Fahmy Palace\nFile:\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u062a\u064a\u0646 (103).jpg|[[Alexander the Great]]'s statue\nFile:Monument of the Navy Unknown Soldier in Alexandria (6).jpg|Monument of the Unknown Navy Soldier\nFile:King Farouk palace.jpg|[[Montaza Palace]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:GD-EG-Alex-Stade002.JPG|thumb|[[Alexandria Stadium]]]]\n\nThe main sport that interests Alexandrians is soccer, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. [[Alexandria Stadium]] is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in Alexandria, [[Egypt]]. It is currently used mostly for soccer matches, and was used for the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006 African Cup of Nations]]. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the [[Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations]] in January 2006, which [[Egypt national soccer team|Egypt]] won. Sea sports such as [[surfing]], [[Personal water craft|jet-skiing]] and [[water polo]] are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the [[Alexandria Sporting Club]], which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the [[Egypt national basketball team|country's national team]] with key players. The city hosted the [[AfroBasket]], the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).\n\nAlexandria has four [[stadium]]s:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Alexandria Stadium]]\n*[[Borg El Arab Stadium]]\n*El Krom Stadium\n*[[Harras El Hodoud Stadium]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nOther less popular sports like tennis and [[squash (sport)|squash]] are usually played in private [[Social club|social]] and [[sports club]]s, like:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Acacia Country Club\n*Alexandria Sporting Club \u2013 in \"[[Sporting, Alexandria, Egypt|Sporting]]\"\n*Alexandria Country club\n*[[Al Ittihad Alexandria Club]]\n*[[Olympic Club (Egypt)|Olympic Club]]\n*[[Haras El Hodoud SC]] Club\n*[[Koroum]] Club\n*Lagoon Resort Courts\n*[[Smouha SC]] \u2013 in \"[[Smouha]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n\nStarted in 2011, [[Cross Egypt Challenge]] is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt.

Ibn Battuta left Alexandria with the intent of visiting him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The travels of Ibn Battuta in the Near East, Asia and Africa 1304\u20131377|author=Ibn Batuta|date=2009|publisher=Cosimo|translator=Lee, Samuel|isbn=9781605206219|location=New York|oclc=502998972}}</ref>\n\nIbn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on 2 occasions; in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated further, making entrance to the edifice impossible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IQSBAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA155&lpg=PA155&dq=Ibn+battuta+pharos&source=bl&ots=RU2ZqokAyb&sig=ACfU3U0hWpISSXH_fJOMtHR_xkUuGxkDPg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiU9qL8967nAhXlnFwKHfPDDSAQ6AEwDnoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&q=Ibn+battuta+pharos&f=false|title=The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|first1=Peter A.|last1=Clayton|first2=Martin|last2=Price|date=21 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n===Timeline===\nThe most important battles and sieges of Alexandria include:\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)]], Julius Caesar's civil war\n*[[Battle of Alexandria (30 BC)]], final war of the Roman Republic\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (619)]], Byzantine-Persian Wars\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (641)]], Rashidun conquest of Byzantine Egypt\n*[[Alexandrian Crusade]] (1365), a crusade led by Peter de Lusignan of Cyprus which resulted in the defeat of the Mamluks and the sack of the city.\n*[[Battle of Alexandria|Battle of Alexandria (1801)]], Napoleonic Wars\n*[[Siege of Alexandria (1801)]], Napoleonic Wars\n*[[Alexandria expedition of 1807|Alexandria expedition (1807)]], Napoleonic Wars\n\n==Ancient layout==\n\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:[[File:Macedonian Army Alexander.jpg|thumb|[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Army, shown on the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]].]]\n;Brucheum\n:Brucheum is the Royal or Greek quarter and forms the most magnificent portion of the city. In [[Outline of ancient Rome|Roman times]] Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal;\n;The Jewish quarter\n:This quarter is the northeast portion of the city;\n;Rhakotis\n:[[Rhacotis|Rhakotis]] is the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. (from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Rakot\u0259'' \"Alexandria\").\n[[File:Canopic Street Alexandria 1784 by LF Cassa.png|thumb|[[Engraving]] by L F Cassas of the [[Canopic Street]] in Alexandria, [[Egypt]] made in 1784.]]Two main streets, lined with [[colonnade]]s and said to have been each about {{convert|sp=us|60|m|ft}} wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his [[Mausoleum]]) rose. This point is very near the present [[mosque]] of [[Nebi Daniel]]; and the line of the great East\u2013West \"Canopic\" street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.\n\nAlexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a {{convert|1260|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} [[mole (architecture)|mole]] and called the ''Heptastadion'' (\"seven stadia\"\u2014a ''[[stadium]]'' was a Greek [[unit of length]] measuring approximately {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.\n\nIn [[Strabo]]'s time, (latter half of the 1st century BC) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.\n\n#The [[Palace|Royal Palaces]], filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbor on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port,\" and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land [[subsidence]] here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\n#The Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by [[Julius Caesar]] as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the [[battle of Pharsalus]]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}{{clarify|reason=Caesar retreated from a mob??|date=July 2014}}\n#The [[Poseidon]], or [[Greek temple|Temple]] of the Sea God, close to the theater\n#The Timonium built by [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]]\n#The Emporium (Exchange)\n#The Apostases (Magazines)\n#The Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\n#Behind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great [[obelisk]]s, which become known as \"[[Cleopatra's Needle]]s,\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\n#The [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Palaestra]] are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\n#The Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]; alexandria west.\n#The Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\n#The [[Musaeum]] with its famous [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] and theater in the same region; site unknown.\n#The [[Serapeum of Alexandria]], the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar,\" which was an independent monument erected to commemorate [[Diocletian]]'s siege of the city.\n\nThe names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|The Great Lighthouse]], one of the [[Wonders of the World|Seven Wonders of the World]], reputed to be {{convert|138|m|ft|abbr=off}} high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]) completed it, at a total cost of 800&nbsp;[[Talent (measurement)|talent]]s. It took 12&nbsp;years to complete and served as a [[prototype]] for all later [[lighthouse]]s in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. A temple of [[Hephaestus]] also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\n\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens,<ref>Rostovtzeff 1941: (1138\u201339)</ref> according to a census dated from 32 CE, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves.

Hogarth]] made tentative researches on behalf of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898\u20131899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\n[[File:Magna temple1.JPG|thumb|right|Side view of The Temple of Taposiris Magna.]]\n\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. [[Cleopatra VII]]'s royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual [[subsidence]] in the 4th century AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.underwaterdiscovery.org/Sitemap/Project/Alexandria/Default.aspx |title=Fgs Project Alexandria |publisher=Underwaterdiscovery.org |accessdate=14 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307175057/http://www.underwaterdiscovery.org/Sitemap/Project/Alexandria/Default.aspx |archivedate=7 March 2010 }}</ref> This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist [[Franck Goddio]] and his [[underwater archaeology|team]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/203470.stm |title=Divers probe underwater palace |work=BBC News |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=19 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318091311/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/203470.stm |archive-date=18 March 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> It raised a noted head of [[Caesarion]].

Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense [[catacombs]] and ''columbaria'' have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\n\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in [[Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa|Kom El Shoqafa]] (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\n\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of [[Kom El Deka]], which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\n\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\".\n\n===Temple of Taposiris Magna===\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine [[Pharos Lighthouse]].<ref>Judith McKenzie et al., The Architecture of Alexandria and Egypt, C. 300 B.C. to A.D. 700\nNew Haven CT: Yale University Press, 2007. 41-48.\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=KFNCaZEZKYAC\n{{ISBN|9780300115550}}</ref>\n\n==Places of worship==\nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.<ref>Britannica,\n[https://www.britannica.com/place/Egypt Egypt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708222509/https://www.britannica.com/place/Egypt |date=8 July 2019 }}, britannica.com, USA, accessed on 7 July 2019</ref> There are also [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], [[Coptic Catholic Church]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Evangelical Church of Egypt (Synod of the Nile)]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]).\n\n{{Multiple image\n|align =right\n|direction=vertical\n|header =Places of worship in Alexandria\n|header_align=center\n|width =180\n|image1 =Mezquita abu el abbas-alejandria-2007.JPG\n|alt1  =\n|caption1 =[[El-Mursi Abul Abbas Mosque]]\n|image2 =StCatherineChurchAlexandria.jpg\n|alt2  =\n|caption2 =[[Latin Church|Latin Catholic]] church of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] in Mansheya\n|image3 =Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue in Alexandria.jpg\n|alt3  =\n|caption3 =[[Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue (Alexandria)|Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue]]\n}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also|List of mosques in Alexandria}}\nThe most famous mosque in Alexandria is [[Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque]] in [[Bahary]].

The [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]] was second only to the [[bishop of Rome]], the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] until 430. The [[Church of Alexandria]] had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, the Church of Alexandria was split between the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] and the [[Melkite]]s. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. In the 19th century, [[Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\n\nToday, the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Alexandria)|Saint Mark Cathedral]] in Ramleh. The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include [[Cyril of Alexandria|Pope Cyril I]] Church in Cleopatra, [[Saint George]]s Church in Sporting, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] & [[Pope Peter I of Alexandria|Pope Peter I]] Church in Sidi Bishr, [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Saint Mary]] Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, [[Saint Menas|Saint Mina]] Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and [[St. Takla Haymanot's Church (Alexandria)|Saint Takla Haymanot's Church]] in Ibrahimeya.\n\nThe most important [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches in Alexandria are [[Holy Unmercenaries|Agioi An\u00e1rgyroi]] Church, Church of the [[Annunciation]], [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]] Church, [[Gabriel|Archangels Gabriel]] & [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] Church, Taxiarchon Church, [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] Church, Cathedral of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]] in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, [[Elijah|Prophet Elijah]] Church, [[Saint George]] Church, [[Saint Joseph]] Church in Fleming, [[Joseph of Arimathea|Saint Joseph of Arimathea]] Church, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] & [[Nectarios of Aegina|Saint Nektarios]] Chapel in Ramleh, [[Saint Nicholas]] Church, [[Paraskevi of Rome|Saint Paraskevi]] Church, [[Saint Sava]] Cathedral in Ramleh, [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore]] Chapel and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] church of [[Alexander Nevsky|Saint Alexander Nevsky]] in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\n\nThe [[Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said]] has jurisdiction over all [[Latin Church]] Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its [[Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan]], which uses the [[Byzantine Rite]], and the nominal see of the [[Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria]] (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the [[Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia]], using the [[Armenian Rite]].\n\nThe Saint Mark Church in [[Shatby]], founded as part of [[Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Alexandria|Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc]], is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] and Coptic Orthodox rites.\n\nIn antiquity, Alexandria was a major center of the cosmopolitan religious movement called [[Gnosticism]] (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\n===Judaism===\n[[File:Egyptian Alexandria Jewish girls during BatMitzva.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish girls during [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bat Mitzva]] in Alexandria]]\n{{see also|History of the Jews in Egypt}}\nAlexandria's once-flourishing Jewish community declined rapidly following the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], after which negative reactions towards [[Zionism]] among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt fled to the newly established [[Israel]], [[France]], [[Brazil]] and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50.<ref>[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/12/20/2742246/egypt-plans-to-restore-alexandrias-historic-synagogue Egypt to restore Alexandria's historic synagogue], (20 December 2010) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224165555/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/12/20/2742246/egypt-plans-to-restore-alexandrias-historic-synagogue |date=24 December 2010 }}</ref> The most important [[synagogue]] in Alexandria is the [[Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue (Alexandria)|Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue]].\n\n==Education==\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n[[File:Saint-Marc Alexandria.jpg|thumb|[[Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Alexandria|Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc]]]]\nAlexandria has a number of higher education institutions. [[Alexandria University]] is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its [[Alexandria Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]] & [[Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University|Faculty of Engineering]]. In addition, the [[Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology]] in [[New Borg El Arab]] city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010.  The [[Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport]] is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC [[American University in Cairo]] because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. [[Senghor University|Universit\u00e9 Senghor]] is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly recruits students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include [[Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering and Technology|Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT)]] and [[Pharos University in Alexandria]].\n\n===Schools===\n[[File:Lycee Francais d'Alexandrie 2001.JPG|thumb|[[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais d'Alexandrie]]]]\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by [[Catholic]] missionaries include [[Coll\u00e8ge de la M\u00e8re de Dieu]], Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Sion, [[Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc, Alexandria|Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc]], Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), \u00c9cole Girard, \u00c9cole Saint Gabriel, \u00c9cole Saint-Vincent de Paul, \u00c9cole Saint Joseph, \u00c9cole Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lyc\u00e9e el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais d'Alexandrie (\u00c9cole Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the [[Istituto \"Don Bosco\"]].\n\nEnglish schools in Alexandria are becoming the most popular. English-language schools in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, [[British School of Alexandria]], Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, [[Schutz American School, Alexandria|Schutz American School]], [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]], [[Manar English Girls School|El Manar Language School for Girls]] (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and [[El Nasr Girls' College]].\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are [[Deutsche Schule der Borrom\u00e4erinnen Alexandria|Deutsche Schule der Borrom\u00e4rinnen]] (DSB of Saint Charles Borrom\u00e9) and [[Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam]].\n\nThe [[Montessori education|Montessori]] educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at [[Alexandria Montessori]].\n\nThe most notable public schools in Alexandria include El Abbassia High School and Gamal Abdel Nasser High School.\n\n===Women===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\nCirca the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to the same percentage in Cairo.

The commuter line's [[locomotive]]s operate on [[diesel locomotive|diesel]], as opposed to the [[railway electrification system#Overhead systems|overhead-electric]] tram.\n\nAlexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned [[Misr Station]] (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and [[Sidi Gaber railway station]] (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the center of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by [[Egyptian National Railways]].\n\n===Trams===\n{{Main|Trams in Alexandria}}\n[[File:The yellow tram passing through Saad Zaghloul's square.jpg|thumb|An Alexandria tram]]\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the [[Mahatet El Raml|El Raml district]] in the west and ends in the [[Victoria (neighborhood)|Victoria district]] in the east. Most of the vehicles are blue in color. Some smaller yellow-colored vehicles have further routes beyond the two main endpoints. The tram routes have one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, and 6. All four start at El Raml, but only two (1 and 2) reach Victoria. There are two converging and diverging points. The first starts at [[Bolkly]] (Isis) and ends at [[San Stefano (neighborhood)|San Stefano]]. The other begins at [[Sporting (neighborhood)|Sporting]] and ends at Mostafa Kamel. Route 5 starts at San Stefano and takes the inner route to Bolkly. Route 6 starts at Sidi Gaber El Sheikh in the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 1 takes the inner route between San Stefano and Bolkly and the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 2 takes the route opposite to Route 1 in both these areas. The tram fares are 50 piastres (0.50 pounds), and 100 piastres (1.00 pounds) for the middle car. Some trams (that date back the 30s) charge a pound. The tram is considered the cheapest method of public transport. A caf\u00e9 operates in the second floor of the first car of tram 1 (a women-only car) which costs 5 L.E per person, also offering a WiFi service. A luxury light blue tram car operates from San Stefano to Ras El Tin, with free WiFi and movies and songs played inside for 5 L.E per ticket.\n\n'''Stations:'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n# Baccos \u2013 Victoria (Number 1)\n# Al Seyouf\n# Sidi Beshr\n# El Saraya\n# Laurent Louran\n# Tharwat\n# San Stefano\n# Gianaklis\n# Schutz\n# Safar\n# Abou Shabana (Baccos)\n# Al Karnak (Fleming)\n# Al Wezara (The Ministry)\n# Isis Bolkly Bulkley\n# Roushdy\n# Mohammed Mahfouz\n# Mustafa Kamil\n# Sidi Gaber Al-Sheikh\n# Cleopatra Hammamat (Cleopatra Baths)\n# Cleopatra El Soghra\n# El Reyada El Kobra (Sporting El Kobra)\n# El Reyada El Soghra (Sporting Al Soghra)\n# Al Ibrahimiyya\n# El Moaskar (Camp Caesar)\n# Al Gamaa (The University)\n# Al Shatby\n# El Shobban El Moslemin\n# El Shahid Moustafa Ziean\n# Hassan Rasim (Azarita)\n# Gamea' Ibrahim (Mosque of Ibrahim)\n# Mahattet Al Ramleh (Ramlh Station)\n{{div col end}}\n'''Route 2 serves:'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n# El Nasr \u2013 Victoria (Number 2)\n# Al Seyouf\n# Sidi Beshr\n# El Saraya\n# Louran\n# Tharwat\n# San Stefano\n# Kasr El Safa (Zizini Al Safa Palace)\n# Al Fonoun Al Gamella (The Fine Arts)\n# Ramsis (Glym or Gleem)\n# El Bostan (Saba Pasha)\n# Al Hedaya (The Guidance)\n# Isis Bolkly\n# Roushdy\n# Mohammed Mahfouz\n# Mustafa Kamil\n# Sidi Gaber El Mahata (Railway station)\n# Cleopatra (Zananere)\n# El Reyada El Kobra (Sporting El Kobra)\n# El Reyada El Soghra (Sporting Al Soghra)\n# Al Ibrahimiyya\n# El Moaskar (Camp Chezar)\n# Al Gamaa (The University)\n# Al Shatby\n# El Shobban El Moslemin\n# El Shahid Moustafa Ziean\n# Hassan Rasim (Azarita)\n# Gamea' Ibrahim (Mosque of Ibrahim)\n# Mahattet Al Ramlh (Ramlh Station)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Metro===\nConstruction of the [[Alexandria Metro]] is due to begin in 2020 at a cost of $1.05 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://meconstructionnews.com/37864/egypts-1bn-alexandria-metro-to-start-construction-in-q1-2020|title=Egypt's $1bn Alexandria Metro to start construction in Q1 2020|website=Middle East Construction News|date=10 November 2019|accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Taxis and minibuses===\n{{see also|Taxicabs by country#Egypt}}\nTaxis in Alexandria sport a yellow-and-black [[livery]] and are widely available.

Some drivers also drive only a segment of a route rather than the whole path; such drivers generally stop at a point known as a major hub of the transportation system (for example, Victoria) to allow riders to transfer to another car or to another mode of transport.\n\nFare is generally L.E. 3.00 to travel the whole route. Shorter trips may have a lower fare, depending on the driver and the length of the trip.\n\n==Culture==\n===Libraries===\n[[File:Bibliotheca Alexandrina plaza 003.jpg|thumb|The [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]\nThe Royal [[Library of Alexandria]], in Alexandria, [[Egypt]], was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II of Egypt]]. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the [[Muse]]s\u2014the [[Musaeum|Museion]], Greek ''\u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03bd'' (from which the [[Modern English]] word ''[[Museum#Etymology|museum]]'' is derived).\n\nIt has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming).

It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and [[Egypt]]. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria.

The Kom el shoqafa Catacombs are considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages and date back to the 2nd century. The remnants of Pompey's Pillar still remain today. This single pillar represents the elaborate temple which once stood in Alexandria. It remains at the site of the Serapeum, Alexandria's acropolis. The Serapeum, which stood for ancient tradition, conflicted with the rise of Christianity. It is a large tourist destination, today. the Roman Amphitheatre of Alexandria is another popular destination. Here, there remains a stage with around seven hundred to eight hundred seats.

[[Alexandria Stadium]] is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in Alexandria, [[Egypt]]. It is currently used mostly for football matches, and was used for the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006 African Cup of Nations]]. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the [[Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations]] in January 2006, which [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] won. Sea sports such as [[surfing]], [[Personal water craft|jet-skiing]] and [[water polo]] are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the [[Alexandria Sporting Club]], which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the [[Egypt national basketball team|country's national team]] with key players. The city hosted the [[AfroBasket]], the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).\n\nAlexandria has four [[stadium]]s:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Alexandria Stadium]]\n*[[Borg El Arab Stadium]]\n*El Krom Stadium\n*[[Harras El Hodoud Stadium]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nOther less popular sports like tennis and [[squash (sport)|squash]] are usually played in private [[Social club|social]] and [[sports club]]s, like:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Acacia Country Club\n*Alexandria Sporting Club \u2013 in \"[[Sporting, Alexandria, Egypt|Sporting]]\"\n*Alexandria Country club\n*[[Al Ittihad Alexandria Club]]\n*[[Olympic Club (Egypt)|Olympic Club]]\n*[[Haras El Hodoud SC]] Club\n*[[Koroum]] Club\n*Lagoon Resort Courts\n*[[Smouha SC]] \u2013 in \"[[Smouha]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n\nStarted in 2011, [[Cross Egypt Challenge]] is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt.
