Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in {{nobr|October 2017.}} While waiting for dinner, he observed that the other patrons were all staring at a television while an episode of [[The Mask Singer (season 3)|third season]] of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. Plestis then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night telling him he needed to come in the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend.

As a result, the [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|first season]]  was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]], then-owned partly by Fox's parent company [[21st Century Fox]] (the stake is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]) due to Plestis' relationship with the studio.

Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than panelists who could create a comedic tone for the show; one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for choosing to appear. Jeong was the first panelist to be signed on to the series due to his humour and pre-existing knowledge of the South Korean version, followed by McCarthy Wahlberg, Thicke, and Scherzinger.<ref name=\"E!

She said many of the celebrities had emotional reactions when presented with the proposed costumes and that they were excited about using the show as a way of reinventing their [[reputation|public image]].

As a result of the political unrest, the country faced difficultly in creating a high functioning tourism industry. Though the numbers indicate there was active tourism, it was not expansive and faced hardships as a result of the politics of the period.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grundlingh|first=Albert|date=30 Mar 2009|title=Revisiting the 'Old' South Africa: Excursions into South Africa's Tourist History under Apartheid, 1948\u20131990|journal=Revisiting the 'Old' South Africa: Excursions into South Africa's Tourist History Under Apartheid 1948-1990|volume=56|pages=103\u2013122|doi=10.1080/02582470609464967}}</ref>\n\n=== 1994 - Present ===\nIn the years following the democratic elections of 1994, South Africa opened its tourism horizons by hosting a variety of world wide events including the 1995 Rugby World Cup, and the 2010 World Cup.

Researchers have cited logistical and political reasons as to why the bid failed. For example, Cape Town was behind in the necessary means to support an event the size of the Olympics financially. Political reasons were also prevalent in the eventual failure of the bid as the committee was all white and the motive to create a national identity seemed like a false promise to the majority black population of South Africa. The Bid Committee had issues of reconciliation and accusations of racism specifically between Raymond Ackerman, a wealthy white man who led the bid, and Sam Ramsamy who was of Indian descent. Therefore, in an attempt to enhance the tourism industry through an Olympics bid, the challenge of cohesive action posed a great threat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Masuku|first=Philele|date=October 2004|title=South Africa's Bid for the 2004 Olympic Games as Means for International Unity and International Awareness|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/79df/39990840f517842d1e711bb0b15fe106b15f.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \n\nThe Fifa World Cup of 2010 is an example of a more successful route by South Africa to increase tourism and influence the nation positively. Firstly, the event helped to bolster South Africa\u2019s global brand and image. One of the main objectives in South Africa\u2019s attempt to host such events was to positively influence its national identity and erase the negative image of apartheid set forth prior to the nation\u2019s gradual shift to become the self-proclaimed \u201cRainbow Nation.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOther examples of tourism positively benefitting South Africa generally have an underlying theme of supporting the cohesion of the nation following years of separation based on race. Some examples of the nation reinventing itself through the tourism industry include the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg, District Six Museum in Cape Town, and former prisons turned into powerful museums such as Constitution Hill and Robben Island which now attract tourists every year.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rankin|first=Elizabeth|date=21 March 2013|title=Creating/Curating Cultural Capital: Monuments and Museums for Post-Apartheid South Africa|url=|journal=Humanities|volume=2|pages=|via=Taylor & Francis Online}}</ref>\n\nTourism in South Africa has not fully been inviting to the majority of people and reflects the legacy of apartheid that is internalized to this day. [[Township (South Africa)|Townships]], such as Alexandra, were hubs of black communities during the apartheid. After the period of apartheid, townships face the remnants of segregation including overcrowding, unemployment, and crime. However, places such as Alexandra have become part of an initiative of \u2018township tourism.\u2019 The concept is meant to develop these townships by inviting tourists into the history of the locations and as a means to celebrate such places of culture.\u00a0 \u201c...The phenomenon of township tourism has opened up new tourism spaces in South Africa in the post-apartheid period and involves visits to symbolic sites of significance in the anti-apartheid struggle as well as enhancing the understanding of poverty in historically oppressed communities.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Rogerson|first=Christian|date=July 2004|title=Transforming the South African tourism industry: The emerging black-owned bed and breakfast economy|url=|journal=GeoJournal|volume=60|pages=|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Additionally, township tourism is a strategy by the South African government to promote black establishments. One marker of post-apartheid tourism is the movement to bolster black economic empowerment. Some researchers claim that this consumption by tourists of township culture could be at the expense of local residents.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe reason for this breakage between the people in South Africa can be linked to policies during the apartheid restricting blacks from current tourist destinations and a general feeling of otherness by blacks that exists today. It\u2019s not a controversial concept, however, as the civil society and South African members of the tourism private sector have supported the argument that Apartheid \u201c..contributed to the lack of participation in domestic tourism by the youth,\u201d specifically.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Dzikiti|first=Lianda|date=|title=Barriers towards African youth participation in domestic tourism in post-apartheid South Africa: The case of Alexandra Township, Johannesburg|url=https://www.ajhtl.com/.|journal=African Journal of Hospitality, Tourism, and Leisure|volume=5|pages=|via=}}</ref> Research has proven that blacks once effected by the apartheid still have that feeling of disconnect.

Naturally occurring issues related to the environment and social issues such as crime rates are contributing factors to the nation\u2019s tourism decline.

These establishments mainly exist in former \u201cblack spaces\u201d also known as townships. These bed and breakfast locations mainly benefit from domestic tourism in South Africa. The rise in these establishments\u2019 significance is that the national government is increasingly looking to bolster black economic empowerment and the general structure of ownership of the tourism industry. \u201cThe first decade of the post-apartheid government has witnessed a number of steps taken towards policy framework and strategic development for transformation.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> However, black owners of these establishments highlights the issues that exist still in the successful establishment and growth of tourism in this sector.

As a result of the political unrest, the country faced difficultly in creating a high functioning tourism industry. Though the numbers indicate there was active tourism, it was not expansive and faced hardships as a result of the politics of the period.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grundlingh|first=Albert|date=30 Mar 2009|title=Revisiting the 'Old' South Africa: Excursions into South Africa's Tourist History under Apartheid, 1948\u20131990|journal=Revisiting the 'Old' South Africa: Excursions into South Africa's Tourist History Under Apartheid 1948-1990|volume=56|pages=103\u2013122|doi=10.1080/02582470609464967}}</ref>\n\n=== 1994 - Present ===\nIn the years following the democratic elections of 1994, South Africa opened its tourism horizons by hosting a variety of world wide events including the 1995 Rugby World Cup, and the 2010 World Cup. The hosting of these events helped bolster South Africa\u2019s image and national identity.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Giesler|first=Josh|date=|title=Re-Imagining the South African Nation: Case Studies of the 1995 Rugby World Cup and the 2010 FIFA World Cup|url=http://scarab.bates.edu/honorstheses/176|journal=Undergraduate Research Commons|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nSouth Africa, however, failed in an attempt to host the 2004 Olympics. Researchers have cited logistical and political reasons as to why the bid failed. For example, Cape Town was behind in the necessary means to support an event the size of the Olympics financially. Political reasons were also prevalent in the eventual failure of the bid as the committee was all white and the motive to create a national identity seemed like a false promise to the majority black population of South Africa. The Bid Committee had issues of reconciliation and accusations of racism specifically between Raymond Ackerman, a wealthy white man who led the bid, and Sam Ramsamy who was of Indian descent. Therefore, in an attempt to enhance the tourism industry through an Olympics bid, the challenge of cohesive action posed a great threat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Masuku|first=Philele|date=October 2004|title=South Africa's Bid for the 2004 Olympic Games as Means for International Unity and International Awareness|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/79df/39990840f517842d1e711bb0b15fe106b15f.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \n\nThe Fifa World Cup of 2010 is an example of a more successful route by South Africa to increase tourism and influence the nation positively. Firstly, the event helped to bolster South Africa\u2019s global brand and image. One of the main objectives in South Africa\u2019s attempt to host such events was to positively influence its national identity and erase the negative image of apartheid set forth prior to the nation\u2019s gradual shift to become the self-proclaimed \u201cRainbow Nation.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOther examples of tourism positively benefitting South Africa generally have an underlying theme of supporting the cohesion of the nation following years of separation based on race. Some examples of the nation reinventing itself through the tourism industry include the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg, District Six Museum in Cape Town, and former prisons turned into powerful museums such as Constitution Hill and Robben Island which now attract tourists every year.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rankin|first=Elizabeth|date=21 March 2013|title=Creating/Curating Cultural Capital: Monuments and Museums for Post-Apartheid South Africa|url=|journal=Humanities|volume=2|pages=|via=Taylor & Francis Online}}</ref>\n\nTourism in South Africa has not fully been inviting to the majority of people and reflects the legacy of apartheid that is internalized to this day. [[Township (South Africa)|Townships]], such as Alexandra, were hubs of black communities during the apartheid. After the period of apartheid, townships face the remnants of segregation including overcrowding, unemployment, and crime. However, places such as Alexandra have become part of an initiative of \u2018township tourism.\u2019 The concept is meant to develop these townships by inviting tourists into the history of the locations and as a means to celebrate such places of culture.\u00a0 \u201c...The phenomenon of township tourism has opened up new tourism spaces in South Africa in the post-apartheid period and involves visits to symbolic sites of significance in the anti-apartheid struggle as well as enhancing the understanding of poverty in historically oppressed communities.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Rogerson|first=Christian|date=July 2004|title=Transforming the South African tourism industry: The emerging black-owned bed and breakfast economy|url=|journal=GeoJournal|volume=60|pages=|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Additionally, township tourism is a strategy by the South African government to promote black establishments. One marker of post-apartheid tourism is the movement to bolster black economic empowerment. Some researchers claim that this consumption by tourists of township culture could be at the expense of local residents.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe reason for this breakage between the people in South Africa can be linked to policies during the apartheid restricting blacks from current tourist destinations and a general feeling of otherness by blacks that exists today. It\u2019s not a controversial concept, however, as the civil society and South African members of the tourism private sector have supported the argument that Apartheid \u201c..contributed to the lack of participation in domestic tourism by the youth,\u201d specifically.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Dzikiti|first=Lianda|date=|title=Barriers towards African youth participation in domestic tourism in post-apartheid South Africa: The case of Alexandra Township, Johannesburg|url=https://www.ajhtl.com/.|journal=African Journal of Hospitality, Tourism, and Leisure|volume=5|pages=|via=}}</ref> Research has proven that blacks once effected by the apartheid still have that feeling of disconnect. Black youth, specifically, who experience poverty among other issues deem tourism and travel to other parts of their own country as a white dominated activity.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nToday, South Africa\u2019s tourism industry appears to be on a decline. Naturally occurring issues related to the environment and social issues such as crime rates are contributing factors to the nation\u2019s tourism decline. This decline, however, is a dangerous entity given the importance of tourism for the economic growth of the nation and its continual efforts to rebrand the nation following the historic period of apartheid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/travel/tourism-in-south-africa-on-the-decline-2019/|title=Statistics show that the South African tourism sector is in decline|date=2019-05-27|website=The South African|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Black Owned Establishments ===\nAn emergence of black owned bed and breakfast establishments is a new phenomenon in the South African tourism industry that is a direct linkage to the legacy of the apartheid. These establishments mainly exist in former \u201cblack spaces\u201d also known as townships. These bed and breakfast locations mainly benefit from domestic tourism in South Africa. The rise in these establishments\u2019 significance is that the national government is increasingly looking to bolster black economic empowerment and the general structure of ownership of the tourism industry. \u201cThe first decade of the post-apartheid government has witnessed a number of steps taken towards policy framework and strategic development for transformation.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> However, black owners of these establishments highlights the issues that exist still in the successful establishment and growth of tourism in this sector. Black entrepreneurs, and owners of such establishments still seek the government\u2019s help to improve in fields such as finance, training,\u00a0and \u201caccess to available support networks of business information and advice.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n<br />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of South African tourist attractions]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikivoyage|South Africa}}\n* [http://www.southafrica.net/ Official Tourism Website]\n* [http://www.tourism.gov.za/Pages/Home.aspx South African National Department of Tourism]\n\n{{Economy of South Africa}}\n{{South Africa topics}}\n{{Tourism in Africa}}\n\n[[Category:Tourism in South Africa| ]]\n[[Category:Tourism in Africa by country|South Africa]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_South_Africa"}

Some of the most popular airlines are [[LAN Per\u00fa]] (domestic and international), [[Avianca Peru]] (international), and [[Star Per\u00fa]] (domestic). The country's airports are also served by many international airlines from other nations. The [[Jorge Ch\u00e1vez International Airport]] in Lima is the nation's leading international airport and received 15,295,808 passengers in 2013. Domestic air travel serves as a major method for tourists to traverse the country with multiple airlines offering service between many of Peru's cities.\n\n=== Highways ===\nPeru has land borders with five countries and has highway connections with all but [[Colombia]]. International bus routes are operated on each of these highways providing service from Peruvian cities to other South American cities. Domestically, the highway system is extensive and covers nearly the entire country excluding the [[Loreto Region|department of Loreto]] which can only be accessed by boat or airplane. There are frequent buses traveling throughout the country. But, bus travel is dangerous as many of these highways are built on cliffs, and accidents leading to death are frequently reported by the media. Occasionally buses are held up by [[highwayman|highwaymen]] in remote areas. The buses range in size and comfort but they usually have cushioned reclining seats and a form of onboard entertainment, such as a movie or music. Many offer bus-''camas'', or sleeper buses, with seats that recline to become beds.\n\n=== Rail ===\n[[File:PeruRail_MLW_DL560D_653_Urubamba_river_bridge_Sicuani.jpg|thumb|A [[PeruRail]] tourist train Puno-Cusco]]The [[Lima Metro]] is partially complete, with one line operational, but other regions do not have this system. Tourists must travel by bus or taxi within the city. Outside of Lima, there are only two major railway systems in operation, one in the central part of the country and the other in the south. The central railway starts at sea level in Lima and traverses the [[Andes]], crossing through the [[Jun\u00edn Region|Jun\u00edn]] and [[Huancavelica Region|Huancavelica]] [[Regions of Peru|departments]].\n\nThe southern railway is the one most commonly used by tourists, as a segment of its route goes from the city of [[Cusco]] to the citadel of [[Machu Picchu]], a major tourist attraction. This route offers seating options ranging from economy class to first class. The railway originates in the city of [[Mollendo]] in the [[Arequipa Region]] and goes through the [[Puno Region|Puno]] and [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] regions, passing through the cities of [[Arequipa]], [[Puno]], [[Juliaca]], the citadel of Machu Picchu, and ends at Cusco. The railway is operated by [[PeruRail]], the largest railway manager in Peru. A newer railway, IncaRail, also takes tourists from nearby cities to [[Aguas Calientes, Peru|Aguas Calientes]] at the bottom of Machu Picchu.\n[[File:Amazon River Taxi.jpg|thumb|River taxi on the [[Amazon River]]]]\n\n=== River ===\nAnother mode of transportation in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] area is river transport. River transportation companies operate routes between the cities of the [[Peruvian Amazon]]. The main hubs of this network are the cities of [[Iquitos]], [[Puerto Maldonado]], [[Pucallpa]], and [[Yurimaguas]]. Because of the lack of roads in this region, river transport, along with air travel, are the most efficient and important methods of transport.\n\n== Data ==\nTourism is the third largest industry in Peru.<ref name=\"eleconomista\" /> It employs 11% of the labor force in Peru (484,000 direct and 340,000 indirect jobs) the majority of them belonging to the hotel and transportation industries. The industry makes up 7% of the Peruvian gross domestic product and is the fastest growing industry in the country.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} It is regulated by the Commission for the Promotion of Peru (PromPeru) belonging to the [[Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Tourism (Peru)|Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Tourism]].\n\nIn 2000, about 1 million tourists visited Peru that year, with tourist activity increasing due to the decrease of guerrilla activity.<ref name=\"FTWD2\">{{cite book|title=[[Financial Times]] World Desk Reference|last1=Heritage|first1=Andrew|date=December 2002|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=|isbn=9780789488053|location=|pages=462\u2013465}}</ref> By 2017, more than 4 million tourists were visiting the country annually.<ref name=\"mincetur\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mincetur.gob.pe/centro_de_Informacion/mapa_interactivo.htm|title=Llegada de Turistas Internacionales 2011-2017|last=|first=|date=April 2018|website=[[Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Tourism (Peru)|Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Tourism of Peru]]|access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Arrivals by country ===\n\nMost visitors arriving in Peru on a short-term basis in 2017 were from the following countries by nationality:<ref name=\"mincetur\" />\n[[File:Tourists at Inti Punku.jpg|thumb|Tourists and guides at [[Inti Punku]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Pre-Columbian civilizations&nbsp;\u2013 most notably the [[Inca Empire]], [[Chav\u00edn culture|Chav\u00edn]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], and [[Nazca culture|Nasca]]&nbsp;\u2013 left a large archeological and cultural impact on the nation. The ruins of [[Machu Picchu]] are the most internationally recognized of all the ruins of Peru and therefore receive the most tourists. The other popular ruins are those of [[Chan Chan]], [[Sip\u00e1n]], [[Kuelap]], [[Nazca Lines]], [[Ollantaytambo]], [[Caral]], [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n]], and [[Sillustani]].\n\nTourists also visit the Spanish colonial architecture in many cities in Peru. Some of the most outstanding examples of Spanish colonial architecture are in the cities of Lima, [[Arequipa]], and Cusco. These areas, many built over 500 years ago, demonstrate the superb architectural ingenuity of the colonists during the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. The city of Lima has many acclaimed museums holding works of art reflecting the diverse history of the country. These museums include the National Museum, National Museum of Anthropology, Archeology and History; Rafael Larco Herrera Archeological Museum, National Museum of Peruvian Culture, and Museum of Italian Art, among many others. There are also many museums outside Lima, including the [[Regional Museum of the National University of San Martin]] in Tarapoto, [[San Mart\u00edn Province|San Martin]].\n\n=== Ecotourism ===\n[[File:Gocta.jpg|thumb|[[Gocta Cataracts]] near [[Chachapoyas, Peru]]]]\n60% of the land of Peru is in the [[Amazon Basin]], and 74% of the land is covered by the Amazon rainforest itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecotourism.org/peru|title=Peru {{!}} The International Ecotourism Society|website=www.ecotourism.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref> Peru has a higher percentage of land area protected in national parks and reserves than any other country in South America. The [[Peruvian Amazon]] is one of the most pristine, virgin, and untouched rainforests on the earth, making it a destination for tourists interested in nature and ecology; this has prompted increased  tourist infrastructure. Despite this land coverage, nearly 1 million hectares and counting of the rainforest has been decimated between 2001\u20132015 with the following main causes: [[deforestation]] and [[soil degradation]], small and medium-scale agriculture, large-scale agriculture, pasture for livestock, [[gold mining]], coca cultivation, and [[road construction]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://maaproject.org/2017/maap-sintesis2/|title=MAAP S\u00cdNTESIS #2: PATRONES Y DRIVERS DE DEFORESTACI\u00d3N EN LA...|last=Finer|first=Matt|date=2017-02-14|work=MAAP|access-date=2018-02-06|language=es-ES}}</ref> The Amazon's innate beauty and its continuous destruction altogether draw tourists to Peru through ecotourism and environmental voluntourism.\n[[File:Huascar\u00e1n.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|[[Huascar\u00e1n]], Peru's tallest point]]\nThe Peruvian Amazon is divided into two areas: the High Jungle and the Lower Jungle. The High Jungle is more easily accessible, while the Lower Jungle is more pristine and untouched. In recent times, however, the government has increased accessibility to the Lower Jungle. Both areas contain an unrivaled diversity of animal and plant life. Large [[List of national parks in Peru|national preserves]] of interest to tourists include the [[Man\u00fa National Park]], [[Rio Abiseo National Park]], Pacaya Samiria National Reserve, and the [[Tambopata-Candamo]] Protected Area. Tourist agencies in these areas promote eco-friendly tourism to preserve the fragile ecosystems of the rainforest.\n\nIn the [[\u00c1ncash Region]], tourists also experience the mountainous terrain of the [[Andes]]. The region has two mountain ranges of the Andes; the [[Cordillera Negra]], a dark line of mountains without any glacial peaks and the [[Cordillera Blanca]], a line of snowcapped mountains with [[glacier]]s. [[Huascar\u00e1n]], the tallest point in Peru and the fourth highest mountain in the Americas. The region also hosts [[Huascar\u00e1n National Park]], which holds biodiversity of various flora and fauna, being a [[World Heritage Site]] since 1985.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.parkswatch.org/parkprofiles/pdf/hunp_spa.pdf|title=Parque Nacional Huascar\u00e1n (in Spanish)|date=|website=parkswatch.org|publisher=Parkswatch|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=== Adventure tourism ===\nBecause of Peru's geographical diversity, it is possible to go [[surfing]], [[sandboarding]], [[4x4]], [[dune buggy]], [[alpinism]], [[rafting]], [[rappelling]], [[Alpine skiing|downhill]], [[rallying|rally]], [[backpacking (wilderness)|trekking]], [[skiing]], and [[mountain climbing]]. Surfing is extremely popular in Peru, and the country has been host to numerous national and international competitions in the sport. The country is home to the world-famous surfer [[Sof\u00eda Mul\u00e1novich]].\n\nPeru is divided into three geographical regions: the coast, the sierra, and the jungle. Each one has numerous activities suited to its particular climate and environment. The sport of skiing is developing in the city of [[Huaraz]], and new resorts are created to suit the rising tourist demand. The sand dunes of [[Ica Region|Ica]] are popular for dune buggies. River rafting has become very popular among national and international tourists in recent years, and availability in Lima and [[Cusco]] is high. Rapids range in difficulty and there are rafting options from novices to experts. Trekking has become the most popular type of adventure sport among tourists in Peru. This is because of the treks offered from Cusco to [[Machu Picchu]], as well as trails in other parts of the country such as [[Ancash Region|Ancash]]. Mountain climbing is a popular sport among tourists in the sierra region.\n\nFor more information on adventure tourism see the Ancash section of this article below.\n\n=== Gastronomic tourism ===\n{{See also|Peruvian cuisine}}\n[[File:Ceviche del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|[[Ceviche]] is a popular Peruvian seafood dish.]]\n'''Peruvian cuisine''' stems mainly from the combination of Spanish cuisine with traditional native Peruvian ingredients, with later influences from the cuisines of China, Italy, West Africa and Japan, due to the arrival of immigrants from those locations. Each of these cuisines has had to be heavily adapted because of a lack or scarcity of many ingredients. For example, it is still impossible to find such commonplace items as lemons, [[turnip]]s, [[kale]] and [[chestnut]]s in Peru. It is next to impossible to find authentic foreign cuisine to this day because of a lack of ingredients. For example, one can not find authentic Chinese dishes such as [[Mapo dofu]]. Instead one finds a mixture of Chinese cooking that has been adapted to the ingredients available in Peru known as [[Chifa]].\n\nThe three traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are corn, potatoes and beans. These ingredients have been combined with a number of staples brought by the Spanish, such as rice, wheat and meat (such as beef, pork and chicken). Many traditional foods, such as [[quinoa]], [[kiwicha]], [[chili pepper]]s and several roots and tubers which had previously been tossed aside for European products, have seen a resurgence in popularity in recent decades with a revival of interest in native Peruvian food crops.\n\nTraditional foods in the coast, mountains, and jungle are markedly different from each other. Because of this, the local gastronomy depends greatly on what part of Peru one visits.<ref>https://gringoinca.com/food-to-try-in-peru/</ref>\n\n=== Beach tourism ===\nPeru boasts a 2,414-kilometer coastline littered with many beaches attractive to any type of traveler. Beachgoing in Peru is extremely popular among domestic and international travelers alike. Beach resorts and towns are abundant along the coast and many are in popular areas which attract visitors. Two of the most popular beach areas are [[M\u00e1ncora]] and [[Punta Sal]] in the [[Piura Region|Piura]] and [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]] regions respectively, and [[Asia District, Peru|Asia]] in the [[Lima Department]].\n\nThe northern beaches of M\u00e1ncora and Punta Sal have a pleasant beach climate year round whereas Asia is primarily a summertime beach. Because Asia is located near the city of Lima, many beachgoers own houses in that area. In contrast, M\u00e1ncora is many hours from major cities so visitors usually stay in hotels or resorts.\n\n[[File:Mancorabeach1.jpg|thumb|A beach in [[M\u00e1ncora]], [[Piura Region]]]]\nBeachgoing in Peru is affected by fads: Beach homeowners moved from beach to beach resulting from the oversaturation of one beach. In previous years, the beach of [[Anc\u00f3n District|Anc\u00f3n]] was the most popular of Lima; it became oversaturated and beachgoers moved south of the city to the beaches of [[Punta Hermosa District|Punta Hermosa]], [[San Bartolo District|San Bartolo]], [[Santa Mar\u00eda District, Huaura|Santa Maria]] and [[Pucusana District|Pucusana]]. In the last decade, these beaches have become oversaturated as well and beachgoers have moved further south to the development of Asia, which has now become extremely popular and is the primary beach destination for Limeans.\n\nM\u00e1ncora, 17 hours north of Lima by bus and 1.5 hours by plane from [[Talara]], is older than Asia but still a relatively new development. In recent years it has experienced a tourist boom and beachgoers flock there. Its beaches have white sand and the town has many nightclubs and bars frequented by thousands of tourists. The popularity of this beach has become so great that a movie has been made about the beach: ''M\u00e1ncora''. Punta Sal is another beach a half-hour north of Mancora, less popular among young people, and the destination for older people seeking relaxation. Nonetheless it remains a large tourist attraction and is characterized by its white sand beaches and turquoise color waters. Peruvian beaches are popular places for surfing and their waves are world-renowned.\n\nPeru is also a recognized location for surfing. In and around Lima there are surf options for tourists. On the northern coast is the town of Puerto Chicama, home to the longest left-breaking wave in the world at 1.4 miles (2.2 km).<ref>https://gringoinca.com/travel_tips_northern_peru/</ref>\n\n=== Luxury travel ===\nPeru has also been experiencing a continuous growth in luxury travel, particularly from around 2005 onwards.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This niche of tourists arrive seeking high-end hotels and premium experiences in unique destinations, and travel mainly from the U.S. and Europe, but increasingly also from Asian countries, particularly China. The main destinations of interest are [[Cusco]], [[Urubamba, Peru|Urubamba]], and [[Machu Picchu]]. Recently this segment has been expanding to other area such as the [[Puno Region]] and [[Lake Titicaca]], as well as [[Iquitos]] and the [[Colca Canyon]] in Arequipa, as the government, local authorities and local and international travel firms have made large investments in hotels, infrastructure and other tourism development.\n\nThe Peruvian government has made major efforts at securing international investment in the country's high-end tourism industry, particularly in emerging markets.<ref>[http://www.andina.com.pe/english/noticia-peru-to-promote-tourism-and-investment-at-itb-asia-trade-fair-431478.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017013352/http://www.andina.com.pe/english/noticia-peru-to-promote-tourism-and-investment-at-itb-asia-trade-fair-431478.aspx |date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> There are investors from major international hotel chains willing to invest millions of dollars (upwards of US$10 million) in 5 star hotels and resorts in the Mancora and Punta Sal area under capital investment or joint venture schemes.

third largest industry, behind fishing and mining.<ref name=turismo /> Tourism is directed towards archaeological monuments, ecotourism in the [[Peruvian Amazon]], [[cultural tourism]] in colonial cities, [[gastronomy|gastronomic]] tourism, adventure tourism, and beach tourism. According to a Peruvian government study, the satisfaction rate for tourists after visiting Peru is 94%.<ref>[http://travel.peru.com/travel/idocs/2005/4/26/DetalleDocumento_208731.asp Peru Travel \u2013 Peru.com \u2013 Trip to Peru, perfect vacation, tours to Per\u00fa, reservations, package tours, testimonials, hotels, restaurants, traveler's guide, tours, visas, transpo...] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923011408/http://travel.peru.com/travel/idocs/2005/4/26/DetalleDocumento_208731.asp |date=23 September 2007 }}</ref> Tourism is the most rapidly growing industry in Peru, growing annually at a rate of 25% over the past five years.<ref name=xinhuanet /> Tourism is growing in Peru faster than any other country in South America.<ref name=xinhuanet /> [[Iper\u00fa]] is the Peruvian national tourist office.\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n=== Air ===\n[[File:Airp0rt lima peru.jpg|thumb|[[Jorge Ch\u00e1vez International Airport]]]]\nPeru does not have one clear national airline,<ref name=lainsignia /> but rather a number of different airlines offering service to Peru from North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Some of the most popular airlines are [[LAN Per\u00fa]] (domestic and international), [[Avianca Peru]] (international), and [[Star Per\u00fa]] (domestic). The country's airports are also served by many international airlines from other nations. The [[Jorge Ch\u00e1vez International Airport]] in Lima is the nation's leading international airport and received 15,295,808 passengers in 2013. Domestic air travel serves as a major method for tourists to traverse the country with multiple airlines offering service between many of Peru's cities.\n\n=== Highways ===\nPeru has land borders with five countries and has highway connections with all but [[Colombia]]. International bus routes are operated on each of these highways providing service from Peruvian cities to other South American cities. Domestically, the highway system is extensive and covers nearly the entire country excluding the [[Loreto Region|department of Loreto]] which can only be accessed by boat or airplane. There are frequent buses traveling throughout the country. But, bus travel is dangerous as many of these highways are built on cliffs, and accidents leading to death are frequently reported by the media. Occasionally buses are held up by [[highwayman|highwaymen]] in remote areas. The buses range in size and comfort but they usually have cushioned reclining seats and a form of onboard entertainment, such as a movie or music. Many offer bus-''camas'', or sleeper buses, with seats that recline to become beds.\n\n=== Rail ===\n[[File:PeruRail_MLW_DL560D_653_Urubamba_river_bridge_Sicuani.jpg|thumb|A [[PeruRail]] tourist train Puno-Cusco]]The [[Lima Metro]] is partially complete, with one line operational, but other regions do not have this system. Tourists must travel by bus or taxi within the city. Outside of Lima, there are only two major railway systems in operation, one in the central part of the country and the other in the south. The central railway starts at sea level in Lima and traverses the [[Andes]], crossing through the [[Jun\u00edn Region|Jun\u00edn]] and [[Huancavelica Region|Huancavelica]] [[Regions of Peru|departments]].\n\nThe southern railway is the one most commonly used by tourists, as a segment of its route goes from the city of [[Cusco]] to the citadel of [[Machu Picchu]], a major tourist attraction. This route offers seating options ranging from economy class to first class. The railway originates in the city of [[Mollendo]] in the [[Arequipa Region]] and goes through the [[Puno Region|Puno]] and [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] regions, passing through the cities of [[Arequipa]], [[Puno]], [[Juliaca]], the citadel of Machu Picchu, and ends at Cusco. The railway is operated by [[PeruRail]], the largest railway manager in Peru. A newer railway, IncaRail, also takes tourists from nearby cities to [[Aguas Calientes, Peru|Aguas Calientes]] at the bottom of Machu Picchu.\n[[File:Amazon River Taxi.jpg|thumb|River taxi on the [[Amazon River]]]]\n\n=== River ===\nAnother mode of transportation in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] area is river transport. River transportation companies operate routes between the cities of the [[Peruvian Amazon]]. The main hubs of this network are the cities of [[Iquitos]], [[Puerto Maldonado]], [[Pucallpa]], and [[Yurimaguas]]. Because of the lack of roads in this region, river transport, along with air travel, are the most efficient and important methods of transport.\n\n== Data ==\nTourism is the third largest industry in Peru.<ref name=\"eleconomista\" /> It employs 11% of the labor force in Peru (484,000 direct and 340,000 indirect jobs) the majority of them belonging to the hotel and transportation industries. The industry makes up 7% of the Peruvian gross domestic product and is the fastest growing industry in the country.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} It is regulated by the Commission for the Promotion of Peru (PromPeru) belonging to the [[Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Tourism (Peru)|Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Tourism]].\n\nIn 2000, about 1 million tourists visited Peru that year, with tourist activity increasing due to the decrease of guerrilla activity.<ref name=\"FTWD2\">{{cite book|title=[[Financial Times]] World Desk Reference|last1=Heritage|first1=Andrew|date=December 2002|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=|isbn=9780789488053|location=|pages=462\u2013465}}</ref> By 2017, more than 4 million tourists were visiting the country annually.<ref name=\"mincetur\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mincetur.gob.pe/centro_de_Informacion/mapa_interactivo.htm|title=Llegada de Turistas Internacionales 2011-2017|last=|first=|date=April 2018|website=[[Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Tourism (Peru)|Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Tourism of Peru]]|access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Arrivals by country ===\n\nMost visitors arriving in Peru on a short-term basis in 2017 were from the following countries by nationality:<ref name=\"mincetur\" />\n[[File:Tourists at Inti Punku.jpg|thumb|Tourists and guides at [[Inti Punku]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Pre-Columbian civilizations&nbsp;\u2013 most notably the [[Inca Empire]], [[Chav\u00edn culture|Chav\u00edn]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], and [[Nazca culture|Nasca]]&nbsp;\u2013 left a large archeological and cultural impact on the nation. The ruins of [[Machu Picchu]] are the most internationally recognized of all the ruins of Peru and therefore receive the most tourists. The other popular ruins are those of [[Chan Chan]], [[Sip\u00e1n]], [[Kuelap]], [[Nazca Lines]], [[Ollantaytambo]], [[Caral]], [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n]], and [[Sillustani]].\n\nTourists also visit the Spanish colonial architecture in many cities in Peru. Some of the most outstanding examples of Spanish colonial architecture are in the cities of Lima, [[Arequipa]], and Cusco. These areas, many built over 500 years ago, demonstrate the superb architectural ingenuity of the colonists during the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. The city of Lima has many acclaimed museums holding works of art reflecting the diverse history of the country. These museums include the National Museum, National Museum of Anthropology, Archeology and History; Rafael Larco Herrera Archeological Museum, National Museum of Peruvian Culture, and Museum of Italian Art, among many others. There are also many museums outside Lima, including the [[Regional Museum of the National University of San Martin]] in Tarapoto, [[San Mart\u00edn Province|San Martin]].\n\n=== Ecotourism ===\n[[File:Gocta.jpg|thumb|[[Gocta Cataracts]] near [[Chachapoyas, Peru]]]]\n60% of the land of Peru is in the [[Amazon Basin]], and 74% of the land is covered by the Amazon rainforest itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecotourism.org/peru|title=Peru {{!}} The International Ecotourism Society|website=www.ecotourism.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref> Peru has a higher percentage of land area protected in national parks and reserves than any other country in South America. The [[Peruvian Amazon]] is one of the most pristine, virgin, and untouched rainforests on the earth, making it a destination for tourists interested in nature and ecology; this has prompted increased  tourist infrastructure. Despite this land coverage, nearly 1 million hectares and counting of the rainforest has been decimated between 2001\u20132015 with the following main causes: [[deforestation]] and [[soil degradation]], small and medium-scale agriculture, large-scale agriculture, pasture for livestock, [[gold mining]], coca cultivation, and [[road construction]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://maaproject.org/2017/maap-sintesis2/|title=MAAP S\u00cdNTESIS #2: PATRONES Y DRIVERS DE DEFORESTACI\u00d3N EN LA...|last=Finer|first=Matt|date=2017-02-14|work=MAAP|access-date=2018-02-06|language=es-ES}}</ref> The Amazon's innate beauty and its continuous destruction altogether draw tourists to Peru through ecotourism and environmental voluntourism.\n[[File:Huascar\u00e1n.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|[[Huascar\u00e1n]], Peru's tallest point]]\nThe Peruvian Amazon is divided into two areas: the High Jungle and the Lower Jungle. The High Jungle is more easily accessible, while the Lower Jungle is more pristine and untouched. In recent times, however, the government has increased accessibility to the Lower Jungle. Both areas contain an unrivaled diversity of animal and plant life. Large [[List of national parks in Peru|national preserves]] of interest to tourists include the [[Man\u00fa National Park]], [[Rio Abiseo National Park]], Pacaya Samiria National Reserve, and the [[Tambopata-Candamo]] Protected Area. Tourist agencies in these areas promote eco-friendly tourism to preserve the fragile ecosystems of the rainforest.\n\nIn the [[\u00c1ncash Region]], tourists also experience the mountainous terrain of the [[Andes]]. The region has two mountain ranges of the Andes; the [[Cordillera Negra]], a dark line of mountains without any glacial peaks and the [[Cordillera Blanca]], a line of snowcapped mountains with [[glacier]]s. [[Huascar\u00e1n]], the tallest point in Peru and the fourth highest mountain in the Americas. The region also hosts [[Huascar\u00e1n National Park]], which holds biodiversity of various flora and fauna, being a [[World Heritage Site]] since 1985.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.parkswatch.org/parkprofiles/pdf/hunp_spa.pdf|title=Parque Nacional Huascar\u00e1n (in Spanish)|date=|website=parkswatch.org|publisher=Parkswatch|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=== Adventure tourism ===\nBecause of Peru's geographical diversity, it is possible to go [[surfing]], [[sandboarding]], [[4x4]], [[dune buggy]], [[alpinism]], [[rafting]], [[rappelling]], [[Alpine skiing|downhill]], [[rallying|rally]], [[backpacking (wilderness)|trekking]], [[skiing]], and [[mountain climbing]]. Surfing is extremely popular in Peru, and the country has been host to numerous national and international competitions in the sport. The country is home to the world-famous surfer [[Sof\u00eda Mul\u00e1novich]].\n\nPeru is divided into three geographical regions: the coast, the sierra, and the jungle. Each one has numerous activities suited to its particular climate and environment. The sport of skiing is developing in the city of [[Huaraz]], and new resorts are created to suit the rising tourist demand. The sand dunes of [[Ica Region|Ica]] are popular for dune buggies. River rafting has become very popular among national and international tourists in recent years, and availability in Lima and [[Cusco]] is high. Rapids range in difficulty and there are rafting options from novices to experts. Trekking has become the most popular type of adventure sport among tourists in Peru. This is because of the treks offered from Cusco to [[Machu Picchu]], as well as trails in other parts of the country such as [[Ancash Region|Ancash]]. Mountain climbing is a popular sport among tourists in the sierra region.\n\nFor more information on adventure tourism see the Ancash section of this article below.\n\n=== Gastronomic tourism ===\n{{See also|Peruvian cuisine}}\n[[File:Ceviche del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|[[Ceviche]] is a popular Peruvian seafood dish.]]\n'''Peruvian cuisine''' stems mainly from the combination of Spanish cuisine with traditional native Peruvian ingredients, with later influences from the cuisines of China, Italy, West Africa and Japan, due to the arrival of immigrants from those locations. Each of these cuisines has had to be heavily adapted because of a lack or scarcity of many ingredients. For example, it is still impossible to find such commonplace items as lemons, [[turnip]]s, [[kale]] and [[chestnut]]s in Peru. It is next to impossible to find authentic foreign cuisine to this day because of a lack of ingredients. For example, one can not find authentic Chinese dishes such as [[Mapo dofu]]. Instead one finds a mixture of Chinese cooking that has been adapted to the ingredients available in Peru known as [[Chifa]].\n\nThe three traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are corn, potatoes and beans. These ingredients have been combined with a number of staples brought by the Spanish, such as rice, wheat and meat (such as beef, pork and chicken). Many traditional foods, such as [[quinoa]], [[kiwicha]], [[chili pepper]]s and several roots and tubers which had previously been tossed aside for European products, have seen a resurgence in popularity in recent decades with a revival of interest in native Peruvian food crops.\n\nTraditional foods in the coast, mountains, and jungle are markedly different from each other. Because of this, the local gastronomy depends greatly on what part of Peru one visits<ref>https://gringoinca.com/food-to-try-in-peru/</ref>.\n\n=== Beach tourism ===\nPeru boasts a 2,414-kilometer coastline littered with many beaches attractive to any type of traveler. Beachgoing in Peru is extremely popular among domestic and international travelers alike. Beach resorts and towns are abundant along the coast and many are in popular areas which attract visitors. Two of the most popular beach areas are [[M\u00e1ncora]] and [[Punta Sal]] in the [[Piura Region|Piura]] and [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]] regions respectively, and [[Asia District, Peru|Asia]] in the [[Lima Department]].\n\nThe northern beaches of M\u00e1ncora and Punta Sal have a pleasant beach climate year round whereas Asia is primarily a summertime beach. Because Asia is located near the city of Lima, many beachgoers own houses in that area. In contrast, M\u00e1ncora is many hours from major cities so visitors usually stay in hotels or resorts.\n\n[[File:Mancorabeach1.jpg|thumb|A beach in [[M\u00e1ncora]], [[Piura Region]]]]\nBeachgoing in Peru is affected by fads: Beach homeowners moved from beach to beach resulting from the oversaturation of one beach. In previous years, the beach of [[Anc\u00f3n District|Anc\u00f3n]] was the most popular of Lima; it became oversaturated and beachgoers moved south of the city to the beaches of [[Punta Hermosa District|Punta Hermosa]], [[San Bartolo District|San Bartolo]], [[Santa Mar\u00eda District, Huaura|Santa Maria]] and [[Pucusana District|Pucusana]]. In the last decade, these beaches have become oversaturated as well and beachgoers have moved further south to the development of Asia, which has now become extremely popular and is the primary beach destination for Limeans.\n\nM\u00e1ncora, 17 hours north of Lima by bus and 1.5 hours by plane from [[Talara]], is older than Asia but still a relatively new development. In recent years it has experienced a tourist boom and beachgoers flock there. Its beaches have white sand and the town has many nightclubs and bars frequented by thousands of tourists. The popularity of this beach has become so great that a movie has been made about the beach: ''M\u00e1ncora''. Punta Sal is another beach a half-hour north of Mancora, less popular among young people, and the destination for older people seeking relaxation. Nonetheless it remains a large tourist attraction and is characterized by its white sand beaches and turquoise color waters. Peruvian beaches are popular places for surfing and their waves are world-renowned.\n\nPeru is also a recognized location for surfing. In and around Lima there are surf options for tourists. On the northern coast is the town of Puerto Chicama, home to the longest left-breaking wave in the world at 1.4 miles (2.2 km).<ref>https://gringoinca.com/travel_tips_northern_peru/</ref>\n\n=== Luxury travel ===\nPeru has also been experiencing a continuous growth in luxury travel, particularly from around 2005 onwards.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This niche of tourists arrive seeking high-end hotels and premium experiences in unique destinations, and travel mainly from the U.S. and Europe, but increasingly also from Asian countries, particularly China. The main destinations of interest are [[Cusco]], [[Urubamba, Peru|Urubamba]], and [[Machu Picchu]]. Recently this segment has been expanding to other area such as the [[Puno Region]] and [[Lake Titicaca]], as well as [[Iquitos]] and the [[Colca Canyon]] in Arequipa, as the government, local authorities and local and international travel firms have made large investments in hotels, infrastructure and other tourism development.\n\nThe Peruvian government has made major efforts at securing international investment in the country's high-end tourism industry, particularly in emerging markets.<ref>[http://www.andina.com.pe/english/noticia-peru-to-promote-tourism-and-investment-at-itb-asia-trade-fair-431478.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017013352/http://www.andina.com.pe/english/noticia-peru-to-promote-tourism-and-investment-at-itb-asia-trade-fair-431478.aspx |date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> There are investors from major international hotel chains willing to invest millions of dollars (upwards of US$10 million) in 5 star hotels and resorts in the Mancora and Punta Sal area under capital investment or joint venture schemes.

Romance languages that use this letter include [[Catalan alphabet|Catalan]], [[French alphabet|French]], [[Friulian alphabet|Friulian]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Occitan alphabet|Occitan]], and [[Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese]] as a variant of the letter ''[[C]]''. It is also occasionally used in [[Crimean Tatar alphabet|Crimean Tatar]] and in [[Tajik alphabet|Tajik]] (when written in the Latin script) to represent the {{IPAslink|d\u0361\u0292}} sound. It is often retained in the spelling of [[loanword]]s from any of these languages in [[English language|English]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and other Latin script spelled languages.\n\nIt was first used for the sound of the [[voiceless alveolar affricate]] {{IPAslink|t\u0361s}} in [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] and stems from the [[Visigothic script|Visigothic form of the letter ''z'']] (''\ua762''). The [[phoneme]] originated in [[Vulgar Latin]] from the [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of the plosives {{IPAslink|t}} and {{IPAslink|k}} in some conditions. Later, {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}} changed into {{IPAslink|s}} in many [[Romance language]]s and dialects. Spanish has not used the symbol since an [[orthographic reform]] in the 18th century (which replaced ''\u00e7'' with the now-devoiced ''z''), but it was adopted for writing other languages.\n\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{IPAslink|\u00e7}} represents the [[voiceless palatal fricative]].\n\n==Usage as a letter variant in various languages==\n[[File:Visigothic Z-C cedille.svg|thumb|200px|right|Evolution from Visigoth Z to modern \u00c7.]]\nIn many languages, {{angbr|\u00e7}} represents the \"soft\" sound {{IPAslink|s}} where a {{angbr|c}} would normally represent the \"hard\" sound {{IPAslink|k}}. These include:\n*[[Catalan language|Catalan]]. Known as ''ce trencada'' ('broken C') in this language, where it can be used before {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|o}}, {{angbr|u}} or at the end of a word. Some examples of words with {{angbr|\u00e7}} are ''amena\u00e7a'' ('menace'), ''tor\u00e7at'' ('twisted'), ''xori\u00e7o'' ('chorizo'), ''for\u00e7ut'' ('strong'), ''dol\u00e7'' ('sweet') and ''ca\u00e7a'' ('hunting'). A well-known word with this character is ''Bar\u00e7a'', a common Catalan clipping of [[FC Barcelona|Futbol Club Barcelona]].\n*[[French language|French]] (''c\u00e9 c\u00e9dille''): ''fran\u00e7ais'' ('French'), ''gar\u00e7on'' ('boy'), ''fa\u00e7ade'' ('frontage'), ''grin\u00e7ant'' ('squeaking'), ''le\u00e7on'' ('lesson'), ''re\u00e7u'' ('received' [past participle]). French does not use the character at the end of a word but it can occur at the beginning of a word (e.g., ''\u00e7a'', 'that').<ref name=\":0\">The [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]] online [http://atilf.atilf.fr/academie9.htm dictionary] also gives ''\u00e7\u00e0'' and ''[[:fr:Sho\u00fbdra|\u00e7\u00fbdra]]''.</ref>\n*[[Occitan language|Occitan]] (''ce cedilha''): ''tor\u00e7ut'' ('twisted'), ''\u00e7\u00f2'' ('this'), ''\u00e7a que la'' ('nevertheless'), ''bra\u00e7'' ('arm'), ''br\u00e8\u00e7'' ('cradle'), ''vora\u00e7'' ('voracious'). It can occur at the beginning of a word.\n*[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''c\u00ea-cedilha'' or ''c\u00ea cedilhado''): it is used before {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|o}}, {{angbr|u}}: ''ta\u00e7a'' ('cup'), ''bra\u00e7o'' ('arm'), ''a\u00e7\u00facar'' ('sugar'). Modern Portuguese does not use the character at the beginning or at the end of a word (the nickname for ''Concei\u00e7\u00e3o'' is ''S\u00e3o'', not ''\u00c7\u00e3o''). According to a Portuguese grammar written in 1550, the letter \u00e7 had the sound of /dz/ around that time. Another grammar written around 1700 would say that the letter \u00e7 sounds like /s/, which shows a phonetic evolution that is still valid today.\n*[[Manx language|Manx]] ''aa\u00e7hent'' ('to flash back'), ''at\u00e7him'' ('terror'), ''\u00e7haggil'' ('Gather') the digraph \u00e7h makes a /t\u0283/ sound and so does t\u00e7h\n\nIn other languages, it represents the [[voiceless postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}} (like {{angbr|ch}} in English ''chalk''):\n*[[Friulian language|Friulian]] (''c cun cedilie'') before {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|o}}, {{angbr|u}} or at the end of a word.\n*[[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''\u00e7elik'' ('steel'), ''\u00e7ilek'' ('strawberry'), and ''\u00e7amur'' ('mud').\n\nIn [[Manx language|Manx]], it is used in the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{angbr|\u00e7h}}, which also represents {{IPAslink|t\u0361\u0283}}, to differentiate it from normal {{angbr|ch}}, which represents {{IPAslink|x}}.\n\n===In loanwords only===\n*In [[Basque alphabet|Basque]], {{angbr|\u00e7}} (known as ''ze hautsia'') is used in the loanword ''[[Cura\u00e7ao (liqueur)|cura\u00e7ao]]''.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], it can be found in some words from French and Portuguese, such as ''fa\u00e7ade'', ''re\u00e7u'', ''Proven\u00e7aals'' and ''Cura\u00e7ao''.\n*In [[English alphabet|English]], {{angbr|\u00e7}} is used in loanwords such as ''fa\u00e7ade'' and ''[[lima\u00e7on]]'' (although the [[cedilla]] mark is often dropped: {{angbr|facade}}, {{angbr|limacon}}).\n*In modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]] it can appear in loanwords, especially in Catalan proper nouns.\n\n==Usage as a separate letter in various languages==\nIt represents the [[voiceless postalveolar affricate]] {{IPAslink|t\u0361\u0283}} in the following languages:\n\n*the 4th letter of the [[Albanian alphabet]].\n*the 4th letter of the [[Azerbaijani alphabet]].\n*the 5th letter of the [[Tatar alphabet]] (based on [[Zaman\u00e4lif]]).\n*the 4th letter of the [[Turkish alphabet]].\n*the 3rd letter of the [[Turkmen alphabet]].\n*the 4th letter of the [[Zazaki|Zazaki alphabet]].\n\nIn [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], as the 4th letter of the [[Kazakh alphabets]] based on 2020 amendment of its alphabets, it however represents {{IPAslink|t\u0255}}, this is a little different by other Turkic languages.\n\nIt previously represented a [[voiceless palatal click]] {{IPAslink|\u01c2}} in [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoansi]] and [[Naro language|Naro]], though the former has replaced it with {{angle bracket|\u01c2}} and the latter with {{angle bracket|tc}}.\n\nThe similarly shaped letter [[the (Cyrillic)|the]] (\u04aa&nbsp;\u04ab) is used in the Cyrillic alphabets of [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]] and [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] to represent {{IPAslink|\u03b8}} and {{IPAslink|\u0255}}, respectively.\n\nIt also represents the [[retroflex flap]] {{IPAslink|\u027d}} in the [[Rohingya language#Roman script|Rohingya Latin alphabet]].\n\n[[Janalif]] uses this letter to represent the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPAslink|d\u0361\u0292}}\n\n==<ref name=\":0\" />Computer==\n{{charmap\n| 00C7 | name1 = LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n| 00E7 | name2 = LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n| A762 | name3 = LATIN CAPITAL LETTER VISIGOTHIC Z\n| A763 | name4 = LATIN SMALL LETTER VISIGOTHIC Z\n}}\n\n===Input===\n\nOn Albanian, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish and Italian keyboards, {{key press|\u00c7}} is directly available as a separate key; however, on most other keyboards, including the US and British keyboard, a combination of keys must be used:\n\n*In the [[QWERTY#US-International|US-International keyboard layout]], these are {{key press|'}} followed by either {{key press|C}} or {{key press|Shift|C}}.

Spanish has not used the symbol since an [[orthographic reform]] in the 18th century (which replaced ''\u00e7'' with the now-devoiced ''z''), but it was adopted for writing other languages.\n\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{IPAslink|\u00e7}} represents the [[voiceless palatal fricative]].\n\n==Usage as a letter variant in various languages==\n[[File:Visigothic Z-C cedille.svg|thumb|200px|right|Evolution from Visigoth Z to modern \u00c7.]]\nIn many languages, {{angbr|\u00e7}} represents the \"soft\" sound {{IPAslink|s}} where a {{angbr|c}} would normally represent the \"hard\" sound {{IPAslink|k}}. These include:\n*[[Catalan language|Catalan]]. Known as ''ce trencada'' ('broken C') in this language, where it can be used before {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|o}}, {{angbr|u}} or at the end of a word. Some examples of words with {{angbr|\u00e7}} are ''amena\u00e7a'' ('menace'), ''tor\u00e7at'' ('twisted'), ''xori\u00e7o'' ('chorizo'), ''for\u00e7ut'' ('strong'), ''dol\u00e7'' ('sweet') and ''ca\u00e7a'' ('hunting'). A well-known word with this character is ''Bar\u00e7a'', a common Catalan clipping of [[FC Barcelona|Futbol Club Barcelona]].\n*[[French language|French]] (''c\u00e9 c\u00e9dille''): ''fran\u00e7ais'' ('French'), ''gar\u00e7on'' ('boy'), ''fa\u00e7ade'' ('frontage'), ''grin\u00e7ant'' ('squeaking'), ''le\u00e7on'' ('lesson'), ''re\u00e7u'' ('received' [past participle]). French does not use the character at the end of a word but it can occur at the beginning of a word (e.g., ''\u00e7a'', 'that').<ref name=\":0\">The [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]] online [http://atilf.atilf.fr/academie9.htm dictionary] also gives ''\u00e7\u00e0'' and ''[[:fr:Sho\u00fbdra|\u00e7\u00fbdra]]''.</ref>\n*[[Occitan language|Occitan]] (''ce cedilha''): ''tor\u00e7ut'' ('twisted'), ''\u00e7\u00f2'' ('this'), ''\u00e7a que la'' ('nevertheless'), ''bra\u00e7'' ('arm'), ''br\u00e8\u00e7'' ('cradle'), ''vora\u00e7'' ('voracious').

Modern Portuguese does not use the character at the beginning or at the end of a word (the nickname for ''Concei\u00e7\u00e3o'' is ''S\u00e3o'', not ''\u00c7\u00e3o''). According to a Portuguese grammar written in 1550, the letter \u00e7 had the sound of /dz/ around that time. Another grammar written around 1700 would say that the letter \u00e7 sounds like /s/, which shows a phonetic evolution that is still valid today.\n*[[Manx language|Manx]] ''aa\u00e7hent'' ('to flash back'), ''at\u00e7him'' ('terror'), ''\u00e7haggil'' ('Gather') the digraph \u00e7h makes a /t\u0283/ sound and so does t\u00e7h\n\nIn other languages, it represents the [[voiceless postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}} (like {{angbr|ch}} in English ''chalk''):\n*[[Friulian language|Friulian]] (''c cun cedilie'') before {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|o}}, {{angbr|u}} or at the end of a word.\n*[[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''\u00e7elik'' ('steel'), ''\u00e7ilek'' ('strawberry'), and ''\u00e7amur'' ('mud').\n\nIn [[Manx language|Manx]], it is used in the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{angbr|\u00e7h}}, which also represents {{IPAslink|t\u0361\u0283}}, to differentiate it from normal {{angbr|ch}}, which represents {{IPAslink|x}}.\n\n===In loanwords only===\n*In [[Basque alphabet|Basque]], {{angbr|\u00e7}} (known as ''ze hautsia'') is used in the loanword ''[[Cura\u00e7ao (liqueur)|cura\u00e7ao]]''.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], it can be found in some words from French and Portuguese, such as ''fa\u00e7ade'', ''re\u00e7u'', ''Proven\u00e7aals'' and ''Cura\u00e7ao''.\n*In [[English alphabet|English]], {{angbr|\u00e7}} is used in loanwords such as ''fa\u00e7ade'' and ''[[lima\u00e7on]]'' (although the [[cedilla]] mark is often dropped: {{angbr|facade}}, {{angbr|limacon}}).\n*In modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]] it can appear in loanwords, especially in Catalan proper nouns.\n\n==Usage as a separate letter in various languages==\nIt represents the [[voiceless postalveolar affricate]] {{IPAslink|t\u0361\u0283}} in the following languages:\n\n*the 4th letter of the [[Albanian alphabet]].\n*the 4th letter of the [[Azerbaijani alphabet]].\n*the 5th letter of the [[Tatar alphabet]] (based on [[Zaman\u00e4lif]]).\n*the 4th letter of the [[Turkish alphabet]].\n*the 3rd letter of the [[Turkmen alphabet]].\n*the 4th letter of the [[Zazaki|Zazaki alphabet]].\n\nIn [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], as the 4th letter of the [[Kazakh alphabet]] based on 2020 amendment of its alphabets, it however represents {{IPAslink|t\u0255}}.\n\nIt previously represented a [[voiceless palatal click]] {{IPAslink|\u01c2}} in [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoansi]] and [[Naro language|Naro]], though the former has replaced it with {{angle bracket|\u01c2}} and the latter with {{angle bracket|tc}}.\n\nThe similarly shaped letter [[the (Cyrillic)|the]] (\u04aa&nbsp;\u04ab) is used in the Cyrillic alphabets of [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]] and [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] to represent {{IPAslink|\u03b8}} and {{IPAslink|\u0255}}, respectively.\n\nIt also represents the [[retroflex flap]] {{IPAslink|\u027d}} in the [[Rohingya language#Roman script|Rohingya Latin alphabet]].\n\n[[Janalif]] uses this letter to represent the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPAslink|d\u0361\u0292}}\n\n==<ref name=\":0\" />Computer==\n{{charmap\n| 00C7 | name1 = LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n| 00E7 | name2 = LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n| A762 | name3 = LATIN CAPITAL LETTER VISIGOTHIC Z\n| A763 | name4 = LATIN SMALL LETTER VISIGOTHIC Z\n}}\n\n===Input===\n\nOn Albanian, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish and Italian keyboards, {{key press|\u00c7}} is directly available as a separate key; however, on most other keyboards, including the US and British keyboard, a combination of keys must be used:\n\n*In the [[QWERTY#US-International|US-International keyboard layout]], these are {{key press|'}} followed by either {{key press|C}} or {{key press|Shift|C}}.

[[Morocco]] has been one of the most politically stable countries in [[North Africa]], which has allowed tourism to develop. The Moroccan government created a Ministry of Tourism in 1985.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MyGjpyNAur0C&pg=PA367|title=Geography of Travel & Tourism|last=Hudman|first=Lloyd E.|last2=Jackson|first2=Richard H.|date=2003|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0766832562|language=en}}</ref> Tourism is considered as one of the main foreign exchange sources in Morocco and since 2013 it had the highest number of arrivals out of the countries Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-most-visited-countries-in-africa.html|title=The Most Visited Countries in Africa}}</ref>.

Most of these visitors were [[France|French]] or [[Spain|Spanish]], with about 100,000 each from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Tourists mostly visited large beach resorts along the [[Atlantic]] coast, particularly [[Agadir]]. About 20,000 people from [[Saudi Arabia]] visited, some of whom bought holiday homes. Receipts from tourism fell by 16.5% in 1990, the year the [[Gulf War]] began. In 1994, Algeria closed its border with Morocco after the [[Marrakech]] attack, which caused the number of Algerian visitors to fall considerably; there were 70,000 visitors in 1994 and 13,000 in 1995, compared to 1.66 million in 1992 and 1.28 million in 1993. In 2017, there were 10.3 million tourist arrivals, compared with about 10.1 million in 2016, a 1.5% year over year increase. 30% of the tourists were one of the 3.8 million Moroccans living abroad. Marrakech itself had over 2 million visitors in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2018/01/237558/tourism-marrakech-breaks-records-2017/|title=Tourism in Marrakech Breaks All Records in 2017|date=2018-01-02}}</ref>d\n\n==Tourism industry==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nTourist receipts in 2007 totaled [[United States dollar|US$]]7.55 billion. \nTourism is the second largest foreign exchange earner in Morocco, after the [[phosphate]] industry. The Moroccan government is heavily investing in tourism development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldfinance.com/wealth-management/inspiring-a-tourism-revolution-in-morocco|title=Inspiring a tourism revolution in Morocco|website=www.worldfinance.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> A new tourism strategy called Vision 2010 was developed after the accession of [[King Mohammed VI]] in 1999. The government has targeted that Morocco will have 10 million visitors by 2010, with the hope that tourism will then have risen to 20% of GDP. A large government sponsored marketing campaigns to attract tourists advertised Morocco as a cheap and exotic, yet safe, place for European tourists.\n\nMorocco's relatively high number of tourists has been aided by its location, tourist attractions, and relatively low price. Cruise ships visit the ports of [[Casablanca]] and [[Tangier]]. Morocco is close to Europe and attracts visitors to its beaches. Because of its proximity to Spain, tourists in southern Spain's coastal areas take one- to three-day trips to Morocco. Marrakesh and Agadir are the top two destinations in the country<ref name=\":0\" />. Air services between Morocco and Algeria have been established, many Algerians have gone to Morocco to shop and visit family and friends. Morocco is relatively inexpensive because of the devaluation of the [[dirham]] and the increase of hotel prices in Spain. Morocco has an excellent road and rail infrastructure that links the major cities and tourist destinations with ports and cities with international airports. Low-cost airlines offer cheap flights to the country.\n\n==Plan Azur==\nThe \"[[Plan Azur]]\", is a large-scale project initiated by King Mohammed VI, is meant to internationalise Morocco. The plan provides for creating six coastal resorts for holiday-home owners and tourists (five on the Atlantic coast and one on the Mediterranean), the Daily Telegraph noted. The plan also includes other large-scale development projects such as upgrading regional airports to attract budget airlines, and building new train and road links. Thus, the country achieved an 11% percent rise in tourism in the first five months of 2008 compared with the same period last year, it said, adding that French visitors topped the list with 927,000 followed by Spaniards (587,000) and Britons (141,000). Morocco, which is close to Europe, has a mix of culture and the exotic that makes it popular with Europeans buying holiday homes.[15]\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n{|\n| [[File:N9 Haute Atlas Taddert.JPG|thumb|right|The Atlas mountains]]\n| [[File:Dune sunrise.jpg|thumb|right|Sand dunes in Morocco]]\n| [[File:Tangier 5184a.jpg|thumb|right|Malabata Coast in Tangier]]\n|}\n{|\n| [[File:Bou Inania Madrasa 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Bou Inania Madrasa in Fes]]\n| [[File:Skala de Ville.jpg|thumb|right|Old defense walls of Essaouira]]\n| [[File:Mekn\u00e8s - Estany de l'Aguedal.jpg|thumb|right|Swany water reserve in Meknes]]\n|}\n{|\n| [[File:Ifrane snow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ifrane]], \"Morocco's Switzerland\"]]\n| [[File:Agadir Kasbah 1012.JPG|thumb|right|The beach and Kasbah at Agadir]]\n|}\nThe country's attractions can be divided into seven regions:<ref name=Hudman367>{{cite book |title=Geography of Travel & Tourism |last=Hudman |first=Lloyd E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MyGjpyNAur0C |year=2002 |publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning |isbn=0-7668-3256-2 |pages=367 }}</ref> \n* The four Imperial cities \u2014 the four historical capital cities of Morocco: [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], [[Marrakesh]], [[Meknes]] and [[Rabat]]\n* [[Marrakech]]\n* [[Casablanca]] \u2014 Morocco's largest city; home of the [[Hassan II Mosque]], which has the world's tallest minaret at 656 feet<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1RBMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA102|title=Film + Travel Asia, Oceania, Africa: Traveling the World Through Your Favorite Movies|last=Museyon|date=2009-06-01|publisher=Museyon|isbn=9781938450341|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Tangier]] and the surrounding area\n* [[Ouarzazate]] \u2014 a noted film-making location; the fortified village (ksar) of [[Ait Benhaddou]] west of the city is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/06/unesco-sites.html|title=You're Not a World Traveler Until You Visit these UNESCO sites|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://puremoroccotours.com/places-morocco-visit-enjoyable-exploring-vacation/|title=Places in Morocco|last=Places|first=Pure Morocco|website=Puremorocco Tours and Travel|language=en|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n* [[Agadir]] and its beach resorts\n* [[Tarfaya]] and its beach resorts\n*[[Fez]] \u2013 Morocco's second largest city and it is the science and spiritual capital of Morocco.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jul/25/fez-morocco-medina-restoration-riads-restaurants-flights|title=Fez's medina gets new riads, restaurants and restored monuments|last=Gilbert|first=Sarah|date=2017-07-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> It contains an old area which is considered as the biggest area in the world where vehicles can't get in.

Most of these visitors were [[France|French]] or [[Spain|Spanish]], with about 100,000 each from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Tourists mostly visited large beach resorts along the [[Atlantic]] coast, particularly [[Agadir]]. About 20,000 people from [[Saudi Arabia]] visited, some of whom bought holiday homes. Receipts from tourism fell by 16.5% in 1990, the year the [[Gulf War]] began. In 1994, Algeria closed its border with Morocco after the [[Marrakech]] attack, which caused the number of Algerian visitors to fall considerably; there were 70,000 visitors in 1994 and 13,000 in 1995, compared to 1.66 million in 1992 and 1.28 million in 1993. In 2017, there were 10.3 million tourist arrivals, compared with about 10.1 million in 2016, a 1.5% year over year increase. 30% of the tourists were one of the 3.8 million Moroccans living abroad. Marrakech itself had over 2 million visitors in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2018/01/237558/tourism-marrakech-breaks-records-2017/|title=Tourism in Marrakech Breaks All Records in 2017|date=2018-01-02}}</ref>d\n\n==Tourism industry==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nTourist receipts in 2007 totaled [[United States dollar|US$]]7.55 billion. \nTourism is the second largest foreign exchange earner in Morocco, after the [[phosphate]] industry. The Moroccan government is heavily investing in tourism development<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldfinance.com/wealth-management/inspiring-a-tourism-revolution-in-morocco|title=Inspiring a tourism revolution in Morocco|website=www.worldfinance.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>. A new tourism strategy called Vision 2010 was developed after the accession of [[King Mohammed VI]] in 1999. The government has targeted that Morocco will have 10 million visitors by 2010, with the hope that tourism will then have risen to 20% of GDP. A large government sponsored marketing campaigns to attract tourists advertised Morocco as a cheap and exotic, yet safe, place for European tourists.\n\nMorocco's relatively high number of tourists has been aided by its location, tourist attractions, and relatively low price. Cruise ships visit the ports of [[Casablanca]] and [[Tangier]]. Morocco is close to Europe and attracts visitors to its beaches. Because of its proximity to Spain, tourists in southern Spain's coastal areas take one- to three-day trips to Morocco. Marrakesh and Agadir are the top two destinations in the country<ref name=\":0\" />. Air services between Morocco and Algeria have been established, many Algerians have gone to Morocco to shop and visit family and friends. Morocco is relatively inexpensive because of the devaluation of the [[dirham]] and the increase of hotel prices in Spain. Morocco has an excellent road and rail infrastructure that links the major cities and tourist destinations with ports and cities with international airports. Low-cost airlines offer cheap flights to the country.\n\n==Plan Azur==\nThe \"[[Plan Azur]]\", is a large-scale project initiated by King Mohammed VI, is meant to internationalise Morocco. The plan provides for creating six coastal resorts for holiday-home owners and tourists (five on the Atlantic coast and one on the Mediterranean), the Daily Telegraph noted. The plan also includes other large-scale development projects such as upgrading regional airports to attract budget airlines, and building new train and road links. Thus, the country achieved an 11% percent rise in tourism in the first five months of 2008 compared with the same period last year, it said, adding that French visitors topped the list with 927,000 followed by Spaniards (587,000) and Britons (141,000). Morocco, which is close to Europe, has a mix of culture and the exotic that makes it popular with Europeans buying holiday homes.[15]\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n{|\n| [[File:N9 Haute Atlas Taddert.JPG|thumb|right|The Atlas mountains]]\n| [[File:Dune sunrise.jpg|thumb|right|Sand dunes in Morocco]]\n| [[File:Tangier 5184a.jpg|thumb|right|Malabata Coast in Tangier]]\n|}\n{|\n| [[File:Bou Inania Madrasa 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Bou Inania Madrasa in Fes]]\n| [[File:Skala de Ville.jpg|thumb|right|Old defense walls of Essaouira]]\n| [[File:Mekn\u00e8s - Estany de l'Aguedal.jpg|thumb|right|Swany water reserve in Meknes]]\n|}\n{|\n| [[File:Ifrane snow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ifrane]], \"Morocco's Switzerland\"]]\n| [[File:Agadir Kasbah 1012.JPG|thumb|right|The beach and Kasbah at Agadir]]\n|}\nThe country's attractions can be divided into seven regions:<ref name=Hudman367>{{cite book |title=Geography of Travel & Tourism |last=Hudman |first=Lloyd E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MyGjpyNAur0C |year=2002 |publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning |isbn=0-7668-3256-2 |pages=367 }}</ref> \n* The four Imperial cities \u2014 the four historical capital cities of Morocco: [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], [[Marrakesh]], [[Meknes]] and [[Rabat]]\n* [[Marrakech]]\n* [[Casablanca]] \u2014 Morocco's largest city; home of the [[Hassan II Mosque]], which has the world's tallest minaret at 656 feet<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1RBMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA102|title=Film + Travel Asia, Oceania, Africa: Traveling the World Through Your Favorite Movies|last=Museyon|date=2009-06-01|publisher=Museyon|isbn=9781938450341|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Tangier]] and the surrounding area\n* [[Ouarzazate]] \u2014 a noted film-making location; the fortified village (ksar) of [[Ait Benhaddou]] west of the city is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/06/unesco-sites.html|title=You're Not a World Traveler Until You Visit these UNESCO sites|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://puremoroccotours.com/places-morocco-visit-enjoyable-exploring-vacation/|title=Places in Morocco|last=Places|first=Pure Morocco|website=Puremorocco Tours and Travel|language=en|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n* [[Agadir]] and its beach resorts\n* [[Tarfaya]] and its beach resorts\n*[[Fez]] \u2013 Morocco's second largest city and it is the science and spiritual capital of Morocco.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jul/25/fez-morocco-medina-restoration-riads-restaurants-flights|title=Fez's medina gets new riads, restaurants and restored monuments|last=Gilbert|first=Sarah|date=2017-07-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> It contains an old area which is considered as the biggest area in the world where vehicles can't get in.

[[Tampere]] is the biggest city on the [[Finnish Lakeland]] with other major cities being Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, [[Mikkeli]], [[Lahti]], [[Joensuu]], [[Lappeenranta]], [[Kuopio]] and [[Savonlinna]]. Finland is also known to have excellent water quality, and green deep [[wood]]s and forests around the sea, rivers, and the waterways.\n\nIn wintertime Finland provides opportunities for [[cross-country skiing]] and [[alpine skiing]]. Many of the popular [[ski resort]]s are situated north of the [[Arctic Circle]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], but there are exceptions like [[Kuusamo]] in the northeastern part of [[Oulu Province]] and Himos in [[J\u00e4ms\u00e4]], only 200&nbsp;km North from Helsinki.\n\n[[Santa Claus]] is commonly known to live on [[Korvatunturi]] in Finland. In the town of [[Rovaniemi]] there is the Santa Claus Village for tourists to visit.\n\n[[Moomin World]] in the outskirts of [[Naantali]] is a theme park based on [[Tove Jansson]] child books about the [[Moomin]].\n\nThe biggest picnic the year called Vappu is held on April 30th - May 1st. The celebration happens in every city and village across the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://misstourist.com/9-best-things-helsinki-finland/|title=9 Best things to do in Helsinki, Finland|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Museums in Finland==\n[[Image:loco21.jpg|thumb|200 px|A painstakingly restored British [[0-6-0]] \"[[Neilson and Company]]\" [[0-6-0]] [[steam locomotive]], used in Finland from 1869 well into the 1920s, preserved at the [[Finnish Railway Museum]]]]\n\n* [[National Museum of Finland]]\n* [[Museum of Finnish Architecture]]\n* [[Finnish Museum of Natural History]]\n* [[Finnish National Gallery]]\n* [[Military Museum of Finland]]\n* [[Finnish Railway Museum]] \u2013 [[Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4]]\n* [[Jokioinen Museum Railway]]\n\n== Northern Finland and winter sports ==\nIn the winter there is a large [[snowcastle]] with an [[Ice hotel]] built every year in the northern town of [[Kemi]]. [[Rovaniemi]] is a place from which to see the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora Borealis]] or Northern lights. Tourists in the north of the country in winter often enjoy trips in reindeer sleighs with [[Sami people|Sami]] drivers, in dog sleighs, or on snowmobiles.\n\nIt is also possible to ski, with downhill resorts at [[Saariselk\u00e4]] and [[Levi, Finland|Levi]], and many cross country ski tracks throughout the northern part of the country. Ice hockey is a popular sport in winter, and it is possible to go ice yachting, or ice skating on the ice. Most lakes are also frozen, so [[ice fishing]] (''pilkkiminen'') is quite popular.\n\n== Cities ==\n[[Image:Helsinki Cathedral in July 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Helsinki Cathedral]]]]\n[[Helsinki]], Finland's capital and largest city, receives many visitors year-round. During the summertime thousands of tourists approach [[Helsinki]] by cruising boats travelling across the [[Baltic Sea]]. [[Helsinki]] is known as a clean, modern and safe meeting point between the east and west.\n\nOther popular tourist destinations within Finland include [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]], [[Tampere]], [[Turku]], [[Oulu]], [[Rovaniemi]] and [[Porvoo]].\n\n=== Helsinki ===\n{{See also|List of sites in Helsinki}}\n[[File:11-07-29-helsinki-by-RalfR-027.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Temppeliaukio church]] is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city; half a million people visit it annually.]]\nHelsinki is relatively small and intimate but lively and bustling. The nearby islands are its summer delights.\n\nBecause Helsinki is located on the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] and has many kilometres of coastline, most of its central districts are near the seaside. Helsinki is a very maritime city and is popularly called ''the daughter of the Baltic''.\n\nHelsinki's coastal position makes it ideal to experience in the summertime from one of the many sightseeing ferries leaving from the port of Helsinki. Many of Helsinki's main attractions are also related to the sea, including the [[Suomenlinna]] naval fortress (a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]]) and the [[Seurasaari]] Island with its parks and open-air museum. Locals often spend sunny days at the [[Hietaniemi beach]] (often simply called ''Hietsu''), Helsinki's main beach in the district of T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6.\n\nIn the winter-time Helsinki's northern position makes it dark for most of the day, thus making it a cosy town with much interesting lighting, such as the classic [[Aleksanterinkatu]]'s Christmas street (''Joulukatu''). During the coldest months of the winter it is very common for Helsinkians to go for walks on the frozen sea, although much caution must be taken. There are also many places for [[ice swimming]] along the coast, some with saunas.\n\nAir travel to Helsinki is via [[Helsinki-Vantaa Airport]], situated in the neighbouring city of [[Vantaa]], a city part of [[Greater Helsinki]]. Helsinki also has popular [[cruiseferry]] links with [[Stockholm]], Sweden and [[hydrofoil]] and [[catamaran]] links to [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]. [[Silja Line|Silja]], [[Viking Line|Viking]] and [[Tallink]] are the biggest ferry operators.\n\nHelsinki is also the home of the [[Linnanm\u00e4ki]] amusement park, which features five rollercoasters and many other rides, including the world's first [[Intamin]] ZacSpin rollercoaster.\n\nHelsinki is a safe city for tourists and a safe place in which to live. In terms of personal safety, Helsinki has been named 2nd safest city in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.jhtml?idContent=1306635|title=Mercer - Our Thinking, Insights, and Perspectives|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nHelsinki has also efficient tourist information system maintained by the [[City of Helsinki Tourism & Convention Bureau]] located in the city centre next to [[Esplande park]].\n\n=== Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 ===\n{{wide image|Jyvaskyla panorama.jpg|1050px|A view from Lake Jyv\u00e4sj\u00e4rvi towards the city centre.}}\nLonely Planet calls [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]] as a [[Mecca]] for architecture lovers around the world for its large collection of [[Alvar Aalto]] buildings.

Both museums are designed by a functionalist [[Alvar Aalto]]. The Alvar Aalto Museum displays the artist's most important work and design. The Museum of Central Finland specializes in cultural history. It serves both as the town museum of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 and the provincial museum of Central Finland.\n\nOne of architect Aalto's most significant works S\u00e4yn\u00e4tsalo Town Hall is located in [[S\u00e4yn\u00e4tsalo]] island on Lake [[P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne]].\n\nThe city hosts the '''[[Rally Finland|Neste Oil Rally Finland]]''' (formerly known as '''1000 Lakes Rally'''). It is the biggest annually organised public event in the [[Nordic countries]], gathering over 500,000 spectators every year. The rally has been held since 1951, first as a national competition, then from 1959 on as a [[European Rally Championship]] event and since the introduction of the [[World Rally Championship]] in [[1973 World Rally Championship season|1973]], as Finland's WRC event.\n\n'''UNESCO World Heritage''' site [[Pet\u00e4j\u00e4vesi Old Church]] is located in vicinity of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4.\n\n== Cuisine ==\n{{main|Finnish cuisine}}\n\nFinnish cuisine includes fresh ingredients, particularly game and fish, foraged berries and mushrooms such as [[false morel]]s, and even [[reindeer]]. Alcoholic drinks of note are [[Koskenkorva]], the salty liquorice-flavored [[Salmiakki Koskenkorva]] and cloudberry liqueur.\n\n== Transportation ==\n{{See also|Transportation in Finland}}\n\nThe Finnish rail system is called [[VR (Finnish railway company)|VR]]. It offers InterCity and express trains throughout the country, and the faster [[Pendolino]] trains connecting the major cities. There are very large discounts (usually 50%) available for children (7-16 yr), students, senior citizens, and conscripts. There are international trains to [[St. Petersburg]] (Finnish and Russian day-time trains) and Moscow (Russian over-night train) in Russia. Connections to Sweden are by bus due to [[rail gauge]] differences. It's possible to take the [[Silja Line|Silja]], Tallink and [[Viking Line]] ferries from Helsinki to [[Mariehamn]] in the [[\u00c5land]] archipelago, [[Stockholm]] (Sweden), [[Rostock]] and [[Travem\u00fcnde]] in Germany, and to [[Tallinn]], ([[Estonia]]).\n\nThere are about 25 [[airport]]s in Finland with scheduled passenger services. [[Finnair]], [[Blue1]] and [[Finncomm Airlines]] provide air services both domestically and internationally. [[Helsinki-Vantaa airport]] is Finland's global gateway with scheduled non-stop flights to such places as [[Bangkok]], [[Beijing]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Miami]], [[Nagoya]], [[New Delhi]], [[City of New York|New York]], [[Osaka]], [[Seoul]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Tokyo]]. Helsinki has an optimal location for [[great circle]] [[airline]] traffic routes between [[Western Europe]] and the [[Far East]]. Hence, many foreign tourists visit Helsinki on a stop-over while flying from Asia to Europe or vice versa. The [[Helsinki-Vantaa]] Airport was ranked 18th in the [[Skytrax]] World's Top 100 Airports survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldairportawards.com/awards/world_airport_rating.html|title=The World's Top 100 Airports in 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Provinces of Finland]]\n*[[Culture of Finland]]\n*[[Tourism]]\n*[[Tourism in Norway]]\n*[[Tourism in Sweden]]\n*[[Tourism in Denmark]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikivoyage|Finland}}\n* [http://www.cometofinland.fi Come To Finland: Nostalgic Finnish Travel Posters] - A book about the early marketing of Finland\n* [http://www.visitfinland.com Visit Finland] \u2013 Finland Travel Guide (by Finnish Tourist Board)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080203090033/http://www.mek.fi/web/MekEng/index.nsf Finnish Tourist Board]\n\n{{Finland topics}}\n{{Tourism in Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Tourism in Finland| ]]\n[[Category:Tourism in Europe by country|Finland]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Travel guide|date=January 2008}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2010}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Viking XPRS 2008-04-29.jpg|thumb|right|2008-built fast cruiseferry {{MS|Viking XPRS}} approaching Helsinki.

[[Tampere]] is the biggest city on the [[Finnish Lakeland]] with other major cities being Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, [[Mikkeli]], [[Lahti]], [[Joensuu]], [[Lappeenranta]], [[Kuopio]] and [[Savonlinna]]. Finland is also known to have excellent water quality, and green deep [[wood]]s and forests around the sea, rivers, and the waterways.\n\nIn wintertime Finland provides opportunities for [[cross-country skiing]] and [[alpine skiing]]. Many of the popular [[ski resort]]s are situated north of the [[Arctic Circle]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], but there are exceptions like [[Kuusamo]] in the northeastern part of [[Oulu Province]] and Himos in [[J\u00e4ms\u00e4]], only 200&nbsp;km North from Helsinki.\n\n[[Santa Claus]] is commonly known to live on [[Korvatunturi]] in Finland. In the town of [[Rovaniemi]] there is the Santa Claus Village for tourists to visit.\n\n[[Moomin World]] in the outskirts of [[Naantali]] is a theme park based on [[Tove Jansson]] child books about the [[Moomin]].\n\nThe biggest picnic the year called Vappu is held on April 30th - May 1st. The celebration happens in every city and village across the country<ref>{{cite web|url=https://misstourist.com/9-best-things-helsinki-finland/|title=9 Best things to do in Helsinki, Finland|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref>.\n\n==Museums in Finland==\n[[Image:loco21.jpg|thumb|200 px|A painstakingly restored British [[0-6-0]] \"[[Neilson and Company]]\" [[0-6-0]] [[steam locomotive]], used in Finland from 1869 well into the 1920s, preserved at the [[Finnish Railway Museum]]]]\n\n* [[National Museum of Finland]]\n* [[Museum of Finnish Architecture]]\n* [[Finnish Museum of Natural History]]\n* [[Finnish National Gallery]]\n* [[Military Museum of Finland]]\n* [[Finnish Railway Museum]] \u2013 [[Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4]]\n* [[Jokioinen Museum Railway]]\n\n== Northern Finland and winter sports ==\nIn the winter there is a large [[snowcastle]] with an [[Ice hotel]] built every year in the northern town of [[Kemi]]. [[Rovaniemi]] is a place from which to see the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora Borealis]] or Northern lights. Tourists in the north of the country in winter often enjoy trips in reindeer sleighs with [[Sami people|Sami]] drivers, in dog sleighs, or on snowmobiles.\n\nIt is also possible to ski, with downhill resorts at [[Saariselk\u00e4]] and [[Levi, Finland|Levi]], and many cross country ski tracks throughout the northern part of the country. Ice hockey is a popular sport in winter, and it is possible to go ice yachting, or ice skating on the ice. Most lakes are also frozen, so [[ice fishing]] (''pilkkiminen'') is quite popular.\n\n== Cities ==\n[[Image:Helsinki Cathedral in July 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Helsinki Cathedral]]]]\n[[Helsinki]], Finland's capital and largest city, receives many visitors year-round. During the summertime thousands of tourists approach [[Helsinki]] by cruising boats travelling across the [[Baltic Sea]]. [[Helsinki]] is known as a clean, modern and safe meeting point between the east and west.\n\nOther popular tourist destinations within Finland include [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]], [[Tampere]], [[Turku]], [[Oulu]], [[Rovaniemi]] and [[Porvoo]].\n\n=== Helsinki ===\n{{See also|List of sites in Helsinki}}\n[[File:11-07-29-helsinki-by-RalfR-027.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Temppeliaukio church]] is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city; half a million people visit it annually.]]\nHelsinki is relatively small and intimate but lively and bustling. The nearby islands are its summer delights.\n\nBecause Helsinki is located on the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] and has many kilometres of coastline, most of its central districts are near the seaside. Helsinki is a very maritime city and is popularly called ''the daughter of the Baltic''.\n\nHelsinki's coastal position makes it ideal to experience in the summertime from one of the many sightseeing ferries leaving from the port of Helsinki. Many of Helsinki's main attractions are also related to the sea, including the [[Suomenlinna]] naval fortress (a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]]) and the [[Seurasaari]] Island with its parks and open-air museum. Locals often spend sunny days at the [[Hietaniemi beach]] (often simply called ''Hietsu''), Helsinki's main beach in the district of T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6.\n\nIn the winter-time Helsinki's northern position makes it dark for most of the day, thus making it a cosy town with much interesting lighting, such as the classic [[Aleksanterinkatu]]'s Christmas street (''Joulukatu''). During the coldest months of the winter it is very common for Helsinkians to go for walks on the frozen sea, although much caution must be taken. There are also many places for [[ice swimming]] along the coast, some with saunas.\n\nAir travel to Helsinki is via [[Helsinki-Vantaa Airport]], situated in the neighbouring city of [[Vantaa]], a city part of [[Greater Helsinki]]. Helsinki also has popular [[cruiseferry]] links with [[Stockholm]], Sweden and [[hydrofoil]] and [[catamaran]] links to [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]. [[Silja Line|Silja]], [[Viking Line|Viking]] and [[Tallink]] are the biggest ferry operators.\n\nHelsinki is also the home of the [[Linnanm\u00e4ki]] amusement park, which features five rollercoasters and many other rides, including the world's first [[Intamin]] ZacSpin rollercoaster.\n\nHelsinki is a safe city for tourists and a safe place in which to live. In terms of personal safety, Helsinki has been named 2nd safest city in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.jhtml?idContent=1306635|title=Mercer - Our Thinking, Insights, and Perspectives|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nHelsinki has also efficient tourist information system maintained by the [[City of Helsinki Tourism & Convention Bureau]] located in the city centre next to [[Esplande park]].\n\n=== Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 ===\n{{wide image|Jyvaskyla panorama.jpg|1050px|A view from Lake Jyv\u00e4sj\u00e4rvi towards the city centre.}}\nLonely Planet calls [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]] as a [[Mecca]] for architecture lovers around the world for its large collection of [[Alvar Aalto]] buildings.

Both museums are designed by a functionalist [[Alvar Aalto]]. The Alvar Aalto Museum displays the artist's most important work and design. The Museum of Central Finland specializes in cultural history. It serves both as the town museum of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 and the provincial museum of Central Finland.\n\nOne of architect Aalto's most significant works S\u00e4yn\u00e4tsalo Town Hall is located in [[S\u00e4yn\u00e4tsalo]] island on Lake [[P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne]].\n\nThe city hosts the '''[[Rally Finland|Neste Oil Rally Finland]]''' (formerly known as '''1000 Lakes Rally''').

The spider belongs to the [[genus]] ''[[Ascyltus]]'', a group of jumping spiders easily identified both by their relatively large size.\n\n==Description==\n\nA. pterygodes can be differentiated from other fissidentate Pacific genera by the antero-lateral \"cheek\" areas of the carapace. These areas are filled with iridescent scales. These areas are often larger than other Pacific genera. They usually begin to be detectable in half-grown juveniles. Other identifying features include the absence of lateral spines on the first metatarsi, first coxae separated by more than the diameter of one of them, eyes in normal three rows instead of four (the second row midway between the first and third), pedicel concealed by abdomen in dorsal view, and cheliceral promargin in males with a large multicusped tooth. Species limits are not clear and the actual number of distinct species is unknown. Palpal structures are rather similar in all species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berry |first1=James |title=Salticidae of the pacific islands. II.

The spider belongs to the [[genus]] ''[[Ascyltus]]'', a group of jumping spiders easily identified both by their relatively large size.\n\n==Description==\n\nA. pterygodes can be differentiated from other fissidentate Pacific genera by the antero-lateral \"cheek\" areas of the carapace. These areas are filled with iridescent scales. These areas are often larger than other Pacific genera. They usually begin to be detectable in half-grown juveniles. Other identifying features include the absence of lateral spines on the first metatarsi, first coxae separated by more than the diameter of one of them, eyes in normal three rows instead of four (the second row midway between the first and third), pedicel concealed by abdomen in dorsal view, and cheliceral promargin in males with a large multicusped tooth. Species limits are not clear and the actual number of distinct species is unknown. Palpal structures are rather similar in all species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berry |first1=James |title=Salticidae of the pacific islands. II.

Meaning they will eat plants or other insects depending on which presents itself first. A. pterygodes will not limit itself to just insects, rather it will eat insects, bugs and even its own kind. In its plant-based diet A. pterygodes prefers to eat nectar and pollen. Ascyltus pterygodes is also known to controlled the outbreak of coconut moths in Fiji.\n [\u201cIt is my impression that this jumping spider or a relative was once cited as being of considerable economic importance as a control agent.

This area includes the forests of \u2018ohi\u2018a and koa. These forests are wet and mountainous regions with some being poorly drained portions. Due to this, they contain wet grasslands and small montane lakes with numerous streams running throughout the forests.\n\tLaupahoehoe is located in the North Hilo District on the island of Hawaii and stretches from just above 1,600 feet to about 4,600 feet elevation. Hakalau National Wildlife Refuge is adjacent to Laupahoehoe Reserve and protects habitats for local wildlife\n\tMany of the A. pterygodes, when located, can be found on things like leaves and bushes. These include common shrubs and plants like the banana plant. They have also been found inside of people\u2019s homes but this occurrence is not a common one.<Laupahoehoe. (2018, January 2).

TOC in source waters comes from decaying [[natural organic matter]] (NOM) as well as [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] sources. [[Humic acid]], fulvic acid, [[amine]]s, and [[urea]] are examples of NOM. Some [[detergents]], [[pesticides]], [[fertilizers]], [[herbicides]], industrial chemicals, and [[Organochloride|chlorinated organics]] are examples of synthetic sources.<ref>Hendricks, David W., ''Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical and Chemical.'' Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2007, pp 44\u201362</ref> Before source water is treated for [[Disinfectant|disinfection]], TOC provides an estimate of the amount of NOM in the water source. In [[water treatment]] facilities, source water is subject to reaction with [[chloride]] containing disinfectants.  When the raw water is chlorinated, [[Percent active chlorine|active chlorine]] compounds (Cl<sub>2</sub>, HOCl, ClO<sup>\u2212</sup>) react with NOM to produce chlorinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Researchers have determined that higher levels of NOM in source water during the disinfection process will increase the amount of [[carcinogen]]s in the processed drinking water.{{Citation needed|reason=what research(ers)?|date=August 2013}}\n\nWith passage of the U.S. [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] in 2001, TOC analysis emerged as a quick and accurate alternative to the classical but more lengthy [[Biochemical oxygen demand|biological oxygen demand]] (BOD) and [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD) tests traditionally reserved for assessing the [[Water pollution|pollution]] potential of [[wastewater]]s. Today, environmental agencies regulate the trace limits of DBPs in drinking water.

Cincinnati, OH (2009).[http://www.epa.gov/nerlcwww/Method%20415_3_Rev1_2_Final.pdf \"Method 415.3: Determination of Total Organic Carbon and Specific UV Absorbance at 254 nm in Source Water and Drinking Water.\"] Revision 1.2.

Numerous evaluation methods have been introduced, including these based on [[Well logging|wireline logs]] and in situ techniques.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nie|first=Xin|last2=Wan|first2=Yu|last3=Bie|first3=Fan|date=2017-05-05|title=Dual-shale-content method for total organic carbon content evaluation from wireline logs in organic shale|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=133\u2013137|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0011|issn=2391-5447|bibcode=2017OGeo....9...11N|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Pharmaceutical===\nIntroduction of organic matter into water systems occurs not only from living organisms and from decaying matter in source water, but also from [[Water purification|purification]] and distribution system materials. A relationship may exist between [[endotoxin]]s, [[Microorganism|microbial]] growth, and the development of [[biofilm]]s on [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] walls and biofilm growth within pharmaceutical distribution systems. A correlation is believed to exist between TOC concentrations and the levels of endotoxins and microbes.  Sustaining low TOC levels helps to control levels of endotoxins and microbes and thereby the development of biofilm growth. The [[United States Pharmacopoeia]] (USP), [[European Pharmacopoeia]] (EP) and Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) recognize TOC as a required test for purified water and water for injection (WFI).  For this reason, TOC has found acceptance as a [[process control]] attribute in the [[biotechnology]] industry to monitor the performance of unit operations comprising purification and distribution systems. As many of these biotechnology operations include the preparation of medicines, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) enacts numerous regulations to protect the health of the public and ensure the product quality is maintained. To make sure there is no [[Foodborne illness|cross-contamination]] between product runs of different drugs, various cleaning procedures are performed. TOC concentration levels are used to track the success of these cleaning validation procedures especially\n\n==Measurement==\n[[File:Total Carbon (TC).svg|thumb|Relationship of carbon-content categories]]\nA variety of different terms are used to identify the different types of carbon present at different levels of detail.\n\n*'''Total Carbon (TC)''' \u2013 all the carbon in the sample, including both inorganic and organic carbon\n*'''Total Inorganic Carbon (TIC)''' \u2013 often referred to as inorganic carbon (IC), [[carbonate]], [[bicarbonate]], and [[Solvation|dissolved]] [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>).\n*'''Total Organic Carbon (TOC)''' \u2013 material derived from decaying vegetation, bacterial growth, and [[Metabolism|metabolic]] activities of living organisms or chemicals.\n*'''Elemental Carbon (EC)''' \u2013 [[charcoal]], [[coal]], and [[soot]].

One analysis technique involves a two-stage process commonly referred to as TC-IC. It measures the amount of inorganic carbon (IC) evolved from an acidified [[wikt:aliquot|aliquot]] of a sample and also the amount of total carbon (TC) present in the sample. TOC is calculated by subtraction of the IC value from the TC the sample.  Another variant employs acidification of the sample to evolve carbon dioxide and measuring it as inorganic carbon (IC), then [[Redox|oxidizing]] and measuring the remaining non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC). This is called TIC-NPOC analysis. A more common method directly measures TOC in the sample by again acidifying the sample to a [[pH]] value of two or less to release the IC gas but in this case to the air not for measurement.  The remaining non-purgeable CO<sub>2</sub> gas (NPOC) contained in the liquid aliquot is then oxidized releasing the gases.  These gases are then sent to the detector for measurement.\n\nWhether the analysis of TOC is by TC-IC or NPOC methods, it may be broken into three main stages:\n#Acidification\n#Oxidation\n#Detection and Quantification\n\nThe first stage is acidification of the sample for the removal of the IC and POC gases.  The release of these gases to the detector for measurement or to the air is dependent upon which type of analysis is of interest, the former for TC-IC and the latter for TOC (NPOC).\n\n===Acidification===\nAddition of acid and inert-gas [[Sparging (chemistry)|sparging]] allows all bicarbonate and carbonate ions to be converted to carbon dioxide, and this IC product vented along with any POC that was present.\n\n===Oxidation===\nThe second stage is the oxidation of the carbon in the remaining sample in the form of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and other gases. Modern TOC analyzers perform this oxidation step by several processes:\n# High Temperature [[Combustion]]\n# High temperature [[Catalysis|catalytic]] oxidation (HTCO)\n# [[Photo-oxidation of polymers|Photo-oxidation]] alone\n# Thermo-chemical oxidation\n# [[Photochemistry|Photo-chemical]] oxidation\n# [[Electrolyte|Electrolytic]] Oxidation\n\n====High temperature combustion====\nPrepared samples are combusted at 1,200&nbsp;\u00b0C in an [[oxygen]]-rich atmosphere. All carbon present converts to carbon dioxide, flows through [[Carbon dioxide scrubber|scrubber tubes]] to remove interferences such as chlorine gas, and water [[vapor]], and the carbon dioxide is measured either by [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] into a strong base then weighed, or using an [[Infrared Detector]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tdi-bi.com/analytical_services/environmental/NOAA_methods/TOC.pdf |title=NOAA methods |website=www.tdi-bi.com }}</ref> Most modern analyzers use non-[[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive]] infrared (NDIR) for detection of the carbon dioxide. Compared to the conventional high temperature catalytic oxidation, the great benefit of the combustion-method is the high oxidation power, so that oxidation-promoting catalysts are superfluous.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.process-worldwide.com/how-to-profit-from-toc-analyzers-reliable-monitoring-of-water-quality-a-435643/|title=How to Profit from TOC Analyzers \u2014 Reliable Monitoring of Water Quality|first=Vogel Communications Group GmbH & Co.|last=KG|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====High temperature catalytic oxidation====\n[[File:Combustion Tube with Platinum Catalyst.jpg|thumb|An HTCO combustion tube packed with platinum catalyst]]\nA manual or automated process injects the sample onto a [[platinum]] catalyst at 680&nbsp;\u00b0C in an oxygen rich atmosphere.

A carbon-free [[carrier gas]] transports the CO<sub>2</sub>, through a [[moisture]] trap and [[halide]] scrubbers to remove water vapor and halides from the gas stream before it reaches the detector. These substances can interfere with the detection of the CO<sub>2</sub> gas. The HTCO method may be useful in those applications where difficult to oxidize compounds, or high [[molecular weight]] organics, are present as it provides almost complete oxidation of organics including solids and particulates small enough to be injected into the furnace. The major drawback of HTCO analysis is its unstable baseline resulting from the gradual accumulation of non-[[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]] within the combustion tube. These residues continuously change TOC background levels requiring continuous background correction. Because [[Aqueous solution|aqueous]] samples are injected directly into a very hot, usually [[quartz]], furnace only small aliquots (less than 2 milliliters and usually less than 400 micro-liters) of sample can be handled making the methods less sensitive than chemical oxidation methods capable of digesting as much as 10 times more sample. Also, the [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] content of the samples do not combust, and so therefore, gradually build a residue inside the combustion tube eventually clogging the catalyst resulting in poor peak shapes, and degraded accuracy or precision, unless appropriate maintenance procedures are followed. The catalyst should be regenerated or replaced as needed.

The UV oxidation method offers the most reliable, low maintenance method of analyzing TOC in ultra-pure waters.\n\n====Ultraviolet/persulfate oxidation====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\nLike the photo-oxidation method, UV light is the oxidizer but the oxidation power of the reaction is magnified by the addition of a chemical oxidizer, which is usually a [[persulfate]] compound.

However, there are oxidation limitations of this method. Limitations include the inaccuracies associated with the addition of any foreign substance into the analyte and samples with high amounts of particulates.  Performing \"System Blank\" analysis, which is to analyze then subtract the amount of carbon contributed by the chemical additive, inaccuracies are lowered. However, analyses of levels below 200 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] TOC are still difficult.\n\n====Thermochemical persulfate oxidation====\nAlso known as heated persulfate, the method utilizes the same [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]] formation as UV persulfate oxidation except uses heat to magnify the oxidizing power of persulfate. Chemical oxidation of carbon with a strong oxidizer, such as persulfate, is highly efficient, and unlike UV, is not susceptible to lower recoveries caused by [[turbidity]] in samples. The analysis of system blanks, necessary in all chemical procedures, is especially necessary with heated persulfate TOC methods because the method is so sensitive that [[reagent]]s cannot be prepared with carbon contents low enough to not be detected. Persulfate methods are used in the analysis of wastewater, drinking water, and pharmaceutical waters. When used in conjunction with sensitive NDIR detectors heated persulfate TOC instruments readily measure TOC at single digit parts per billion (ppb) up to hundreds of parts per million (ppm) depending on sample volumes.\n\n===Detection and quantification===\nAccurate detection and quantification are the most vital components of the TOC analysis process. Conductivity and non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) are the two common detection methods used in modern TOC analyzers.\n\n====Conductivity====\nThere are two types of conductivity detectors, direct and membrane.\nDirect conductivity provides an all-encompassing approach of measuring CO<sub>2</sub>.  This detection method uses no carrier gas, is good at the parts per billion (ppb) ranges, but has a very limited analytical range.\nMembrane conductivity relies upon the filtering of the CO<sub>2</sub> prior to measuring it with a conductivity cell. Both methods analyze sample conductivity before and after oxidization, attributing this differential measurement to the TOC of the sample.  During the sample oxidization phase, CO<sub>2</sub> (directly related to the TOC in the sample) and other gases are formed. The dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> forms a weak acid, thereby changing the conductivity of the original sample proportionately to the TOC in the sample. Conductivity analyses assume that only CO<sub>2</sub> is present within the solution. As long as this holds true, then the TOC calculation by this differential measurement is valid.  However, depending on the chemical species present in the sample and their individual products of oxidation, they may present either a positive or a negative interference to the actual TOC value, resulting in analytical error.  Some of the interfering chemical species include Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>, SO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, and H<sup>+</sup>.   Small changes in pH and temperature fluctuations also contribute to inaccuracy.\nMembrane conductivity analyzers have improved upon the direct conductivity approach by incorporating the use of hydrophobic gas permeation membranes to allow a more \u201cselective\u201d passage of the dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> gas and nothing else. This provides a more precise and accurate measurement of the organics that were converted to CO<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2656.htm|title=ASTM E2656 - 16 Standard Practice for Real-time Release Testing of Pharmaceutical Water for the Total Organic Carbon Attribute|website=www.astm.org}}</ref>\n\n====Non-dispersive infrared (NDIR)====\nThe non-dispersive infrared analysis (NDIR) method offers the only practical interference-free method for detecting CO<sub>2</sub> in TOC analysis. The principal advantage of using NDIR is that it directly and specifically measures the CO<sub>2</sub> generated by oxidation of the organic carbon in the oxidation [[Chemical reactor|reactor]], rather than relying on a measurement of a secondary, corrected effect, such as used in conductivity measurements.\n\n[[File:Atmosfaerisk spredning.gif|thumb|Plot of atmospheric transmittance in part of IR region showing CO<sub>2</sub> absorbing wavelengths]]\n\nA traditional NDIR detector relies upon flow-through-cell technology, where the oxidation product flows into and out of the detector continuously.  A region of absorption of infrared light specific to CO<sub>2</sub>, usually around 4.26&nbsp;\u00b5m (2350&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>), is measured over time as the gas flows through the detector. A second reference measurement that is non-specific to CO<sub>2</sub> is also taken{{clarify|date=November 2016}}<!-- what wavelength or other method is used? --> and the differential result [[Correlation|correlates]] to the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the detector at that moment.  As the gas continues to flow into and out of the detector cell the sum of the measurements results in a peak that is [[Integral|integrated]] and correlated to the total CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the sample aliquot.\n\nA new advance of NDIR technology is Static Pressurized Concentration (SPC). The exit valve of the NDIR is closed to allow the detector to become pressurized.  Once the gases in the detector have reached [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], the concentration of the CO<sub>2</sub> is analyzed.  This pressurization of the sample gas stream in the NDIR, a patented technique, allows for increased sensitivity and precision by measuring the entirety of the oxidation products of the sample in one reading, compared to flow-through cell technology. The output signal is proportional to the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the carrier gas, from the oxidation of the sample aliquot. UV/ Persulfate oxidation combined with NDIR detection provides good oxidation of organics, low instrument maintenance, good precision at ppb levels, relatively fast sample analysis time and easily accommodates multiple applications, including purified water (PW), water for injection (WFI), CIP, drinking water and ultra-pure water analyses.\n\n==Analyzers==\nVirtually all TOC analyzers measure the CO<sub>2</sub> formed when organic carbon is oxidized and/or when inorganic carbon is acidified. [[Oxidation]] is performed either through [[Platinum group#Applications|Pt-catalyzed]] combustion, by heated persulfate, or with a [[UV]]/[[Sodium persulfate|persulfate]] reactor. Once the CO<sub>2</sub> is formed, it is measured by a detector: either a conductivity cell (if the CO<sub>2</sub> is aqueous) or a non-dispersive infrared cell (after purging the aqueous CO<sub>2</sub> into the gaseous phase). Conductivity detection is only desirable in the lower TOC ranges in deionized waters, whereas NDIR detection excels in all TOC ranges.  A variation described as [http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2656.htm Membrane Conductometric Detection] can allow for measurement of TOC across a wide analytical range in both deionized and non-deionized water samples.  Modern high-performance TOC instruments are capable of detecting carbon concentrations well below 1&nbsp;\u00b5g/L (1 part per billion or ppb).\n\nA total organic carbon analyzer determines the amount of carbon in a water sample. By acidifying the sample and flushing with nitrogen or helium the sample removes inorganic carbon, leaving only organic carbon sources for measurement. There are two types of analyzers. One uses combustion and the other chemical oxidation. This is used as a water purity test, as the presence of bacteria introduces organic carbon.\n\n===Analyzer field testing and Reports===\n\nA non-profit research and testing organization, the Instrumentation Testing Association (ITA) can provide results of field testing online TOC analyzers in an industrial wastewater application.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.instrument.org/about.htm|title=About ITA|website=www.instrument.org}}</ref> Gulf Coast Waste Disposal Authority (GCWDA), Bayport Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant in Pasadena, Texas sponsored and conducted this test in 2011. The GCWDA Bayport facility treats approximately 30 mgd of industrial waste received from approximately 65 customers (primarily petrochemical). Field tests consisted of operating online TOC analyzers at the influent of the Bayport facility in which TOC concentrations can range from 490 to 1020&nbsp;mg/L with an average of 870&nbsp;mg/L. GCWDA conducts approximately 102 TOC analyses in their laboratory per day at their Bayport treatment facility and use TOC measurements for process control and billing purposes. GCWDA plans to use online TOC analyzers for process control, detecting influent slug loads from industries and to potentially use online TOC analyzers to detect and monitor volatiles of the incoming stream. Field tests were conducted for a period of 90-days and used laboratory conformance measurements once per day to compare with analyzer output to demonstrate the instrument's overall accuracy when subjected to many simultaneously changing parameters as experienced in real-time monitoring conditions. Field test results can provide information regarding instrument design, operation and maintenance requirements which influence the performance of the instruments in field applications. The field test report includes evaluations of online TOC analyzers utilizing the following technologies: High Temperature Combustion (HTC), High Temperature Catalytic/Combustion Oxidation (HTCO), Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO), and Two-Stage Advanced Oxidation (TSAO).\n\n===Combustion===\nIn a combustion analyzer, half of the sample is injected into a chamber where it is acidified, usually with phosphoric acid, to turn all of the inorganic carbon into carbon dioxide as per the following reaction:{{clarify|date=November 2016}}\n\n: CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O \u21cc H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> \u21ccH<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> \u21cc 2H<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>\n\nThis is then sent to a detector for measurement. The other half of the sample is injected into a combustion chamber which is raised to between 600\u2013700&nbsp;\u00b0C, some even up to 1200&nbsp;\u00b0C. Here, all the carbon reacts with oxygen, forming carbon dioxide. It's then flushed into a cooling chamber, and finally into the detector. Usually, the detector used is a non-dispersive infrared [[spectrophotometer]]. By finding the total inorganic carbon and subtracting it from the total carbon content, the amount of organic carbon is determined.\n\n===Chemical oxidation===\nChemical oxidation analyzers inject the sample into a chamber with phosphoric acid followed by persulfate. The analysis is separated into two steps. One removes inorganic carbon by acidification and purging. After removal of inorganic carbon persulfate is added and the sample is either heated or bombarded with UV light from a mercury vapor lamp. Free radicals form persulfate and react with any carbon available to form carbon dioxide. The carbon from both determination (steps) is either run through membranes which measure the [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] changes that result from the presence of varying amounts of carbon dioxide, or purged into and detected by a sensitive NDIR detector. Same as the combustion analyzer, the total carbon formed minus the inorganic carbon gives a good estimate of the total organic carbon in the sample.\nThis method is often used in online applications because of its low maintenance requirements.\n\n==Applications==\nTOC is the first chemical analysis to be carried out on potential petroleum [[source rock]] in [[oil exploration]].  It is very important in detecting contaminants in drinking water, cooling water, water used in semiconductor manufacturing, and water for pharmaceutical use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mt.com/us/en/home/library/guides/process-analytics/pure-water-guide.html |title=Pure Water Guide: Regulations and Standards Overview for Quality Assurance |website=www.mt.com}}</ref> Analysis may be made either as an online continuous measurement or a lab-based measurement.\n\nTOC detection is an important measurement because of the effects it may have on the environment, human health, and manufacturing processes.  TOC is a highly sensitive, non-specific measurement of all organics present in a sample.  It, therefore, can be used to regulate the organic chemical discharge to the environment in a manufacturing plant. In addition, low TOC can confirm the absence of potentially harmful organic chemicals in water used to manufacture pharmaceutical products.  TOC is also of interest in the field of potable [[water purification#Tertiary treatment|water purification]] due to byproducts of disinfection.  Inorganic carbon poses little to no threat.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Total Organic Carbon}}\n[[Category:Carbon]]\n[[Category:Soil tests]]\n[[Category:Water pollution]]\n[[Category:Water quality indicators]]\n", "text_old": "{{fix|date=December 2007}}\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}\n{{split|date=September 2017|Total Carbon|Total Organic Carbon}}\n\n'''Total organic carbon''' ('''TOC''')  is the amount of [[carbon]] found in an [[organic compound]] and is often used as a non-specific indicator of [[water quality]] or cleanliness of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment.

Subtracting the inorganic carbon from the total carbon yields TOC. Another common variant of TOC analysis involves removing the TIC portion first and then measuring the leftover carbon. This method involves purging an [[acid]]ified sample with carbon-free air or [[nitrogen]] prior to measurement, and so is more accurately called non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC).<ref>{{cite book |author1=Lenore S.

TOC in source waters comes from decaying [[natural organic matter]] (NOM) as well as [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] sources. [[Humic acid]], fulvic acid, [[amine]]s, and [[urea]] are examples of NOM. Some [[detergents]], [[pesticides]], [[fertilizers]], [[herbicides]], industrial chemicals, and [[Organochloride|chlorinated organics]] are examples of synthetic sources.<ref>Hendricks, David W., ''Water Treatment Unit Processes: Physical and Chemical.'' Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2007, pp 44\u201362</ref> Before source water is treated for [[Disinfectant|disinfection]], TOC provides an estimate of the amount of NOM in the water source. In [[water treatment]] facilities, source water is subject to reaction with [[chloride]] containing disinfectants.  When the raw water is chlorinated, [[Percent active chlorine|active chlorine]] compounds (Cl<sub>2</sub>, HOCl, ClO<sup>\u2212</sup>) react with NOM to produce chlorinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Researchers have determined that higher levels of NOM in source water during the disinfection process will increase the amount of [[carcinogen]]s in the processed drinking water.{{Citation needed|reason=what research(ers)?|date=August 2013}}\n\nWith passage of the U.S. [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] in 2001, TOC analysis emerged as a quick and accurate alternative to the classical but more lengthy [[Biochemical oxygen demand|biological oxygen demand]] (BOD) and [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD) tests traditionally reserved for assessing the [[Water pollution|pollution]] potential of [[wastewater]]s. Today, environmental agencies regulate the trace limits of DBPs in drinking water.

A relationship may exist between [[endotoxin]]s, [[Microorganism|microbial]] growth, and the development of [[biofilm]]s on [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] walls and biofilm growth within pharmaceutical distribution systems. A correlation is believed to exist between TOC concentrations and the levels of endotoxins and microbes.  Sustaining low TOC levels helps to control levels of endotoxins and microbes and thereby the development of biofilm growth. The [[United States Pharmacopoeia]] (USP), [[European Pharmacopoeia]] (EP) and Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) recognize TOC as a required test for purified water and water for injection (WFI).  For this reason, TOC has found acceptance as a [[process control]] attribute in the [[biotechnology]] industry to monitor the performance of unit operations comprising purification and distribution systems. As many of these biotechnology operations include the preparation of medicines, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) enacts numerous regulations to protect the health of the public and ensure the product quality is maintained. To make sure there is no [[Foodborne illness|cross-contamination]] between product runs of different drugs, various cleaning procedures are performed. TOC concentration levels are used to track the success of these cleaning validation procedures especially\n\n==Measurement==\n[[File:Total Carbon (TC).svg|thumb|Relationship of carbon-content categories]]\nA variety of different terms are used to identify the different types of carbon present at different levels of detail.\n\n*'''Total Carbon (TC)''' \u2013 all the carbon in the sample, including both inorganic and organic carbon\n*'''Total Inorganic Carbon (TIC)''' \u2013 often referred to as inorganic carbon (IC), [[carbonate]], [[bicarbonate]], and [[Solvation|dissolved]] [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>).\n*'''Total Organic Carbon (TOC)''' \u2013 material derived from decaying vegetation, bacterial growth, and [[Metabolism|metabolic]] activities of living organisms or chemicals.\n*'''Elemental Carbon (EC)''' \u2013 [[charcoal]], [[coal]], and [[soot]].

One analysis technique involves a two-stage process commonly referred to as TC-IC. It measures the amount of inorganic carbon (IC) evolved from an acidified [[wikt:aliquot|aliquot]] of a sample and also the amount of total carbon (TC) present in the sample. TOC is calculated by subtraction of the IC value from the TC the sample.  Another variant employs acidification of the sample to evolve carbon dioxide and measuring it as inorganic carbon (IC), then [[Redox|oxidizing]] and measuring the remaining non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC). This is called TIC-NPOC analysis. A more common method directly measures TOC in the sample by again acidifying the sample to a [[pH]] value of two or less to release the IC gas but in this case to the air not for measurement.  The remaining non-purgeable CO<sub>2</sub> gas (NPOC) contained in the liquid aliquot is then oxidized releasing the gases.  These gases are then sent to the detector for measurement.\n\nWhether the analysis of TOC is by TC-IC or NPOC methods, it may be broken into three main stages:\n#Acidification\n#Oxidation\n#Detection and Quantification\n\nThe first stage is acidification of the sample for the removal of the IC and POC gases.  The release of these gases to the detector for measurement or to the air is dependent upon which type of analysis is of interest, the former for TC-IC and the latter for TOC (NPOC).\n\n===Acidification===\nAddition of acid and inert-gas [[Sparging (chemistry)|sparging]] allows all bicarbonate and carbonate ions to be converted to carbon dioxide, and this IC product vented along with any POC that was present.\n\n===Oxidation===\nThe second stage is the oxidation of the carbon in the remaining sample in the form of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and other gases. Modern TOC analyzers perform this oxidation step by several processes:\n# High Temperature [[Combustion]]\n# High temperature [[Catalysis|catalytic]] oxidation (HTCO)\n# [[Photo-oxidation of polymers|Photo-oxidation]] alone\n# Thermo-chemical oxidation\n# [[Photochemistry|Photo-chemical]] oxidation\n# [[Electrolyte|Electrolytic]] Oxidation\n\n====High temperature combustion====\nPrepared samples are combusted at 1,200&nbsp;\u00b0C in an [[oxygen]]-rich atmosphere.

A carbon-free [[carrier gas]] transports the CO<sub>2</sub>, through a [[moisture]] trap and [[halide]] scrubbers to remove water vapor and halides from the gas stream before it reaches the detector. These substances can interfere with the detection of the CO<sub>2</sub> gas. The HTCO method may be useful in those applications where difficult to oxidize compounds, or high [[molecular weight]] organics, are present as it provides almost complete oxidation of organics including solids and particulates small enough to be injected into the furnace. The major drawback of HTCO analysis is its unstable baseline resulting from the gradual accumulation of non-[[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]] within the combustion tube. These residues continuously change TOC background levels requiring continuous background correction. Because [[Aqueous solution|aqueous]] samples are injected directly into a very hot, usually [[quartz]], furnace only small aliquots (less than 2 milliliters and usually less than 400 micro-liters) of sample can be handled making the methods less sensitive than chemical oxidation methods capable of digesting as much as 10 times more sample. Also, the [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] content of the samples do not combust, and so therefore, gradually build a residue inside the combustion tube eventually clogging the catalyst resulting in poor peak shapes, and degraded accuracy or precision, unless appropriate maintenance procedures are followed. The catalyst should be regenerated or replaced as needed. To avoid this problem the manufacturing industry has developed several concepts, such as matrix separation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elementar.de/en/products/toc-serie/vario-toc-select.html|title=vario TOC select|first=Elementar Analysensysteme|last=GmbH|date=6 September 2018|publisher=}}</ref> ceramic reactors,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lar.com/products/toc-analysis/toc-total-organic-carbon.html|title=TOC-Total Organic Carbon|date=22 August 2016|publisher=}}</ref> better process control or methods without catalysts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watertoday.org/Article%20Archieve/GE%20Analytics%202.pdf |title=Analytics |website=www.watertoday.org }}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n====Photo-oxidation (ultraviolet light)====\nIn this oxidation scheme, [[Ultraviolet|ultra-violet light]] alone oxidizes the carbon within the sample to produce CO<sub>2</sub>.

The mechanisms of the reactions are as follows:\n\nFree radical oxidants formed:\n\n<math>\\mathrm S_2\\mathrm O_8^{2-}\\underset{hv}{\\longrightarrow}2 \\ \\mathrm{SO}_4^{-\\bullet}</math>\n\n<math>\\mathrm H_2\\mathrm O\\underset{hv}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathrm H^++\\mathrm{OH}^\\bullet</math>{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n<math>\\mathrm{SO}_4^{-\\bullet}+\\mathrm H_2\\mathrm O\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}+\\mathrm{OH}^\\bullet+\\mathrm H^+</math>\n\nExcitation of organics:\n\n<math>\\mathrm R\\underset{hv}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathrm R^*</math>\n\nOxidation of organics:\n\n<math>\\mathrm R^*+\\mathrm{SO}_4^{-\\bullet}+\\mathrm{OH}^\\bullet\\longrightarrow n\\mathrm{CO}_2+\\dots</math>\n\nThe UV\u2013chemical oxidation method offers a relatively low maintenance, high sensitivity method for a wide range of applications. However, there are oxidation limitations of this method. Limitations include the inaccuracies associated with the addition of any foreign substance into the analyte and samples with high amounts of particulates.  Performing \"System Blank\" analysis, which is to analyze then subtract the amount of carbon contributed by the chemical additive, inaccuracies are lowered. However, analyses of levels below 200 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] TOC are still difficult.\n\n====Thermochemical persulfate oxidation====\nAlso known as heated persulfate, the method utilizes the same [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]] formation as UV persulfate oxidation except uses heat to magnify the oxidizing power of persulfate. Chemical oxidation of carbon with a strong oxidizer, such as persulfate, is highly efficient, and unlike UV, is not susceptible to lower recoveries caused by [[turbidity]] in samples. The analysis of system blanks, necessary in all chemical procedures, is especially necessary with heated persulfate TOC methods because the method is so sensitive that [[reagent]]s cannot be prepared with carbon contents low enough to not be detected. Persulfate methods are used in the analysis of wastewater, drinking water, and pharmaceutical waters. When used in conjunction with sensitive NDIR detectors heated persulfate TOC instruments readily measure TOC at single digit parts per billion (ppb) up to hundreds of parts per million (ppm) depending on sample volumes.\n\n===Detection and quantification===\nAccurate detection and quantification are the most vital components of the TOC analysis process. Conductivity and non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) are the two common detection methods used in modern TOC analyzers.\n\n====Conductivity====\nThere are two types of conductivity detectors, direct and membrane.\nDirect conductivity provides an all-encompassing approach of measuring CO<sub>2</sub>.  This detection method uses no carrier gas, is good at the parts per billion (ppb) ranges, but has a very limited analytical range.\nMembrane conductivity relies upon the filtering of the CO<sub>2</sub> prior to measuring it with a conductivity cell. Both methods analyze sample conductivity before and after oxidization, attributing this differential measurement to the TOC of the sample.  During the sample oxidization phase, CO<sub>2</sub> (directly related to the TOC in the sample) and other gases are formed. The dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> forms a weak acid, thereby changing the conductivity of the original sample proportionately to the TOC in the sample. Conductivity analyses assume that only CO<sub>2</sub> is present within the solution. As long as this holds true, then the TOC calculation by this differential measurement is valid.  However, depending on the chemical species present in the sample and their individual products of oxidation, they may present either a positive or a negative interference to the actual TOC value, resulting in analytical error.  Some of the interfering chemical species include Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>, SO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, and H<sup>+</sup>.   Small changes in pH and temperature fluctuations also contribute to inaccuracy.\nMembrane conductivity analyzers have improved upon the direct conductivity approach by incorporating the use of hydrophobic gas permeation membranes to allow a more \u201cselective\u201d passage of the dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> gas and nothing else. This provides a more precise and accurate measurement of the organics that were converted to CO<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2656.htm|title=ASTM E2656 - 16 Standard Practice for Real-time Release Testing of Pharmaceutical Water for the Total Organic Carbon Attribute|website=www.astm.org}}</ref>\n\n====Non-dispersive infrared (NDIR)====\nThe non-dispersive infrared analysis (NDIR) method offers the only practical interference-free method for detecting CO<sub>2</sub> in TOC analysis. The principal advantage of using NDIR is that it directly and specifically measures the CO<sub>2</sub> generated by oxidation of the organic carbon in the oxidation [[Chemical reactor|reactor]], rather than relying on a measurement of a secondary, corrected effect, such as used in conductivity measurements.\n\n[[File:Atmosfaerisk spredning.gif|thumb|Plot of atmospheric transmittance in part of IR region showing CO<sub>2</sub> absorbing wavelengths]]\n\nA traditional NDIR detector relies upon flow-through-cell technology, where the oxidation product flows into and out of the detector continuously.  A region of absorption of infrared light specific to CO<sub>2</sub>, usually around 4.26&nbsp;\u00b5m (2350&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>), is measured over time as the gas flows through the detector. A second reference measurement that is non-specific to CO<sub>2</sub> is also taken{{clarify|date=November 2016}}<!-- what wavelength or other method is used? --> and the differential result [[Correlation|correlates]] to the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the detector at that moment.  As the gas continues to flow into and out of the detector cell the sum of the measurements results in a peak that is [[Integral|integrated]] and correlated to the total CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the sample aliquot.\n\nA new advance of NDIR technology is Static Pressurized Concentration (SPC). The exit valve of the NDIR is closed to allow the detector to become pressurized.  Once the gases in the detector have reached [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], the concentration of the CO<sub>2</sub> is analyzed.  This pressurization of the sample gas stream in the NDIR, a patented technique, allows for increased sensitivity and precision by measuring the entirety of the oxidation products of the sample in one reading, compared to flow-through cell technology. The output signal is proportional to the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the carrier gas, from the oxidation of the sample aliquot. UV/ Persulfate oxidation combined with NDIR detection provides good oxidation of organics, low instrument maintenance, good precision at ppb levels, relatively fast sample analysis time and easily accommodates multiple applications, including purified water (PW), water for injection (WFI), CIP, drinking water and ultra-pure water analyses.\n\n==Analyzers==\nVirtually all TOC analyzers measure the CO<sub>2</sub> formed when organic carbon is oxidized and/or when inorganic carbon is acidified. [[Oxidation]] is performed either through [[Platinum group#Applications|Pt-catalyzed]] combustion, by heated persulfate, or with a [[UV]]/[[Sodium persulfate|persulfate]] reactor. Once the CO<sub>2</sub> is formed, it is measured by a detector: either a conductivity cell (if the CO<sub>2</sub> is aqueous) or a non-dispersive infrared cell (after purging the aqueous CO<sub>2</sub> into the gaseous phase). Conductivity detection is only desirable in the lower TOC ranges in deionized waters, whereas NDIR detection excels in all TOC ranges.  A variation described as [http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2656.htm Membrane Conductometric Detection] can allow for measurement of TOC across a wide analytical range in both deionized and non-deionized water samples.  Modern high-performance TOC instruments are capable of detecting carbon concentrations well below 1&nbsp;\u00b5g/L (1 part per billion or ppb).\n\nA total organic carbon analyzer determines the amount of carbon in a water sample. By acidifying the sample and flushing with nitrogen or helium the sample removes inorganic carbon, leaving only organic carbon sources for measurement. There are two types of analyzers. One uses combustion and the other chemical oxidation. This is used as a water purity test, as the presence of bacteria introduces organic carbon.\n\n===Analyzer field testing and Reports===\n\nA non-profit research and testing organization, the Instrumentation Testing Association (ITA) can provide results of field testing online TOC analyzers in an industrial wastewater application.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.instrument.org/about.htm|title=About ITA|website=www.instrument.org}}</ref> Gulf Coast Waste Disposal Authority (GCWDA), Bayport Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant in Pasadena, Texas sponsored and conducted this test in 2011. The GCWDA Bayport facility treats approximately 30 mgd of industrial waste received from approximately 65 customers (primarily petrochemical). Field tests consisted of operating online TOC analyzers at the influent of the Bayport facility in which TOC concentrations can range from 490 to 1020&nbsp;mg/L with an average of 870&nbsp;mg/L. GCWDA conducts approximately 102 TOC analyses in their laboratory per day at their Bayport treatment facility and use TOC measurements for process control and billing purposes. GCWDA plans to use online TOC analyzers for process control, detecting influent slug loads from industries and to potentially use online TOC analyzers to detect and monitor volatiles of the incoming stream. Field tests were conducted for a period of 90-days and used laboratory conformance measurements once per day to compare with analyzer output to demonstrate the instrument's overall accuracy when subjected to many simultaneously changing parameters as experienced in real-time monitoring conditions. Field test results can provide information regarding instrument design, operation and maintenance requirements which influence the performance of the instruments in field applications. The field test report includes evaluations of online TOC analyzers utilizing the following technologies: High Temperature Combustion (HTC), High Temperature Catalytic/Combustion Oxidation (HTCO), Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO), and Two-Stage Advanced Oxidation (TSAO).\n\n===Combustion===\nIn a combustion analyzer, half of the sample is injected into a chamber where it is acidified, usually with phosphoric acid, to turn all of the inorganic carbon into carbon dioxide as per the following reaction:{{clarify|date=November 2016}}\n\n: CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O \u21cc H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> \u21ccH<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> \u21cc 2H<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>\n\nThis is then sent to a detector for measurement. The other half of the sample is injected into a combustion chamber which is raised to between 600\u2013700&nbsp;\u00b0C, some even up to 1200&nbsp;\u00b0C. Here, all the carbon reacts with oxygen, forming carbon dioxide. It's then flushed into a cooling chamber, and finally into the detector. Usually, the detector used is a non-dispersive infrared [[spectrophotometer]]. By finding the total inorganic carbon and subtracting it from the total carbon content, the amount of organic carbon is determined.\n\n===Chemical oxidation===\nChemical oxidation analyzers inject the sample into a chamber with phosphoric acid followed by persulfate. The analysis is separated into two steps. One removes inorganic carbon by acidification and purging. After removal of inorganic carbon persulfate is added and the sample is either heated or bombarded with UV light from a mercury vapor lamp. Free radicals form persulfate and react with any carbon available to form carbon dioxide. The carbon from both determination (steps) is either run through membranes which measure the [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] changes that result from the presence of varying amounts of carbon dioxide, or purged into and detected by a sensitive NDIR detector. Same as the combustion analyzer, the total carbon formed minus the inorganic carbon gives a good estimate of the total organic carbon in the sample.\nThis method is often used in online applications because of its low maintenance requirements.\n\n==Applications==\nTOC is the first chemical analysis to be carried out on potential petroleum [[source rock]] in [[oil exploration]].  It is very important in detecting contaminants in drinking water, cooling water, water used in semiconductor manufacturing, and water for pharmaceutical use<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mt.com/us/en/home/library/guides/process-analytics/pure-water-guide.html |title=Pure Water Guide: Regulations and Standards Overview for Quality Assurance |website=www.mt.com}}</ref>.  Analysis may be made either as an online continuous measurement or a lab-based measurement.\n\nTOC detection is an important measurement because of the effects it may have on the environment, human health, and manufacturing processes.  TOC is a highly sensitive, non-specific measurement of all organics present in a sample.  It, therefore, can be used to regulate the organic chemical discharge to the environment in a manufacturing plant. In addition, low TOC can confirm the absence of potentially harmful organic chemicals in water used to manufacture pharmaceutical products.  TOC is also of interest in the field of potable [[water purification#Tertiary treatment|water purification]] due to byproducts of disinfection.  Inorganic carbon poses little to no threat.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Total Organic Carbon}}\n[[Category:Carbon]]\n[[Category:Soil tests]]\n[[Category:Water pollution]]\n[[Category:Water quality indicators]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_organic_carbon"}
{"title_page": "Tosafot", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Tosefta}}\n\n[[File:First page of the first tractate of the Talmud (Daf Beis of Maseches Brachos).jpg|thumb|The first page of the [[Vilna]] Edition of the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Berachot, folio 2a.  <br />The main text in the middle is the text of the Talmud itself.  To the right, on the inner margin of the page, is Rashi's commentary; to the left, on the outer margin, the Tosafot]]\nThe '''Tosafot,''' '''Tosafos''' or Tosfot ({{lang-he-n|\u05ea\u05d5\u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea}}) are [[Middle Ages|medieval]] commentaries on the [[Talmud]]. They take the form of critical and explanatory glosses, printed, in almost all Talmud editions, on the outer margin and opposite [[Rashi]]'s notes.\n\nThe authors of the Tosafot are known as '''Tosafists''' ({{Hebrew|\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea}} ''Ba'ale haTosafot''); for a listing see ''[[List of Tosafists]]''.\n\n==Meaning of name==\nThe word ''tosafos'' literally means \"additions\". The reason for the title is a matter of dispute among modern schoars.\n\nMany of them, including [[Heinrich Graetz]], think the glosses are so-called as additions to [[Rashi]]'s commentary on the Talmud. In fact, the period of the Tosafot began immediately after Rashi had written his commentary; the first tosafists were Rashi's sons-in-law and grandsons, and the Tosafot consist mainly of strictures on Rashi's commentary.\n\nOthers, especially [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]], object that many tosafot&nbsp;\u2014 particularly those of [[Isaiah di Trani]]&nbsp;\u2014 have no reference to Rashi. Weiss, followed by other scholars, asserts that ''tosafot'' means additions to ''the Talmud'', that is to say, they are an extension and development of the Talmud. For just as the [[Gemara]] is a critical and analytical commentary on the [[Mishnah]], so are the Tosafot critical and analytical glosses on those two parts of the Talmud. Further, the term ''tosafot'' was not applied for the first time to the glosses of Rashi's continuators, but to the [[Tosefta]], the additions to the [[Mishnah]] compiled by [[Judah ha-Nasi]] I. ''Tosefta'' is a [[Babylon]]ian term, which in [[Jerusalem]] writings is replaced by ''tosafot''.<ref>See [[Jerusalem Talmud|Yer.]] Pe'ah ii. 17a; Lev. R. xxx. 2; Cant. R. vi. 9; Eccl. R. v. 8.</ref> The Tosafot resemble the [[Gemara]] in other respects also, for just as the latter is the work of different schools carried on through a long period, so the former were written at different times and by different schools, and gathered later into one body.\n\n==Character==\nUp to and including Rashi, the Talmudic commentators occupied themselves only with the plain meaning (\"pesha\u1e6d\") of the text; but after the beginning of the twelfth century the spirit of criticism took possession of the teachers of the Talmud. Thus some of Rashi's continuators, as his sons-in-law and his grandson [[Rashbam|Samuel ben Me\u00efr]] (RaSHBaM), while they wrote commentaries on the Talmud after the manner of Rashi's, wrote also glosses on it in a style peculiar to themselves.\n\nThe Tosafot do not constitute a continuous commentary, but rather (like the \"Dissensiones\" to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis#Codex Justinianus|Roman Code]] of the first quarter of the twelfth century) deal only with difficult passages of the Talmud. Single sentences are explained by quotations which are taken from other Talmudic treatises and which seem at first glance to have no connection with the sentences in question. On the other hand, sentences which seem to be related and interdependent are separated and embodied in different treatises. The Tosafot can be understood only by those who are well advanced in the study of the Talmud, for the most entangled discussions are treated as though they were simple. Glosses explaining the meaning of a word or containing a [[grammar|grammatical]] observation are very rare.\n\nThe Tosafot may be considered from the point of view of a methodology of the Talmud. The rules are certainly not gathered together in one series, as they are, for instance, in [[Maimonides]]' introduction to the Mishnah; they are scattered in various parts, and their number is quite considerable. Neither are they stated in fixed terms; a generally accepted rule is followed by \"This is the way of the Talmud\" or \"The Talmud usually declares.\" Sometimes the negative expression is found, \"This is not the way of the Talmud.\" A frequently recurring rule is indicated by some such formula as \"We find many like this.\"\n\nThe above description concerns the general features of the Tosafot; nevertheless, the writings of different tosafists differ somewhat in style and method. With regard to method, it should be said that the [[#Tosafot of Touques|Tosafot of Touques]] (see below) concern particularly the casuistic interpretation of the traditional law, but do not touch halakhic decisions.\n\nIn spite of the great respect in which Rashi was held by the Tosafists, the latter freely corrected him.\n\n==History==\n\nThe chief home of tosafot literature was incontestably France, for it began with Rashi's pupils, and was continued mainly by the heads of the French schools. While tosafot began to be written in Germany at the same time as in France, the French tosafists always predominated numerically. The first tosafot recorded are those written by Rashi's two sons-in-law, [[Me\u00efr b. Samuel]] of Ramerupt (RaM) and [[Judah ben Nathan]] (RIBaN), and by a certain R. Joseph.<ref>Jacob Tam, \"Sefer ha-Yashar,\" No. 252; \"Haggahot Mordechai,\" Sanhedrin, No. 696; see below</ref> But their tosafot not being otherwise known, the actual father of the tosafot in France was undoubtedly Jacob b. Meir, known colloquially as Rabbeinu Tam, whose style was adopted by his successors. He wrote a great number of tosafot, many of which are to be found in his \"Sefer ha-Yashar\"; but not all, as many passages that are cited in the edited tosafot are not found in the work just mentioned. In Germany, at the same time, flourished [[Isaac ben Asher ha-Levi]] (RIBA), leader of the German tosafists, who wrote numerous tosafot, which are mentioned by [[Abraham ben David]] (\"Temim De'im,\" Nos. 158, 207-209), and which are very often cited in the edited tosafot.<ref>e.g., to So\u1e6dah 17b</ref> But Isaac ben Asher's tosafot were revised by his pupils, who, according to Rabbeinu Tam,<ref>\"Sefer ha-Yashar,\" No. 282</ref> sometimes ascribed to their teacher opinions which were not his. [[Zedekiah ben Abraham Anaw|Zedekiah ben Abraham]],<ref>\"Shibbolei HaLeket,\" 1:225</ref> however, refutes Rabbeinu Tam's assertion.\n\nThe most prominent tosafist immediately after Rabbeinu Tam was his pupil and relative [[Isaac ben Samuel ha-Za\u1e33en]] (RI) of Dampierre, whose tosafot form a part of the Tosafot Yeshanim (see below). Isaac was succeeded by his pupil [[Samson ben Abraham of Sens]] (R\"SH) (d. about 1235), who, besides enriching the literature with his own compositions, revised those of his predecessors, especially his teacher's, and compiled them into the group known as the [[#Tosafot of Sens|Tosafot of Sens]]. Samson's fellow pupil [[Judah Messer Leon (1166)|Judah b. Isaac of Paris]] (Sir Leon) was also very active; he wrote tosafot to several Talmudic treatises, of which those to Berakhot were published at Warsaw (1863); some of those to 'Abodah Zarah are extant in manuscript. Among the many French tosafists deserving special mention was [[Samuel ben Solomon of Falaise]] (Sir Morel), who, owing to the destruction of the Talmud in France in his time, relied for the text entirely upon his memory.<ref>[[Meir of Rothenburg]], Responsa, No. 250</ref>\n\nThe edited tosafot owe their existence particularly to Samson of Sens and to the following French tosafists of the thirteenth century: (1) [[Moses of \u00c9vreux]], (2) [[Eliezer of Touques]], and (3) [[Perez ben Elijah]] of Corbeil.\n\nIt has been said that the first German tosafist, Isaac b. Asher ha-Levi, was the head of a school, and that his pupils, besides composing tosafot of their own, revised his. In the thirteenth century the German schools were represented by [[Baruch ben Isaac]], in Regensburg, and later by [[Meir of Rothenburg]] (MaHaRaM); the Italian school was represented by [[Isaiah di Trani]]. If the tosafot of [[Asher b. Jehiel]] (RoSH) (d. 1328) are to be included, the tosafistic period extended through more than two centuries. When the fanaticism of the French monasteries and the bigotry of [[Louis IX]] brought about the destruction of the Talmud, the writing of tosafot in France soon ceased.\n\n===Overview===\nEach generation of Tosafists would add to the compiled glosses, and therefore there are many different versions of the ''Tosafot''. In addition, each compilation of the ''Tosafos'' did not contain everything that was said by the ''Tosafists'' on the subject so compilations will differ in what they say. Therefore, some things that were said by the ''Tosafists'' will be found only in obscure versions of the ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Publication===\nThe final version of these commentaries was published on the outer side of the pages of the Soncino edition of the Talmud, printed in [[Soncino, Lombardy|Soncino]], Italy (16th century), and was the first printed edition of the full Talmud. The publisher of that edition was a nephew of Rabbi Moshe of Spires (Shapiro) who was of the last generation of ''Tosafists'' and who initiated a project of writing a final compilation of the ''Tosafos''. Before he published his Talmud he traveled throughout France to the schools where the ''Tosafists'' learned and gathered all of the different manuscripts of that final version of the ''Tosafos'' and printed them in his Talmud. Since then every publication of the Talmud was printed with the ''Tosafos'' on the outer side of the page (the inner side has the commentary of Rashi) and is an integral part of the study of the Talmud.\n===The burning of the Talmud===\nDuring the period of the ''Tosafists'' the church enacted a law that prohibited possession of the Talmud under pain of death and [[Disputation of Paris#Outcome|24 wagon loads of scrolls of the Talmud were gathered from all of France and burned in the center of Paris]]. The intention of the church was that the study of the Talmud should be forgotten and once forgotten it would remain forgotten for all generations since there would be nobody to teach it. As a result, the ''Tosafists'' devised a system where they could study the Talmud without the existence of a text despite the vastness of the Talmud. They appointed scholars, each to be expert in one the volumes of the Talmud, to know it by heart and very well, and so through these scholars they would have expertise and knowledge in all of the Talmud. As they would study a particular text in one volume of the Talmud those scholars who were expert in different volumes of the Talmud would tell of anything in the volume of the Talmud that they were expert on that would contradict their understanding of the text at hand. Thus an important aspect of the scholarship of the ''Tosafists'' is to use texts in different areas of the Talmud to disprove certain interpretations of the Talmud (often those of Rashi) and to determine the correct way to understand the Talmud.\n\n==Authorities cited==\n\nThe Tosafot quote principally [[Rashi]] (very often under the designation \"\u1e33on\u1e6dres\" [= \"pamphlet\", Rashi initially published his commentary in pamphlets]), many of the ancient authorities (as [[Kalonymus of Lucca]], [[Nathan b. Jehiel]], and [[R. Hananeel]]), some contemporary scholars (as [[Abraham b. David of Posqui\u00e8res]], [[Maimonides]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], and others), and about 130 German and French Talmudists of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Many of the last-named are known as authors of general Talmudic works, as, for instance, [[Eliezer b. Nathan]] of Mainz, [[Judah of Corbeil]], and [[Jacob of Coucy]]; but many of them are known only through their being quoted in the Tosafot, as in the case of an [[Eliezer of Sens]], a [[Jacob of Orleans]], and many Abrahams and Isaacs. Some are mentioned just once, including Eliezer of \"Pelire\" [Falaise? Montpellier?]<ref>Tosafot Bava Batra 79b</ref>, Ephraim b. David<ref>Supposed contemporary of [[Judah Sir Leon]]; Tosafot 'Abodah Zarah 39a</ref>, and one Hezekiah.<ref>Tosafot Bava Batra 44b</ref> A commentary on the Pentateuch entitled \"Da'at Ze\u1e33enim\" (Leghorn, 1783) is attributed to the Tosafists. In form this commentary follows the style of the Tosafot; Rashi is often discussed, and sometimes corrected.\n\n==Schools of Tosafists==\n{{See also|List of Tosafists}}\n\n===Tosafot of Sens===\n\nThe earliest collection, compiled by [[Samson ben Abraham of Sens]].  It was one of the main sources for the [[#Tosafot of Touques|Tosafot of Touques]], which in turn underlies the present printed Tosafot (\"[[#The Edited Tosafot (called also Our Tosafot)|Tosafot shelanu]]\").  Passages from the Tosafot of Sens which did not find their way into the main collection are sometimes printed under the title of [[#Tosafot Yeshanim (\"Tosafot of the Ancients\")|Tosafot Yeshanim]].\n\n===Tosafot of \u00c9vreux===\n\n[[Moses of \u00c9vreux]], one of the most prolific tosafists, furnished glosses to the whole Talmud; they form a distinct group known as the Tosafot of [[\u00c9vreux]]. It may be presumed that the \"Tosafot of R. Moses\" mentioned by [[Mordechai ben Hillel]]<ref>\"Mordechai,\" on Sanhedrin, No. 937</ref> are identical with the tosafot just mentioned. According to [[Joseph Colon]]<ref>Responsa, No. 52</ref> and [[Elijah Mizra\u1e25i]],<ref>\"Mayim Amukim,\" 1:37</ref> Moses wrote his glosses on the margin of [[Isaac Alfasi]]'s \"Halakhot,\" probably at the time of the burning of the Talmud.\n\n===Tosafot of Touques===\n\n[[Eliezer of Touques]], of the second half of the thirteenth century, made a compendium of the Tosafot of Sens and of \u00c9vreux; this compendium is called the Tosafot of Touques, and forms the basis of the edited tosafot. Eliezer's own glosses, written on the margin, are known as the Tosafot Gillayon or Gilyon Tosafot. It must be premised, however, that the Tosafot of Touques did not remain untouched; they were revised afterward and supplemented by the glosses of later tosafists. Gershon Soncino, who printed these tosafot, declares that his ancestor Moses of F\u00fcrth, who lived in the middle of the fifteenth century, was a descendant in the fifth generation of Moses of Speyer, who is mentioned in the Tosafot of Touques. It is supposed that the last redactor of these tosafot was a pupil of Samson of Chinon.\n\n===Tosafot of Perez ben Elijah's Pupils===\n\n[[Perez ben Elijah]] of Corbeil was one of the most active of the later tosafists. Besides supplying tosafot to several treatises, which are quoted by many old authorities and are included among the edited tosafot (and many of which were seen in manuscript by Azulai), he revised those of his predecessors. His pupils were not less active; their additions are known as the Tosafot of Perez b. Elijah's Pupils.\n\n===Other bodies of tosafot===\n\n====French Tosafot====\nMentioned in the novellae on Tamid ascribed to [[Abraham b. David]]. Zunz<ref>\"Z.G.\" p.&nbsp;57</ref> thinks that the Tosafot of Sens may be referred to under this title; but the fact that Abraham b. David was much earlier than Samson of Sens leads to the supposition that the glosses indicated are those of previous tosafists, as Rabbeinu Tam, Isaac b. Asher ha-Levi, and Isaac b. Samuel ha-Za\u1e33en and his son.\n\n====Pis\u1e33e Tosafot (\"Decisions of the Tosafot\")====\nCollection of halakic decisions gathered from the edited tosafot to thirty-six treatises\u2014''Nazir'' and ''Me'ilah'' being excepted\u2014and generally printed in the margin of the Tosafot; in the later editions of the Talmud, after the text. These decisions number 5,931; of these 2,009 belong to the tractate''Berakot'' and the order ''Mo'ed''; 1,398 to ''Niddah'' and the order ''Nashim''; 1,503 to ''Nezi\u1e33in''; and 1,021 to ''\u1e32odashim''. The decisions contained in the tosafot to ''Shabbat'', ''Pesa\u1e25im'', ''Gi\u1e6d\u1e6din'', ''Ketubot'', ''Baba \u1e32amma'', ''Baba Me\u1e93i'a'', ''Baba Batra'', and ''\u1e24ullin'' number fully one-half of those recognized as authoritative. The compiler of these decisions can not be identified with certainty; [[Asher b. Jehiel]], his son [[Jacob b. Asher]], and Ezekiel, uncle of [[Eliezer of Touques]], are given by different authorities. [[Jacob Nordhausen]], also, is known to have compiled tosafot decisions; in fact, references to two groups of ''Pis\u1e33e Tosafot'' are found in the works of the later commentators.\n\n====Spanish Tosafot====\nThis term is used by [[Joseph Colon]]<ref>Responsa, No. 72</ref> and by [[Jacob Baruch Landau]]<ref>\"Agur,\" \u00a7 327</ref> and may apply to Talmudic novellae by Spanish authors. [[Jeshuah b. Joseph ha-Levi]], for instance, applies the term \"tosafot\" to the novellae of [[Isaac ben Sheshet]].<ref>\"Halikhot Olam,\" \u00a7 327</ref>\n\n====The Edited Tosafot (called also Our Tosafot)====\nThe tosafot which have been published with the text of the Talmud ever since its earliest edition (see [[Talmud#Printing|Talmud, Editions of]]). They extend to thirty-eight treatises of the Babylonian Talmud. Most of the treatises are covered by the Tosafot of Touques, some by the Tosafot of Sens; many are provided with the tosafot of various authors, revised by Perez b. Elijah's school. The authorship of the tosafot to seventeen treatises only can be established with certainty:\n* ''Berakot'': [[Moses of \u00c9vreux]];\n* ''Shabbat'', '' 'Erubin'', and ''Mena\u1e25ot'': the Tosafot of Sens;\n* ''Be\u1e93ah'', ''Nedarim'', ''Nazir'', ''Sanhedrin'', ''Makkot'', and ''Me'ilah'': [[Perez b. Elijah]]'s school (many written by Perez himself);\n* ''Yoma'': [[Me\u00efr of Rothenburg]];\n* ''Gi\u1e6d\u1e6din'', ''Baba \u1e32amma'', and ''\u1e24ullin'': the Tosafot of Touques;\n* ''So\u1e6dah'': [[Samuel of \u00c9vreux]];\n* '' 'Avodah Zarah'': [[Samuel of Falaise]];\n* ''Zeba\u1e25im'': [[Baruch b. Isaac of Worms]].\n\nThe tosafot to ''Mo'ed \u1e32a\u1e6don'' were written by a pupil of a certain R. Isaac; the author of the tosafot to ''\u1e24agigah'' wrote tosafot to other treatises also. Those to ''Ta'anit'' belong to the post-tosafot period, and differ in style from those to other treatises.\n\n====Tosafot Alfasi====\nQuoted by [[Joseph Colon]] (Responsa, Nos. 5, 31) and [[Judah Minz]] (Responsa, No. 10). The term may designate either the tosafot of [[Samuel b. Me\u00efr]] and [[Moses of \u00c9vreux]], or glosses to [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi]]'s ''Halakot''.\n\n====Tosafot of Gornish====\nMentioned by [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]]<ref>''Nobelot Chochmah,'' Preface</ref> and [[Solomon Algazi]],<ref>''Gufei Halakhot,'' No. 195</ref> the latter quoting these tosafot to [[Bava kamma]]. But as the same quotation is made by [[Betzalel Ashkenazi]]<ref>''Shitah Mekubetzet'' to Bava Kamma</ref> and ascribed to a pupil of [[Perez ben Elijah]], [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai|Azulai]]<ref>''Shem ha-Gedolim,'' ii.</ref> concludes that these tosafot originated in Perez b. Elijah's school. Still, [[Mordecai ben Hillel]]<ref>''Mordekhai,'' [[Bava Batra]], No. 886</ref> mentions a R. Judah of Gornish, and [[Abraham ibn Akra]]<ref>''Meharerei Nemerim,'' Venice, 1599</ref> reproduces Talmudic novellae by \"M. of Gornish\" (Embden gives \"Me\u00efr of Gornish\" in the Latin translation of the catalogue of the Oppenheim Library, No. 667). Manuscript No. 7 of the G\u00fcnzburg collection bears the superscription \"Tosafot of Gornish to Yebamot,\" and in these tosafot French and German rabbis are quoted. Manuscript No. 603 of the same collection contains also the Tosafot of Gornish and novellae by [[Judah Minz]], and fragments of Gornish tosafot are found in manuscripts in other libraries.\n\nDifferent theories have been advanced with regard to the name \"Gornish.\" According to [[S. Schechter]],<ref>''Jew. Chron.'' May 4, 1888</ref> it is a corruption of \"[[Mayence]]\", while H. Adler thinks it a corruption of  \"Norwich\".<ref>See [[A. Neubauer]] in ''R. E. J.'' xvii. 156, and [[Henri Gross]], ''Gallia Judaica,'' pp. 136 et seq.</ref> Gross (l.c.) thinks that Gornish may be identical with Gournay, in France, and that \"M. of Gornish,\" apparently the author of the Tosafot of Gornish, may be Moses of Gornish and identical with the Moses of \u05d2\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05e5 mentioned in the Tosafot of Sens (to [[Pesa\u1e25im]]). It may be added that in the supplement to [[Zacuto]]'s ''Yu\u1e25asin''<ref>p.&nbsp;164a, Cracow, 1581</ref> a David of \"Durnish\" occurs.\n\n====Tosafot \u1e24i\u1e93oniyyot (\"Exterior\" or \"Uncanonical Tosafot\")====\nTosafot which are neither of Sens nor of Touques. They are so called by [[Betzalel Ashkenazi]]; he included many fragments of them in his ''Shitah Mekubetzet'', to ''Bava Metzia'', ''Nazir'', etc.\n\n====Tosafot Shi\u1e6d\u1e6dah (or Shi\u1e6d\u1e6dah)====\nName sometimes applied to the recensions of [[Perez b. Elijah]] or to the tosafot of [[Jehiel of Paris]].<ref>Bezalel Ashkenazi, l.c.; notes to \"Sha'are Dura,\" \u00a7 57; and many other authorities</ref>\n\n====Tosafot Yeshanim (\"Tosafot of the Ancients\")====\nThis group comprises four smaller ones: (1) the general tosafot of Sens, including those appearing among the edited tosafot; (2) the earlier unedited tosafot (for example, those to \u1e32iddushin by Isaac b. Samuel haZaken of Dampierre, and those to Avodah Zarah by his son Elhanan b. Isaac); these sometimes appear separately under the title of '''Tosafot ha-Ri'''; (3) a collection of old tosafot published by Joseph Jessel b. Wolf ha-Levi in \"Sugyot ha-Shas\" (Berlin, 1736); (4) various tosafot found in ancient manuscripts, as the tosafot to Chullin written in 1360, the manuscript of which is in the Munich Library (No. 236). In the collection published by Joseph Jessel b. Wolf haLevi (No. 3), besides the old tosafot to Yoma by [[Moses of Coucy]],<ref>Compare, however, [[Israel Isserlein]], \"Terumat haDeshen,\" No. 94, who declares they belong to the Tosafot of Sens</ref> there are single tosafot to sixteen treatises\u2014Shabbat, Rosh HaShanah, Megillah, Gittin, Bava Metzia, Mena\u1e25ot, Bechorot, Eruvin, Beitzah, Ketubot, Kiddushin, Nazir, Bava Batra, Horayot, Keritot, and Niddah. In the [[Vilna Edition Shas|Vilna edition of the Talmud]] edited by [[Romm publishing house|Romm]], the \"old tosafot\" to several treatises are printed.\n\n====Tosafot ha-Rid====\n\nBy Rabbi [[Isaiah di Trani]].\n\n====Tosafot Hachmei Anglia====\n{{See also|Tosafot Hachmei Anglia}}\nA small collection of tosafot composed by rabbis from England.\n\n====Tosafot ha-Rosh====\n\nA commentary in tosafot style, and largely dependent on the earlier tosafot collections, composed by [[Asher ben Jehiel]].  These, together with the Hiddushim of [[Nahmanides]] and others, were studied by the [[Sephardi Jews]] instead of the normal Tosafot.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Tosafot collections===\nThe [[#The Edited Tosafot (called also Our Tosafot)|Tosafot shelanu]] are printed in most Talmud editions, in the column farther from the binding.  The Vilna edition also includes tosafot from other collections, such as Tosafot Yeshanim, Tosafot ha-Ri and Tosafot ha-Rid on a few tractates. The [[#Pis\u1e33e Tosafot (\"Decisions of the Tosafot\")|Piske Tosafot]] (decisions of the Tosafot) are printed at the end of each tractate.\n\nComplete sets of the [[#Tosafot ha-Rosh|Tosafot ha-Rosh]] and the [[#Tosafot of Perez ben Elijah's Pupils|Tosafot of Rabbi Peretz]] are published separately, as are individual volumes from the Tosafot Yeshanim and a few others.  The most recent editions of the Talmud, such as the Friedmann edition published by Oz we-Hadar, incorporate these collections at the back of each volume, in a synoptic fashion. Most of the other collections remain in manuscript or in the form of quotations in later works.\n\n===Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography===\n* [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai|Chaim Azulai]], Shem ha-Gedolim, ii.\n* [[Isaac Benjacob]], O\u1e93ar ha-Sefarim, pp.&nbsp;621 et seq.\n* Buchholz, in Monatsschrift, xxxviii. 342, 398, 450, 559\n* [[Heinrich Gr\u00e4tz]], Gesch. 3d ed., vi. 143-144, 210; vii. 108-110\n* [[Gustav Karpeles]], Gesch. der J\u00fcdischen Literatur, i. 574 et seq.\n* [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]], Dor, iv. 336-352\n* idem, Toledot Rabbenu Tam, pp.&nbsp;2\u20134\n* Winter and W\u00fcnsche, J\u00fcdische Literatur, ii. 465 et seq.\n* [[Leopold Zunz]] (the chief source for this article), Zur Geschichte und Literatur (1845), pp.&nbsp;29 et seq.\n\n===Other secondary literature===\n* Urbach, E.

To the right, on the inner margin of the page, is Rashi's commentary; to the left, on the outer margin, the Tosafot]]\nThe '''Tosafot,''' '''Tosafos''' or Tosfot ({{lang-he-n|\u05ea\u05d5\u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea}}) are [[Middle Ages|medieval]] commentaries on the [[Talmud]]. They take the form of critical and explanatory glosses, printed, in almost all Talmud editions, on the outer margin and opposite [[Rashi]]'s notes.\n\nThe authors of the Tosafot are known as '''Tosafists''' ({{Hebrew|\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea}} ''Ba'ale haTosafot''); for a listing see ''[[List of Tosafists]]''.\n\n==Meaning of name==\nThe word ''tosafos'' literally means \"additions\". The reason for the title is a matter of dispute among modern schoars.\n\nMany of them, including [[Heinrich Graetz]], think the glosses are so-called as additions to [[Rashi]]'s commentary on the Talmud. In fact, the period of the Tosafot began immediately after Rashi had written his commentary; the first tosafists were Rashi's sons-in-law and grandsons, and the Tosafot consist mainly of strictures on Rashi's commentary.\n\nOthers, especially [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]], object that many tosafot&nbsp;\u2014 particularly those of [[Isaiah di Trani]]&nbsp;\u2014 have no reference to Rashi. Weiss, followed by other scholars, asserts that ''tosafot'' means additions to ''the Talmud'', that is to say, they are an extension and development of the Talmud. For just as the [[Gemara]] is a critical and analytical commentary on the [[Mishnah]], so are the Tosafot critical and analytical glosses on those two parts of the Talmud. Further, the term ''tosafot'' was not applied for the first time to the glosses of Rashi's continuators, but to the [[Tosefta]], the additions to the [[Mishnah]] compiled by [[Judah ha-Nasi]] I. ''Tosefta'' is a [[Babylon]]ian term, which in [[Jerusalem]] writings is replaced by ''tosafot''.<ref>See [[Jerusalem Talmud|Yer.]] Pe'ah ii. 17a; Lev. R. xxx. 2; Cant. R. vi. 9; Eccl. R. v. 8.</ref> The Tosafot resemble the [[Gemara]] in other respects also, for just as the latter is the work of different schools carried on through a long period, so the former were written at different times and by different schools, and gathered later into one body.\n\n==Character==\nUp to and including Rashi, the Talmudic commentators occupied themselves only with the plain meaning (\"pesha\u1e6d\") of the text; but after the beginning of the twelfth century the spirit of criticism took possession of the teachers of the Talmud. Thus some of Rashi's continuators, as his sons-in-law and his grandson [[Rashbam|Samuel ben Me\u00efr]] (RaSHBaM), while they wrote commentaries on the Talmud after the manner of Rashi's, wrote also glosses on it in a style peculiar to themselves.\n\nThe Tosafot do not constitute a continuous commentary, but rather (like the \"Dissensiones\" to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis#Codex Justinianus|Roman Code]] of the first quarter of the twelfth century) deal only with difficult passages of the Talmud. Single sentences are explained by quotations which are taken from other Talmudic treatises and which seem at first glance to have no connection with the sentences in question. On the other hand, sentences which seem to be related and interdependent are separated and embodied in different treatises. The Tosafot can be understood only by those who are well advanced in the study of the Talmud, for the most entangled discussions are treated as though they were simple. Glosses explaining the meaning of a word or containing a [[grammar|grammatical]] observation are very rare.\n\nThe Tosafot may be considered from the point of view of a methodology of the Talmud. The rules are certainly not gathered together in one series, as they are, for instance, in [[Maimonides]]' introduction to the Mishnah; they are scattered in various parts, and their number is quite considerable. Neither are they stated in fixed terms; a generally accepted rule is followed by \"This is the way of the Talmud\" or \"The Talmud usually declares.\" Sometimes the negative expression is found, \"This is not the way of the Talmud.\" A frequently recurring rule is indicated by some such formula as \"We find many like this.\"\n\nThe above description concerns the general features of the Tosafot; nevertheless, the writings of different tosafists differ somewhat in style and method. With regard to method, it should be said that the [[#Tosafot of Touques|Tosafot of Touques]] (see below) concern particularly the casuistic interpretation of the traditional law, but do not touch halakhic decisions.\n\nIn spite of the great respect in which Rashi was held by the Tosafists, the latter freely corrected him.\n\n==History==\n\nThe chief home of tosafot literature was incontestably France, for it began with Rashi's pupils, and was continued mainly by the heads of the French schools. While tosafot began to be written in Germany at the same time as in France, the French tosafists always predominated numerically. The first tosafot recorded are those written by Rashi's two sons-in-law, [[Me\u00efr b. Samuel]] of Ramerupt (RaM) and [[Judah ben Nathan]] (RIBaN), and by a certain R. Joseph.<ref>Jacob Tam, \"Sefer ha-Yashar,\" No. 252; \"Haggahot Mordechai,\" Sanhedrin, No. 696; see below</ref> But their tosafot not being otherwise known, the actual father of the tosafot in France was undoubtedly Jacob b. Meir, known colloquially as Rabbeinu Tam, whose style was adopted by his successors. He wrote a great number of tosafot, many of which are to be found in his \"Sefer ha-Yashar\"; but not all, as many passages that are cited in the edited tosafot are not found in the work just mentioned. In Germany, at the same time, flourished [[Isaac ben Asher ha-Levi]] (RIBA), leader of the German tosafists, who wrote numerous tosafot, which are mentioned by [[Abraham ben David]] (\"Temim De'im,\" Nos. 158, 207-209), and which are very often cited in the edited tosafot.<ref>e.g., to So\u1e6dah 17b</ref> But Isaac ben Asher's tosafot were revised by his pupils, who, according to Rabbeinu Tam,<ref>\"Sefer ha-Yashar,\" No. 282</ref> sometimes ascribed to their teacher opinions which were not his. [[Zedekiah ben Abraham Anaw|Zedekiah ben Abraham]],<ref>\"Shibbolei HaLeket,\" 1:225</ref> however, refutes Rabbeinu Tam's assertion.\n\nThe most prominent tosafist immediately after Rabbeinu Tam was his pupil and relative [[Isaac ben Samuel ha-Za\u1e33en]] (RI) of Dampierre, whose tosafot form a part of the Tosafot Yeshanim (see below). Isaac was succeeded by his pupil [[Samson ben Abraham of Sens]] (R\"SH) (d. about 1235), who, besides enriching the literature with his own compositions, revised those of his predecessors, especially his teacher's, and compiled them into the group known as the [[#Tosafot of Sens|Tosafot of Sens]]. Samson's fellow pupil [[Judah Messer Leon (1166)|Judah b. Isaac of Paris]] (Sir Leon) was also very active; he wrote tosafot to several Talmudic treatises, of which those to Berakhot were published at Warsaw (1863); some of those to 'Abodah Zarah are extant in manuscript. Among the many French tosafists deserving special mention was [[Samuel ben Solomon of Falaise]] (Sir Morel), who, owing to the destruction of the Talmud in France in his time, relied for the text entirely upon his memory.<ref>[[Meir of Rothenburg]], Responsa, No. 250</ref>\n\nThe edited tosafot owe their existence particularly to Samson of Sens and to the following French tosafists of the thirteenth century: (1) [[Moses of \u00c9vreux]], (2) [[Eliezer of Touques]], and (3) [[Perez ben Elijah]] of Corbeil.\n\nIt has been said that the first German tosafist, Isaac b. Asher ha-Levi, was the head of a school, and that his pupils, besides composing tosafot of their own, revised his. In the thirteenth century the German schools were represented by [[Baruch ben Isaac]], in Regensburg, and later by [[Meir of Rothenburg]] (MaHaRaM); the Italian school was represented by [[Isaiah di Trani]]. If the tosafot of [[Asher b. Jehiel]] (RoSH) (d. 1328) are to be included, the tosafistic period extended through more than two centuries. When the fanaticism of the French monasteries and the bigotry of [[Louis IX]] brought about the destruction of the Talmud, the writing of tosafot in France soon ceased.\n\n===Overview===\nEach generation of Tosafists would add to the compiled glosses, and therefore there are many different versions of the ''Tosafot''. In addition, each compilation of the ''Tosafos'' did not contain everything that was said by the ''Tosafists'' on the subject so compilations will differ in what they say. Therefore, some things that were said by the ''Tosafists'' will be found only in obscure versions of the ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Publication===\nThe final version of these commentaries was published on the outer side of the pages of the Soncino edition of the Talmud, printed in [[Soncino, Lombardy|Soncino]], Italy (16th century), and was the first printed edition of the full Talmud. The publisher of that edition was a nephew of Rabbi Moshe of Spires (Shapiro) who was of the last generation of ''Tosafists'' and who initiated a project of writing a final compilation of the ''Tosafos''. Before he published his Talmud he traveled throughout France to the schools where the ''Tosafists'' learned and gathered all of the different manuscripts of that final version of the ''Tosafos'' and printed them in his Talmud. Since then every publication of the Talmud was printed with the ''Tosafos'' on the outer side of the page (the inner side has the commentary of Rashi) and is an integral part of the study of the Talmud.\n===The burning of the Talmud===\nDuring the period of the ''Tosafists'' the church enacted a law that prohibited possession of the Talmud under pain of death and [[Disputation of Paris#Outcome|24 wagon loads of scrolls of the Talmud were gathered from all of France and burned in the center of Paris]]. The intention of the church was that the study of the Talmud should be forgotten and once forgotten it would remain forgotten for all generations since there would be nobody to teach it. As a result, the ''Tosafists'' devised a system where they could study the Talmud without the existence of a text despite the vastness of the Talmud. They appointed scholars, each to be expert in one the volumes of the Talmud, to know it by heart and very well, and so through these scholars they would have expertise and knowledge in all of the Talmud. As they would study a particular text in one volume of the Talmud those scholars who were expert in different volumes of the Talmud would tell of anything in the volume of the Talmud that they were expert on that would contradict their understanding of the text at hand. Thus an important aspect of the scholarship of the ''Tosafists'' is to use texts in different areas of the Talmud to disprove certain interpretations of the Talmud (often those of Rashi) and to determine the correct way to understand the Talmud.\n\n==Authorities cited==\n\nThe Tosafot quote principally [[Rashi]] (very often under the designation \"\u1e33on\u1e6dres\" [= \"pamphlet\", Rashi initially published his commentary in pamphlets]), many of the ancient authorities (as [[Kalonymus of Lucca]], [[Nathan b. Jehiel]], and [[R. Hananeel]]), some contemporary scholars (as [[Abraham b. David of Posqui\u00e8res]], [[Maimonides]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], and others), and about 130 German and French Talmudists of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Many of the last-named are known as authors of general Talmudic works, as, for instance, [[Eliezer b. Nathan]] of Mainz, [[Judah of Corbeil]], and [[Jacob of Coucy]]; but many of them are known only through their being quoted in the Tosafot, as in the case of an [[Eliezer of Sens]], a [[Jacob of Orleans]], and many Abrahams and Isaacs. Some are mentioned just once, including Eliezer of \"Pelire\" [Falaise? Montpellier?]<ref>Tosafot Bava Batra 79b</ref>, Ephraim b. David<ref>Supposed contemporary of [[Judah Sir Leon]]; Tosafot 'Abodah Zarah 39a</ref>, and one Hezekiah<ref>Tosafot Bava Batra 44b</ref>. A commentary on the Pentateuch entitled \"Da'at Ze\u1e33enim\" (Leghorn, 1783) is attributed to the Tosafists. In form this commentary follows the style of the Tosafot; Rashi is often discussed, and sometimes corrected.\n\n==Schools of Tosafists==\n{{See also|List of Tosafists}}\n\n===Tosafot of Sens===\n\nThe earliest collection, compiled by [[Samson ben Abraham of Sens]].  It was one of the main sources for the [[#Tosafot of Touques|Tosafot of Touques]], which in turn underlies the present printed Tosafot (\"[[#The Edited Tosafot (called also Our Tosafot)|Tosafot shelanu]]\").  Passages from the Tosafot of Sens which did not find their way into the main collection are sometimes printed under the title of [[#Tosafot Yeshanim (\"Tosafot of the Ancients\")|Tosafot Yeshanim]].\n\n===Tosafot of \u00c9vreux===\n\n[[Moses of \u00c9vreux]], one of the most prolific tosafists, furnished glosses to the whole Talmud; they form a distinct group known as the Tosafot of [[\u00c9vreux]]. It may be presumed that the \"Tosafot of R. Moses\" mentioned by [[Mordechai ben Hillel]]<ref>\"Mordechai,\" on Sanhedrin, No. 937</ref> are identical with the tosafot just mentioned. According to [[Joseph Colon]]<ref>Responsa, No. 52</ref> and [[Elijah Mizra\u1e25i]],<ref>\"Mayim Amukim,\" 1:37</ref> Moses wrote his glosses on the margin of [[Isaac Alfasi]]'s \"Halakhot,\" probably at the time of the burning of the Talmud.\n\n===Tosafot of Touques===\n\n[[Eliezer of Touques]], of the second half of the thirteenth century, made a compendium of the Tosafot of Sens and of \u00c9vreux; this compendium is called the Tosafot of Touques, and forms the basis of the edited tosafot. Eliezer's own glosses, written on the margin, are known as the Tosafot Gillayon or Gilyon Tosafot. It must be premised, however, that the Tosafot of Touques did not remain untouched; they were revised afterward and supplemented by the glosses of later tosafists. Gershon Soncino, who printed these tosafot, declares that his ancestor Moses of F\u00fcrth, who lived in the middle of the fifteenth century, was a descendant in the fifth generation of Moses of Speyer, who is mentioned in the Tosafot of Touques. It is supposed that the last redactor of these tosafot was a pupil of Samson of Chinon.\n\n===Tosafot of Perez ben Elijah's Pupils===\n\n[[Perez ben Elijah]] of Corbeil was one of the most active of the later tosafists. Besides supplying tosafot to several treatises, which are quoted by many old authorities and are included among the edited tosafot (and many of which were seen in manuscript by Azulai), he revised those of his predecessors. His pupils were not less active; their additions are known as the Tosafot of Perez b. Elijah's Pupils.\n\n===Other bodies of tosafot===\n\n====French Tosafot====\nMentioned in the novellae on Tamid ascribed to [[Abraham b. David]]. Zunz<ref>\"Z.G.\" p.&nbsp;57</ref> thinks that the Tosafot of Sens may be referred to under this title; but the fact that Abraham b. David was much earlier than Samson of Sens leads to the supposition that the glosses indicated are those of previous tosafists, as Rabbeinu Tam, Isaac b. Asher ha-Levi, and Isaac b. Samuel ha-Za\u1e33en and his son.\n\n====Pis\u1e33e Tosafot (\"Decisions of the Tosafot\")====\nCollection of halakic decisions gathered from the edited tosafot to thirty-six treatises\u2014''Nazir'' and ''Me'ilah'' being excepted\u2014and generally printed in the margin of the Tosafot; in the later editions of the Talmud, after the text. These decisions number 5,931; of these 2,009 belong to the tractate''Berakot'' and the order ''Mo'ed''; 1,398 to ''Niddah'' and the order ''Nashim''; 1,503 to ''Nezi\u1e33in''; and 1,021 to ''\u1e32odashim''. The decisions contained in the tosafot to ''Shabbat'', ''Pesa\u1e25im'', ''Gi\u1e6d\u1e6din'', ''Ketubot'', ''Baba \u1e32amma'', ''Baba Me\u1e93i'a'', ''Baba Batra'', and ''\u1e24ullin'' number fully one-half of those recognized as authoritative. The compiler of these decisions can not be identified with certainty; [[Asher b. Jehiel]], his son [[Jacob b. Asher]], and Ezekiel, uncle of [[Eliezer of Touques]], are given by different authorities. [[Jacob Nordhausen]], also, is known to have compiled tosafot decisions; in fact, references to two groups of ''Pis\u1e33e Tosafot'' are found in the works of the later commentators.\n\n====Spanish Tosafot====\nThis term is used by [[Joseph Colon]]<ref>Responsa, No. 72</ref> and by [[Jacob Baruch Landau]]<ref>\"Agur,\" \u00a7 327</ref> and may apply to Talmudic novellae by Spanish authors. [[Jeshuah b. Joseph ha-Levi]], for instance, applies the term \"tosafot\" to the novellae of [[Isaac ben Sheshet]].<ref>\"Halikhot Olam,\" \u00a7 327</ref>\n\n====The Edited Tosafot (called also Our Tosafot)====\nThe tosafot which have been published with the text of the Talmud ever since its earliest edition (see [[Talmud#Printing|Talmud, Editions of]]). They extend to thirty-eight treatises of the Babylonian Talmud. Most of the treatises are covered by the Tosafot of Touques, some by the Tosafot of Sens; many are provided with the tosafot of various authors, revised by Perez b. Elijah's school. The authorship of the tosafot to seventeen treatises only can be established with certainty:\n* ''Berakot'': [[Moses of \u00c9vreux]];\n* ''Shabbat'', '' 'Erubin'', and ''Mena\u1e25ot'': the Tosafot of Sens;\n* ''Be\u1e93ah'', ''Nedarim'', ''Nazir'', ''Sanhedrin'', ''Makkot'', and ''Me'ilah'': [[Perez b. Elijah]]'s school (many written by Perez himself);\n* ''Yoma'': [[Me\u00efr of Rothenburg]];\n* ''Gi\u1e6d\u1e6din'', ''Baba \u1e32amma'', and ''\u1e24ullin'': the Tosafot of Touques;\n* ''So\u1e6dah'': [[Samuel of \u00c9vreux]];\n* '' 'Avodah Zarah'': [[Samuel of Falaise]];\n* ''Zeba\u1e25im'': [[Baruch b. Isaac of Worms]].\n\nThe tosafot to ''Mo'ed \u1e32a\u1e6don'' were written by a pupil of a certain R. Isaac; the author of the tosafot to ''\u1e24agigah'' wrote tosafot to other treatises also. Those to ''Ta'anit'' belong to the post-tosafot period, and differ in style from those to other treatises.\n\n====Tosafot Alfasi====\nQuoted by [[Joseph Colon]] (Responsa, Nos. 5, 31) and [[Judah Minz]] (Responsa, No. 10). The term may designate either the tosafot of [[Samuel b. Me\u00efr]] and [[Moses of \u00c9vreux]], or glosses to [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi]]'s ''Halakot''.\n\n====Tosafot of Gornish====\nMentioned by [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]]<ref>''Nobelot Chochmah,'' Preface</ref> and [[Solomon Algazi]],<ref>''Gufei Halakhot,'' No. 195</ref> the latter quoting these tosafot to [[Bava kamma]]. But as the same quotation is made by [[Betzalel Ashkenazi]]<ref>''Shitah Mekubetzet'' to Bava Kamma</ref> and ascribed to a pupil of [[Perez ben Elijah]], [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai|Azulai]]<ref>''Shem ha-Gedolim,'' ii.</ref> concludes that these tosafot originated in Perez b. Elijah's school. Still, [[Mordecai ben Hillel]]<ref>''Mordekhai,'' [[Bava Batra]], No. 886</ref> mentions a R. Judah of Gornish, and [[Abraham ibn Akra]]<ref>''Meharerei Nemerim,'' Venice, 1599</ref> reproduces Talmudic novellae by \"M. of Gornish\" (Embden gives \"Me\u00efr of Gornish\" in the Latin translation of the catalogue of the Oppenheim Library, No. 667). Manuscript No. 7 of the G\u00fcnzburg collection bears the superscription \"Tosafot of Gornish to Yebamot,\" and in these tosafot French and German rabbis are quoted. Manuscript No. 603 of the same collection contains also the Tosafot of Gornish and novellae by [[Judah Minz]], and fragments of Gornish tosafot are found in manuscripts in other libraries.\n\nDifferent theories have been advanced with regard to the name \"Gornish.\" According to [[S. Schechter]],<ref>''Jew. Chron.'' May 4, 1888</ref> it is a corruption of \"[[Mayence]]\", while H. Adler thinks it a corruption of  \"Norwich\".<ref>See [[A. Neubauer]] in ''R. E. J.'' xvii. 156, and [[Henri Gross]], ''Gallia Judaica,'' pp. 136 et seq.</ref> Gross (l.c.) thinks that Gornish may be identical with Gournay, in France, and that \"M. of Gornish,\" apparently the author of the Tosafot of Gornish, may be Moses of Gornish and identical with the Moses of \u05d2\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05e5 mentioned in the Tosafot of Sens (to [[Pesa\u1e25im]]). It may be added that in the supplement to [[Zacuto]]'s ''Yu\u1e25asin''<ref>p.&nbsp;164a, Cracow, 1581</ref> a David of \"Durnish\" occurs.\n\n====Tosafot \u1e24i\u1e93oniyyot (\"Exterior\" or \"Uncanonical Tosafot\")====\nTosafot which are neither of Sens nor of Touques. They are so called by [[Betzalel Ashkenazi]]; he included many fragments of them in his ''Shitah Mekubetzet'', to ''Bava Metzia'', ''Nazir'', etc.\n\n====Tosafot Shi\u1e6d\u1e6dah (or Shi\u1e6d\u1e6dah)====\nName sometimes applied to the recensions of [[Perez b. Elijah]] or to the tosafot of [[Jehiel of Paris]].<ref>Bezalel Ashkenazi, l.c.; notes to \"Sha'are Dura,\" \u00a7 57; and many other authorities</ref>\n\n====Tosafot Yeshanim (\"Tosafot of the Ancients\")====\nThis group comprises four smaller ones: (1) the general tosafot of Sens, including those appearing among the edited tosafot; (2) the earlier unedited tosafot (for example, those to \u1e32iddushin by Isaac b. Samuel haZaken of Dampierre, and those to Avodah Zarah by his son Elhanan b. Isaac); these sometimes appear separately under the title of '''Tosafot ha-Ri'''; (3) a collection of old tosafot published by Joseph Jessel b. Wolf ha-Levi in \"Sugyot ha-Shas\" (Berlin, 1736); (4) various tosafot found in ancient manuscripts, as the tosafot to Chullin written in 1360, the manuscript of which is in the Munich Library (No. 236). In the collection published by Joseph Jessel b. Wolf haLevi (No. 3), besides the old tosafot to Yoma by [[Moses of Coucy]],<ref>Compare, however, [[Israel Isserlein]], \"Terumat haDeshen,\" No. 94, who declares they belong to the Tosafot of Sens</ref> there are single tosafot to sixteen treatises\u2014Shabbat, Rosh HaShanah, Megillah, Gittin, Bava Metzia, Mena\u1e25ot, Bechorot, Eruvin, Beitzah, Ketubot, Kiddushin, Nazir, Bava Batra, Horayot, Keritot, and Niddah. In the [[Vilna Edition Shas|Vilna edition of the Talmud]] edited by [[Romm publishing house|Romm]], the \"old tosafot\" to several treatises are printed.\n\n====Tosafot ha-Rid====\n\nBy Rabbi [[Isaiah di Trani]].\n\n====Tosafot Hachmei Anglia====\n{{See also|Tosafot Hachmei Anglia}}\nA small collection of tosafot composed by rabbis from England.\n\n====Tosafot ha-Rosh====\n\nA commentary in tosafot style, and largely dependent on the earlier tosafot collections, composed by [[Asher ben Jehiel]].  These, together with the Hiddushim of [[Nahmanides]] and others, were studied by the [[Sephardi Jews]] instead of the normal Tosafot.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Tosafot collections===\nThe [[#The Edited Tosafot (called also Our Tosafot)|Tosafot shelanu]] are printed in most Talmud editions, in the column farther from the binding.  The Vilna edition also includes tosafot from other collections, such as Tosafot Yeshanim, Tosafot ha-Ri and Tosafot ha-Rid on a few tractates. The [[#Pis\u1e33e Tosafot (\"Decisions of the Tosafot\")|Piske Tosafot]] (decisions of the Tosafot) are printed at the end of each tractate.\n\nComplete sets of the [[#Tosafot ha-Rosh|Tosafot ha-Rosh]] and the [[#Tosafot of Perez ben Elijah's Pupils|Tosafot of Rabbi Peretz]] are published separately, as are individual volumes from the Tosafot Yeshanim and a few others.  The most recent editions of the Talmud, such as the Friedmann edition published by Oz we-Hadar, incorporate these collections at the back of each volume, in a synoptic fashion.

Initially, Indigenous Australians were in most states deprived of the rights of full citizenship of the new nation on grounds of their race and restrictive immigration laws were introduced to preference white European immigrants to Australia. Discriminatory laws against Indigenous people and multiethnic immigration were dismantled in the early decades of the Post War period. A [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 Referendum]] regarding Aboriginal rights was carried with over 90% approval by the electorate. Legal reforms from the 1970s won by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have re-established Aboriginal Land Rights under Australian law, 200 years after the arrival of the First Fleet. In the early 21st century, Indigenous Australians account for around 2.5% of the population, owning outright around 20% of all land - largely in the sparsely inhabited central Australian desert rather than the resource rich coastlines. Intense focus on the impact of historical policies like the [[Stolen Generation|removal of mixed ethnicity Aboriginal children]] from their Aboriginal parent resulted in a bipartisan Parliamentary apology to Aborigines carried in 2008. The apology was met with some controversy given the previous Prime Minister's, [[John Howard]], steadfast refusal to apologise on behalf of the Australian Government and by the non-participation of some conservative politicians including [[Peter Dutton]]. Aboriginal health indicators remain lower than other ethnic groups within Australia and again are the subject of political debate.\n\nPolicies of [[multiculturalism]] were pursued in the post-war period and first Eastern and Southern European, then Asian and African immigration increased significantly. Legislation including the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]], the Commonwealth [[Racial Hatred Act]] (1995) and the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act]] (1986) outlaw racial discrimination in the public sphere in Australia. In recent decades, anti-immigration political parties like the [[One Nation Party]] have received extensive media coverage, but only marginal electoral support and successive governments have maintained large, multiethnic programs of immigration.  As in other Western nations, tensions in the aftermath of events like the [[11 September attacks]] and [[2002 Bali bombings|Bali Bombing]] by radical Muslim extremists contributed to strained ethnic relations in some Australian communities. A notable outcome was the [[2005 Cronulla riots|2005 Cronulla race riot]] that saw thousands of Anglo-Saxon Australians target persons of Middle-Eastern appearance in south-eastern Sydney.\n\n==Indigenous Australians==\n[[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous peoples of Australia]], comprising [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]] peoples, have lived in Australia for at least 65,000+ years{{sfn|Davidson|Wahlquist|2017}}{{sfn|Wright|2017}} before the arrival of British settlers in 1788.

The ''[[Australian nationality law|Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948]]'', which came into force on 26 January 1949, created an Australian citizenship, but which co-existed with the continuing status of British subject. Aborigines became Australian citizens under the 1948 Act in the same way as other Australians (though Aborigines were not counted in the Australian population until after the [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]]). The same applied to Torres Strait Islanders and the indigenous population of the [[Territory of Papua]] (then a part of Australia).\n\nIn 1770 and again in 1788, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] claimed Eastern Australia as its own on the basis of the now discredited doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]''. The implication of the doctrine became evident when [[John Batman]] purported to make [[Batman's Treaty]] in 1835 with the [[Wurundjeri]] Elders of the area around the future [[Melbourne]].

Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown... Although many people at the time also recognised that the Aboriginal occupants had rights in the lands (and this was confirmed in a House of Commons report on Aboriginal relations in 1837), the law followed and almost always applied the principles expressed in Bourke's proclamation. This would not change until the Australian High Court's decision in the Mabo Case in 1992. | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080207041808/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=42 | archivedate = 7 February 2008}}</ref> Though the so-called Treaty was objectionable on many grounds, it was the first, and until the 1990s, the only time that an attempt was made to deal directly with the Indigenous peoples.\n\n===Historical relations===\nThe British navigator [[James Cook]] claimed the east coast of Australia for Britain in 1770, without conducting negotiations with the existing inhabitants. The first [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Arthur Phillip]], was expressly instructed to establish friendship and good relations with the Aborigines and interactions between the early settlers and the Indigenous people varied considerably throughout the colonial period \u2013 from the mutual curiosity displayed by the early interlocutors [[Bennelong]] and [[Bungaree]] of Sydney, to outright hostility of [[Pemulwuy]] and [[Windradyne]] of the Sydney region,<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 37</ref> and [[Yagan]] around Perth. Bennelong and a companion became the first Australians to sail to Europe, where they met [[King George III]]. Bungaree accompanied the explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] on the first circumnavigation of Australia. Pemulwuy was accused of the first killing of a white settler in 1790, and Windradyne resisted early British expansion beyond the Blue Mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/firstaustralians/index/index/epid/1 |title=First Australians |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref>\n\nWith the establishment of European settlement and its subsequent expansion, the Indigenous populations were progressively forced into neighbouring territories,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} or subsumed into the new political entities of the Australian colonies. Violent conflict between Indigenous peoples and European settlers, described by some historians as [[Australian frontier wars|frontier wars]], arose out of this expansion: by the late 19th century, many Indigenous populations had been forcibly relocated to land reserves and missions. The nature of many of these land reserves and missions enabled disease to spread quickly and many were closed as resident numbers dropped, with the remaining residents being moved to other land reserves and missions in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grey|first=Jeffrey|title=A Military History of Australia|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Port Melbourne|year=2008|edition=Third|isbn=978-0-521-69791-0|pages=28\u201340}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], in Australia during the colonial period: \"In a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings.

In the 1950s, the government pursued a policy of \"assimilation\" which sought to achieve full citizenship rights for Aborigines but also wanted them to adopt the mode of life of other Australians (which very often was assumed to require suppression of cultural identity).<ref>''The First Australians: A Fair Deal for a Dark Race'' par SBS TV 2008.</ref>\n\nIn 1962, [[Robert Menzies]]' ''Commonwealth Electoral Act'' provided that all Indigenous people should have the right to enrol and vote at federal elections (prior to this, indigenous people in Queensland, Western Australia and \"wards of the state\" in the Northern Territory had been excluded from voting unless they were ex-servicemen).

major component of the prostitution industry on the colonial frontiers in Australia such as parts of Queensland, northern and western Australia and the British Empire and Japanese Empire's growth were tied in with the karayuki-san, in the late 19th century Japan's impoverished farming islands provided the girls who became karayuki-san and were shipped to the Pacific and South-East Asia, the volcanic and mountainous terrain of Kyushu was bad for agriculture so parents sold their daughters, some of them seven years old to \"flesh traders\" (zegen) in the prefectures of Nagasaki and

Sydney's Chinese gambling which brought white European women to testify on 14 December 1891, such as 27-year-old Minnie, who had long term relationships with two Chinese men whom treated her kindly after she engaged in \"casual\" sexual relations with multiple Chinese men.{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=113}}\n\nMinnie ended up having sex with Chinese men after meeting them with friends who were also doing it, after she ran away from an abusive alcoholic husband when she was 16, seven other women were interviewed besides Minnie, girls and women escaped a dangerous street life by taking sanctuary in the inner city and The Rocks with the Chinese, another woman interviewed was Hannah who escaped her jailed brutal European husband to go live with a Chinese man, explaining that 'I thought it was better to have one man than be knocking about the streets with everybody', since the busband's 'people would not look after me', and Minnie said, 'I think fully half of them come to the Chinese when they have nowhere else to go', and she was asked 'Is it because the Chinese are kind to them?' she said 'That is the main thing, and for the sake of a home.'{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=114}}\n\nSome of the European husbands and partners of the women tried forcing them to work as prostitutes to 'knock about the streets' and take the money they earned or were physically violent towards the women, which led the women to go to the Chinese who provided them with houses, Pauline explained \"I would sooner live with a Chinaman than a white man. The Chinamen know how to treat a woman.' after her European husband tried to make her be a prostitute, a woman named Maud said 'he tries to please me, and I try to please him' and a woman named Adelaide loved and wanted to marry a young Chinese man but his father forced him to break off the relationship, another two women interviewed were Ellen A and Ellen B.{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=115}}\n\nSome of these women still engaged in prostitution with multiple other Chinese men even after they formed a relationship with a single Chinese man, these women were proud of being wives of the Chinese and their well maintained houses, saying they were 'clean and tidy' and the commissioners even said they were 'clean and even tastefully furnished', and Ellen B said 'You always see all the Chinese women's houses clean and comfortable', 'always plenty to eat and drink' and Minnie said she was 'living respectably with a Chinaman', the women also viewed non-white men of different races in a different light, saying that the 'dark' men like Lascars were different from the Chinese and Ellen B said 'there is not a girl with the Chinese that cares about a dark fellow.'{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=116}}\n\nThe commission admitted that 'they have some reason to be satisfied, as they say they are, with their surroundings. The probability is that they would be on the streets of Sydney if they were not the mistresses of industrious Chinamen.' and admitted that without the opium problem that 'it would be impossible to say that these, among the most unfortunate class of women in our midst, had not improved their surroundings by crossing the racial line' and 'there is not ground for suspicion that our alien population is now a danger to youthful virtue.' so the commission only ended up advocating tougher anti-opium measures, the women also rejected the claim by Inspector Richard Seymour in 1875 that opium rendered girls unconscious and vulnerable to sexual activity, making it clear that opium smokers were conscious during the smoking.{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=119}} During an Inquiry in 1875 it was reported by the police that the Chinese were being serviced by young girls.{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=120}}\n\nA European man originally impregnated Ellen B in Melbourne and she then moved to Beechworth, Albury, and finally Sydney after she gave birth, arriving at an Anglican church run \"Church Home\" which was for \"fallen women\" where a woman there introduced her to the Chinese.{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=121}}\n\nChinese men in The Rocks were sexually serviced by 40-50 European women, these women were not 'mistresses' who lived with a single Chinese man like the women interviewed by the commission but they were full-time prostitutes.{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=122}} The commission admitted that 'The European women who lived as prostitutes amongst the Chinese appear, in nearly every case, to have fled to their present haunts as to refuges from the brutality of men of their own race. They had lost caste; they had taken to drink; they were the drudges of larrikins who ill-treated them; some had been in gaol; none were enjoying the protection of decent homes. So, far the lack of better prospects, they sought the Chinamen, who at least pay them well and treat them kindly.' and these prostitutes were found in Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales in the countryside amongst the Chinese settlements.{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=123}} A lot of the prostitutes were Irish Catholic girls and women in colonial Australia.{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=127}}\n\nIn late 1878, there were 181 marriages between women of European descent and Chinese men as well as 171 such couples cohabiting without matrimony, resulting in the birth of 586 children of Sino-European descent.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DqgezQo551kC&pg=PA351&lpg=PA351&dq=181+marriages+between+European+women+and+Chinese+men,+and+171+couples+cohabiting+without+matrimony,+resulting+in+586+Eurasian+children. |title=Religion and Retributive Logic |isbn=978-9004178809 |last1=Cusack |first1=Carole M. |last2=Hartney |first2=Christopher |year=2010 }}</ref> Such a rate of intermarriage between Chinese Australians and white Australians was to continue until the 1930s.\n\nThe '''Buckland riot''' was an anti-Chinese [[race riot]] that occurred on 4 July 1857, in the goldfields of the [[Buckland River (Victoria)|Buckland Valley]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]], near present-day [[Porepunkah]].

Some of the sources of conflict between European and Chinese miners arose from the nature of the industry they were engaged in. Most [[gold mining]] in the early years was [[alluvial]] mining, where the gold was in small particles mixed with dirt, gravel and clay close to the surface of the ground, or buried in the beds of old watercourses or \"leads\". Extracting the gold took no great skill, but it was hard work, and generally speaking, the more work, the more gold the miner won. Europeans tended to work alone or in small groups, concentrating on rich patches of ground, and frequently abandoning a reasonably rich claim to take up another one rumoured to be richer. Very few miners became wealthy; the reality of the diggings was that relatively few miners found even enough gold to earn them a living.\n\n===White Australia policy===\n{{main|White Australia policy}}\nFollowing the establishment of autonomous parliaments, a rise in nationalism and improvements in transportation, the Australian colonies voted to unite in a Federation, which came into being in 1901. The [[Australian Constitution]] and early parliaments established one of the most progressive governmental systems on the earth at that time, with male and female suffrage and series of checks and balances built into the governmental framework. National security fears had been one of the chief motivators for the union and legislation was quickly enacted to restrict non-European immigration to Australia - the foundation of the White Australia policy - and voting rights for Aborigines were denied across most states.\n\nAustralia's official World War One historian [[Charles Bean]] defined the early intentions of the policy as \"a vehement effort to maintain a high Western standard of economy, society and culture (necessitating at that stage, however it might be camouflaged, the rigid exclusion of Oriental people).\"<ref name=\"Bean\">{{cite book |last1=Bean |first1=C.

W. |title=Anzac to Amiens |p=5 |date=26 March 2014 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780143571674}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Barton Government|new Parliament]] quickly moved to restrict immigration to maintain Australia's \"British character\", and the Pacific Island Labourers Bill and the Immigration Restriction Bill were passed shortly before parliament rose for its first Christmas recess. Nevertheless, the Colonial Secretary in Britain made it clear that a race based immigration policy would run \"contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have ever been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire\", so the [[Barton Government]] conceived of the \"language dictation test\", which would allow the government, at the discretion of the minister, to block unwanted migrants by forcing them to sit a test in \"any European language\". Race had already been established as a premise for exclusion among the colonial parliaments, so the main question for debate was who exactly the new Commonwealth ought to exclude, with the Labor Party rejecting Britain's calls to placate the populations of its non-white colonies and allow \"aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands thereof\". There was opposition from Queensland and its sugar industry to the proposals of the Pacific Islanders Bill to exclude \"Kanaka\" laborers, however Barton argued that the practice was \"veiled slavery\" that could lead to a \"negro problem\" similar to that in the United States and the Bill was passed.<ref>Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978</ref>\n\n====Demise of the White Australia policy====\nThe restrictive measures established by the first parliament gave way to multi-ethnic immigration policies only after the [[Second World War]], with the \"dictation test\" itself being finally abolished in 1958 by the [[Menzies Government (1949\u20131966)|Menzies Government]].<ref name=\"immi.gov.au\"/>\n\nThe Menzies Government instigated migrants over all others since the time of Australian Federation in 1901 and abolished restrictions on voting rights for Aborigines, which had persisted in some jurisdictions. In 1950 External Affairs Minister [[Percy Spender]] instigated the [[Colombo Plan]], under which students from Asian countries were admitted to study at Australian universities, then in 1957 non-Europeans with 15 years' residence in Australia were allowed to become citizens. In a watershed legal reform, a 1958 revision of the Migration Act introduced a simpler system for entry and abolished the \"dictation test\" which had permitted the exclusion of migrants on the basis of their ability to take down a dictation offered in ''any'' European language. Immigration Minister, Sir Alexander Downer, announced that 'distinguished and highly qualified Asians' might immigrate. Restrictions continued to be relaxed through the 1960s in the lead up to the [[Holt Government]]'s watershed ''Migration Act, 1966''.<ref name=\"immi.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/08abolition.htm|title=Fact Sheet 8 \u2013 Abolition of the 'White Australia' Policy|publisher=Immi.gov.au|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nHolt's government introduced the ''Migration Act 1966'', which effectively dismantled the [[White Australia policy]] and increased access to non-European migrants, including refugees fleeing the [[Vietnam War]]. Holt also called the 1967 Referendum which removed the discriminatory clause in the [[Australian Constitution]] which excluded [[Aboriginal Australians]] from being counted in the census;\u2013 the referendum was one of the few to be overwhelmingly endorsed by the Australian electorate (over 90% voted 'yes').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in-office.aspx|title=In office|publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe legal end of the White Australia Policy is usually placed in 1973, when the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam Labor government]] implemented a series of amendments preventing the enforcement of racial aspects of the immigration law.

Initially, Indigenous Australians were in most states deprived of the rights of full citizenship of the new nation on grounds of their race and restrictive immigration laws were introduced to preference white European immigrants to Australia. Discriminatory laws against Indigenous people and multiethnic immigration were dismantled in the early decades of the Post War period. A [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 Referendum]] regarding Aboriginal rights was carried with over 90% approval by the electorate. Legal reforms from the 1970s won by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have re-established Aboriginal Land Rights under Australian law, 200 years after the arrival of the First Fleet. In the early 21st century, Indigenous Australians account for around 2.5% of the population, owning outright around 20% of all land - largely in the sparsely inhabited central Australian desert rather than the resource rich coastlines. Intense focus on the impact of historical policies like the [[Stolen Generation|removal of mixed ethnicity Aboriginal children]] from their Aboriginal parent resulted in a bipartisan Parliamentary apology to Aborigines carried in 2008. The apology was met with some controversy given the previous Prime Minister's, [[John Howard]], steadfast refusal to apologise on behalf of the Australian Government and by the non-participation of some conservative politicians including [[Peter Dutton]]. Aboriginal health indicators remain lower than other ethnic groups within Australia and again are the subject of political debate.\n\nPolicies of [[multiculturalism]] were pursued in the post-war period and first Eastern and Southern European, then Asian and African immigration increased significantly. Legislation including the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]], the Commonwealth [[Racial Hatred Act]] (1995) and the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act]] (1986) outlaw racial discrimination in the public sphere in Australia. In recent decades, anti-immigration political parties like the [[One Nation Party]] have received extensive media coverage, but only marginal electoral support and successive governments have maintained large, multiethnic programs of immigration.  As in other Western nations, tensions in the aftermath of events like the [[11 September attacks]] and [[2002 Bali bombings|Bali Bombing]] by radical Muslim extremists contributed to strained ethnic relations in some Australian communities. A notable outcome was the [[2005 Cronulla riots|2005 Cronulla race riot]] that saw thousands of Anglo-Saxon Australians target persons of Middle-Eastern appearance in south-eastern Sydney.\n\n==Indigenous Australians==\n[[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous peoples of Australia]], comprising [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]] peoples, have lived in Australia for at least 65,000+ years{{sfn|Davidson|Wahlquist|2017}}{{sfn|Wright|2017}} before the arrival of British settlers in 1788.

The ''[[Australian nationality law|Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948]]'', which came into force on 26 January 1949, created an Australian citizenship, but which co-existed with the continuing status of British subject. Aborigines became Australian citizens under the 1948 Act in the same way as other Australians (though Aborigines were not counted in the Australian population until after the [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]]). The same applied to Torres Strait Islanders and the indigenous population of the [[Territory of Papua]] (then a part of Australia).\n\nIn 1770 and again in 1788, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] claimed Eastern Australia as its own on the basis of the now discredited doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]''. The implication of the doctrine became evident when [[John Batman]] purported to make [[Batman's Treaty]] in 1835 with the [[Wurundjeri]] Elders of the area around the future [[Melbourne]]. [[Richard Bourke|Governor Bourke]] of [[New South Wales]] proclaimed the Treaty null and void and that [[indigenous Australians]] could not sell or assign land, nor could an individual person or group acquire it, other than through distribution by the [[Crown land|Crown]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=42 | title = Governor Bourke's Proclamation 1835 (UK) | work = Documenting a Democracy: 110 key documents that are the foundation of our nation | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2008-03-05 | quote = This document implemented the doctrine of ''terra nullius'' upon which British settlement was based, reinforcing the notion that the land belonged to no nation prior the British Crown taking possession of it. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown... Although many people at the time also recognised that the Aboriginal occupants had rights in the lands (and this was confirmed in a House of Commons report on Aboriginal relations in 1837), the law followed and almost always applied the principles expressed in Bourke's proclamation.

The first [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Arthur Phillip]], was expressly instructed to establish friendship and good relations with the Aborigines and interactions between the early settlers and the Indigenous people varied considerably throughout the colonial period \u2013 from the mutual curiosity displayed by the early interlocutors [[Bennelong]] and [[Bungaree]] of Sydney, to outright hostility of [[Pemulwuy]] and [[Windradyne]] of the Sydney region,<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 37</ref> and [[Yagan]] around Perth.

to have one man than be knocking about the streets with everybody', since the busband's 'people would not look after me', and Minnie said, 'I think fully half of them come to the Chinese when they

The Chinamen know how to treat a woman.' after her European husband tried to make her be a prostitute, a woman named Maud said 'he tries to please me, and I try to please him' and a woman named Adelaide loved and wanted to marry a young Chinese man but his father forced him to break off the relationship, another two women interviewed were Ellen A and Ellen B.{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=115}}\n\nSome of these women still engaged in prostitution with multiple other Chinese men even after they formed a relationship with a single Chinese man, these women were proud of being wives of the Chinese and their well maintained houses, saying they were 'clean and tidy' and the commissioners even said they were 'clean and even tastefully furnished', and Ellen B said 'You always see all the Chinese women's houses clean and comfortable', 'always plenty to eat and drink' and Minnie said she was 'living respectably with a Chinaman', the women also viewed non-white men of different races in a different light, saying that the 'dark' men like Lascars were different from the Chinese and Ellen B said 'there is not a girl with the Chinese that cares about a dark fellow.'{{sfn|Frances|2007|p=116}}\n\nThe commission admitted that 'they have some reason to be satisfied, as they say they are, with their surroundings.

Some of the sources of conflict between European and Chinese miners arose from the nature of the industry they were engaged in. Most [[gold mining]] in the early years was [[alluvial]] mining, where the gold was in small particles mixed with dirt, gravel and clay close to the surface of the ground, or buried in the beds of old watercourses or \"leads\". Extracting the gold took no great skill, but it was hard work, and generally speaking, the more work, the more gold the miner won. Europeans tended to work alone or in small groups, concentrating on rich patches of ground, and frequently abandoning a reasonably rich claim to take up another one rumoured to be richer. Very few miners became wealthy; the reality of the diggings was that relatively few miners found even enough gold to earn them a living.\n\n===White Australia policy===\n{{main|White Australia policy}}\nFollowing the establishment of autonomous parliaments, a rise in nationalism and improvements in transportation, the Australian colonies voted to unite in a Federation, which came into being in 1901. The [[Australian Constitution]] and early parliaments established one of the most progressive governmental systems on the earth at that time, with male and female suffrage and series of checks and balances built into the governmental framework. National security fears had been one of the chief motivators for the union and legislation was quickly enacted to restrict non-European immigration to Australia - the foundation of the White Australia policy - and voting rights for Aborigines were denied across most states.\n\nAustralia's official World War One historian [[Charles Bean]] defined the early intentions of the policy as \"a vehement effort to maintain a high Western standard of economy, society and culture (necessitating at that stage, however it might be camouflaged, the rigid exclusion of Oriental people).\"<ref name=\"Bean\">{{cite book |last1=Bean |first1=C. E. W. |title=Anzac to Amiens |p=5 |date=26 March 2014 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780143571674}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Barton Government|new Parliament]] quickly moved to restrict immigration to maintain Australia's \"British character\", and the Pacific Island Labourers Bill and the Immigration Restriction Bill were passed shortly before parliament rose for its first Christmas recess. Nevertheless, the Colonial Secretary in Britain made it clear that a race based immigration policy would run \"contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have ever been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire\", so the [[Barton Government]] conceived of the \"language dictation test\", which would allow the government, at the discretion of the minister, to block unwanted migrants by forcing them to sit a test in \"any European language\". Race had already been established as a premise for exclusion among the colonial parliaments, so the main question for debate was who exactly the new Commonwealth ought to exclude, with the Labor Party rejecting Britain's calls to placate the populations of its non-white colonies and allow \"aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands thereof\". There was opposition from Queensland and its sugar industry to the proposals of the Pacific Islanders Bill to exclude \"Kanaka\" laborers, however Barton argued that the practice was \"veiled slavery\" that could lead to a \"negro problem\" similar to that in the United States and the Bill was passed.<ref>Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978</ref>\n\n====Demise of the White Australia policy====\nThe restrictive measures established by the first parliament gave way to multi-ethnic immigration policies only after the [[Second World War]], with the \"dictation test\" itself being finally abolished in 1958 by the [[Menzies Government (1949\u20131966)|Menzies Government]].<ref name=\"immi.gov.au\"/>\n\nThe Menzies Government instigated migrants over all others since the time of Australian Federation in 1901 and abolished restrictions on voting rights for Aborigines, which had persisted in some jurisdictions. In 1950 External Affairs Minister [[Percy Spender]] instigated the [[Colombo Plan]], under which students from Asian countries were admitted to study at Australian universities, then in 1957 non-Europeans with 15 years' residence in Australia were allowed to become citizens. In a watershed legal reform, a 1958 revision of the Migration Act introduced a simpler system for entry and abolished the \"dictation test\" which had permitted the exclusion of migrants on the basis of their ability to take down a dictation offered in ''any'' European language. Immigration Minister, Sir Alexander Downer, announced that 'distinguished and highly qualified Asians' might immigrate. Restrictions continued to be relaxed through the 1960s in the lead up to the [[Holt Government]]'s watershed ''Migration Act, 1966''.<ref name=\"immi.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/08abolition.htm|title=Fact Sheet 8 \u2013 Abolition of the 'White Australia' Policy|publisher=Immi.gov.au|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nHolt's government introduced the ''Migration Act 1966'', which effectively dismantled the [[White Australia policy]] and increased access to non-European migrants, including refugees fleeing the [[Vietnam War]]. Holt also called the 1967 Referendum which removed the discriminatory clause in the [[Australian Constitution]] which excluded [[Aboriginal Australians]] from being counted in the census;\u2013 the referendum was one of the few to be overwhelmingly endorsed by the Australian electorate (over 90% voted 'yes').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in-office.aspx|title=In office|publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe legal end of the White Australia Policy is usually placed in 1973, when the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam Labor government]] implemented a series of amendments preventing the enforcement of racial aspects of the immigration law.

The report found however that the proficiency of Indians in the English language and their consequent higher engagement in employment in the services sector (\"including service stations, convenience stores, taxi drivers and other employment that typically involves working late night shifts alone and come with an increased risk of crime, either at the workplace or while travelling to and from work\") was a more likely explanation for the crime rate differential than was any \"racial motivation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/special/1-20/001/04_executive.aspx|title=Australian Institute of Criminology - Executive summary|publisher=Aic.gov.au|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 May 2009, Indian students protested against what they claimed were racist attacks, blocking streets in central [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]].
