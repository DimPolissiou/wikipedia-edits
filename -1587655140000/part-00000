American sociologist [[Charles Cooley|C.H. Cooley]] classifies social groups on the basis of contact in primary groups. In his paper ''Social Organization (1909),'' he describes primary groups (family, playgroups, neighborhoods, community of elders) as \"those characterized by intimate face-to-face association and cooperation.\"<ref>Cooley, C. H. (1909). Social organization: A study of the larger mind. Charles Scribner's Sons.</ref> Although there are other types of classifications by other sociologists, Cooley's classification and description is more applicable to the concept of traditional transmission. The idea of intimate interactions aligns with how the language is transmitted from the parents to their next generation on a fundamental level.\n\nConsequently, following this line of thought, social groups play an integral role in the transmission of language from one generation to the next. In support of this notion, the importance of social groups in traditional transmission is illustrated in the presence of [[social isolation]] and children end up with an inability to effectively acquire a language. These children were thus commonly then known as a\"[[feral child]]/wild child\".  The following examples showcase a few classic case studies of rescued \"wild\" children who have gone through [[language deprivation]] and forms credible support for the argument of traditional transmission.\n\nSome commonly known examples include:\n\n1) [[Anna (feral child)|Anna]] - (born in 1932)\n\nAnna from Pennsylvania, was raised in private due to illegitimacy. \nKept hidden and trapped in an attic, malnourished and unable to move, till she was rescued at six years old. This resulted in her lack of language ability. Once rescued, Anna received linguistic input and showed aptitude for understanding instructions but ultimately never acquired speaking.\n\n2) [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]] - (born in 1957)\n\nGenie remains one of the most prominent examples of linguistically isolated children ever studied. Only rescued at 13 years of age, Genie was inadequately exposed to language input and demonstrated no language ability upon rescue. Yet with linguistic input that came from her social circles then, Genie gradually acquired communication, albeit neither fluent nor smooth.\n\n3) [[Victor of Aveyron]] - (born in 1788)\n\nVictor was one of the earliest feral children studied. Rescued at 12, he ran away from civilisation eight times and his case was eventually undertaken by a young medical student who tried to train him to communicate. Victor showed impressive progress with reading and comprehension of simple words. However, he never progressed beyond a rudimentary level.\n\n== Significance ==\nAn important thought for consideration when it comes to traditional transmission and why it is a significant milestone in [[language acquisition]] is its influence on language learning patterns. Traditional transmission denotes naturally that learning is acquired through social interactions and built upon by teaching and enforcement. This hence influences research when it comes to language learning patterns, impacting our understanding of the human cognition as well as language structure. Compellingly, it also determines the direction of how language should be taught and passed down. From the standpoint of traditional transmission where language manifests as a socially learned, culturally transmitted system, language acquisition is mechanical and is directly affected by the present environment the individual is placed in. This removes the premise of language acquisition from that of being a biological construct and instead of having to biologically explain traditional transmission, it introduces the possibility that the design features of language itself stem from traditional transmission. Of course, for the above to be significant, it therefore means that languages engage in cultural selection for learnability where an assumption of innateness is inconsequential and languages adapt over time due to a need for survival.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kenny|last2=Kirby|first2=Simon|date=2008-11-12|title=Cultural evolution: implications for understanding the human language faculty and its evolution|url=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2008.0145|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=363|issue=1509|pages=3591\u20133603|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0145|issn=0962-8436|pmc=2607345|pmid=18801718}}</ref> The above plays a major role in the study of languages, especially in their properties, structure and how it developed with time or throughout human history to be the system it is today; providing valuable insights into language and the human race, language and the human cognition as well as language and its path to survival.\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe main argument to the validity of traditional transmission has always been one of social versus biological construct. The concept of language being taught and learnt socially rather than being an innate instinct has been a minefield of debate for years. Specifically, the idea of language being taught extra-genetically has been met with countless criticism. These criticisms mostly stem from the proponents of the American linguist, [[Noam Chomsky]] and his school of thought. Chomsky was a supporter of [[generative grammar]]. He and his followers believed that humans possess the innate ability for the learning and acquisition of languages. This theory assumes an inborn capacity for language where language learning takes place from a place of priming. As such, Chomsky's view is that humans invariably have a certain language input at birth and therefore language learning after happens as enforcement based on the already present structure of grammar in the individual. Chomsky also introduced the concept of [[linguistic competence]] as \"the system of linguistic knowledge possessed by [[native speaker]]s of a [[language]]\", to further support the idea of generative grammar. Linguistic competence as opposed to linguistic performance (what is actually uttered) is rather about the mental states, thought processes and representations related to language.

The main distinction between performance and competence is the variable of [[Speech error|speech errors]] where in one might have full competence of language yet still succumb to speech errors in performance because competence and performance are fundamentally two different aspects of language. Related to generative grammar, Chomsky also proposed the idea of a \"[[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]\" where he postulates that a specific set of structural rules of language are universal for all human languages which is also a very much controversial topic discussed widely, one of them being the prominent paper by Evans and Levinson (2009).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Nicholas|last2=Levinson|first2=Stephen C.|date=October 2009|title=The myth of language universals: Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0140525X0999094X/type/journal_article|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|language=en|volume=32|issue=5|pages=429\u2013448|doi=10.1017/S0140525X0999094X|issn=0140-525X|doi-access=free}}</ref> All in all, Chomsky's ideas and theories have served as the main opposing view to Hockett's design features, remaining highly controversial and a dominant area of research in the linguistics field of studies even till today. \n\n== Criticism ==\nIn the domain of evolutionary linguistics, Wacewicz & \u017bywiczy\u0144ski have argued on the whole against Hockett's design features and why his perspective is largely incompatible to modern language evolution research.

One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.

Slater was mentioned as playing the best game, with many gains down the left side of the field, as that was Illinois' weak spot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/349848516/?terms=Chicago+Athletic+Association+football|title=13 Oct 1895, 6 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n[[Duquesne Country and Athletic Club]] (DCAC) would also release their schedule for the 1895 football season, which included a game with Chicago AA on November 9th.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/34194128/?terms=Chicago+Athletic+Association+football|title=13 Oct 1895, Page 11 - The Inter Ocean at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n'''October 16th-''' The match against Lake Forest was postponed to October 22nd.  In the meantime, the CAA arranged a game with the Indianapolis Light Artillery, who were seeking a match to start off their 1895 season.

This was one of the first games played in Indianapolis in 1895, as the city had \"opened\" the football season on the same day.  The Indianapolis Journal described the CAA team as a machine, and gave credit to Brown, Slater, Camp, Hadden and Coffeen for good runs.  Thompson made the first touchdown, followed by Brown, and then Camp, with Brown going 2 for 3 on PATs.  The ILA team had some minor disagreements with the referring, but overall claimed the CAA had great teamwork, and was well trained in interference (blocking and tackling).  <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322142438/?terms=Chicago+Athletic+Association+football|title=20 Oct 1895, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/34194514/?terms=Chicago+Athletic+Association+football|title=20 Oct 1895, Page 10 - The Inter Ocean at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/349849313/?terms=Chicago+Athletic+Association+football|title=20 Oct 1895, 6 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n'''October 22nd-''' Mr. Mulliken, a man with past experience at Columbia and on the Crescent Athletic Club of Brooklyn, decides to join the Chicago AA eleven. CAA also began preparation for their journey to the east, and sent out the first roster of those going.  The initial list was, Stone and Thompson as Left Ends, Thomas Left Tackle, Ryan Left Guard, Stevenson Center, Bartl and Mulliken Right Guards, McCormick Right Tackle, Hadden Right End, Aldrich Quarterback, Coffeen, Blaney and Hoagland Right Half Backs, Slater Left Half Back, and Brown Full Back.  Camp would not attend the trip East due to ill health.  Another important event to note is the football teams of Rush Medical College and Lake Forest combining for the remainder of the 1895 season.  Rush would bolster the Lake Forest ranks, while also attempting Lake Forest's reportedly impossible schedule of [[1895 Northwestern Purple football team|Northwestern]], [[1895 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], who at the time had a combined record of 9-3, with Michigan undefeated.  Lake Forest had also just come from contests between the likes of [[1895 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] and [[1895 Chicago Maroons football team|Chicago]], who had beaten them 52 to 0 and 26 to 5 respectively.  They had even lost to the minor team Amour, 6 to 0, and so when a merger was proposed between them and Rush, the agreement was made.  The two teams hoped to stand a better chance against the CAA as well when they play them this afternoon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/349849690/?terms=Chicago+Athletic+Association+football|title=22 Oct 1895, 7 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===October 22nd- CAA vs Rush-Lake Forest===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=CAA vs Rush-Lake Forest\n|Visitor= Rush-lake Forest\n|Host= CAA\n|V1=0|V2=0\n|H1=18|H2=12\n|Date=October 22, 1895\n|Location= CAA Field, Chicago, IL\n|TimeZone=CT\n|StartTime= \n|ElapsedTime= 40 minutes (1st half 25 minutes, 2nd half 15 minutes)\n|Attendance= \n|Weather=\n|Referee= Hoagland\n|Umpire= Sager\n|Injured=\n|Linesmen= \n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nThe contest was yet another blowout for the semi-professionals, as Rush-Lake Forest suffered from injury, and CAA's FB Brown had a perfect 5 for 5 PAT streak, culminating in a 30 to 0 shellacking of the makeshift college team.  Thomas scores the first Touchdown, followed by Blaney twice to end the first half.  Blaney attained another touchdown at the beginning of the next half, with Thomas also scoring the last touchdown, and Brown rounding out the score to 30 with his impeccable kicking.  Although the score is large, one writer for The Inter Ocean newspaper claimed that CAA played horribly.  He asserted that \"if yesterday's showing is a test of the ability at the game, it [The Chicago AA team] would have to work hard to defeat the Yohokas Pigskin Pelters or any like organization.\"  In other news, the CAA would hold a practice with the Illinois Cycling Club this afternoon, the last practice before their trip east on October 24th at 10:30 A.

One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

DC purchased many of their competitors' comic stables, including [[Fawcett Comics]], whose Beck-created Captain Marvel was central to a lawsuit with DC.]]\n\nThe company began to move aggressively against what it saw as [[copyright infringement|copyright-violating]] imitations from other companies, such as [[Fox Comics]]' [[Wonder Man (Fox Publications)|Wonder Man]], which (according to court testimony) Fox started as a copy of Superman. This extended to DC suing [[Fawcett Comics]] over [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], at the time comics' top-selling character (see ''[[National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.]]''). Faced with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy if it lost, Fawcett capitulated in 1953 and ceased publishing comics. Years later, Fawcett sold the rights for Captain Marvel to DC\u2014which in 1972 revived Captain Marvel in the new title ''Shazam!'' featuring artwork by his creator, [[C. C. Beck]]. In the meantime, the abandoned trademark had been seized by [[Marvel Comics]] in 1967, with the creation of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|their Captain Marvel]], forbidding the DC comic itself to be called that. While Captain Marvel did not recapture his old popularity, he later appeared in a Saturday morning [[Shazam! (TV series)|live action TV adaptation]] and gained a prominent place in the mainstream continuity DC calls the [[DC Universe]].\n\nWhen the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s, the company focused on such genres as science fiction, [[Western comics|Westerns]], [[humour|humor]], and [[Romance comics|romance]]. DC also published [[Crime comics|crime]] and [[Horror comics|horror]] titles, but relatively tame ones, and thus avoided the mid-1950s backlash against such comics. A handful of the most popular superhero-titles, including ''Action Comics'' and ''Detective Comics'', the medium's two longest-running titles, continued publication.\n\n===Silver Age===\n{{Main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}\n\nIn the mid-1950s, editorial director [[Irwin Donenfeld]] and publisher Liebowitz directed editor [[Julius Schwartz]] (whose roots lay in the science-fiction book market) to produce a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] story in the try-out title ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''. Instead of reviving the old character, Schwartz had writers [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]], [[penciller|penciler]] [[Carmine Infantino]], and [[inker]] [[Joe Kubert]] create an entirely new super-speedster, updating and modernizing the Flash's civilian identity, costume, and origin with a science-fiction bent. The Flash's reimagining in ''Showcase'' No. 4 (October 1956) proved sufficiently popular that it soon led to a similar revamping of the [[Green Lantern]] character, the introduction of the modern all-star team [[Justice League of America]] (JLA), and many more superheroes, heralding what historians and fans call the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].\n\nNational did not reimagine its continuing characters (primarily Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman), but radically overhauled them. The Superman family of titles, under editor [[Mort Weisinger]], introduced such enduring characters as [[Supergirl]], [[Bizarro]], and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The Batman titles, under editor Jack Schiff, introduced the successful [[Batwoman]], [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl]], [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]] in an attempt to modernize the strip with non-science-fiction elements. Schwartz, together with artist Infantino, then revitalized Batman in what the company promoted as the \"New Look\", re-emphasizing Batman as a detective. Meanwhile, editor Kanigher successfully introduced a whole family of Wonder Woman characters having fantastic adventures in a mythological context.\n\nSince the 1940s, when Superman, Batman, and many of the company's other heroes began appearing in stories together, DC's characters inhabited a shared [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that, decades later, was dubbed the \"[[DC Universe]]\" by fans. With the story \"[[Flash of Two Worlds]]\", in ''Flash'' No. 123 (September 1961), editor Schwartz (with writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artists Infantino and [[Joe Giella]]) introduced a concept that allowed slotting the 1930s and 1940s [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] heroes into this continuity via the explanation that they lived on an other-dimensional \"Earth 2\", as opposed to the modern heroes' \"Earth 1\"\u2014in the process creating the foundation for what was later called the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]].\n\nDC's introduction of the reimagined superheroes did not go unnoticed by other comics companies. In 1961, with DC's JLA as the specific spur,{{refn|Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, either [[Jack Liebowitz]] or [[Irwin Donenfeld]] of DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications)<!--also known as name is mentioned here because Stan Lee says \"National Comics\" in quote directly below this paragraph--> bragged about DC's success with the Justice League (which had debuted in ''The Brave and the Bold'' No. 28 [February 1960] before going on to its own title) to publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] (whose holdings included the nascent [[Marvel Comics]], which was being distributed by DC's Independent News at this time.) during a game of golf.\n<br /><br />\nHowever, film producer and comics historian [[Michael Uslan]] partly debunked the story in a letter published in ''Alter Ego'' No. 43 (December 2004), pp. 43\u201344\n{{quote|Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue.

According to Lee in ''Origins of Marvel Comics'' ([[Marvel Fireside Books|Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books]], 1974), p. 16:\n\"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most.

That commercial situation especially applied with Marvel's superior [[sell-through]] percentage numbers which were typically 70% to DC's roughly 50%, which meant DC's publications were barely making a profit in comparison after returns from the distributors were calculated while Marvel was making an excellent profit by comparison.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Reed |title=Slugfest: In the Epic 50-Year Battle between Marvel and DC |date=2017 |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=xiii }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the senior DC staff were reportedly at a loss at this time to understand how this small publishing house was achieving this increasingly threatening commercial strength. For instance, when Marvel's product was examined in a meeting, Marvel's emphasis on more sophisticated character-based narrative and artist-driven visual storytelling was apparently ignored for self-deluding guesses at the brand's popularity which included superficial reasons like the presence of the color red or word balloons on the cover, or that the perceived crudeness of the interior art was somehow more appealing to readers. When Lee learned about DC's subsequent experimental attempts to imitate these perceived details, he amused himself by arranging direct defiance of those assumptions in Marvel's publications as sales strengthened further to frustrate the competition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Reed|title=Slugfest: Inside the Epic, 50-year Battle between Marvel and DC|date=2017|publisher=Da Capo Press|pages=11\u201313}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this ignorance of Marvel's true appeal did not extend to some of the writing talent during this period, from which there were some attempts to emulate Marvel's narrative approach.

DC significantly lightened the [[tone (literature)|tone]] of many DC comics\u2014particularly ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]''\u2014to better complement the \"camp\" tone of the TV series.

With the growing popularity of upstart rival [[Marvel Comics]] threatening to topple DC from its longtime number-one position in the comics industry, he attempted to infuse the company with more focus towards marketing new and existing titles and characters with more adult sensibilities towards an emerging older age group of superhero comic book fans that grew out of Marvel's efforts to market their superhero [[line (comics)|line]] to college-aged adults. He also recruited major talents such as ex-Marvel artist and [[Spider-Man]] co-creator [[Steve Ditko]] and promising newcomers [[Neal Adams]] and [[Denny O'Neil]] and replaced some existing DC editors with artist-editors, including [[Joe Kubert]] and [[Dick Giordano]], to give DC's output a more artistic critical eye.\n\n===Kinney National Company/Warner Communications subsidiary (1967\u20131990)===\nIn 1967, National Periodical Publications was purchased by [[Kinney National Company]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/dc.htm |title=DC Comics |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> which purchased [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] in 1969. Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in 1972 (as [[National Kinney Corporation]]) and changed its name to [[Warner Communications|Warner Communications Inc.]]\n\nIn 1970, [[Jack Kirby]] moved from Marvel Comics to DC, at the end of the [[Silver Age of Comics]], in which Kirby's contributions to Marvel played a large, integral role. Given carte blanche to write and illustrate his own stories, he created a handful of thematically linked series he called collectively [[Fourth World (comics)|The Fourth World]]. In the existing series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' and in his own, newly launched series ''[[New Gods]]'', ''[[Mister Miracle]]'', and ''[[Forever People|The Forever People]]'', Kirby introduced such enduring characters and concepts as archvillain [[Darkseid]] and the other-dimensional realm [[Apokolips]]. Furthermore, Kirby intended their stories to be reprinted in collected editions, in a publishing format that was later called the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], which became a standard industry practice decades later. While sales were respectable, they did not meet DC management's initially high expectations, and also suffered from a lack of comprehension and internal support from Infantino. By 1973 the \"Fourth World\" was all cancelled, although Kirby's conceptions soon became integral to the broadening of the DC Universe, especially after the major toy company, [[Kenner Products]], judged them ideal for their [[action figure]] adaptation of the [[DC Universe]], the [[Super Powers Collection]].,<ref>{{cite book|last=Gaiman|first=Mark Evanier ; introduction by Neil|title=Kirby : King of Comics|year=2008|publisher=Abrams|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-8109-9447-8|page=197}}</ref> Obligated by his contract, Kirby created other unrelated series for DC, including ''[[Kamandi]]'', ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'', and ''[[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]]'', before ultimately returning to Marvel Comics.\n\n===The Bronze Age===\n{{Main|Bronze Age of Comic Books}}\n\nFollowing the science-fiction innovations of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], the comics of the 1970s and 1980s became known as the Bronze Age, as fantasy gave way to more [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] and sometimes darker themes. Illegal drug use, banned by the [[Comics Code Authority]], explicitly appeared in comics for the first time in Marvel Comics' story \"[[Green Goblin Reborn!]]\" in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' No. 96 (May 1971), and after the Code's updating in response, DC offered a drug-fueled storyline in writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]]' ''[[Green Lantern]]'', beginning with the story \"[[Snowbirds Don't Fly]]\" in the retitled ''Green Lantern / Green Arrow'' No. 85 (September 1971), which depicted [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], the teen sidekick of superhero archer [[Green Arrow]], as having become a heroin addict.\n\n[[Jenette Kahn]], a former children's magazine publisher, replaced Infantino as editorial director in January 1976. DC had attempted to compete with the now-surging Marvel by dramatically increasing its output and attempting to win the market by flooding it. This included launching series featuring such new characters as ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]'', as well as an increasing array of non-superhero titles, in an attempt to recapture the pre-[[Fredric Wertham|Wertham]] days of post-War comicdom. In June 1978, five months before the release of the [[Superman (1978 film)|first Superman movie]], Kahn expanded the [[line (comics)|line]] further, increasing the number of titles and story pages, and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents. Most series received eight-page back-up features while some had full-length twenty-five-page stories. This was a move the company called the \"DC Explosion\".<ref>Kahn, Jenette.

As it happened, the implementation of these incentives proved opportune considering Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief, [[Jim Shooter]], was alienating much of his company's creative staff with his authoritarian manner and major talents there went to DC like [[Roy Thomas]], [[Gene Colan]], [[Marv Wolfman]], and [[George Perez]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tucker |title=Slugfest |pages=112\u20133 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, emulating the era's new television form, the [[miniseries]] while addressing the matter of an excessive number of ongoing titles fizzling out within a few issues of their start, DC created the industry concept of the comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable open-ended commitments. The first such title was ''[[World of Krypton]]'' in 1979, and its positive results lead to subsequent similar titles and later more ambitious productions like ''[[Camelot 3000]]'' for the direct market in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/columns/A+/archives/071103.html|title=GHM Columns : GHM Staff : Steve Higgins A+ Graphic Novels &#93|website=Newcomicreviews.com|access-date=March 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204110919/http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/columns/A+/archives/071103.html|archive-date=February 4, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThese changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole, and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel, and encourage stability on individual titles. In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'', by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George P\u00e9rez]], two popular talents with a history of success. Their superhero-team comic, superficially similar to Marvel's ensemble series ''[[X-Men]]'', but rooted in DC history, earned significant sales<ref>MacDonald, Heidi D. \"DC's Titanic Success\", ''The Comics Journal'' No. 76 (October 1982), pp. 46\u201351.</ref> in part due to the stability of the creative team, who both continued with the title for six full years. In addition, Wolfman and P\u00e9rez took advantage of the limited-series option to create a spin-off title, ''Tales of the New Teen Titans'', to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title.\n\n===Modern Age===\n{{Main|Modern Age of Comic Books}}\n\nThis successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans led DC's editors<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/why-teen-titans-dc-comics-most-important-but-undervalued-franchises|title=Why TEEN TITANS Is DC Comics' Most Important (But Undervalued) Franchise \u2013 Nerdist|date=August 30, 2016|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118073919/https://nerdist.com/why-teen-titans-dc-comics-most-important-but-undervalued-franchises/|archive-date=November 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> to seek the same for the wider [[DC Universe]]. The result, the Wolfman/P\u00e9rez 12-issue limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the characters' complicated backstory and continuity discrepancies. A companion publication, two volumes entitled ''The History of the DC Universe'', set out the revised history of the major DC characters. ''Crisis'' featured many key deaths that shaped the DC Universe for the following decades, and it separated the timeline of DC publications into pre- and post-\"Crisis\".\n\nMeanwhile, a parallel update had started in the non-superhero and horror titles. Since early 1984, the work of British writer [[Alan Moore]] had revitalized the horror series ''[[Swamp Thing|The Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'', and soon numerous British writers, including [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Grant Morrison]], began freelancing for the company. The resulting influx of sophisticated horror-fantasy material led to DC in 1993 establishing the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] mature-readers imprint, which did not subscribe to the [[Comics Code Authority]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vertigo/4010-521|title=Vertigo (Publisher) \u2013 Comic Vine|website=Comic Vine|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715180039/https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vertigo/4010-521/|archive-date=July 15, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTwo DC limited series, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and ''[[Watchmen]]'' by Moore and artist [[Dave Gibbons]], drew attention in the mainstream press for their dark psychological complexity and promotion of the antihero.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432973/batmans-dark-side |title=Batman's Dark Side |access-date=July 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407131449/http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432973/batmans-dark-side |archive-date=April 7, 2017 |url-status=live  |date=March 26, 2016 }}</ref> These titles helped pave the way for comics to be more widely accepted in literary-criticism circles and to make inroads into the book industry, with collected editions of these series as commercially successful [[trade paperbacks]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the end of many long-running DC [[war comics]], including series that had been in print since the 1960s. These titles, all with over 100 issues, included ''[[Sgt. Rock (comics)|Sgt. Rock]]'', ''[[G.I. Combat]]'', ''[[The Unknown Soldier (comics)|The Unknown Soldier]]'', and ''[[Weird War Tales]]''.\n\n===Time Warner/AOL Time Warner/WarnerMedia unit (1990\u2013present)===\nIn March 1989, Warner Communications merged with [[Time Inc.]], making DC Comics a subsidiary of Time Warner. In June, the [[Batman (1989 film)|first Tim Burton directed Batman movie]] was released, and DC began publishing its hardcover series of [[DC Archive Editions]], collections of many of their early, key comics series, featuring rare and expensive stories unseen by many modern fans. Restoration for many of the Archive Editions was handled by Rick Keene with colour restoration by DC's long-time resident colourist, [[Bob LeRose]]. These collections attempted to retroactively credit many of the writers and artists who had worked without much recognition for DC during the early period of comics when individual credits were few and far between.\n\nThe comics industry experienced a brief boom in the early 1990s, thanks to a combination of speculative purchasing (mass purchase of the books as collectible items, with intent to resell at a higher value as the rising value of older issues, was thought to imply that ''all'' comics would rise dramatically in price) and several storylines which gained attention from the mainstream media. DC's extended storylines in which [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]], [[Batman: Knightfall|Batman was crippled]] and superhero [[Emerald Twilight|''Green Lantern'' turned into the supervillain Parallax]] resulted in dramatically increased sales, but the increases were as temporary as the hero's replacements. Sales dropped off as the industry went into a major slump, while manufactured \"collectables\" numbering in the millions replaced quality with quantity until fans and speculators alike deserted the medium in droves.\n\nDC's [[Piranha Press]] and other imprints (including the mature readers [[line (comics)|line]] [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]], and [[Helix (comics)|Helix]], a short-lived science fiction imprint) were introduced to facilitate compartmentalized diversification and allow for specialized marketing of individual product lines. They increased the use of non-traditional contractual arrangements, including the dramatic rise of creator-owned projects, leading to a significant increase in critically lauded work (much of it for Vertigo) and the licensing of material from other companies. DC also increased publication of book-store friendly formats, including [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] collections of individual serial comics, as well as original [[graphic novel]]s.\n\nOne of the other imprints was [[Impact Comics]] from 1991 to 1992 in which the [[Archie Comics]] superheroes were licensed and revamped.<ref>{{cite news |last=Arrant |first=Chris |title=Completing the Red Circle: Talking to JMS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/2773-completing-the-red-circle-talking-to-jms.html |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |work=[[Newsarama]] |date=April 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224714/http://www.newsarama.com/2773-completing-the-red-circle-talking-to-jms.html |archive-date=December 2, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Markstein |first=Don |title=Archie (MLJ) Comics |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vzfkTHvJWnIJ:www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm+http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm&cd=1&ct=clnk&gl=us |archivedate=April 13, 2013 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> The stories in the line were part of its own shared universe.<ref name=cbr>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21346 \"JMS Circles the DC Universe in Red\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008225108/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21346 |date=October 8, 2013 }}.

Although the Milestone line ceased publication after a few years, it yielded the popular animated series ''[[Static Shock]]''. DC established [[Paradox Press]] to publish material such as the large-format ''Big Book of...'' series of multi-artist interpretations on individual themes, and such crime fiction as the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition (comics)|Road to Perdition]]''. In 1998, DC purchased [[WildStorm]] Comics, [[Jim Lee]]'s imprint under the [[Image Comics]] banner, continuing it for many years as a wholly separate imprint \u2013 and [[Wildstorm Universe|fictional universe]] \u2013 with its own style and audience. As part of this purchase, DC also began to publish titles under the fledgling WildStorm sub-imprint [[America's Best Comics (DC)|America's Best Comics]] (ABC), a series of titles created by [[Alan Moore]], including ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Tom Strong]]'', and ''[[Promethea]]''. Moore strongly contested this situation, and DC eventually stopped publishing ABC.\n\n===2000s===\nIn March 2003 DC acquired publishing and merchandising rights to the long-running fantasy series ''[[Elfquest]]'', previously self-published by creators [[Wendy and Richard Pini]] under their [[WaRP Graphics]] publication banner. This series then followed another non-DC title, [[Tower Comics]]' series [[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]], in collection into DC Archive Editions. In 2004 DC temporarily acquired the North American publishing rights to graphic novels from European publishers [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]] and [[Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9s|Humanoids]]. It also rebranded its younger-audience titles with the mascot [[Johnny DC]] and established the [[CMX (comics)|CMX]] imprint to reprint translated [[manga]]. In 2006, CMX took over from [[Dark Horse Comics]] publication of the webcomic ''[[Megatokyo]]'' in print form. DC also took advantage of the demise of [[Kitchen Sink Press]] and acquired the rights to much of the work of [[Will Eisner]], such as his ''[[The Spirit]]'' series and his graphic novels.\n\nIn 2004, DC began laying the groundwork for a full continuity-reshuffling sequel to ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', promising substantial changes to the DC Universe (and side-stepping the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' event which similarly tried to [[Comics vocabulary#Retcon|ret-con]] the history of the DCU). In 2005, the critically lauded ''[[Batman Begins]]'' film was released; also, the company published several limited series establishing increasingly escalated conflicts among DC's heroes, with events climaxing in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series. Immediately after this event, DC's ongoing series jumped [[One Year Later|forward a full year]] in their in-story continuity, as DC launched a weekly series, ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', to gradually fill in the missing time. Concurrently, DC lost the copyright to \"Superboy\" (while retaining the trademark) when the heirs of [[Jerry Siegel]] used a provision of the 1976 revision to the copyright law to regain ownership.\n\nIn 2005, DC launched its \"[[All Star DC Comics|All-Star]]\" line (evoking the title of the [[All Star Comics|1940s publication]]), designed to feature some of the company's best-known characters in stories that eschewed the long and convoluted continuity of the DC Universe. The line began with ''All-Star Batman & Robin the Boy Wonder'' and ''All-Star Superman'', with ''All-Star Wonder Woman'' and ''All-Star Batgirl'' announced in 2006 but neither being released nor scheduled as of the end of 2009.<ref>{{cite web |last=Brady |first=Matt |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=81341 |title=Adam Hughes on His New Exclusive & All Star Wonder Woman |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=August 21, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830202046/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=81341 |archivedate=August 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\nDC licensed characters from the [[Archie Comics]] imprint [[Red Circle Comics]] by 2007.<ref>{{cite web |last=Renaud |first=Jeffrey |date=October 30, 2008 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18636 |title=JMS Gets Brave & Bold with Archie Gang |publisher=ComicBookResources.com |access-date=May 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706132846/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18636 |archive-date=July 6, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> They appeared in the Red Circle line, based in the DC Universe, with a series of [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]] followed by a miniseries that lead into two ongoing titles, each lasting 10 issues.<ref name=\"cbr\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120824-DiDio.html |title=20 Answers and 1 Question With Dan DiDio: Holiday Surprise |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=December 24, 2008 |access-date=May 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829011736/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120824-DiDio.html |archive-date=August 29, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nIn 2011, DC rebooted all of its running titles following the [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] storyline.

The letters \"DC\" stood for ''Detective Comics'', the name of Batman's flagship title. The small logo, with no background, read simply, \"A DC Publication\".\n\nThe November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo. This version was almost twice the size of the previous one and was the first version with a white background. The name \"Superman\" was added to \"A DC Publication\", effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman. This logo was the first to occupy the top-left corner of the cover, where the logo has usually resided since. The company now referred to itself in its advertising as \"Superman-DC\".\n\nIn November 1949, the logo was modified to incorporate the company's formal name, National Comics Publications. This logo also served as the round body of Johnny DC, DC's [[mascot]] in the 1960s.\n\nIn October 1970, DC briefly retired the circular logo in favour of a simple \"DC\" in a rectangle with the name of the title, or the star of the book; the logo on many issues of ''Action Comics'', for example, read \"DC Superman\". An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle. For books that did not have a single star, such as [[Anthology|anthologies]] like ''[[House of Mystery]]'' or team series such as ''Justice League of America'', the title and \"DC\" appeared in a stylized logo, such as a bat for \"House of Mystery\". This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as trademarks, and was similar to Marvel's contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding.\n\nDC's \"100 Page Super-Spectacular\" titles and later 100-page and \"Giant\" issues published from 1972 to 1974 featured a logo exclusive to these editions: the letters \"DC\" in a simple [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]] within a circle. A variant had the letters in a square.\n\nThe July 1972 DC titles featured a new circular logo. The letters \"DC\" were rendered in a block-like typeface that remained through later logo revisions until 2005. The title of the book usually appeared inside the circle, either above or below the letters.\n\nIn December 1973, this logo was modified with the addition of the words \"The Line of DC Super-Stars\" and the star motif that continued in later logos. This logo was placed in the top center of the cover from August 1975 to October 1976.\n\nWhen Jenette Kahn became DC's publisher in late 1976, she commissioned graphic designer [[Milton Glaser]] to design a new logo. Popularly referred to as the \"DC bullet\", this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles. Although it varied in size and colour and was at times cropped by the edges of the cover, or briefly rotated 4 degrees, it remained essentially unchanged for nearly three decades. Despite logo changes since 2005, the old \"DC bullet\" continues to be used only on the [[DC Archive Editions]] series.\n\nIn July 1987, DC released variant editions of ''Justice League'' No. 3 and ''The Fury of Firestorm'' No. 61 with a new DC logo. It featured a picture of Superman in a circle surrounded by the words \"SUPERMAN COMICS\". The company released these variants to newsstands in certain markets as a marketing test.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rozakis |first1=Bob |title=Conspiracy? Icons?

In addition to comics, it was designed for DC properties in other media, which was used for movies since ''[[Batman Begins]]'', with ''[[Superman Returns]]'' showing the logo's normal variant, and the TV series ''[[Smallville]]'', the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and others, as well as for [[collectible]]s and other merchandise.

DC purchased many of their competitors' comic stables, including [[Fawcett Comics]], whose Beck-created Captain Marvel was central to a lawsuit with DC.]]\n\nThe company began to move aggressively against what it saw as [[copyright infringement|copyright-violating]] imitations from other companies, such as [[Fox Comics]]' [[Wonder Man (Fox Publications)|Wonder Man]], which (according to court testimony) Fox started as a copy of Superman. This extended to DC suing [[Fawcett Comics]] over [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], at the time comics' top-selling character (see ''[[National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.]]''). Faced with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy if it lost, Fawcett capitulated in 1953 and ceased publishing comics. Years later, Fawcett sold the rights for Captain Marvel to DC\u2014which in 1972 revived Captain Marvel in the new title ''Shazam!'' featuring artwork by his creator, [[C. C. Beck]]. In the meantime, the abandoned trademark had been seized by [[Marvel Comics]] in 1967, with the creation of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|their Captain Marvel]], forbidding the DC comic itself to be called that. While Captain Marvel did not recapture his old popularity, he later appeared in a Saturday morning [[Shazam! (TV series)|live action TV adaptation]] and gained a prominent place in the mainstream continuity DC calls the [[DC Universe]].\n\nWhen the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s, the company focused on such genres as science fiction, [[Western comics|Westerns]], [[humour|humor]], and [[Romance comics|romance]]. DC also published [[Crime comics|crime]] and [[Horror comics|horror]] titles, but relatively tame ones, and thus avoided the mid-1950s backlash against such comics. A handful of the most popular superhero-titles, including ''Action Comics'' and ''Detective Comics'', the medium's two longest-running titles, continued publication.\n\n===Silver Age===\n{{Main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}\n\nIn the mid-1950s, editorial director [[Irwin Donenfeld]] and publisher Liebowitz directed editor [[Julius Schwartz]] (whose roots lay in the science-fiction book market) to produce a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] story in the try-out title ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''. Instead of reviving the old character, Schwartz had writers [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]], [[penciller|penciler]] [[Carmine Infantino]], and [[inker]] [[Joe Kubert]] create an entirely new super-speedster, updating and modernizing the Flash's civilian identity, costume, and origin with a science-fiction bent. The Flash's reimagining in ''Showcase'' No. 4 (October 1956) proved sufficiently popular that it soon led to a similar revamping of the [[Green Lantern]] character, the introduction of the modern all-star team [[Justice League of America]] (JLA), and many more superheroes, heralding what historians and fans call the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].\n\nNational did not reimagine its continuing characters (primarily Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman), but radically overhauled them. The Superman family of titles, under editor [[Mort Weisinger]], introduced such enduring characters as [[Supergirl]], [[Bizarro]], and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The Batman titles, under editor Jack Schiff, introduced the successful [[Batwoman]], [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl]], [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]] in an attempt to modernize the strip with non-science-fiction elements. Schwartz, together with artist Infantino, then revitalized Batman in what the company promoted as the \"New Look\", re-emphasizing Batman as a detective. Meanwhile, editor Kanigher successfully introduced a whole family of Wonder Woman characters having fantastic adventures in a mythological context.\n\nSince the 1940s, when Superman, Batman, and many of the company's other heroes began appearing in stories together, DC's characters inhabited a shared [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that, decades later, was dubbed the \"[[DC Universe]]\" by fans. With the story \"[[Flash of Two Worlds]]\", in ''Flash'' No. 123 (September 1961), editor Schwartz (with writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artists Infantino and [[Joe Giella]]) introduced a concept that allowed slotting the 1930s and 1940s [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] heroes into this continuity via the explanation that they lived on an other-dimensional \"Earth 2\", as opposed to the modern heroes' \"Earth 1\"\u2014in the process creating the foundation for what was later called the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]].\n\nDC's introduction of the reimagined superheroes did not go unnoticed by other comics companies. In 1961, with DC's JLA as the specific spur,{{refn|Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, either [[Jack Liebowitz]] or [[Irwin Donenfeld]] of DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications)<!--also known as name is mentioned here because Stan Lee says \"National Comics\" in quote directly below this paragraph--> bragged about DC's success with the Justice League (which had debuted in ''The Brave and the Bold'' No. 28 [February 1960] before going on to its own title) to publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] (whose holdings included the nascent [[Marvel Comics]], which was being distributed by DC's Independent News at this time.) during a game of golf.\n<br /><br />\nHowever, film producer and comics historian [[Michael Uslan]] partly debunked the story in a letter published in ''Alter Ego'' No. 43 (December 2004), pp. 43\u201344\n{{quote|Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue.

Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces&nbsp;...

According to Lee in ''Origins of Marvel Comics'' ([[Marvel Fireside Books|Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books]], 1974), p. 16:\n\"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called ''The'' {{sic}} ''Justice League of America'' and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ...

Retrieved June 11, 2008.</ref> Reportedly, DC ignored the initial success of Marvel with this editorial change until its consistently strengthening sales, albeit also benefiting Independent News' business as their distributor as well, made that impossible. That commercial situation especially applied with Marvel's superior [[sell-through]] percentage numbers which were typically 70% to DC's roughly 50%, which meant DC's publications were barely making a profit in comparison after returns from the distributors were calculated while Marvel was making an excellent profit by comparison.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Reed |title=Slugfest: In the Epic 50-Year Battle between Marvel and DC |date=2017 |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=xiii }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the senior DC staff were reportedly at a loss at this time to understand how this small publishing house was achieving this increasingly threatening commercial strength. For instance, when Marvel's product was examined in a meeting, Marvel's emphasis on more sophisticated character-based narrative and artist-driven visual storytelling was apparently ignored for self-deluding guesses at the brand's popularity which included superficial reasons like the presence of the color red or word balloons on the cover, or that the perceived crudeness of the interior art was somehow more appealing to readers. When Lee learned about DC's subsequent experimental attempts to imitate these perceived details, he amused himself by arranging direct defiance of those assumptions in Marvel's publications as sales strengthened further to frustrate the competition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Reed|title=Slugfest: Inside the Epic, 50-year Battle between Marvel and DC|date=2017|publisher=Da Capo Press|pages=11\u201313}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this ignorance of Marvel's true appeal did not extend to some of the writing talent during this period, from which there were some attempts to emulate Marvel's narrative approach.

With the growing popularity of upstart rival [[Marvel Comics]] threatening to topple DC from its longtime number-one position in the comics industry, he attempted to infuse the company with more focus towards marketing new and existing titles and characters with more adult sensibilities towards an emerging older age group of superhero comic book fans that grew out of Marvel's efforts to market their superhero [[line (comics)|line]] to college-aged adults. He also recruited major talents such as ex-Marvel artist and [[Spider-Man]] co-creator [[Steve Ditko]] and promising newcomers [[Neal Adams]] and [[Denny O'Neil]] and replaced some existing DC editors with artist-editors, including [[Joe Kubert]] and [[Dick Giordano]], to give DC's output a more artistic critical eye.\n\n===Kinney National Company/Warner Communications subsidiary (1967\u20131990)===\nIn 1967, National Periodical Publications was purchased by [[Kinney National Company]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/dc.htm |title=DC Comics |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> which purchased [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] in 1969. Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in 1972 (as [[National Kinney Corporation]]) and changed its name to [[Warner Communications|Warner Communications Inc.]]\n\nIn 1970, [[Jack Kirby]] moved from Marvel Comics to DC, at the end of the [[Silver Age of Comics]], in which Kirby's contributions to Marvel played a large, integral role. Given carte blanche to write and illustrate his own stories, he created a handful of thematically linked series he called collectively [[Fourth World (comics)|The Fourth World]]. In the existing series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' and in his own, newly launched series ''[[New Gods]]'', ''[[Mister Miracle]]'', and ''[[Forever People|The Forever People]]'', Kirby introduced such enduring characters and concepts as archvillain [[Darkseid]] and the other-dimensional realm [[Apokolips]]. Furthermore, Kirby intended their stories to be reprinted in collected editions, in a publishing format that was later called the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], which became a standard industry practice decades later. While sales were respectable, they did not meet DC management's initially high expectations, and also suffered from a lack of comprehension and internal support from Infantino. By 1973 the \"Fourth World\" was all cancelled, although Kirby's conceptions soon became integral to the broadening of the DC Universe, especially after the major toy company, [[Kenner Products]], judged them ideal for their [[action figure]] adaptation of the [[DC Universe]], the [[Super Powers Collection]].,<ref>{{cite book|last=Gaiman|first=Mark Evanier ; introduction by Neil|title=Kirby : King of Comics|year=2008|publisher=Abrams|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-8109-9447-8|page=197}}</ref> Obligated by his contract, Kirby created other unrelated series for DC, including ''[[Kamandi]]'', ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'', and ''[[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]]'', before ultimately returning to Marvel Comics.\n\n===The Bronze Age===\n{{Main|Bronze Age of Comic Books}}\n\nFollowing the science-fiction innovations of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], the comics of the 1970s and 1980s became known as the Bronze Age, as fantasy gave way to more [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] and sometimes darker themes. Illegal drug use, banned by the [[Comics Code Authority]], explicitly appeared in comics for the first time in Marvel Comics' story \"[[Green Goblin Reborn!]]\" in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' No. 96 (May 1971), and after the Code's updating in response, DC offered a drug-fueled storyline in writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]]' ''[[Green Lantern]]'', beginning with the story \"[[Snowbirds Don't Fly]]\" in the retitled ''Green Lantern / Green Arrow'' No. 85 (September 1971), which depicted [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], the teen sidekick of superhero archer [[Green Arrow]], as having become a heroin addict.\n\n[[Jenette Kahn]], a former children's magazine publisher, replaced Infantino as editorial director in January 1976. DC had attempted to compete with the now-surging Marvel by dramatically increasing its output and attempting to win the market by flooding it. This included launching series featuring such new characters as ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]'', as well as an increasing array of non-superhero titles, in an attempt to recapture the pre-[[Fredric Wertham|Wertham]] days of post-War comicdom. In June 1978, five months before the release of the [[Superman (1978 film)|first Superman movie]], Kahn expanded the [[line (comics)|line]] further, increasing the number of titles and story pages, and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents.

To that end\u2014and following the example of [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Mediascene |authorlink=Jim Steranko |last=Steranko |first=Jim |issue=11 |date=February 1975 |page=? |quote=Atlas/Seaboard publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]]'s [[Goliath (Bible)|David and Goliath]] strategy is insidiously simple and outrageous\u2014possibly even considered dirty tactics by the competition\u2014[and consists of] such [things] as higher page rates, artwork returned to the artist, rights to the creation of an original character, and a certain amount of professional courtesy.}}</ref> and such independent companies as [[Eclipse Comics]]\u2014DC began to offer [[royalties]] in place of the industry-standard [[work for hire|work-for-hire]] agreement in which creators worked for a flat fee and signed away all rights, giving talent a financial incentive tied to the success of their work. As it happened, the implementation of these incentives proved opportune considering Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief, [[Jim Shooter]], was alienating much of his company's creative staff with his authoritarian manner and major talents there went to DC like [[Roy Thomas]], [[Gene Colan]], [[Marv Wolfman]], and [[George Perez]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tucker |title=Slugfest |pages=112\u20133 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, emulating the era's new television form, the [[miniseries]] while addressing the matter of an excessive number of ongoing titles fizzling out within a few issues of their start, DC created the industry concept of the comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable open-ended commitments. The first such title was ''[[World of Krypton]]'' in 1979, and its positive results lead to subsequent similar titles and later more ambitious productions like ''[[Camelot 3000]]'' for the direct market in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/columns/A+/archives/071103.html|title=GHM Columns : GHM Staff : Steve Higgins A+ Graphic Novels &#93|website=Newcomicreviews.com|access-date=March 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204110919/http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/columns/A+/archives/071103.html|archive-date=February 4, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThese changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole, and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel, and encourage stability on individual titles. In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'', by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George P\u00e9rez]], two popular talents with a history of success. Their superhero-team comic, superficially similar to Marvel's ensemble series ''[[X-Men]]'', but rooted in DC history, earned significant sales<ref>MacDonald, Heidi D. \"DC's Titanic Success\", ''The Comics Journal'' No. 76 (October 1982), pp. 46\u201351.</ref> in part due to the stability of the creative team, who both continued with the title for six full years. In addition, Wolfman and P\u00e9rez took advantage of the limited-series option to create a spin-off title, ''Tales of the New Teen Titans'', to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title.\n\n===Modern Age===\n{{Main|Modern Age of Comic Books}}\n\nThis successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans led DC's editors<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/why-teen-titans-dc-comics-most-important-but-undervalued-franchises|title=Why TEEN TITANS Is DC Comics' Most Important (But Undervalued) Franchise \u2013 Nerdist|date=August 30, 2016|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118073919/https://nerdist.com/why-teen-titans-dc-comics-most-important-but-undervalued-franchises/|archive-date=November 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> to seek the same for the wider [[DC Universe]]. The result, the Wolfman/P\u00e9rez 12-issue limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the characters' complicated backstory and continuity discrepancies. A companion publication, two volumes entitled ''The History of the DC Universe'', set out the revised history of the major DC characters. ''Crisis'' featured many key deaths that shaped the DC Universe for the following decades, and it separated the timeline of DC publications into pre- and post-\"Crisis\".\n\nMeanwhile, a parallel update had started in the non-superhero and horror titles. Since early 1984, the work of British writer [[Alan Moore]] had revitalized the horror series ''[[Swamp Thing|The Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'', and soon numerous British writers, including [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Grant Morrison]], began freelancing for the company. The resulting influx of sophisticated horror-fantasy material led to DC in 1993 establishing the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] mature-readers imprint, which did not subscribe to the [[Comics Code Authority]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vertigo/4010-521|title=Vertigo (Publisher) \u2013 Comic Vine|website=Comic Vine|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715180039/https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vertigo/4010-521/|archive-date=July 15, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTwo DC limited series, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and ''[[Watchmen]]'' by Moore and artist [[Dave Gibbons]], drew attention in the mainstream press for their dark psychological complexity and promotion of the antihero.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432973/batmans-dark-side |title=Batman's Dark Side |access-date=July 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407131449/http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432973/batmans-dark-side |archive-date=April 7, 2017 |url-status=live  |date=March 26, 2016 }}</ref> These titles helped pave the way for comics to be more widely accepted in literary-criticism circles and to make inroads into the book industry, with collected editions of these series as commercially successful [[trade paperbacks]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the end of many long-running DC [[war comics]], including series that had been in print since the 1960s. These titles, all with over 100 issues, included ''[[Sgt. Rock (comics)|Sgt. Rock]]'', ''[[G.I. Combat]]'', ''[[The Unknown Soldier (comics)|The Unknown Soldier]]'', and ''[[Weird War Tales]]''.\n\n===Time Warner/AOL Time Warner/WarnerMedia unit (1990\u2013present)===\nIn March 1989, Warner Communications merged with [[Time Inc.]], making DC Comics a subsidiary of Time Warner. In June, the [[Batman (1989 film)|first Tim Burton directed Batman movie]] was released, and DC began publishing its hardcover series of [[DC Archive Editions]], collections of many of their early, key comics series, featuring rare and expensive stories unseen by many modern fans. Restoration for many of the Archive Editions was handled by Rick Keene with colour restoration by DC's long-time resident colourist, [[Bob LeRose]]. These collections attempted to retroactively credit many of the writers and artists who had worked without much recognition for DC during the early period of comics when individual credits were few and far between.\n\nThe comics industry experienced a brief boom in the early 1990s, thanks to a combination of speculative purchasing (mass purchase of the books as collectible items, with intent to resell at a higher value as the rising value of older issues, was thought to imply that ''all'' comics would rise dramatically in price) and several storylines which gained attention from the mainstream media. DC's extended storylines in which [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]], [[Batman: Knightfall|Batman was crippled]] and superhero [[Emerald Twilight|''Green Lantern'' turned into the supervillain Parallax]] resulted in dramatically increased sales, but the increases were as temporary as the hero's replacements. Sales dropped off as the industry went into a major slump, while manufactured \"collectables\" numbering in the millions replaced quality with quantity until fans and speculators alike deserted the medium in droves.\n\nDC's [[Piranha Press]] and other imprints (including the mature readers [[line (comics)|line]] [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]], and [[Helix (comics)|Helix]], a short-lived science fiction imprint) were introduced to facilitate compartmentalized diversification and allow for specialized marketing of individual product lines. They increased the use of non-traditional contractual arrangements, including the dramatic rise of creator-owned projects, leading to a significant increase in critically lauded work (much of it for Vertigo) and the licensing of material from other companies. DC also increased publication of book-store friendly formats, including [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] collections of individual serial comics, as well as original [[graphic novel]]s.\n\nOne of the other imprints was [[Impact Comics]] from 1991 to 1992 in which the [[Archie Comics]] superheroes were licensed and revamped.<ref>{{cite news |last=Arrant |first=Chris |title=Completing the Red Circle: Talking to JMS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/2773-completing-the-red-circle-talking-to-jms.html |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |work=[[Newsarama]] |date=April 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224714/http://www.newsarama.com/2773-completing-the-red-circle-talking-to-jms.html |archive-date=December 2, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Markstein |first=Don |title=Archie (MLJ) Comics |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vzfkTHvJWnIJ:www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm+http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm&cd=1&ct=clnk&gl=us |archivedate=April 13, 2013 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> The stories in the line were part of its own shared universe.<ref name=cbr>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21346 \"JMS Circles the DC Universe in Red\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008225108/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21346 |date=October 8, 2013 }}. Comic Book Resources. March 26, 2009</ref>\n\nDC entered into a publishing agreement with [[Milestone Media]] that gave DC a line of comics featuring a culturally and racially diverse range of superhero characters. Although the Milestone line ceased publication after a few years, it yielded the popular animated series ''[[Static Shock]]''. DC established [[Paradox Press]] to publish material such as the large-format ''Big Book of...'' series of multi-artist interpretations on individual themes, and such crime fiction as the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition (comics)|Road to Perdition]]''. In 1998, DC purchased [[WildStorm]] Comics, [[Jim Lee]]'s imprint under the [[Image Comics]] banner, continuing it for many years as a wholly separate imprint \u2013 and [[Wildstorm Universe|fictional universe]] \u2013 with its own style and audience. As part of this purchase, DC also began to publish titles under the fledgling WildStorm sub-imprint [[America's Best Comics (DC)|America's Best Comics]] (ABC), a series of titles created by [[Alan Moore]], including ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Tom Strong]]'', and ''[[Promethea]]''. Moore strongly contested this situation, and DC eventually stopped publishing ABC.\n\n===2000s===\nIn March 2003 DC acquired publishing and merchandising rights to the long-running fantasy series ''[[Elfquest]]'', previously self-published by creators [[Wendy and Richard Pini]] under their [[WaRP Graphics]] publication banner. This series then followed another non-DC title, [[Tower Comics]]' series [[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]], in collection into DC Archive Editions. In 2004 DC temporarily acquired the North American publishing rights to graphic novels from European publishers [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]] and [[Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9s|Humanoids]]. It also rebranded its younger-audience titles with the mascot [[Johnny DC]] and established the [[CMX (comics)|CMX]] imprint to reprint translated [[manga]]. In 2006, CMX took over from [[Dark Horse Comics]] publication of the webcomic ''[[Megatokyo]]'' in print form. DC also took advantage of the demise of [[Kitchen Sink Press]] and acquired the rights to much of the work of [[Will Eisner]], such as his ''[[The Spirit]]'' series and his graphic novels.\n\nIn 2004, DC began laying the groundwork for a full continuity-reshuffling sequel to ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', promising substantial changes to the DC Universe (and side-stepping the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' event which similarly tried to [[Comics vocabulary#Retcon|ret-con]] the history of the DCU). In 2005, the critically lauded ''[[Batman Begins]]'' film was released; also, the company published several limited series establishing increasingly escalated conflicts among DC's heroes, with events climaxing in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series. Immediately after this event, DC's ongoing series jumped [[One Year Later|forward a full year]] in their in-story continuity, as DC launched a weekly series, ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', to gradually fill in the missing time. Concurrently, DC lost the copyright to \"Superboy\" (while retaining the trademark) when the heirs of [[Jerry Siegel]] used a provision of the 1976 revision to the copyright law to regain ownership.\n\nIn 2005, DC launched its \"[[All Star DC Comics|All-Star]]\" line (evoking the title of the [[All Star Comics|1940s publication]]), designed to feature some of the company's best-known characters in stories that eschewed the long and convoluted continuity of the DC Universe. The line began with ''All-Star Batman & Robin the Boy Wonder'' and ''All-Star Superman'', with ''All-Star Wonder Woman'' and ''All-Star Batgirl'' announced in 2006 but neither being released nor scheduled as of the end of 2009.<ref>{{cite web |last=Brady |first=Matt |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=81341 |title=Adam Hughes on His New Exclusive & All Star Wonder Woman |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=August 21, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830202046/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=81341 |archivedate=August 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\nDC licensed characters from the [[Archie Comics]] imprint [[Red Circle Comics]] by 2007.<ref>{{cite web |last=Renaud |first=Jeffrey |date=October 30, 2008 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18636 |title=JMS Gets Brave & Bold with Archie Gang |publisher=ComicBookResources.com |access-date=May 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706132846/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18636 |archive-date=July 6, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> They appeared in the Red Circle line, based in the DC Universe, with a series of [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]] followed by a miniseries that lead into two ongoing titles, each lasting 10 issues.<ref name=\"cbr\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120824-DiDio.html |title=20 Answers and 1 Question With Dan DiDio: Holiday Surprise |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=December 24, 2008 |access-date=May 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829011736/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120824-DiDio.html |archive-date=August 29, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nIn 2011, DC rebooted all of its running titles following the [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] storyline.

The letters \"DC\" stood for ''Detective Comics'', the name of Batman's flagship title. The small logo, with no background, read simply, \"A DC Publication\".\n\nThe November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo. This version was almost twice the size of the previous one and was the first version with a white background. The name \"Superman\" was added to \"A DC Publication\", effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman. This logo was the first to occupy the top-left corner of the cover, where the logo has usually resided since. The company now referred to itself in its advertising as \"Superman-DC\".\n\nIn November 1949, the logo was modified to incorporate the company's formal name, National Comics Publications. This logo also served as the round body of Johnny DC, DC's [[mascot]] in the 1960s.\n\nIn October 1970, DC briefly retired the circular logo in favour of a simple \"DC\" in a rectangle with the name of the title, or the star of the book; the logo on many issues of ''Action Comics'', for example, read \"DC Superman\". An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle. For books that did not have a single star, such as [[Anthology|anthologies]] like ''[[House of Mystery]]'' or team series such as ''Justice League of America'', the title and \"DC\" appeared in a stylized logo, such as a bat for \"House of Mystery\". This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as trademarks, and was similar to Marvel's contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding.\n\nDC's \"100 Page Super-Spectacular\" titles and later 100-page and \"Giant\" issues published from 1972 to 1974 featured a logo exclusive to these editions: the letters \"DC\" in a simple [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]] within a circle. A variant had the letters in a square.\n\nThe July 1972 DC titles featured a new circular logo. The letters \"DC\" were rendered in a block-like typeface that remained through later logo revisions until 2005. The title of the book usually appeared inside the circle, either above or below the letters.\n\nIn December 1973, this logo was modified with the addition of the words \"The Line of DC Super-Stars\" and the star motif that continued in later logos. This logo was placed in the top center of the cover from August 1975 to October 1976.\n\nWhen Jenette Kahn became DC's publisher in late 1976, she commissioned graphic designer [[Milton Glaser]] to design a new logo. Popularly referred to as the \"DC bullet\", this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles. Although it varied in size and colour and was at times cropped by the edges of the cover, or briefly rotated 4 degrees, it remained essentially unchanged for nearly three decades. Despite logo changes since 2005, the old \"DC bullet\" continues to be used only on the [[DC Archive Editions]] series.\n\nIn July 1987, DC released variant editions of ''Justice League'' No. 3 and ''The Fury of Firestorm'' No. 61 with a new DC logo. It featured a picture of Superman in a circle surrounded by the words \"SUPERMAN COMICS\". The company released these variants to newsstands in certain markets as a marketing test.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rozakis |first1=Bob |title=Conspiracy? Icons?

In addition to comics, it was designed for DC properties in other media, which was used for movies since ''[[Batman Begins]]'', with ''[[Superman Returns]]'' showing the logo's normal variant, and the TV series ''[[Smallville]]'', the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and others, as well as for [[collectible]]s and other merchandise.

His grievances against the governor stemmed from Berkeley's dismissive policy to the political challenges of its western frontier, particularly leaving Bacon out of his inner circle and refusing to allow Bacon to take part in fur trading with [[Native American tribes in Virginia|Native Americans]], and Berkeley refusing Bacon a military commission that would allow him to fight and attack Native Americans at his own discretion. Attacks by the [[Doeg people]] are credited with inciting the popular uprising against Berkeley for failing to address the demands of the colonists regarding the safety of the frontier. The Doeg people had both traded and made war on the Virginia frontier.\n\nStarting in the 1650s, as English colonists began to settle the Northern Neck frontier, then known as Chicacoan (Secocowon), some Doeg, Patawomeck and Rappahannock began moving into the region as well and joined local tribes in disputing the settlers' claims to land and resources. In July 1666, the colonists declared war on them. By 1669, colonists had patented the land on the west of the Potomac as far north as My Lord's Island. By 1670, they had driven most of the Doeg out of the Virginia colony and into Maryland\u2014apart from those living beside the Nanzatico/Portobago in Caroline County, Virginia.\n\nThe English continued to harass the Doeg on the Northern Neck and in July 1675, a Doeg raiding party crossed the Potomac and stole hogs from Thomas Mathew, in retaliation for him not paying them for traded goods. Mathew and other colonists pursued them to Maryland and killed a group of Doeg, as well as innocent Susquehannock. A Doeg war party retaliated by killing Mathew's son and two servants on his plantation. {{Citation needed|reason=Whole paragraph unsubstantiated|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn retaliation, a Virginian militia led by Nathaniel Bacon entered Maryland, attacked the Doeg and besieged the Susquehannock. This precipitated the general reaction against natives by the Virginia Colony that resulted in \"Bacon's Rebellion\". In 1676 Bacon took his armed force to the Green Dragon Swamp on the upper Pamunkey River where he killed nearly fifty Pamunkey Indians, which lead to the chief Cockacoeske issuing orders to the rest of the tribe to escape. She ordered her tribe to not harm anyone and stay true to their treaty of peace.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ethan A.

The alliance between [[Indentured servitude in the Americas|European indentured servants]] and [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]] (many [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] until death or freed), united by their bond-servitude, disturbed the ruling class. The ruling class responded by hardening the racial caste of slavery in an attempt to divide the two races from subsequent united uprisings with the passage of the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]].<ref name=Foner>Eric Foner, ''Give Me Liberty!: An American History'' (New York: W.W.

In addition, many colonists wished to attack and claim  Native American frontier land westward, but they were denied permission by Gov. Berkeley.<ref name=\"Foner\" />  Many of these colonists were former indentured servants whose contracts had terminated and who were now free, looking for land.\n\nModern historians have suggested the rebellion may have been a power play by Bacon against Berkeley and his favoritism towards certain members of the court. While Bacon was on the court, he was not within Berkeley's inner circle of council members and disagreed with him on many issues.  Bacon's financial backers included men of wealth from outside Berkeley's circle of influence.<ref name=Foner />\n\nHistorian Peter Thompson argues that Bacon's motivation was a personal vendetta between  Berkeley and him. However, Bacon's followers used the rebellion as an effort to gain government recognition of the shared interests among all social classes of the colony in protecting the \"commonality\" and advancing its welfare.<ref>Peter Thompson, \"The Thief, the Householder, and the Commons: Languages of Class in Seventeenth-Century Virginia,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2006) 63#2 pp 253-280 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877353 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n== Rebellion ==\nWhen Sir William Berkeley refused to retaliate against the Native Americans, farmers gathered around at the report of a new raiding party. Nathaniel Bacon arrived with a quantity of brandy; after it was distributed, he was elected leader. Against Berkeley's orders, the group struck south until they came to the [[Occaneechi]] people. After convincing the Occaneechi to attack the [[Susquehannock]], Bacon and his men followed by killing most of the men, women, and children at the village. Upon their return, they discovered that Berkeley had called for new elections to the Burgesses to better address the Native American raids.<ref>John Berry, Francis Moryson, and Herbert Jefferys, \"A True Narrative of the Rise, Progress and Cessation of the Late Rebellion in Virginia, Most Humbly an Impartially Recorded by His Majesties Commissioners, Appointed to inquire into the Affairs of the Said Colony\", Ed. by Charles Andrews, in ''Narrative of the Insurrections 1675 to 1690'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1915, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref>\n\n[[File:A Fair Mark - Shoot.jpg|thumb|Governor Berkeley baring his breast for Bacon to shoot after refusing him a commission (1895 engraving)]]\nThe recomposed [[House of Burgesses]] enacted a number of sweeping reforms (known as [[Bacon's Laws]]). (Bacon was not serving his duty in the House; rather, he was at his plantation miles away.)

His grievances against the governor stemmed from Berkeley's dismissive policy to the political challenges of its western frontier, particularly leaving Bacon out of his inner circle and refusing to allow Bacon to take part in fur trading with [[Native American tribes in Virginia|Native Americans]], and Berkeley refusing Bacon a military commission that would allow him to fight and attack Native Americans at his own discretion. Attacks by the [[Doeg people]] are credited with inciting the popular uprising against Berkeley for failing to address the demands of the colonists regarding the safety of the frontier. The Doeg people had both traded and made war on the Virginia frontier.\n\nStarting in the 1650s, as English colonists began to settle the Northern Neck frontier, then known as Chicacoan (Secocowon), some Doeg, Patawomeck and Rappahannock began moving into the region as well and joined local tribes in disputing the settlers' claims to land and resources. In July 1666, the colonists declared war on them. By 1669, colonists had patented the land on the west of the Potomac as far north as My Lord's Island. By 1670, they had driven most of the Doeg out of the Virginia colony and into Maryland\u2014apart from those living beside the Nanzatico/Portobago in Caroline County, Virginia.\n\nThe English continued to harass the Doeg on the Northern Neck and in July 1675, a Doeg raiding party crossed the Potomac and stole hogs from Thomas Mathew, in retaliation for him not paying them for traded goods. Mathew and other colonists pursued them to Maryland and killed a group of Doeg, as well as innocent Susquehannock. A Doeg war party retaliated by killing Mathew's son and two servants on his plantation. {{Citation needed|reason=Whole paragraph unsubstantiated|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn retaliation, a Virginian militia led by Nathaniel Bacon entered Maryland, attacked the Doeg and besieged the Susquehannock. This precipitated the general reaction against natives by the Virginia Colony that resulted in \"Bacon's Rebellion\". In 1676 Bacon took his armed force to the Green Dragon Swamp on the upper Pamunkey River where he killed nearly fifty Pamunkey Indians, which lead to the chief Cockacoeske issuing orders to the rest of the tribe to escape. She ordered her tribe to not harm anyone and stay true to their treaty of peace.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ethan A.

In addition, many colonists wished to attack and claim  Native American frontier land westward, but they were denied permission by Gov. Berkeley.<ref name=\"Foner\" />  Many of these colonists were former indentured servants whose contracts had terminated and who were now free, looking for land.\n\nModern historians have suggested the rebellion may have been a power play by Bacon against Berkeley and his favoritism towards certain members of the court. While Bacon was on the court, he was not within Berkeley's inner circle of council members and disagreed with him on many issues.  Bacon's financial backers included men of wealth from outside Berkeley's circle of influence.<ref name=Foner />\n\nHistorian Peter Thompson argues that Bacon's motivation was a personal vendetta between  Berkeley and him. However, Bacon's followers used the rebellion as an effort to gain government recognition of the shared interests among all social classes of the colony in protecting the \"commonality\" and advancing its welfare.<ref>Peter Thompson, \"The Thief, the Householder, and the Commons: Languages of Class in Seventeenth-Century Virginia,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2006) 63#2 pp 253-280 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877353 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n== Rebellion ==\nWhen Sir William Berkeley refused to retaliate against the Native Americans, farmers gathered around at the report of a new raiding party. Nathaniel Bacon arrived with a quantity of brandy; after it was distributed, he was elected leader. Against Berkeley's orders, the group struck south until they came to the [[Occaneechi]] people. After convincing the Occaneechi to attack the [[Susquehannock]], Bacon and his men followed by killing most of the men, women, and children at the village. Upon their return, they discovered that Berkeley had called for new elections to the Burgesses to better address the Native American raids.<ref>John Berry, Francis Moryson, and Herbert Jefferys, \"A True Narrative of the Rise, Progress and Cessation of the Late Rebellion in Virginia, Most Humbly an Impartially Recorded by His Majesties Commissioners, Appointed to inquire into the Affairs of the Said Colony\", Ed. by Charles Andrews, in ''Narrative of the Insurrections 1675 to 1690'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1915, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref>\n\n[[File:A Fair Mark - Shoot.jpg|thumb|Governor Berkeley baring his breast for Bacon to shoot after refusing him a commission (1895 engraving)]]\nThe recomposed [[House of Burgesses]] enacted a number of sweeping reforms (known as [[Bacon's Laws]]).

The governor, however, refused to yield to the pressure. When Bacon had his men take aim at Berkeley, he responded by \"baring his breast\" to Bacon and told Bacon to shoot him. Seeing that the governor would not be moved, Bacon then had his men take aim at the assembled burgesses, who quickly granted Bacon his commission.

The most idolizing portrait of Bacon is found in ''Torchbearer of the Revolution'' (1940) by [[Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker]], which one scholar in 2011 called \"one of the worst books on Virginia that a reputable scholarly historian ever published.\"<ref>Tarter, Brent. \"Bacon's Rebellion, the Grievances of the People, and the Political Culture of Seventeenth-Century Virginia.\" The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 119, no. 1 (2011): 6; Rice, James D.

Pg. 204.</ref>  The central area of debate is Bacon's controversial character and complex disposition, as illustrated by [[Wilcomb Washburn]]'s ''The Governor and the Rebel'' (1957). Rather than singing Bacon's praises and chastising Berkeley's tyranny, Washburn found the roots of the rebellion in the colonists' intolerable demand to \"authorize the slaughter and dispossession of the innocent as well as the guilty.\"<ref>Washburn, ''The Governor and the Rebel'', p. 163</ref>\n\nMore nuanced approaches on Berkeley's supposed tyranny or mismanagement entertained specialist historians throughout the middle of the century, leading to a diversification of factors responsible for Virginia's contemporary instability. [[Wesley Frank Craven]] in the 1968 publication ''The Colonies in Transition'' argues that Berkeley's greatest failings took place during the revolt, near the end of his life.<ref>Craven, Wesley Frank.

Morgan]]'s classic 1975 ''[[American Slavery, American Freedom]]:  The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia'' connected the calamity of Bacon's Rebellion, namely the potential for lower-class revolt, with the colony's transition over to slavery: \"..But for those with eyes to see, there was an obvious lesson in the rebellion.  Resentment of an alien race might be more powerful than resentment of an upper class. Virginians did not immediately grasp it.  It would sink in as time went on ...\"<ref>Morgan, Edmund S.

John Midas is delighted when, through a magical gift, everything his lips touch turns into chocolate. The story is patterned after the myth of [[King Midas]], whose magic turned everything he touched into gold. The original illustrations were by [[Mildred Coughlin McNutt]], but another edition in the same year, a \"newly illustrated\" edition, had illustrations by Margot Apple and more pages.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/chocolate-touch/oclc/748389234 ''The Chocolate Touch''] at [[WorldCat]]</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nJohn Midas is a young boy with an intense, but obsessive love of confectionery, especially chocolate. The family doctor warns John that his health is poor, and until further notice, he is to eat only those foods that are conducive to a healthy body, much to the boy's disgruntlement. The doctor's orders are backed by John's folks, who dispose of their son's entire candy stash and have control over his spending money. Angered at having his life [[micromanagement|micromanaged]], John goes for a walk to clear his head. \n\nWhilst on his excursion he sees a coin on the ground, and thinks his good fortune as a way to buy a quick fix of chocolate, only to be dismayed to think the coin must be a novelty, as it is engraved with the image of a fat boy and the letters JM. Even so, John remarks the coin is unique as JM stands for John Midas, and decides to hang on to it. Also on his walk he comes across a candy store he has never seen before. Even more odd is that the store is run by a storekeeper whom John has never met before, but is friendly and refers to John by name and extols his chocolate as the finest ever. The confectioner offers John a box of his chocolates in exchange for the strange coin. That night before going to bed, John decides to have one final chocolate feast, only to be dismayed to find the box contains nothing save for an ordinary chocolate ball, which does not taste overly different from most other types of chocolate.\n\nThe next morning, John is amazed to find everything he eats tastes like chocolate. Then, the Chocolate Touch's effects go into full swing, and whatever touches his mouth turns to chocolate. However, he cannot properly hydrate himself this way. He then gets tired of eating chocolate and begins to view foods with [[nutrients]] as the tastiest delicacies on earth. Soon he damages his friendship with a girl when he spoils a birthday party when bobbing for apples later in the day. John's dad asks where he got the chocolate, but both are dismayed when the candy store had mysteriously vanished. They go to Dr. Cranium, the family physician, who tries to give John a tonic - John promptly spits out chocolate syrup and a chocolate spoon. Dr. Cranium decides to name the disease \"Cranium's disease\" and Mrs. Midas cries when she finds out about the disease. In order to comfort her, John tries to kiss his mother, who also turns to chocolate. Horrified, he rushes to the candy store, which has now reappeared, and the chocolate vendor offers him a choice between removing the Chocolate Touch and restoring his mother: John asks the storekeeper to help his mother and the storekeeper forgives him. Everything returns to normal, including Mrs. Midas, and the candy store disappears once and for all.\n\n==Themes==\nthere are no memes\n\n==Significance==\n''The Chocolate Touch'' is still in print, and is often used in grade school curricula throughout the United States.<ref>[http://www.emints.org/ethemes/resources/S00000564.shtml eMints National Center], \"Literature: \"The Chocolate Touch\" by Patrick Catling\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref><ref>[http://www.ksagclassroom.org/Lessons/genag/3-4/The_Chocolate_Touch.pdf ksagclassroom.org], ''The Chocolate Touch'' in course material and lesson plan, accessed 01-21-2009</ref>  It won the [[Massachusetts Children's Book Award]]<ref>[http://www.noblenet.org/webcat/booklists/mcba.htm The Massachusetts Children's Book Award], \"1989 - The Chocolate Touch by Patrick Catling\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref> in 1989, the Utah Children's Choice Honors Award in 1983,<ref>[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/664/Apple-Margot-1946.html Children's Choice Honors Award], \"Utah Children's Choice, 1983, for The Chocolate Touch\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref> and the Beehive Award<ref>[http://mtpleasantlib.org/children/book-lists/the-utah-beehive-awards/ The Utah Beehive Awards], \"Utah Children's Fiction Book Award - The Chocolate Touch By Patrick Catling (1983)\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref> from the Children's Literature Association of Utah in 1983.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Portal|Children's literature}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chocolate Touch, The}}\n[[Category:1952 American novels]]\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:Chocolate]]\n[[Category:Greco-Roman mythology in popular culture]]\n[[Category:1952 children's books]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Book by Patrick Skene Catling}}\n{{Infobox book\n| italic title   = <!--(see above)-->\n| name           =  The Chocolate Touch\n| image          = \n| image_size     = \n| alt            = \n| caption        = \n| author         = [[Patrick Skene Catling]]\n| audio_read_by  = \n| title_orig     = \n| orig_lang_code = \n| title_working  = \n| translator     = \n| illustrator    = Mildred Coughlin McNutt\n| cover_artist   = \n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| series         = \n| release_number = \n| subject        = \n| genre          = \n| set_in         = \n| published      = 1952 by [[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]]\n| media_type     = \n| pages          = 95\n| awards         = \n| isbn           = \n| oclc           = 1470182\n| dewey          = \n| congress       = \n}}'''''The Chocolate Touch''''' is a children's book by [[Patrick Skene Catling]], first published in the US in 1952.

The myth of King Midas, who loved gold above all things, targets [[greed]] as its main theme, while ''The Chocolate Touch'' highlights another of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]], [[gluttony]]. Both stories deal with self-centeredness versus compassion, though ''The Chocolate Touch'' does so in a manner accessible to children.\n\n==Significance==\n''The Chocolate Touch'' is still in print, and is often used in grade school curricula throughout the United States.<ref>[http://www.emints.org/ethemes/resources/S00000564.shtml eMints National Center], \"Literature: \"The Chocolate Touch\" by Patrick Catling\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref><ref>[http://www.ksagclassroom.org/Lessons/genag/3-4/The_Chocolate_Touch.pdf ksagclassroom.org], ''The Chocolate Touch'' in course material and lesson plan, accessed 01-21-2009</ref>  It won the [[Massachusetts Children's Book Award]]<ref>[http://www.noblenet.org/webcat/booklists/mcba.htm The Massachusetts Children's Book Award], \"1989 - The Chocolate Touch by Patrick Catling\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref> in 1989, the Utah Children's Choice Honors Award in 1983,<ref>[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/664/Apple-Margot-1946.html Children's Choice Honors Award], \"Utah Children's Choice, 1983, for The Chocolate Touch\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref> and the Beehive Award<ref>[http://mtpleasantlib.org/children/book-lists/the-utah-beehive-awards/ The Utah Beehive Awards], \"Utah Children's Fiction Book Award - The Chocolate Touch By Patrick Catling (1983)\", accessed 01-21-2009</ref> from the Children's Literature Association of Utah in 1983.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Portal|Children's literature}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chocolate Touch, The}}\n[[Category:1952 American novels]]\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:Chocolate]]\n[[Category:Greco-Roman mythology in popular culture]]\n[[Category:1952 children's books]]\n", "name_user": "108.24.148.169", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ememes)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chocolate_Touch"}

Usually, though not necessarily (see Demarchy), this means voting.  Significant in most vote-based democracies are political parties: groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties will have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems. \n \n''Note: These categories are not exclusive.''\n\nMany democracies are vulnerable to various forms of abuse, which may transform the government into an autocracy or oligarchy. Most autocracies or oligarchies still call themselves democracies.

These groups, sometimes termed \"policy juries\", \"citizens' juries\", or \"consensus conferences\", deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that [[jury|juries]] decide criminal cases. Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional [[representative democracy]], which is widely subject to manipulation by [[special interests]] and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. According to Australian philosopher [[John Burnheim]], random selection of policymakers would make it easier for everyday citizens to meaningfully participate, and harder for special interests to corrupt the process.\n\nMore generally, random selection of decision makers from a larger group is known as [[sortition]] (from the Latin base for lottery). The [[Athenian democracy]] made much use of sortition, with nearly all government offices filled by lottery (of full citizens) rather than by election. Candidates were almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of wealth and status.\n|\n* Ancient Athens<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian democracy in the age of Demosthenes : structure, principles, and ideology|last=Hansen, Mogens Herman, 1940-|date=1999|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|isbn=1853995851|edition=[2nd ed.]|location=[Bristol]|oclc=45392658}}</ref>\n* Northern Italy and Venice (12th\u201318th century)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The political potential of sortition a study of the random selection of citizens for public office / Oliver Dowlen.|last=Dowlen, Oliver, 1953-|date=2008|publisher=Exeter, UK ; Charlottesville, VA|isbn=9781845401795|oclc=213307148}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Direct democracy]] || Variant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves and vote directly for new laws and public policy.\n|{{Flagicon image|Flag of Switzerland.svg}} [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of {{Flagicon image|Flag of Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden.svg}} [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and {{Flagicon image|Flag of Canton of Glarus.svg}} [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]\n|-\n|[[Electocracy]]|| Variant of democracy; a form of representative democracy where citizens are able to vote for their government but cannot participate directly in governmental decision making and where the government does not share any power almost as the government has absolute power\n|\n*{{Flagicon|Iraq}} [[Iraq]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/09/05/hypocrisy_in_sowing_democracy/|title=Hypocrisy in sowing democracy|last=Greenway|first=H.

It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [[election]]s between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[Political party|political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], and the protection of [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either formally written or [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[republic]], such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], or the [[United States]]; or a [[constitutional monarchy]], such as [[Japan]] or [[Spain]]. It may have a [[presidential system]] ([[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], or the [[United States]]), a [[semi-presidential system]] ([[France]], or [[Portugal]]), or a [[parliamentary system]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[India]], [[Italy]], or [[New Zealand]]).\n|\n*{{Flagicon|India}} [[India]]\n*{{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Germany]]\n*{{Flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[United Kingdom]]\n*{{Flagicon|Indonesia}} [[Indonesia]]\n|-\n|[[Liquid democracy]]  ||\nVariant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves or choose to temporarily delegate their vote to another voter to vote for new laws and public policy.\n|Experiments have mostly been conducted on a local-level or exclusively through online platforms\n|-\n| [[Representative democracy]] || Variant of democracy; wherein the people or citizens of a country elect representatives to create and implement public policy in place of active participation by the people.\n|Almost all democratic systems\n|-\n| [[Social democracy]] || Variant of democracy; social democracy rejects the \"either/or\" phobiocratic/polarization interpretation of capitalism versus socialism. Social democracy argues that all citizens should be legally entitled to certain social rights. These are made up of universal access to public services such as: education, health care, workers' compensation, public transportation, and other services including child care and care for the elderly. Social democracy is connected with the trade union labour movement and supports collective bargaining rights for workers. Contemporary social democracy advocates freedom from discrimination based on differences of: ability/disability, age, ethnicity, sex, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and social class.\n|\n*{{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Germany]]\n*{{Flagicon|Austria}} [[Austria]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbuch der \u00f6sterreichischen Wirtschaftspolitik|last=Abele|first=Hanns|publisher=Manz|others=|year=1982|isbn=3214070509|location=Wien|page=145|oclc=10694901}}</ref>\n*{{Flagicon|Sweden}} [[Sweden]]\n*{{Flagicon|Norway}} [[Norway]]\n*{{Flagicon|Denmark}} [[Denmark]]\n*{{Flagicon|Finland}} [[Finland]]\n*{{Flagicon|Iceland}} [[Iceland]]\n|-\n| [[Soviet democracy]] || Variant of democracy; The citizens are governing by directly elected councils.

These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.\n\nSome historical examples of oligarchy are the [[Roman Republic]], in which only males of the nobility could run for office and only wealthy males could vote, and the [[Athenian democracy]], which used [[sortition]] to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status.

A portmanteau of Internet and aristocracy, netocracy refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a bourgeoisie of a gradually diminishing importance. The netocracy concept has been compared with [[Richard Florida]]'s concept of the [[creative class]]. Bard and S\u00f6derqvist have also defined an under-class in opposition to the [[netocracy]], which they refer to as the consumitariat.\n|-\n|[[Noocracy]]\n|Rule by the wise; a system of governance in which decision making is in the hands of philosophers. (advocated by [[Plato]])\n|-\n| [[Plutocracy]] || Rule by the wealthy; a system wherein governance is indebted to, dependent upon or heavily influenced by the desires of the rich. Plutocratic influence can alter any form of government. For instance, in a republic, if a significant number of elected representative positions are dependent upon financial support from wealthy sources, it is a plutocratic republic.\n|-\n|[[Particracy]]\n|Rule by a dominant [[political party]] (or parties).\n|-\n|[[Stratocracy]]\n|Rule by military service; a system of governance composed of military government in which the state and the military are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity. Citizens with mandatory or voluntary active military service or who have been honorably discharged have the right to govern. (Therefore, stratocracy is not to be confused with \"[[military junta]]\" or \"[[military dictatorship]]\".) The [[Sparta]]n [[city-state]] is a historical example; its social system and constitution were completely focused on military training and excellence. Stratocratic ideology often attaches to the honor-oriented [[timocracy]].\n|-\n| [[Technocracy]] || Rule by the educated or technical experts; a system of governance where people who are skilled or proficient govern in their respective areas of expertise in technology would be in control of all decision making. Doctors, engineers, scientists, professionals and technologists who have knowledge, expertise, or skills would compose the governing body instead of politicians, businessmen and economists.<ref>Ernst R.

[[Holy See|The Vatican]]'s (see [[Pope]]), [[Iran]]'s (see [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]), [[Caliphate]]s and other [[Islamic state]]s are historically considered ''theocracies''.\n|-\n| [[Timocracy]] || Rule by the [[honour]]able; a system of governance ruled by honorable citizens and property owners. [[Socrates]] defines a timocracy as a government ruled by people who love honour and are selected according to the degree of honour they hold in society. This form of timocracy is very similar to [[meritocracy]], in the sense that individuals of outstanding character or faculty are placed in the seat of power.\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Types of autocracy ===\n[[Autocracy|Autocracies]] are ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in a [[dictatorship]] or it may be a group, as in a [[one-party state]]. The word [[despotism]] means to \"rule in the fashion of despots\" and is often used to describe autocracy.\n\nHistorical examples of autocracy include the [[Roman Empire]], [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Dictatorship|Civilian Dictatorship]] || A dictatorship where power resides in the hands of one single person or [[polity]].

The [[Roman Republic]] made dictators to lead during times of war; but the Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, an autocrat's rule is one that not stopped by any rules of law, [[constitution]]s, or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by autocratic governments. Examples of dictators include: [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]].\n|-\n| [[Military dictatorship|Military Dictatorship]] ||A dictatorship primarily enforced by the military. Military dictators are different from [[Civilian dictatorship|civilian dictators]] for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule, and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as \u201cneutral\u201d arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many juntas adopt titles, such as \u201cNational Redemption Council\", \u201cCommittee of National Restoration\", or \u201cNational Liberation Committee\". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of them as the head. \n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pejorative attributes ===\nRegardless of the form of government, the actual governance may be influenced by sectors with [[Power (social and political)|political power]] which are not part of the formal government.

A constitution is normally used so the people of that government has civil and ethical rights. \n|-\n|[[Monarchy]]\n|A monarchy is a [[form of government]] in which a group, generally a family representing a [[dynasty]], embodies the country's [[national identity]] and its head, the [[monarch]], exercises the role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic ([[crowned republic]]), to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]), to completely autocratic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally the monarch's post is [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] and lasts until death or abdication. In contrast, [[Elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] require the monarch to be elected. Both types have further variations as there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. For example, in some<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Avoid weasel words|which?]]'']</sup>elected monarchies only pedigrees are taken into account for eligibility of the next ruler, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, etc. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] is subject to effective election. There have been cases where the term of a monarch's [[reign]] is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance.\n|-\n|[[Republic]]\n|A republic ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''[[res publica]]'') is a [[form of government]] in which the country is considered a \"public matter\", not the [[Res privata|private concern or property]] of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are not inherited, but are attained through elections expressing the [[consent of the governed]]. Such leadership positions are therefore expected to fairly represent the citizen body. It is a form of government under which the head of state is not a [[monarch]]. In American English, the definition of a republic can also refer specifically to a government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body, also known as a [[representative democracy]] (a [[democratic republic]]) and exercise power according to the [[rule of law]] (a [[Constitutionalism|constitutional]] republic).\n|}\n\n==== Types of monarchy ====\nCountries with [[monarchy]] attributes are those where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the [[wikt:Special:Search/royalty|royalty]], represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical ([[crowned republic]]) to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]) to completely despotic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is [[inheritance|inherited]], but there are also [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] where the monarch is elected.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Absolute monarchy]] || A traditional and historical system where the monarch exercises ultimate governing authority as [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].

Under feudalism, all the land in a kingdom belonged to the king. However, the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him. These presents of land were called manors. Then the nobles gave some of their land to vassals. The vassals then had to do duties for the nobles. The lands of vassals were called fiefs.\nA similar system is the [[Iqta]], used by medieval [[Islamic]] societies of the middle east and north Africa. This functioned much like the feudal system but generally had titles that weren't granted to a family dynasty but to individuals at the behest of the sultan and generally only required a tax from the lower classes, instead of military service and/or manual labour like in the feudal system.\n|-\n|[[Minarchism]]\n|A variant of [[capitalism]] which advocates for the [[State (polity)|State]] to exist solely to provide a very small number of services. A popular model of the State proposed by minarchists is known as the [[night-watchman state]], in which the only governmental functions are to protect citizens from [[aggression]], [[theft]], [[breach of contract]], and [[fraud]] as defined by [[property law]]s, limiting it to three institutions: the [[military]], the [[police]], and [[courts]].\n|-\n|[[Monarchism]]\n|A system in which the government is headed by an agreed upon head of the [[nobility]] who is known as the [[monarch]], usually in the form of a [[king]] or [[emperor]] (but also less commonly a [[Queen regnant|queen]] or empress). In most monarchical systems the position of monarch is one [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] from a previous ruler by [[Heredity|bloodline]] or marriage, but in other cases it may be a position elected by the [[nobility]] themselves, as was the case in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]] and the medieval [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n|-\n|[[Republicanism]]\n|A system in which the laws and governmental policies of the state are considered a \"public matter\" and decided by the citizens of the society, whoever they may be.

This is the same thing as a [[Federation|federal government]] which may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its member states, though the adjective 'central' is sometimes used to describe it. The structure of central governments varies. Many countries have created autonomous regions by delegating powers from the central government to governments at a sub national level, such as a regional, state or local level. Based on a broad definition of a basic political system, there are two or more levels of government that exist within an established territory and govern through common institutions with overlapping or shared powers as prescribed by a [[constitution]] or other law.\n|-\n|[[City-state|City-State]]\n|A [[sovereign state]], also described as a type of small independent country, that usually consists of a single city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as [[Rome]], [[Athens]], [[Carthage]], and the [[Italian city-states]] during the [[Renaissance]]. Today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies currently to [[Singapore]], [[Monaco]], and [[Vatican City]].

Usually, though not necessarily (see Demarchy), this means voting.  Significant in most vote-based democracies are political parties: groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties will have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems. \n \n''Note: These categories are not exclusive.''\n\nMany democracies are vulnerable to various forms of abuse, which may transform the government into an autocracy or oligarchy. Most autocracies or oligarchies still call themselves democracies.

These groups, sometimes termed \"policy juries\", \"citizens' juries\", or \"consensus conferences\", deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that [[jury|juries]] decide criminal cases. Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional [[representative democracy]], which is widely subject to manipulation by [[special interests]] and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. According to Australian philosopher [[John Burnheim]], random selection of policymakers would make it easier for everyday citizens to meaningfully participate, and harder for special interests to corrupt the process.\n\nMore generally, random selection of decision makers from a larger group is known as [[sortition]] (from the Latin base for lottery). The [[Athenian democracy]] made much use of sortition, with nearly all government offices filled by lottery (of full citizens) rather than by election. Candidates were almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of wealth and status.\n|\n* Ancient Athens<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian democracy in the age of Demosthenes : structure, principles, and ideology|last=Hansen, Mogens Herman, 1940-|date=1999|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|isbn=1853995851|edition=[2nd ed.]|location=[Bristol]|oclc=45392658}}</ref>\n* Northern Italy and Venice (12th\u201318th century)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The political potential of sortition a study of the random selection of citizens for public office / Oliver Dowlen.|last=Dowlen, Oliver, 1953-|date=2008|publisher=Exeter, UK ; Charlottesville, VA|isbn=9781845401795|oclc=213307148}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Direct democracy]] || Variant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves and vote directly for new laws and public policy.\n|{{Flagicon image|Flag of Switzerland.svg}} [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of {{Flagicon image|Flag of Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden.svg}} [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and {{Flagicon image|Flag of Canton of Glarus.svg}} [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]\n|-\n|[[Electocracy]]|| Variant of democracy; a form of representative democracy where citizens are able to vote for their government but cannot participate directly in governmental decision making and where the government does not share any power almost as the government has absolute power\n|\n*{{Flagicon|Iraq}} [[Iraq]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/09/05/hypocrisy_in_sowing_democracy/|title=Hypocrisy in sowing democracy|last=Greenway|first=H.

It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [[election]]s between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[Political party|political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], and the protection of [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either formally written or [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[republic]], such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], or the [[United States]]; or a [[constitutional monarchy]], such as [[Japan]] or [[Spain]]. It may have a [[presidential system]] ([[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], or the [[United States]]), a [[semi-presidential system]] ([[France]], or [[Portugal]]), or a [[parliamentary system]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[India]], [[Italy]], or [[New Zealand]]).\n|\n*{{Flagicon|India}} [[India]]\n*{{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Germany]]\n*{{Flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[United Kingdom]]\n*{{Flagicon|Indonesia}} [[Indonesia]]\n|-\n|[[Liquid democracy]]  ||\nVariant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves or choose to temporarily delegate their vote to another voter to vote for new laws and public policy.\n|Experiments have mostly been conducted on a local-level or exclusively through online platforms\n|-\n| [[Representative democracy]] || Variant of democracy; wherein the people or citizens of a country elect representatives to create and implement public policy in place of active participation by the people.\n|Almost all democratic systems\n|-\n| [[Social democracy]] || Variant of democracy; social democracy rejects the \"either/or\" phobiocratic/polarization interpretation of capitalism versus socialism. Social democracy argues that all citizens should be legally entitled to certain social rights. These are made up of universal access to public services such as: education, health care, workers' compensation, public transportation, and other services including child care and care for the elderly. Social democracy is connected with the trade union labour movement and supports collective bargaining rights for workers. Contemporary social democracy advocates freedom from discrimination based on differences of: ability/disability, age, ethnicity, sex, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and social class.\n|\n*{{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Germany]]\n*{{Flagicon|Austria}} [[Austria]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbuch der \u00f6sterreichischen Wirtschaftspolitik|last=Abele|first=Hanns|publisher=Manz|others=|year=1982|isbn=3214070509|location=Wien|page=145|oclc=10694901}}</ref>\n*{{Flagicon|Sweden}} [[Sweden]]\n*{{Flagicon|Norway}} [[Norway]]\n*{{Flagicon|Denmark}} [[Denmark]]\n*{{Flagicon|Finland}} [[Finland]]\n*{{Flagicon|Iceland}} [[Iceland]]\n|-\n| [[Soviet democracy]] || Variant of democracy; The citizens are governing by directly elected councils.

These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.\n\nSome historical examples of oligarchy are the [[Roman Republic]], in which only males of the nobility could run for office and only wealthy males could vote, and the [[Athenian democracy]], which used [[sortition]] to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status.

A portmanteau of Internet and aristocracy, netocracy refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a bourgeoisie of a gradually diminishing importance. The netocracy concept has been compared with [[Richard Florida]]'s concept of the [[creative class]]. Bard and S\u00f6derqvist have also defined an under-class in opposition to the [[netocracy]], which they refer to as the consumitariat.\n|-\n|[[Noocracy]]\n|Rule by the wise; a system of governance in which decision making is in the hands of philosophers. (advocated by [[Plato]])\n|-\n| [[Plutocracy]] || Rule by the wealthy; a system wherein governance is indebted to, dependent upon or heavily influenced by the desires of the rich. Plutocratic influence can alter any form of government. For instance, in a republic, if a significant number of elected representative positions are dependent upon financial support from wealthy sources, it is a plutocratic republic.\n|-\n|[[Particracy]]\n|Rule by a dominant [[political party]] (or parties).\n|-\n|[[Stratocracy]]\n|Rule by military service; a system of governance composed of military government in which the state and the military are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity. Citizens with mandatory or voluntary active military service or who have been honorably discharged have the right to govern. (Therefore, stratocracy is not to be confused with \"[[military junta]]\" or \"[[military dictatorship]]\".) The [[Sparta]]n [[city-state]] is a historical example; its social system and constitution were completely focused on military training and excellence. Stratocratic ideology often attaches to the honor-oriented [[timocracy]].\n|-\n| [[Technocracy]] || Rule by the educated or technical experts; a system of governance where people who are skilled or proficient govern in their respective areas of expertise in technology would be in control of all decision making. Doctors, engineers, scientists, professionals and technologists who have knowledge, expertise, or skills would compose the governing body instead of politicians, businessmen and economists.<ref>Ernst R.

[[Holy See|The Vatican]]'s (see [[Pope]]), [[Iran]]'s (see [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]), [[Caliphate]]s and other [[Islamic state]]s are historically considered ''theocracies''.\n|-\n| [[Timocracy]] || Rule by the [[honour]]able; a system of governance ruled by honorable citizens and property owners. [[Socrates]] defines a timocracy as a government ruled by people who love honour and are selected according to the degree of honour they hold in society. This form of timocracy is very similar to [[meritocracy]], in the sense that individuals of outstanding character or faculty are placed in the seat of power.\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Types of autocracy ===\n[[Autocracy|Autocracies]] are ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in a [[dictatorship]] or it may be a group, as in a [[one-party state]]. The word [[despotism]] means to \"rule in the fashion of despots\" and is often used to describe autocracy.\n\nHistorical examples of autocracy include the [[Roman Empire]], [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Dictatorship|Civilian Dictatorship]] || A dictatorship where power resides in the hands of one single person or [[polity]].

The [[Roman Republic]] made dictators to lead during times of war; but the Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, an autocrat's rule is one that not stopped by any rules of law, [[constitution]]s, or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by autocratic governments. Examples of dictators include: [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]].\n|-\n| [[Military dictatorship|Military Dictatorship]] ||A dictatorship primarily enforced by the military. Military dictators are different from [[Civilian dictatorship|civilian dictators]] for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule, and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as \u201cneutral\u201d arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many juntas adopt titles, such as \u201cNational Redemption Council\", \u201cCommittee of National Restoration\", or \u201cNational Liberation Committee\". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of them as the head. \n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pejorative attributes ===\nRegardless of the form of government, the actual governance may be influenced by sectors with [[Power (social and political)|political power]] which are not part of the formal government.

A constitution is normally used so the people of that government has civil and ethical rights. \n|-\n|[[Monarchy]]\n|A monarchy is a [[form of government]] in which a group, generally a family representing a [[dynasty]], embodies the country's [[national identity]] and its head, the [[monarch]], exercises the role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic ([[crowned republic]]), to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]), to completely autocratic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally the monarch's post is [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] and lasts until death or abdication. In contrast, [[Elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] require the monarch to be elected. Both types have further variations as there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. For example, in some<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Avoid weasel words|which?]]'']</sup>elected monarchies only pedigrees are taken into account for eligibility of the next ruler, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, etc. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] is subject to effective election. There have been cases where the term of a monarch's [[reign]] is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance.\n|-\n|[[Republic]]\n|A republic ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''[[res publica]]'') is a [[form of government]] in which the country is considered a \"public matter\", not the [[Res privata|private concern or property]] of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are not inherited, but are attained through elections expressing the [[consent of the governed]]. Such leadership positions are therefore expected to fairly represent the citizen body. It is a form of government under which the head of state is not a [[monarch]]. In American English, the definition of a republic can also refer specifically to a government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body, also known as a [[representative democracy]] (a [[democratic republic]]) and exercise power according to the [[rule of law]] (a [[Constitutionalism|constitutional]] republic).\n|}\n\n==== Types of monarchy ====\nCountries with [[monarchy]] attributes are those where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the [[wikt:Special:Search/royalty|royalty]], represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical ([[crowned republic]]) to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]) to completely despotic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is [[inheritance|inherited]], but there are also [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] where the monarch is elected.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Absolute monarchy]] || A traditional and historical system where the monarch exercises ultimate governing authority as [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].

Typically, laws cannot be passed which violate said constitution, unless the constitution itself is altered by law. This theoretically serves to protect minority groups from being subjected to the [[tyranny of the majority]], or [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]]. Examples include the [[United States]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], etc.\n|-\n| [[Democratic republic]] || Republics where the laws are ultimately decided by popular vote, whether by a body of elected representatives or directly by the public, and there is no restriction on which laws are passed so long as they have majority support. Constitutional law is either non-existent or poses little obstacle to legislation.\n|-\n| [[Federal republic]] || Republics that are a federation of states or provinces, where there is a national (federal) law encompassing the nation as a whole but where each state or province is free to legislate and enforce its own laws and affairs so long as they don't conflict with federal law. Examples include [[United States]], [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Brazil]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], and [[Switzerland]].\n|-\n| [[Islamic republic]] || Republics governed in accordance with Islamic law. Examples include [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Pakistan]].\n|-\n| [[Parliamentary republic]] || Republics, like [[Germany]], [[India]] or [[Singapore]], with an elected head of state, but where the head of state and head of government are kept separate with the head of government retaining most executive powers, or a head of state akin to a head of government, elected by a parliament.\n|-\n|[[Presidential system|Presidential Republic]]\n|Republics with an elected head of state, where the head of state is also the head of the government.

These are often described as [[Stateless society|stateless societies]], although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] or [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]], while others have advocated for stateless societies with the inclusion of [[Anarcho-Capitalism|private property]], property rights and hierarchical groups, so long as membership and association with those groups are entirely [[Voluntaryism|voluntary]]. Anarchism holds the [[State (polity)|state]] to be undesirable, unnecessary and/or harmful.\n|-\n| [[Capitalism]] || A system in which the [[means of production]] (machines, tools, factories, etc.) are owned by private individuals, workers then negotiate with those individuals to use those means of production in exchange for a portion of what they produce, usually in the form of capital ([[money]]).

Under feudalism, all the land in a kingdom belonged to the king. However, the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him. These presents of land were called manors. Then the nobles gave some of their land to vassals. The vassals then had to do duties for the nobles. The lands of vassals were called fiefs.\nA similar system is the [[Iqta]], used by medieval [[Islamic]] societies of the middle east and north Africa. This functioned much like the feudal system but generally had titles that weren't granted to a family dynasty but to individuals at the behest of the sultan and generally only required a tax from the lower classes, instead of military service and/or manual labour like in the feudal system.\n|-\n|[[Minarchism]]\n|A variant of [[capitalism]] which advocates for the [[State (polity)|State]] to exist solely to provide a very small number of services. A popular model of the State proposed by minarchists is known as the [[night-watchman state]], in which the only governmental functions are to protect citizens from [[aggression]], [[theft]], [[breach of contract]], and [[fraud]] as defined by [[property law]]s, limiting it to three institutions: the [[military]], the [[police]], and [[courts]].\n|-\n|[[Monarchism]]\n|A system in which the government is headed by an agreed upon head of the [[nobility]] who is known as the [[monarch]], usually in the form of a [[king]] or [[emperor]] (but also less commonly a [[Queen regnant|queen]] or empress). In most monarchical systems the position of monarch is one [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] from a previous ruler by [[Heredity|bloodline]] or marriage, but in other cases it may be a position elected by the [[nobility]] themselves, as was the case in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]] and the medieval [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n|-\n|[[Republicanism]]\n|A system in which the laws and governmental policies of the state are considered a \"public matter\" and decided by the citizens of the society, whoever they may be.

This is the same thing as a [[Federation|federal government]] which may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its member states, though the adjective 'central' is sometimes used to describe it. The structure of central governments varies. Many countries have created autonomous regions by delegating powers from the central government to governments at a sub national level, such as a regional, state or local level. Based on a broad definition of a basic political system, there are two or more levels of government that exist within an established territory and govern through common institutions with overlapping or shared powers as prescribed by a [[constitution]] or other law.\n|-\n|[[City-state|City-State]]\n|A [[sovereign state]], also described as a type of small independent country, that usually consists of a single city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as [[Rome]], [[Athens]], [[Carthage]], and the [[Italian city-states]] during the [[Renaissance]]. Today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies currently to [[Singapore]], [[Monaco]], and [[Vatican City]]. City states are also sometimes called [[micro-state]]s which however also includes other configurations of very small countries.\n|-\n|[[Commune]]\n|From the [[Medieval Latin]] ''[[communia]].''

Although corporate republics do not exist officially in the modern world, they are often used in works of fiction or [[political criticism|political commentary]] as a warning of the perceived dangers of unbridled [[capitalism]]. In such works, they usually arise when a single, vastly powerful corporation deposes a weak government, over time or in a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].\n\nSome political scientists have also considered [[state socialist]] nations to be forms of corporate republics, with the state assuming full control of all economic and political life and establishing a monopoly on everything within national boundaries \u2013 effectively making the state itself amount to a giant corporation.\n|-\n|[[Cyberocracy]] || Theoretical [[form of government]] that rules by the effective use of information\n|-|-\n|Magocracy || Rule by a government with the highest and main authority being either a [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]], sage, sorcerer, wizard, witch, or some other magic user.

It was published weekly as well.\n\nIn 1862, Toronto newspaperman and [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[James Innes (Canadian politician)|James Innes]] took over the editorship of the ''Guelph Advertiser'' and shortly thereafter formed a partnership with [[John McLagan]], owner of the competing weekly newspaper the ''Guelph Mercury''.\n\nThe two papers merged to form the ''Mercury and Advertiser''. ''The Mercury'' was expanded into a daily newspaper in 1867. Among its editors was the future best-selling novelist [[Thomas B. Costain]] who worked there from 1908 to 1910. ''The Guelph Mercury'' has since had numerous owners. Innes sold his share in the newspaper in 1905 to J. Innes McIntosh, who also bought the ''Guelph Herald'', a competing daily newspaper, in 1924. McIntosh then sold his share in 1929 to James Playfair, who sold the paper in the late 1940s to [[Thomson Corporation|Thomson Newspapers]]. Thomson remained owner for half a century, until [[Hollinger Inc.]] purchased the paper in 1995. [[Sun Media]] purchased the paper in 1998 and then resold it to [[Torstar]].\n\n''The Guelph Mercury'' was then published six days a week by [[Metroland Media Group]], a subsidiary of Torstar Corporation. The newspaper also published a free weekly roundup for some time as well as various other special publications. A magazine, ''Guelph Life'', was cancelled as a cost-cutting measure in 2009 but restored in 2015; it continued after the ''Guelph Mercury'' ceased publication in early 2016. The Mercury was one of few Metroland newspapers still to have their own presses since the Mercury's sister paper, the ''[[Waterloo Region Record]]'', is printed at another Torstar site, ''The Hamilton Spectator'' in Hamilton, Ontario.

It published a mix of community, national and international news and is owned by the [[Torstar|Torstar Corporation]]. The newspaper, in many incarnations, was a part of the community since 1854. It was one of the oldest broadsheet newspapers in Ontario.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/guelph-mercury-stops-publishing-print-edition-1.3418609 |title=Guelph Mercury stops publishing print edition, all staff cut  |last=Grant |first=Amanda |date=January 25, 2016 |website=CBC News |publisher=CBC/Radio Canada |access-date=January 26, 2016}}</ref> Publication was discontinued in late January 2016.\n\n== History ==\nThe ''Wellington Mercury'' was founded in 1853, and published weekly by owner George Keeling.\n\nA competing paper was started in 1854, named the ''Guelph Advertiser''. It was published weekly as well.\n\nIn 1862, Toronto newspaperman and [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[James Innes (Canadian politician)|James Innes]] took over the editorship of the ''Guelph Advertiser'' and shortly thereafter formed a partnership with [[John McLagan]], owner of the competing weekly newspaper the ''Guelph Mercury''.\n\nThe two papers merged to form the ''Mercury and Advertiser''. ''The Mercury'' was expanded into a daily newspaper in 1867. Among its editors was the future best-selling novelist [[Thomas B. Costain]] who worked there from 1908 to 1910. ''The Guelph Mercury'' has since had numerous owners. Innes sold his share in the newspaper in 1905 to J. Innes McIntosh, who also bought the ''Guelph Herald'', a competing daily newspaper, in 1924. McIntosh then sold his share in 1929 to James Playfair, who sold the paper in the late 1940s to [[Thomson Corporation|Thomson Newspapers]]. Thomson remained owner for half a century, until [[Hollinger Inc.]] purchased the paper in 1995. [[Sun Media]] purchased the paper in 1998 and then resold it to [[Torstar]].\n\n''The Guelph Mercury'' was then published six days a week by [[Metroland Media Group]], a subsidiary of Torstar Corporation. The newspaper also published a free weekly roundup for some time as well as various other special publications. A magazine, ''Guelph Life'', was cancelled as a cost-cutting measure in 2009 but restored in 2015; it continued after the ''Guelph Mercury'' ceased publication in early 2016. The Mercury was one of few Metroland newspapers still to have their own presses since the Mercury's sister paper, the ''[[Waterloo Region Record]]'', is printed at another Torstar site, ''The Hamilton Spectator'' in Hamilton, Ontario. In February 2009, Torstar announced layoffs across the chain, including 13 newsroom staff at the ''Guelph Mercury''. According to the announcement, copy editing and page production of the paper will be transferred to the ''Waterloo Region Record'', reducing the editorial staff of the paper to two managers and eight reporter\u2013photographers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.guelphmercury.com/News/BreakingNews/article/444110 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413210401/http://news.guelphmercury.com/News/BreakingNews/article/444110 |archive-date=2009-04-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Both the ''[[Guelph Tribune]]'' and ''Guelph Mercury'' are owned and published by Metroland Media Group but keep separate newsrooms and operations.

However, a fight occured, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits had disappeared and then, a wall of mist had trapped everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Luckily, young Agnarr had escaped due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]], enjoying every exotic experience. However, one night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Rock Troll colony arrive at Arendelle, and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldran who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf, and Anna accepts Kristoff's marriage proposal. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits.

It had the [[List of highest-grossing openings for animated films|highest all-time worldwide opening for an animated film]] and went on to gross $1.45 billion worldwide, making it the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|third highest-grossing film of 2019]], the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|second highest-grossing animated film of all time]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|10th highest-grossing film of all time]]. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, winning two [[Annie Awards]] for Outstanding Achievement for Animated Effects in an Animated Production and Outstanding Achievement for Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production and a [[Visual Effects Society Award]] for Outstanding Effects Simulations in an Animated Feature. At the [[92nd Academy Awards]], the film received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Into the Unknown (Disney song)|Into the Unknown]]\".\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words, according to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, so please do not expand this section too much and do not include unnecessary details. -->\nThe story starts with King Agnarr of Arendelle telling a story to his young children, [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]] and [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], about their grandfather, King Runeard, who had established a treaty with the neighboring tribe of Northuldra by building a dam in their homeland, the Enchanted Forest. However, a fight occured, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits had disappeared and then, a wall of mist had trapped everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Luckily, young Agnarr had escaped due to the help of an unknown savior!\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]], enjoying every exotic experience. However, one night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Rock Troll colony arrive at Arendelle, and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldran who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf, and Anna accepts Kristoff's marriage proposal. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.
