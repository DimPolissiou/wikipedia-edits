Much of their wealth, however, was wasted fighting each other. Up until the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] completed the colonization of Maluku in the 19th century, the sultans of Ternate ruled empires that claimed at least nominal influence as far as [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]].<ref name=\"travel\">{{cite book | last =Witton | first =Patrick | title =Indonesia | publisher =Lonely Planet | year =2003 | location =Melbourne | pages =821\u2013822 | isbn=1-74059-154-2 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Concise History of Islam|last=Syed|first=Muzaffar Husain|last2=Akhtar|first2=Syed Saud|last3=Usmani|first3=B D|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|year=2011|isbn=9789382573470|location=|pages=332|oclc=868069299}}</ref>\n\nThe peak of its power came near the end of the sixteenth century, under Sultan [[Babullah of Ternate|Baabullah]], when it had influence over most of the eastern part of Sulawesi, the Ambon and [[Seram]] area, and parts of Papua. It engaged in fierce competition for control of its periphery with the nearby sultanate of Tidore.

Particularly under Sultan [[Hamza of Ternate|Hamzah]] (r. 1627\u20131648), Ternate expanded its territory and strengthened its control over the periphery. Dutch influence over the kingdom was limited, though Hamzah and his son and successor, Sultan [[Mandar Syah]] (r. 1648\u20131675) did concede some regions to the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in exchange for help controlling rebellions there.

Casumpang (Page 3)</ref> In the Philippines, they settled in ([[Ermita]], Manila), (San Roque, Cavite), ([[Tanza, Cavite]]) and ([[Ternate, Cavite]]) which they named after their homeland. However, there are still remnants of these mixed Mexican-Filipino-Spanish and Papuan-Indonesian-Portuguese people who elected to stay in Ternate, Indonesia but they were persecuted by a resurgent Islamicizing [[Sultanate of Ternate]]. In the 18th century Ternate was the site of a VOC governorship, which attempted to control all trade in the northern Moluccas.\n\nBy the 19th century, the spice trade had declined substantially. Hence the region was less central to the Netherlands colonial state, but the Dutch maintained a presence in the region in order to prevent another colonial power from occupying it. After the VOC was [[Nationalization|nationalised]] by the Dutch government in 1800, Ternate became part of the Government of the Moluccas (''Gouvernement der Molukken''). Ternate was [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|captured and occupied]] by [[British Empire|British]] forces in 1810 before being returned to Dutch control in 1817. In 1824 became the capital of a residency (administrative region) covering Halmahera, the entire west coast of [[New Guinea]], and the central east coast of [[Sulawesi]]. By 1867 all of Dutch-occupied [[New Guinea]] had been added to the residency, but then its region was gradually transferred to Ambon (Amboina) before being dissolved into that residency in 1922.\n\n===The \"Ternate Essay\"===\n[[File:Moluccan Beetles from Malay Archipelago 1869.jpg|thumb|\"Moluccan Beetles\" from [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', 1869]]\nIn 1858 [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] wrote his paper on [[evolution]] here, which he sent to [[Charles Darwin]] for his attention.<ref name=\"Wallace\">{{cite web | url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S043.htm | title=On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type | publisher=Charles Smith (WKU.edu) | date=1858 | accessdate=22 April 2013 | author=Wallace, Alfred Russel}}</ref> Contrary to popular belief, Wallace had not published a paper on evolution before 1858, nor had he intended the \"Ternate Essay\" to be published in the form in which he sent it to Darwin.<ref name=\"Wallace\" />\n\nThe essay was titled \"On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type\", and in its nine pages it concisely describes the theory of evolution by [[natural selection]].

Particularly under Sultan [[Hamza of Ternate|Hamzah]] (r. 1627\u20131648), Ternate expanded its territory and strengthened its control over the periphery. Dutch influence over the kingdom was limited, though Hamzah and his son and successor, Sultan [[Mandar Syah]] (r. 1648\u20131675) did concede some regions to the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in exchange for help controlling rebellions there. The Spaniards abandoned Ternate and Tidore in 1663. When they abandoned Ternate, some of the people accompanied the Spanish in their retreat to the Philippines. About 200 families of Mixed Mexican-Filipino-Spanish and Papuan-Indonesian-Portuguese descent left Ternate and settled in the Philippines.<ref>Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano: Philippine Spanish Creole or Filipinized Spanish Creole? By Tyron Judes D. Casumpang (Page 3)</ref> In the Philippines, they settled in ([[Ermita]], Manila), (San Roque, Cavite), ([[Tanza, Cavite]]) and ([[Ternate, Cavite]]) which they named after their homeland. However, there are still remnants of these mixed Mexican-Filipino-Spanish and Papuan-Indonesian-Portuguese people who elected to stay in Ternate, Indonesia but they were persecuted by a resurgent Islamicizing [[Sultanate of Ternate]]. In the 18th century Ternate was the site of a VOC governorship, which attempted to control all trade in the northern Moluccas.\n\nBy the 19th century, the spice trade had declined substantially. Hence the region was less central to the Netherlands colonial state, but the Dutch maintained a presence in the region in order to prevent another colonial power from occupying it. After the VOC was [[Nationalization|nationalised]] by the Dutch government in 1800, Ternate became part of the Government of the Moluccas (''Gouvernement der Molukken''). Ternate was [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|captured and occupied]] by [[British Empire|British]] forces in 1810 before being returned to Dutch control in 1817. In 1824 became the capital of a residency (administrative region) covering Halmahera, the entire west coast of [[New Guinea]], and the central east coast of [[Sulawesi]]. By 1867 all of Dutch-occupied [[New Guinea]] had been added to the residency, but then its region was gradually transferred to Ambon (Amboina) before being dissolved into that residency in 1922.\n\n===The \"Ternate Essay\"===\n[[File:Moluccan Beetles from Malay Archipelago 1869.jpg|thumb|\"Moluccan Beetles\" from [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', 1869]]\nIn 1858 [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] wrote his paper on [[evolution]] here, which he sent to [[Charles Darwin]] for his attention.<ref name=\"Wallace\">{{cite web | url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S043.htm | title=On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type | publisher=Charles Smith (WKU.edu) | date=1858 | accessdate=22 April 2013 | author=Wallace, Alfred Russel}}</ref> Contrary to popular belief, Wallace had not published a paper on evolution before 1858, nor had he intended the \"Ternate Essay\" to be published in the form in which he sent it to Darwin.<ref name=\"Wallace\" />\n\nThe essay was titled \"On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type\", and in its nine pages it concisely describes the theory of evolution by [[natural selection]].

[[P-Funk]] keyboardist/architect [[Bernie Worrell]] briefly joined the group in 1968 while attending the [[New England Conservatory of Music]]. Future [[Aerosmith]] drummer [[Joey Kramer]] appeared as the \"token white-guy drummer\" in a later incarnation called ''The Turnpikes'' from the fall of 1969 until September 1970, when he was invited to join [[Aerosmith]]. He was later replaced with drummer Paul Klodner and bassist Steve Strout, which gave them a tight a punchy rhythm section.  Chubby and The Turnpikes signed with [[Capitol Records]] in 1967 and had a couple of local hit records including \"I Know The Inside Story\" in 1967 and \"Nothing But Promises\" in 1968.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/5938521/page/4] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428010134/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/5938521/page/4 |date=April 28, 2009 }}</ref> By 1973, they had changed their name to Tavares and scored their first R&B Top 10 (Pop Top 40) hit with \"Check it Out\", and soon began charting regularly on the [[R&B]] and [[Pop music|pop]] charts. Their first album included their brother Victor, who sang lead on \"Check it Out\", but dropped out of the group shortly afterward. In 1974 Tavares had a No. 1 R&B hit with [[Hall & Oates]]'s \"[[She's Gone (Hall & Oates song)|She's Gone]]\",  (which became a hit for Hall & Oates as well two years later).\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"Anonymous vocally, the creatures of various cheerfully crass producers, these five brothers are professional entertainers without apology.\"|source=\u2014 ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981)<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|title-link=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: T|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=T&bk=70|accessdate=March 15, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>|width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\n\n1975 turned out to be their most successful year chartwise, with a Top 40 Pop album (''[[In the City (Tavares album)|In the City]]''), the No. 25 hit \"Remember What I Told You to Forget\", and their biggest hit, the Top 10 Pop/No. 1 R&B smash \"[[It Only Takes a Minute]]\", which was later successfully covered by both [[Jonathan King]] and [[Take That]], and sampled by [[Jennifer Lopez]].  They parlayed this success into a spot as an opening act for The Jackson 5. [[KC and The Sunshine Band]] was also on this tour.  \"Minute\" was followed by a string of hits:  \"[[Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel]]\" (1976), \"Don't Take Away the Music\" (1976), and \"[[Whodunit (song)|Whodunit]]\" (1977, another No. 1 R&B hit).  In 1977 they also recorded \"I Wanna See You Soon\", a duet with Capitol labelmate [[Freda Payne]], which received airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]] but failed to chart.\n\nMany of their hits, however, underplayed their R&B background and gave the group the image of being a [[disco]] act.  This perception was reinforced by their appearance on [[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] to the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' in 1977.  Tavares recorded the [[Bee Gees]] song \"[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)#Tavares version|More Than a Woman]]\", and their version reached the Pop Top 40 that year.  The soundtrack became one of the most successful in history, giving Tavares their only [[Grammy]].\n\nLater albums, such as ''[[Madam Butterfly (album)|Madam Butterfly]]'' and ''[[Supercharged (album)|Supercharged]]'', strayed from the [[disco]] format and were less successful on the pop chart (although they continued to have Top 10 R&B hits such as \"Never Had a Love Like This Before\" and the popular sociopolitical \"Bad Times\" written by British singer-songwriter [[Gerard McMahon]]). At the start of the 1980s, Tavares left [[Capitol Records]], signing with [[RCA]]. They had one last major hit, the ballad \"A Penny for Your Thoughts\", for which they were nominated for a Grammy in 1982; their last major release was ''Words and Music'' in 1983.\n\nIn 1984, Ralph stepped down from the group. Pooch took over as the noncommissioned business/booking agent for TAVARES from 1984 to 2014. Tiny left in the mid-1990s to pursue his solo career, while the other three brothers continued to tour. Tiny rejoined the group in 2009. In 2014 Pooch suffered a devastating stroke and the business/booking for TAVARES was turned over to Oriola Mngmt LLC. Pooch believed in the family business TAVARES and loyally stayed true to it throughout his singing career. He thanks his brother Ralph for stepping in during his illness. Pooch has regained his health and opts for retirement leaving the fans with the image of his last performance.\n\n\"It Only Takes a Minute\" was later covered by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[boy band]] [[Take That]], becoming a Top 10 UK hit, and is featured in the soundtrack of [[Konami]]'s dancing game [[Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix]].\n\n\"Out of the Picture\" was sampled by [[50 Cent]] in his 2003 song \"Many Men (Wish Death)\".\n\nMusician [[Feliciano Vierra Tavares|Feliciano \"Flash\" Vierra Tavares]], the family [[patriarch]] and father of all members of Tavares, died in 2008.<ref name=st>{{cite news |first=Don|last=Coddy|title=Tavares patriarch dies |url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081219/NEWS/812190341|work= [[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)]] |publisher=|date=December 19, 2008 |accessdate=December 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nChubby Tavares released his first solo album, ''Jealousy'', on July 17, 2012, a few months after Tavares, the [[Four Tops]] (who recorded the original version of \"Remember What I Told You To Forget\"), and [[The Temptations]] toured the [[United Kingdom|UK]] together.

Born and raised in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], they would later move to [[New Bedford]], [[Massachusetts]]. They were inducted into the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame in 2014.\nThey consist of:\n* ''Ralph'' \u2014 Ralph Edward Vierra Tavares (b. December 10, 1941)\n* ''Pooch'' \u2014 Arthur Paul Tavares (b. November 12, 1942)\n* ''Chubby'' \u2014 Antone Lee Tavares (b. June 2, 1944)\n* ''Butch'' \u2014 Feliciano Vierra Tavares, Jr. (b.

October 23, 1949)\n\n== History ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2013}}\nThe brothers, whose parents were of Cape Verdean descent, started performing in 1959 as '''Chubby and the Turnpikes''' when the youngest brother was nine years old. [[P-Funk]] keyboardist/architect [[Bernie Worrell]] briefly joined the group in 1968 while attending the [[New England Conservatory of Music]]. Future [[Aerosmith]] drummer [[Joey Kramer]] appeared as the \"token white-guy drummer\" in a later incarnation called ''The Turnpikes'' from the fall of 1969 until September 1970, when he was invited to join [[Aerosmith]]. He was later replaced with drummer Paul Klodner and bassist Steve Strout, which gave them a tight a punchy rhythm section.  Chubby and The Turnpikes signed with [[Capitol Records]] in 1967 and had a couple of local hit records including \"I Know The Inside Story\" in 1967 and \"Nothing But Promises\" in 1968.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/5938521/page/4] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428010134/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/5938521/page/4 |date=April 28, 2009 }}</ref> By 1973, they had changed their name to Tavares and scored their first R&B Top 10 (Pop Top 40) hit with \"Check it Out\", and soon began charting regularly on the [[R&B]] and [[Pop music|pop]] charts. Their first album included their brother Victor, who sang lead on \"Check it Out\", but dropped out of the group shortly afterward. In 1974 Tavares had a No. 1 R&B hit with [[Hall & Oates]]'s \"[[She's Gone (Hall & Oates song)|She's Gone]]\",  (which became a hit for Hall & Oates as well two years later).\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"Anonymous vocally, the creatures of various cheerfully crass producers, these five brothers are professional entertainers without apology.\"|source=\u2014 ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981)<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|title-link=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: T|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=T&bk=70|accessdate=March 15, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>|width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\n\n1975 turned out to be their most successful year chartwise, with a Top 40 Pop album (''[[In the City (Tavares album)|In the City]]''), the No. 25 hit \"Remember What I Told You to Forget\", and their biggest hit, the Top 10 Pop/No. 1 R&B smash \"[[It Only Takes a Minute]]\", which was later successfully covered by both [[Jonathan King]] and [[Take That]], and sampled by [[Jennifer Lopez]].  They parlayed this success into a spot as an opening act for The Jackson 5. [[KC and The Sunshine Band]] was also on this tour.  \"Minute\" was followed by a string of hits:  \"[[Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel]]\" (1976), \"Don't Take Away the Music\" (1976), and \"[[Whodunit (song)|Whodunit]]\" (1977, another No. 1 R&B hit).  In 1977 they also recorded \"I Wanna See You Soon\", a duet with Capitol labelmate [[Freda Payne]], which received airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]] but failed to chart.\n\nMany of their hits, however, underplayed their R&B background and gave the group the image of being a [[disco]] act.  This perception was reinforced by their appearance on [[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] to the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' in 1977.  Tavares recorded the [[Bee Gees]] song \"[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)#Tavares version|More Than a Woman]]\", and their version reached the Pop Top 40 that year.  The soundtrack became one of the most successful in history, giving Tavares their only [[Grammy]].\n\nLater albums, such as ''[[Madam Butterfly (album)|Madam Butterfly]]'' and ''[[Supercharged (album)|Supercharged]]'', strayed from the [[disco]] format and were less successful on the pop chart (although they continued to have Top 10 R&B hits such as \"Never Had a Love Like This Before\" and the popular sociopolitical \"Bad Times\" written by British singer-songwriter [[Gerard McMahon]]). At the start of the 1980s, Tavares left [[Capitol Records]], signing with [[RCA]]. They had one last major hit, the ballad \"A Penny for Your Thoughts\", for which they were nominated for a Grammy in 1982; their last major release was ''Words and Music'' in 1983.\n\nIn 1984, Ralph stepped down from the group. Pooch took over as the noncommissioned business/booking agent for TAVARES from 1984 to 2014. Tiny left in the mid-1990s to pursue his solo career, while the other three brothers continued to tour. Tiny rejoined the group in 2009. In 2014 Pooch suffered a devastating stroke and the business/booking for TAVARES was turned over to Oriola Mngmt LLC. Pooch believed in the family business TAVARES and loyally stayed true to it throughout his singing career. He thanks his brother Ralph for stepping in during his illness. Pooch has regained his health and opts for retirement leaving the fans with the image of his last performance.\n\n\"It Only Takes a Minute\" was later covered by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[boy band]] [[Take That]], becoming a Top 10 UK hit, and is featured in the soundtrack of [[Konami]]'s dancing game [[Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix]].\n\n\"Out of the Picture\" was sampled by [[50 Cent]] in his 2003 song \"Many Men (Wish Death)\".\n\nMusician [[Feliciano Vierra Tavares|Feliciano \"Flash\" Vierra Tavares]], the family [[patriarch]] and father of all members of Tavares, died in 2008.<ref name=st>{{cite news |first=Don|last=Coddy|title=Tavares patriarch dies |url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081219/NEWS/812190341|work= [[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)]] |publisher=|date=December 19, 2008 |accessdate=December 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nChubby Tavares released his first solo album, ''Jealousy'', on July 17, 2012, a few months after Tavares, the [[Four Tops]] (who recorded the original version of \"Remember What I Told You To Forget\"), and [[The Temptations]] toured the [[United Kingdom|UK]] together. Preceding the album, a digital-only single was released called \"It's Christmas\". On December 17, it reached No. 5 on Amazon's Acid Jazz chart. Both the album and the single were produced by [[Carla Olson]], and the album was released by Fuel Records/Universal.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

The application of this is to allow photo management applications to use this information to manage images.\n\nSome of the existing methods for embedding location information to a captured image are:\n* A camera that has built-in GPS;\n* A camera with interface for an external GPS (the interface could be a physical connector or a [[bluetooth]] adapter to a remote [[GPS tracking unit#Data loggers|GPS logger]], or [[WiFi]] and an app to allow the camera to sync GPS from a smartphone);\n* A storage media (CF or SD card) that has GPS or WiFi built-in (products like [[Eye-Fi]] provides cards like this, only supported for some cameras).\n\n== List of cameras ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Manufacturer\n!Camera model\n!Camera type\n!Year\n!Method of

The application of this is to allow photo management applications to use this information to manage images.\n\nSome of the existing methods for embedding location information to a captured image are:\n* A camera that has built-in GPS;\n* A camera with interface for an external GPS (the interface could be a physical connector or a [[bluetooth]] adapter to a remote [[GPS tracking unit#Data loggers|GPS logger]], or [[WiFi]] and an app to allow the camera to sync GPS from a smartphone);\n* A storage media (CF or SD card) that has GPS or WiFi built-in (products like [[Eye-Fi]] provides

Yorktown is one of the three points of the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]]. It is the site of the last battle and surrender of British forces in 1781 at the conclusion of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when the patriots gained independence from [[Great Britain]].\n\nIn modern times, several important U.S. military installations have been developed in the county. It also has miles of waterfront residential and recreational areas. York County adjoins the [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] [[theme park]] and includes within its borders the affiliated [[Water Country USA]] [[water park]], the [[Yorktown Riverfront]] area, [[Colonial_National_Historical_Park#Yorktown_Battlefield |Yorktown Battlefield and Visitor Center]] and [[American Revolution Museum at Yorktown]]. Yorktown is linked by the [[National Park Service|National Park Service's]] bucolic [[Colonial Parkway]] with [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and historic attractions at [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. Heritage tourism to the Historic Triangle draws international visitors and is a major economic activity for the county.\n\n==History==\n\n===Native American Indians===\nThe area which is now York County was long inhabited by succeeding cultures of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. These were [[hunter-gatherer]] groups during the late [[Woodland Period]] (1000 BC to AD 1000) and earlier.\n\nBy the late 16th century, much of the [[Atlantic coastal plain|coastal plain]] draining to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] of the current Commonwealth of Virginia was called ''[[Tenakomakah]]'' in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], meaning \"densely inhabited land\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Capossela|first1=Julie Ann|title=Jamestown from a Non-Western Perspective|url=http://www.wm.edu/niahd/journals/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965 |website=wm.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022073344/http://niahd.wm.edu/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965&svr=www|archivedate=22 October 2008|date=2 February 2006}} ''c.f.'' [[Anishinaabe language]]: ''danakamigaa'': \"activity-grounds\", ''i.e.'' \"land of much events [for the People]\"</ref> The historic tribes of the Tidewater area spoke related Algonquian languages. Other Algonquian-speaking peoples occupied coastal areas north and into present-day Canada, as well as to the South.\n\nIn the Virginia region, a [[weroance]] (or chief) named [[Wahunsunacock]] (1547\u20131618) of the [[Powhatan people]] created a powerful empire of eastern-Algonquian language-speaking peoples known as the [[Powhatan Confederacy]]; he conquered or allied by agreement with approximately 30 tribes. Known as the Powhatan, meaning the paramount chief, he was from a village also known as \"Powhatan\", near the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]] of the [[James River]]. (The Powhatan Hill neighborhood of the current city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was developed near this former site.) Chief Powhatan later established a second capital village, known as [[Werowocomoco]], in a centrally located position in Tenakomakah. Rediscovered in the early 21st century by archeological work, it was located along the north bank of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] in present-day [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester County]].<ref>[http://powhatan.wm.edu/history/index.htm Powhatan: \"Powhatan: Werowocomoco\"], College of William and Mary</ref>\n\nThe [[Chiskiack]] tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy lived in York County along the York River until the 1630s. Escalating conflicts with the expanding English colony based at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] caused them to move to the west. The English developed a village settlement near the village of Chiskiack and adopted its name. (It is sometimes spelled \"Kiskiack\"). This became part of the developments included within the present-day [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] near Yorktown and are included in the military base. Cheesecake Road and Cheesecake Cemetery are also within the base; their names are thought to derive from the early Chiskiack people.\n\nAfter the Powhatan moved his capital from this area in 1609, the site believed to have been Werowocomoco near [[Purtan Bay]] was lost to history. It was rediscovered in the early 21st century, and has been under continuing [[archaeological]] study projects. The discoveries and ongoing research led by the [[College of William and Mary]] hold great promise in expanding understanding of the lives of the Native Americans in the area during that era of York County's history.\n\n{{details|Powhatan Confederacy}}\n\n===Ajac\u00e1n Mission===\nIn 1570, Spanish [[Jesuit]] priests founded the [[Ajac\u00e1n Mission]] in this area. They were guided by interpreter [[Don Luis]], a Native American from this area who had been taken captive by an earlier expedition. He was taken to Spain and later to Mexico, where he was baptized as Don Luis and educated in the Jesuit system. Ten years later after returning to Virginia, he soon abandoned the Spanish group. In February 1571 he led an attack on the Jesuits; all of the party except a young boy were killed. The following year, a Spanish force returned to the region for punishment and reclaimed the youth Alonso. The Spanish did not attempt another mission in this part of North America.\n\n===Virginia Colony===\nAbout 30 years later, English colonists arrived and established [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607 on the southern shore of the [[Virginia Peninsula]] in the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]]. In 1619, the area which is now York County was included in two of the four incorporations (or \"citties\") of the proprietary [[Virginia Company of London]] which were known as [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] and [[James City (Virginia Company)|James Cittie]].\n\nIn 1634, what is now York County was formed as [[Charles River Shire]], one of the eight original [[shires of Virginia]]<ref name=\"archive.org\"/> and named for [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. Charles River Shire took its name from the younger son of King [[James I of England|James I]]. In the 21st century, it was one of the five original shires considered extant in essentially its same political form, making it one of the oldest counties in the United States.\n\nIn 1643 Charles River County and the Charles River (also named for the king) were changed to York County<ref name=\"William Waller Hening 1809 page 249\"/> and [[York River (Virginia)|York River]], respectively. The river, county, and town of [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] are believed to have been named for [[York]], a city in [[Northern England]].\n\n===Yorktown===\n[[File:YorkHallYorktown.jpg|thumb|175px|York Hall]]\n\nThe first courthouse and jail were located near what is now [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] although the community, founded as a port for shipping [[tobacco]] to Europe, as variously called Port of York, Borough of York, York, Town of York, until Yorktown was established in 1691, when the [[House of Burgesses]] required each county to designate a port of entry and build warehousing. Although never formally incorporated as a town, Yorktown is the [[county seat]] of York County. The only town ever incorporated within the county's boundaries was [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which was incorporated in 1952 and became an [[independent city]] in 1975.\n\n[[Porto Bello (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Porto Bello]], the hunting lodge of [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], last royal governor of Virginia, still stands on the grounds of Camp Peary. It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nIt is most famous as the site of the surrender of General [[Cornwallis]] to General [[George Washington]] in 1781, ending the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Yorktown also figured prominently in the [[American Civil War]] during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] in 1862.\n\n===Other communities, boundary changes===\nThe small unincorporated town of [[Lackey, Virginia|Lackey]] and a nearby area known as \"the Reservation\" were taken over by the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War I]]. This is now part of the [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]]. Many of the displaced [[African American]] landowners were eventually relocated to [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], along the border between York and James counties.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the sites of three other small York County towns were absorbed into U.S. government reservations. [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]] was the site of a [[World War I]] munitions facility operated by the [[DuPont]] company, and was made a part of [[Cheatham Annex]]) in 1943. To the west of Penniman, which is reported to have had a peak population of 15,000, on land which is now part of [[Camp Peary]], the smaller towns of [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]] and [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]] were located. Much of Magruder's population and at least one church were relocated to Grove, increasing its population.\n\nIn 1949, the county grew by {{convert|4|sqmi|km2|0}}, as land in that amount was ceded to York County by neighboring [[Warwick County, Virginia|Warwick County]]. At the time, the move was part of a successful attempt by Warwick County to block an annexation suit brought by the [[Newport News, Virginia|City of Newport News]]. Warwick eventually consolidated with the city in 1958 by mutual agreement. (The reduction in size allowed Warwick County to claim an exemption from the proposed annexation at the time).\n\nIn 1975, the county lost {{convert|15.5|sqmi|km2|1}} of land as the [[incorporated town]] of [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which had been within York County, became an [[independent city]], although ties between the county and the new city remained close. Over 40 years later, they continue to share courts, sheriff's office, a jail, and some constitutional services.\n\nYork County also adjoins another small independent city, Williamsburg, which was long located within James City County. In the 20th century, some areas of York County adjacent to Williamsburg were lost to the growing small city through annexation.\n\n===York County in the late 20th and early 21st centuries===\nFrom the 1980s to modern times, York County experienced a rapid transition from a rural county to a bedroom community for the neighboring core cities of [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] and [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]].\n\nIn modern times, York County and Yorktown in particular are part of an important historical area of attractions known as the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]], which includes Yorktown, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. Yorktown is the northern terminus of the scenic [[Colonial Parkway]] operated by the U.S. [[National Park Service]] which links the three. In 2005, the county completed Riverwalk Landing, a successful pseudo-colonial waterfront development at Yorktown to revitalize the previously deteriorating beach and town district and complement the 2007 celebration of Jamestown.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Entering Coleman Bridge from Yorktown Side.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Coleman Bridge connects York County and neighboring Gloucester County]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|215|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|105|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|110|sqmi|km2}} (51.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the third-smallest county in Virginia by land area. It is near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAlso, in terms of population clusters, the County is divided by a vast expanse of federal land in the midsection of the county, much of which is densely wooded park land, and military training areas. The southern portion of the County is dense with suburban developments and contains the majority of the county's population. There is little room for additional growth in the southern portion of York County because it is a relatively small area, and was essentially fully developed by the early 2000s. A small industrial area along the York River just East of Yorktown contains a power plant owned by Dominion Virginia Power, and a petroleum terminal on the former site of an oil refinery that ceased operation in 2010.\n\nThe northern portion is more connected with the Williamsburg community than Yorktown and, although less populous than the south, is also fairly dense. Having not seen a significant amount of growth until recently, the northern portion is now seeing the development of new residential communities and shopping areas.\n\n===Adjacent counties and cities===\n\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n* [[Gloucester County, Virginia]] (north)\n* [[Mathews County, Virginia]] (northeast)\n* [[Northampton County, Virginia]] (east)\n* [[Poquoson, Virginia]] (southeast)\n|\n* [[Hampton, Virginia]] (south)\n* [[Newport News, Virginia]] (southwest)\n* [[James City County, Virginia]] (west)\n* [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] (west)\n|}\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Colonial National Historical Park]] (part)\n\n===Climate===\n\n{{climate chart\n| Yorktown, VA <ref>http://www.usa.com/yorktown-va-weather.htm#HistoricalTemperature</ref>\n|28.3|48.1|3.6\n|30.5|51.6|3.2\n|36.6|59.9|4.3\n|45.4|70.1|3.3\n|54.6|77.4|3.9\n|63.6|85.1|3.5\n|68|88.8|4.6\n|66.3|86.6|4.7\n|59.7|80.8|4.2\n|48.4|71.2|3.4\n|39.7|61.6|3.3\n|31.5|51.6|3.4\n|units = imperial\n|clear = both }}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 5233\n|1800= 3231\n|1810= 5187\n|1820= 4384\n|1830= 5354\n|1840= 4720\n|1850= 4460\n|1860= 4949\n|1870= 7198\n|1880= 7349\n|1890= 7596\n|1900= 7482\n|1910= 7757\n|1920= 8046\n|1930= 7615\n|1940= 8857\n|1950= 11750\n|1960= 21583\n|1970= 33203\n|1980= 35463\n|1990= 42422\n|2000= 56297\n|2010= 65464\n|estyear=2019\n|estimate=68280\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2019\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2019.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/va190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Located along the York River, small portions of each base extend into adjacent James City County as well.\n\nThe [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] was originally established during [[World War I]] by order of President [[Woodrow Wilson]], and now includes the formerly separate Cheatham Annex Supply Complex. [[Camp Peary]] was established during [[World War II]] as a [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]] Training Base. As the war progressed, it became valuable to the Allied Forces to house sensitive prisoners-of-war from captured German naval vessels; it was important for Nazi authorities to be unaware of their capture, since that also meant secret code books thought lost-at sea may also have been compromised. Many of these POWs made Virginia and the United States their new homeland after the War. Separating these two large military reservations is [[Queen's Creek]], which originates in the western reaches of the county and drains to the York River.\n\nYork County contains some [[Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia|former towns]] including Yorke, and a large number when the military reservations were created in the first half of the 20th century. These include the original [[Lackey, Virginia|Lackey]] (known locally as \"the Reservation\"), [[Halstead's Point, Virginia|Halstead's Point]], [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]], [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]], and [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]]. Many relocated residents and their descendants, many of whom were farmers and watermen, now live in such places as Yorktown, Gloucester, [[Lee Hall, Virginia|Lee Hall]], [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], and [[Lightfoot, Virginia|Lightfoot]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in York County, Virginia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Publications===\n* McCartney, Martha W.

Yorktown is one of the three points of the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]]. It is the site of the last battle and surrender of British forces in 1781 at the conclusion of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when the patriots gained independence from [[Great Britain]].\n\nIn modern times, several important U.S. military installations have been developed in the county. It also has miles of waterfront residential and recreational areas. York County adjoins the [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] [[theme park]] and includes within its borders the affiliated [[Water Country USA]] [[water park]], the [[Yorktown Riverfront]] area, [[Colonial_National_Historical_Park#Yorktown_Battlefield |Yorktown Battlefield and Visitor Center]] and [[American Revolution Museum at Yorktown]]. Yorktown is linked by the [[National Park Service|National Park Service's]] bucolic [[Colonial Parkway]] with [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and historic attractions at [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. Heritage tourism to the Historic Triangle draws international visitors and is a major economic activity for the county.\n\n==History==\n\n===Native American Indians===\nThe area which is now York County was long inhabited by succeeding cultures of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. These were [[hunter-gatherer]] groups during the late [[Woodland Period]] (1000 BC to AD 1000) and earlier.\n\nBy the late 16th century, much of the [[Atlantic coastal plain|coastal plain]] draining to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] of the current Commonwealth of Virginia was called ''[[Tenakomakah]]'' in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], meaning \"densely inhabited land\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Capossela|first1=Julie Ann|title=Jamestown from a Non-Western Perspective|url=http://www.wm.edu/niahd/journals/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965 |website=wm.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022073344/http://niahd.wm.edu/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965&svr=www|archivedate=22 October 2008|date=2 February 2006}} ''c.f.'' [[Anishinaabe language]]: ''danakamigaa'': \"activity-grounds\", ''i.e.'' \"land of much events [for the People]\"</ref> The historic tribes of the Tidewater area spoke related Algonquian languages. Other Algonquian-speaking peoples occupied coastal areas north and into present-day Canada, as well as to the South.\n\nIn the Virginia region, a [[weroance]] (or chief) named [[Wahunsunacock]] (1547\u20131618) of the [[Powhatan people]] created a powerful empire of eastern-Algonquian language-speaking peoples known as the [[Powhatan Confederacy]]; he conquered or allied by agreement with approximately 30 tribes. Known as the Powhatan, meaning the paramount chief, he was from a village also known as \"Powhatan\", near the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]] of the [[James River]]. (The Powhatan Hill neighborhood of the current city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was developed near this former site.) Chief Powhatan later established a second capital village, known as [[Werowocomoco]], in a centrally located position in Tenakomakah. Rediscovered in the early 21st century by archeological work, it was located along the north bank of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] in present-day [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester County]].<ref>[http://powhatan.wm.edu/history/index.htm Powhatan: \"Powhatan: Werowocomoco\"], College of William and Mary</ref>\n\nThe [[Chiskiack]] tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy lived in York County along the York River until the 1630s. Escalating conflicts with the expanding English colony based at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] caused them to move to the west. The English developed a village settlement near the village of Chiskiack and adopted its name. (It is sometimes spelled \"Kiskiack\"). This became part of the developments included within the present-day [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] near Yorktown and are included in the military base. Cheesecake Road and Cheesecake Cemetery are also within the base; their names are thought to derive from the early Chiskiack people.\n\nAfter the Powhatan moved his capital from this area in 1609, the site believed to have been Werowocomoco near [[Purtan Bay]] was lost to history. It was rediscovered in the early 21st century, and has been under continuing [[archaeological]] study projects. The discoveries and ongoing research led by the [[College of William and Mary]] hold great promise in expanding understanding of the lives of the Native Americans in the area during that era of York County's history.\n\n{{details|Powhatan Confederacy}}\n\n===Ajac\u00e1n Mission===\nIn 1570, Spanish [[Jesuit]] priests founded the [[Ajac\u00e1n Mission]] in this area. They were guided by interpreter [[Don Luis]], a Native American from this area who had been taken captive by an earlier expedition. He was taken to Spain and later to Mexico, where he was baptized as Don Luis and educated in the Jesuit system. Ten years later after returning to Virginia, he soon abandoned the Spanish group. In February 1571 he led an attack on the Jesuits; all of the party except a young boy were killed. The following year, a Spanish force returned to the region for punishment and reclaimed the youth Alonso. The Spanish did not attempt another mission in this part of North America.\n\n===Virginia Colony===\nAbout 30 years later, English colonists arrived and established [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607 on the southern shore of the [[Virginia Peninsula]] in the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]]. In 1619, the area which is now York County was included in two of the four incorporations (or \"citties\") of the proprietary [[Virginia Company of London]] which were known as [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] and [[James City (Virginia Company)|James Cittie]].\n\nIn 1634, what is now York County was formed as [[Charles River Shire]], one of the eight original [[shires of Virginia]]<ref name=\"archive.org\"/> and named for [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. Charles River Shire took its name from the younger son of King [[James I of England|James I]]. In the 21st century, it was one of the five original shires considered extant in essentially its same political form, making it one of the oldest counties in the United States.\n\nIn 1643 Charles River County and the Charles River (also named for the king) were changed to York County<ref name=\"William Waller Hening 1809 page 249\"/> and [[York River (Virginia)|York River]], respectively. The river, county, and town of [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] are believed to have been named for [[York]], a city in [[Northern England]].\n\n===Yorktown===\n[[File:YorkHallYorktown.jpg|thumb|175px|York Hall]]\n\nThe first courthouse and jail were located near what is now [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] although the community, founded as a port for shipping [[tobacco]] to Europe, as variously called Port of York, Borough of York, York, Town of York, until Yorktown was established in 1691, when the [[House of Burgesses]] required each county to designate a port of entry and build warehousing. Although never formally incorporated as a town, Yorktown is the [[county seat]] of York County. The only town ever incorporated within the county's boundaries was [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which was incorporated in 1952 and became an [[independent city]] in 1975.\n\n[[Porto Bello (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Porto Bello]], the hunting lodge of [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], last royal governor of Virginia, still stands on the grounds of Camp Peary. It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nIt is most famous as the site of the surrender of General [[Cornwallis]] to General [[George Washington]] in 1781, ending the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Yorktown also figured prominently in the [[American Civil War]] during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] in 1862.\n\n===Other communities, boundary changes===\nThe small unincorporated town of [[Lackey, Virginia|Lackey]] and a nearby area known as \"the Reservation\" were taken over by the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War I]]. This is now part of the [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]]. Many of the displaced [[African American]] landowners were eventually relocated to [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], along the border between York and James counties.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the sites of three other small York County towns were absorbed into U.S. government reservations. [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]] was the site of a [[World War I]] munitions facility operated by the [[DuPont]] company, and was made a part of [[Cheatham Annex]]) in 1943. To the west of Penniman, which is reported to have had a peak population of 15,000, on land which is now part of [[Camp Peary]], the smaller towns of [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]] and [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]] were located. Much of Magruder's population and at least one church were relocated to Grove, increasing its population.\n\nIn 1949, the county grew by {{convert|4|sqmi|km2|0}}, as land in that amount was ceded to York County by neighboring [[Warwick County, Virginia|Warwick County]]. At the time, the move was part of a successful attempt by Warwick County to block an annexation suit brought by the [[Newport News, Virginia|City of Newport News]]. Warwick eventually consolidated with the city in 1958 by mutual agreement. (The reduction in size allowed Warwick County to claim an exemption from the proposed annexation at the time).\n\nIn 1975, the county lost {{convert|15.5|sqmi|km2|1}} of land as the [[incorporated town]] of [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which had been within York County, became an [[independent city]], although ties between the county and the new city remained close. Over 40 years later, they continue to share courts, sheriff's office, a jail, and some constitutional services.\n\nYork County also adjoins another small independent city, Williamsburg, which was long located within James City County. In the 20th century, some areas of York County adjacent to Williamsburg were lost to the growing small city through annexation.\n\n===York County in the late 20th and early 21st centuries===\nFrom the 1980s to modern times, York County experienced a rapid transition from a rural county to a bedroom community for the neighboring core cities of [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] and [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]].\n\nIn modern times, York County and Yorktown in particular are part of an important historical area of attractions known as the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]], which includes Yorktown, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. Yorktown is the northern terminus of the scenic [[Colonial Parkway]] operated by the U.S. [[National Park Service]] which links the three. In 2005, the county completed Riverwalk Landing, a successful pseudo-colonial waterfront development at Yorktown to revitalize the previously deteriorating beach and town district and complement the 2007 celebration of Jamestown.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Entering Coleman Bridge from Yorktown Side.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Coleman Bridge connects York County and neighboring Gloucester County]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|215|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|105|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|110|sqmi|km2}} (51.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the third-smallest county in Virginia by land area. It is near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAlso, in terms of population clusters, the County is divided by a vast expanse of federal land in the midsection of the county, much of which is densely wooded park land, and military training areas. The southern portion of the County is dense with suburban developments and contains the majority of the county's population. There is little room for additional growth in the southern portion of York County because it is a relatively small area, and was essentially fully developed by the early 2000s. A small industrial area along the York River just East of Yorktown contains a power plant owned by Dominion Virginia Power, and a petroleum terminal on the former site of an oil refinery that ceased operation in 2010.\n\nThe northern portion is more connected with the Williamsburg community than Yorktown and, although less populous than the south, is also fairly dense. Having not seen a significant amount of growth until recently, the northern portion is now seeing the development of new residential communities and shopping areas.\n\n===Adjacent counties and cities===\n\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n* [[Gloucester County, Virginia]] (north)\n* [[Mathews County, Virginia]] (northeast)\n* [[Northampton County, Virginia]] (east)\n* [[Poquoson, Virginia]] (southeast)\n|\n* [[Hampton, Virginia]] (south)\n* [[Newport News, Virginia]] (southwest)\n* [[James City County, Virginia]] (west)\n* [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] (west)\n|}\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Colonial National Historical Park]] (part)\n\n===Climate===\n\n{{climate chart\n| Yorktown, VA <ref>http://www.usa.com/yorktown-va-weather.htm#HistoricalTemperature</ref>\n|28.3|48.1|3.6\n|30.5|51.6|3.2\n|36.6|59.9|4.3\n|45.4|70.1|3.3\n|54.6|77.4|3.9\n|63.6|85.1|3.5\n|68|88.8|4.6\n|66.3|86.6|4.7\n|59.7|80.8|4.2\n|48.4|71.2|3.4\n|39.7|61.6|3.3\n|31.5|51.6|3.4\n|units = imperial\n|clear = both }}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 5233\n|1800= 3231\n|1810= 5187\n|1820= 4384\n|1830= 5354\n|1840= 4720\n|1850= 4460\n|1860= 4949\n|1870= 7198\n|1880= 7349\n|1890= 7596\n|1900= 7482\n|1910= 7757\n|1920= 8046\n|1930= 7615\n|1940= 8857\n|1950= 11750\n|1960= 21583\n|1970= 33203\n|1980= 35463\n|1990= 42422\n|2000= 56297\n|2010= 65464\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=67846\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/va190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Located along the York River, small portions of each base extend into adjacent James City County as well.\n\nThe [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] was originally established during [[World War I]] by order of President [[Woodrow Wilson]], and now includes the formerly separate Cheatham Annex Supply Complex. [[Camp Peary]] was established during [[World War II]] as a [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]] Training Base. As the war progressed, it became valuable to the Allied Forces to house sensitive prisoners-of-war from captured German naval vessels; it was important for Nazi authorities to be unaware of their capture, since that also meant secret code books thought lost-at sea may also have been compromised. Many of these POWs made Virginia and the United States their new homeland after the War. Separating these two large military reservations is [[Queen's Creek]], which originates in the western reaches of the county and drains to the York River.\n\nYork County contains some [[Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia|former towns]] including Yorke, and a large number when the military reservations were created in the first half of the 20th century. These include the original [[Lackey, Virginia|Lackey]] (known locally as \"the Reservation\"), [[Halstead's Point, Virginia|Halstead's Point]], [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]], [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]], and [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]]. Many relocated residents and their descendants, many of whom were farmers and watermen, now live in such places as Yorktown, Gloucester, [[Lee Hall, Virginia|Lee Hall]], [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], and [[Lightfoot, Virginia|Lightfoot]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in York County, Virginia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Publications===\n* McCartney, Martha W.
