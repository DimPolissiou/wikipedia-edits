After the sponsorship deal ran out for the stand, it became known as the North Stand but then renamed again after the Wasps' purchase of the Alan Higgs Charity share of Arena Coventry Limited. Coventry City announced that for the 2015/16 season that the stand would be closed for football matches due to costs but will be opened if the demand is there, however tickets can still be bought there for Wasps' fixtures.\n\n=== West Stand ===\nThe only two-tier stand at the Stadium, it consists of a larger lower tier below the upper tier, which consists of corporate hospitality boxes. Also situated on this side of the stadium are hotel rooms, which have a view of the pitch. In the corner between this stand and the South Stand is a Police control box.<ref>{{cite web|title = Ricoh Arena {{!}} Coventry City FC {{!}} Football Ground Guide|url = http://www.footballgroundguide.com/leagues/england/league-one/ricoh-arena-coventry-city.html|website = www.footballgroundguide.com|accessdate = 5 February 2016|first = Duncan|last = Adams}}</ref> This is the only stand that offers cushioned seats and it also provides seating for directors as well as the media.\n\n=== East Stand ===\nThe East Stand provided a video screen in the corner by the South Stand until 2018, this corner soon became known as the Singers' corner to Coventry fans as first called by Aidy Boothroyd, when he was manager of the Sky Blues. This is where the main cameras are positioned for the highlights of fixtures as well as the televised fixtures. The stand has been formerly known as the NTL stand and the Tesco Stand.\n\n=== South Stand ===\nThis stand is used for Away Supports for football matches and only opens for Rugby matches when needed due to extra demand. However the stand has opened for home supporters in the past for Coventry City fixtures for fixtures against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] as there was heavy demand by the home support but there was no large followings from the away side. Clubs such as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]], [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] have sold out the stand in the past. The stand has had previous names in the past, due to sponsors. In October 2018 the capacity of the stand was reduced when a new large screen was installed to replace the previous one situated between the South and East stands<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.wasps.co.uk/news/big-screen-launch/ |title = Big screen launch}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n\n=== Stadium Bowl ===\n[[File:Ricoh Arena - geograph.org.uk - 901396.jpg|thumbnail|Stadium Bowl used mainly for Rugby Union]]\nThe ''stadium bowl'' has a [[seating capacity]] of 32,609 with the overall capacity rising to 40,000 for concerts and has easy access to refreshments for customers from the many bar and food outlets around the bowl.

However, the stadium was constructed on the former site of the 'Foleshill' gasworks complex, although the Foleshill district itself begins more than a mile to the south east. The stadium is located within a quarter-mile of the boundary with [[Nuneaton and Bedworth]] and the county of [[Warwickshire]].

The previously agreed rent amounted to \u00a31.2&nbsp;million per year, but did not give Coventry City access to matchday revenue.\n\nA deadline of 27 December 2012 was given by ACL for unpaid rent. After the deadline passed, a winding up order was enforced through the High Court. Subsequently, after ACL planned to place Coventry City FC Ltd into administration, the club itself entered administration, accepting a 10-point penalty from the Football League as a consequence. A further 10-point penalty was incurred when ACL refused to accept the terms of a CVA proposed by the administrator. Coventry City Football Club has since been bought by Otium Entertainment Group.\n\nOn 23 March 2013, Coventry City moved all its staff and club shop stock from the Ricoh Arena after a long dispute over rent and access to matchday revenue with the club.<ref>{{cite news |title=Coventry City transfer staff and stock from Ricoh Arena |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21912436 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 March 2013 |accessdate=27 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] agreed to play their home games at [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]]'s [[Sixfields Stadium]] to ensure that they fulfilled their fixtures.

Reaching a peak in popularity in the early 80s, the band has continued a long-running successful career.\n\nRiot has toured with [[AC/DC]], [[Molly Hatchet]], [[Sammy Hagar]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Vandenberg (band)|Vandenberg]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] among others.\n\nRiot's sound initially started out as straightforward heavy metal, but since their 1988 release ''[[Thundersteel]]'' their musical direction has been more along the lines of power metal.\n\nIn 2013, Riot V, a new iteration of the band was launched by the surviving members, after the death of founding member and band leader [[Mark Reale]].\n\nThe group usually uses a baby seal face as a logo on its album covers.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years (1975\u20131983)===\nRiot was formed in 1975 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] when [[Kon-Tiki]] guitarist [[Mark Reale]] and drummer Peter Bitelli recruited bassist Phil Feit and vocalist [[Guy Speranza]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who\u2019s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|pages=298/9}}</ref> The line up recorded a four-track demo, which they hoped would be included in a proposed compilation of new rock bands. While waiting for the project to get off the ground, they added Steve Costello on keyboards.\n\nReale took the various demos to New York-based producers Billy Arnell and Steve Loeb, who also owned [[Greene St. Recording|Greene Street Recording Studio]] and the independent label Fire-Sign Records. Arnell and Loeb turned down the compilation proposal but signed Riot. The band added second guitarist Louie Kouvaris and replaced Feit with Jimmy Iommi, though both bass players participated in the recording of its debut album, ''[[Rock City (Riot album)|Rock City]]''<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>; the record was recorded and produced by Arnell and Loeb and released on their Fire Sign Records.  After a promising start and support slots with [[AC/DC]] and [[Molly Hatchet]], the band were unable to maintain momentum and were on the verge of breaking up by 1979.\n\nIn that year, however, the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] broke mainstream, and the band came to the attention of influential DJ [[Neal Kay]] who spread the word about them in Britain where fans bought imported copies of ''Rock City''. Encouraged, Arnell and Loeb, now Riot's managers, recorded the band's new album ''[[Narita (album)|Narita]]''. In the course of recording, Kouvaris was replaced by roadie Rick Ventura .<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nSubsequent to a successful support of [[Sammy Hagar]] on his US Texas tour, [[Capitol Records]] offered Riot a worldwide deal for ''Narita,'' mostly to support Hagar. Capitol and Hagar needed a harder, younger edge to associate with him, so Riot was chosen if they agreed to support Hagar on his UK tour. Hagar and Riot had a successful tour, but Riot was dropped by Capitol as soon as they were finished promoting Hagar.\n\nArnell and Loeb spent the remaining Capitol Records advance while retaining important indie FM radio promotions to promote the last Riot album. Arnell and Loeb put the album on as many radio stations around the country as possible, thus raising the radio profile enough to where Capitol picked up their option for another record, which led to Riot's biggest selling album, ''[[Fire Down Under]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nWhen the record was completed some months later, Capitol turned the record down calling it \"commercially unacceptable\",{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} which put the band in contractual limbo. Capitol refused to release the band from the contract. A campaign was organized and financed by producers Arnell and Loeb, and engaging fans around the world. Fans picketed the offices of EMI Records, especially in the UK.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Finally, [[Elektra Records]] reached an agreement with Capitol Vice President [[Rupert Perry]] and immediately released ''Fire Down Under'', which then soared into the [[Billboard 200]] chart.\n\n===Breakup, the \"Reunion\" and Reale's death (1983\u20132012)===\nSinger [[Guy Speranza]] (March 12, 1956 \u2013 November 8, 2003) had difficulty melding his religious convictions with his role in the band and was replaced by [[Rhett Forrester]] (September 22, 1956 \u2013  January 22, 1994) for the next album, ''[[Restless Breed]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Though a striking frontman, any hope of a major breakthrough was sunk by a combination of Forrester's erratic behaviour on the road, a changing of the guard at Elektra, and the 1983 success of [[Quiet Riot]]'s cover of \"[[Cum on Feel the Noize]]\".  The next album, ''[[Born in America]]'', (1983) was self-financed by Steve Loeb and was released on [[Quality Records]], an independent Canadian label.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>  A note on the reverse of the album tried to explain away would-be fans' confusion between Riot and the now No.&nbsp;1-selling Quiet Riot, but support melted away, leading to the band's disintegration.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nReale relocated to San Antonio, Texas, where he recruited former [[S.A.Slayer]] members Steve Cooper, Don Van Stavern, and Dave McClain (now with [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]]) for a short-lived new band called Narita.  By 1986, Reale and Van Stavern had made their way out to Los Angeles in an attempt to resurrect Riot along with former members Sandy Slavin and Rhett Forrester.  Harry 'The Tyrant' Conklin ([[Jag Panzer]]) handled vocals for a short time but was dismissed after losing his voice on the second night of back-to-back gigs due to excessive drinking.  Eventually, Reale reunited with producer Steve Loeb and moved back to New York.  Drummer Mark Edwards ([[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]], Third Stage Alert) was recruited to complete the new rhythm section with bassist Don Van Stavern, while Greene Street Studio manager Dave Harrington brought in [[Tony Moore (singer)|Tony Moore]] (real name: Tony Morabito) on vocals.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Loeb cut a four-track demo at his Greene Street Studio in Soho, New York and along with real estate maven turned rock manager Vince Perazzo, brought the band to [[CBS]] Associated, who offered the band a worldwide deal. Edwards elected to leave the band as his own Los Angeles-based group [[Lion (band)|Lion]] was getting signed to Scotti Brothers. He was  superseded by San Antonio, Texas native [[Bobby Jarzombek]], formerly with [[Juggernaut (band)|Juggernaut]], who cut the rest of the drum tracks for what became the ''[[Thundersteel]]'' album, released in 1988.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> It was followed by the more experimental ''[[The Privilege of Power]]'' (1990),<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which saw the band augment their state-of-the-art heavy metal sound with horns, courtesy of the [[Brecker Brothers]] and [[Tower of Power]].  The album also featured a guest vocal appearance by [[Joe Lynn Turner]] of [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] fame.  Second guitarist Mike Flyntz joined the ranks for the band's 1989 ''[[Thundersteel]]'' tour of Japan where Riot maintained their strongest subsequent following. Along with hiring tour manager Joey Batts who toured with them through the U.S and Japan.  Bassist Don Van Stavern quit the band after the US leg of the ''Privilege of Power'' tour and was replaced by fellow Texan Pete Perez (ex-Karion).\n\nIn 1992, vocalist Tony Moore left the group over disagreements with manager/producer Steve Loeb. Reale recruited newcomer [[Mike DiMeo]], who had played with [[Howard Stern]] sidekick [[Stuttering John]] Melendez in a local band named Josie Sang, with a view toward making a more hard rock-oriented solo album. Eventually, those plans were dropped and the proposed solo effort turned into another Riot album, 1993's ''[[Nightbreaker]]'',<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which featured a remake of the ''[[Fire Down Under]]'' track \"Outlaw\", as well as covers of [[Deep Purple]]'s \"[[Burn (Deep Purple song)|Burn]]\" and \"[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\" by [[Procol Harum]]. The following LP, the Native American-themed ''[[Brethren of the Long House]]'' (1996), which saw [[John Macaluso]] ([[TNT (Norwegian band)|TNT]], [[Powermad]]) briefly take over for Bobby Jarzombek on drums, marked the final collaboration with long-time associate Steve Loeb who stepped down from the production chair in 1995. All told, Loeb produced or co-produced 13 Riot albums in his 19-year association with Reale and the different configurations of Riot. For the rest of the decade Riot maintained a stable line-up for the first time in its history, resulting in a steady output of high-quality albums, i.e. ''[[Inishmore (album)|Inishmore]]'' (1998), ''[[Shine On (Riot album)|Shine On]]'' live (1998), and ''[[Sons of Society]]'' (1999).  Jarzombek left again in late 1999, this time to join former [[Judas Priest]] vocalist [[Rob Halford]] in his new venture [[Halford (band)|Halford]].  Pat Magrath (Prototype, Killing Culture) filled in for Jarzombek on the following European tour before being replaced by veteran skinsman [[Bobby Rondinelli]] (Rainbow, [[Black Sabbath]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]) with whom the band recorded ''[[Through the Storm (Riot album)|Through the Storm]]'' (2002).\n\nIn 2006, Riot returned with yet another album, ''[[Army of One (album)|Army of One]]'', featuring new addition Frank Gilchriest ([[Virgin Steele]], Gothic Knights) on drums. It marked the final album with vocalist [[Mike DiMeo]] who had earlier announced his departure in order to concentrate on his work with retro rockers The Lizards after a 12-year run with Riot.  DiMeo was succeeded by the New York area singer Mike Tirelli, whose Riot live debut came in early 2005 at the band's Atarfe Vega Rock Festival appearance in [[Granada]], Spain.\n\nRiot with Tirelli toured the United States for most of 2005, and made an appearance in Japan in both 2006 and 2007, and undertook an extensive tour of Spain in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, it was announced that the classic ''[[Thundersteel]]''-era line-up would reunite for a tour,<ref>{{cite web|title=Riot's 'Thundersteel' lineup to tour Europe in June|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191631/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|archivedate=July 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> starting in June 2009 with high-profile shows at the [[Sweden Rock]] and Metalway festivals, followed by a tour of Japan in the fall.

Immediately following his passing, the band, featuring the \"Thundersteel\" lineup, performed several previously-booked east coast shows and the \"70,000 Tons of Metal\" cruise ship gig without him. A new Riot compilation was released following the shows, and at the request of Mark's father, the name \"Riot\" was put to rest. However, some former members of the \"Thundersteel\"-era lineup began work putting together a new band performing music in the same vein as Riot.\n\n=== Second reunion as Riot V (2013\u2013present) ===\nThe band was officially re-launched as \"Riot V\", the name alluding to the addition of [[Todd Michael Hall]] as the fifth official singer, replacing Moore. Van Stavern revealed that Moore had chosen not to continue with the band to spend more time with his family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalsquadron.com/2014/10/21/the-fifth-chapter/|title=RIOT V: The fifth chapter|website=Metalsquadron.com|date=October 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Nick Lee, a former student at the guitar classes run by Flyntz, joined as the new co-lead guitarist for the band, replacing deceased Reale, and Frank Gilchriest rejoined the band in place of Jarzombek, who had quit the band to focus on his activities with [[Fates Warning]]. Their new album ''Unleash The Fire'' was released in Japan, under the name Riot, in August 2014. This is the band's first release since the death of Reale.\n\n[[Todd Michael Hall]] said about the \"V\" letter: \"The official name for the band is Riot V, but we do have this confusion with the Japanese release versus the European release. I was told that the Japanese record label considered the release to be a continuation of the previous contract with \"Riot\", so they did not want to use the V\".<ref name=\"RiotV-int 2014\">[http://www.grande-rock.com/interviews/riot-v Interview with Todd Michael Hall], Grande-rock.com retrieved on November 13, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Members ==\n=== Current ===\n* Mike Flyntz \u2013 lead guitar (1989\u20132012, 2013\u2013present)\n* Don Van Stavern \u2013 bass (1986\u20131990, 2008\u20132012, 2013\u2013present)\n* [[Todd Michael Hall]] \u2013 lead vocals (2013\u2013present)\n* Frank Gilchriest \u2013 drums (2003\u20132007, 2014\u2013present)\n* Nick Lee \u2013 rhythm guitar (2014\u2013present)\n\n=== Former===\n;Vocalists\n* [[Guy Speranza]] \u2013 lead vocals (1975\u20131981; died 2003)\n* [[Rhett Forrester]] \u2013 lead vocals (1981\u20131984, 1986; died 1994)\n* [[Tony Moore (singer)|Tony Moore]] \u2013 lead vocals (1986\u20131992, 2008\u20132009, 2010\u20132012)\n* [[Mike DiMeo]] \u2013 lead vocals (1992\u20132004)\n* Mike Tirelli \u2013 lead vocals (2005\u20132007)\n\n;Guitarists\n* [[Mark Reale]] \u2013 lead guitar (1975\u20131984, 1986\u20132012; died 2012)\n* Louie \"L.A.\" Kouvaris \u2013 rhythm guitar (1975\u20131978; died 2020)\n* Rick Ventura \u2013 rhythm guitar (1978\u20131984)\n\n;Bassists\n* Phil Feit \u2013 bass (1975\u20131976, 1979\u20131980)\n* Jimmy Iommi \u2013 bass (1976\u20131979)\n* Kip Leming \u2013 bass (1980\u20131984)\n* Pete Perez \u2013 bass (1990\u20132007)\n\n;Drummers\n* Peter Bitelli \u2013 drums (1975\u20131979)\n* Sandy Slavin \u2013 drums (1979\u20131984, 1986)\n* Mark Edwards \u2013 drums (1986\u20131987)\n* [[Bobby Jarzombek]] \u2013 drums (1987\u20131995, 1997\u20131999, 2008\u20132014)\n* [[John Macaluso]] \u2013 drums (1995\u20131997)\n* Pat Magrath \u2013 drums(1999\u20132000)\n* [[Bobby Rondinelli]] \u2013 drums (2000\u20132002)\n\n;Additional live musicians\n* Randy Coven \u2013 bass (2005\u20132007)\n* Gerard T.

Reaching a peak in popularity in the early 80s, the band has continued a long-running successful career.\n\nRiot has toured with [[AC/DC]], [[Molly Hatchet]], [[Sammy Hagar]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Vandenberg (band)|Vandenberg]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] among others.\n\nRiot's sound initially started out as straightforward heavy metal, but since their 1988 release ''[[Thundersteel]]'' their musical direction has been more along the lines of power metal.\n\nIn 2013, Riot V, a new iteration of the band was launched by the surviving members, after the death of founding member and band leader [[Mark Reale]].\n\nThe group usually uses a baby seal face as a logo on its album covers.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years (1975\u20131983)===\nRiot was formed in 1975 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] when [[Kon-Tiki]] guitarist [[Mark Reale]] and drummer Peter Bitelli recruited bassist Phil Feit and vocalist [[Guy Speranza]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who\u2019s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|pages=298/9}}</ref> The line up recorded a four-track demo, which they hoped would be included in a proposed compilation of new rock bands. While waiting for the project to get off the ground, they added Steve Costello on keyboards.\n\nReale took the various demos to New York-based producers Billy Arnell and Steve Loeb, who also owned [[Greene St. Recording|Greene Street Recording Studio]] and the independent label Fire-Sign Records. Arnell and Loeb turned down the compilation proposal but signed Riot. The band added second guitarist Louie Kouvaris and replaced Feit with Jimmy Iommi, though both bass players participated in the recording of its debut album, ''[[Rock City (Riot album)|Rock City]]''<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>; the record was recorded and produced by Arnell and Loeb and released on their Fire Sign Records.  After a promising start and support slots with [[AC/DC]] and [[Molly Hatchet]], the band were unable to maintain momentum and were on the verge of breaking up by 1979.\n\nIn that year, however, the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] broke mainstream, and the band came to the attention of influential DJ [[Neal Kay]] who spread the word about them in Britain where fans bought imported copies of ''Rock City''. Encouraged, Arnell and Loeb, now Riot's managers, recorded the band's new album ''[[Narita (album)|Narita]]''. In the course of recording, Kouvaris was replaced by roadie Rick Ventura .<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nSubsequent to a successful support of [[Sammy Hagar]] on his US Texas tour, [[Capitol Records]] offered Riot a worldwide deal for ''Narita,'' mostly to support Hagar. Capitol and Hagar needed a harder, younger edge to associate with him, so Riot was chosen if they agreed to support Hagar on his UK tour. Hagar and Riot had a successful tour, but Riot was dropped by Capitol as soon as they were finished promoting Hagar.\n\nArnell and Loeb spent the remaining Capitol Records advance while retaining important indie FM radio promotions to promote the last Riot album. Arnell and Loeb put the album on as many radio stations around the country as possible, thus raising the radio profile enough to where Capitol picked up their option for another record, which led to Riot's biggest selling album, ''[[Fire Down Under]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nWhen the record was completed some months later, Capitol turned the record down calling it \"commercially unacceptable\",{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} which put the band in contractual limbo. Capitol refused to release the band from the contract. A campaign was organized and financed by producers Arnell and Loeb, and engaging fans around the world. Fans picketed the offices of EMI Records, especially in the UK.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Finally, [[Elektra Records]] reached an agreement with Capitol Vice President [[Rupert Perry]] and immediately released ''Fire Down Under'', which then soared into the [[Billboard 200]] chart.\n\n===Breakup, the \"Reunion\" and Reale's death (1983\u20132012)===\nSinger [[Guy Speranza]] (March 12, 1956 \u2013 November 8, 2003) had difficulty melding his religious convictions with his role in the band and was replaced by [[Rhett Forrester]] (September 22, 1956 \u2013  January 22, 1994) for the next album, ''[[Restless Breed]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Though a striking frontman, any hope of a major breakthrough was sunk by a combination of Forrester's erratic behaviour on the road, a changing of the guard at Elektra, and the 1983 success of [[Quiet Riot]]'s cover of \"[[Cum on Feel the Noize]]\".  The next album, ''[[Born in America]]'', (1983) was self-financed by Steve Loeb and was released on [[Quality Records]], an independent Canadian label.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>  A note on the reverse of the album tried to explain away would-be fans' confusion between Riot and the now No.&nbsp;1-selling Quiet Riot, but support melted away, leading to the band's disintegration.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nReale relocated to San Antonio, Texas, where he recruited former [[S.A.Slayer]] members Steve Cooper, Don Van Stavern, and Dave McClain (now with [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]]) for a short-lived new band called Narita.  By 1986, Reale and Van Stavern had made their way out to Los Angeles in an attempt to resurrect Riot along with former members Sandy Slavin and Rhett Forrester.  Harry 'The Tyrant' Conklin ([[Jag Panzer]]) handled vocals for a short time but was dismissed after losing his voice on the second night of back-to-back gigs due to excessive drinking.  Eventually, Reale reunited with producer Steve Loeb and moved back to New York.  Drummer Mark Edwards ([[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]], Third Stage Alert) was recruited to complete the new rhythm section with bassist Don Van Stavern, while Greene Street Studio manager Dave Harrington brought in [[Tony Moore (singer)|Tony Moore]] (real name: Tony Morabito) on vocals.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Loeb cut a four-track demo at his Greene Street Studio in Soho, New York and along with real estate maven turned rock manager Vince Perazzo, brought the band to [[CBS]] Associated, who offered the band a worldwide deal. Edwards elected to leave the band as his own Los Angeles-based group [[Lion (band)|Lion]] was getting signed to Scotti Brothers. He was  superseded by San Antonio, Texas native [[Bobby Jarzombek]], formerly with [[Juggernaut (band)|Juggernaut]], who cut the rest of the drum tracks for what became the ''[[Thundersteel]]'' album, released in 1988.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> It was followed by the more experimental ''[[The Privilege of Power]]'' (1990),<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which saw the band augment their state-of-the-art heavy metal sound with horns, courtesy of the [[Brecker Brothers]] and [[Tower of Power]].  The album also featured a guest vocal appearance by [[Joe Lynn Turner]] of [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] fame.  Second guitarist Mike Flyntz joined the ranks for the band's 1989 ''[[Thundersteel]]'' tour of Japan where Riot maintained their strongest subsequent following. Along with hiring tour manager Joey Batts who toured with them through the U.S and Japan.  Bassist Don Van Stavern quit the band after the US leg of the ''Privilege of Power'' tour and was replaced by fellow Texan Pete Perez (ex-Karion).\n\nIn 1992, vocalist Tony Moore left the group over disagreements with manager/producer Steve Loeb. Reale recruited newcomer [[Mike DiMeo]], who had played with [[Howard Stern]] sidekick [[Stuttering John]] Melendez in a local band named Josie Sang, with a view toward making a more hard rock-oriented solo album. Eventually, those plans were dropped and the proposed solo effort turned into another Riot album, 1993's ''[[Nightbreaker]]'',<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> which featured a remake of the ''[[Fire Down Under]]'' track \"Outlaw\", as well as covers of [[Deep Purple]]'s \"[[Burn (Deep Purple song)|Burn]]\" and \"[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\" by [[Procol Harum]]. The following LP, the Native American-themed ''[[Brethren of the Long House]]'' (1996), which saw [[John Macaluso]] ([[TNT (Norwegian band)|TNT]], [[Powermad]]) briefly take over for Bobby Jarzombek on drums, marked the final collaboration with long-time associate Steve Loeb who stepped down from the production chair in 1995. All told, Loeb produced or co-produced 13 Riot albums in his 19-year association with Reale and the different configurations of Riot. For the rest of the decade Riot maintained a stable line-up for the first time in its history, resulting in a steady output of high-quality albums, i.e. ''[[Inishmore (album)|Inishmore]]'' (1998), ''[[Shine On (Riot album)|Shine On]]'' live (1998), and ''[[Sons of Society]]'' (1999).  Jarzombek left again in late 1999, this time to join former [[Judas Priest]] vocalist [[Rob Halford]] in his new venture [[Halford (band)|Halford]].  Pat Magrath (Prototype, Killing Culture) filled in for Jarzombek on the following European tour before being replaced by veteran skinsman [[Bobby Rondinelli]] (Rainbow, [[Black Sabbath]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]) with whom the band recorded ''[[Through the Storm (Riot album)|Through the Storm]]'' (2002).\n\nIn 2006, Riot returned with yet another album, ''[[Army of One (album)|Army of One]]'', featuring new addition Frank Gilchriest ([[Virgin Steele]], Gothic Knights) on drums. It marked the final album with vocalist [[Mike DiMeo]] who had earlier announced his departure in order to concentrate on his work with retro rockers The Lizards after a 12-year run with Riot.  DiMeo was succeeded by the New York area singer Mike Tirelli, whose Riot live debut came in early 2005 at the band's Atarfe Vega Rock Festival appearance in [[Granada]], Spain.\n\nRiot with Tirelli toured the United States for most of 2005, and made an appearance in Japan in both 2006 and 2007, and undertook an extensive tour of Spain in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, it was announced that the classic ''[[Thundersteel]]''-era line-up would reunite for a tour,<ref>{{cite web|title=Riot's 'Thundersteel' lineup to tour Europe in June|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191631/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111557|archivedate=July 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> starting in June 2009 with high-profile shows at the [[Sweden Rock]] and Metalway festivals, followed by a tour of Japan in the fall.

Immediately following his passing, the band, featuring the \"Thundersteel\" lineup, performed several previously-booked east coast shows and the \"70,000 Tons of Metal\" cruise ship gig without him. A new Riot compilation was released following the shows, and at the request of Mark's father, the name \"Riot\" was put to rest. However, some former members of the \"Thundersteel\"-era lineup began work putting together a new band performing music in the same vein as Riot.\n\n=== Second reunion as Riot V (2013\u2013present) ===\nThe band was officially re-launched as \"Riot V\", the name alluding to the addition of [[Todd Michael Hall]] as the fifth official singer, replacing Moore. Van Stavern revealed that Moore had chosen not to continue with the band to spend more time with his family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalsquadron.com/2014/10/21/the-fifth-chapter/|title=RIOT V: The fifth chapter|website=Metalsquadron.com|date=October 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Nick Lee, a former student at the guitar classes run by Flyntz, joined as the new co-lead guitarist for the band, replacing deceased Reale, and Frank Gilchriest rejoined the band in place of Jarzombek, who had quit the band to focus on his activities with [[Fates Warning]]. Their new album ''Unleash The Fire'' was released in Japan, under the name Riot, in August 2014. This is the band's first release since the death of Reale.\n\n[[Todd Michael Hall]] said about the \"V\" letter: \"The official name for the band is Riot V, but we do have this confusion with the Japanese release versus the European release. I was told that the Japanese record label considered the release to be a continuation of the previous contract with \"Riot\", so they did not want to use the V\".<ref name=\"RiotV-int 2014\">[http://www.grande-rock.com/interviews/riot-v Interview with Todd Michael Hall], Grande-rock.com retrieved on November 13, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Members ==\n=== Current ===\n* Mike Flyntz \u2013 lead guitar (1989\u20132012, 2013\u2013present)\n* Don Van Stavern \u2013 bass (1986\u20131990, 2008\u20132012, 2013\u2013present)\n* [[Todd Michael Hall]] \u2013 lead vocals (2013\u2013present)\n* Frank Gilchriest \u2013 drums (2003\u20132007, 2014\u2013present)\n* Nick Lee \u2013 rhythm guitar (2014\u2013present)\n\n=== Former===\n;Vocalists\n* [[Guy Speranza]] \u2013 lead vocals (1975\u20131981; died 2003)\n* [[Rhett Forrester]] \u2013 lead vocals (1981\u20131984, 1986; died 1994)\n* [[Tony Moore (singer)|Tony Moore]] \u2013 lead vocals (1986\u20131992, 2008\u20132009, 2010\u20132012)\n* [[Mike DiMeo]] \u2013 lead vocals (1992\u20132004)\n* Mike Tirelli \u2013 lead vocals (2005\u20132007)\n\n;Guitarists\n* [[Mark Reale]] \u2013 lead guitar (1975\u20131984, 1986\u20132012; died 2012)\n* Louie \"L.A.\" Kouvaris \u2013 rhythm guitar (1975\u20131978; died 2020)\n* Rick Ventura \u2013 rhythm guitar (1978\u20131984)\n\n;Bassists\n* Phil Feit \u2013 bass (1975\u20131976, 1979\u20131980)\n* Jimmy Iommi \u2013 bass (1976\u20131979)\n* Kip Leming \u2013 bass (1980\u20131984)\n* Pete Perez \u2013 bass (1990\u20132007)\n\n;Drummers\n* Peter Bitelli \u2013 drums (1975\u20131979)\n* Sandy Slavin \u2013 drums (1979\u20131984, 1986)\n* Mark Edwards \u2013 drums (1986\u20131987)\n* [[Bobby Jarzombek]] \u2013 drums (1987\u20131995, 1997\u20131999, 2008\u20132014)\n* [[John Macaluso]] \u2013 drums (1995\u20131997)\n* Pat Magrath \u2013 drums(1999\u20132000)\n* [[Bobby Rondinelli]] \u2013 drums (2000\u20132002)\n\n;Additional live musicians\n* Randy Coven \u2013 bass (2005\u20132007)\n* Gerard T.

At school he was known as a talented artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography: Shaun Tan|url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/shaun-tan|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> At the age of eleven, he became a fan of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' television series as well as books that bore similar themes. Tan cites [[Ray Bradbury]] as a favorite at this time. These stories led to Tan writing his own short stories. Of his effort at writing as a youth, Tan tells, \"I have a small pile of rejection letters as testament to this ambition!\"<ref name=\"locusmag\">{{cite journal |title=Shaun Tan: Out of Context |first=Karen |last=Haber |journal=Locus |issue=12 |date=December 2001 |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2001/Issue12/Tan.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> At the age of sixteen, Tan's first illustration appeared in the Australian magazine ''[[Aurealis]]'' in 1990.<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\n===Transition to illustration===\nTan almost studied to become a geneticist, and enjoyed chemistry, physics, history and English while in high school as well as art and claimed that he did not really know what he wanted to do.<ref name= \"locusmag\" /> During his university studies, Tan decided to move from academic studies to working as an artist.<ref name=\"hsc\">{{Citation | title = Visual arts requirements case studies | contribution = Shaun Tan | contribution-url = http://hsc.csu.edu.au/visual_arts/requirements/case_studies/illustrator_graphic_designer/122232ShaTanCDoc5.html | publisher = NSW HSC Online}}.</ref>\n\nTan continued his education at the [[University of Western Australia]] where he studied Fine Arts, English Literature and History. While this was of interest to him, there was little practical work involved.<ref name =\"hsc\" /> In 1995, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.austlit.edu.au/run?ex=ShowAgent&agentId=A%2C%7D9 | publisher = AustLit | title = Agent}}.</ref>\n\n===Work process===\nInitially, Tan works in black and white because the final reproductions would be printed that way. Some black and white mediums he uses include pens, inks, acrylics, charcoal, scraperboard, photocopies, and linocuts.<ref name=\"locusmag\" /> Tan's current colour works still begin in black and white. He uses a graphite pencil to make sketches on ordinary copy paper. The sketches are then reproduced numerous times with different versions varying with parts added or removed. Sometimes scissors are used for this purpose. The cut and paste [[collage]] idea in these early stages is often extend to the finished production with many of his illustrations using such materials as \"glass, metal, cuttings from other books and dead insects\".<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\nTan describes himself as a slow worker who revises his work many times along the way. He is interested in loss and alienation, and believes that children in particular react well to issues of natural justice. He feels he is \"like a translator\" of ideas, and is happy and flattered to see his work adapted and interpreted in film and music (such as by the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]]).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/stories/2008/2258905.htm|title=Shaun Tan: ''Tales from Outer Suburbia''|publisher=[[ABC Radio National]]|work=[[The Book Show]]|date=29 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nTan draws from a large source of inspiration and cites many influences on his work.

He won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[The Lost Thing]]'', a 2011 animated film adaptation of a 2000 picture book he wrote and illustrated. Other books he has written and illustrated include ''[[The Red Tree (Shaun Tan)|The Red Tree]]'' and ''[[The Arrival (graphic novel)|The Arrival]]''.\n\nTan was born in [[Fremantle]], Western Australia, and grew up in the northern suburbs of [[Perth]], Western Australia. In 2006, his wordless [[graphic novel]] ''The Arrival'' won the Book of the Year prize as part of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]].<ref>{{Citation|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald| url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/2007-nsw-premiers-literary-awards/2007/05/29/1180205249745.html | title = 2007 NSW Premier's Literary Awards | date = 30 May 2007}}</ref> The same book won the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]] [[Children's Book of the Year Award: Picture Book|Picture Book of the Year]] award in 2007.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://cbc.org.au/winner07.htm | publisher = CBCA | title = Book of the Year Awards | contribution = Winners 2007}}.</ref> and the [[Western Australian Premier's Book Awards]] Premier's Prize in 2006.<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Shaun Tan | contribution-url = http://pba.slwa.wa.gov.au/hall_of_fame/shaun_tan | title = Premier's Book Awards Hall of Fame | publisher = [[State Library of Western Australia]]}}.</ref>\n\nTan's work has been described as an \"Australian vernacular\" that is \"at once banal and uncanny, familiar and strange, local and universal, reassuring and scary, intimate and remote, [[Street children|guttersnipe]] and [[sprezzatura]].

At school he was known as a talented artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography: Shaun Tan|url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/shaun-tan|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> At the age of eleven, he became a fan of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' television series as well as books that bore similar themes. Tan cites [[Ray Bradbury]] as a favorite at this time. These stories led to Tan writing his own short stories. Of his effort at writing as a youth, Tan tells, \"I have a small pile of rejection letters as testament to this ambition!\"<ref name=\"locusmag\">{{cite journal |title=Shaun Tan: Out of Context |first=Karen |last=Haber |journal=Locus |issue=12 |date=December 2001 |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2001/Issue12/Tan.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> At the age of sixteen, Tan's first illustration appeared in the Australian magazine ''[[Aurealis]]'' in 1990.<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\n===Transition to illustration===\nTan almost studied to become a geneticist, and enjoyed chemistry, physics, history and English while in high school as well as art and claimed that he did not really know what he wanted to do.<ref name= \"locusmag\" /> During his university studies, Tan decided to move from academic studies to working as an artist.<ref name=\"hsc\">{{Citation | title = Visual arts requirements case studies | contribution = Shaun Tan | contribution-url = http://hsc.csu.edu.au/visual_arts/requirements/case_studies/illustrator_graphic_designer/122232ShaTanCDoc5.html | publisher = NSW HSC Online}}.</ref>\n\nTan continued his education at the [[University of Western Australia]] where he studied Fine Arts, English Literature and History. While this was of interest to him, there was little practical work involved.<ref name =\"hsc\" /> In 1995, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.austlit.edu.au/run?ex=ShowAgent&agentId=A%2C%7D9 | publisher = AustLit | title = Agent}}.</ref>\n\n===Work process===\nInitially, Tan works in black and white because the final reproductions would be printed that way. Some black and white mediums he uses include pens, inks, acrylics, charcoal, scraperboard, photocopies, and linocuts.<ref name=\"locusmag\" /> Tan's current colour works still begin in black and white. He uses a graphite pencil to make sketches on ordinary copy paper. The sketches are then reproduced numerous times with different versions varying with parts added or removed. Sometimes scissors are used for this purpose. The cut and paste [[collage]] idea in these early stages is often extend to the finished production with many of his illustrations using such materials as \"glass, metal, cuttings from other books and dead insects\".<ref name=\"locusmag\" />\n\nTan describes himself as a slow worker who revises his work many times along the way. He is interested in loss and alienation, and believes that children in particular react well to issues of natural justice. He feels he is \"like a translator\" of ideas, and is happy and flattered to see his work adapted and interpreted in film and music (such as by the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]]).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/stories/2008/2258905.htm|title=Shaun Tan: ''Tales from Outer Suburbia''|publisher=[[ABC Radio National]]|work=[[The Book Show]]|date=29 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nTan draws from a large source of inspiration and cites many influences on his work. His comment on the subject is: \"I\u2019m pretty omnivorous when it comes to influences, and I like to admit this openly.\"<ref name = \"locusmag\" /> Some influences are very direct.

It received its name from [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] consul and victor of the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] who negotiated it with a subordinate of [[Hamilcar Barca]] in 241 BC. According to the historian [[Polybius]], the terms of the accord dictated that [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] must evacuate [[Sicily]], not make war upon [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] or its allies, hand over all prisoners taken during the war, and pay an indemnity of 2200 [[talent (weight)|talents]] (66 tons) of silver in 20 annual installments. Originally rejected by the Roman people, these terms were eventually adopted with very little change under the authority of Quintus Lutatius Cerco, the brother of Gaius Lutatius Catulus. In the final agreement, Carthage was only given ten years to pay an indemnity of 3200 talents (96 tons), and had to evacuate the islands between [[Sicily]] and [[Italy]] ([[Ustica]] and the [[Aeolian Islands]]) and [[Aegadian Islands]] off western coast of Sicily.\n\n==Sources==\n\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa|188}} BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the end of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the treaty in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war and the treaty that ended it exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians usually also take into account the histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\n== First Punic War ==\n\nThe [[Roman Republic]] had been [[Roman expansion in Italy|aggressively expanding]] in the southern Italian mainland for a century before the First Punic War.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=157\u2013158}} It had conquered peninsular Italy south of the River [[Arno]] by 272 BC.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=21\u201322}} During this period [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], with its capital in what is now [[Tunisia]], had come to dominate southern [[Spain]], much of the coastal regions of North Africa, the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], and the western half of [[Sicily]] in a military and commercial empire.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=29\u201330}} In 264 BC Carthage and Rome were the preeminent powers in the western Mediterranean.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=25\u201326}} The two states had several times asserted their mutual friendship via [[Treaties between Rome and Carthage|formal alliances]]: in 509 BC, 348 BC and around 279 BC.

According to the historian [[Polybius]], the terms of the accord dictated that [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] must evacuate [[Sicily]], not make war upon [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] or its allies, hand over all prisoners taken during the war, and pay an indemnity of 2200 [[talent (weight)|talents]] (66 tons) of silver in 20 annual installments. Originally rejected by the Roman people, these terms were eventually adopted with very little change under the authority of Quintus Lutatius Cerco, the brother of Gaius Lutatius Catulus. In the final agreement, Carthage was only given ten years to pay an indemnity of 3200 talents (96 tons), and had to evacuate the islands between [[Sicily]] and [[Italy]] ([[Ustica]] and the [[Aeolian Islands]]) and [[Aegadian Islands]] off western coast of Sicily.\n\n===Sardinia and Corsica===\n\nAfter Carthage evacuated its 20,000 strong army from Sicily to North Africa it became embroiled with the troops in a pay dispute. Eventually the troops mutinied and turned against Carthage. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion; some were freshly conquered and all had been harshly oppressed in order to finance the recently ended war. They added 70,000 men to the rebel force and supplied finance and food. Rome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles and adhered to the terms of the recent treaty. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on [[Sardinia]] joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island.

Sicily became the first [[Roman province]] as [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]], governed by a former [[praetor]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. Carthage was not reconciled to this situation, and when Carthage besieged the Roman-protected town of [[Saguntum]] in eastern Iberia in 218 BC, it ignited the [[Second Punic War]] with Rome.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\n==Notes, citations and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note|30em}}\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Nigel |date=1999 |title=The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage and the Struggle for the Mediterranean |url={{Google Books|W9u9mCSV4AgC|plainurl=y}} |location=London |publisher=Pimlico |page= |isbn=978-0-7126-6608-4 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Bringmann|first=Klaus|title=A History of the Roman Republic|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|publisher=Polity Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7456-3370-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftlpza5l9R4C|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book |url={{Google Books|sDpMh0gK2OUC|plainurl=y}} |title=Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World |first=Lionel|last= Casson  |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8018-5130-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Spain: An Oxford Archaeological Guide|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-285300-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Trj8L8rPVRcC|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =65\n| issue =1\n| pages =32\u201337\n| last =Curry\n| first =Anne\n| title =The Weapon That Changed History\n| journal =Archaeology\n| date =2012\n| jstor =41780760\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Goldsworthy|title=The Fall of Carthage: The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-0-304-36642-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsnFSQAACAAJ|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Hau\n|first=Lisa\n|date=2016\n|title=Moral History from Herodotus to Diodorus Siculus\n|url=\n|location=Edinburgh\n|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|page=\n|isbn=978-1-4744-1107-3\n|author-link=\n\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =143\n| issue =3/4\n| pages =369\u2013380 \n|first=Dexter\n|last=Hoyos\n|date=2000\n| title =Towards a Chronology of the 'Truceless War', 241\u2013237 B.

Eventually the troops mutinied and turned against Carthage. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion; some were freshly conquered and all had been harshly oppressed in order to finance the recently ended war. They added 70,000 men to the rebel force and supplied finance and food. Rome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles and adhered to the terms of the recent treaty. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on [[Sardinia]] joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor.

Sicily became the first [[Roman province]] as [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]], governed by a former [[praetor]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.

The second film starring the Beatles following Lester's ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', ''Help!'' sees the group struggle to record their new album while trying to protect Starr from a sinister [[cult]] and a pair of mad scientists, all of whom are obsessed with obtaining one of his rings.<ref name=\"Beatles.com\">{{cite web|title=Help!|url=http://www.beatles.com/#/films/Help|publisher=Beatles.com|accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> The soundtrack was released as an album, also called ''[[Help!]]''.\n\nThe film had its Royal World Premiere at the [[London Pavilion]] Theatre in the [[West End of London]] on 29 July 1965 in the presence of [[Princess Margaret]], Countess of Snowdon and the [[Antony Charles Robert Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Earl of Snowdon]]. While not reviewed at the time with the same high level of admiration as their first film, the film is regarded a half century later as being influential, including in the subsequent development of  [[music videos]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:The Beatles Trailer USHelp.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|Screenshot of [[the Beatles]] in ''Help!'']]\nAn [[Eastern world|eastern]] [[cult]] (a parody of the [[Thuggee]] cult) is about to sacrifice a woman to the [[goddess]] [[Kali|Kali]]. They notice that she is not wearing the sacrificial ring. Instead, [[Ringo Starr]], drummer of the Beatles, has the ring, sent to him by the victim and her high priestess sister, who are both fans of the Beatles. Determined to retrieve the ring and sacrifice the girl, the great Swami, several cult members and the high priestess leave for London. After failed attempts to steal the ring without Ringo noticing, they confront him in an Indian restaurant. Ringo learns that if he be the next sacrifice if he does not give up the ring. However, the ring is stuck and he cannot take it off. The Beatles are chased around London by members of the cult. In a desperate effort to dispose of the ring, the band resorts to the bumbling efforts of a mad scientist and his assistant; when his equipment turns out to have no effect on the ring, the scientist decides that he, too, must somehow acquire it. The band runs to the Swiss Alps and narrowly escapes a trap there, thanks to the help of the high priestess, who is secretly aiding the Beatles. To stay safe, they ask for protection from Scotland Yard.  They hide in Buckingham Palace, narrowly avoiding capture by the scientist. The band runs to the Bahamas, followed by the police officers, the scientist, and the cult members. After Ringo is nearly captured, the other Beatles pose as him in order to lure out the cult members to be arrested by the police. Despite their best efforts, however, Ringo is captured by the scientist, who intends on cutting off his finger to get the ring.  The high priestess rescues Ringo by giving the scientist a shrinking solution in exchange.  The two of them dive into the ocean to escape, but Ringo cannot swim and they are both captured by the great Swami. In the end, when Ringo is about to be sacrificed, the ring suddenly comes off. He puts the ring on the great Swami who is then chased by his own cult.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[John Lennon]]     as himself \n*[[Paul McCartney]]  as himself\n*[[George Harrison]] as himself\n*[[Ringo Starr]]     as himself\n*[[Eleanor Bron]]    as Ahme\n*[[Leo McKern]]      as Clang\n*[[John Bluthal]]    as Bhuta\n*[[Patrick Cargill]] as Superintendent Gluck\n*[[Victor Spinetti]] as Foot\n*[[Roy Kinnear]]     as Algernon\n*[[Alfie Bass]]      as Doorman\n*[[Warren Mitchell]] as Abdul\n*[[Peter Copley]] as Jeweler\n*[[Bruce Lacey]] as Lawnmower\n*Durra as Belly Dancer\n*[[Mal Evans]]       as Channel Swimmer (uncredited)\n*[[Gretchen Franklin]] as Neighbor (uncredited)\n*[[Dandy Nichols]] as Neighbor (uncredited)\n*[[Jeremy Lloyd]] as Restaurant Patron (uncredited)\n*[[John Louis Mansi]] as Priest / Thug\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAccording to interviews conducted with [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Ringo Starr]] for ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', director Richard Lester was given a larger budget for this film than he had for ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', thanks to the commercial success of the latter. Thus, this feature film was in colour and was shot on several exotic foreign locations. It was also given a more extensive musical score than ''A Hard Day's Night'', provided by a full orchestra, and including pieces of well known classical music: [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', Act III Overture, [[Tchaikovsky]]'s \"[[1812 Overture]]\", [[Beethoven]]'s \"[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]\" (\"Ode to Joy\"), and, during the end credits and with their own comic vocal interpretation, [[Rossini]]'s \"[[The Barber of Seville|Barber of Seville]]\" overture. The original title for the film \u2013 only changed to ''Help!'' very near to its release \u2013 was ''Eight Arms To Hold You.''<ref>Matthews, Brian.\"Part 7,\" ''The Beatles Story'' (BBC, 1973).</ref>\n\n''Help!'' was shot in London, [[Salisbury Plain]], the [[Austria]]n [[Alps]], [[New Providence Island]] and [[Paradise Island]] in the Bahamas and [[Twickenham Film Studios]], beginning in the Bahamas on 23 February 1965. Starr commented in ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' that they were in the Bahamas for the hot weather scenes, and therefore had to wear light clothing even though it was rather cold. Tony Bramwell, the assistant to Beatles manager Brian Epstein, stated in his book ''A Magical Mystery Tour'' that Epstein chose the Bahamas for tax reasons. According to ''The Beatles Anthology'', during the restaurant sequence filmed in early April, George began to discover [[India]]n-style music, which would be a key element in future songs such as [[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|\"Norwegian Wood\"]]. Filming finished on 14 April at Ailsa Avenue in [[Twickenham]].\n\nThe ski scenes were shot at [[Obertauern]], a small village in Austria. One reason this location was chosen was that the stars of the film were less likely to be recognized there than at one of the larger resorts with many British tourists. The Beatles were in Obertauern for about two weeks in March 1965 along with a film crew of around 60 people. Locals served as ski stunt doubles for the Beatles who stayed at the hotel \"Edelweiss\". Most of the crew were based in the hotel \"Marieta\", where one night the Beatles gave an impromptu concert on the occasion of a director's assistant's birthday. This was the only time they ever played on stage in Austria.<ref name=FAS>{{cite news | last =  Kast| first = G\u00fcnter| author2 = | title = Hi-Hi-Hilfe! | newspaper = Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung | location = Travel Section | pages = 4 | language = German | publisher = | date = 4 January 2015 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nThe Beatles did not particularly enjoy the filming ''Help!'', nor were they pleased with the end product. In 1970, [[John Lennon]] said they felt like extras in their own film.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Beatles with Eleanor Bron.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Beatles with costar Eleanor Bron.]] -->\n{{quote|text=The film was out of our control. With ''A Hard Day's Night'', we had a lot of input, and it was semi-realistic. But with ''Help!'', Dick Lester didn't tell us what it was all about. |sign=John Lennon on filming ''Help!''}}\n\nTen years later Lennon was more charitable:<ref>Sheff, David.  ''All We Are Saying''. 2000, St Martin's Griffin, {{ISBN|0-312-25464-4}}, p. 176</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=I realize, looking back, how advanced it was. It was a precursor to the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] \"Pow!  Wow!\" on TV\u2014that kind of stuff. But [Lester] never explained it to us. Partly, maybe, because we hadn't spent a lot of time together between ''A Hard Day's Night'' and ''Help!'', and partly because we were smoking marijuana for breakfast during that period. Nobody could communicate with us, it was all glazed eyes and giggling all the time. In our own world. It's like doing nothing most of the time, but still having to rise at 7&nbsp;am, so we became bored.}}\n\nA contributing factor was exhaustion attributable to their busy schedule of writing, recording and touring. Afterward they were hesitant to begin another film project, and indeed ''Help!'' was their last full-length scripted theatrical film. Their obligation for a third film to United Artists was met by the 1970 documentary film [[Let It Be (film)|''Let It Be'']]. The 1968 animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' did not meet contractual obligations because it did not star the Beatles, and their only live appearance was featured for less than two minutes at the film's conclusion.\n\n===Inspiration===\nThe Beatles said the film was inspired by the classic [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'';<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRpqWHwLZNoC&pg=PT377 |title=Shout!: The Beatles in Their Generation |page=1377 |isbn=0-7432-5378-7 |year=2011 |last=Norman |first=Phillip |publisher=Simon and Schuster |accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref> it was also directly satirical of the [[James Bond]] series of films.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8Ob1bL_ongC&pg=PA102 |page=102 |title=Reading the Beatles: Cultural Studies, Literary Criticism, and the Fab Four |year=2012 |last=Womack |first=Kenneth |author2=Davis, Todd F |isbn=0-7914-8196-4 |publisher=SUNY Press |accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref> At the time of the original release of ''Help!'', its distributor, [[United Artists]], also held the rights to the Bond series.\n\nThe humour of the film is strongly influenced by the abstract humour of ''[[The Goon Show]]'', in which the director had personal and direct experience in the conversion of the radio format to television, and personal working experience with [[Peter Sellers]] in particular.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HESlHkg_pRoC&pg=PA54 |title=John Lennon Imagined: Cultural History of a Rock Star |page=54 |isbn=0-8204-6788-X |year=2004 |last=M\u00e4kel\u00e4 |first=Janne |publisher=Peter Lang |accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref> Beatles recording producer [[George Martin]] had also produced records for the ''Goon Show'' team. McCartney has always said that the Beatles style of humour was taken from the ''Goon Show''. Many of the film's concepts are derived from ''Goon Show''s, such as the presence of wild animals, music, [[fourth wall]]-breaking jokes and abstractions such as the closing statement that concludes the film.\n\n===Working title===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nThe original working title for the film was ''Eight Arms to Hold You''. This title was printed on the single \"Ticket to Ride\" as an upcoming film. Because of this, the phrase has been used as a title for an album by [[Veruca Salt]] and for songs by [[The Goonies]] and by the Brittles, a Beatles-pastiche band.\n\nThe Lennon-McCartney composition \"[[Eight Days a Week]]\" was briefly considered as a potential theme song for the film, but the idea was scrapped and the song was instead recorded and issued as an album track on ''[[Beatles for Sale]]'', as well as a single in the United States.\n\n===\"Haze of marijuana\"===\nThe Beatles later said the film was shot in a \"haze of marijuana\". According to Starr's interviews in ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', during the Austrian Alps film shooting, he and McCartney ran off over the hill from the \"[[curling]]\" scene set to smoke a joint.\n{{quote|text=A hell of a lot of pot was being smoked while we were making the film. It was great. That helped make it a lot of fun&nbsp;... In one of the scenes, Victor Spinetti and Roy Kinnear are playing curling: sliding along those big stones. One of the stones has a bomb in it and we find out that it's going to blow up, and have to run away. Well, Paul and I ran about seven miles, we ran and ran, just so we could stop and have a joint before we came back. We could have run all the way to Switzerland. If you look at pictures of us you can see a lot of red-eyed shots; they were red from the dope we were smoking. And these were those clean-cut boys! Dick Lester knew that very little would get done after lunch. In the afternoon we very seldom got past the first line of the script. We had such hysterics that no one could do anything. Dick Lester would say, \"No, boys, could we do it again?\" It was just that we had a lot of fun \u2013 a lot of fun in those days.|sign=Ringo Starr}}\n\nIn the ''Beatles Anthology Director's Cut'', Harrison admitted that they were smoking marijuana on the plane ride all the way to the Bahamas.\n\nMcCartney also shared some of his memories of when they were filming ''Help!'':\n\n{{quote|text=We showed up a bit stoned, smiled a lot and hoped we'd get through it. We giggled a lot. I remember one time at Cliveden (Lord Astor's place, where the [[Profumo affair|Christine Keeler/Profumo scandal]] went on); we were filming the [[Buckingham Palace]] scene where we were all supposed to have our hands up. It was after lunch, which was fatal because someone might have brought out a glass of wine as well. We were all a bit merry and all had our backs to the camera and the giggles set in. All we had to do was turn around and look amazed, or something. But every time we'd turn round to the camera there were tears streaming down our faces. It's OK to get the giggles anywhere else but in films, because the technicians get pissed off with you. They think, \"They're not very professional.\" Then you start thinking, \"This isn't very professional \u2013 but we're having a great laugh.\"|sign=Paul McCartney}}\n\n{{quote|text=John did once offer me a joint. And I obligingly tried to take a little puff. I knew there was some special way of doing it \u2013 but I don't smoke anyway. So I took a little puff and then thought, \"This is so expensive. I mustn't waste it!\"  And gave it back to him. So that's your definition of na\u00efve, I think.|sign=Eleanor Bron}}\n\nThe photographer [[Michael Peto]] was commissioned in 1965 to take still photographs during the making of the film; these became known for their candid and expressive quality.

The second side consisted of other new Beatles songs recorded at the same time or shortly afterwards. The US album, released by Capitol Records, includes the seven film tracks along with instrumental soundtrack songs orchestrated by Ken Thorne.  In addition, the US soundtrack leads off with a hidden track stylized as a satirical \"James Bond Theme\" before the title track, \"Help!\".  Early pressings of the US version of the album ''[[1962\u20131966]]'' include this hidden track banded as \"Help!\", and later pressings, when the UK catalogue was made the official and only catalogue of Beatles albums, omit it.\n\n==Critical response==\nCritical opinion at the time of release was generally positive, but many critics feel that this big budget effort was not as strong as ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. [[Leslie Halliwell]] describes it as an {{quote|text=[e]xhausting attempt to outdo ''A Hard Day's Night'' in lunatic frenzy, which goes to show that some talents work best on low budgets.

However, the sequence was left in the film novelisation.\n\n==Release history==\nLike ''A Hard Day's Night'', ''Help!'' was originally distributed theatrically by [[United Artists]] \u2013 the company handled distribution from 1965 to the end of 1980. In January 1981, rights to the film reverted from UA to producer Walter Shenson, and the film was withdrawn from circulation.\n\n''Help!'' was released several times in different video formats by MPI Home Video and [[The Criterion Collection]]. A version was released in February 1987 in VHS and Beta through MPI, along with a reissue of ''A Hard Day's Night'' the very same day, and was followed by a special-edition release on 31 October 1995. MPI also issued a CLV laserdisc in 1995 and two releases on DVD, the first as a single DVD release on 12 November 1997 and the second as part of ''The Beatles DVD Collector's Set'' on 8 August 2000.\n\nLaserDisc releases include a Criterion CAV laserdisc and a Voyager CLV laserdisc in 1987, each of which had three pressings. The first pressings had no [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] on the gatefold covers while the other two had the UPC either as a sticker or printed directly on the jacket.\n\nThe film's transfer on the CAV laserdiscs was done correctly so that no blending of frames occurs and thus movements are not blurry. The supplemental section, which, with few exceptions, has never been available on any other home video release, contains the following:\n* original theatrical trailer (which includes deleted scenes)\n* silent home film footage of the film set and of the world premiere\n* still photos, some of which are introduced by text describing the production history of the film\n* posters\n* sheet music\n* record jackets\n* radio ads (on audio during the silent footage)\n* an open interview, originally designed for disc jockeys. By reading prompts on the screen, one can pretend to talk to the Beatles.\n\nIn June 2007, a version of ''Help!'', sub-titled in Korean, became available on Amazon.com. However, by July 2007, all home video versions of the film were pulled from the market because of rights issues involving Apple Corps \u2013 now the full rights holders to the film. The rights issues were eventually resolved and Apple Corps/EMI/Capitol released a new double DVD version with a fully restored image and newly remixed in 2.0 stereo and [[5.1]] [[surround]] sound of the film. This came in standard 2xDVD packaging and 2xDVD deluxe edition box set on 30 October 2007 in the UK and 6 November 2007 in America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2007/press60.htm |title=Stop worrying&nbsp;...

The second film starring the Beatles following Lester's ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', ''Help!'' sees the group struggle to record their new album while trying to protect Starr from a sinister [[cult]] and a pair of mad scientists, all of whom are obsessed with obtaining one of his rings.<ref name=\"Beatles.com\">{{cite web|title=Help!|url=http://www.beatles.com/#/films/Help|publisher=Beatles.com|accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> The soundtrack was released as an album, also called ''[[Help!]]''.\n\nThe film had its Royal World Premiere at the [[London Pavilion]] Theatre in the [[West End of London]] on 29 July 1965 in the presence of [[Princess Margaret]], Countess of Snowdon and the [[Antony Charles Robert Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Earl of Snowdon]]. While not reviewed at the time with the same high level of admiration as their first film, the film is regarded a half century later as being influential, including in the subsequent development of  [[music videos]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:The Beatles Trailer USHelp.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|Screenshot of [[the Beatles]] in ''Help!'']]\nAn [[Eastern world|eastern]] [[cult]] (a parody of the [[Thuggee]] cult) is about to sacrifice a woman to the [[goddess]] [[Kali|Kali]]. They notice that she is not wearing the sacrificial ring. Instead, [[Ringo Starr]], drummer of the Beatles, has the ring, sent to him by the victim and her high priestess sister, who are both fans of the Beatles. Determined to retrieve the ring and sacrifice the girl, the great Swami, several cult members and the high priestess leave for London. After failed attempts to steal the ring without Ringo noticing, they confront him in an Indian restarant. Ringo learns that if he be the next sacrifice if he does not give up the ring. However, the ring is stuck and he cannot take it off. The Beatles are chased around London by members of the cult. In a desperate effort to dispose of the ring, the band resorts to the bumbling efforts of a mad scientist and his assistant; when his equipment turns out to have no effect on the ring, the scientist decides that he, too, must somehow acquire it. The band runs to the Swiss Alps and narrowly escapes a trap there, thanks to the help of the high priestess, who is secretly aiding the Beatles. To stay safe, they ask for protection from Scotland Yard.  They hide in Buckingham Palace, narrowly avoiding capture by the scientist. The band runs to the Bahamas, followed by the police officers, the scientist, and the cult members. After Ringo is nearly captured, the other Beatles pose as him in order to lure out the cult members to be arrested by the police. Despite their best efforts, however, Ringo is captured by the scientist, who intends on cutting off his finger to get the ring.  The high priestess rescues Ringo by giving the scientist a shrinking solution in exchange.  The two of them dive into the ocean to escape, but Ringo cannot swim and they are both captured by the great Swami. In the end, when Ringo is about to be sacrificed, the ring suddenly comes off. He puts the ring on the great Swami who is then chased by his own cult.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[John Lennon]]     as himself \n*[[Paul McCartney]]  as himself\n*[[George Harrison]] as himself\n*[[Ringo Starr]]     as himself\n*[[Eleanor Bron]]    as Ahme\n*[[Leo McKern]]      as Clang\n*[[John Bluthal]]    as Bhuta\n*[[Patrick Cargill]] as Superintendent Gluck\n*[[Victor Spinetti]] as Foot\n*[[Roy Kinnear]]     as Algernon\n*[[Alfie Bass]]      as Doorman\n*[[Warren Mitchell]] as Abdul\n*[[Peter Copley]] as Jeweler\n*[[Bruce Lacey]] as Lawnmower\n*Durra as Belly Dancer\n*[[Mal Evans]]       as Channel Swimmer (uncredited)\n*[[Gretchen Franklin]] as Neighbor (uncredited)\n*[[Dandy Nichols]] as Neighbor (uncredited)\n*[[Jeremy Lloyd]] as Restaurant Patron (uncredited)\n*[[John Louis Mansi]] as Priest / Thug\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAccording to interviews conducted with [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Ringo Starr]] for ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', director Richard Lester was given a larger budget for this film than he had for ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', thanks to the commercial success of the latter. Thus, this feature film was in colour and was shot on several exotic foreign locations. It was also given a more extensive musical score than ''A Hard Day's Night'', provided by a full orchestra, and including pieces of well known classical music: [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', Act III Overture, [[Tchaikovsky]]'s \"[[1812 Overture]]\", [[Beethoven]]'s \"[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]\" (\"Ode to Joy\"), and, during the end credits and with their own comic vocal interpretation, [[Rossini]]'s \"[[The Barber of Seville|Barber of Seville]]\" overture. The original title for the film \u2013 only changed to ''Help!'' very near to its release \u2013 was ''Eight Arms To Hold You.''<ref>Matthews, Brian.\"Part 7,\" ''The Beatles Story'' (BBC, 1973).</ref>\n\n''Help!'' was shot in London, [[Salisbury Plain]], the [[Austria]]n [[Alps]], [[New Providence Island]] and [[Paradise Island]] in the Bahamas and [[Twickenham Film Studios]], beginning in the Bahamas on 23 February 1965. Starr commented in ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' that they were in the Bahamas for the hot weather scenes, and therefore had to wear light clothing even though it was rather cold. Tony Bramwell, the assistant to Beatles manager Brian Epstein, stated in his book ''A Magical Mystery Tour'' that Epstein chose the Bahamas for tax reasons. According to ''The Beatles Anthology'', during the restaurant sequence filmed in early April, George began to discover [[India]]n-style music, which would be a key element in future songs such as [[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|\"Norwegian Wood\"]]. Filming finished on 14 April at Ailsa Avenue in [[Twickenham]].\n\nThe ski scenes were shot at [[Obertauern]], a small village in Austria. One reason this location was chosen was that the stars of the film were less likely to be recognized there than at one of the larger resorts with many British tourists. The Beatles were in Obertauern for about two weeks in March 1965 along with a film crew of around 60 people. Locals served as ski stunt doubles for the Beatles who stayed at the hotel \"Edelweiss\". Most of the crew were based in the hotel \"Marieta\", where one night the Beatles gave an impromptu concert on the occasion of a director's assistant's birthday. This was the only time they ever played on stage in Austria.<ref name=FAS>{{cite news | last =  Kast| first = G\u00fcnter| author2 = | title = Hi-Hi-Hilfe! | newspaper = Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung | location = Travel Section | pages = 4 | language = German | publisher = | date = 4 January 2015 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nThe Beatles did not particularly enjoy the filming ''Help!'', nor were they pleased with the end product. In 1970, [[John Lennon]] said they felt like extras in their own film.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Beatles with Eleanor Bron.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Beatles with costar Eleanor Bron.]] -->\n{{quote|text=The film was out of our control. With ''A Hard Day's Night'', we had a lot of input, and it was semi-realistic.

''All We Are Saying''. 2000, St Martin's Griffin, {{ISBN|0-312-25464-4}}, p. 176</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=I realize, looking back, how advanced it was. It was a precursor to the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] \"Pow!  Wow!\" on TV\u2014that kind of stuff. But [Lester] never explained it to us. Partly, maybe, because we hadn't spent a lot of time together between ''A Hard Day's Night'' and ''Help!'', and partly because we were smoking marijuana for breakfast during that period. Nobody could communicate with us, it was all glazed eyes and giggling all the time. In our own world. It's like doing nothing most of the time, but still having to rise at 7&nbsp;am, so we became bored.}}\n\nA contributing factor was exhaustion attributable to their busy schedule of writing, recording and touring. Afterward they were hesitant to begin another film project, and indeed ''Help!'' was their last full-length scripted theatrical film. Their obligation for a third film to United Artists was met by the 1970 documentary film [[Let It Be (film)|''Let It Be'']]. The 1968 animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' did not meet contractual obligations because it did not star the Beatles, and their only live appearance was featured for less than two minutes at the film's conclusion.\n\n===Inspiration===\nThe Beatles said the film was inspired by the classic [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'';<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRpqWHwLZNoC&pg=PT377 |title=Shout!: The Beatles in Their Generation |page=1377 |isbn=0-7432-5378-7 |year=2011 |last=Norman |first=Phillip |publisher=Simon and Schuster |accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref> it was also directly satirical of the [[James Bond]] series of films.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8Ob1bL_ongC&pg=PA102 |page=102 |title=Reading the Beatles: Cultural Studies, Literary Criticism, and the Fab Four |year=2012 |last=Womack |first=Kenneth |author2=Davis, Todd F |isbn=0-7914-8196-4 |publisher=SUNY Press |accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref> At the time of the original release of ''Help!'', its distributor, [[United Artists]], also held the rights to the Bond series.\n\nThe humour of the film is strongly influenced by the abstract humour of ''[[The Goon Show]]'', in which the director had personal and direct experience in the conversion of the radio format to television, and personal working experience with [[Peter Sellers]] in particular.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HESlHkg_pRoC&pg=PA54 |title=John Lennon Imagined: Cultural History of a Rock Star |page=54 |isbn=0-8204-6788-X |year=2004 |last=M\u00e4kel\u00e4 |first=Janne |publisher=Peter Lang |accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref> Beatles recording producer [[George Martin]] had also produced records for the ''Goon Show'' team. McCartney has always said that the Beatles style of humour was taken from the ''Goon Show''. Many of the film's concepts are derived from ''Goon Show''s, such as the presence of wild animals, music, [[fourth wall]]-breaking jokes and abstractions such as the closing statement that concludes the film.\n\n===Working title===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nThe original working title for the film was ''Eight Arms to Hold You''. This title was printed on the single \"Ticket to Ride\" as an upcoming film. Because of this, the phrase has been used as a title for an album by [[Veruca Salt]] and for songs by [[The Goonies]] and by the Brittles, a Beatles-pastiche band.\n\nThe Lennon-McCartney composition \"[[Eight Days a Week]]\" was briefly considered as a potential theme song for the film, but the idea was scrapped and the song was instead recorded and issued as an album track on ''[[Beatles for Sale]]'', as well as a single in the United States.\n\n===\"Haze of marijuana\"===\nThe Beatles later said the film was shot in a \"haze of marijuana\". According to Starr's interviews in ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', during the Austrian Alps film shooting, he and McCartney ran off over the hill from the \"[[curling]]\" scene set to smoke a joint.\n{{quote|text=A hell of a lot of pot was being smoked while we were making the film. It was great. That helped make it a lot of fun&nbsp;... In one of the scenes, Victor Spinetti and Roy Kinnear are playing curling: sliding along those big stones. One of the stones has a bomb in it and we find out that it's going to blow up, and have to run away. Well, Paul and I ran about seven miles, we ran and ran, just so we could stop and have a joint before we came back. We could have run all the way to Switzerland. If you look at pictures of us you can see a lot of red-eyed shots; they were red from the dope we were smoking. And these were those clean-cut boys! Dick Lester knew that very little would get done after lunch. In the afternoon we very seldom got past the first line of the script. We had such hysterics that no one could do anything. Dick Lester would say, \"No, boys, could we do it again?\" It was just that we had a lot of fun \u2013 a lot of fun in those days.|sign=Ringo Starr}}\n\nIn the ''Beatles Anthology Director's Cut'', Harrison admitted that they were smoking marijuana on the plane ride all the way to the Bahamas.\n\nMcCartney also shared some of his memories of when they were filming ''Help!'':\n\n{{quote|text=We showed up a bit stoned, smiled a lot and hoped we'd get through it. We giggled a lot. I remember one time at Cliveden (Lord Astor's place, where the [[Profumo affair|Christine Keeler/Profumo scandal]] went on); we were filming the [[Buckingham Palace]] scene where we were all supposed to have our hands up. It was after lunch, which was fatal because someone might have brought out a glass of wine as well. We were all a bit merry and all had our backs to the camera and the giggles set in. All we had to do was turn around and look amazed, or something. But every time we'd turn round to the camera there were tears streaming down our faces. It's OK to get the giggles anywhere else but in films, because the technicians get pissed off with you. They think, \"They're not very professional.\" Then you start thinking, \"This isn't very professional \u2013 but we're having a great laugh.\"|sign=Paul McCartney}}\n\n{{quote|text=John did once offer me a joint. And I obligingly tried to take a little puff. I knew there was some special way of doing it \u2013 but I don't smoke anyway. So I took a little puff and then thought, \"This is so expensive. I mustn't waste it!\"  And gave it back to him. So that's your definition of na\u00efve, I think.|sign=Eleanor Bron}}\n\nThe photographer [[Michael Peto]] was commissioned in 1965 to take still photographs during the making of the film; these became known for their candid and expressive quality.

The second side consisted of other new Beatles songs recorded at the same time or shortly afterwards. The US album, released by Capitol Records, includes the seven film tracks along with instrumental soundtrack songs orchestrated by Ken Thorne.  In addition, the US soundtrack leads off with a hidden track stylized as a satirical \"James Bond Theme\" before the title track, \"Help!\".  Early pressings of the US version of the album ''[[1962\u20131966]]'' include this hidden track banded as \"Help!\", and later pressings, when the UK catalogue was made the official and only catalogue of Beatles albums, omit it.\n\n==Critical response==\nCritical opinion at the time of release was generally positive, but many critics feel that this big budget effort was not as strong as ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. [[Leslie Halliwell]] describes it as an {{quote|text=[e]xhausting attempt to outdo ''A Hard Day's Night'' in lunatic frenzy, which goes to show that some talents work best on low budgets. The humour is a frantic cross between ''[[Hellzapoppin' (film)|Hellzapoppin']]'', [[The Goon Show|The Goons]], [[Goofy]], [[Mr. Magoo]] and the shade of [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]] to come. It looks good but becomes too tiresome to entertain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Halliwell |first=Leslie |title=Halliwell's Film and Video Guide |year=1997 |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |location=London |isbn=0-00-638779-9 |page=338}}</ref>}}\n\n[[AllMovie]]'s Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr. describes it as {{quote|text=...&nbsp;a forerunner to music videos.&nbsp;... [[Richard Lester|Lester]] seemed to find the right tone for ''Help!'', creating an enjoyable portrait of the Beatles and never allowing the film to take itself too seriously. His style would later be co-opted by [[Bob Rafelson|Bob Rafaelson]]{{sic}} for [[the Monkees]]' television series in the '60s and has continued to influence rock musicals like ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'' in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:22130~T1 |title=Help! |accessdate=24 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426195934/http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg |archivedate=26 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n\nIn a contemporary review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' their critic [[Bosley Crowther]] was not impressed: {{quote|text=...&nbsp;It's a fiasco of farcical whimseys that are thrown together in this film\u2014a clutter of mechanical gimmicks and madcap chases.&nbsp;... Funny? Exciting? Different? Well, there's nothing in \"Help!\" to compare with that wild ballet of the Beatles racing across a playground in \"A Hard Day's Night\", nothing as wistful as the ramble of Ringo around London all alone.&nbsp;... The boys themselves are exuberant and uninhibited in their own genial way.

However, the sequence was left in the film novelisation.\n\n==Release history==\nLike ''A Hard Day's Night'', ''Help!'' was originally distributed theatrically by [[United Artists]] \u2013 the company handled distribution from 1965 to the end of 1980. In January 1981, rights to the film reverted from UA to producer Walter Shenson, and the film was withdrawn from circulation.\n\n''Help!'' was released several times in different video formats by MPI Home Video and [[The Criterion Collection]]. A version was released in February 1987 in VHS and Beta through MPI, along with a reissue of ''A Hard Day's Night'' the very same day, and was followed by a special-edition release on 31 October 1995. MPI also issued a CLV laserdisc in 1995 and two releases on DVD, the first as a single DVD release on 12 November 1997 and the second as part of ''The Beatles DVD Collector's Set'' on 8 August 2000.\n\nLaserDisc releases include a Criterion CAV laserdisc and a Voyager CLV laserdisc in 1987, each of which had three pressings. The first pressings had no [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] on the gatefold covers while the other two had the UPC either as a sticker or printed directly on the jacket.\n\nThe film's transfer on the CAV laserdiscs was done correctly so that no blending of frames occurs and thus movements are not blurry. The supplemental section, which, with few exceptions, has never been available on any other home video release, contains the following:\n* original theatrical trailer (which includes deleted scenes)\n* silent home film footage of the film set and of the world premiere\n* still photos, some of which are introduced by text describing the production history of the film\n* posters\n* sheet music\n* record jackets\n* radio ads (on audio during the silent footage)\n* an open interview, originally designed for disc jockeys. By reading prompts on the screen, one can pretend to talk to the Beatles.\n\nIn June 2007, a version of ''Help!'', sub-titled in Korean, became available on Amazon.com. However, by July 2007, all home video versions of the film were pulled from the market because of rights issues involving Apple Corps \u2013 now the full rights holders to the film. The rights issues were eventually resolved and Apple Corps/EMI/Capitol released a new double DVD version with a fully restored image and newly remixed in 2.0 stereo and [[5.1]] [[surround]] sound of the film. This came in standard 2xDVD packaging and 2xDVD deluxe edition box set on 30 October 2007 in the UK and 6 November 2007 in America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2007/press60.htm |title=Stop worrying&nbsp;...

{"title_page": "Commander-in-chief", "text_new": "{{Redirect|CINC|other uses}}\n{{Other uses|Commander in Chief (pepi}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n{{Military units}}\n{{Chain of Command}}\n\nA '''wcommander-in-chief''', also called '''supreme commander''', is the person that exercises supreme [[command and control]] over an [[armed forces]] or a [[military branch]]. As a technical term, it refers to military competencies that reside in a country's executive leadership \u2013 a [[head of state]] or a [[head of government]].\n\nOften, a commander-in-chief role if held by an [[official]], need not be or have been a [[commissioned officer]] or even a [[veteran]]. Such countries follow the principle of [[civilian control of the military]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe formal role and title of a ruler commanding the armed forces derives from ''[[Imperator]]'' of the [[Roman Kingdom]], [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]], who possessed ''imperium'' (command and other regal) powers.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Auctor.html LacusCurtius \u2022 Roman Law \u2014 Auctor (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)]</ref>\n\nIn English use, the term first applied to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] in 1639.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} It continued to be used during the [[English Civil War]].<ref>For example: \"Ordered, That this House joins and agrees with the House of Commons in this Vote; and that the Lord Admiral is hereby desired, from both Houses of Parliament, that the Commander in Chief of this Summer's Fleet under his Lordship, may be the Earl of Warwicke.\", [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/lords-jrnl/vol4/pp645-646#h3-0007 House of Lords Journal 15 March 1642]</ref> A nation's [[head of state]] (monarchical or republican) usually holds the nominal position of commander-in-chief, even if effective executive power is held by a separate [[head of government]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], the [[executive branch]] is ultimately dependent upon the will of the [[legislature]]; although the legislature does not issue orders directly to the armed forces and therefore does not control the military in any operational sense. [[Governor-general|Governors-general]] and colonial governors are also often appointed commander-in-chief of the military forces within their territory.\n\nA commander-in-chief is sometimes referred to as ''supreme commander'', which is sometimes used as a specific term. The term is also used for military officers who hold such power and authority, not always through dictatorship, and as a subordinate (usually) to a head of state (see [[Generalissimo]]). The term is also used for officers who hold authority over an individual [[military branch]], [[special branch]] or within a [[theatre of operations]].<ref>Dupuy, Trevor N., Curt Johnson, and Grace P.

As a technical term, it refers to military competencies that reside in a country's executive leadership \u2013 a [[head of state]] or a [[head of government]].\n\nOften, a commander-in-chief role if held by an [[official]], need not be or have been a [[commissioned officer]] or even a [[veteran]]. Such countries follow the principle of [[civilian control of the military]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe formal role and title of a ruler commanding the armed forces derives from ''[[Imperator]]'' of the [[Roman Kingdom]], [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]], who possessed ''imperium'' (command and other regal) powers.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Auctor.html LacusCurtius \u2022 Roman Law \u2014 Auctor (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)]</ref>\n\nIn English use, the term first applied to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] in 1639.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} It continued to be used during the [[English Civil War]].<ref>For example: \"Ordered, That this House joins and agrees with the House of Commons in this Vote; and that the Lord Admiral is hereby desired, from both Houses of Parliament, that the Commander in Chief of this Summer's Fleet under his Lordship, may be the Earl of Warwicke.\", [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/lords-jrnl/vol4/pp645-646#h3-0007 House of Lords Journal 15 March 1642]</ref> A nation's [[head of state]] (monarchical or republican) usually holds the nominal position of commander-in-chief, even if effective executive power is held by a separate [[head of government]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], the [[executive branch]] is ultimately dependent upon the will of the [[legislature]]; although the legislature does not issue orders directly to the armed forces and therefore does not control the military in any operational sense. [[Governor-general|Governors-general]] and colonial governors are also often appointed commander-in-chief of the military forces within their territory.\n\nA commander-in-chief is sometimes referred to as ''supreme commander'', which is sometimes used as a specific term. The term is also used for military officers who hold such power and authority, not always through dictatorship, and as a subordinate (usually) to a head of state (see [[Generalissimo]]). The term is also used for officers who hold authority over an individual [[military branch]], [[special branch]] or within a [[theatre of operations]].<ref>Dupuy, Trevor N., Curt Johnson, and Grace P.

The office of the Venezuelan military supreme commander in chief has always been held by the president of Venezuela as per constitutional requirements. However, with a new law sanctioned in 2008, the \"comandante en jefe\" rank is not only a function attributed to the executive branch but a full military rank given to the president upon taking office. Upon assumption he receives a saber, epaulette, shoulder knot, shoulder board and sleeve insignia and full military uniform to be used in military events while performing the duties as president. The shoulder insignia mirrors Cuban practice but is derived from the German-styled officer rank insignia.\n\n===Vietnam===\nThe commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the [[president of Vietnam]], through his post as chairman of National Defense and Security Council. Though this position is nominal and real power is assumed by the [[Central Military Commission (Vietnam)|Central Military Commission]] of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]]. The secretary of Central Military Commission (usually the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam|general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam]]) is the ''de facto'' commander.\n\nThe [[Ministry of Defence (Vietnam)|minister of Defence]] oversees operations of the Ministry of Defence, and the [[Vietnam People's Army]].
