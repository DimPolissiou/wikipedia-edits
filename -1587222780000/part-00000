Only after his death did [[Robert Bridges]] begin to publish a few of Hopkins's mature poems in anthologies, hoping to prepare the way for wider acceptance of his style. By 1930 his work was recognised as being among the most original literary accomplishments of his century. It had a marked influence on such leading 20th-century poets as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Cecil Day-Lewis]].\n\n==Life==\n===Early life and family ===\nGerard Manley Hopkins was born in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], [[South Essex (UK Parliament constituency)|Essex]]<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\">Gardner, W.

His father founded a marine insurance firm and at one time served as Hawaiian [[consul (representative)#Consulates and embassies|consul-general]] in London. He was also for a time [[churchwarden]] at [[St John-at-Hampstead]]. His grandfather was the physician John Simm Smith, a university colleague of [[John Keats]], and close friend of the eccentric philanthropist [[Ann Thwaytes]].\n\nAs a poet, Hopkins's father published works including ''A Philosopher's Stone and Other Poems'' (1843), ''Pietas Metrica'' (1849), and ''Spicelegium Poeticum, A Gathering of Verses by Manley Hopkins'' (1892). He reviewed poetry for ''[[The Times]]'' and wrote one novel. Catherine (Smith) Hopkins was the daughter of a London physician, particularly fond of music and of reading, especially [[German philosophy]], literature and the novels of [[Dickens]]. Both parents were deeply religious [[high-church]] Anglicans. Catherine's sister, Maria Smith Giberne, taught her nephew Gerard to sketch. The interest was supported by his uncle, Edward Smith, his great-uncle [[Richard James Lane]], a professional artist, and many other family members.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> Hopkins's first ambition was to be a painter, and he would continue to sketch throughout his life, inspired as an adult by the work of [[John Ruskin]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelites]].<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/><ref name=\"PF\">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=81375 Poetry Foundation Biography] accessed 18 March 2010</ref>\n\nHopkins became a skilled draughtsman, and found his early training in visual art supported his later work as a poet.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> His siblings were greatly inspired by language, religion and the creative arts. Milicent (1849\u20131946) joined an Anglican sisterhood in 1878. Kate (1856\u20131933) would go on to help Hopkins publish the first edition of his poetry. Hopkins's youngest sister Grace (1857\u20131945) set many of his poems to music. [[Lionel Charles Hopkins|Lionel]] (1854\u20131952) became a world-famous expert on archaic and colloquial Chinese. Arthur (1848\u20131930) and Everard (1860\u20131928) were both highly successful artists. Cyril (1846\u20131932) was to join his father's insurance firm.<ref name=\"PF\" />\n[[File:Young Gerard Manley Hopkins.jpg|thumb|right|Hopkins, painted 24 July 1866]]\n\nManley Hopkins moved his family to Hampstead in 1852, near where [[John Keats]] had lived thirty years before and close to the wide green spaces of [[Hampstead Heath]]. When he was ten years old, Gerard was sent to board at [[Highgate School]] (1854\u20131863).<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> While studying Keats's poetry, he wrote \"The Escorial\" (1860), his earliest extant poem. Here he practised early attempts at asceticism. He once argued that most people drank more liquids than they really needed and bet that he could go without drinking for a week. He persisted until his tongue was black and he collapsed at drill.

On 23 January, he included poetry in the list of things to be given up for [[Lent]]. In July, he decided to become a Roman Catholic and travelled to Birmingham in September to consult the leader of the Oxford converts, [[John Henry Newman]].<ref Name=\"Gardnerxviii\"/> Newman received him into the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on 21 October 1866.\n\nThe decision to convert estranged him from his family and from a number of his acquaintances. After his graduation in 1867, Hopkins was provided by Newman with a teaching post at the Oratory in Birmingham. While there he began to study the violin. On 5 May 1868 Hopkins firmly \"resolved to be a religious.\" Less than a week later, he made a bonfire of his poems and gave up poetry almost entirely for seven years. He also felt the call to enter the ministry and decided to become a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]. He paused to first visit [[Switzerland]], which officially forbade Jesuits to enter.<ref name=\"PF\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">P. Kitchen, ''Gerard Manley Hopkins'', London, 1978.</ref>\n\nHopkins began his Jesuit novitiate at [[Parkstead House|Manresa House]], [[Roehampton]], in September 1868. Two years later, he moved to St Mary's Hall, [[Stonyhurst]], for his philosophical studies, taking vows of poverty, chastity and obedience on 8 September 1870.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gerardmanleyhopkins.net/about/gerard_manley_hopkins.html |title=Gerard Manley Hopkins, Poet Priest Artist Writer Musician |work=Gerard Manley Hopkins' poems to music |first=Sean |last=O'Leary |accessdate=15 May 2017 |date=July 2006}}</ref> He felt his interest in poetry had stopped him devoting himself wholly to religion. However, on reading [[Duns Scotus]] in 1872, he saw that the two need not conflict.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hopkins/hopkins12.html Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Brief Biography] Glenn Everett, PhD.</ref> He continued to write a detailed prose journal between 1868 and 1875. Unable to suppress his desire to describe the natural world, he also wrote music, sketched, and for church occasions wrote some \"verses,\" as he called them. He would later write sermons and other religious pieces.\n\nIn 1874 Hopkins returned to Manresa House to teach classics. While he was studying in the Jesuit house of theological studies, [[St Beuno's Ignatian Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's]], near [[St Asaph]] in [[North Wales]], he was asked by his religious superior to write a poem to commemorate the foundering of a German ship in a storm. So in 1875, he was moved to take up poetry once more and write a lengthy poem, \"[[The Wreck of the Deutschland]]\". The work was inspired by the ''[[Deutschland (1866)|Deutschland]]'' incident, a maritime disaster in which 157 people died, including five [[Franciscan]] nuns who had been leaving Germany due to harsh [[anti-Catholic]] laws (see [[Kulturkampf]]). The work displays both the religious concerns and some of the unusual [[meter (poetry)|metre]] and rhythms of his subsequent poetry not present in his few remaining early works. It not only depicts the dramatic events and heroic deeds but also tells of the poet's reconciling the terrible events with God's higher purpose. The poem was accepted but not printed by a Jesuit publication. This rejection fed his ambivalence about his poetry. Most of his poetry remained unpublished until after his death.\n\n[[File:GerardManleyHopkinsBluePlaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque commemorating Hopkins in Roehampton, London]]\nHopkins chose the austere and restrictive life of a Jesuit and was at times gloomy. Biographer [[Robert Bernard Martin]] notes that \"the life expectancy of a man becoming a novice at twenty-one was twenty-three more years rather than the forty years of males of the same age in the general population.\"<ref name=Ricks/> The brilliant student who had left Oxford with a first-class honours degree failed his final theology exam. This failure almost certainly meant that, although ordained in 1877, Hopkins would not progress in the order. In 1877 he wrote ''God's Grandeur'', an array of sonnets which included \"The Starlight Night\". He finished \"[[The Windhover]]\" only a few months before his ordination. Though rigorous, isolated and sometimes unpleasant, his life during Jesuit training had at least some stability; the uncertain and varied work after ordination was even harder on his sensibilities. In October 1877, not long after he completed \"The Sea and the Skylark\" and only a month after he had been ordained as a priest, Hopkins took up his duties as sub-minister and teacher at [[Mount St Mary's College]] near Sheffield. In July 1878 he became curate at the Jesuit church in Mount Street, London, and in December that of [[Oxford Oratory|St Aloysius's Church, Oxford]], then moving to Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow.<ref name=\"PF\" /> While ministering in Oxford, he became a founding member of [[The Newman Society]], a society established in 1878 for Catholic members of the [[University of Oxford]]. He taught Greek and Latin at [[Mount St Mary's College]], Sheffield, and [[Stonyhurst College]], Lancashire.\n\nIn 1884 he became professor of Greek and Latin at [[University College Dublin]].<ref>New English key notes 2013 Mentor books Dublin</ref> His English roots and his disagreement with the Irish politics of the time, as well as his own small stature (5 feet 2 inches), unprepossessing nature and personal oddities meant that he was not a particularly effective teacher. This, as well as his isolation in Ireland, deepened his gloom. His poems of the time, such as \"I Wake and Feel the Fell of Dark, not Day\", reflected this. They came to be known as the \"terrible sonnets\", not because of their quality but because according to Hopkins's friend Canon Richard Watson Dixon, they reached the \"terrible crystal\", meaning that they crystallised the melancholic dejection that plagued the later part of Hopkins's life.\n\n===Final years===\nSeveral issues brought about this melancholic state and restricted his poetic inspiration during the last five years of his life.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxxvii\">Gardner, W.&nbsp;H. (1963) ''Gerard Manly Hopkins: Poems and Prose'' Penguin pxxvii</ref> His workload was extremely heavy. He disliked living in Dublin, away from England and friends; he was also disappointed at how far the city had fallen from its Georgian elegance of the previous century.<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/gerard-manley-hopkins-ucd-misery-was-literature-s-gain-1.3091916</ref> His general health deteriorated as his eyesight began to fail. He felt confined and dejected. As a devout Jesuit, he found himself in an artistic dilemma. To subdue any egotism which would violate the humility required by his religious position, he decided never to publish his poems. But Hopkins realized that any true poet requires an audience for criticism and encouragement. This conflict between his religious obligations and his poetic talent caused him to feel that he had failed them both.\n\nAfter suffering ill health for several years and bouts of [[diarrhea]], Hopkins died of [[typhoid fever]] in 1889 and was buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]],<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Kindle Edition.</ref> following his funeral in [[Saint Francis Xavier Church, Dublin|Saint Francis Xavier Church]] on [[Gardiner Street]], located in Georgian [[Dublin]]. He is thought to have suffered throughout his life from what today might be diagnosed as either [[bipolar disorder]] or chronic [[unipolar depression]],{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} and battled a deep sense of melancholic anguish. However, on his death bed, his last words were, \"I am so happy, I am so happy. I loved my life.\" He was 45 years of age.<ref name=\"ER\"/>\n\n==Poetry==\n===\"The sonnets of desolation\"===\nAccording to [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]], \"All his life Hopkins was haunted by the sense of personal bankruptcy and impotence, the straining of 'time's eunuch' with no more to 'spend'... \" a sense of inadequacy, graphically expressed in his last sonnets.<ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v13/n08/john-bayley/pork-chops Bayley, John. \"Review: Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life by Robert Bernard Martin\", ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 13 No. 8, 25 April 1991]</ref> Toward the end of his life, Hopkins suffered several long bouts of depression. His \"terrible sonnets\" struggle with problems of religious doubt. He described them to Bridges as \"[t]he thin gleanings of a long weary while.\"<ref name=Allbery>[http://poems.com/Poets'%20Picks%202012/April_24_Debra_Allbery.html Allbery, Debra. \"To seem the stranger lies my lot, my life\", Poetry Daily, April 24, 2012]</ref>\n\n\"Thou Art Indeed Just, Lord\" (1889) echoes ''Jeremiah'' 12:1 in asking why the wicked prosper.

Prior to Hopkins, most [[Middle English]] and [[Modern English]] poetry was based on a rhythmic structure inherited from the Norman side of English literary heritage. This structure is based on repeating \"feet\" of two or three syllables, with the stressed syllable falling in the same place on each repetition. Hopkins called this structure \"running rhythm\", and although he wrote some of his early verse in running rhythm, he became fascinated with the older rhythmic structure of the Anglo-Saxon tradition, of which ''[[Beowulf]]'' is the most famous example.\n\nHopkins called his own rhythmic structure [[sprung rhythm]]. Sprung rhythm is structured around feet with a variable number of syllables, generally between one and four syllables per foot, with the stress always falling on the first syllable in a foot. It is similar to the \"rolling stresses\" of [[Robinson Jeffers]], another poet who rejected conventional metre. Hopkins saw sprung rhythm as a way to escape the constraints of running rhythm, which he said inevitably pushed poetry written in it to become \"same and tame\". In this way, Hopkins sprung rhythm can be seen as anticipating much of [[free verse]]. His work has no great affinity with either of the contemporary [[Pre-Raphaelite]] and [[neo-romanticism]] schools, although he does share their descriptive love of nature and he is often seen as a precursor to [[modernist poetry]], or as a bridge between the two poetic eras.\n\n===Use of language===\nThe language of Hopkins's poems is often striking. His imagery can be simple, as in ''Heaven-Haven'', where the comparison is between a nun entering a convent and a ship entering a harbour out of a storm. It can be splendidly metaphysical and intricate, as it is in ''As Kingfishers Catch Fire'', where he leaps from one image to another to show how each thing expresses its own uniqueness, and how divinity reflects itself through all of them.\n\nHopkins was a supporter of [[linguistic purism in English]]. In an 1882 letter to [[Robert Bridges]], Hopkins writes: \"It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity.\"<ref>Nils Langer, Winifred V. Davies. ''Linguistic purism in the Germanic languages''. Walter de Gruyter, 2005. p. 328.</ref> He took time to learn [[Old English]], which became a major influence on his writing. In the same letter to Bridges he calls Old English \"a vastly superior thing to what we have now.\"<ref name=\"BROOK-1\">[[George Leslie Brook|Brook, George Leslie]] (1955). ''An Introduction to Old English'', Manchester University Press, p. 1.</ref>\n\nHe uses many archaic and dialect words but also coins new words. One example of this is ''twindles'', which seems from its context in ''Inversnaid'' to mean a combination of ''twines'' and ''dwindles''. He often creates compound adjectives, sometimes with a hyphen (such as ''dapple-dawn-drawn falcon'') but often without, as in ''rolling level underneath him steady air''. This use of compound adjectives, similar to the Old English use of [[Kenning|compounds nouns]], concentrates his images, communicating to his readers the [[instress]] of the poet's perceptions of an [[inscape]].\n\nAdded richness comes from Hopkins's extensive use of [[alliteration]], [[assonance]], [[onomatopoeia]] and [[rhyme]], both at the end of lines and internally as in:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAs kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;\nAs tumbled over rim in roundy wells\nStones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's\nBow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;\n</poem>}}\n\nHopkins was influenced by the [[Welsh language]], which he had acquired while studying theology at [[St Beuno's Ignatian Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's]] near [[St Asaph]]. The poetic forms of [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|Welsh literature]] and particularly [[cynghanedd]], with its emphasis on repeating sounds, accorded with his own style and became a prominent feature of his work. This reliance on similar-sounding words with close or differing senses means that his poems are best understood if read aloud. An important element in his work is Hopkins's own concept of inscape, which was derived in part from the medieval theologian [[Duns Scotus]]. Anthony Domestico explains,<blockquote>Inscape, for Hopkins, is the charged essence, the absolute singularity that gives each created thing its being; instress is both the energy that holds the inscape together and the process by which this inscape is perceived by an observer. We instress the inscape of a tulip, Hopkins would say, when we appreciate the particular delicacy of its petals, when we are enraptured by its specific, inimitable shade of pink.\"<ref name=Domestico/></blockquote>\n\n''[[The Windhover]]'' aims to depict not the bird in general, but instead one instance and its relation to the breeze. This is just one interpretation of Hopkins's most famous poem, one which he felt was his best.<ref name=\"ER\"/>\n{{Quote box |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote=<poem>\n\nI caught this morning morning's minion, king-\n dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\n As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\n Rebuffed the big wind.

It was only through the efforts of Robert Bridges that his works were seen. Despite Hopkins burning all his poems on entering the Jesuit novitiate, he had already sent some to Bridges, who with some other friends, was one of the few people to see many of them for some years. After Hopkins's death they were distributed to a wider audience, mostly fellow poets, and in 1918 Bridges, by then [[poet laureate]], published a collected edition; an expanded edition, prepared by [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], appeared in 1930, and a greatly expanded edition by [[William Henry Gardner]] appeared in 1948 (eventually reaching a fourth edition, 1967, with N. H. Mackenzie).\n\nNotable collections of Hopkins's manuscripts and publications are in [[Campion Hall, Oxford]]; the [[Bodleian Library]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]; and the Foley Library at [[Gonzaga University]] in [[Spokane, Washington]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://researchguides.gonzaga.edu/c.php?g=67720&p=436824 |title=LibGuides: Manuscript Collections: Hopkins |last=Plowman |first=Stephanie |website=researchguides.gonzaga.edu  |access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\n====Erotic====\nTimothy d'Arch Smith, antiquarian bookseller, ascribes to Hopkins suppressed erotic impulses which he views as taking on a degree of specificity after Hopkins met [[Robert Bridges]]'s distant cousin, friend, and fellow Etonian [[Digby Mackworth Dolben]], \"a Christian [[Uranian]]\".<ref>Timothy d'Arch Smith. ''Love in Earnest'', p. 188.</ref> Robert Martin asserts that when Hopkins first met Dolben, on Dolben's 17th birthday in Oxford in February 1865, it \"was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, probably of his entire life.\"<ref>''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'', p. 80; see also Norman White, ''Hopkins: A Literary Biography'', p. 110.</ref> According to Robert Martin, \"Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confessions the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him.\"<ref>Robert Bernard Martin, \"Digby Augustus Stewart Dolben,\" ''DNB'')</ref> Martin also considers it \"probable that [Hopkins] would have been deeply shocked at the reality of sexual intimacy with another person.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hdXg7cVBH8EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Robert+Bernard+Martin&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF_-ez_NjOAhUHGR4KHV07D0cQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Bernard%20Martin&f=false Martin, Robert Bernard. ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'', Chapter III, Faber and Faber]</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerard Manley Hopkins.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gerard Manley Hopkins]]\nHopkins composed two poems about Dolben, \"Where art thou friend\" and \"The Beginning of the End\". Robert Bridges, who edited the first edition of Dolben's poems as well as Hopkins's, cautioned that the second poem \"must never be printed,\" though Bridges himself included it in the first edition (1918).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/eng_lit2_19c,5.html |title=Joseph Cady ''English Literature: Nineteenth Century'' |access-date=1 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301045049/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/eng_lit2_19c,5.html |archive-date=1 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another indication of the nature of his feelings for Dolben is that Hopkins's high Anglican confessor seems to have forbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. Hopkins never saw Dolben again after the latter's short visit to Oxford during which they met, and any continuation of their relationship was abruptly ended by Dolben's drowning two years later in June 1867. Hopkins's feeling for Dolben seems to have cooled by that time, but he was nonetheless greatly affected by his death. \"Ironically, fate may have bestowed more through Dolben's death than it could ever have bestowed through longer life ... [for] many of Hopkins's best poems \u2013 impregnated with an elegiac longing for Dolben, his lost beloved and his muse \u2013 were the result.\"<ref>Michael M.

Hopkins's journal writings, they argue, offer a clear admiration for feminised beauty. In his book ''Hopkins Reconstructed'' (2000), Justus George Lawler criticises Robert Martin's controversial biography ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'' (1991) by suggesting that Martin \"cannot see the heterosexual beam... for the homosexual biographical mote in his own eye... it amounts to a slanted [[eisegesis]]\". The poems that elicit homoerotic readings can be read not merely as exercises in sublimation but as powerful renditions of religious conviction, a conviction that caused strain in his family and even led him to burn some poems that he felt were unnecessarily self-centred. Julia Saville's book ''A Queer Chivalry'' views the religious imagery in the poems as Hopkins's way of expressing the tension with homosexual identity and desire.\n\n[[Christopher Ricks]] notes that Hopkins engaged in a number of penitential practices, \"but all of these self-inflictions were not self-inflictions to him, and they are his business \u2013 or are his understanding of what it was for him to be about his Father's business.\"<ref name=Ricks/> Ricks takes issue with Martin's apparent lack of appreciation of the importance of the role of Hopkins's religious commitment to his writing, and cautions against assigning a priority of influence to any sexual instincts over other factors such as Hopkins's estrangement from his family.<ref name=Ricks/> Biographer Paul Mariani finds in Hopkins poems \"an irreconcilable tension \u2013 on the one hand, the selflessness demanded by Jesuit discipline; on the other, the seeming self-indulgence of poetic creation.\"<ref name=Domestico>[https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/inscape-instress-distress?_ga=1.190997742.596395981.1472016212 Domestico, Anthony. \"Inscape, Instress & Distress\", ''Commonweal'', March 9, 2009]</ref>\n\n====Isolation====\nHopkins spent the last five years of his life as a classics professor at University College Dublin. Hopkins's isolation in 1885 was multiple: a Jesuit distanced from his Anglican family and his homeland, an Englishman teaching in Dublin during a time of political strife, an unpublished poet striving to reconcile his artistic and religious callings.<ref name=Allbery/> The poem \"To seem the stranger\" was written in Ireland between 1885 and 1886 and is a poem of isolation and loneliness.<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-seem-the-stranger-lies-my-lot-my-life/ Hopkins, Gerard M. \"To seem the stranger lies my lot, my life\", Poemhunter.com]</ref>\n\n==Influence on others==\nRicks called Hopkins \"the most original poet of the Victorian age.\"<ref name=Ricks>[https://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-art-and-faith-of-Gerard-Manley-Hopkins-4424 Ricks, Christopher. \"The art and faith of Gerard Manley Hopkins\", ''The New Criterion'', September 1991]</ref> Hopkins is considered as influential as [[T.

His manipulation of [[Metre (poetry)|prosody]] \u2013 particularly his concept of [[sprung rhythm]] and use of [[Imagery (literature)|imagery]] \u2013 established him as an innovative writer of verse. Two of his major themes were nature and religion. Only after his death did [[Robert Bridges]] begin to publish a few of Hopkins's mature poems in anthologies, hoping to prepare the way for wider acceptance of his style. By 1930 his work was recognised as being among the most original literary accomplishments of his century. It had a marked influence on such leading 20th-century poets as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Cecil Day-Lewis]].\n\n==Life==\n===Early life and family ===\nGerard Manley Hopkins was born in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], [[South Essex (UK Parliament constituency)|Essex]]<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\">Gardner, W.

His father founded a marine insurance firm and at one time served as Hawaiian [[consul (representative)#Consulates and embassies|consul-general]] in London. He was also for a time [[churchwarden]] at [[St John-at-Hampstead]]. His grandfather was the physician John Simm Smith, a university colleague of [[John Keats]], and close friend of the eccentric philanthropist [[Ann Thwaytes]].\n\nAs a poet, Hopkins's father published works including ''A Philosopher's Stone and Other Poems'' (1843), ''Pietas Metrica'' (1849), and ''Spicelegium Poeticum, A Gathering of Verses by Manley Hopkins'' (1892). He reviewed poetry for ''[[The Times]]'' and wrote one novel. Catherine (Smith) Hopkins was the daughter of a London physician, particularly fond of music and of reading, especially [[German philosophy]], literature and the novels of [[Dickens]]. Both parents were deeply religious [[high-church]] Anglicans. Catherine's sister, Maria Smith Giberne, taught her nephew Gerard to sketch. The interest was supported by his uncle, Edward Smith, his great-uncle [[Richard James Lane]], a professional artist, and many other family members.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> Hopkins's first ambition was to be a painter, and he would continue to sketch throughout his life, inspired as an adult by the work of [[John Ruskin]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelites]].<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/><ref name=\"PF\">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=81375 Poetry Foundation Biography] accessed 18 March 2010</ref>\n\nHopkins became a skilled draughtsman, and found his early training in visual art supported his later work as a poet.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> His siblings were greatly inspired by language, religion and the creative arts. Milicent (1849\u20131946) joined an Anglican sisterhood in 1878. Kate (1856\u20131933) would go on to help Hopkins publish the first edition of his poetry. Hopkins's youngest sister Grace (1857\u20131945) set many of his poems to music. [[Lionel Charles Hopkins|Lionel]] (1854\u20131952) became a world-famous expert on archaic and colloquial Chinese. Arthur (1848\u20131930) and Everard (1860\u20131928) were both highly successful artists. Cyril (1846\u20131932) was to join his father's insurance firm.<ref name=\"PF\" />\n[[File:Young Gerard Manley Hopkins.jpg|thumb|right|Hopkins, painted 24 July 1866]]\n\nManley Hopkins moved his family to Hampstead in 1852, near where [[John Keats]] had lived thirty years before and close to the wide green spaces of [[Hampstead Heath]]. When he was ten years old, Gerard was sent to board at [[Highgate School]] (1854\u20131863).<ref Name=\"Gardnerxvi\"/> While studying Keats's poetry, he wrote \"The Escorial\" (1860), his earliest extant poem. Here he practised early attempts at asceticism. He once argued that most people drank more liquids than they really needed and bet that he could go without drinking for a week. He persisted until his tongue was black and he collapsed at drill.

On 23 January, he included poetry in the list of things to be given up for [[Lent]]. In July, he decided to become a Roman Catholic and travelled to Birmingham in September to consult the leader of the Oxford converts, [[John Henry Newman]].<ref Name=\"Gardnerxviii\"/> Newman received him into the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on 21 October 1866.\n\nThe decision to convert estranged him from his family and from a number of his acquaintances. After his graduation in 1867, Hopkins was provided by Newman with a teaching post at the Oratory in Birmingham. While there he began to study the violin. On 5 May 1868 Hopkins firmly \"resolved to be a religious.\" Less than a week later, he made a bonfire of his poems and gave up poetry almost entirely for seven years. He also felt the call to enter the ministry and decided to become a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]. He paused to first visit [[Switzerland]], which officially forbade Jesuits to enter.<ref name=\"PF\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">P. Kitchen, ''Gerard Manley Hopkins'', London, 1978.</ref>\n\nHopkins began his Jesuit novitiate at [[Parkstead House|Manresa House]], [[Roehampton]], in September 1868. Two years later, he moved to St Mary's Hall, [[Stonyhurst]], for his philosophical studies, taking vows of poverty, chastity and obedience on 8 September 1870.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gerardmanleyhopkins.net/about/gerard_manley_hopkins.html |title=Gerard Manley Hopkins, Poet Priest Artist Writer Musician |work=Gerard Manley Hopkins' poems to music |first=Sean |last=O'Leary |accessdate=15 May 2017 |date=July 2006}}</ref> He felt his interest in poetry had stopped him devoting himself wholly to religion. However, on reading [[Duns Scotus]] in 1872, he saw that the two need not conflict.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hopkins/hopkins12.html Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Brief Biography] Glenn Everett, PhD.</ref> He continued to write a detailed prose journal between 1868 and 1875. Unable to suppress his desire to describe the natural world, he also wrote music, sketched, and for church occasions wrote some \"verses,\" as he called them. He would later write sermons and other religious pieces.\n\nIn 1874 Hopkins returned to Manresa House to teach classics. While he was studying in the Jesuit house of theological studies, [[St Beuno's Ignatian Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's]], near [[St Asaph]] in [[North Wales]], he was asked by his religious superior to write a poem to commemorate the foundering of a German ship in a storm. So in 1875, he was moved to take up poetry once more and write a lengthy poem, \"[[The Wreck of the Deutschland]]\". The work was inspired by the ''[[Deutschland (1866)|Deutschland]]'' incident, a maritime disaster in which 157 people died, including five [[Franciscan]] nuns who had been leaving Germany due to harsh [[anti-Catholic]] laws (see [[Kulturkampf]]). The work displays both the religious concerns and some of the unusual [[meter (poetry)|metre]] and rhythms of his subsequent poetry not present in his few remaining early works. It not only depicts the dramatic events and heroic deeds but also tells of the poet's reconciling the terrible events with God's higher purpose. The poem was accepted but not printed by a Jesuit publication. This rejection fed his ambivalence about his poetry. Most of his poetry remained unpublished until after his death.\n\n[[File:GerardManleyHopkinsBluePlaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque commemorating Hopkins in Roehampton, London]]\nHopkins chose the austere and restrictive life of a Jesuit and was at times gloomy. Biographer [[Robert Bernard Martin]] notes that \"the life expectancy of a man becoming a novice at twenty-one was twenty-three more years rather than the forty years of males of the same age in the general population.\"<ref name=Ricks/> The brilliant student who had left Oxford with a first-class honours degree failed his final theology exam. This failure almost certainly meant that, although ordained in 1877, Hopkins would not progress in the order. In 1877 he wrote ''God's Grandeur'', an array of sonnets which included \"The Starlight Night\". He finished \"[[The Windhover]]\" only a few months before his ordination. Though rigorous, isolated and sometimes unpleasant, his life during Jesuit training had at least some stability; the uncertain and varied work after ordination was even harder on his sensibilities. In October 1877, not long after he completed \"The Sea and the Skylark\" and only a month after he had been ordained as a priest, Hopkins took up his duties as sub-minister and teacher at [[Mount St Mary's College]] near Sheffield. In July 1878 he became curate at the Jesuit church in Mount Street, London, and in December that of [[Oxford Oratory|St Aloysius's Church, Oxford]], then moving to Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow.<ref name=\"PF\" /> While ministering in Oxford, he became a founding member of [[The Newman Society]], a society established in 1878 for Catholic members of the [[University of Oxford]]. He taught Greek and Latin at [[Mount St Mary's College]], Sheffield, and [[Stonyhurst College]], Lancashire.\n\nIn 1884 he became professor of Greek and Latin at [[University College Dublin]].<ref>New English key notes 2013 Mentor books Dublin</ref> His English roots and his disagreement with the Irish politics of the time, as well as his own small stature (5 feet 2 inches), unprepossessing nature and personal oddities meant that he was not a particularly effective teacher. This, as well as his isolation in Ireland, deepened his gloom. His poems of the time, such as \"I Wake and Feel the Fell of Dark, not Day\", reflected this. They came to be known as the \"terrible sonnets\", not because of their quality but because according to Hopkins's friend Canon Richard Watson Dixon, they reached the \"terrible crystal\", meaning that they crystallised the melancholic dejection that plagued the later part of Hopkins's life.\n\n===Final years===\nSeveral issues brought about this melancholic state and restricted his poetic inspiration during the last five years of his life.<ref Name=\"Gardnerxxvii\">Gardner, W.&nbsp;H. (1963) ''Gerard Manly Hopkins: Poems and Prose'' Penguin pxxvii</ref> His work load was extremely heavy. He disliked living in Dublin, away from England and friends; he was also disappointed at how far the city had fallen from its Georgian elegance of the previous century.<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/gerard-manley-hopkins-ucd-misery-was-literature-s-gain-1.3091916</ref> His general health deteriorated as his eyesight began to fail. He felt confined and dejected. As a devout Jesuit, he found himself in an artistic dilemma. To subdue any egotism which would violate the humility required by his religious position, he decided never to publish his poems. But Hopkins realized that any true poet requires an audience for criticism and encouragement. This conflict between his religious obligations and his poetic talent caused him to feel that he had failed them both.\n\nAfter suffering ill health for several years and bouts of [[diarrhea]], Hopkins died of [[typhoid fever]] in 1889 and was buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]],<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3rd ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 22019). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.</ref> following his funeral in [[Saint Francis Xavier Church, Dublin|Saint Francis Xavier Church]] on [[Gardiner Street]], located in Georgian [[Dublin]]. He is thought to have suffered throughout his life from what today might be diagnosed as either [[bipolar disorder]] or chronic [[unipolar depression]],{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} and battled a deep sense of melancholic anguish. However, on his death bed, his last words were, \"I am so happy, I am so happy. I loved my life.\" He was 45 years of age.<ref name=\"ER\"/>\n\n==Poetry==\n===\"The sonnets of desolation\"===\nAccording to [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]], \"All his life Hopkins was haunted by the sense of personal bankruptcy and impotence, the straining of 'time's eunuch' with no more to 'spend'... \" a sense of inadequacy, graphically expressed in his last sonnets.<ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v13/n08/john-bayley/pork-chops Bayley, John. \"Review: Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life by Robert Bernard Martin\", ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 13 No. 8, 25 April 1991]</ref> Toward the end of his life, Hopkins suffered several long bouts of depression.

Prior to Hopkins, most [[Middle English]] and [[Modern English]] poetry was based on a rhythmic structure inherited from the Norman side of English literary heritage. This structure is based on repeating \"feet\" of two or three syllables, with the stressed syllable falling in the same place on each repetition. Hopkins called this structure \"running rhythm\", and although he wrote some of his early verse in running rhythm, he became fascinated with the older rhythmic structure of the Anglo-Saxon tradition, of which ''[[Beowulf]]'' is the most famous example.\n\nHopkins called his own rhythmic structure [[sprung rhythm]]. Sprung rhythm is structured around feet with a variable number of syllables, generally between one and four syllables per foot, with the stress always falling on the first syllable in a foot. It is similar to the \"rolling stresses\" of [[Robinson Jeffers]], another poet who rejected conventional metre. Hopkins saw sprung rhythm as a way to escape the constraints of running rhythm, which he said inevitably pushed poetry written in it to become \"same and tame\". In this way, Hopkins sprung rhythm can be seen as anticipating much of [[free verse]]. His work has no great affinity with either of the contemporary [[Pre-Raphaelite]] and [[neo-romanticism]] schools, although he does share their descriptive love of nature and he is often seen as a precursor to [[modernist poetry]], or as a bridge between the two poetic eras.\n\n===Use of language===\nThe language of Hopkins's poems is often striking. His imagery can be simple, as in ''Heaven-Haven'', where the comparison is between a nun entering a convent and a ship entering a harbour out of a storm. It can be splendidly metaphysical and intricate, as it is in ''As Kingfishers Catch Fire'', where he leaps from one image to another to show how each thing expresses its own uniqueness, and how divinity reflects itself through all of them.\n\nHopkins was a supporter of [[linguistic purism in English]]. In an 1882 letter to [[Robert Bridges]], Hopkins writes: \"It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity.\"<ref>Nils Langer, Winifred V. Davies. ''Linguistic purism in the Germanic languages''. Walter de Gruyter, 2005. p. 328.</ref> He took time to learn [[Old English]], which became a major influence on his writing. In the same letter to Bridges he calls Old English \"a vastly superior thing to what we have now.\"<ref name=\"BROOK-1\">[[George Leslie Brook|Brook, George Leslie]] (1955). ''An Introduction to Old English'', Manchester University Press, p. 1.</ref>\n\nHe uses many archaic and dialect words but also coins new words. One example of this is ''twindles'', which seems from its context in ''Inversnaid'' to mean a combination of ''twines'' and ''dwindles''. He often creates compound adjectives, sometimes with a hyphen (such as ''dapple-dawn-drawn falcon'') but often without, as in ''rolling level underneath him steady air''. This use of compound adjectives, similar to the Old English use of [[Kenning|compounds nouns]], concentrates his images, communicating to his readers the [[instress]] of the poet's perceptions of an [[inscape]].\n\nAdded richness comes from Hopkins's extensive use of [[alliteration]], [[assonance]], [[onomatopoeia]] and [[rhyme]], both at the end of lines and internally as in:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAs kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;\nAs tumbled over rim in roundy wells\nStones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's\nBow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;\n</poem>}}\n\nHopkins was influenced by the [[Welsh language]], which he had acquired while studying theology at [[St Beuno's Ignatian Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's]] near [[St Asaph]]. The poetic forms of [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|Welsh literature]] and particularly [[cynghanedd]], with its emphasis on repeating sounds, accorded with his own style and became a prominent feature of his work. This reliance on similar-sounding words with close or differing senses means that his poems are best understood if read aloud. An important element in his work is Hopkins's own concept of inscape, which was derived in part from the medieval theologian [[Duns Scotus]]. Anthony Domestico explains,<blockquote>Inscape, for Hopkins, is the charged essence, the absolute singularity that gives each created thing its being; instress is both the energy that holds the inscape together and the process by which this inscape is perceived by an observer. We instress the inscape of a tulip, Hopkins would say, when we appreciate the particular delicacy of its petals, when we are enraptured by its specific, inimitable shade of pink.\"<ref name=Domestico/></blockquote>\n\n''[[The Windhover]]'' aims to depict not the bird in general, but instead one instance and its relation to the breeze. This is just one interpretation of Hopkins's most famous poem, one which he felt was his best.<ref name=\"ER\"/>\n{{Quote box |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote=<poem>\n\nI caught this morning morning's minion, king-\n dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding\n Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding\nHigh there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing\nIn his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,\n As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding\n Rebuffed the big wind.

It was only through the efforts of Robert Bridges that his works were seen. Despite Hopkins burning all his poems on entering the Jesuit novitiate, he had already sent some to Bridges, who with some other friends, was one of the few people to see many of them for some years. After Hopkins's death they were distributed to a wider audience, mostly fellow poets, and in 1918 Bridges, by then [[poet laureate]], published a collected edition; an expanded edition, prepared by [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], appeared in 1930, and a greatly expanded edition by [[William Henry Gardner]] appeared in 1948 (eventually reaching a fourth edition, 1967, with N. H. Mackenzie).\n\nNotable collections of Hopkins's manuscripts and publications are in [[Campion Hall, Oxford]]; the [[Bodleian Library]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]; and the Foley Library at [[Gonzaga University]] in [[Spokane, Washington]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://researchguides.gonzaga.edu/c.php?g=67720&p=436824 |title=LibGuides: Manuscript Collections: Hopkins |last=Plowman |first=Stephanie |website=researchguides.gonzaga.edu  |access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\n====Erotic====\nTimothy d'Arch Smith, antiquarian bookseller, ascribes to Hopkins suppressed erotic impulses which he views as taking on a degree of specificity after Hopkins met [[Robert Bridges]]'s distant cousin, friend, and fellow Etonian [[Digby Mackworth Dolben]], \"a Christian [[Uranian]]\".<ref>Timothy d'Arch Smith. ''Love in Earnest'', p. 188.</ref> Robert Martin asserts that when Hopkins first met Dolben, on Dolben's 17th birthday in Oxford in February 1865, it \"was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, probably of his entire life.\"<ref>''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'', p. 80; see also Norman White, ''Hopkins: A Literary Biography'', p. 110.</ref> According to Robert Martin, \"Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confessions the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him.\"<ref>Robert Bernard Martin, \"Digby Augustus Stewart Dolben,\" ''DNB'')</ref> Martin also considers it \"probable that [Hopkins] would have been deeply shocked at the reality of sexual intimacy with another person.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hdXg7cVBH8EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Robert+Bernard+Martin&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF_-ez_NjOAhUHGR4KHV07D0cQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Bernard%20Martin&f=false Martin, Robert Bernard. ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'', Chapter III, Faber and Faber]</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerard Manley Hopkins.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gerard Manley Hopkins]]\nHopkins composed two poems about Dolben, \"Where art thou friend\" and \"The Beginning of the End\". Robert Bridges, who edited the first edition of Dolben's poems as well as Hopkins's, cautioned that the second poem \"must never be printed,\" though Bridges himself included it in the first edition (1918).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/eng_lit2_19c,5.html |title=Joseph Cady ''English Literature: Nineteenth Century'' |access-date=1 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301045049/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/eng_lit2_19c,5.html |archive-date=1 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another indication of the nature of his feelings for Dolben is that Hopkins's high Anglican confessor seems to have forbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. Hopkins never saw Dolben again after the latter's short visit to Oxford during which they met, and any continuation of their relationship was abruptly ended by Dolben's drowning two years later in June 1867. Hopkins's feeling for Dolben seems to have cooled by that time, but he was nonetheless greatly affected by his death. \"Ironically, fate may have bestowed more through Dolben's death than it could ever have bestowed through longer life ... [for] many of Hopkins's best poems \u2013 impregnated with an elegiac longing for Dolben, his lost beloved and his muse \u2013 were the result.\"<ref>Michael M. Kaylor, ''Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde''. Brno, CZ: Masaryk University Press, 2006. p. 401.</ref> Hopkins's relationship with Dolben is explored in the novel ''The Hopkins Conundrum''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://eye-books.com/books/the-hopkins-conundrum |title=The Hopkins Conundrum |first=Simon |last=Edge |author-link=Simon Edge |publisher=Lightning Books |date=18 May 2017 |isbn=978-1785630330}}</ref>\n\nSome of Hopkins's poems, such as ''The Bugler's First Communion'' and ''Epithalamion'', arguably embody homoerotic themes, although the second poem was arranged by Robert Bridges from extant fragments.<ref>Notes No. 72. Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins; now first published, edited with notes by Robert Bridges. London: Humphrey Milford, 1918.</ref> One contemporary critic, M. M. Kaylor, argued for Hopkins's inclusion with the [[Uranian poetry|Uranian poets]], a group whose writings derived, in many ways, from prose works of [[Walter Pater]], Hopkins's academic coach for his Greats exams and later a lifelong friend.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_-Wa7SIsAQgAC/page/n219 <!-- pg=182 quote=Kaylor's Secret Desires. --> ''The Bugler's First Communion,'' Kaylor, ''Secreted Desires''. pp 182\u201393]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_-Wa7SIsAQgAC/page/n219 <!-- pg=182 quote=Kaylor's Secret Desires. --> ''Epithalamion'' in Kaylor ''Secreted Desires'', pp 161\u2013205]</ref><ref>''Victorian Poetry'' 40.2 (2002), pp. 157\u2013187.</ref>\n\nSome critics have argued that homoerotic readings are either highly tendentious, or that they can be classified under the broader category of \"[[homosociality]]\", over the gender, sexual-specific \"homosexual\" term. Hopkins's journal writings, they argue, offer a clear admiration for feminised beauty. In his book ''Hopkins Reconstructed'' (2000), Justus George Lawler criticises Robert Martin's controversial biography ''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'' (1991) by suggesting that Martin \"cannot see the heterosexual beam... for the homosexual biographical mote in his own eye... it amounts to a slanted [[eisegesis]]\". The poems that elicit homoerotic readings can be read not merely as exercises in sublimation but as powerful renditions of religious conviction, a conviction that caused strain in his family and even led him to burn some poems that he felt were unnecessarily self-centred. Julia Saville's book ''A Queer Chivalry'' views the religious imagery in the poems as Hopkins's way of expressing the tension with homosexual identity and desire.\n\n[[Christopher Ricks]] notes that Hopkins engaged in a number of penitential practices, \"but all of these self-inflictions were not self-inflictions to him, and they are his business \u2013 or are his understanding of what it was for him to be about his Father's business.\"<ref name=Ricks/> Ricks takes issue with Martin's apparent lack of appreciation of the importance of the role of Hopkins's religious commitment to his writing, and cautions against assigning a priority of influence to any sexual instincts over other factors such as Hopkins's estrangement from his family.<ref name=Ricks/> Biographer Paul Mariani finds in Hopkins poems \"an irreconcilable tension \u2013 on the one hand, the selflessness demanded by Jesuit discipline; on the other, the seeming self-indulgence of poetic creation.\"<ref name=Domestico>[https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/inscape-instress-distress?_ga=1.190997742.596395981.1472016212 Domestico, Anthony. \"Inscape, Instress & Distress\", ''Commonweal'', March 9, 2009]</ref>\n\n====Isolation====\nHopkins spent the last five years of his life as a classics professor at University College Dublin. Hopkins's isolation in 1885 was multiple: a Jesuit distanced from his Anglican family and his homeland, an Englishman teaching in Dublin during a time of political strife, an unpublished poet striving to reconcile his artistic and religious callings.<ref name=Allbery/> The poem \"To seem the stranger\" was written in Ireland between 1885 and 1886 and is a poem of isolation and loneliness.<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-seem-the-stranger-lies-my-lot-my-life/ Hopkins, Gerard M. \"To seem the stranger lies my lot, my life\", Poemhunter.com]</ref>\n\n==Influence on others==\nRicks called Hopkins \"the most original poet of the Victorian age.\"<ref name=Ricks>[https://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-art-and-faith-of-Gerard-Manley-Hopkins-4424 Ricks, Christopher. \"The art and faith of Gerard Manley Hopkins\", ''The New Criterion'', September 1991]</ref> Hopkins is considered as influential as [[T.

Historians agree that the fate of Jerusalem and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was of concern to if not the immediate goal of papal policy in 1095. The idea of taking Jerusalem gained more focus as the Crusade was underway. The rebuilt church site was taken from the Fatimids (who had recently taken it from the Abassids) by the [[knight]]s of the [[First Crusade]] on 15 July 1099.<ref name=\"Morris 2005\"/>\n\nThe First Crusade was envisioned as an armed [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]], and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre. Crusader Prince [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who became the first [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|crusader monarch of Jerusalem]], decided not to use [[List of kings of Jerusalem|the title \"king\"]] during his lifetime, and declared himself \"Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri\" (\"Protector [or Defender] of the Holy Sepulchre\"). By the crusader period, a [[cistern]] under the former basilica was rumoured to have been where Helena found the True Cross, and began to be venerated as such; the cistern later became the \"Chapel of the Invention of the Cross\", but there is no evidence of the rumour before the 11th century, and modern archaeological investigation has now dated the cistern to 11th-century repairs by Monomachos.<ref name=\"Corbo\"/>\n\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|Crusader [[graffiti]] in the church]]\nAccording to the German clergyman and orient pilgrim Ludolf von Sudheim, the keys of the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre were in hands of the \"ancient [[Georgians]]\" and the food, alms, candles and oil for lamps were given them by the pilgrims in the south door of the church.<ref>''Venetian Adventurer: The Life and Times of Marco Polo,'' p. 88</ref>\n\n[[William of Tyre]], chronicler of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], reports on the renovation of the Church in the mid-12th century.

Two main east-west roads were built rather than the typical one, due to the awkward location of the Temple Mount, blocking the central east-west route.]]\nThe site of the church [[#History|had been a temple to Jupiter or Venus]] built by Hadrian before Constantine's edifice was built. Hadrian's temple had been located there because it was the junction of the [[Cardo|main north-south road]] with one of the two [[Decumanus Maximus|main east-west roads]] and directly adjacent to the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] (now the location of the [[Muristan]], which is smaller than the former forum). The forum itself had been placed, as is traditional in Roman towns, at the junction of the main north-south road with the other main east-west road (which is now El-Bazar/David Street). The temple and forum together took up the entire space between the two main east-west roads (a few above-ground remains of the east end of the temple precinct still survive in the Alexander Nevsky Church complex of the ''Russian Mission in Exile'').<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.generationword.com/jerusalem101/52-holy-sepulcher.html | title= Church of the Holy Sepulcher |website= Generation Word | access-date= 31 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nFrom the archaeological excavations in the 1970s, it is clear that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the ''Triportico'' and ''Rotunda'' roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least as far back as the Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further. [[Virgilio Canio Corbo]], a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall of the temple itself would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any tomb would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.<ref name=\"Corbo\"/>\n\nOther archaeologists have criticized Corbo's reconstructions. [[Dan Bahat]], the former city archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, as there is no known temple of [[Aphrodite]] (Venus) matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the temple building was on a platform raised high enough to avoid including anything sited where the Aedicule is now; indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda was not based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.<ref name=\"BahatBAR\">{{cite journal| first=Dan| last=Bahat| title=Does the Holy Sepulchre Church Mark the Burial of Jesus?| url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&Volume=12&Issue=3&ArticleID=1| journal=[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]| date=May\u2013June 1986| accessdate=19 September 2014}}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\n[[File:The Holy Sepulchre by Louis Haghe.jpg|thumb|1842 lithograph based on artwork by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], in ''[[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]'']]\nThe New Testament describes Jesus's tomb as being outside the city wall,<ref>for example, {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|13:12|}}</ref> as was normal for burials across the ancient world, which were regarded as unclean.<ref>Toynbee, Jocelyn M.

By the crusader period, a [[cistern]] under the former basilica was rumoured to have been where Helena found the True Cross, and began to be venerated as such; the cistern later became the \"Chapel of the Invention of the Cross\", but there is no evidence of the rumour before the 11th century, and modern archaeological investigation has now dated the cistern to 11th-century repairs by Monomachos.<ref name=\"Corbo\"/>\n\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|Crusader [[graffiti]] in the church]]\nAccording to the German clergyman and orient pilgrim Ludolf von Sudheim, the keys of the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre were in hands of the \"ancient [[Georgians]]\" and the food, alms, candles and oil for lamps were given them by the pilgrims in the south door of the church.<ref>''Venetian Adventurer: The Life and Times of Marco Polo,'' p. 88</ref>\n\n[[William of Tyre]], chronicler of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], reports on the renovation of the Church in the mid-12th century.

Two main east-west roads were built rather than the typical one, due to the awkward location of the Temple Mount, blocking the central east-west route.]]\nThe site of the church [[#History|had been a temple to Jupiter or Venus]] built by Hadrian before Constantine's edifice was built. Hadrian's temple had been located there because it was the junction of the [[Cardo|main north-south road]] with one of the two [[Decumanus Maximus|main east-west roads]] and directly adjacent to the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] (now the location of the [[Muristan]], which is smaller than the former forum). The forum itself had been placed, as is traditional in Roman towns, at the junction of the main north-south road with the other main east-west road (which is now El-Bazar/David Street). The temple and forum together took up the entire space between the two main east-west roads (a few above-ground remains of the east end of the temple precinct still survive in the Alexander Nevsky Church complex of the ''Russian Mission in Exile'').<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.generationword.com/jerusalem101/52-holy-sepulcher.html | title= Church of the Holy Sepulcher |website= Generation Word | access-date= 31 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nFrom the archaeological excavations in the 1970s, it is clear that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the ''Triportico'' and ''Rotunda'' roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least as far back as the Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further. [[Virgilio Canio Corbo]], a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall of the temple itself would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any tomb would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.<ref name=\"Corbo\"/>\n\nOther archaeologists have criticized Corbo's reconstructions. [[Dan Bahat]], the former city archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, as there is no known temple of [[Aphrodite]] (Venus) matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the temple building was on a platform raised high enough to avoid including anything sited where the Aedicule is now; indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda was not based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.<ref name=\"BahatBAR\">{{cite journal| first=Dan| last=Bahat| title=Does the Holy Sepulchre Church Mark the Burial of Jesus?| url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&Volume=12&Issue=3&ArticleID=1| journal=[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]| date=May\u2013June 1986| accessdate=19 September 2014}}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\n[[File:The Holy Sepulchre by Louis Haghe.jpg|thumb|1842 lithograph based on artwork by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], in ''[[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]'']]\nThe New Testament describes Jesus's tomb as being outside the city wall,<ref>for example, {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|13:12|}}</ref> as was normal for burials across the ancient world, which were regarded as unclean.<ref>Toynbee, Jocelyn M.

Kalpi is the daughter of a maid, Kamla Jadhav ([[Shilpa Shirodkar]]), and a mill worker, Vitthal Jadhav (Mohit Dagga). Her mother's dream is to become a part of the middle class so she works tirelessly. Kalpana selflessly loves her mother, but is deprived of her love and attention because Kamla is always busy looking after family members of her employers, mostly Pakhi Kapoor (Shirina Singh).\n\nRaghav Singhania is a rich businessman whose mission is to take revenge from the Kapoors who murdered his father. Raghav has always been in debt to Kamla as she helped him escape from the Kapoors who wanted to adopt him and take away all his wealth. He becomes attracted to Kalpi's sweet, simple and caring nature and falls in love with her. Eventually, Kalpana recognizes Raghav's feelings and reciprocates. Raghav and Kalpana fall in love, and with the blessing of their parents, plan their wedding.\n\nOn the day of his wedding to Kalpi, Raghav marries Pakhi Kapoor instead. Eventually, Raghav realizes his mistake but cannot rectify it because his mother, Gauri, wants him to use his marriage to Pakhi in her plans against the Kapoors. In order to prove his love for Kalpi, he marries her by putting the ''[[sindoor]]'' on her forehead in a temple.\n\nPaakhi hires goons to kidnap Kalpi and keep her in a remote location. Later, Raghav learns where Paakhi is hiding Kalpi and rescues her. A car chase ensues in which the car drives off a cliff and blows up. Some fishermen find Kalpi in the river and take her to a hospital; Raghav is still missing. While in the hospital, Dhiraj Diwan is depressed over his niece Suhana's ([[Asha Negi]]) death. When he hears how Kalpi's face has been burned and that she has lost her memory, he requests the doctor to perform a plastic surgery procedure to make Kalpi look like Suhana. The surgery is successful. Suhana has flashbacks of her real family, the accident and struggles to believe she is indeed Suhana Diwan.\n\nOn the day Suhana is to marry Aryan (Kunal Varma), she realizes that she is Kalpi and she marries Raghav instead. \n<!--As an Encyclopedia, Wikipedia provides a plot SUMMARY not a recreation of every plot twist.

Kalpi is the daughter of a maid, Kamla Jadhav ([[Shilpa Shirodkar]]), and a mill worker, Vitthal Jadhav (Mohit Dagga). Her mother's dream is to become a part of the middle class so she works tirelessly. Kalpana selflessly loves her mother, but is deprived of her love and attention because Kamla is always busy looking after family members of her employers, mostly Pakhi Kapoor (Shirina Singh).\n\nRaghav Singhania is a rich businessman whose mission is to take revenge from the Kapoors who murdered his father. Raghav has always been in debt to Kamla as she helped him escape from the Kapoors who wanted to adopt him and take away all his wealth. He becomes attracted to Kalpi's sweet, simple and caring nature and falls in love with her. Eventually, Kalpana recognizes Raghav's feelings and reciprocates. Raghav and Kalpana fall in love, and with the blessing of their parents, plan their wedding.\n\nOn the day of his wedding to Kalpi, Raghav gets married to Pakhi Kapoor instead. Eventually, Raghav realizes his mistake but cannot rectify it because his mother, Gauri, wants him to use his marriage to Pakhi in her plans against the Kapoors. In order to prove his love for Kalpi, he gets married to her by putting the ''[[sindoor]]'' on her forehead in a temple.\n\nPaakhi hires goons to kidnap Kalpi and keep her in a remote location. Later, Raghav learns where Paakhi is hiding Kalpi and rescues her. A car chase ensues in which the car drives off a cliff and blows up. Some fishermen find Kalpi in the river and take her to a hospital; Raghav is still missing. While in the hospital, Dhiraj Diwan is depressed over his niece Suhana's ([[Asha Negi]]) death. When he hears how Kalpi's face has been burned and that she has lost her memory, he requests the doctor to perform a plastic surgery procedure to make Kalpi look like Suhana. The surgery is successful. Suhana gets flashbacks of her real family, the accident and struggles to believe she is indeed Suhana Diwan.\n\nOn the day Suhana is to marry Aryan (Kunal Varma), she realizes that she is Kalpi and she gets married to Raghav instead. \n<!--As an Encyclopedia, Wikipedia provides a plot SUMMARY not a recreation of every plot twist.

Moon is primarily \"true father,\" probably the Messiah, and only secondarily a theologian. In an effort to systematize Moon's teachings, several members of the Unification Church in Korea have put together a developing theological system in Divine Principle which is impressive in its imaginative nature, coherence, and consistency, if not in its Christian orthodoxy. As the most complete expression of Moonist teachings to date, Divine Principle is the basic text of the Unification Church.4 The two major divisions of the system are the doctrines of Creation and Restoration. There are many subsets to these major divisions, but Creation and Restoration are the foci for the Moonist theological system.\"</ref> Moon was intent on replacing worldwide forms of Christianity with his new unified vision of it,<ref name=\"WP Obit\"/> Moon being a self-declared [[messiah]]; in effect, the [[Second Coming of Jesus]].

Central to Unification teachings is the concept that [[fall of man|fallen humanity]] can be restored to [[God]] only through a messiah, who comes as a new [[Adam]] to become the new head of the human race, replacing the sinful parents, through whom mankind can be reborn into God's family. According to the religion, Jesus is this messiah,<ref name=\"Sontag102\"/> but his premature execution (before he could start a family) meant that his messianic role as the head of a sinless new humanity was passed on to Moon.\n\nIn 1980 Unification theologian [[Young Oon Kim]] wrote:\n{{quote|Unification theology teaches that Jesus came to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth. As St. Paul wrote, Jesus was to be the new Adam restoring the lost garden of Eden. For this purpose he chose twelve apostles, symbolizing the original twelve tribes of Israel, and sent out seventy disciples, symbolizing all the nations of the world. Like John the Baptist, Jesus proclaimed that the long-awaited kingdom of heaven was at hand (Matt. 4:17).  Jesus was appointed God's earthly representative in order to subjugate Satan, cleanse men of original sin and free them from the power of evil. Christ's mission involved liberation from sin and raising mankind to the perfection stage. His purpose was to bring about the kingdom of heaven in our world with the help of men filled with divine truth and love. Jesus' goal was to restore the garden of Eden, a place of joy and beauty in which true families of perfected parents would dwell with God in a full relationship of reciprocal love.<ref>Kim, Young Oon, 1980, [http://www.religious.org/ucbooks/UTheol/toc.htm Unification Theology], Barrytown, NY: [[Unification Theological Seminary]], Library of Congress Cataloging number 80-52872</ref>}}\n\nThe Unification movement view of Jesus has been criticized by mainstream Christian authors and theologians. In their influential book ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'' (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the ''Divine Principle'' on the issues of the [[divinity of Christ]], the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], the Unification Church's belief that Jesus should have married and a literal [[resurrection of Jesus]] as well as a literal [[Second Coming]].  They add: \"Moon makes all men equal in 'divinity' to Jesus, thereby striking a blow at the uniqueness of Christ.\"<ref>Walter Ralston Martin, Ravi K. Zacharias, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', Bethany House, 2003, {{ISBN|0764228218}}  pages 368-370</ref>\n\nThe ''Divine Principle'' responds to this criticism  by saying:\n{{quote|There is no greater value than that of a person who has realized the ideal of creation. This is the value of Jesus, who surely attained the highest imaginable value.

When someone has lost his original position or state, he must make some condition to be restored to it. The making of such conditions of restitution is called indemnity. .... God's work to restore people to their true, unfallen state by having them fulfill indemnity conditions is called the providence of restoration through indemnity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Exposition of the Divine Principle''</ref>}}\n\nThe ''Divine Principle'' goes on to explain three types of indemnity conditions. Equal conditions of indemnity pay back the full value of what was lost. The [[Bible|biblical]] verse \"life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth\" (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example of an equal indemnity condition. Lesser conditions of indemnity provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. [[Faith]], [[baptism]], and the [[eucharist]] are mentioned as examples of lesser indemnity conditions. Greater conditions of indemnity come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid to make up for the earlier failure. [[Abraham]]'s attempted sacrifice of his son [[Isaac]] (Gen. 22:1-18) and the [[Israelites]]' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under [[Moses]] (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples of greater indemnity conditions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a \"just and righteous\" God to work through mankind. [[Jesus]]' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and [[Christianity]]'s history of [[martyr]]dom are mentioned as examples of this.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then states that human beings, not God or the [[angel]]s, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.<ref>Yamamoto, J.

For this purpose he chose twelve apostles, symbolizing the original twelve tribes of Israel, and sent out seventy disciples, symbolizing all the nations of the world. Like John the Baptist, Jesus proclaimed that the long-awaited kingdom of heaven was at hand (Matt. 4:17).  Jesus was appointed God's earthly representative in order to subjugate Satan, cleanse men of original sin and free them from the power of evil. Christ's mission involved liberation from sin and raising mankind to the perfection stage. His purpose was to bring about the kingdom of heaven in our world with the help of men filled with divine truth and love. Jesus' goal was to restore the garden of Eden, a place of joy and beauty in which true families of perfected parents would dwell with God in a full relationship of reciprocal love.<ref>Kim, Young Oon, 1980, [http://www.religious.org/ucbooks/UTheol/toc.htm Unification Theology], Barrytown, NY: [[Unification Theological Seminary]], Library of Congress Cataloging number 80-52872</ref>}}\n\nThe Unification movement view of Jesus has been criticized by mainstream Christian authors and theologians. In their influential book ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'' (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the ''Divine Principle'' on the issues of the [[divinity of Christ]], the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], the Unification Church's belief that Jesus should have married and a literal [[resurrection of Jesus]] as well as a literal [[Second Coming]].  They add: \"Moon makes all men equal in 'divinity' to Jesus, thereby striking a blow at the uniqueness of Christ.\"<ref>Walter Ralston Martin, Ravi K.

Indemnity is that which people do to restore themselves to God's kingdom. [[Young Oon Kim]] describes it this way: 'We atone for our sins through specific acts of penance.'

When someone has lost his original position or state, he must make some condition to be restored to it. The making of such conditions of restitution is called indemnity. .... God's work to restore people to their true, unfallen state by having them fulfill indemnity conditions is called the providence of restoration through indemnity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Exposition of the Divine Principle''</ref>}}\n\nThe ''Divine Principle'' goes on to explain three types of indemnity conditions. Equal conditions of indemnity pay back the full value of what was lost. The [[Bible|biblical]] verse \"life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth\" (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example of an equal indemnity condition. Lesser conditions of indemnity provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. [[Faith]], [[baptism]], and the [[eucharist]] are mentioned as examples of lesser indemnity conditions. Greater conditions of indemnity come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid to make up for the earlier failure. [[Abraham]]'s attempted sacrifice of his son [[Isaac]] (Gen. 22:1-18) and the [[Israelites]]' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under [[Moses]] (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples of greater indemnity conditions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a \"just and righteous\" God to work through mankind. [[Jesus]]' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and [[Christianity]]'s history of [[martyr]]dom are mentioned as examples of this.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then states that human beings, not God or the [[angel]]s, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.<ref>Yamamoto, J.
