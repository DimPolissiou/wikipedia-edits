Dino is a relatively small dinosaur, only slightly larger than the humans of his time, smaller than [[mammoth]]s that appear in the series, and much smaller than the numerous sauropods that appear as work animals in the series (a full-sized sauropod appears as a crane in the opening sequence, and oversized \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] ribs\" the size of an automobile are seen in the closing credits).\n\nA recurring gag in the series is Fred coming home from work, and Dino gets excited and knocks him down and licks his face. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. Dino frequently exhibits human emotions, nearly \"talking,\" and can also be moved to anger, at which point he snarls and snaps, especially when Fred tries to lie either to or in front of him, which he can always tell. He also loves to play with [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], the Flintstones' and Rubbles' respective offspring; these characters are introduced in the middle part of the series. In the episode \"Hop Happy\" Dino meets Hoppy, the Rubbles' new pet hopperoo. At first, Dino and Fred get scared, thinking he's a giant mouse, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy helps Dino rescue their owners in an accident.\n\nAlthough he is usually immune, Dino does take a couple of brief stabs at romance.  The first comes in the episode, \"Dino Goes Hollyrock\", which originally aired on September 14, 1962.  In it, Dino falls in love with female TV star sauropod \"Sassie\" (an obvious takeoff on \"[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]\") and then becomes her co-star on her TV show.  However, after she removes her false eyelashes and wig, he is shocked that she turned out to be an ugly, talented sauropod that could be beautified.  The second comes in the episode, \"Dino and Juliet\", which originally aired on November 26, 1964.  In it, Dino falls in love with the new neighbor's female sauropod (Juliet).  Their romance, which results in the birth of 15 puppies, helps end the feud between Fred and the new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock.\n\nAlthough Dino had already appeared earlier in the series' first season (such as the episode \"No Help Wanted\" and \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\" - these episodes were made after the \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" but aired before), Dino is portrayed quite differently in the first season's 18th episode \"The Snorkasaurus Hunter.\" In this episode, Fred and his friend [[Barney Rubble]] are on a camping trip, trying to hunt a snorkasaurus. Unlike Dino's other appearances, the snorkasaurus in this episode speaks and behaves toward Fred and Barney in a manner similar to comedian [[Phil Silvers]]. At the end of the episode, the Flintstones take in the dinosaur; the snorkasaurus (called \"Dino\" at one point by Wilma) is seen acting like a butler for the Flintstones: answering the telephone, dusting, and ironing. Dino in this episode also has purple skin instead of his varying pink-to-red color, which seems to vary from episode-to-episode during this early period, but is permanently purple after this episode. After this episode, Dino is permanently portrayed as behaving in a doglike fashion.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580278/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513034318/http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nDino's origins are explained in the episode \"Dino Disappears\", which originally aired on October 10, 1963.  In it, Wilma states that Dino followed Fred home because Fred was playing with him.  Fred counters by saying he was merely trying to chase him away. This seems to refer to the episode \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" where Fred and Barney's playing was actually hunting him down and Dino's following him was actually Dino sneaking onto the car.\n\nPost-original series, Dino appears in most of the series' spinoffs, except during the first season of ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''. There, Dino is replaced by Wooly, a dwarf mammoth, as the Flintstone family's pet. However, starting with the following series' ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'', Dino once again becomes a regular character.\n\nIn the 1980-1982 series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'', Dino is featured in his own segment, \"[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)#Dino and Cavemouse|Dino and Cavemouse]],\" where Dino tries futilely to capture a pesky [[mouse]] in the Flintstone household. The segments bear some similarities to classic cat-and-mouse cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. Dino later appears as a puppy in 1986-1988 series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (including his own segment, \"Dino's Dilemmas\"), as Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's babysitter in the short-lived 1996 series ''[[Cave Kids]]'', and also starred in his own two 7-minute short cartoons, ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997).\n\n==Other media==\n[[File:Dino Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dino statue (right), along with [[Fred Flintstone]] (left).]]\nDino appears in both live-action movies. He isn't seen very often in the first film, 1994's ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]''. Dino was created with both computer-generated imagery and as a puppet from [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], while archival audio from the original series was used to serve as Dino's voice.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nHowever, in the second film, 2000's ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'', Dino has more screen time; he appears here as a puppy. Fred won Dino's egg as a prize after winning a carnival game. Initially, Fred didn't think much of the egg as he felt that the creatures inside never live long. On a [[Ferris wheel]], just as Fred and Wilma are about to kiss, Dino's egg hatches and he takes an immediate attachment to Fred, believing him to be his mother. (This, of course, contradicts Dino's origin in the original series.)\n\n==Filmography==\n===Television shows===\n* ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960\u20131966)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'' (1972\u20131974)\n* ''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]'' (1977\u20131978)\n* ''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' (1979\u20131980)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'' (1980\u20131982)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]'' (1982\u20131984)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (1986\u20131988)\n* ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' \u2013 featuring ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Cave Kids]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]'' (2020)\n\n===Films and Specials===\n* ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Energy: A National Issue]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[A Flintstone Christmas]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Little Big League]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Fred's Final Fling]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Wind-Up Wilma]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Jogging Fever]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Kids' \"Just Say No\" Special]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Hanna-Barbera's 50th: A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration|A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration: 50 Years of Hanna-Barbera]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[I Yabba-Dabba Do!]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Hollyrock-a-Bye Baby]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[A Flintstones Christmas Carol]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: On the Rocks]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[The Flintstones & WWE: Stone Age SmackDown!]]'' (2015)\n\n==Portrayal==\nDino's barks and sound effects were provided by [[Mel Blanc]] for 27 years, from 1960\u20131987; archive audio of Blanc was used for Dino in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action film]] and [[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas|its prequel in 2000]].

He is a pet dinosaur of the series' main characters, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Wilma Flintstone]].<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 15 things you don't know|work= Daily Telegraph |date=2010-09-30|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034627/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-15-things-you-dont-know.html|accessdate=2010-10-01|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> Dino debuted in the opening credits of the pilot episode of ''The Flintstones'', but is not mentioned by name until the first season's fourth episode, \"No Help Wanted.\"\n\n==Background==\nIn the series, Dino serves the role of a pet dog, and exhibits the characteristics of a typical domesticated canine.\n\nDino is a [[prosauropod]]-like [[dinosaur]], a Snorkasaurus. Dino is a relatively small dinosaur, only slightly larger than the humans of his time, smaller than [[mammoth]]s that appear in the series, and much smaller than the numerous sauropods that appear as work animals in the series (a full-sized sauropod appears as a crane in the opening sequence, and oversized \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] ribs\" the size of an automobile are seen in the closing credits).\n\nA recurring gag in the series is Fred coming home from work, and Dino gets excited and knocks him down and licks his face. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. Dino frequently exhibits human emotions, nearly \"talking,\" and can also be moved to anger, at which point he snarls and snaps, especially when Fred tries to lie either to or in front of him, which he can always tell. He also loves to play with [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], the Flintstones' and Rubbles' respective offspring; these characters are introduced in the middle part of the series. In the episode \"Hop Happy\" Dino meets Hoppy, the Rubbles' new pet hopperoo. At first, Dino and Fred get scared, thinking he's a giant mouse, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy helps Dino rescue their owners in an accident.\n\nAlthough he is usually immune, Dino does take a couple of brief stabs at romance.  The first comes in the episode, \"Dino Goes Hollyrock\", which originally aired on September 14, 1962.  In it, Dino falls in love with female TV star sauropod \"Sassie\" (an obvious takeoff on \"[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]\") and then becomes her co-star on her TV show.  However, after she removes her false eyelashes and wig, he is shocked that she turned out to be an ugly, talented sauropod that could be beautified.  The second comes in the episode, \"Dino and Juliet\", which originally aired on November 26, 1964.  In it, Dino falls in love with the new neighbor's female sauropod (Juliet).  Their romance, which results in the birth of 15 puppies, helps end the feud between Fred and the new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock.\n\nAlthough Dino had already appeared earlier in the series' first season (such as the episode \"No Help Wanted\" and \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\" - these episodes were made after the \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" but aired before), Dino is portrayed quite differently in the first season's 18th episode \"The Snorkasaurus Hunter.\" In this episode, Fred and his friend [[Barney Rubble]] are on a camping trip, trying to hunt a snorkasaurus. Unlike Dino's other appearances, the snorkasaurus in this episode speaks and behaves toward Fred and Barney in a manner similar to comedian [[Phil Silvers]]. At the end of the episode, the Flintstones take in the dinosaur; the snorkasaurus (called \"Dino\" at one point by Wilma) is seen acting like a butler for the Flintstones: answering the telephone, dusting, and ironing. Dino in this episode also has purple skin instead of his varying pink-to-red color, which seems to vary from episode-to-episode during this early period, but is permanently purple after this episode. After this episode, Dino is permanently portrayed as behaving in a doglike fashion.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580278/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513034318/http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nDino's origins are explained in the episode \"Dino Disappears\", which originally aired on October 10, 1963.  In it, Wilma states that Dino followed Fred home because Fred was playing with him.  Fred counters by saying he was merely trying to chase him away. This seems to refer to the episode \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" where Fred and Barney's playing was actually hunting him down and Dino's following him was actually Dino sneaking onto the car.\n\nPost-original series, Dino appears in most of the series' spinoffs, except during the first season of ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''. There, Dino is replaced by Wooly, a dwarf mammoth, as the Flintstone family's pet. However, starting with the following series' ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'', Dino once again becomes a regular character.\n\nIn the 1980-1982 series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'', Dino is featured in his own segment, \"[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)#Dino and Cavemouse|Dino and Cavemouse]],\" where Dino tries futilely to capture a pesky [[mouse]] in the Flintstone household. The segments bear some similarities to classic cat-and-mouse cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. Dino later appears as a puppy in 1986-1988 series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (including his own segment, \"Dino's Dilemmas\"), as Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's babysitter in the short-lived 1996 series ''[[Cave Kids]]'', and also starred in his own two 7-minute short cartoons, ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997).\n\n==Other media==\n[[File:Dino Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dino statue (right), along with [[Fred Flintstone]] (left).]]\nDino appears in both live-action movies. He isn't seen very often in the first film, 1994's ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]''. Dino was created with both computer-generated imagery and as a puppet from [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], while archival audio from the original series was used to serve as Dino's voice.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nHowever, in the second film, 2000's ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'', Dino has more screen time; he appears here as a puppy. Fred won Dino's egg as a prize after winning a carnival game. Initially, Fred didn't think much of the egg as he felt that the creatures inside never live long. On a [[Ferris wheel]], just as Fred and Wilma are about to kiss, Dino's egg hatches and he takes an immediate attachment to Fred, believing him to be his mother.

Carrillo.png|right|thumb|A 2003 drawing showcasing the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform in desert and woodland camouflage variants]]\n\n'''MARPAT''' (short for '''Marine pattern''')<ref>https://olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_clothing_marpat.php</ref> is a [[multi-scale camouflage]] pattern in use with the [[United States Marine Corps]], designed in 2001 and introduced from late 2002 to early 2005 with the [[Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform]] (MCCUU), which replaced the [[Battle Dress Uniform|Camouflage Utility Uniform]]. Its design and concept are based on the Canadian [[CADPAT]] pattern. The pattern is formed of small rectangular pixels of color. In theory, it is a far more effective camouflage than standard uniform patterns because it mimics the dappled textures and rough boundaries found in natural settings. It is also known as the \"digital pattern\" or \"digi-cammies\" because of its micropattern (pixels) rather than the old macropattern (big blobs).\n\nThe United States government has [[patent]]ed MARPAT, including specifics of its manufacture.<ref name=\"main\">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6805957|title=Camouflage U.S. Marine corps utility uniform: pattern, fabric, and design|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129081629/https://www.google.com/patents/US6805957|archivedate=29 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> By regulation, the pattern and items incorporating it, such as the MCCUU and [[ILBE]] backpack, are to be supplied by authorized manufacturers only and are not for general commercial sale, although imitations are available such as \"'''Digital Woodland Camo'''\" or \"'''Digital Desert Camo'''\".\n\nMARPAT was also chosen because it distinctively identifies its wearers as Marines to their adversaries, while simultaneously helping its wearers remain concealed. This was demonstrated by a Marine spokesman at the launch of MARPAT, who stated: \"We want to be instantly recognized as a force to be reckoned with. We want them to see us coming a mile away in our new uniforms.\"<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Blechman | first1 = Hardy | last2 =Newman | first2 =Alex | title= DPM: Disruptive Pattern Material | year=2004 | publisher= Department of Publications, Maharishi | isbn = 0-9543404-0-X}}</ref> As such, the U.S. Marine Corps restricts use of the camouflage, preventing its use in most other divisions of the United States military with the exception of some elements of the U.S. Navy.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Unif703.jpg|thumb|upright|A U.S. Marine showcasing the MCCUU in woodland MARPAT in 2001]]\n\nMARPAT was designed by [[Timothy O'Neill (camoufleur)|Timothy O'Neill]], Anabela Dugas,<ref name=patentMARPAT/> Kenneth G.

In [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops used various patterns similar to the current German ''[[Flecktarn]]'', which involved similar small dabs of color on a uniform to provide camouflage.\n\nThe Canadian Forces originally developed the pattern called [[CADPAT]], on which MARPAT was based.<ref>{{cite web |last1=King |first1=A. |title=The Digital Revolution: Camouflage Uniforms In The Twenty-First Century |url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/17154/Camouflage%2520millennium.docx |publisher=University of Exeter |accessdate=29 March 2016 |date=2014 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Timothy O'Neill (camoufleur)|Timothy O'Neill]]'s<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fusco |first1=Sgt.

Henley and then John Joseph Heisterman, Jr. (both active duty [[United States Marine Corps Scout Sniper|U.S. Marine Scout Snipers]]), went through over 150 different camo patterns before selecting three samples that met their initial objectives. These were two versions of [[tigerstripe]] and an older design of [[Rhodesian Brushstroke]]. The influence of tigerstripe can still be seen in the final MARPAT. These three samples were then reconstructed using new shapes and unique color blends that would allow a more effective uniform in a great range of environments.\n\nThe new patterns were then field tested in different environments, day and night, with night vision and various optics. MARPAT did exceptionally well in their wet uniform test when viewed with night vision while illuminated with IR, where normally patterns appear as a solid. The MARPAT patent lists U.S. Army research into [[fractal]] pattern camouflage as the basis for MARPAT.\n\nThe MARPAT pattern was chosen in a run-off against seven other patterns at the USMC [[Scout Sniper]] Instructor School.<ref name=\"tecom.usmc.mil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/mcub/utility/background/CammieConsid.htm |title=Combat Utility Uniform Camouflage Considerations |website=www.tecom.usmc.mil |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010920015716/http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/mcub/utility/background/CammieConsid.htm |archivedate=2001-09-20 }}</ref>\n\nPreliminary development of MARPAT began in April 2000,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/650/648951.pdf|date=September 2012|format=PDF|work=Report to Congressional Requesters|publisher=United States Government Accountability Office|author=United States Government Accountability Office|title=Warfighter Support: DOD Should Improve Development of Camouflage Uniforms and Enhance Collaboration Among the Services|access-date=3 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615172055/https://www.gao.gov/assets/650/648951.pdf|archivedate=15 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> with field testing of the pattern and the MCCUU beginning in 2001.

A modified version of Vietnam War\u2013era tiger stripe also made it to final trials but was eliminated due to MARPAT being superior in all environments. The purpose of the digitized pattern is to create visual \"noise\" and prevent the eye from identifying any visual templates. Thus, the pattern is intended to not register as any particular shape or pattern that could be distinguished.<ref>Kenneth G. Henley, [https://www.militarymorons.com/misc/camo.html \"MARPAT - A Personal Tale - From one of the designers of the Marine Pattern camouflage\"], ''MilitaryMorons'', Sept 2003</ref>\n\nThere were initially three MARPAT patterns tested: Woodland, Desert, and Urban. While keeping the rights for Urban, only the Woodland and Desert patterns were adopted by the Marine Corps for general issue, replacing the [[U.S. Woodland ]]pattern and the [[Desert Camouflage Uniform|U.S. Three-Color Desert pattern]]. Webbing and equipment worn with MARPAT Woodland and MARPAT Desert is produced in Coyote Brown, a mid-tone color common to both the woodland and desert patterns. Although a digital snow pattern has also been adopted on cold-weather training over-garments, this uses a different pattern from the Canadian company Hyperstealth.<ref>[http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/SITES/PMICE/InfoPapers/Clothing/SnowCamo.pdf Snow Camouflage Uniform data sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304135054/http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/SITES/PMICE/InfoPapers/Clothing/SnowCamo.pdf |date=4 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nAuthentic MARPAT material is distinguishable by a miniature \"[[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]]\" emblem incorporated into the pattern above the letters \"USMC\", in both the woodland and desert patterns.<ref name=\"Magna\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060630184420/http://www.magnafabrics.com/images/invprints/836.jpg Eagle, Globe and Anchor] example, Magna Fabrics.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"145px\">\nFile:3MCCUU.jpg|The three tested MARPAT patterns: Desert, Urban, and Woodland pattern\nFile:MARPAT MCCUU Prototypes Removable Sleeves.png|thumb|right|Two U.S. Marines test out early prototypes of the MCCUU in 2001.

After major questions about its effectiveness arose, the Army adopted the \"Scorpion W2\" [[Operational Camouflage Pattern]] in 2015, to be fully phased in by 2019.\n\nThe [[United States Air Force]] has designed its own [[Airman Battle Uniform]] (ABU) using a standard tiger stripe pattern and slight variation on the color scheme of ACU, also designed to be phased out by the OCP uniform by 2021.\n\nThe [[United States Navy]] announced approval for a digital \"BDU-style\" work uniform in late 2008. The [[Uniforms of the United States Navy#Navy Working Uniform|Navy Working Uniform]] (NWU) was chosen by surveyed sailors for consistency and longer life, while the blue-grey-black Type I pattern was designed for aesthetic purposes rather than camouflage to disguise them at sea.

Its design and concept are based on the Canadian [[CADPAT]] pattern. The pattern is formed of small rectangular pixels of color. In theory, it is a far more effective camouflage than standard uniform patterns because it mimics the dappled textures and rough boundaries found in natural settings. It is also known as the \"digital pattern\" or \"digi-cammies\" because of its micropattern (pixels) rather than the old macropattern (big blobs).\n\nThe United States government has [[patent]]ed MARPAT, including specifics of its manufacture.<ref name=\"main\">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6805957|title=Camouflage U.S. Marine corps utility uniform: pattern, fabric, and design|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129081629/https://www.google.com/patents/US6805957|archivedate=29 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> By regulation, the pattern and items incorporating it, such as the MCCUU and [[ILBE]] backpack, are to be supplied by authorized manufacturers only and are not for general commercial sale, although imitations are available such as \"'''Digital Woodland Camo'''\" or \"'''Digital Desert Camo'''\".\n\nMARPAT was also chosen because it distinctively identifies its wearers as Marines to their adversaries, while simultaneously helping its wearers remain concealed. This was demonstrated by a Marine spokesman at the launch of MARPAT, who stated: \"We want to be instantly recognized as a force to be reckoned with. We want them to see us coming a mile away in our new uniforms.\"<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Blechman | first1 = Hardy | last2 =Newman | first2 =Alex | title= DPM: Disruptive Pattern Material | year=2004 | publisher= Department of Publications, Maharishi | isbn = 0-9543404-0-X}}</ref> As such, the U.S. Marine Corps restricts use of the camouflage, preventing its use in most other divisions of the United States military with the exception of some elements of the U.S. Navy.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Unif703.jpg|thumb|upright|A U.S. Marine showcasing the MCCUU in woodland MARPAT in 2001]]\n\nMARPAT was designed by [[Timothy O'Neill (camoufleur)|Timothy O'Neill]], Anabela Dugas,<ref name=patentMARPAT/> Kenneth G.

In [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops used various patterns similar to the current German ''[[Flecktarn]]'', which involved similar small dabs of color on a uniform to provide camouflage.\n\nThe Canadian Forces originally developed the pattern called [[CADPAT]], on which MARPAT was based.<ref>{{cite web |last1=King |first1=A. |title=The Digital Revolution: Camouflage Uniforms In The Twenty-First Century |url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/17154/Camouflage%2520millennium.docx |publisher=University of Exeter |accessdate=29 March 2016 |date=2014 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Timothy O'Neill (camoufleur)|Timothy O'Neill]]'s<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fusco |first1=Sgt.

Henley and then John Joseph Heisterman, Jr. (both active duty U.S. Marine Scout-Snipers), went through over 150 different camo patterns before selecting three samples that met their initial objectives. These were two versions of [[tigerstripe]] and an older design of [[Rhodesian Brushstroke]]. The influence of tigerstripe can still be seen in the final MARPAT. These three samples were then reconstructed using new shapes and unique color blends that would allow a more effective uniform in a great range of environments.\n\nThe new patterns were then field tested in different environments, day and night, with night vision and various optics. MARPAT did exceptionally well in their wet uniform test when viewed with night vision while illuminated with IR, where normally patterns appear as a solid. The MARPAT patent lists U.S. Army research into [[fractal]] pattern camouflage as the basis for MARPAT.\n\nThe MARPAT pattern was chosen in a run-off against seven other patterns at the USMC [[Scout Sniper]] Instructor School.<ref name=\"tecom.usmc.mil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/mcub/utility/background/CammieConsid.htm |title=Combat Utility Uniform Camouflage Considerations |website=www.tecom.usmc.mil |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010920015716/http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/mcub/utility/background/CammieConsid.htm |archivedate=2001-09-20 }}</ref>\n\nPreliminary development of MARPAT began in April 2000,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/650/648951.pdf|date=September 2012|format=PDF|work=Report to Congressional Requesters|publisher=United States Government Accountability Office|author=United States Government Accountability Office|title=Warfighter Support: DOD Should Improve Development of Camouflage Uniforms and Enhance Collaboration Among the Services|access-date=3 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615172055/https://www.gao.gov/assets/650/648951.pdf|archivedate=15 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> with field testing of the pattern and the MCCUU beginning in 2001.

A modified version of Vietnam War\u2013era tiger stripe also made it to final trials but was eliminated due to MARPAT being superior in all environments. The purpose of the digitized pattern is to create visual \"noise\" and prevent the eye from identifying any visual templates. Thus, the pattern is intended to not register as any particular shape or pattern that could be distinguished.<ref>Kenneth G. Henley, [https://www.militarymorons.com/misc/camo.html \"MARPAT - A Personal Tale - From one of the designers of the Marine Pattern camouflage\"], ''MilitaryMorons'', Sept 2003</ref>\n\nThere were initially three MARPAT patterns tested: Woodland, Desert, and Urban. While keeping the rights for Urban, only the Woodland and Desert patterns were adopted by the Marine Corps for general issue, replacing the [[U.S. Woodland ]]pattern and the [[Desert Camouflage Uniform|U.S. Three-Color Desert pattern]]. Webbing and equipment worn with MARPAT Woodland and MARPAT Desert is produced in Coyote Brown, a mid-tone color common to both the woodland and desert patterns. Although a digital snow pattern has also been adopted on cold-weather training over-garments, this uses a different pattern from the Canadian company Hyperstealth.<ref>[http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/SITES/PMICE/InfoPapers/Clothing/SnowCamo.pdf Snow Camouflage Uniform data sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304135054/http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/SITES/PMICE/InfoPapers/Clothing/SnowCamo.pdf |date=4 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nAuthentic MARPAT material is distinguishable by a miniature \"[[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]]\" emblem incorporated into the pattern above the letters \"USMC\", in both the woodland and desert patterns.<ref name=\"Magna\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060630184420/http://www.magnafabrics.com/images/invprints/836.jpg Eagle, Globe and Anchor] example, Magna Fabrics.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"145px\">\nFile:3MCCUU.jpg|The three tested MARPAT patterns: Desert, Urban, and Woodland pattern\nFile:MARPAT MCCUU Prototypes Removable Sleeves.png|thumb|right|Two U.S. Marines test out early prototypes of the MCCUU in 2001.

His mother was Muhammad's aunt, [[Safiyyah bint \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]], hence Al-Zubayr was Muhammad's first cousin.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|75}} He had two brothers, Sa'ib and Abdul Kaaba; a maternal brother, Safi ibn Al-Harith, who was from the Umayya clan;<ref name=\"Saad8\">Muhammad ibn Saad.

Safiya, who was pregnant at the time, had to carry the man home. When the passers-by asked what had happened, she told them, \"He fought Al-Zubayr. Did you find Al-Zubayr soft like cheese or dates or full of brass?\" That's when they knew that he would grow up to be strong during war.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|765}}\n\nAl-Awam died while Al-Zubayr was still young. His mother used to beat him severely. When it was said to her, \"You have killed him! You have wrenched his heart. Will you destroy the boy?\" she replied, \"I beat him so that he will be intelligent and will be bold in the battle.\"<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|76}}\n\nAl-Zubayr is described as of medium height, lean, dark-complexioned and hairy, though with a thin beard.

The ''Negus'' met the rebels on the banks of the Nile. The Muslims, greatly worried about losing their protector, delegated Al-Zubayr to be their news-bearer. Helped by an inflated waterskin, he swam down the Nile until he reached the point where the battle was being fought. He watched until the ''Negus'' had defeated the rebels, then swam back to the Muslims. He ran up waving his clothes and announced, \"Hurrah, the ''Negus'' has conquered and God has destroyed his enemies and established him in his land!\" The Muslims rejoiced.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|153}}\n\nAl-Zubayr was among those who returned to Mecca in 619 because they heard that the Meccans had converted to Islam. \"But when they got near to Mecca, they learned that the report was false, so that they entered the town under the protection of a citizen or by stealth.\"<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|167\u2013168}} However, Al-Zubayr did not name his protector.\n\nAl-Zubayr joined the general [[Hijra (Islam)|emigration]] to [[Medina]] in 622. At first he lodged with Al-Mundhir ibn Muhammad. It is disputed who became Al-Zubayr's \"brother\" in Islam: variant traditions name [[Abdullah, son of Masud|Abdullah ibn Masood]], [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]], Kaab ibn Malik and Salama ibn Salama.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|76\u201377}}<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|234}} Muhammad gave him a large plot of land to build his house and a grant of some palm trees.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|77}} In 625 Al-Zubayr was given more palm trees from the land of the expelled Nadir tribe.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|78}}\n\n==Military Activity under Muhammad==\n{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}\n{{Main|List of expeditions of Muhammad}}\nIt is said that Al-Zubayr joined all of Muhammad's military expeditions,<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|76}} typically dressed in a distinctive yellow turban.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|77}}\n\n===Badr===\n\nAt the [[Battle of Badr]] he was sent as a scout and he captured a Meccan spy.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|295}} He then fought in the battle<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|328}} and killed Ubayda ibn Sa'id of the Umayya.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|337}}\n\n===Uhud===\n\nAt the [[Battle of Uhud]] he volunteered to take up Muhammad's sword \"with its right,\" which was to \"smite the enemy with it until it bends,\" and was \"much mortified\" when Muhammad rejected his offer.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|373}} He was standing so close to the fleeing Meccan women that he could see [[Hind bint Utbah]]'s anklets.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|379}} But it was at that point that the battle turned; Al-Zubayr was one of the handful of men who stood beside Muhammad when the Muslims in their turn fled and who accompanied him to the glen. \"He was firm with him in the Battle of Uhud and he gave him allegiance to the death.\"<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|78}}<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|381}}\n\n===The Trench===\n\nDuring the [[Battle of the Trench]], Al-Zubayr rode a [[Roan (horse)|roan horse]]. He volunteered to bring news of the [[Banu Qurayza|Qurayza]] tribe to Muhammad, who responded, \"Every Prophet has a disciple, and my disciple is Al-Zubayr.\"<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|79}}\n\n===Khaybar===\n\nIn 628 Al-Zubayr joined the expedition to [[Battle of Khaybar|Khaybar]] and answered Yasir the Jew's challenge to single combat. His mother Safiya asked Muhammad, \"Will he kill my son?\" and Muhammad reassured her, \"No, your son will kill him, Allah willing.\" Al-Zubayr advanced reciting:\n\n<poem>\"''Khaybar, know that I am Zabbar,''\n''chief of a people no cowardly runaways,''\n''the son of those who defend their glory,''\n''the son of princes.''\n''O Yasir let not all the unbelievers deceive you,''\n''for all of them are like a slowly moving mirage.''\"</poem>\n\nThey fought, and Al-Zubayr killed Yasir. Afterwards the Muslims commented on how sharp his sword must have been; Al-Zubayr replied that it had not been sharp but he had used it with great force.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|513\u2013514}}\n\nAfter the Muslims had conquered [[Al-Qamus]], the Jewish treasurer, [[Kenana ibn al-Rabi|Kinana]], was brought to Muhammad, but he refused to reveal where their money was hidden.

When they could not find the letter in her baggage, they realised she must have concealed it on her person, so they talked her into it. The spy then produced the letter, which she had hidden in her hair, and Al-Zubayr and Ali brought it back to Muhammad, confident that the Muslims would now take Mecca by surprise.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|545}}\n\nWhen Muhammad entered Mecca, Al-Zubayr held one of the three banners of the Emigrants<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|78}} and commanded the left wing of the conquering army.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|549}} He also fought at the [[Battle of Hunayn]].<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|670}}\n\n==Career After Muhammad==\nIn the third week of July 632, the Caliph Abu Bakr scraped together an army mainly from the [[Banu Hashim]] (the clan of Muhammad) to defend Medina from an imminent invasion by the apostate forces of [[Tulayha]], a self-proclaimed prophet. The army included stalwarts like Zubayr, and Talha ibn Ubaidullah. Each of them was appointed as commander of one-third of the newly organised force.

He said that Ali had talked him out of it during the negotiations on the grounds that they were cousins; but his son accused him of fearing Ali's army. Al-Zubayr left the battle-field while Aisha continued to direct her troops. A man named [[Amr ibn Jarmouz|Amr ibn Jurmuz]] decided to track his movements and followed him to a nearby field. It was time for prayer so, after each had asked the other what he was doing there, they agreed to pray. While Al-Zubayr was prostrating, Amr ibn Jurmuz stabbed him in the neck and killed him.<ref name=\"Tabari16\"/>{{rp|111\u2013112,116,126,158\u2013159}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn his will Al-Zubayr had left a house for all of his divorced daughters.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|80}} He left a third of his property in bequests and instructed his son Abdullah to sell the rest of his property to pay off his debts, invoking [[Allah]] if any could not be paid.

Although Abdullah went to some trouble to settle all the debts, Al-Zubayr's four widows eventually inherited 1,100,000 each, leaving over 30,000,000 to be divided among his children.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|81\u201382}}\n\nAl-Zubayr ibn Al-Awam was one of the ten Muslims to whom Muhammad [[Hadith of the ten promised paradise|guaranteed Paradise]] while they were still alive.<ref>Abu Dawud 40:4632.</ref><ref>Tirmidhi #3747.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of expeditions of Muhammad]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20090530143431/http://zuberiassociation.org:80/{{cbignore}}\n*http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/44_ali_bin_talib.htm\n\n{{Ten companions of Muhammad}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\nhe wa strong\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zubayr Ibn Al-Awam}}\n[[Category:656 deaths]]\n[[Category:Male Sahabah]]\n[[Category:594 births]]\n[[Category:Sahabah martyrs]]\n[[Category:Converts to Islam]]\n[[Category:Sahabah participated in battle of Uhud]]\n[[Category:People of the First Fitna]]\n[[Category:Muslim conquest of Egypt]]\n[[Category:Banu Asad (Quraysh)]]\n[[Category:People of the Muslim conquest of the Levant]]\n", "name_user": "Ofisus", "label": "safe", "comment": "I corrected name Awam to Awwam", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zubayr_ibn_al-Awam"}
