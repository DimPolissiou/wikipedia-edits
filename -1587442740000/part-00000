Kara and Alex's new friend, Samantha Arias, is unknowingly another Kryptonian survivor, and begins a transformation from a loving single mother into the world-killing weapon known as Reign, who serves a coven headed by Selena.\n\nIn the [[Supergirl (season 4)|fourth season]], Kara deals with a new wave of anti-extraterrestrial prejudice secretly instigated by Lex Luthor from prison, forcing her to fight for the [[civil and political rights]] of aliens. [[Agent Liberty|Ben Lockwood]], a former college professor who suffered a series of personal tragedies at the hands of extraterrestrials, forms a human-first group called the Children of Liberty to end all aliens. Meanwhile, in the nation of [[Kasnia]], a clone of Kara dubbed \"Red Daughter\" is trained by its military to fight Supergirl at Lex's request. Kara and Alex rival with the DEO's new addition, Col. Lauren Haley, who was sent to monitor the DEO's progress under Alex's direction. Col. Haley and the President try to force Supergirl to reveal her identity, and clash with her and Alex when she refuses.\n\nIn the [[Supergirl (season 5)|fifth season]], Kara and co. find themselves facing a new threat known as Leviathan, who sends their agent Rama Khan, a centuries-old immortal being who can bend the Earth, to kill Kara but is eventually defeated with the help with her friends. After a [[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis]] involving the destruction of the multiverse, Kara adjusts her new life on the newly created universe \"Earth-Prime\", thanks to [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]]'s sacrifice to rebuild the multiverse, in which she is working for Lex, who now owns the D.E.O.\n{{:List of Supergirl episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n{{Main|List of Supergirl characters}}\n<!--Order based on pilot credits -->\n[[File:SDCC 2017 - Jeremy Jordan, Melissa Benoist and David Harewood 01 (cropped2).jpg   |right|thumb|150px|[[Melissa Benoist]] stars as the series' titular character, Supergirl.]]\n* [[Melissa Benoist]] as [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Danvers / Kara Zor-El / Supergirl]]: <br />A 24-year-old [[Kryptonian]] living in National City, who must embrace her powers after previously hiding them.

Krypton was exploding, and Kara's parents sent Kara in a spacecraft to Earth after her cousin. Kara was meant to protect her infant cousin Kal-El, but her spacecraft was knocked off course and forced into the [[Phantom Zone]], where it stayed for 24 years. By the time the spacecraft crash landed on Earth, Kal-El had grown up and become [[Superman]]. The series begins eleven years later when the now 24-year-old Kara is learning to embrace her powers and has adopted the superheroic alias \"Supergirl\".<ref name=\"DeadlineSep2014\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/09/supergirl-tv-series-cbs-dc-greg-berlati-ali-adler-836682/ |title='Supergirl' Drama From Greg Berlanti & Ali Adler Lands CBS Series Commitment |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=September 19, 2014 |accessdate=September 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919200127/http://deadline.com/2014/09/supergirl-tv-series-cbs-dc-greg-berlati-ali-adler-836682/ |archive-date=September 19, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP:TVPLOT. -->\nIn the [[Supergirl (season 1)|first season]], Kara is forced to reveal her powers, and becomes [[National City (DC Comics)|National City]]'s protector.<ref name=\"TVLineOct2014\">{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2014/10/30/supergirl-tv-show-cbs-casting/ |title=Meet CBS's Supergirl (''and'' Her Sister), Get Scoop on Kara's Big Entrance |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |work=TVLine |date=October 30, 2014 |accessdate=October 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030214639/http://tvline.com/2014/10/30/supergirl-tv-show-cbs-casting/ |archive-date=October 30, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kara discovers that hundreds of the criminals her mother imprisoned are hiding on Earth, including her aunt Astra and Astra's husband [[Non (comics)|Non]].

At the same time, Kara befriends Lillian's stepdaughter [[Lena Luthor]], the new CEO of [[LexCorp|LuthorCorp]], and struggles with romantic feelings for recent Earth arrival [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]], a princely survivor from Krypton's neighboring planet [[Daxam]] whose parents wish to reclaim him. James becomes the masked streetfighting vigilante [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]]; Alex begins dating [[Maggie Sawyer]]; and J'onn befriends a younger Martian, [[Miss Martian|M'gann]], from the [[White Martian]] race that killed his people.\n\nIn the [[Supergirl (season 3)|third season]], Kara struggles with the loss of Mon-El after he is forced to leave Earth. When Mon-El returns, he reveals that he has time-traveled to the 31st century and founded the [[Legion of Super-Heroes|Legion]], alongside marrying [[Saturn Girl|Imra Ardeen]]. J'onn discovers his father M'yrnn J'onzz is alive and Alex deals with her heartbreak after breaking up with Maggie. Kara and Alex's new friend, Samantha Arias, is unknowingly another Kryptonian survivor, and begins a transformation from a loving single mother into the world-killing weapon known as Reign, who serves a coven headed by Selena.\n\nIn the [[Supergirl (season 4)|fourth season]], Kara deals with a new wave of anti-extraterrestrial prejudice secretly instigated by Lex Luthor from prison, forcing her to fight for the [[civil and political rights]] of aliens. [[Agent Liberty|Ben Lockwood]], a former college professor who suffered a series of personal tragedies at the hands of extraterrestrials, forms a human-first group called the Children of Liberty to end all aliens. Meanwhile, in the nation of [[Kasnia]], a clone of Kara dubbed \"Red Daughter\" is trained by its military to fight Supergirl at Lex's request. Kara and Alex rival with the DEO's new addition, Col. Lauren Haley, who was sent to monitor the DEO's progress under Alex's direction. Col.

The projected requirement for the IAF was 200 single-seat fighters and 20 twin-seat trainers, while the IN expected to operate at least 40 single-seat fighters.

The vaulting with its carving is original but may have been re-constructed when 1792 the church was rebuilt and the chancel was encased with stonework, decorated in [[Romanesque Revival architecture in the United Kingdom|Romanesque revival style]]. The restored east end of the chancel has blind arcades of intersecting round-headed arches and engaged round shafts. Round-headed east window with stylized leaf-mouldings and billet-moulded hood mould continuing as frieze to either side. Taller, narrower window lights the priest's chamber which was above the chancel, but which is now blocked and inaccessible. Two orders of blind round-headed arcading above billet frieze. Blind rectangular panels in the east gable.  On the north and south sides of chancel are arcade and billet friezes.\n\nInside the chancel, there is, in a recess, a 14th-century wooden effigy and there is a wooden altar table of 1627.\n\n===The Chancel Arch===\nThe most import and impressive feature of the church is the round-headed chancel arch the mid 12th century.  This arch has six elaborately decorated orders on ornamental capitals. The inner order is roll-moulded, the second has beak-heads, the third has zig-zags and continuous crenellation, the fourth various heads including those of a king and queen, figures, animals, a [[green man]] and foliage and the fifth with zig-zags and the sixth an abstract version of beak mouldings. The outermost edge of the arch is decorated with billet moulding.\n\n===The Tower and Porch===\nThe tower has pyramidal roof contains bells which until 1792 hung in a bell-cote at the west end of the chancel. The tower acts as a porch and the round headed entrance has roll-moulded orders and [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] with a tablet to Eliza Wingfield, at whose expense the 1792 restoration was undertaken.\n\n===The Nave and Font===\nThe [[Nave]], which was later medieval, was completely rebuilt in the 1792 restoration. The font which is [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], is slightly later in date than the chancel arch. The font currently is positioned close to the arch, but an eighteenth century plan shows that it was originally closer to the west end on the north side.<ref>''Page'' (1935), pg. 276</ref> The exterior decoration of the nave is a much freer interpretation of the Romanesque style and must be considered one of the earliest examples of [[Romanesque Revival architecture in the United Kingdom|Romanesque Revival architecture]] in the British Isles.\n\n==Burials==\n*[[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Ardglass]] and his wife Elizabeth\n\n==Gallery==\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"4\" style=\"border: 2px solid #9d9d9d;background-color:#eeeeee\" valign=\"midlle\"\n|-\n|\n<div align=\"centre\"><gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Lords and Ladies in Berry - geograph.org.uk - 918155.jpg|East face of the chancel.\nFile:TICKENCOTE CHURCH OF ST PETER FROM THE LYCH GATE.JPG|Tickencote Church from the south.\nFile:Tickencote 14.jpg|Tickencote\nFile:Tickencote 15.jpg|West end of Nave as re-designed by Cockerell in 1792\nFile:Tickencote Church - geograph.org.uk - 63353.jpg|Tickencote Church 1792\nFile:TICKENCOTE ST PETER'S CHURCH Blind arcading part of the restyled 1792 exterior.JPG|Blind arcading part of the restyled 1792 exterior on north side of chancel\nFile:Norman baptismal font, St Peter's parish church, Tickencote - geograph.org.uk - 285878.jpg|Norman font\nFile:Tickencote 6.jpg|Tickencote -Human face and arcading on font..\n</gallery>\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |last1=Pevsner |first1=Nikolaus |author1-link=Nikolaus Pevsner |last2=Williamson |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Brandwood |first3=Geoffrey K |year=1984 |origyear=1960 |title=Leicestershire and Rutland |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |pages=510\u2013512 |ref=harv}}\n*Camden W (ed Richard Gough), (1806) ''Britannia'', 2nd Edition, Vol.2. 329, Pl VII\n*[[Gentleman's Magazine]], (1806), i, pg 34.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category inline|St Peter's Church, Tickencote}}\n*[[Simon Jenkins]] [http://greatenglishchurches.co.uk/html/tickencote.html ''Great English Churches'']\n*Page W.

This is the [[velocity]] at which the phase of any one [[frequency]] component of the wave travels. For such a component, any given phase of the wave (for example, the [[crest (physics)|crest]]) will appear to travel at the phase velocity. The phase velocity is given in terms of the [[wavelength]] {{mvar|\u03bb}} (lambda) and [[Wave period|time period]]  {{mvar|T}} as\n:<math>v_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{\\lambda}{T}.</math>\n\nEquivalently, in terms of the wave's [[angular frequency]]  {{mvar|\u03c9}}, which specifies angular change per unit of time, and [[wavenumber]] (or angular wave number)  {{mvar|k}}, which represents the proportionality between the angular frequency  {{mvar|\u03c9}} and the linear speed (speed of propagation) \u03bd<sub>{{mvar|p}}</sub>,\n:<math>v_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{\\omega}{k}.</math>\n\nTo understand where this equation comes from, consider a basic [[sine wave]],  {{math|''A''&nbsp;cos&nbsp;(''kx''\u2212''\u03c9t'')}}.
