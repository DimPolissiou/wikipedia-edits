[[CN Tower]] near the northern shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. Opened in 1989 on the former [[Railway Lands]], it is home to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). Previously, the stadium was also home to the [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) and the [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) played an annual game at the stadium as part of the [[Bills Toronto Series]] from 2008 to 2013. While it is primarily a sports venue, it also hosts other large events such as [[convention (meeting)|conventions]], [[trade fair]]s, [[concert]]s, [[traveling carnival|travelling carnivals]], and [[monster truck]] shows.\n\nThe stadium was renamed \"Rogers Centre\" following the 2005 purchase of the stadium by [[Rogers Communications]], which also owns the Toronto Blue Jays.<ref name=CBC /><ref name=\"Rogers Purchases SkyDome\">{{cite web |title = Goodbye SkyDome, hello Rogers Centre|url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/goodbye-skydome-hello-rogers-centre-1.549230|website = CBC Sports|date = February 2, 2005|accessdate = May 28, 2015}}</ref> The venue was noted for being the first stadium to have a [[retractable roof|fully retractable motorized roof]], as well as for the 348-room hotel attached to it with 70 rooms overlooking the field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1131117-2012-mlb-season-power-ranking-the-30-stadiums#articles/1131117-2012-mlb-season-power-ranking-the-30-stadiums/page/21|title=Power Ranking All 30 MLB Stadiums|author=John  Ewen|website=Bleacher Report}}</ref> It is also the last North American major-league stadium built to accommodate both [[Canadian football|football]] and [[baseball]]. The stadium served as the site of both the [[2015 Pan American Games opening ceremony|opening]] and [[2015 Pan American Games closing ceremony|closing ceremonies]] of the [[2015 Pan American Games]] (renamed the '''Pan-Am Dome''' or '''Pan-Am Ceremonies Venue''' due to sponsorship regulations).<ref>{{cite web|title=Rogers Centre Among Venues Proposed for 2015 Pan Am Games|url=http://www.bizbash.com/toronto/content/editorial/14569_rogers_centre_ontario_place_among_venues_proposed_for_2015_pan_am_games.php|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731003215/http://www.bizbash.com/toronto/content/editorial/14569_rogers_centre_ontario_place_among_venues_proposed_for_2015_pan_am_games.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 31, 2012|website=Biz Bash Toronto|date=November 7, 2009|accessdate=November 7, 2009|quote=Rogers Centre, Ontario Place Among Venues Proposed for 2015 Pan Am Games}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe stadium was designed by architect [[Rod Robbie]] and structural engineer Michael Allen and was constructed by the [[EllisDon]] Construction company of [[London, Ontario]] and the [[Dominion Bridge Company]] of Lachine, Quebec. The stadium's construction lasted about two and a half years, from October 1986 to May 1989. The approximate cost of construction was [[Canadian dollar|C$]]570&nbsp;million<ref name=cbcwinlose /> (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|570000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) which was paid for by the [[Government of Canada|federal government]], [[Ontario]] [[Government of Ontario|provincial government]], the City of Toronto, and a large [[consortium]] of corporations.<ref>Romell, Rick. \"Tax money for stadium site backed\". Milwaukee Sentinel May 16, 1989: 1\u20136.</ref>\n[[File:Rogers Center-restitched.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[CN Tower]] viewed from the Rogers Centre]]\n\n=== Background ===\nThe main impetus for building an enclosed sports venue in Toronto came following the [[70th Grey Cup|Grey Cup]] game in November 1982, held at the outdoor [[Exhibition Stadium]]. The game (in which the hometown [[Toronto Argonauts]] were making their first Grey Cup appearance since [[59th Grey Cup|1971]]) was played in a driving rainstorm that left most of the crowd drenched, leading the media to call it \"the Rain Bowl\". As many of the seats were completely exposed to the elements, thousands watched the game from the concession section. To make a bad experience even worse, the washrooms overflowed. In attendance that day was [[Bill Davis]], the [[Premier of Ontario]], and the poor conditions were seen by the largest TV audience in Canada (over 7.862 million viewers) to that point.<ref>[https://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=33 Canadian Football League] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016233646/http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=33 |date=October 16, 2015 }}, Canada.</ref> The following day, at a rally for the Argos at [[Toronto City Hall]], tens of thousands of people who attended the game began to chant, \"We want a [[dome]]! We want a dome!\"<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=K1JsDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT785&lpg=PT785&dq=toronto+rally+1982+we+want+a+dome#v=onepage&q=toronto%20rally%201982%20we%20want%20a%20dome&f=false | title=Paikin on Ontario's Premiers 2-Book Bundle: Bill Davis / Paikin and the Premiers| isbn=9781459738331| last1=Paikin| first1=Steve| date=2016-10-22}}</ref>\n\nSeven months later, in June 1983, Davis formally announced a three-person committee would look into the feasibility of building a domed stadium at [[Exhibition Place]]. The committee consisted of [[Paul Godfrey]], [[Larry Grossman (politician)|Larry Grossman]] and former Ontario Hydro chairman Hugh Macaulay.<ref>Miller, David (October 7, 1984). Battle Is On for Right to Build Our Domed Stadium. [[Toronto Star]]. pg A1, A13.</ref>\n\nThe committee examined various projects, including a large indoor stadium at Exhibition Place with an air-supported dome, similar to [[BC Place]] in Vancouver. In 1985, an international design competition was launched to design a new stadium, along with selection of a site. Some of the proposed sites included Exhibition Place, [[Downsview Airport]], and [[York University]]. The final site was at the base of the [[CN Tower]] not far from [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]], a major railway and transit hub. The [[Railway Lands]] were a major [[Canadian National Railway]] rail switching yard encompassing the [[CNR Spadina Roundhouse]] (the desolate downtown lands were part of a master plan for revitalizing the area, which includes [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]]). Ultimately, the Robbie/Allen concept won because it provided the largest roof opening of all the finalists, and it was the most technically sound.\n\n=== Naming ===\nThe name \"SkyDome\" was chosen as part of a province-wide \"name the stadium\" contest in 1987. Sponsored by the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', ballots were offered for people to submit their suggested name, with lifetime seats behind home plate to all events at the stadium (including concerts) as the prize. Over 150,000 entries were received with 12,897 different names. The selection committee narrowed it down to four choices: \"Towerdome\", \"Harbourdome\", \"SkyDome\", and simply \"the Dome\". The judges' final selection was SkyDome. Premier [[David Peterson]] drew the prize-winning entry of Kellie Watson from a lottery barrel containing the over-2,000 entries that proposed \"SkyDome\". At the press conference announcing the name, Chuck Magwood, president of the Stadium Corporation of Ontario (Stadco), the crown corporation created to run SkyDome,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/416338/article-1G1-30127808/skydome-then-and-now |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309210650/https://business.highbeam.com/416338/article-1G1-30127808/skydome-then-and-now |archivedate=March 9, 2016 |df=mdy }}</ref> commented: \"The sky is a huge part of the whole roof process. The name has a sense of the infinite and that's what this is all about.\" Kellie Watson received lifetime seating of choice at SkyDome, which is still honoured after the stadium renamed to Rogers Centre.\n\n=== Financing ===\nThe stadium was funded by a public/private partnership, with the government paying the largest percentage of the tab. The initial cost of $150&nbsp;million was greatly underestimated,<ref name=deMause>{{cite web|url=http://demause.net/skydome.html|title=DOME TO NOWHERE|author=[[Neil deMause]]}}</ref> with the final tab coming in at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]570&nbsp;million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|570000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}).<ref name=cbcwinlose /> Two levels of government ([[Metropolitan Toronto|Metro Toronto]] and Provincial) each initially contributed $30&nbsp;million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|30000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}).<ref name=cbcwinlose /><ref name=deMause /><ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/tor/ballpark/reference/index.jsp?content=history|title=ROGERS CENTRE HISTORY|accessdate=December 28, 2013|publisher=[[Toronto Blue Jays]]}}</ref> This does not include the actual value of the land the stadium sits on (as it was part of a deal with the Crown agency&nbsp;\u2013 CN Rail). [[Beer in Canada|Canada's three main breweries]] ([[Labatt Brewing Company|Labatt's]], [[Molson]], and [[Carling O'Keefe]]) and the Toronto Blue Jays each paid $5&nbsp;million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|5000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) to help fund the stadium.<ref name=history /> An additional 26 other Canadian corporations (selected by invitation only) also contributed $5&nbsp;million,<ref name=history /> for which they received one of the 161 Skyboxes with four parking spaces (for ten years, with an opportunity for renewal) and a 99-year exclusive option on stadium advertising. Skyboxes initially leased for $150,000 up to $225,000 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|150000|1989}}}} to ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|225000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) a year in 1989&nbsp;\u2013 plus the cost of tickets for all events.\n\nThe then unusual financing structure created controversy. First of all, there was no public tender for supplies and equipment. Secondly, companies that paid the $5&nbsp;million fee, such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]], received 100% stadium exclusivity,<ref name=cbcwinlose /> including advertising rights, for the life of their contract that could be extended up to 99&nbsp;years. Third, the contracts were not put up for bid, meaning there was some doubt the contracts were made at a market rate: [[Pepsi]] stated at the time that had they known the terms of the contract they would have paid far more than $5&nbsp;million for the rights. Local media like [[Now (newspaper)|''NOW Magazine'']] called the amount charged to the companies \"scandalously low\".<ref>[[Now (newspaper)|''NOW Magazine'']], December 3\u20139, 1998.</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\n\n[[File:Suspension bridge over railway tracks SkyDomeRogersCentre.JPG|thumb|right|A [[cable-stayed bridge]] was built over the [[Union Station Rail Corridor]] next to the stadium.]]\n\nConstruction was done by lead contractor EllisDon. Several factors complicated the construction: The lands housed a functioning water pumping station that needed to be relocated, the soil was contaminated from a century of industrial use, railway buildings needed to be torn down or moved, and the site was rich with archaeological finds. One of the most complex issues was moving the John Street pumping station across the street to its new home south of the stadium. Foundations to the stadium were being poured even as the facility (in the infield area) continued to function, as construction on its new location had yet to be completed.\n\nBecause the stadium was the first of its kind in the world, the architects and engineers kept the design simple (by using a sturdy dome shape) and used proven technologies to move the roof. It was important the design would work and be reliable as to avoid the various problems that plagued Montreal's [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]]. The 31-storey high roof consists of four panels; one (on the north end) is fixed in place and the other three are moved by electrically driven 'train' engines, that run on high strength railway rails. The roof, which takes 20 minutes to open, was made out of steel trusses covered by corrugated steel cladding, which in turn is covered by a single-ply PVC membrane.\n\nBecause of its location south of the major railway corridor, new pedestrian connections had to be built; the infrastructure was part of the reason for the high cost of the stadium. The [[SkyWalk]] is an approximately {{convert|500|m|adj=on}} enclosed walkway that leads from the base of the CN Tower and via a bridge connects to Union Station (and is part of the [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] network). The John Street [[cable-stayed bridge]] was built to provide north\u2013south passage over the rail tracks, linking Front Street with the stadium.\n\nConstruction at the site, which at one time was south of the shoreline, unearthed over 1,500 artifacts. These included a 200-year-old French cannon used as ballast for a ship, cannonballs, pottery and a telescope.<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Toronto's waterfront: Dredging up the past to build the future |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/08/06/torontos_waterfront_dredging_up_the_past_to_build_the_future.html |date=August 6, 2013 |first=Tim |last=Alamenciak |accessdate=March 7, 2019}}</ref> The stadium was completed two months late, having been planned to open for the first regular season Toronto Blue Jays game in 1989; the team played the first two months of their home schedule at Exhibition Stadium that year.\n\n=== Opening ===\n[[File:The audience.JPG|thumb|right|''The Audience'' by [[Michael Snow]] on the northwest corner fa\u00e7ade]]\n\nThe stadium officially opened on June 3, 1989, and hosted an official grand opening show: \"The Opening of SkyDome: A Celebration\", broadcast on CBC television the following evening hosted by [[Brian Williams (sportscaster)|Brian Williams]]. With a crowd of over 50,000 in attendance, the event included appearances by [[Alan Thicke]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Andrea Martin]] of [[Second City Television|''SCTV'']], impersonator [[Andr\u00e9-Philippe Gagnon]] and rock band [[Glass Tiger]]. The roof was ceremonially \"opened\" by Ontario Premier [[David Peterson]] with a laser pen. The roof's opening exposed the crowd to a downpour of rain. Despite audible chants of \"close the roof\", Magwood insisted the roof remain fully open.\n\n=== Financial problems and fallout ===\n[[File:SkyDomeLogo.png|thumb|right|SkyDome logo (1989\u20132005)]]\n\nThe stadium became a thorn in the side of [[David Peterson]]'s [[Ontario Liberal Party|Ontario Liberal]] government for repeated cost overruns. After the [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberals]] were defeated by the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|NDP]] in the [[1990 Ontario general election|1990 Ontario election]], a review by the new [[Bob Rae]] government in October 1990 revealed Stadco's debt meant the Dome would have to be booked 600&nbsp;days a year to turn a profit, almost twice as many days as there are days in a calendar year. The stadium income was only $17&nbsp;million in its first year of operations, while debt service was $40&nbsp;million. It was determined the abrupt late inclusion by Stadco of a hotel and health club added an additional $112&nbsp;million to the cost of the building.\n\nAs the province slipped into [[Early 1990s recession|a recession]], Rae appointed [[University of Toronto]] professor [[Bruce Kidd]] and [[Canadian Auto Workers]] President [[Bob White (trade unionist)|Bob White]] to the Stadco board to help deal with the stadium's growing debt, but the original $165&nbsp;million debt had ballooned to $400&nbsp;million by 1993.<ref name=cbcwinlose /><ref name=deMause /> Stadco became a political liability, and in March 1994, the Ontario government paid off all outstanding Stadco debts from the government treasury and sold the stadium for $151&nbsp;million to a private consortium that included Labatt Breweries, the Blue Jays' owner.<ref name=deMause /><ref name=rogersbuy />\n\nIn November 1998, the stadium, which Labatt then owned as 49% of total, filed for bankruptcy protection,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/skydome-seeks-bankruptcy-protection-1.161002|title=SkyDome seeks bankruptcy protection|date=November 26, 1998|accessdate=December 28, 2013|publisher=[[CBC News]]}}</ref> triggered after disastrous Skybox renewal numbers. Most of the 161 Skybox tenants had signed on for 10-year leases; a marked decrease in interest in the stadium's teams and the construction of the [[Scotiabank Arena|Air Canada Centre]], which hosted the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Toronto Raptors]], resulted in few renewals for Skybox leases. That same month, the Blue Jays re-signed for an additional ten years in the facility.<ref name=deMause />\n\nIn April 1999, Sportsco International LP bought the stadium out of bankruptcy protection for $80&nbsp;million.<ref name=rogersbuy>{{cite web |url=https://www.tsn.ca/story/print/?id=106352 |title=Rogers buys SkyDome for $25 million |date=November 29, 2004 |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |work=[[The Sports Network]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228090352/https://www.tsn.ca/story/print/?id=106352 |archive-date=December 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Purchase and renaming ===\n<!-- Do not replace with commons equivalent, since it is in fact the Detroit waterfront -->\n[[File:Rogers Centre.

The [[1991 American League Championship Series]] was the first Major League Baseball playoff series played entirely indoors with the first two games at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]] in Minneapolis and the final three at SkyDome.\n\nGames in the first round of the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]] were played at the Rogers Centre.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rogers Centre to host WBC games in '09|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/2008/07/31/wbc_toronto_groupgames|website=[[Sportsnet]]|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBesides baseball, Rogers Centre was the original home of the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Toronto Raptors]], who played at the venue from November 1995 to February 1999, while the Air Canada Centre (later renamed [[Scotiabank Arena]]) was being planned and built. It proved to be somewhat problematic as a basketball venue, even considering it was only a temporary facility. For instance, many seats that were theoretically in line with the court were so far away fans needed binoculars to see the action. Other seats were so badly obstructed that fans sitting there could only watch the game on the replay boards. For most games, Rogers Centre seated 22,900 people. However, the Raptors sometimes opened the 500 Level, which is the stadium's uppermost level, when popular opponents came to town, such as the [[Chicago Bulls]] when [[Michael Jordan]] was a member of the team, expanding capacity to 29,000 and held over 36,000 attendees at one point.\n\n=== Football ===\n[[File:Toronto Argonauts vs. Hamilton Tiger-Cats at Rogers Centre, October 27 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Toronto Argonauts]] vs. [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]], October 27, 2005]]\n\nRogers Centre hosted Canadian football from opening in 1989 to 2015, as the Argonauts moved to [[BMO Field]] in 2016. In November 2007, it hosted the [[95th Grey Cup]], its first since 1992 and third all-time. It was the 56th Grey Cup hosted by the city of Toronto since the championship's inception in 1909.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2003, SkyDome hosted the [[Vanier Cup]] championship of Canadian Interuniversity Sport (later renamed [[U Sports]] in 2016) football.\n\nIn 1994, then-part owner of SkyDome Labatt considered purchasing a [[National Football League]] and a [[Major League Soccer]] team to play at the stadium.<ref name=dreamjob>{{cite book|title=Dream Job|last=Peddie|first=Richard|year=2013|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2007, Rogers Centre played host to the first [[International Bowl]], an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college football]] game between the Western Michigan University Broncos and the University of Cincinnati Bearcats. In 2008, Rutgers played Ball State in the second International Bowl. The [[Buffalo Bulls football|University at Buffalo Bulls]] and the [[UConn Huskies football|University of Connecticut Huskies]] played in the third International Bowl on January 3, 2009.\n\nRogers Centre was also the venue for the [[43rd Vanier Cup]] on Friday November 23, just two days before Grey Cup Sunday. It was the 16th Vanier Cup hosted at the venue, returning after a three-year absence in which it was hosted by [[Hamilton, Ontario]] (2004 and 2005) and [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan (2006). It was the 40th Vanier Cup hosted by Toronto since that championship's inception in 1965.\n\n{{see also|National Football League in Toronto}}\n\nThe [[National Football League]]'s [[Buffalo Bills]] announced its intentions to play five \"home\" games (and three pre-season games) in Rogers Centre in October 2007, so beginning the [[Bills Toronto Series]]; the first of these regular-season games took place on December 7 of the [[2008 NFL season]] versus the [[Miami Dolphins]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Bills Have Deal in Place for Toronto Games|first1=Mark|last1=Gaughan|first2=Jerry|last2=Sullivan|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/258/story/264441.html|newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=January 30, 2008|accessdate=January 30, 2008}}</ref> It marked the first time an NFL team has established a \"home\" stadium outside the United States for regular-season games.

[[CN Tower]] near the northern shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. Opened in 1989 on the former [[Railway Lands]], it is home to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). Previously, the stadium was also home to the [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) and the [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) played an annual game at the stadium as part of the [[Bills Toronto Series]] from 2008 to 2013. While it is primarily a sports venue, it also hosts other large events such as [[convention (meeting)|conventions]], [[trade fair]]s, [[concert]]s, [[traveling carnival|travelling carnivals]], and [[monster truck]] shows.\n\nThe stadium was renamed \"Rogers Centre\" following the 2005 purchase of the stadium by [[Rogers Communications]], which also owns the Toronto Blue Jays.<ref name=CBC /><ref name=\"Rogers Purchases SkyDome\">{{cite web |title = Goodbye SkyDome, hello Rogers Centre|url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/goodbye-skydome-hello-rogers-centre-1.549230|website = CBC Sports|date = February 2, 2005|accessdate = May 28, 2015}}</ref> The venue was noted for being the first stadium to have a [[retractable roof|fully retractable motorized roof]], as well as for the 348-room hotel attached to it with 70 rooms overlooking the field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1131117-2012-mlb-season-power-ranking-the-30-stadiums#articles/1131117-2012-mlb-season-power-ranking-the-30-stadiums/page/21|title=Power Ranking All 30 MLB Stadiums|author=John  Ewen|website=Bleacher Report}}</ref> It is also the last North American major-league stadium built to accommodate both [[Canadian football|football]] and [[baseball]].

The stadium's construction lasted about two and a half years, from October 1986 to May 1989. The approximate cost of construction was [[Canadian dollar|C$]]570&nbsp;million<ref name=cbcwinlose /> (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|570000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) which was paid for by the [[Government of Canada|federal government]], [[Ontario]] [[Government of Ontario|provincial government]], the City of Toronto, and a large [[consortium]] of corporations.<ref>Romell, Rick. \"Tax money for stadium site backed\". Milwaukee Sentinel May 16, 1989: 1\u20136.</ref>\n[[File:Rogers Center-restitched.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[CN Tower]] viewed from the Rogers Centre]]\n\n=== Background ===\nThe main impetus for building an enclosed sports venue in Toronto came following the [[70th Grey Cup|Grey Cup]] game in November 1982, held at the outdoor [[Exhibition Stadium]]. The game (in which the hometown [[Toronto Argonauts]] were making their first Grey Cup appearance since [[59th Grey Cup|1971]]) was played in a driving rainstorm that left most of the crowd drenched, leading the media to call it \"the Rain Bowl\". As many of the seats were completely exposed to the elements, thousands watched the game from the concession section. To make a bad experience even worse, the washrooms overflowed. In attendance that day was [[Bill Davis]], the [[Premier of Ontario]], and the poor conditions were seen by the largest TV audience in Canada (over 7.862 million viewers) to that point.<ref>[https://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=33 Canadian Football League] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016233646/http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=33 |date=October 16, 2015 }}, Canada.</ref> The following day, at a rally for the Argos at [[Toronto City Hall]], tens of thousands of people who attended the game began to chant, \"We want a [[dome]]! We want a dome!\"<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=K1JsDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT785&lpg=PT785&dq=toronto+rally+1982+we+want+a+dome#v=onepage&q=toronto%20rally%201982%20we%20want%20a%20dome&f=false | title=Paikin on Ontario's Premiers 2-Book Bundle: Bill Davis / Paikin and the Premiers| isbn=9781459738331| last1=Paikin| first1=Steve| date=2016-10-22}}</ref>\n\nSeven months later, in June 1983, Davis formally announced a three-person committee would look into the feasibility of building a domed stadium at [[Exhibition Place]]. The committee consisted of [[Paul Godfrey]], [[Larry Grossman (politician)|Larry Grossman]] and former Ontario Hydro chairman Hugh Macaulay.<ref>Miller, David (October 7, 1984). Battle Is On for Right to Build Our Domed Stadium. [[Toronto Star]]. pg A1, A13.</ref>\n\nThe committee examined various projects, including a large indoor stadium at Exhibition Place with an air-supported dome, similar to [[BC Place]] in Vancouver. In 1985, an international design competition was launched to design a new stadium, along with selection of a site. Some of the proposed sites included Exhibition Place, [[Downsview Airport]], and [[York University]]. The final site was at the base of the [[CN Tower]] not far from [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]], a major railway and transit hub. The [[Railway Lands]] were a major [[Canadian National Railway]] rail switching yard encompassing the [[CNR Spadina Roundhouse]] (the desolate downtown lands were part of a master plan for revitalizing the area, which includes [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]]). Ultimately, the Robbie/Allen concept won because it provided the largest roof opening of all the finalists, and it was the most technically sound.\n\n=== Naming ===\nThe name \"SkyDome\" was chosen as part of a province-wide \"name the stadium\" contest in 1987. Sponsored by the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', ballots were offered for people to submit their suggested name, with lifetime seats behind home plate to all events at the stadium (including concerts) as the prize. Over 150,000 entries were received with 12,897 different names. The selection committee narrowed it down to four choices: \"Towerdome\", \"Harbourdome\", \"SkyDome\", and simply \"the Dome\". The judges' final selection was SkyDome. Premier [[David Peterson]] drew the prize-winning entry of Kellie Watson from a lottery barrel containing the over-2,000 entries that proposed \"SkyDome\". At the press conference announcing the name, Chuck Magwood, president of the Stadium Corporation of Ontario (Stadco), the crown corporation created to run SkyDome,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/416338/article-1G1-30127808/skydome-then-and-now |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309210650/https://business.highbeam.com/416338/article-1G1-30127808/skydome-then-and-now |archivedate=March 9, 2016 |df=mdy }}</ref> commented: \"The sky is a huge part of the whole roof process. The name has a sense of the infinite and that's what this is all about.\" Kellie Watson received lifetime seating of choice at SkyDome, which is still honoured after the stadium renamed to Rogers Centre.\n\n=== Financing ===\nThe stadium was funded by a public/private partnership, with the government paying the largest percentage of the tab. The initial cost of $150&nbsp;million was greatly underestimated,<ref name=deMause>{{cite web|url=http://demause.net/skydome.html|title=DOME TO NOWHERE|author=[[Neil deMause]]}}</ref> with the final tab coming in at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]570&nbsp;million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|570000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}).<ref name=cbcwinlose /> Two levels of government ([[Metropolitan Toronto|Metro Toronto]] and Provincial) each initially contributed $30&nbsp;million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|30000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}).<ref name=cbcwinlose /><ref name=deMause /><ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/tor/ballpark/reference/index.jsp?content=history|title=ROGERS CENTRE HISTORY|accessdate=December 28, 2013|publisher=[[Toronto Blue Jays]]}}</ref> This does not include the actual value of the land the stadium sits on (as it was part of a deal with the Crown agency&nbsp;\u2013 CN Rail). [[Beer in Canada|Canada's three main breweries]] ([[Labatt Brewing Company|Labatt's]], [[Molson]], and [[Carling O'Keefe]]) and the Toronto Blue Jays each paid $5&nbsp;million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|5000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) to help fund the stadium.<ref name=history /> An additional 26 other Canadian corporations (selected by invitation only) also contributed $5&nbsp;million,<ref name=history /> for which they received one of the 161 Skyboxes with four parking spaces (for ten years, with an opportunity for renewal) and a 99-year exclusive option on stadium advertising. Skyboxes initially leased for $150,000 up to $225,000 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|150000|1989}}}} to ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|225000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars{{inflation-fn|CA}}) a year in 1989&nbsp;\u2013 plus the cost of tickets for all events.\n\nThe then unusual financing structure created controversy. First of all, there was no public tender for supplies and equipment. Secondly, companies that paid the $5&nbsp;million fee, such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]], received 100% stadium exclusivity,<ref name=cbcwinlose /> including advertising rights, for the life of their contract that could be extended up to 99&nbsp;years. Third, the contracts were not put up for bid, meaning there was some doubt the contracts were made at a market rate: [[Pepsi]] stated at the time that had they known the terms of the contract they would have paid far more than $5&nbsp;million for the rights. Local media like [[Now (newspaper)|''NOW Magazine'']] called the amount charged to the companies \"scandalously low\".<ref>[[Now (newspaper)|''NOW Magazine'']], December 3\u20139, 1998.</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\n\n[[File:Suspension bridge over railway tracks SkyDomeRogersCentre.JPG|thumb|right|A [[cable-stayed bridge]] was built over the [[Union Station Rail Corridor]] next to the stadium.]]\n\nConstruction was done by lead contractor EllisDon. Several factors complicated the construction: The lands housed a functioning water pumping station that needed to be relocated, the soil was contaminated from a century of industrial use, railway buildings needed to be torn down or moved, and the site was rich with archaeological finds. One of the most complex issues was moving the John Street pumping station across the street to its new home south of the stadium. Foundations to the stadium were being poured even as the facility (in the infield area) continued to function, as construction on its new location had yet to be completed.\n\nBecause the stadium was the first of its kind in the world, the architects and engineers kept the design simple (by using a sturdy dome shape) and used proven technologies to move the roof. It was important the design would work and be reliable as to avoid the various problems that plagued Montreal's [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]]. The 31-storey high roof consists of four panels; one (on the north end) is fixed in place and the other three are moved by electrically driven 'train' engines, that run on high strength railway rails. The roof, which takes 20 minutes to open, was made out of steel trusses covered by corrugated steel cladding, which in turn is covered by a single-ply PVC membrane.\n\nBecause of its location south of the major railway corridor, new pedestrian connections had to be built; the infrastructure was part of the reason for the high cost of the stadium. The [[SkyWalk]] is an approximately {{convert|500|m|adj=on}} enclosed walkway that leads from the base of the CN Tower and via a bridge connects to Union Station (and is part of the [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] network). The John Street [[cable-stayed bridge]] was built to provide north\u2013south passage over the rail tracks, linking Front Street with the stadium.\n\nConstruction at the site, which at one time was south of the shoreline, unearthed over 1,500 artifacts.

The roof was ceremonially \"opened\" by Ontario Premier [[David Peterson]] with a laser pen. The roof's opening exposed the crowd to a downpour of rain. Despite audible chants of \"close the roof\", Magwood insisted the roof remain fully open.\n\n=== Financial problems and fallout ===\n[[File:SkyDomeLogo.png|thumb|right|SkyDome logo (1989\u20132005)]]\n\nThe stadium became a thorn in the side of [[David Peterson]]'s [[Ontario Liberal Party|Ontario Liberal]] government for repeated cost overruns. After the [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberals]] were defeated by the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|NDP]] in the [[1990 Ontario general election|1990 Ontario election]], a review by the new [[Bob Rae]] government in October 1990 revealed Stadco's debt meant the Dome would have to be booked 600&nbsp;days a year to turn a profit, almost twice as many days as there are days in a calendar year. The stadium income was only $17&nbsp;million in its first year of operations, while debt service was $40&nbsp;million. It was determined the abrupt late inclusion by Stadco of a hotel and health club added an additional $112&nbsp;million to the cost of the building.\n\nAs the province slipped into [[Early 1990s recession|a recession]], Rae appointed [[University of Toronto]] professor [[Bruce Kidd]] and [[Canadian Auto Workers]] President [[Bob White (trade unionist)|Bob White]] to the Stadco board to help deal with the stadium's growing debt, but the original $165&nbsp;million debt had ballooned to $400&nbsp;million by 1993.<ref name=cbcwinlose /><ref name=deMause /> Stadco became a political liability, and in March 1994, the Ontario government paid off all outstanding Stadco debts from the government treasury and sold the stadium for $151&nbsp;million to a private consortium that included Labatt Breweries, the Blue Jays' owner.<ref name=deMause /><ref name=rogersbuy />\n\nIn November 1998, the stadium, which Labatt then owned as 49% of total, filed for bankruptcy protection,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/skydome-seeks-bankruptcy-protection-1.161002|title=SkyDome seeks bankruptcy protection|date=November 26, 1998|accessdate=December 28, 2013|publisher=[[CBC News]]}}</ref> triggered after disastrous Skybox renewal numbers.

The stadium also hosted the [[1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. The [[1991 American League Championship Series]] was the first Major League Baseball playoff series played entirely indoors with the first two games at the [[Hubert H.

It proved to be somewhat problematic as a basketball venue, even considering it was only a temporary facility. For instance, many seats that were theoretically in line with the court were so far away fans needed binoculars to see the action. Other seats were so badly obstructed that fans sitting there could only watch the game on the replay boards. For most games, Rogers Centre seated 22,900 people. However, the Raptors sometimes opened the 500 Level, which is the stadium's uppermost level, when popular opponents came to town, such as the [[Chicago Bulls]] when [[Michael Jordan]] was a member of the team, expanding capacity to 29,000 and held over 36,000 attendees at one point.\n\n=== Football ===\n[[File:Toronto Argonauts vs. Hamilton Tiger-Cats at Rogers Centre, October 27 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Toronto Argonauts]] vs. [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]], October 27, 2005]]\n\nRogers Centre hosted Canadian football from opening in 1989 to 2015, as the Argonauts moved to [[BMO Field]] in 2016. In November 2007, it hosted the [[95th Grey Cup]], its first since 1992 and third all-time. It was the 56th Grey Cup hosted by the city of Toronto since the championship's inception in 1909.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2003, SkyDome hosted the [[Vanier Cup]] championship of Canadian Interuniversity Sport (later renamed [[U Sports]] in 2016) football.\n\nIn 1994, then-part owner of SkyDome Labatt considered purchasing a [[National Football League]] and a [[Major League Soccer]] team to play at the stadium.<ref name=dreamjob>{{cite book|title=Dream Job|last=Peddie|first=Richard|year=2013|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2007, Rogers Centre played host to the first [[International Bowl]], an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college football]] game between the Western Michigan University Broncos and the University of Cincinnati Bearcats. In 2008, Rutgers played Ball State in the second International Bowl. The [[Buffalo Bulls football|University at Buffalo Bulls]] and the [[UConn Huskies football|University of Connecticut Huskies]] played in the third International Bowl on January 3, 2009.\n\nRogers Centre was also the venue for the [[43rd Vanier Cup]] on Friday November 23, just two days before Grey Cup Sunday. It was the 16th Vanier Cup hosted at the venue, returning after a three-year absence in which it was hosted by [[Hamilton, Ontario]] (2004 and 2005) and [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan (2006). It was the 40th Vanier Cup hosted by Toronto since that championship's inception in 1965.\n\n{{see also|National Football League in Toronto}}\n\nThe [[National Football League]]'s [[Buffalo Bills]] announced its intentions to play five \"home\" games (and three pre-season games) in Rogers Centre in October 2007, so beginning the [[Bills Toronto Series]]; the first of these regular-season games took place on December 7 of the [[2008 NFL season]] versus the [[Miami Dolphins]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Bills Have Deal in Place for Toronto Games|first1=Mark|last1=Gaughan|first2=Jerry|last2=Sullivan|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/258/story/264441.html|newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=January 30, 2008|accessdate=January 30, 2008}}</ref> It marked the first time an NFL team has established a \"home\" stadium outside the United States for regular-season games.

The book's sequel, ''The Lost World'', was also adapted by Spielberg into a [[The Lost World: Jurassic Park|film]] in 1997. A [[Jurassic Park III|third film]], directed by [[Joe Johnston]] and released in 2001, drew several elements, themes, and scenes from both books that were ultimately not utilized in either of the previous films, such as the aviary and boat scenes.\n\nThe novel began as a [[screenplay]] Crichton wrote in 1983, about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur.<ref>{{Cite AV media | people = Crichton, Michael | title = Michael Crichton on the Jurassic Park Phenomenon | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal | date = 2001}}</ref> Eventually, given his reasoning that genetic research is expensive and \"there is no pressing need to create a dinosaur\", Crichton concluded that it would emerge from a \"desire to entertain\", leading to a [[Wildlife refuge|wildlife park]] of extinct animals.<ref>\"Return to Jurassic Park: Dawn of a New Era\", ''Jurassic Park'' Blu-ray (2011)</ref> Originally, the story was told from the point of view of a child, but Crichton changed it as everyone who read the draft felt it would be better if told by an adult.<ref>[http://www.michaelcrichton.net/books-jurassicpark-mcnotes.html Michael Crichton's notes on Jurassic Park]</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn 1989, a series of strange animal attacks occur in [[Costa Rica]] and on the nearby fictional island of [[Isla Nublar]],<ref>Means approximately \"Clouded Island\" or \"Obscured Island\" in Spanish.</ref> the story's main setting, one of which is a worker severely injured on a construction project on Isla Nublar, whose employers refuse to disclose any information about. One of the species is eventually identified as a ''[[Procompsognathus]]''. [[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Alan Grant|Alan Grant]] and his [[Paleobotany|paleobotanist]] graduate student, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Ellen Sattler|Ellie Sattler]], are contacted to confirm the identification, but are abruptly whisked away by billionaire [[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Hammond|John Hammond]]&nbsp;\u2014 founder and chief executive officer of International Genetic Technologies, or InGen&nbsp;\u2014 for a weekend visit to a \"biological preserve\" he has established on Isla Nublar.\n\nUpon arrival, the preserve is revealed to be Jurassic Park, a [[Amusement park|theme park]] showcasing [[Cloning#Artificial cloning of organisms|cloned]] dinosaurs. The animals have been recreated using [[Ancient DNA|damaged dinosaur DNA]] found in blood inside of gnats, ticks, and mosquitoes fossilized and preserved in [[amber]]. Gaps in the genetic code have been filled in with \"compatible\" [[Reptile|reptilian]], [[Bird|avian]] or [[amphibian]] [[DNA]]. To control the population, all specimens on the island are [[lysine]]-[[Auxotrophy|deficient]] and X-Ray sterilized females. Hammond proudly touts InGen's advances in [[genetic engineering]] and shows his guests through the island's vast array of automated systems.\n\n[[File:Curva del drag\u00f3n.png|thumb|left|Ian Malcolm created [[dragon curve]]s to simulate the actions that were to take place in the park.]]\n\nRecent incidents in the park have spooked Hammond's investors. To placate them, Hammond uses Grant and Sattler as fresh consultants. They stand in counterbalance to a famous mathematician and [[Chaos theory|chaos theorist]], [[Ian Malcolm (character)|Ian Malcolm]], and a lawyer representing the investors, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Donald Gennaro|Donald Gennaro]], who are pessimistic about the park's prospects. Malcolm, having been consulted before the park's creation, is especially emphatic in his prediction that the park will collapse, as it is an unsustainable simple structure bluntly forced upon a [[complex system]] with too many unpredictable variables, such as an uncontrollable population, attempting to contain animals with no real equivalent to extant animals with no predictable behavior patterns, and an untested computer system that continually fails to monitor and feed the population.\n\nCountering Malcolm's dire predictions with youthful energy, Hammond groups the consultants with his grandchildren, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Timothy Murphy|Tim]] and [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Alexis Murphy|Alexis \"Lex\" Murphy]]. While touring the park, Grant finds a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' eggshell, seemingly proving Malcolm's earlier assertion that the dinosaurs have somehow been breeding against the geneticists' design.\n\nMeanwhile, the disgruntled chief programmer of Jurassic Park's controlling software, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dennis Nedry|Dennis Nedry]], attempts [[Industrial espionage|corporate espionage]] for [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Lewis Dodgson|Lewis Dodgson]], a geneticist and agent of InGen's archrival, Biosyn. By activating a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] he wrote into the park's computer system, Nedry shuts down its security systems and steals frozen embryos for each of the park's fifteen species in an attempt to smuggle them to a contact waiting at an auxiliary dock at the eastern end of the park. However, during a sudden [[Tropical cyclone#Tropical storm|tropical storm]], he exits his vehicle to get his bearings and is killed by a ''[[Dilophosaurus]]''. Without Nedry to reactivate the park's security, the electrified fences remain off and all the dinosaurs escape.

A [[Jurassic Park III|third film]], directed by [[Joe Johnston]] and released in 2001, drew several elements, themes, and scenes from both books that were ultimately not utilized in either of the previous films, such as the aviary and boat scenes.\n\nThe novel began as a [[screenplay]] Crichton wrote in 1983, about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur.<ref>{{Cite AV media | people = Crichton, Michael | title = Michael Crichton on the Jurassic Park Phenomenon | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal | date = 2001}}</ref> Eventually, given his reasoning that genetic research is expensive and \"there is no pressing need to create a dinosaur\", Crichton concluded that it would emerge from a \"desire to entertain\", leading to a [[Wildlife refuge|wildlife park]] of extinct animals.<ref>\"Return to Jurassic Park: Dawn of a New Era\", ''Jurassic Park'' Blu-ray (2011)</ref> Originally, the story was told from the point of view of a child, but Crichton changed it as everyone who read the draft felt it would be better if told by an adult.<ref>[http://www.michaelcrichton.net/books-jurassicpark-mcnotes.html Michael Crichton's notes on Jurassic Park]</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn 1989, a series of strange animal attacks occur in [[Costa Rica]] and on the nearby fictional island of [[Isla Nublar]],<ref>Means approximately \"Clouded Island\" or \"Obscured Island\" in Spanish.</ref> the story's main setting, one of which is a worker severely injured on a construction project on Isla Nublar, whose employers refuse to disclose any information about. One of the species is eventually identified as a ''[[Procompsognathus]]''. [[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Alan Grant|Alan Grant]] and his [[Paleobotany|paleobotanist]] graduate student, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Ellen Sattler|Ellie Sattler]], are contacted to confirm the identification, but are abruptly whisked away by billionaire [[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Hammond|John Hammond]]&nbsp;\u2014 founder and chief executive officer of International Genetic Technologies, or InGen&nbsp;\u2014 for a weekend visit to a \"biological preserve\" he has established on Isla Nublar.\n\nUpon arrival, the preserve is revealed to be Jurassic Park, a [[Amusement park|theme park]] showcasing [[Cloning#Artificial cloning of organisms|cloned]] dinosaurs. The animals have been recreated using [[Ancient DNA|damaged dinosaur DNA]] found in blood inside of gnats, ticks, and mosquitoes fossilized and preserved in [[amber]]. Gaps in the genetic code have been filled in with \"compatible\" [[Reptile|reptilian]], [[Bird|avian]] or [[amphibian]] [[DNA]]. To control the population, all specimens on the island are [[lysine]]-[[Auxotrophy|deficient]] and X-Ray sterilized females. Hammond proudly touts InGen's advances in [[genetic engineering]] and shows his guests through the island's vast array of automated systems.\n\n[[File:Curva del drag\u00f3n.png|thumb|left|Ian Malcolm created [[dragon curve]]s to simulate the actions that were to take place in the park.]]\n\nRecent incidents in the park have spooked Hammond's investors. To placate them, Hammond uses Grant and Sattler as fresh consultants. They stand in counterbalance to a famous mathematician and [[Chaos theory|chaos theorist]], [[Ian Malcolm (character)|Ian Malcolm]], and a lawyer representing the investors, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Donald Gennaro|Donald Gennaro]], who are pessimistic about the park's prospects. Malcolm, having been consulted before the park's creation, is especially emphatic in his prediction that the park will collapse, as it is an unsustainable simple structure bluntly forced upon a [[complex system]] with too many unpredictable variables, such as an uncontrollable population, attempting to contain animals with no real equivalent to extant animals with no predictable behavior patterns, and an untested computer system that continually fails to monitor and feed the population.\n\nCountering Malcolm's dire predictions with youthful energy, Hammond groups the consultants with his grandchildren, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Timothy Murphy|Tim]] and [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Alexis Murphy|Alexis \"Lex\" Murphy]]. While touring the park, Grant finds a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' eggshell, seemingly proving Malcolm's earlier assertion that the dinosaurs have somehow been breeding against the geneticists' design.\n\nMeanwhile, the disgruntled chief programmer of Jurassic Park's controlling software, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dennis Nedry|Dennis Nedry]], attempts [[Industrial espionage|corporate espionage]] for [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Lewis Dodgson|Lewis Dodgson]], a geneticist and agent of InGen's archrival, Biosyn. By activating a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] he wrote into the park's computer system, Nedry shuts down its security systems and steals frozen embryos for each of the park's fifteen species in an attempt to smuggle them to a contact waiting at an auxiliary dock at the eastern end of the park. However, during a sudden [[Tropical cyclone#Tropical storm|tropical storm]], he exits his vehicle to get his bearings and is killed by a ''[[Dilophosaurus]]''. Without Nedry to reactivate the park's security, the electrified fences remain off and all the dinosaurs escape. The park's adult ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' attacks the guests on tour, with a juvenile ''T. rex'' attacking and killing Ed Regis, the park's public relations manager. In the aftermath, Grant and the children become lost in the park. Malcolm is gravely injured during the incident, but is found by Gennaro and park game warden [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Robert Muldoon|Robert Muldoon]], spending the remainder of the novel slowly dying as {{ndash}} between lucid lectures and morphine-induced rants {{ndash}} he tries to help the others understand their predicament and survive.\n\nThe park's upper management&nbsp;\u2014 engineer and park supervisor [[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Raymond Arnold|John Arnold]], [[biotechnology|biotechnologist]] [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Henry Wu|Henry Wu]], Muldoon, and Hammond&nbsp;\u2014 struggle to return power to the park, while the veterinarian, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Harding|Dr. Harding]], takes care of Malcolm.

He alleges that the parameters of debate on a given topic are very consciously curtailed. He says that since the network maintains studios in ideological centers of opinion such as Washington, the network feels the necessity to carefully consider what kinds of dissenting opinion are acceptable. Thus, political pragmatism, perhaps induced by fear of offending public officials who control some of NPR's funding (via CPB), often determines what views are suitable for broadcast, meaning that opinions critical of the structures of national-interest-based foreign policy, capitalism, and government bureaucracies (entailed by so-called \"radical\" or \"activist\" politics) usually do not make it to air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.zcommunications.org/chomsky/sld/sld-1-09.html |title=Secrets, Lies and Democracy (Interviews with Noam Chomsky) |publisher=Books.zcommunications.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Study results===\nConsumers of information from NPR contend that NPR does its job well.

He alleges that the parameters of debate on a given topic are very consciously curtailed. He says that since the network maintains studios in ideological centers of opinion such as Washington, the network feels the necessity to carefully consider what kinds of dissenting opinion are acceptable. Thus, political pragmatism, perhaps induced by fear of offending public officials who control some of NPR's funding (via CPB), often determines what views are suitable for broadcast, meaning that opinions critical of the structures of national-interest-based foreign policy, capitalism, and government bureaucracies (entailed by so-called \"radical\" or \"activist\" politics) usually do not make it to air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.zcommunications.org/chomsky/sld/sld-1-09.html |title=Secrets, Lies and Democracy (Interviews with Noam Chomsky) |publisher=Books.zcommunications.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Study results===\nConsumers of information from NPR contend that NPR does its job well.
