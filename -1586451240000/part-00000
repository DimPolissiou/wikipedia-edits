As noted by Jost (2009), within the context of Western political development, opposition to change is often synonymous with support for inequality. Notwithstanding its prominence in the literature, we are hesitant to adopt this definition of the right since it requires the researcher to interpret ideological claims according to an abstract understanding of equality. For instance, Noel & Therien (2008) argue that right-wing opposition to affirmative action speaks in the name of equality and rejects positive discrimination based on demographic factors. From this perspective, the right is not inegalitarian but is \u201cdifferently egalitarian\u201d (Noel & Therien 2008, p. 18).|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dziblatt/files/gidron_and_ziblatt_2019.pdf|DOI=10.1146/annurev-polisci-090717-092750}}</ref> or the competition in [[market economies]].<ref>Scruton, Roger \"A Dictionary of Political Thought\" \"Defined by contrast to (or perhaps more accurately conflict with) the left the term right does not even have the respectability of a history.

Both the conservatives and the liberals were strongly [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]]. The history of the use of the term \"right-wing\" in reference to anti-communism is a complicated one.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hendershot|first1=Cyndy|title=Anti-Communism and Popular Culture in Mid-Century America|date=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0786414406}}</ref>\n\nEarly Marxist movements were at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the [[Europe]]an continent at the time. Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views and the ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'', which began \"[a] spectre [that] is haunting Europe\", stated that monarchs feared for their thrones. Advocacy of communism was illegal in the [[Russian Empire]], the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to [[World War I]]. Many monarchists (except [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchists]]) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order. The struggle between monarchists and communists was often described as a struggle between the Right and the Left.\n\nBy [[World War I]], in most European monarchies, the divine right of kings had become discredited and was replaced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements. Most European monarchs became figureheads or they accepted a lesser degree of powers while elected governments held the day-to-day power. The most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Russian Revolution]] inspired a series of other [[Revolutions of 1917\u20131923|communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917\u20131923]]. Many of these, such as the [[German Revolution]], were defeated by nationalist and monarchist military units. During this period, nationalism began to be considered right-wing, especially when it opposed the internationalism of the communists.\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw the decline of traditional right-wing politics. The mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising [[Fascism|fascist]] movements on the one hand and by [[United States|American]]-inspired [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] on the other. When communist groups and political parties began appearing around the world, their opponents were usually [[Colonialism|colonial authorities]] and the term right-wing came to be applied to [[colonialism]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], communism became a global phenomenon and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies. Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religious values and nationalism. Throughout the [[Cold War]], colonial governments in [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] turned to the United States for political and economic support. Communists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying [[Wall Street]] as the oppressor of the masses. The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term \"[[McCarthyism]]\". While both liberals and conservatives were anti-communist, the followers of Senator McCarthy were called right-wing and those on the right called liberals who favored free speech, even for communists; leftist.\n\n=== Economics ===\nIn France after the French Revolution, the Right fought against the rising power of those who had grown rich through commerce and sought to preserve the rights of the hereditary nobility. They were uncomfortable with capitalism, the Enlightenment, individualism and industrialism and fought to retain traditional social hierarchies and institutions.<ref name=\"Parliaments 1988 pp. 287\u2013302\"/><ref name=\"Appleby\">{{cite book|last1=Marty|first1=Martin E.|last2=Appleby|first2=R.

Paulist Press, 2003, p. 132.</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the Right had shifted to support the newly rich in some European countries (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing movements, such as [[Carlism]] in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany and Russia, remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism. However, there are still a few right-wing movements today, notably the French [[Nouvelle Droite]], [[CasaPound]] and American [[paleoconservatives]], that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society as a whole, which they see as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that they see as essential for social order.<ref name=\"Fascism\">{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=Stanley G.|title=Fascism: Comparison and Definition|date=1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisc.|isbn=978-0-299-08064-8|page=19|quote=Right radicals and conservative authoritarians almost without exception became corporatists in formal doctrines of political economy, but the fascists were less explicit and in general less schematic.}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, \"right-wing\" is sometimes used to describe [[Laissez-faire|''laissez-faire'' capitalism]].

Both the conservatives and the liberals were strongly [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]]. The history of the use of the term \"right-wing\" in reference to anti-communism is a complicated one.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hendershot|first1=Cyndy|title=Anti-Communism and Popular Culture in Mid-Century America|date=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0786414406}}</ref>\n\nEarly Marxist movements were at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the [[Europe]]an continent at the time. Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views and the ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'', which began \"[a] spectre [that] is haunting Europe\", stated that monarchs feared for their thrones. Advocacy of communism was illegal in the [[Russian Empire]], the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to [[World War I]]. Many monarchists (except [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchists]]) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order. The struggle between monarchists and communists was often described as a struggle between the Right and the Left.\n\nBy [[World War I]], in most European monarchies, the divine right of kings had become discredited and was replaced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements. Most European monarchs became figureheads or they accepted a lesser degree of powers while elected governments held the day-to-day power. The most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Russian Revolution]] inspired a series of other [[Revolutions of 1917\u20131923|communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917\u20131923]]. Many of these, such as the [[German Revolution]], were defeated by nationalist and monarchist military units. During this period, nationalism began to be considered right-wing, especially when it opposed the internationalism of the communists.\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw the decline of traditional right-wing politics. The mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising [[Fascism|fascist]] movements on the one hand and by [[United States|American]]-inspired [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] on the other. When communist groups and political parties began appearing around the world, their opponents were usually [[Colonialism|colonial authorities]] and the term right-wing came to be applied to [[colonialism]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], communism became a global phenomenon and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies. Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religious values and nationalism. Throughout the [[Cold War]], colonial governments in [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] turned to the United States for political and economic support. Communists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying [[Wall Street]] as the oppressor of the masses. The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term \"[[McCarthyism]]\". While both liberals and conservatives were anti-communist, the followers of Senator McCarthy were called right-wing and those on the right called liberals who favored free speech, even for communists; leftist.\n\n=== Economics ===\nIn France after the French Revolution, the Right fought against the rising power of those who had grown rich through commerce and sought to preserve the rights of the hereditary nobility. They were uncomfortable with capitalism, the Enlightenment, individualism and industrialism and fought to retain traditional social hierarchies and institutions.<ref name=\"Parliaments 1988 pp. 287\u2013302\"/><ref name=\"Appleby\">{{cite book|last1=Marty|first1=Martin E.|last2=Appleby|first2=R.

Paulist Press, 2003, p. 132.</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the Right had shifted to support the newly rich in some European countries (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing movements, such as [[Carlism]] in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany and Russia, remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism. However, there are still a few right-wing movements today, notably the French [[Nouvelle Droite]], [[CasaPound]] and American [[paleoconservatives]], that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society as a whole, which they see as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that they see as essential for social order.<ref name=\"Fascism\">{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=Stanley G.|title=Fascism: Comparison and Definition|date=1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisc.|isbn=978-0-299-08064-8|page=19|quote=Right radicals and conservative authoritarians almost without exception became corporatists in formal doctrines of political economy, but the fascists were less explicit and in general less schematic.}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, \"right-wing\" is sometimes used to describe [[Laissez-faire|''laissez-faire'' capitalism]].
