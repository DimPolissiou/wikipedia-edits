[[Greater Orlando|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==Etymology==\nOsceola County is named for the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] leader [[Osceola]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Publications of the Florida Historical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZQ-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA33|year=1908|publisher=Florida Historical Society|page=33}}</ref> whose name means \"Black Drink Cry [Asi Yaholo]\".\n\n==History==\nOsceola County was created in 1887. On July 21, 1821, Florida was divided into two counties, named [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia County]] to the west and [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. John's County]] to the east. In 1824, the southern part of St. John's County became [[Orange County, Florida#History|Mosquito County]], with [[Enterprise, Florida|Enterprise]] as the [[county seat]]. In 1844, [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard County]] was carved out from Mosquito County. When Florida became a state in 1845, Mosquito County was renamed [[Orange County, Florida#History|Orange County]].  On May 12, 1887, Osceola was named a county, having been created from both Orange and Brevard Counties. Osceola County reached all the way down to [[Lake Okeechobee]] until 1917 when [[Okeechobee County, Florida|Okeechobee County]] was formed.\n\nSince the late 20th century, Osceola County has experienced a significant influx of migrants from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the unincorporated territory of the United States,<ref>{{cite web|last=Rohter |first=Larry |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E0DB1539F932A05752C0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=A Puerto Rican Boom for Florida - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=1994-01-31 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> and in the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. Census]] Puerto Rican was the largest self-reported ancestry group.<ref>[[:Image:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.jpg]]</ref>\n\n==Government==\nOsceola County is a [[charter county]], and a subdivision within the [[Florida|State of Florida]]. Voters approved the County Charter in March 1992, and it took effect on October 1, 1992. The structure of County government under the charter does not depart dramatically from the structure of a County government outlined in the [[Florida Statutes]].\n\nOsceola County Government is governed by three sets of [[election|elected]] [[official]]s, each of which independently directs separate branches of County Government. These include: the five-member County Commission, five separate Constitutional Officers, and a number of Judicial Officers. Under State law, the County Commission is responsible for funding the budgets of all Osceola County Government, including the independently elected Constitutional Officers and Judicial Officers, as well as the Commission's own departments. Each independent officer has discretion to administer his or her own programs. The County Commission exercises oversight only over its own departments.\n\nOsceola County has five electoral districts each represented by a commissioner. All the commissioners compose the Board of Commissioners that appoint a County Manager. There also is a Commission Auditor and County Attorney.\n\n===Legislature===\n;Board of County Commissioners\n* District 1 - Peggy Choudhry ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* District 2 - [[Viviana Janer(politician)|Viviana Janer]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* District 3 - Brandon Arrington ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* District 4 - [[Cheryl Grieb]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* District 5 - Fred Hawkins, Jr. ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]])\n\n===Executive===\n* County Manager\n** Deputy County Manager\n* Commission Auditor\n* County Attorney\n\n===Constitutional Officers===\n* Sheriff - Russell Gibson ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* Property Appraiser - Katrina Scarborough ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* Clerk of the Courts - Armando Ramirez ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* Supervisor of Elections - Mary Jane Arrington ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* Tax Collector - Bruce Vickers ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* Public Defender - Bob Wesley [http://www.osceola.org/files/Websites/AboutOsceola/00000000_document/032411_OsceolaCountyOrgChart_FY2011.pdf Ocseola County Organizational Chart] -\n* State Attorney - Aramis Ayala<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sao9.net/|title=Office of the State Attorney Ninth Judicial Circuit|access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Voter registration===\n{| class=wikitable\n! colspan = 6 |Registered Voters as of August 10, 2019<ref>{{cite web|title = Active Registered Voters as of 8/10/19 | publisher = Osceola County Supervisor of Elections | accessdate = 2019-08-10 | url = https://www.voteosceola.com/en/?display=desktop }}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

On July 21, 1821, Florida was divided into two counties, named [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia County]] to the west and [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. John's County]] to the east. In 1824, the southern part of St. John's County became [[Orange County, Florida#History|Mosquito County]], with [[Enterprise, Florida|Enterprise]] as the [[county seat]]. In 1844, [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard County]] was carved out from Mosquito County. When Florida became a state in 1845, Mosquito County was renamed [[Orange County, Florida#History|Orange County]].  On May 12, 1887, Osceola was named a county, having been created from both Orange and Brevard Counties. Osceola County reached all the way down to [[Lake Okeechobee]] until 1917 when [[Okeechobee County, Florida|Okeechobee County]] was formed.\n\nSince the late 20th century, Osceola County has experienced a significant influx of migrants from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the unincorporated territory of the United States,<ref>{{cite web|last=Rohter |first=Larry |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E0DB1539F932A05752C0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=A Puerto Rican Boom for Florida - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=1994-01-31 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> and in the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. Census]] Puerto Rican was the largest self-reported ancestry group.<ref>[[:Image:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.jpg]]</ref>\n\n==Government==\nOsceola County is a [[charter county]], and a subdivision within the [[Florida|State of Florida]]. Voters approved the County Charter in March 1992, and it took effect on October 1, 1992. The structure of County government under the charter does not depart dramatically from the structure of a County government outlined in the [[Florida Statutes]].\n\nOsceola County Government is governed by three sets of [[election|elected]] [[official]]s, each of which independently directs separate branches of County Government. These include: the five-member County Commission, five separate Constitutional Officers, and a number of Judicial Officers. Under State law, the County Commission is responsible for funding the budgets of all Osceola County Government, including the independently elected Constitutional Officers and Judicial Officers, as well as the Commission's own departments. Each independent officer has discretion to administer his or her own programs. The County Commission exercises oversight only over its own departments.\n\nOsceola County has five electoral districts each represented by a commissioner. All the commissioners compose the Board of Commissioners that appoint a County Manager. There also is a Commission Auditor and County Attorney.\n\n===Legislature===\n;Board of County Commissioners\n*District 1 - Peggy Choudhry ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n*District 2 - [[Viviana Janer(politician)|Viviana Janer]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n*District 3 - Brandon Arrington ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n*District 4 - [[Cheryl Grieb]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n*District 5 - Fred Hawkins, Jr. ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]])\n\n===Executive===\n* County Manager\n** Deputy County Manager\n* Commission Auditor\n* County Attorney\n\n===Constitutional Officers===\n* Sheriff - Russell Gibson ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* Property Appraiser - Katrina Scarborough ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* Clerk of the Courts - Armando Ramirez ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* Supervisor of Elections - Mary Jane Arrington ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* Tax Collector - Bruce Vickers ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n* Public Defender - Bob Wesley [http://www.osceola.org/files/Websites/AboutOsceola/00000000_document/032411_OsceolaCountyOrgChart_FY2011.pdf Ocseola County Organizational Chart] -\n* State Attorney - Aramis Ayala<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sao9.net/|title=Office of the State Attorney Ninth Judicial Circuit|access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Voter registration===\n{| class=wikitable\n! colspan = 6 |Registered Voters as of August 10, 2019<ref>{{cite web|title = Active Registered Voters as of 8/10/19 | publisher = Osceola County Supervisor of Elections | accessdate = 2019-08-10 | url = https://www.voteosceola.com/en/?display=desktop }}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

Identity theft occurs when someone uses another's personally identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or [[credit card number]], without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term ''identity theft'' was coined in 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50111220/50111220se23  |title=Oxford English Dictionary online|date=September 2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 September 2010 }}</ref> Since that time, the definition of identity theft has been statutorily prescribed throughout both the U.K. and the United States as the theft of personally identifiable information, generally including a person's name, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, bank account or credit card numbers, [[PIN number]]s, [[electronic signature]]s, fingerprints, [[password]]s, or any other information that can be used to access a person's financial resources.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Wisconsin Statutes, Sec. 943.201.

Someone can steal or misappropriate personal information without then committing identity theft using the information about every person, such as when a major data breach occurs. A US Government Accountability Office study determined that \"most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07737.pdf |title=Data Breaches Are Frequent, but Evidence of Resulting Identity Theft Is Limited; However, the Full Extent Is Unknown |author= |date= |work=Highlights of GAO-07-737, a report to congressional requesters |publisher=gao.gov |accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref> The report also warned that \"the full extent is unknown\". A later unpublished study by Carnegie Mellon University noted that \"Most often, the causes of identity theft is not known\", but reported that someone else concluded that \"the probability of becoming a victim to identity theft as a result of a data breach is ... around only 2%\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/research/241full.pdf |title=Do Data Breach Disclosure Laws Reduce Identity Theft? |author=Sasha Romanosky |date= |work=Heinz First Research Paper |publisher=heinz.cmu.edu |accessdate=}}</ref> More recently,{{when|date=January 2020}} an association of consumer data companies noted that one of the largest data breaches ever, accounting for over four million records, resulted in only about 1,800 instances of identity theft, according to the company whose systems were breached.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nAn October 2010 article entitled \"Cyber Crime Made Easy\" explained the level to which hackers are using [[malicious software]].<ref name=\"Giles2010\">{{cite journal | last=Giles | first=Jim | title=Cyber crime made easy | journal=New Scientist | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=205 | issue=2752 | year=2010 | issn=0262-4079 | doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(10)60647-1 | pages=20\u201321}}</ref> As Gunter Ollmann,\nChief Technology Officer of security at Microsoft, said, \"Interested in credit card theft?  There's an app for that.\"  This statement summed up the ease with which these hackers are accessing all kinds of information online.  The new program for infecting users' computers was called [[Zeus (malware)|Zeus]]; and the program is so hacker-friendly that even an inexperienced hacker can operate it.  Although the hacking program is easy to use, that fact does not diminish the devastating effects that Zeus (or other software like Zeus) can do to a computer and the user.  For example, the article stated that programs like Zeus can steal credit card information, important documents, and even documents necessary for [[homeland security]].  If the hacker were to gain this information, it would mean identity theft or even a possible terrorist attack. The [[Integrated Threat Assessment Centre|ITAC]] says that about 15 million Americans are having their identity stolen, in 2012.<ref>https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/vit12.pdf</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nSources such as the [[Non-profit]] [[Identity Theft Resource Center]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org/ |title=Identity Theft Resource Center website |author= |date= |publisher=idtheftcenter.org |accessdate=  }}</ref> sub-divide identity theft into five categories:\n* Criminal identity theft (posing as another person when apprehended for a crime)\n* Financial identity theft (using another's identity to obtain credit, goods and services)\n* Identity cloning (using another's information to assume his or her identity in daily life)\n* Medical identity theft (using another's identity to obtain medical care or drugs)\n* Child identity theft.\n\nIdentity theft may be used to facilitate or fund other crimes including [[Illegal immigration]], [[terrorism]], [[phishing]] and [[espionage]]. There are cases of identity cloning to attack [[payment system]]s, including online credit card processing and [[medical insurance]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/medidtheft_consumertips.html |title=Medical Identity Theft: What to Do if You are a Victim (or are concerned about it) }}, World Privacy Forum</ref>\n\n=== Identity cloning and concealment ===\nIn this situation the identity thief impersonates someone else in order to conceal their own true identity. Examples are [[illegal immigrant]]s hiding their illegal status, people hiding from [[creditor]]s or other individuals, and those who simply want to become \"[[Anonymity|anonymous]]\" for personal reasons. Another example is ''posers'', a label given to people who use someone else's photos and information on social networking sites. Posers mostly create believable stories involving friends of the real person they are imitating. Unlike identity theft used to obtain credit which usually comes to light when the debts mount, concealment may continue indefinitely without being detected, particularly if the identity thief is able to obtain false credentials in order to pass various authentication tests in everyday life.\n\n=== Criminal identity theft ===\nWhen a criminal fraudulently identifies themselves to police as another individual at the point of arrest, it is sometimes referred to as \"Criminal Identity Theft.\" In some cases, criminals have previously obtained state-issued identity documents using credentials stolen from others, or have simply presented a [[fake ID]]. Provided the subterfuge works, charges may be placed under the victim's name, letting the criminal off the hook. Victims might only learn of such incidents by chance, for example by receiving a court summons, discovering their drivers licenses are suspended when stopped for minor traffic violations, or through [[background check]]s performed for employment purposes.\n\nIt can be difficult for the victim of a criminal identity theft to clear their record. The steps required to clear the victim's incorrect [[criminal record]] depend in which jurisdiction the crime occurred and whether the true identity of the criminal can be determined. The victim might need to locate the original arresting officers and prove their own identity by some reliable means such as fingerprinting or DNA testing, and may need to go to a court hearing to be cleared of the charges. Obtaining an [[expungement]] of court records may also be required. Authorities might permanently maintain the victim's name as an alias for the criminal's true identity in their criminal records databases. One problem that victims of criminal identity theft may encounter is that various [[data aggregators]] might still have the incorrect criminal records in their databases even after court and police records are corrected. Thus it is possible that a future background check will return the incorrect criminal records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs17g-CrimIdTheft.htm |title=Privacy Rights Clearinghouse |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120921/http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs17g-CrimIdTheft.htm |archive-date=21 September 2012 |df= }} - \"Fact Sheet 17g: Criminal Identity Theft: What to Do if It Happens to You \"</ref> This is just one example of the kinds of impact that may continue to affect the victims of identity theft for some months or even years after the crime, aside from the psychological trauma that being 'cloned' typically engenders.\n\n=== Synthetic identity theft ===\nA variation of identity theft which has recently become more common is ''synthetic identity theft'', in which identities are completely or partially fabricated.<ref>[http://www.leagle.com/decision/2009567417bbr150_1566 In re Marie A.

Synthetic identity theft primarily harms the creditors who unwittingly grant the fraudsters credit. Individual victims can be affected if their names become confused with the synthetic identities, or if negative information in their subfiles impacts their credit ratings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/pf/identity_theft_20070516_a1.asp |title=Detecting synthetic identity fraud |accessdate=21 September 2008 |last=McFadden |first=Leslie |date=16 May 2007 |work=Bankrate.com |pages=1\u20132 |doi=   |quote=  }}</ref>\n\n=== Medical identity theft ===\n{{see also|Medical privacy}}\n[[File:Figure 2- Risk of Identity Theft with Medicare Card under CMS\u2019s Three Proposed Options (7802334168).jpg|thumb|US [[Government Accountability Office]] diagram showing the identity theft risk associated with social security numbers on [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare cards]]]]\n\nPrivacy researcher Pam Dixon, the founder of the World Privacy Forum,<ref>https://www.worldprivacyforum.org/</ref> coined the term medical identity theft and released the first major report about this issue in 2006. In the report, she defined the crime for the first time and made the plight of victims public. The report's definition of the crime is that medical identity theft occurs when someone seeks medical care under the identity of another person. Insurance theft is also very common, if a thief has your insurance information and or your insurance card, they can seek medical attention posing as yourself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.igrad.com/articles/8-types-of-identity-theft|title=Get to Know These Common Types of ID Theft|website=iGrad|access-date=29 September 2016}}</ref>  In addition to risks of financial harm common to all forms of identity theft, the thief's medical history may be added to the victim's [[medical record]]s. Inaccurate information in the victim's records is difficult to correct and may affect future insurability or cause doctors relying on the misinformation to deliver inappropriate care. After the publication of the report, which contained a recommendation that consumers receive notifications of medical data breach incidents, California passed a law requiring this, and then finally HIPAA was expanded to also require medical breach notification when breaches affect 500 or more people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/medicalidentitytheft.html|title=The Medical Identity Theft Information Page|author=|date=|publisher=World Privacy Forum|access-date=26 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130416062351/http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/medicalidentitytheft.html|archive-date=16 April 2013|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org/artman2/publish/v_fact_sheets/Fact_Sheet_130_A_Correcting_Misinformation_on_Medical_Records.shtml |title=Correcting Misinformation on Medical Records |author= |date= |publisher=Identity Theft Resource Center |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123025205/http://www.idtheftcenter.org/artman2/publish/v_fact_sheets/Fact_Sheet_130_A_Correcting_Misinformation_on_Medical_Records.shtml |archive-date=23 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Data collected and stored by hospitals and other organizations such as medical aid schemes is up to 10 times more valuable to cybercriminals than credit card information.\n\n=== Child identity theft ===\nChild identity theft occurs when a minor's identity is used by another person for the impostor's personal gain. The impostor can be a family member, a friend, or even a stranger who targets children. The Social Security numbers of children are valued because they do not have any information associated with them.  Thieves can establish lines of credit, obtain driver's licenses, or even buy a house using a child's identity. This fraud can go undetected for years, as most children do not discover the problem until years later.  Child identity theft is fairly common, and studies have shown that the problem is growing. The largest study on child identity theft, as reported by Richard Power of the [[Carnegie Mellon]] Cylab with data supplied by [[AllClear ID]], found that of 40,000 children, 10.2% were victims of identity theft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/government-turns-spotlight-on-child-id-theft-problem|title=Government Turns Spotlight on Child ID Theft Problem|date=12 January 2016|website=CreditCards.com|language=en-US|access-date=22 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) estimates that about nine million people will be victims of identity theft in the United States per year. It was also estimated that in 2008 630,000 people under the age of 19 were victims of theft. This then gave them a debt of about $12,799 which was not theirs.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A317310399/AONE?u=sunybuff_main&sid=AONE&xid=8502170b.|title=Protecting and defending a young person in foster care from financial identity theft|last=Clemente|first=Jean|date=Feb 2010|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nNot only are children in general big targets of identity theft but children who are in foster care are even bigger targets. This is because they are most likely moved around quite frequently and their SSN is being shared with multiple people and agencies. Foster children are even more victims of identity theft within their own family and other relatives. Young people in foster care who are victims of this crime are usually left alone to struggle and figure out how to fix their newly formed bad credit.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Financial identity theft ===\nThe most common type is financial identity theft, where someone wants to gain economical benefits in someone else's name. This includes getting credits, loans, goods and services, claiming to be someone else.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org/Identity-Theft/what-is-financial-identity-theft.html |title=What is Financial Identity Theft |author= |date= |publisher=ID Theft Center |accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Tax identity theft ===\nOne of the major identity theft categories is tax identity theft. Tax identity theft occurs when someone gains another persons information and uses that to receive a tax refund. The thief in this case can also try to get a job and then their employer will report the income of the real taxpayer, this then results in the taxpayer getting in trouble with the IRS.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.citrincooperman.com/infocus/identity-theft-tax-and-financial-consideration|title=Identity Theft; Tax and Financial Consideration|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe 14039 Form to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] is a form that will help one fight against a theft like tax theft. This form will put the IRS on alert and someone who believed they have been a victim of tax related theft will be given an Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN), which is a 6 digit code used in replace of a SSN for filing tax returns.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n== Techniques for obtaining and exploiting personal information ==\nIdentity thieves typically obtain and exploit [[personally identifiable information]] about individuals, or various credentials they use to authenticate themselves, in order to impersonate them. Examples include:\n* Rummaging through rubbish for personal information ([[Dumpster diving#Information diving|dumpster diving]])\n* Retrieving personal data from redundant IT equipment and storage media including PCs, servers, PDAs, mobile phones, USB memory sticks and hard drives that have been disposed of carelessly at public dump sites, given away or sold on without having been properly sanitized\n* Using [[public records]] about individual citizens, published in official registers such as electoral rolls<ref>{{cite news | last=Loviglio | first=Joann| url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46874551| title= If Microsoft co-founder's ID isn't safe, is yours? | work= NBC News |date= March 2012 }}</ref>\n* Stealing bank or credit cards, identification cards, passports, authentication tokens ... typically by [[pickpocketing]], [[burglary|housebreaking]] or mail [[theft]]\n* Common-knowledge questioning schemes that offer [[account verification]], such as \"What's your mother's maiden name?\", \"what was your first car model?\", or \"What was your first pet's name?\".\n* [[Skimming (credit card fraud)|Skimming]] information from bank or credit cards using compromised or hand-held card readers, and creating clone cards\n* Using [[Wireless identity theft|'contactless' credit card readers]] to acquire data wirelessly from [[RFID]]-enabled passports\n* Shoulder-Surfing, involves an individual who discreetly watches or hears others providing valuable personal information. This is particularly done in crowded places because it is relatively easy to observe someone as they fill out forms, enter PIN numbers on ATMs or even type passwords on smartphones.\n* Stealing personal information from computers using breaches in [[browser security]] or [[malware]] such as [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] [[keystroke logging]] programs or other forms of [[spyware]]\n* [[Hacker (computer security)|Hacking]] computer networks, systems and databases to obtain personal data, often in large quantities\n* Exploiting [[Data breach|breaches]] that result in the publication or more limited disclosure of personal information such as names, addresses, [[Social Security number]] or credit card numbers\n* Advertising bogus job offers in order to accumulate [[curriculum vitae|resumes]] and applications typically disclosing applicants' names, home and email addresses, telephone numbers and sometimes their banking details\n* Exploiting insider access and abusing the rights of privileged IT users to access personal data on their employers' systems\n* Infiltrating organizations that store and process large amounts or particularly valuable personal information\n* Impersonating trusted organizations in emails, SMS text messages, phone calls or other forms of communication in order to dupe victims into disclosing their personal information or login credentials, typically on a fake corporate website or data collection form ([[phishing]])\n* Brute-force attacking weak passwords and using inspired guesswork to compromise weak password reset questions\n* Obtaining castings of fingers for falsifying [[fingerprint identification]].\n* Browsing [[social network service|social networking]] websites for personal details published by users, often using this information to appear more credible in subsequent social engineering activities\n* Diverting victims' email or post in order to obtain personal information and credentials such as credit cards, billing and bank/credit card statements, or to delay the discovery of new accounts and credit agreements opened by the identity thieves in the victims' names\n* Using false pretenses to trick individuals, customer service representatives and help desk workers into disclosing personal information and login details or changing user passwords/access rights ([[pretexting]])\n* Stealing [[Cheque|cheques (checks)]] to acquire banking information, including account numbers and [[bank code]]s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.douglascountysheriff.org/idtheft/idtheftmain.htm |title=Identity Theft }}, Douglas County Sheriff's Office, Washington</ref>\n* Guessing Social Security numbers by using information found on Internet social networks such as [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Olmos |first=David |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aKbjO.Ew4S2E |title=Social Security Numbers Can Be Guessed From Data, Study Finds |publisher=Bloomberg |date=6 July 2009 |access-date=4 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617002156/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aKbjO.Ew4S2E |archive-date=17 June 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n* Low security/privacy protection on photos that are easily clickable and downloaded on [[social networking]] sites.\n* Befriending strangers on social networks and taking advantage of their trust until private information is given.\n\n== Indicators ==\nThe majority of identity theft victims do not realize that they are a victim until it has negatively impacted their lives.

For consumers, this is usually a result of them naively providing their personal information or login credentials to the identity thieves (e.g., in a [[phishing attack]]) but identity-related documents such as credit cards, bank statements, utility bills, checkbooks etc. may also be physically stolen from vehicles, homes, offices, and not the least [[letterboxes]], or directly from victims by pickpockets and bag snatchers. Guardianship of personal identifiers by consumers is the most common intervention strategy recommended by the [[US Federal Trade Commission]], [[PhoneBusters|Canadian Phone Busters]] and most sites that address identity theft. Such organizations offer recommendations on how individuals can prevent their information falling into the wrong hands.\n\nIdentity theft can be partially mitigated by ''not'' identifying oneself unnecessarily (a form of information security control known as risk avoidance). This implies that organizations, IT systems and procedures should not demand excessive amounts of personal information or credentials for identification and authentication. Requiring, storing and processing personal identifiers (such as [[Social Security number]], [[national identification number]], driver's license number, credit card number, etc.) increases the risks of identity theft unless this valuable personal information is adequately secured at all times.  Committing personal identifiers to memory is a sound practice that can reduce the risks of a would-be identity thief from obtaining these records.  To help in remembering numbers such as social security numbers and credit card numbers, it is helpful to consider using mnemonic techniques or memory aids such as the [[Mnemonic major system|mnemonic Major System]].\n\nIdentity thieves sometimes impersonate dead people, using personal information obtained from death notices, gravestones and other sources to exploit delays between the death and the closure of the person's accounts, the inattentiveness of grieving families and weaknesses in the processes for credit-checking. Such crimes may continue for some time until the deceased's families or the authorities notice and react to anomalies.<ref>[http://www.idtheftcenter.org/Fact-Sheets/fs-117.html IDtheftcenter.org<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417074200/http://www.idtheftcenter.org/Fact-Sheets/fs-117.html|date=17 April 2016}}, Identity Theft Resource Center Fact Sheet 117 Identity Theft and the Deceased - Prevention and Victim Tips.</ref>\n\nIn recent years{{When|date=September 2018}}, commercial identity theft protection/insurance services have become available in many countries.

Some states have now amended relevant criminal laws to reflect crimes of identity theft, such as the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA), Crimes Amendment (Fraud, Identity and Forgery Offences) Act 2009 and also in Queensland under the Criminal Code 1899 (QLD). Other states and territories are in states of development in respect of regulatory frameworks relating to identity theft such as Western Australia in respect of Criminal Code Amendment (Identity Crime) Bill 2009.\n\nAt the Commonwealth level, under the ''Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery & Related Offences) Act 2000'' which amended certain provisions within the ''Criminal Code Act 1995'',\n\nBetween 2014 and 2015, in Australia there were 133,921 fraud and deception offences, an increase of 6% from previous year.

The Commonwealth ''Privacy Act'' is applicable only to Commonwealth and territory agencies, and to certain private sector bodies (where for example they deal with sensitive records, such as medical records, or they have more than $3 million turnover PA).\n\n=== Canada ===\nUnder section 402.2 of the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]],''\n{{quote|Everyone commits an offence who knowingly obtains or possesses another person's identity information in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference that the information is intended to be used to commit an indictable offence that includes fraud, deceit or falsehood as an element of the offence.\nis guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years; or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.}}\n\nUnder section 403 of the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]],''\n{{quote|(1) Everyone commits an offence who fraudulently personates another person, living or dead,\n(a) with intent to gain advantage for themselves or another person;\n(b) with intent to obtain any property or an interest in any property;\n(c) with intent to cause disadvantage to the person being personated or another person; or\n(d) with intent to avoid arrest or prosecution or to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.\nis guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years; or guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.}}\n\nIn Canada, ''Privacy Act'' (federal legislation) covers only federal government, agencies and [[crown corporations]]. Each province and territory has its own privacy law and privacy commissioners to limit the storage and use of personal data.\nFor the private sector, the purpose of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ( 2000, c. 5 ) (known as PIPEDA) is to establish rules to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information; except for the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia where provincial laws have been deemed substantially similar.\n\n=== France ===\nIn France, a person convicted of identity theft can be sentenced up to five years in prison and fined up to [[euro|\u20ac]]75,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journaldunet.com/juridique/juridique040309.shtml |title=Journaldunet.com }}</ref>\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\nUnder HK Laws.

There are people who meet online, get to know each other through the free Facebook chat and exchange of messages that then leads to sharing of private information.  Others get romantically involved with their online friends that they tend to give too much information such as their social security number, bank account and even personal basic information such as home address and company address.\n\nThis phenomenon lead to the creation of Senate Bill 52: Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2010.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/document/59428205/Senate-Bill-52-Cyber-Crime-Prevention-Act Full Text of Senate Bill 52 (Proposing the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2010)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816172609/https://www.scribd.com/document/59428205/Senate-Bill-52-Cyber-Crime-Prevention-Act |date=16 August 2016 }}</ref> Section 2 of this bill states that it recognizes the importance of [[communication]] and [[multimedia]] for the development, exploitation and dissemination of information but violators will be punished by the law through imprisonment or a fine upwards of Php200,000, but not exceeding 1 million, or depending on the damage caused, or both (Section 7).\n\n=== Sweden ===\nSweden has had relatively few problems with identity theft. This is because only Swedish [[identity document]]s have been accepted for identity verification. Stolen documents are traceable by banks and some other institutions. The banks have the duty to check the identity of people withdrawing money or getting loans. If a bank gives money to someone using an identity document reported as stolen, the bank must take the loss. Since 2008, any EU passport is valid in Sweden for identity check, and Swedish passports are valid all over the EU. This makes it harder to detect stolen documents, but still banks in Sweden must ensure that stolen documents are not accepted.\n\nOther types of identity theft have become more common in Sweden. One common example is ordering a credit card to someone who has an unlocked letterbox and is not home in the daytime. The thief steals the letter with the credit card and then the letter with the code which typically arrives a few days later. Usage of a stolen credit card is hard in Sweden, since an identity document or a PIN code it is normally demanded. If the shop does not demand that, it must take the loss from stolen credit cards. The method of observing someone using the credit card PIN code, stealing the card or [[skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] it, and then using the card, has become more common.\n\nLegally, Sweden is an open society. [[Freedom of information legislation|The Principle of Public Access]] says that all information kept by public authorities must be available for anyone except in certain cases. Specifically, anyone's address, income, taxes etc. are available to anyone. This makes fraud easier (the address is restricted only for people who needs to hide).\n\nThere was until 2016 no legal ban specifically against using someone's identity, only on the indirect damage caused. To impersonate someone else for financial gain is a kind of [[fraud]], which is described in the [[Criminal Code]] ({{lang-sv|brottsbalken}}). To impersonate someone else to discredit someone by breaking into social media accounts and provoke, is [[libel]], but that is hard to sentence someone for. A new law was introduced late 2016 which partially banned undetermined identity usage.<ref>[http://rkrattsdb.gov.se/SFSdoc/16/160485.PDF SFS 2016:485 Lag om \u00e4ndring i brottsbalken]</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the United Kingdom personal data is protected by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]]. The Act covers all personal data which an organization may hold, including names, birthday and anniversary dates, addresses, telephone numbers, etc.\n\nUnder [[English law]] (which extends to [[Wales]] but not to [[Northern Ireland]] or [[Scotland]]), the [[Deception (criminal law)|deception]] offences under the [[Theft Act 1968]] increasingly contend with identity theft situations. In ''R v Seward'' (2005) EWCA Crim 1941<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2005/1941.html |title=R v Seward (2005) EWCA Crim 1941 }}</ref> the defendant was acting as the \"front man\" in the use of stolen credit cards and other documents to obtain goods. He obtained goods to the value of \u00a310,000 for others who are unlikely ever to be identified.

The statute now makes the possession of any \"means of identification\" to \"knowingly transfer, possess, or use without lawful authority\" a federal crime, alongside unlawful possession of identification documents. However, for federal jurisdiction to prosecute, the crime must include an \"identification document\" that either: (a) is purportedly issued by the United States, (b) is used or intended to defraud the United States, (c) is sent through the mail, or (d) is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce. ''See'' {{usc|18|1028}}(c). Punishment can be up to 5, 15, 20, or 30 years in federal [[prison]], plus fines, depending on the underlying crime per {{usc|18|1028}}(b). In addition, punishments for the unlawful use of a \"means of identification\" were strengthened in \u00a7 1028A (\"Aggravated Identity Theft\"), allowing for a consecutive sentence under specific enumerated felony violations as defined in \u00a7 1028A(c)(1) through (11).<ref>Doyle, Charles.

Identity theft occurs when someone uses another's personally identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or [[credit card number]], without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term ''identity theft'' was coined in 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50111220/50111220se23  |title=Oxford English Dictionary online|date=September 2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 September 2010 }}</ref> Since that time, the definition of identity theft has been statutorily prescribed throughout both the U.K. and the United States as the theft of personally identifiable information, generally including a person's name, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, bank account or credit card numbers, [[PIN number]]s, [[electronic signature]]s, fingerprints, [[password]]s, or any other information that can be used to access a person's financial resources.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Wisconsin Statutes, Sec. 943.201.

Someone can steal or misappropriate personal information without then committing identity theft using the information about every person, such as when a major data breach occurs. A US Government Accountability Office study determined that \"most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07737.pdf |title=Data Breaches Are Frequent, but Evidence of Resulting Identity Theft Is Limited; However, the Full Extent Is Unknown |author= |date= |work=Highlights of GAO-07-737, a report to congressional requesters |publisher=gao.gov |accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref> The report also warned that \"the full extent is unknown\". A later unpublished study by Carnegie Mellon University noted that \"Most often, the causes of identity theft is not known\", but reported that someone else concluded that \"the probability of becoming a victim to identity theft as a result of a data breach is ... around only 2%\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/research/241full.pdf |title=Do Data Breach Disclosure Laws Reduce Identity Theft? |author=Sasha Romanosky |date= |work=Heinz First Research Paper |publisher=heinz.cmu.edu |accessdate=}}</ref> More recently,{{when|date=January 2020}} an association of consumer data companies noted that one of the largest data breaches ever, accounting for over four million records, resulted in only about 1,800 instances of identity theft, according to the company whose systems were breached.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nAn October 2010 article entitled \"Cyber Crime Made Easy\" explained the level to which hackers are using [[malicious software]].<ref name=\"Giles2010\">{{cite journal | last=Giles | first=Jim | title=Cyber crime made easy | journal=New Scientist | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=205 | issue=2752 | year=2010 | issn=0262-4079 | doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(10)60647-1 | pages=20\u201321}}</ref> As Gunter Ollmann,\nChief Technology Officer of security at Microsoft, said, \"Interested in credit card theft?  There's an app for that.\"  This statement summed up the ease with which these hackers are accessing all kinds of information online.  The new program for infecting users' computers was called [[Zeus (malware)|Zeus]]; and the program is so hacker-friendly that even an inexperienced hacker can operate it.  Although the hacking program is easy to use, that fact does not diminish the devastating effects that Zeus (or other software like Zeus) can do to a computer and the user.  For example, the article stated that programs like Zeus can steal credit card information, important documents, and even documents necessary for [[homeland security]].  If the hacker were to gain this information, it would mean identity theft or even a possible terrorist attack. The [[Integrated Threat Assessment Centre|ITAC]] says that about 15 million Americans are having their identity stolen, in 2012.<ref>https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/vit12.pdf</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nSources such as the [[non-profit]] [[Identity Theft Resource Center]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org/ |title=Identity Theft Resource Center website |author= |date= |publisher=idtheftcenter.org |accessdate=  }}</ref> sub-divide identity theft into five categories:\n* Criminal identity theft (posing as another person when apprehended for a crime)\n* Financial identity theft (using another's identity to obtain credit, goods and services)\n* Identity cloning (using another's information to assume his or her identity in daily life)\n* Medical identity theft (using another's identity to obtain medical care or drugs)\n* Child identity theft.\n\nIdentity theft may be used to facilitate or fund other crimes including [[illegal immigration]], [[terrorism]], [[phishing]] and [[espionage]]. There are cases of identity cloning to attack [[payment system]]s, including online credit card processing and [[medical insurance]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/medidtheft_consumertips.html |title=Medical Identity Theft: What to Do if You are a Victim (or are concerned about it) }}, World Privacy Forum</ref>\n\n=== Identity cloning and concealment ===\nIn this situation the identity thief impersonates someone else in order to conceal their own true identity. Examples are [[illegal immigrant]]s hiding their illegal status, people hiding from [[creditor]]s or other individuals, and those who simply want to become \"[[Anonymity|anonymous]]\" for personal reasons. Another example is ''posers'', a label given to people who use someone else's photos and information on social networking sites. Posers mostly create believable stories involving friends of the real person they are imitating. Unlike identity theft used to obtain credit which usually comes to light when the debts mount, concealment may continue indefinitely without being detected, particularly if the identity thief is able to obtain false credentials in order to pass various authentication tests in everyday life.\n\n=== Criminal identity theft ===\nWhen a criminal fraudulently identifies themselves to police as another individual at the point of arrest, it is sometimes referred to as \"Criminal Identity Theft.\" In some cases, criminals have previously obtained state-issued identity documents using credentials stolen from others, or have simply presented a [[fake ID]]. Provided the subterfuge works, charges may be placed under the victim's name, letting the criminal off the hook. Victims might only learn of such incidents by chance, for example by receiving a court summons, discovering their drivers licenses are suspended when stopped for minor traffic violations, or through [[background check]]s performed for employment purposes.\n\nIt can be difficult for the victim of a criminal identity theft to clear their record. The steps required to clear the victim's incorrect [[criminal record]] depend in which jurisdiction the crime occurred and whether the true identity of the criminal can be determined. The victim might need to locate the original arresting officers and prove their own identity by some reliable means such as fingerprinting or DNA testing, and may need to go to a court hearing to be cleared of the charges. Obtaining an [[expungement]] of court records may also be required. Authorities might permanently maintain the victim's name as an alias for the criminal's true identity in their criminal records databases. One problem that victims of criminal identity theft may encounter is that various [[data aggregators]] might still have the incorrect criminal records in their databases even after court and police records are corrected. Thus it is possible that a future background check will return the incorrect criminal records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs17g-CrimIdTheft.htm |title=Privacy Rights Clearinghouse |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120921/http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs17g-CrimIdTheft.htm |archive-date=21 September 2012 |df= }} - \"Fact Sheet 17g: Criminal Identity Theft: What to Do if It Happens to You \"</ref> This is just one example of the kinds of impact that may continue to affect the victims of identity theft for some months or even years after the crime, aside from the psychological trauma that being 'cloned' typically engenders.\n\n=== Synthetic identity theft ===\nA variation of identity theft which has recently become more common is ''synthetic identity theft'', in which identities are completely or partially fabricated.<ref>[http://www.leagle.com/decision/2009567417bbr150_1566 In re Marie A.

Some thieves use social so this what that means\n numbers belonging to people who have been incarcerated for a long period of time, but many begin with a child's social security number that was issued after the year that would make that individual at least 18 years old.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miteksystems.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-identity-fraud|title=What is synthetic identity fraud? {{!}} Mitek|website=www.miteksystems.com|access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref> Synthetic identity theft is more difficult to track as it doesn't show on either person's credit report directly but may appear as an entirely new file in the [[credit bureau]] or as a subfile on one of the victim's credit reports. Synthetic identity theft primarily harms the creditors who unwittingly grant the fraudsters credit. Individual victims can be affected if their names become confused with the synthetic identities, or if negative information in their subfiles impacts their credit ratings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/pf/identity_theft_20070516_a1.asp |title=Detecting synthetic identity fraud |accessdate=21 September 2008 |last=McFadden |first=Leslie |date=16 May 2007 |work=Bankrate.com |pages=1\u20132 |doi=   |quote=  }}</ref>\n\n=== Medical identity theft ===\n{{see also|Medical privacy}}\n[[File:Figure 2- Risk of Identity Theft with Medicare Card under CMS\u2019s Three Proposed Options (7802334168).jpg|thumb|US [[Government Accountability Office]] diagram showing the identity theft risk associated with social security numbers on [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare cards]]]]\n\nPrivacy researcher Pam Dixon, the founder of the World Privacy Forum,<ref>https://www.worldprivacyforum.org/</ref> coined the term medical identity theft and released the first major report about this issue in 2006. In the report, she defined the crime for the first time and made the plight of victims public. The report's definition of the crime is that medical identity theft occurs when someone seeks medical care under the identity of another person. Insurance theft is also very common, if a thief has your insurance information and or your insurance card, they can seek medical attention posing as yourself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.igrad.com/articles/8-types-of-identity-theft|title=Get to Know These Common Types of ID Theft|website=iGrad|access-date=29 September 2016}}</ref>  In addition to risks of financial harm common to all forms of identity theft, the thief's medical history may be added to the victim's [[medical record]]s. Inaccurate information in the victim's records is difficult to correct and may affect future insurability or cause doctors relying on the misinformation to deliver inappropriate care. After the publication of the report, which contained a recommendation that consumers receive notifications of medical data breach incidents, California passed a law requiring this, and then finally HIPAA was expanded to also require medical breach notification when breaches affect 500 or more people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/medicalidentitytheft.html|title=The Medical Identity Theft Information Page|author=|date=|publisher=World Privacy Forum|access-date=26 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130416062351/http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/medicalidentitytheft.html|archive-date=16 April 2013|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org/artman2/publish/v_fact_sheets/Fact_Sheet_130_A_Correcting_Misinformation_on_Medical_Records.shtml |title=Correcting Misinformation on Medical Records |author= |date= |publisher=Identity Theft Resource Center |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123025205/http://www.idtheftcenter.org/artman2/publish/v_fact_sheets/Fact_Sheet_130_A_Correcting_Misinformation_on_Medical_Records.shtml |archive-date=23 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Data collected and stored by hospitals and other organizations such as medical aid schemes is up to 10 times more valuable to cybercriminals than credit card information.\n\n=== Child identity theft ===\nChild identity theft occurs when a minor's identity is used by another person for the impostor's personal gain. The impostor can be a family member, a friend, or even a stranger who targets children. The Social Security numbers of children are valued because they do not have any information associated with them.  Thieves can establish lines of credit, obtain driver's licenses, or even buy a house using a child's identity. This fraud can go undetected for years, as most children do not discover the problem until years later.  Child identity theft is fairly common, and studies have shown that the problem is growing. The largest study on child identity theft, as reported by Richard Power of the [[Carnegie Mellon]] Cylab with data supplied by [[AllClear ID]], found that of 40,000 children, 10.2% were victims of identity theft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/government-turns-spotlight-on-child-id-theft-problem|title=Government Turns Spotlight on Child ID Theft Problem|date=12 January 2016|website=CreditCards.com|language=en-US|access-date=22 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) estimates that about nine million people will be victims of identity theft in the United States per year. It was also estimated that in 2008 630,000 people under the age of 19 were victims of theft. This then gave them a debt of about $12,799 which was not theirs.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A317310399/AONE?u=sunybuff_main&sid=AONE&xid=8502170b.|title=Protecting and defending a young person in foster care from financial identity theft|last=Clemente|first=Jean|date=Feb 2010|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nNot only are children in general big targets of identity theft but children who are in foster care are even bigger targets. This is because they are most likely moved around quite frequently and their SSN is being shared with multiple people and agencies. Foster children are even more victims of identity theft within their own family and other relatives. Young people in foster care who are victims of this crime are usually left alone to struggle and figure out how to fix their newly formed bad credit.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Financial identity theft ===\nThe most common type is financial identity theft, where someone wants to gain economical benefits in someone else's name. This includes getting credits, loans, goods and services, claiming to be someone else.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org/Identity-Theft/what-is-financial-identity-theft.html |title=What is Financial Identity Theft |author= |date= |publisher=ID Theft Center |accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Tax identity theft ===\nOne of the major identity theft categories is tax identity theft. Tax identity theft occurs when someone gains another persons information and uses that to receive a tax refund. The thief in this case can also try to get a job and then their employer will report the income of the real taxpayer, this then results in the taxpayer getting in trouble with the IRS.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.citrincooperman.com/infocus/identity-theft-tax-and-financial-consideration|title=Identity Theft; Tax and Financial Consideration|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe 14039 Form to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] is a form that will help one fight against a theft like tax theft.

Examples include:\n* Rummaging through rubbish for personal information ([[Dumpster diving#Information diving|dumpster diving]])\n* Retrieving personal data from redundant IT equipment and storage media including PCs, servers, PDAs, mobile phones, USB memory sticks and hard drives that have been disposed of carelessly at public dump sites, given away or sold on without having been properly sanitized\n* Using [[public records]] about individual citizens, published in official registers such as electoral rolls<ref>{{cite news | last=Loviglio | first=Joann| url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46874551| title= If Microsoft co-founder's ID isn't safe, is yours? | work= NBC News |date= March 2012 }}</ref>\n* Stealing bank or credit cards, identification cards, passports, authentication tokens ... typically by [[pickpocketing]], [[burglary|housebreaking]] or mail [[theft]]\n* Common-knowledge questioning schemes that offer [[account verification]], such as \"What's your mother's maiden name?\", \"what was your first car model?\", or \"What was your first pet's name?\".\n* [[Skimming (credit card fraud)|Skimming]] information from bank or credit cards using compromised or hand-held card readers, and creating clone cards\n* Using [[Wireless identity theft|'contactless' credit card readers]] to acquire data wirelessly from [[RFID]]-enabled passports\n* Shoulder-Surfing, involves an individual who discreetly watches or hears others providing valuable personal information.

For consumers, this is usually a result of them naively providing their personal information or login credentials to the identity thieves (e.g., in a [[phishing attack]]) but identity-related documents such as credit cards, bank statements, utility bills, checkbooks etc. may also be physically stolen from vehicles, homes, offices, and not the least [[letterboxes]], or directly from victims by pickpockets and bag snatchers. Guardianship of personal identifiers by consumers is the most common intervention strategy recommended by the [[US Federal Trade Commission]], [[PhoneBusters|Canadian Phone Busters]] and most sites that address identity theft. Such organizations offer recommendations on how individuals can prevent their information falling into the wrong hands.\n\nIdentity theft can be partially mitigated by ''not'' identifying oneself unnecessarily (a form of information security control known as risk avoidance). This implies that organizations, IT systems and procedures should not demand excessive amounts of personal information or credentials for identification and authentication. Requiring, storing and processing personal identifiers (such as [[Social Security number]], [[national identification number]], driver's license number, credit card number, etc.) increases the risks of identity theft unless this valuable personal information is adequately secured at all times.  Committing personal identifiers to memory is a sound practice that can reduce the risks of a would-be identity thief from obtaining these records.  To help in remembering numbers such as social security numbers and credit card numbers, it is helpful to consider using mnemonic techniques or memory aids such as the [[Mnemonic major system|mnemonic Major System]].\n\nIdentity thieves sometimes impersonate dead people, using personal information obtained from death notices, gravestones and other sources to exploit delays between the death and the closure of the person's accounts, the inattentiveness of grieving families and weaknesses in the processes for credit-checking. Such crimes may continue for some time until the deceased's families or the authorities notice and react to anomalies.<ref>[http://www.idtheftcenter.org/Fact-Sheets/fs-117.html IDtheftcenter.org<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417074200/http://www.idtheftcenter.org/Fact-Sheets/fs-117.html|date=17 April 2016}}, Identity Theft Resource Center Fact Sheet 117 Identity Theft and the Deceased - Prevention and Victim Tips.</ref>\n\nIn recent years{{When|date=September 2018}}, commercial identity theft protection/insurance services have become available in many countries.

Credit reporting agencies gather and disclose personal and credit information to a wide business client base.\n\nPoor stewardship of personal data by organizations, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data, can expose individuals to the risk of identity theft. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse have documented over 900 individual data breaches by US companies and government agencies since January 2005, which together have involved over 200 million total records containing sensitive personal information, many containing social security numbers.<ref>[http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/ChronDataBreaches.htm A Chronology of Data Breaches<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613183200/http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/ChronDataBreaches.htm|date=13 June 2010}}</ref> Poor corporate diligence standards which can result in data breaches include:\n* failure to shred confidential information before throwing it into dumpsters\n* failure to ensure adequate [[network security]]\n* credit card numbers stolen by [[call center]] agents and people with access to call recordings\n* the theft of laptop computers or portable media being carried off-site containing vast amounts of personal information.

There are people who meet online, get to know each other through the free Facebook chat and exchange of messages that then leads to sharing of private information.  Others get romantically involved with their online friends that they tend to give too much information such as their social security number, bank account and even personal basic information such as home address and company address.\n\nThis phenomenon lead to the creation of Senate Bill 52: Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2010.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/document/59428205/Senate-Bill-52-Cyber-Crime-Prevention-Act Full Text of Senate Bill 52 (Proposing the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2010)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816172609/https://www.scribd.com/document/59428205/Senate-Bill-52-Cyber-Crime-Prevention-Act |date=16 August 2016 }}</ref> Section 2 of this bill states that it recognizes the importance of [[communication]] and [[multimedia]] for the development, exploitation and dissemination of information but violators will be punished by the law through imprisonment or a fine upwards of Php200,000, but not exceeding 1 million, or depending on the damage caused, or both (Section 7).\n\n=== Sweden ===\nSweden has had relatively few problems with identity theft. This is because only Swedish [[identity document]]s have been accepted for identity verification. Stolen documents are traceable by banks and some other institutions. The banks have the duty to check the identity of people withdrawing money or getting loans. If a bank gives money to someone using an identity document reported as stolen, the bank must take the loss. Since 2008, any EU passport is valid in Sweden for identity check, and Swedish passports are valid all over the EU. This makes it harder to detect stolen documents, but still banks in Sweden must ensure that stolen documents are not accepted.\n\nOther types of identity theft have become more common in Sweden. One common example is ordering a credit card to someone who has an unlocked letterbox and is not home in the daytime. The thief steals the letter with the credit card and then the letter with the code which typically arrives a few days later. Usage of a stolen credit card is hard in Sweden, since an identity document or a PIN code it is normally demanded. If the shop does not demand that, it must take the loss from stolen credit cards. The method of observing someone using the credit card PIN code, stealing the card or [[skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] it, and then using the card, has become more common.\n\nLegally, Sweden is an open society. [[Freedom of information legislation|The Principle of Public Access]] says that all information kept by public authorities must be available for anyone except in certain cases. Specifically, anyone's address, income, taxes etc. are available to anyone. This makes fraud easier (the address is restricted only for people who needs to hide).\n\nThere was until 2016 no legal ban specifically against using someone's identity, only on the indirect damage caused. To impersonate someone else for financial gain is a kind of [[fraud]], which is described in the [[Criminal Code]] ({{lang-sv|brottsbalken}}). To impersonate someone else to discredit someone by breaking into social media accounts and provoke, is [[libel]], but that is hard to sentence someone for. A new law was introduced late 2016 which partially banned undetermined identity usage.<ref>[http://rkrattsdb.gov.se/SFSdoc/16/160485.PDF SFS 2016:485 Lag om \u00e4ndring i brottsbalken]</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the United Kingdom personal data is protected by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]]. The Act covers all personal data which an organization may hold, including names, birthday and anniversary dates, addresses, telephone numbers, etc.\n\nUnder [[English law]] (which extends to [[Wales]] but not to [[Northern Ireland]] or [[Scotland]]), the [[Deception (criminal law)|deception]] offences under the [[Theft Act 1968]] increasingly contend with identity theft situations. In ''R v Seward'' (2005) EWCA Crim 1941<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2005/1941.html |title=R v Seward (2005) EWCA Crim 1941 }}</ref> the defendant was acting as the \"front man\" in the use of stolen credit cards and other documents to obtain goods.

The statute now makes the possession of any \"means of identification\" to \"knowingly transfer, possess, or use without lawful authority\" a federal crime, alongside unlawful possession of identification documents. However, for federal jurisdiction to prosecute, the crime must include an \"identification document\" that either: (a) is purportedly issued by the United States, (b) is used or intended to defraud the United States, (c) is sent through the mail, or (d) is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce. ''See'' {{usc|18|1028}}(c). Punishment can be up to 5, 15, 20, or 30 years in federal [[prison]], plus fines, depending on the underlying crime per {{usc|18|1028}}(b). In addition, punishments for the unlawful use of a \"means of identification\" were strengthened in \u00a7 1028A (\"Aggravated Identity Theft\"), allowing for a consecutive sentence under specific enumerated felony violations as defined in \u00a7 1028A(c)(1) through (11).<ref>Doyle, Charles.

Our behaviors are optimised for living in a social group and very often, from the point of view of natural selection, it is useful if we are not consciously aware of our real motivations.\n\nThe book is split into two sections. The first, entitled 'Why We Hide Our Motives' includes an introduction to the subjects of [[animal behaviour]], [[Signalling (economics)|signalling]], [[social norms]] and [[self-deception]].  In the second section, title 'Hidden Motives in Everyday Life' each chapter covers an aspect of human behaviour and describes how it can be explained through the framework of signalling and self-deception outlined in the first section. The chapters in this section cover [[body language]], [[laughter]], [[conversation]], [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], [[art]], [[Charity (practice)|charity]], [[education]], [[medicine]], [[religion]] and [[politics]].\n\n===Body language===\nIn this chapter, the authors explain that body language is largely way of communicating status. Most of us will not consciously describe our body language as doing this, nonetheless, various status-related body positions can be observed in humans, similar to other primates.\n\n===Laughter===\nThe authors argue that laughter is not just a response to humour, but is better ought of as a 'play signal' - an indication that we do not have feelings of hostility towards the other party. A wide range of data is used to support this hypothesis including the fact that people laugh more in groups than on their own, the fact that babies laugh more with their mothers, and the fact that a person who is speaking in general laughs more than a person who is listening.\n\n===Conversation===\nConversation is often thought of as a means of exchanging information. However, most conversations do not involve the exchange of useful information and the structure of conversation is often not optimised for this exchange. The authors argue that this is because the purpose of conversation is instead to show off our mental ability.\n\n===Consumption===\nThe authors discuss [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s theory of [[conspicuous consumption]]. This is the idea that, though we may claim that we buy goods for practical purposes, the main purpose of buying many goods is to signal to others that we can afford to buy them. The authors then point out that many other things, apart from wealth, can be signaled through consumption.\n\n===Art===\nThe authors point out that how much we value art largely depends on extrinsic features of the art such as whether or not it is original and whether it is hand-made or machine-manufactured. This does not make sense if one claims that one cares about art for its direct effects. Art is better thought of as a way for people to show off their erudition and discernment as well as to associate themselves with artists.\n\n===Charity===\nThe authors point out that, while most people claim and feel that they give money to charity because they wish to help a cause, very few people bother to check the cost-effectiveness of the charities which they donate to. The authors argue that this behaviour cannot be explained by the desire to help the cause, but can be explained if donations to charity are viewed as a way of signalling wealth, generosity and compassion.\n\n===Education===\nThis section makes broadly the same argument as [[Bryan Caplan]]'s book [[The Case Against Education]]. Most of us claim that the point of education is to learn the taught material. However, employers often require employees to have a degree, even if the degree is unrelated to the job and most students forget a lot what they have learnt after a few years out of education. The authors argue that the main purpose of education is to show off intelligence, conscientiousness and conformity, as well as achieving secondary purposes, such as allowing people to socialize and allowing the government to indoctrinate its citizens.\n\n===Medicine===\nThe story we tell ourselves about medicine and healthcare is that we use it in order to get better when we are unwell. However, this story does not fit in with many facts about healthcare. For example, regions which spend more on medicine do not tend to be healthier and when people are given access to cheaper healthcare, they do not become healthier (for example in the [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]]). Hanson and Simler argue that this is because medicine and healthcare are largely about signalling compassion, rather than promoting health.\n\n===Religion===\nMost religious people will claim that they are religious because they hold certain beliefs. Hanson and Simler argue that for most of history, religion has been about enacting certain behaviours, rather than specific beliefs. They also point out that religious people (of many conflicting religions) tend to have better [[Religion and health|physical and mental health]] than non-religious people. They suggest that the main purpose of religion is to provide a sense of community and that the rituals and sacrifices that people make for their religions are ways of signalling loyalty.\n\n===Politics===\nOn the face of it, the reason that people participate in politics is to improve the world in some way. However, most of us engage in politics in a way which is emotional, poorly informed relative to the strength of claims that we make and we are generally unwilling to compromise on political issues. These facts are better explained if politics is a way of signalling affiliation to a 'tribe' of like-minded people than as a way of actually trying to improve the world.\n\n==Reception==\nWriting in the [[Wall Street Journal]], Matthew Hutson called the book 'refreshingly frank' and 'penetrating'.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hutson |first1=Matthew |title=The Tangled Web We Weave |journal=Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/review-the-tangled-web-we-weave-1515715136}}</ref>\n\nIn a mostly negative review for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', journalist and novelist [[John Lanchester]] praised the section on education, but criticized the book for 'taking an argument that has worthwhile applications and extending it further than it usefully goes '.

Hanson is an associate professor of [[economics]] at [[George Mason University]] and Simler is a writer and software engineer. The book explores self-deception and hidden motives in human behaviour. The publisher's website describes the aim of the book as 'to track down the darker, unexamined corners of our psyches and blast them with floodlights'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-elephant-in-the-brain-9780190495992?cc=gb&lang=en&#|title=The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life|first1=Kevin|last1=Simler|first2=Robin|last2=Hanson|date=February 8, 2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nThe main thesis of the book is that we are very often not aware of our real reasons for most of our behaviors. Our behaviors are optimised for living in a social group and very often, from the point of view of natural selection, it is useful if we are not consciously aware of our real motivations. \n\nThe book is split into two sections. The first, entitled 'Why We Hide Our Motives' includes an introduction to the subjects of [[animal behaviour]], [[Signalling (economics)|signalling]], [[social norms]] and [[self-deception]].  In the second section, title 'Hidden Motives in Everyday Life' each chapter covers an aspect of human behaviour and describes how it can be explained through the framework of signalling and self-deception outlined in the first section. The chapters in this section cover [[body language]], [[laughter]], [[conversation]], [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], [[art]], [[Charity (practice)|charity]], [[education]], [[medicine]], [[religion]] and [[politics]].\n \n===Body language===\nIn this chapter, the authors explain that body language is largely way of communicating status. Most of us will not consciously describe our body language as doing this, nonetheless, various status-related body positions can be observed in humans, similar to other primates.\n\n===Laughter===\nThe authors argue that laughter is not just a response to humour, but is better ought of as a 'play signal' - an indication that we do not have feelings of hostility towards the other party. A wide range of data is used to support this hypothesis including the fact that people laugh more in groups than on their own, the fact that babies laugh more with their mothers, and the fact that a person who is speaking in general laughs more than a person who is listening.\n\n===Conversation===\nConversation is often thought of as a means of exchanging information. However, most conversations do not involve the exchange of useful information and the structure of conversation is often not optimised for this exchange. The authors argue that this is because the purpose of conversation is instead to show off our mental ability.\n\n===Consumption===\nThe authors discuss [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s theory of [[conspicuous consumption]]. This is the idea that, though we may claim that we buy goods for practical purposes, the main purpose of buying many goods is to signal to others that we can afford to buy them. The authors then point out that many other things, apart from wealth, can be signaled through consumption.\n\n===Art===\nThe authors point out that how much we value art largely depends on extrinsic features of the art such as whether or not it is original and whether it is hand-made or machine-manufactured. This does not make sense if one claims that one cares about art for its direct effects. Art is better thought of as a way for people to show off their erudition and discernment as well as to associate themselves with artists.\n\n===Charity===\nThe authors point out that, while most people claim and feel that they give money to charity because they wish to help a cause, very few people bother to check the cost-effectiveness of the charities which they donate to. The authors argue that this behaviour cannot be explained by the desire to help the cause, but can be explained if donations to charity are viewed as a way of signalling wealth, generosity and compassion.\n\n===Education===\nThis section makes broadly the same argument as [[Bryan Caplan]]'s book [[The Case Against Education]]. Most of us claim that the point of education is to learn the taught material. However, employers often require employees to have a degree, even if the degree is unrelated to the job and most students forget a lot what they have learnt after a few years out of education. The authors argue that the main purpose of education is to show off intelligence, conscientiousness and conformity, as well as achieving secondary purposes, such as allowing people to socialize and allowing the government to indoctrinate its citizens.\n\n===Medicine===\nThe story we tell ourselves about medicine and healthcare is that we use it in order to get better when we are unwell. However, this story does not fit in with many facts about healthcare. For example, regions which spend more on medicine do not tend to be healthier and when people are given access to cheaper healthcare, they do not become healthier (for example in the [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]]). Hanson and Simler argue that this is because medicine and healthcare are largely about signalling compassion, rather than promoting health.\n\n===Religion===\nMost religious people will claim that they are religious because they hold certain beliefs.

Therefore, a [[Great Coalition]] of parties formed in order to reform the political system.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=44}}\n\n===Influences leading to Confederation===\nSeveral factors influenced Confederation, both caused from internal sources and pressures from external sources.{{sfn|Martin|1995|pp=23-57}}<ref name=\"Martin1990\">{{cite book |first=Ged |last=Martin |title=The Causes of Canadian confederation |pages=[https://archive.org/details/causesofcanadian0000unse/page/12 12\u201324] |year=1990 |publisher=Acadiensis Press |isbn=978-0-919107-25-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/causesofcanadian0000unse/page/12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Smith |title=British Businessmen and Canadian Confederation Constitution-Making in an Era of Anglo-Globalization |location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=2008}}</ref>\n;Internal causes that influenced Confederation:\n* political deadlock resulting from the current political structure\n* demographic pressure (population expansion)\n* economic nationalism and the promise of economic development\n* an inter-colony railroad which would improve trade, military movement, and transportation in general <ref>The Intercolonial Railway, ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' http://biographi.ca/en/theme_conferences_1864.html?p=4</ref>\n\n;External pressures that influenced Confederation:\n* cancellation of the [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] (a free trade policy whereby products were allowed into the United States without taxes or tariffs starting in 1854, which was then considered to be beneficial for Canada), in 1865 by the United States, partly as a revenge against Great Britain for unofficial support of the South in the American Civil War\n* the U.S. doctrine of \"[[manifest destiny]]\", the possible threat of invasion from the U.S.\u2014Canadians had fended off American invasions during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812\u2014increased by the [[Alaska Purchase]] of March 30, 1867, which was supported on the floor of the U.S. Senate (by Charles Sumner, among others) precisely in terms of taking over the remainder of North America from the British\n* the [[American Civil War]], which horrified Canadians and drove many away from any thought of republicanism, along with British actions during the war, and American reactions to Canada<ref>The American Dimension, ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', http://biographi.ca/en/theme_conferences_1864.html?p=3</ref>\n* the [[Fenian raids]]\n* the [[Little Englander]] philosophy, whereby Britain no longer wanted to maintain troops in its colonies.\n* political pressure from British financiers who had invested money in the loss-making [[Grand Trunk Railway]]\n* The [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]\n\n===Ideological origins and philosophical dimensions===\n[[File:Map of the Eastern British Provinces in North America at the time of Confederation 1867.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Eastern British Provinces in North America at the time of Canadian Confederation, 1867.]]\nThere is extensive scholarly debate on the role of political ideas in Canadian Confederation. Traditionally, historians regarded Canadian Confederation an exercise in political pragmatism that was essentially non-ideological. In the 1960s, historian [[Peter Busby Waite|Peter Waite]] derided the references to political philosophers in the legislative debates on Confederation as \"hot air\". In Waite's view, Confederation was driven by pragmatic brokerage politics and competing interest groups.<ref>See Introduction by Ged Martin in Peter B. Waite, ''The Confederation Debates in the Province of Canada, 1865 A Selection'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1987, political scientist Peter&nbsp;J. Smith challenged the view Canadian Confederation was non-ideological. Smith argued Confederation was motivated by new political ideologies as much as the American and French Revolutions and Canadian Confederation was driven by a [[Court Party]] ideology. Smith traces the origins of this ideology to eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain, where political life was polarized between defenders of [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] values of the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] and proponents of a new pro-capitalist ideology of the Court Party, which believed in centralizing political power. In British North America in the late 1860s, the Court Party tradition was represented by the supporters of Confederation, whereas the anti-capitalist and agrarian Country Party tradition was embodied by the Anti-Confederates.<ref>Smith, Peter J. 1987. \"The Ideological Origins of Canadian Confederation\". Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue Canadienne De Science Politique. 20, no. 1: 3\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn a 2000 journal article, historian [[Ian McKay (historian)|Ian McKay]] argued Canadian Confederation was motivated by the ideology of liberalism and the belief in the supremacy of individual rights. McKay described Confederation as part of the classical liberal project of creating a \"liberal order\" in northern North America.<ref>Mckay, I. 2000. \"The Liberal Order Framework: A Prospectus for a Reconnaissance of Canadian History\". CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW. 81: 617\u2013645.</ref> Many Canadian historians have adopted McKay's liberal order framework as a paradigm for understanding Canadian history.<ref>Ducharme, Michel, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Constant. ''Liberalism and Hegemony: Debating the Canadian Liberal Revolution''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2008, historian Andrew Smith advanced a very different view of Confederation's ideological origins. He argues that in the four original Canadian provinces, the politics of taxation were a central issue in the debate about Confederation. Taxation was also central to the debate in Newfoundland, the tax-averse colony that rejected it. Smith argued Confederation was supported by many colonists who were sympathetic to a relatively interventionist, or statist, approach to capitalist development. Most classical liberals, who believed in free trade and low taxes, opposed Confederation because they feared it would result in Big Government. The struggle over Confederation involved a battle between a staunchly individualist economic philosophy and a comparatively collectivist view of the state's proper role in the economy. According to Smith, the victory of the [[Statism|statist]] supporters of Confederation over their [[anti-statist]] opponents prepared the way for Sir John A. Macdonald's government to enact the protectionist National Policy and to subsidize major infrastructure projects such as the [[Intercolonial Railway|Intercolonial]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Pacific]] Railways.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2008. \"Toryism, Classical Liberalism, and Capitalism: The Politics of Taxation and the Struggle for Canadian Confederation\". ''The Canadian Historical Review''. 89, no. 1: 1\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, political scientist [[Janet Ajzenstat]] connected Canadian Confederation to the individualist ideology of [[John Locke]]. She argued that the union of the British North American colonies was motivated by a desire to protect individual rights, especially the rights to life, liberty, and property. She contends the Fathers of Confederation were motivated by the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She argues their intellectual debts to Locke are most evident when one looks at the 1865 debates in the Province of Canada's legislature on whether or not union with the other British North American colonies would be desirable.<ref>Ajzenstat, Janet.

Macdonald]] surprised the Atlantic premiers by asking if the Province of Canada could be included in the negotiations. The request was channelled through the Governor-General, Monck, to London and accepted by the Colonial Office.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008}} After several years of legislative paralysis in the Province of Canada caused by the need to maintain a double legislative majority (a majority of both the Canada East and Canada West delegates in the Province of Canada's legislature), Macdonald had led his [[Liberal-Conservative Party]] into the [[Great Coalition]] with [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]]'s [[Parti bleu]] and [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]]'s [[Clear Grits]].{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}} Macdonald, Cartier, and Brown felt union with the other British colonies might be a way to solve the political problems of the Province of Canada.{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}}\n\nThe [[Charlottetown Conference]] began on September 1, 1864. Since the agenda for the meeting had already been set, the delegation from the Province of Canada was initially not an official part of the Conference. The issue of Maritime Union was deferred and the Canadians were formally allowed to join and address the Conference.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=83}}\n\nNo minutes from the Charlottetown Conference survive, but we do know George-\u00c9tienne Cartier and John A. Macdonald presented arguments in favour of a union of the three colonies;{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=304}} [[Alexander Tilloch Galt]] presented the Province of Canada's proposals on the financial arrangements of such a union;{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=304}} and George Brown presented a proposal for what form a united government might take.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=87}} The Canadian delegation's proposal for the governmental system involved:\n# preservation of ties with Great Britain;\n# residual jurisdiction left to a central authority;\n# a bicameral system including a Lower House with representation by population (rep by pop) and an Upper House with representation based on regional, rather than provincial, equality;\n# responsible government at the federal and provincial levels;\n# the appointment of a [[Governor General of Canada|Canadian governor general]] by the [[British Crown]].\n\nOther proposals attractive to the politicians from the Maritime colonies were:\n# assumption of provincial debt by the central government;{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=85}}\n# revenues from the central government apportioned to the provinces on the basis of population;{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=85}}\n# the building of an intercolonial railway to link Montreal and Halifax, giving Canada access to an ice-free winter port and the Maritimes easy access to Canada and [[Rupert's Land]].{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=307}}\n\nBy September 7, 1864, the delegates from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island gave a positive answer to the Canadian delegation, expressing the view the federation of all of the provinces was considered desirable if the terms of union could be made satisfactory{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}} and the question of Maritime Union was waived.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=87}}\n\nAfter the Conference adjourned on September 9, there were further meetings between delegates held at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], and [[Fredericton]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=88}}{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}} These meetings evinced enough interest that the delegates decided to hold a second Conference.\n[[File:ThomasDArcyMcGee.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas D'Arcy McGee in 1868]]\n\n====Delegates' reactions====\nOne of the most important purposes of the Charlottetown Conference was the introduction of Canadians to the leaders from the Maritime Provinces and vice versa. At this point, there was no railway link from Quebec City to Halifax, and the people of each region had little to do with one another. [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] was one of the few Canadian delegates who had been to the Maritimes, when he had gone down earlier that summer with a trade mission of Canadian businessmen, journalists and politicians.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}}\n\nGeorge Brown remarked in a letter to his wife Anne that at a party given by the premier of PEI, Colonel [[John Hamilton Gray (Prince Edward Island politician)|John Hamilton Gray]], he met a woman who had never been off the island in her entire life. Nevertheless, he found [[Prince Edward Island]]ers to be \"amazingly civilized\".{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\nReaction to the Charlottetown Conference varied among the different newspapers. In the Maritimes, there was concern that the smooth Canadians with their sparkling champagne and charming speeches were outsmarting the delegates of the smaller provinces. \"From all accounts it looks as if these [Canadian] gentlemen had it all their own way; ... and that, what with their arguments and what with their blandishments, (they gave a champagne lunch on board the ''Victoria'' where Mr. McGee's wit sparkled brightly as the wine), they carried the Lower Province delegates a little off their feet.\"<ref>Fredericton ''Head Quarters'', of September 14, 1864, cited in Waite, p. 90</ref>\n\n===Quebec Conference===\n{{Main|Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Resolutions}}\nAfter returning home from the Charlottetown Conference, John A. Macdonald asked [[Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck|Viscount Monck]], the [[Governor-General of the Province of Canada]] to invite delegates from the three Maritime provinces and Newfoundland to a conference with United Canada delegates. Monck obliged and the Conference went ahead at [[Quebec City]] in October 1864.\n\n[[File:QuebecConvention1864.jpg|thumb|left|Delegates at the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]], October 1864]]\n\nThe Conference began on October 10, 1864, on the site of present-day Montmorency Park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/histoires-stories/parc-montmorency-park-eng.cfm |title=Quebec 2008 (400th Anniversary website), Government of Canada |publisher=Quebec400.gc.ca |date=November 8, 2007 |accessdate=May 8, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506011800/http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/histoires-stories/parc-montmorency-park-eng.cfm |archivedate=May 6, 2012}}</ref> The Conference elected [[\u00c9tienne-Paschal Tach\u00e9]] as its chairman, but it was dominated by Macdonald. Despite differences in the positions of some of the delegates on some issues, the Quebec Conference, following so swiftly on the success of the Charlottetown Conference, was infused with a determinative sense of purpose and [[nationalism]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=98}} For the Reformers of Canada West, led by George Brown, the end of what they perceived as French-Canadian interference in local affairs was in sight.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}} For Maritimers such as Tupper of Nova Scotia or Tilley of New Brunswick, horizons were suddenly broadened to take in much larger possibilities for trade and growth.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}}\n\nOn the issue of the Senate, the Maritime Provinces pressed for as much equality as possible. With the addition of Newfoundland to the Conference, the other three Maritime colonies did not wish to see the strength of their provinces in the upper chamber diluted by simply adding Newfoundland to the Atlantic category.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=100}} It was the matter of the Senate that threatened to derail the entire proceedings.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}} It was Macdonald who came up with the acceptable compromise of giving Newfoundland four senators of its own when it joined.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}}\n\nThe delegates from the Maritimes also raised an issue with respect to the level of government\u2014federal or provincial\u2014that would be given the powers not otherwise specifically defined. Macdonald, who was aiming for the strongest central government possible, insisted this was to be the central government, and in this, he was supported by, among others, Tupper.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=105}}\n\nAt the end of the Conference, it adopted the [[Seventy-two Resolutions]] which would form the basis of a scheduled future conference. The Conference adjourned on October 27.\n\nPrince Edward Island emerged disappointed from the Quebec Conference. It did not receive support for a guarantee of six members in the proposed House of Commons, and was denied an appropriation of $200,000 it felt had been offered at Charlottetown to assist in [[Land Purchase Act (1875)|buying out the holdings of absentee landlords]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=107}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\n\"Never was there such an opportunity as now for the birth of a nation\" proclaimed a pamphlet written by S. E. Dawson and reprinted in a Quebec City newspaper during the Conference.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}}\n\nAgain, reaction to the Quebec Conference varied depending on the political views of the critic.\n\n==== Constitutional scheme discussed in London====\nGeorge Brown was the first to carry the constitutional proposals to the British Government in London in December 1864, where it gave \"a most gracious answer to our constitutional scheme.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mackenzie |first=Alexander |title=The Life and Speeches of Hon.

The union proved more controversial in the Maritime provinces, however, and it was not until 1866 that New Brunswick and Nova Scotia passed union resolutions, while Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland continued to opt against joining.\n\nIn December 1866, sixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia travelled to London, where the [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|4th Earl of Carnarvon]] presented each to [[Queen Victoria]] in private [[audience (meeting)|audience]],<ref name=\"Lady Carnarvon\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.ladycarnarvon.com/a-constitutional-walk-for-canada-day/ |title=A Constitutional Walk for Canada Day |date=2017-06-30 |work=Lady Carnarvon |access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref> as well as holding court for their wives and daughters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bousfield|1991|p=16}}</ref> At meetings held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, the delegates reviewed and approved the 72 resolutions; although Charles Tupper had promised anti-union forces in Nova Scotia he would push for amendments, he was unsuccessful in getting any passed. Now known as the ''London Resolutions'', the conference's decisions were forwarded to the [[Colonial Office]].\n\nAfter breaking for Christmas, the delegates reconvened in January 1867 and began drafting the ''[[British North America Act (1867)|British North America Act]].'' The 4th Earl of Carnarvon continued to have a central role in drafting the act at [[Highclere Castle]] alongside the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[John A.

July 1 is now celebrated as a [[public holiday]], [[Canada Day]], the country's official [[National Day]].\n\nThe form of the country's government was influenced by the American republic to the south. Noting the flaws perceived in the American system, the Fathers of Confederation opted to retain a monarchical form of government. [[John A.

Traditionally, historians regarded Canadian Confederation an exercise in political pragmatism that was essentially non-ideological. In the 1960s, historian [[Peter Busby Waite|Peter Waite]] derided the references to political philosophers in the legislative debates on Confederation as \"hot air\". In Waite's view, Confederation was driven by pragmatic brokerage politics and competing interest groups.<ref>See Introduction by Ged Martin in Peter B. Waite, ''The Confederation Debates in the Province of Canada, 1865 A Selection'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1987, political scientist Peter&nbsp;J. Smith challenged the view Canadian Confederation was non-ideological. Smith argued Confederation was motivated by new political ideologies as much as the American and French Revolutions and Canadian Confederation was driven by a [[Court Party]] ideology. Smith traces the origins of this ideology to eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain, where political life was polarized between defenders of [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] values of the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] and proponents of a new pro-capitalist ideology of the Court Party, which believed in centralizing political power. In British North America in the late 1860s, the Court Party tradition was represented by the supporters of Confederation, whereas the anti-capitalist and agrarian Country Party tradition was embodied by the Anti-Confederates.<ref>Smith, Peter J. 1987. \"The Ideological Origins of Canadian Confederation\". Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue Canadienne De Science Politique. 20, no. 1: 3\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn a 2000 journal article, historian [[Ian McKay (historian)|Ian McKay]] argued Canadian Confederation was motivated by the ideology of liberalism and the belief in the supremacy of individual rights. McKay described Confederation as part of the classical liberal project of creating a \"liberal order\" in northern North America.<ref>Mckay, I. 2000. \"The Liberal Order Framework: A Prospectus for a Reconnaissance of Canadian History\". CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW. 81: 617\u2013645.</ref> Many Canadian historians have adopted McKay's liberal order framework as a paradigm for understanding Canadian history.<ref>Ducharme, Michel, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Constant. ''Liberalism and Hegemony: Debating the Canadian Liberal Revolution''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2008, historian Andrew Smith advanced a very different view of Confederation's ideological origins. He argues that in the four original Canadian provinces, the politics of taxation were a central issue in the debate about Confederation. Taxation was also central to the debate in Newfoundland, the tax-averse colony that rejected it. Smith argued Confederation was supported by many colonists who were sympathetic to a relatively interventionist, or statist, approach to capitalist development. Most classical liberals, who believed in free trade and low taxes, opposed Confederation because they feared it would result in Big Government. The struggle over Confederation involved a battle between a staunchly individualist economic philosophy and a comparatively collectivist view of the state's proper role in the economy. According to Smith, the victory of the [[Statism|statist]] supporters of Confederation over their [[anti-statist]] opponents prepared the way for Sir John A. Macdonald's government to enact the protectionist National Policy and to subsidize major infrastructure projects such as the [[Intercolonial Railway|Intercolonial]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Pacific]] Railways.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2008. \"Toryism, Classical Liberalism, and Capitalism: The Politics of Taxation and the Struggle for Canadian Confederation\". ''The Canadian Historical Review''. 89, no. 1: 1\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, political scientist [[Janet Ajzenstat]] connected Canadian Confederation to the individualist ideology of [[John Locke]]. She argued that the union of the British North American colonies was motivated by a desire to protect individual rights, especially the rights to life, liberty, and property. She contends the Fathers of Confederation were motivated by the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She argues their intellectual debts to Locke are most evident when one looks at the 1865 debates in the Province of Canada's legislature on whether or not union with the other British North American colonies would be desirable.<ref>Ajzenstat, Janet.

The request was channelled through the Governor-General, Monck, to London and accepted by the Colonial Office.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008}} After several years of legislative paralysis in the Province of Canada caused by the need to maintain a double legislative majority (a majority of both the Canada East and Canada West delegates in the Province of Canada's legislature), Macdonald had led his [[Liberal-Conservative Party]] into the [[Great Coalition]] with [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]]'s [[Parti bleu]] and [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]]'s [[Clear Grits]].{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}} Macdonald, Cartier, and Brown felt union with the other British colonies might be a way to solve the political problems of the Province of Canada.{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}}\n\nThe [[Charlottetown Conference]] began on September 1, 1864. Since the agenda for the meeting had already been set, the delegation from the Province of Canada was initially not an official part of the Conference. The issue of Maritime Union was deferred and the Canadians were formally allowed to join and address the Conference.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=83}}\n\nNo minutes from the Charlottetown Conference survive, but we do know George-\u00c9tienne Cartier and John A.

At this point, there was no railway link from Quebec City to Halifax, and the people of each region had little to do with one another. [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] was one of the few Canadian delegates who had been to the Maritimes, when he had gone down earlier that summer with a trade mission of Canadian businessmen, journalists and politicians.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}}\n\nGeorge Brown remarked in a letter to his wife Anne that at a party given by the premier of PEI, Colonel [[John Hamilton Gray (Prince Edward Island politician)|John Hamilton Gray]], he met a woman who had never been off the island in her entire life. Nevertheless, he found [[Prince Edward Island]]ers to be \"amazingly civilized\".{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\nReaction to the Charlottetown Conference varied among the different newspapers. In the Maritimes, there was concern that the smooth Canadians with their sparkling champagne and charming speeches were outsmarting the delegates of the smaller provinces. \"From all accounts it looks as if these [Canadian] gentlemen had it all their own way; ... and that, what with their arguments and what with their blandishments, (they gave a champagne lunch on board the ''Victoria'' where Mr. McGee's wit sparkled brightly as the wine), they carried the Lower Province delegates a little off their feet.\"<ref>Fredericton ''Head Quarters'', of September 14, 1864, cited in Waite, p. 90</ref>\n\n===Quebec Conference===\n{{Main|Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Resolutions}}\nAfter returning home from the Charlottetown Conference, John A.

Despite differences in the positions of some of the delegates on some issues, the Quebec Conference, following so swiftly on the success of the Charlottetown Conference, was infused with a determinative sense of purpose and [[nationalism]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=98}} For the Reformers of Canada West, led by George Brown, the end of what they perceived as French-Canadian interference in local affairs was in sight.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}} For Maritimers such as Tupper of Nova Scotia or Tilley of New Brunswick, horizons were suddenly broadened to take in much larger possibilities for trade and growth.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}}\n\nOn the issue of the Senate, the Maritime Provinces pressed for as much equality as possible. With the addition of Newfoundland to the Conference, the other three Maritime colonies did not wish to see the strength of their provinces in the upper chamber diluted by simply adding Newfoundland to the Atlantic category.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=100}} It was the matter of the Senate that threatened to derail the entire proceedings.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}} It was Macdonald who came up with the acceptable compromise of giving Newfoundland four senators of its own when it joined.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}}\n\nThe delegates from the Maritimes also raised an issue with respect to the level of government\u2014federal or provincial\u2014that would be given the powers not otherwise specifically defined. Macdonald, who was aiming for the strongest central government possible, insisted this was to be the central government, and in this, he was supported by, among others, Tupper.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=105}}\n\nAt the end of the Conference, it adopted the [[Seventy-two Resolutions]] which would form the basis of a scheduled future conference. The Conference adjourned on October 27.\n\nPrince Edward Island emerged disappointed from the Quebec Conference. It did not receive support for a guarantee of six members in the proposed House of Commons, and was denied an appropriation of $200,000 it felt had been offered at Charlottetown to assist in [[Land Purchase Act (1875)|buying out the holdings of absentee landlords]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=107}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\n\"Never was there such an opportunity as now for the birth of a nation\" proclaimed a pamphlet written by S.

The union proved more controversial in the Maritime provinces, however, and it was not until 1866 that New Brunswick and Nova Scotia passed union resolutions, while Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland continued to opt against joining.\n\nIn December 1866, sixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia travelled to London, where the [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|4th Earl of Carnarvon]] presented each to [[Queen Victoria]] in private [[audience (meeting)|audience]],<ref name=\"Lady Carnarvon\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.ladycarnarvon.com/a-constitutional-walk-for-canada-day/ |title=A Constitutional Walk for Canada Day |date=2017-06-30 |work=Lady Carnarvon |access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref> as well as holding court for their wives and daughters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bousfield|1991|p=16}}</ref> At meetings held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, the delegates reviewed and approved the 72 resolutions; although Charles Tupper had promised anti-union forces in Nova Scotia he would push for amendments, he was unsuccessful in getting any passed. Now known as the ''London Resolutions'', the conference's decisions were forwarded to the [[Colonial Office]].\n\nAfter breaking for Christmas, the delegates reconvened in January 1867 and began drafting the ''[[British North America Act (1867)|British North America Act]].'' The 4th Earl of Carnarvon continued to have a central role in drafting the act at [[Highclere Castle]] alongside the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[John A.

Separate provinces were re-established under their current names of Ontario and Quebec. July 1 is now celebrated as a [[public holiday]], [[Canada Day]], the country's official [[National Day]].\n\nThe form of the country's government was influenced by the American republic to the south. Noting the flaws perceived in the American system, the Fathers of Confederation opted to retain a monarchical form of government. [[John A. Macdonald]], speaking in 1865 about the proposals for the upcoming Confederation of Canada, said:\n\n{{quote|By adhering to the monarchical principle we avoid one defect inherent in the [[Constitution of the United States]].

He is never looked up to by the whole people as the head and front of the nation. He is at best but the successful leader of a party. This defect is all the greater on account of the practice of reelection.

According to the Supreme Court of Canada, Canadian \"sovereignty was acquired in the period between its separate signature of the ''Treaty of Versailles'' in 1919 and the ''Statute of Westminster, 1931''\" long after Confederation in 1867.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/4737/index.do |title=Reference Re: Offshore Mineral Rights |year=1967 |publisher=[[Supreme Court of Canada]] |location=Ottawa |page=816}}</ref> Defence of British North America became a Canadian responsibility.<ref name=\"Dyck2011b\">{{cite book |first=Rand |last=Dyck |title=Canadian Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUOoN8e5Ps0C&pg=PA106 |date=March 2011 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-17-650343-7 |page=106}}</ref> Foreign policy remained in British hands, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] remained Canada's highest court of appeal, and the constitution could be amended only in Britain.

Examples include [[Mount Confederation]], [[Confederation Square]], [[Confederation Building (disambiguation)|Confederation Building]], [[Confederation Park (disambiguation)|Confederation Park]], [[Confederation Station (OC Transpo)|Confederation Station]], [[Confederation Heights]], [[Confederation Bridge]], and so on.

One result of this was the ''[[Indian Act]]'' of 1873, which has governed relations ever since. Canada was no longer a colony of the United Kingdom, but Canadian Confederation continued the conditions of colonialism, including resource grabbing, broken treaties, forced assimilation, culture loss, ecological destruction, heteropatriarchy, and intergenerational trauma inflicted by the hegemony of the Canadian state on indigenous nations that had been self-governing and ecologically sound.<ref>{{cite web |first=Moira |last=Macdonald |url=https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/six-indigenous-scholars-share-views-canada-150/ |title=Six Indigenous scholars share their view of Canada at 150 |work=University Affairs |date=June 7, 2017 |access-date=September 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Gabrielle |last=Slowey |url=http://activehistory.ca/2016/07/19457/ |title=Confederation comes at a cost: Indigenous peoples and the ongoing reality of colonialism in Canada |work=Active History |date=July 8, 2016 |access-date=September 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Dakshana |last=Bascaramurty |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canada-150/canada-day-indigenous-perspectives-on-canada-150/article35498737/ |title='A horrible history': Four Indigenous views on Canada 150 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=June 30, 2017 |access-date=September 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0306396813497877 |title=Neoliberal settler colonialism, Canada and the tar sands |journal=Race & Class |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=42\u201359 |year=2013 |last1=Preston |first1=Jen}}</ref> As the 20th century progressed, attention to the conditions of Canada's Indigenous peoples increased, which included the granting of full citizenship and voting rights to Indigenous Canadians.{{Cn|date=November 2019}} Treaty rights were enshrined in the Canadian Constitution in 1982.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} A process of land claims settlements is ongoing.{{Cn|date=November 2019}} A Truth and Reconciliation Commission was struck to identify further measures to improve conditions.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Expo 67]]\n* [[150th anniversary of Canada]]\n* [[History of Canada]]\n* [[Territorial evolution of Canada]]\n* [[List of documents from the constitutional history of Canada]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Bousfield |first=Arthur |first2=Garry |last2=Toffoli |title=Royal Observations |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd. |year=1991 |location=Toronto |url=https://archive.org/details/royalobservation0000bous |url-access=registration |quote=toffoli. |isbn=978-1-55002-076-2 |accessdate=March 7, 2010 |ref=CITEREFBousfield1991}}\n* {{cite book |first=J.

C. Alder was elected Fire chief for the city of Tulsa. In 1901, The Fire Department received their first alarm and responded and deployed hoses and water more effectively than ever before. The city council decided to pay for a chemical truck and start paying them for their response. The Chemical truck was named \"Old Soda Fountain\" and saved multiple buildings while in service. In early 1905 Chief Alder was sent to [[Kansas City]], [[Missouri]] to choose some new recruits and a horse team, this started the first paid Fire Department.\n\n=== R. C. Alder (1900\u201322) ===\nWhen the Electric call boxes started appearing around Tulsa it allowed the Tulsa Fire Department to respond more efficiently and frequently to calls. In February 1906, the Tulsa Fire Department was called the most perfect Department in the country. The head of the rating bureau, Mr. Ingalls said if all the Fire Departments in America followed off of Tulsa the number of fire losses would be decreased by 50% nationwide. On March 19, 1906, The Electrical inspector and Chief Alder Activated alarm box #39 at 5th & Cheyenne and even though it was supper relief time 2 men responded in 1 minute and 20 seconds. The Tulsa Fire Department would receive their 1st motorized vehicle in 1907 and when chief Alder requested another motorized vehicle the request was denied because they thought that horse-drawn wagons could never be replaced. In 1908 the Tulsa Fire Department received their 1st aerial ladder truck, a horse team, and a 75-foot aerial ladder for $5,000. By October 1, 1913, everything in Tulsa Fire Department was motorized. The Tulsa Fire Department was the first Fire department west of the [[Mississippi River]] to be completely motorized. On October 24, 1917, two firefighters, Ross Shepard and Ben Hanes were killed while fighting a fire at the [[Mayo Building (Tulsa, Oklahoma)]] from falling through a stairwell. In 1919 the men had 84 hour work weeks divided into two shifts.\n\n=== Wesley Bush (1922\u201326) ===\nWhile chief Wesley Bush was chief, Tulsa Fire Department received 3 new [[Seagrave Fire Apparatus]] pumper trucks in 1924. The department had 13 companies and 122 men on the payroll in 1924. On July 1, 1926, the end of the [[fiscal year]] showed that the Tulsa Fire Department had responded to 1,091 alarms. Later that year Bush stepped down from his position as fire chief.\n\n=== R. E. Pitts (1926\u201333) ===\nThe [[National Board of Fire Underwriters]] rated Tulsa Fire Department one of the best in the nation in 1927. The Department ranked among the best despite being undermanned and inadequately equipped. On April 3, 1928, the firemen submitted a \"petition NO. 2\" to raise the salary from $0.42 an hour to $0.56 per hour. In 1931 each man signed a contract saying they would pay the survivors of an active firefighter in the event they died on or off the job. In 1931 the Fire Department had 161 men, 12 pump trucks, 4 ladders, and 3 hose carts. Chief R. E. Pitts retired on June 28, 1933.\n\n=== R. W. Granger (1933\u201340) ===\nGranger started his career with the company on June 1, 1933 as fire chief.  \"In December\nof 1935, Chief Granger made up a Drill Evolution Instruction Guide for governing Company\nEvolutions. It consisted of \"Order No. l,\" which spelled out how the Drill Evolutions would be carried out, and \"Evolution No. l,\" which was to lay a line into the Drill Tower and charge it\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoftulsa.org/media/3311/tfdhistory2-2017.pdf|title=History of Tulsa Fire Department}}{{fix|text=author?|link=WP:SPS}}</ref> Granger enjoyed a \"good\" 7 years before being replaced by Fire Chief C.C. Jennings, whom would serve for 10 years.\n\n=== C. C. Jennings (1940\u201350) ===\nIn 1940 the Fire Department received 2 1939 Ford sedans for the district chiefs. In 1941 Captain J.C. Warf was thrown from an open cab Seagrave pumper truck during a collision at pine & Rockford. Captain Warf died at the age of 51 the next day at Hillcrest medical center. In 1943, each Tulsa fire truck would receive a 2 way mobile radio. In 1945 the Tulsa Fire Department got their own radio station and would be the most well equipped Fire Department in the Midwest. In 1949 Fire Station #16 was opened and equipped with a 1949 500 gallon American La France Pumper. After 30 years of service, Chief Jennings retired from the department, he had been Chief for 10 years. \n\n=== G. N. Paris (1950\u201356) ===\nChief Paris was the Department's sixth Fire Chief and would remain in this position for 6 years. On January 29, 1955, the Department changed to a schedule of 24 hours on 48 off. On May 15, 1956, Chief Paris retired after 27 years with the department, his time as Chief was relatively uneventful.\n\n=== Galaird Sartain (1956\u201364) ===\nGalaird was put in as chief after Paris had retired two days prior to his inauguration as chief. \"On October 6, 1956, fire destroyed the downtown Safeway Store. The loss was estimated to be at $500,000. The fire broke through the roof, imperiling some thirty homes in the area\". this was a pivotal moment in the beginning of his career as chief. In 1958, 4 new Fire Stations were built and put in the city that year. \"In 1961, the Tulsa Fire Department received the highest honor ever afforded a Fire Department in Oklahoma\". The Tulsa Fire Department was chosen by the [[National Fire Protection Association]] to be included in a training video \"Fighting Tank Fires\". In 1964, Chief Sartain retired on July 1st after about 8 years with the force. He was preceded by E. S. Hawkins<ref>https://www.cityoftulsa.org/media/3311/tfdhistory2-2017.pdf</ref>.\n\n=== E. S. Hawkins (1964\u201385) ===\nAt the beginning of his time as Chief, the Tulsa Fire Department was said to have been worth around $1,117,225. In 1965 the Tulsa Fire Department purchased a aircraft accident truck and station it at [[Tulsa International Airport]] as Unit 51. In 1965 a fire at the London Square apartments claimed the lives of a mother and her 3 kids. The fire brought attention to the fact that fire walls weren't being built in multi-dwelling buildings such as the London Square Apartments. A year later in 1966 another fire broke out in the London Square Apartments but the fire was under control quickly and was put out efficiently. The Tulsa Fire Department said it was because a Fire Wall was built. In 1965 Tulsa Fire Department started installing the micro wave teletype which would replace underground cables.\n\nOn November 22, 1967, R.C. Alder (first fire chief of Tulsa) made his last run at the age of 90 after his death: his flag covered casket was taken to Rose Hill Park on Engine #4. In 1968 Tulsa firefighters voted to raise the retirement fund to $3,500. Firefighters were required to use full protective clothing and use the [[SCBA]] in 1978. T.R. Coatney suffered a heart attack and died at station 11 on June 29, 1978, his death was considered a Line of Duty Death. Tulsa Fire Department created a 4 minute response time standard for EMS calls in 1981. In 1982, members of the Tulsa Fire Department were called to crutchfield park to fill a small pool with water for the filming of [[The Outsiders (film)]]. The Fire Department also helped wet down streets for night filming. In 1982 Dwight Wilson of Station 19 was awarded the [[Certificate of Merit]] by the [[American Red Cross]] for resuscitating a 15 year old boy who was exposed to smoke. Chief Hawkins retired in 1985 after 21 years as Chief.\n\n=== T. L. Baker (1985\u20132002) ===\nChief Baker's time as Chief was relatively uneventful until April 19, 1995 when an explosion at the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma City]] killed 168 people. Multiple rescue crews responded from Tulsa and around the country, this would later be known as the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], and it would be the most deadly terrorist attack in America until the [[September 11 attack]]. The budget for Tulsa Fire Department in 1996 was $40.2 million. W.D. Meyers suffered a Heart Attack while returning from an incident in Engine #17, his death was considered Line of Duty Death. Chief Baker retired in 2002 and would be succeded by C.A. Lacroix.\n\n=== C. A. Lacroix (2002\u201312) === \nLacroix started his new position in 2002 after former Chief Baker had retired. In 1999, the fire departments had decided to help make a bigger role in the [[Emergency Medical Service]] by adding five Advanced Life Supports called E22, E23, E24, E27, E29, and these support systems were put into effect in 2002. On December 7th, 2007 \"one of the worst ice storms Tulsa would ever see\". The station had received hundreds of calls of power outages, damaged properties, civilian casualties, and the total loss of life at 60. During the 2008\u20132009 Recession, the department faced some budget cuts and downsizing within the company. Lacroix was the chief who got to experience the good effects of [[Vision 2025]] when it started to happen around this period of time. Lacroix had been in command for 10 years when he decided to retire in Mid-June of 2012.\n\n=== R. D. Driskell (2012\u2013present) ===\nDriskell was employed with the position in late June of 2012. In Driskell current term he experienced the mobile rise of technology within the company.\"Former Fire Chief E. Stanley Hawkins passed away in July 2013 at the age of 92 years. Chief Hawkins served the Department for 37 years, of which 21 years were as Chief\". In 2015, Captain Greta Hurt was promoted to District Chief.

C. Alder was elected Fire chief for the city of Tulsa. In 1901, The Fire Department received their first alarm and responded and deployed hoses and water more effectively than ever before. The city council decided to pay for a chemical truck and start paying them for their response. The Chemical truck was named \"Old Soda Fountain\" and saved multiple buildings while in service. In early 1905 Chief Alder was sent to [[Kansas City]], [[Missouri]] to choose some new recruits and a horse team, this started the first paid Fire Department.\n\n=== R. C. Alder (1900\u201322) ===\nWhen the Electric call boxes started appearing around Tulsa it allowed the Tulsa Fire Department to respond more efficiently and frequently to calls. In February 1906, the Tulsa Fire Department was called the most perfect Department in the country. The head of the rating bureau, Mr. Ingalls said if all the Fire Departments in America followed off of Tulsa the number of fire losses would be decreased by 50% nationwide. On March 19, 1906, The Electrical inspector and Chief Alder Activated alarm box #39 at 5th & Cheyenne and even though it was supper relief time 2 men responded in 1 minute and 20 seconds. The Tulsa Fire Department would receive their 1st motorized vehicle in 1907 and when chief Alder requested another motorized vehicle the request was denied because they thought that horse-drawn wagons could never be replaced. In 1908 the Tulsa Fire Department received their 1st aerial ladder truck, a horse team, and a 75-foot aerial ladder for $5,000. By October 1, 1913, everything in Tulsa Fire Department was motorized. The Tulsa Fire Department was the first Fire department west of the [[Mississippi River]] to be completely motorized. On October 24, 1917, two firefighters, Ross Shepard and Ben Hanes were killed while fighting a fire at the [[Mayo Building (Tulsa, Oklahoma)]] from falling through a stairwell. In 1919 the men had 84 hour work weeks divided into two shifts.\n\n=== Wesley Bush (1922\u201326) ===\nWhile chief Wesley Bush was chief, Tulsa Fire Department received 3 new [[Seagrave Fire Apparatus]] pumper trucks in 1924. The department had 13 companies and 122 men on the payroll in 1924. On July 1, 1926, the end of the [[fiscal year]] showed that the Tulsa Fire Department had responded to 1,091 alarms. Later that year Bush stepped down from his position as fire chief.\n\n=== R. E. Pitts (1926\u201333) ===\nThe [[National Board of Fire Underwriters]] rated Tulsa Fire Department one of the best in the nation in 1927. The Department ranked among the best despite being undermanned and inadequately equipped. On April 3, 1928, the firemen submitted a \"petition NO. 2\" to raise the salary from $0.42 an hour to $0.56 per hour. In 1931 each man signed a contract saying they would pay the survivors of an active firefighter in the event they died on or off the job. In 1931 the Fire Department had 161 men, 12 pump trucks, 4 ladders, and 3 hose carts. Chief R. E. Pitts retired on June 28, 1933.\n\n=== R. W. Granger (1933\u201340) ===\nGranger started his career with the company on June 1, 1933 as fire chief.  \"In December\nof 1935, Chief Granger made up a Drill Evolution Instruction Guide for governing Company\nEvolutions. It consisted of \"Order No. l,\" which spelled out how the Drill Evolutions would be carried out, and \"Evolution No. l,\" which was to lay a line into the Drill Tower and charge it\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoftulsa.org/media/3311/tfdhistory2-2017.pdf|title=History of Tulsa Fire Department}}{{fix|text=author?|link=WP:SPS}}</ref> Granger enjoyed a \"good\" 7 years before being replaced by Fire Chief C.C. Jennings, whom would serve for 10 years.\n\n=== C. C. Jennings (1940\u201350) ===\nIn 1940 the Fire Department received 2 1939 Ford sedans for the district chiefs. In 1941 Captain J.C. Warf was thrown from an open cab Seagrave pumper truck during a collision at pine & Rockford. Captain Warf died at the age of 51 the next day at Hillcrest medical center. In 1943, each Tulsa fire truck would receive a 2 way mobile radio. In 1945 the Tulsa Fire Department got their own radio station and would be the most well equipped Fire Department in the Midwest. In 1949 Fire Station #16 was opened and equipped with a 1949 500 gallon American La France Pumper. After 30 years of service, Chief Jennings retired from the department, he had been Chief for 10 years. \n\n=== G. N. Paris (1950\u201356) ===\nChief Paris was the Department's sixth Fire Chief and would remain in this position for 6 years. On January 29, 1955, the Department changed to a schedule of 24 hours on 48 off. On May 15, 1956, Chief Paris retired after 27 years with the department, his time as Chief was relatively uneventful.\n\n=== Galaird Sartain (1956\u201364) ===\nGalaird was put in as chief after Paris had retired two days prior to his inauguration as chief. \"On October 6, 1956, fire destroyed the downtown Safeway Store. The loss was estimated to be at $500,000. The fire broke through the roof, imperiling some thirty homes in the area\". this was a pivotal moment in the beginning of his career as chief. In 1958, 4 new Fire Stations were built and put in the city that year. \"In 1961, the Tulsa Fire Department received the highest honor ever afforded a Fire Department in Oklahoma\". The Tulsa Fire Department was chosen by the [[National Fire Protection Association]] to be included in a training video \"Fighting Tank Fires\". In 1964, Chief Sartain retired on July 1st after about 8 years with the force. He was preceded by E. S. Hawkins<ref>https://www.cityoftulsa.org/media/3311/tfdhistory2-2017.pdf</ref>.\n\n=== E. S. Hawkins (1964\u201385) ===\nAt the beginning of his time as Chief, the Tulsa Fire Department was said to have been worth around $1,117,225. In 1965 the Tulsa Fire Department purchased a aircraft accident truck and station it at [[Tulsa International Airport]] as Unit 51. In 1965 a fire at the London Square apartments claimed the lives of a mother and her 3 kids. The fire brought attention to the fact that fire walls weren't being built in multi-dwelling buildings such as the London Square Apartments. A year later in 1966 another fire broke out in the London Square Apartments but the fire was under control quickly and was put out efficiently. The Tulsa Fire Department said it was because a Fire Wall was built. In 1965 Tulsa Fire Department started installing the micro wave teletype which would replace underground cables.\n\nOn November 22, 1967, R.C. Alder (first fire chief of Tulsa) made his last run at the age of 90 after his death: his flag covered casket was taken to Rose Hill Park on Engine #4. In 1968 Tulsa firefighters voted to raise the retirement fund to $3,500. Firefighters were required to use full protective clothing and use the [[SCBA]] in 1978. T.R. Coatney suffered a heart attack and died at station 11 on June 29, 1978, his death was considered a Line of Duty Death. Tulsa Fire Department created a 4 minute response time standard for EMS calls in 1981. In 1982, members of the Tulsa Fire Department were called to crutchfield park to fill a small pool with water for the filming of [[The Outsiders (film)]]. The Fire Department also helped wet down streets for night filming. In 1982 Dwight Wilson of Station 19 was awarded the [[Certificate of Merit]] by the [[American Red Cross]] for resuscitating a 15 year old boy who was exposed to smoke. Chief Hawkins retired in 1985 after 21 years as Chief.\n\n=== T. L. Baker (1985\u20132002) ===\nChief Baker's time as Chief was relatively uneventful until April 19, 1995 when an explosion at the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma City]] killed 168 people. Multiple rescue crews responded from Tulsa and around the country, this would later be known as the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], and it would be the most deadly terrorist attack in America until the [[September 11 attack]]. The budget for Tulsa Fire Department in 1996 was $40.2 million. W.D. Meyers suffered a Heart Attack while returning from an incident in Engine #17, his death was considered Line of Duty Death. Chief Baker retired in 2002 and would be succeded by C.A. Lacroix.\n\n=== C. A. Lacroix (2002\u201312) === \nLacroix started his new position in 2002 after former Chief Baker had retired. In 1999, the fire departments had decided to help make a bigger role in the [[Emergency Medical Service]] by adding five Advanced Life Supports called E22, E23, E24, E27, E29, and these support systems were put into effect in 2002. On December 7th, 2007 \"one of the worst ice storms Tulsa would ever see\". The station had received hundreds of calls of power outages, damaged properties, civilian casualties, and the total loss of life at 60. During the 2008\u20132009 Recession, the department faced some budget cuts and downsizing within the company. Lacroix was the chief who got to experience the good effects of [[Vision 2025]] when it started to happen around this period of time. Lacroix had been in command for 10 years when he decided to retire in Mid-June of 2012.\n\n=== R. D. Driskell (2012\u2013present) ===\nDriskell was employed with the position in late June of 2012. In Driskell current term he experienced the mobile rise of technology within the company.\"Former Fire Chief E. Stanley Hawkins passed away in July 2013 at the age of 92 years. Chief Hawkins served the Department for 37 years, of which 21 years were as Chief\". In 2015, Captain Greta Hurt was promoted to District Chief. She is the first to achieve that accomplishment and being the first female firefighter of the department. \"Twenty-three people were hospitalized in October 2015, after a rash of [[K2 (drug)]] poisonings hit Tulsa. Many were patrons of the Iron Gate Soup kitchen downtown\". Driskell still today holds the position of chief to the current day and serving only a little over 7 years with the department so far.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.cityoftulsa.org/government/departments/fire/ Official website]\n\n{{Tulsa}}\n{{Oklahoma}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Ambulance services in the United States]]\n[[Category:Fire departments in Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Medical and health organizations based in Oklahoma]]\n", "name_user": "Jerry Steinfield", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eR.

He chooses Aamir and Abiha.\n\nWaqar Zaka reveals a twist in which from this point onward in the game all eliminated contestants will remain in the house with ''Loser'' status. The ''losers'' can disrupt and menace with the existing housemates' belonging in attempt to frustrate them into leaving the house and replace them. If any of the ''losers'' decides to leave the house the prize money will be halved.\n\n| 11.17\n|[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4d5ZLZy8D4]\n|-\n! 17\n| 10 February 2020 \n| align=\"left\" |  '''Day 4'''<br />\nExisting contestants and ''losers'' return to the house.

The episode ends with Abiha crying because Rabail aired her personal family issues to other housemates.\n| 12.80\n|[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=146Cxiu0joo]\n|-\n! 18\n| 17 February 2020 \n| align=\"left\" |  '''Day 4 \u2013 Day 5'''<br />\nRabail gets into a physical altercation with Yahya and throws her slipper at him. Contestants are called to the rooftop for a challenge.\n\n'''Reward Challenge:''' Contestants have to balance a pot full of burning coal using a mount on their heads while circling around a center platform. When Waqar Zaka calls out ''\"[[Pelvic thrust|Thumka]]\"'' they must try to eliminate a contestant by making their pot fall using only pelvic thrust movement.<br />\n:''Result:'' Bilal quits as soon as the task begins being not able to withstand the heat from the burning coal. Daniya eliminates Abiha. Rabail and Aamir team up and target the other alliance members one by one eliminating everyone else. Aamit volunteers to lose making Rabail the winner. Rabail wins a [[Rebel (company)|Rebel]] watch and gifts it to Aamir.\n\nRabail is disqualified by Waqar Zaka for physical violence toward Kashaf and Yahya. In rage, she attacks Kashaf beating her repeatedly and leaves the challenge location to return to the house. While housemates discuss these proceedings of the night Waqar Zaka announces that Rabail may stay in the house as ''loser'' and can earn entry back into game. Two alliances clearly emerge. The alliance of Kashaf, Daniya, Yahya and Rubaisha is enraged and contemplates quitting the show.\n\n'''Day 5'''\n\nContestants reach the location of the elimination challenge. They are instructed to form pairs. Kashaf and Rubaisha choose each other. Yahya pairs with Daniya and Bilal is left alone. Waqar tells Bilal to convince Daniya into pairing with him instead.

Based on 168 reviews collected by [[IMDb]], the show has an average score of 7.6/10.<ref name=\"imdb.com\"/> Viewership peaked at a near 15 million live viewers on 17 February 2020 (Episode 18) which marked the episode as one of the most-watched television telecast in Pakistan and [[Bol Network]]'s highest viewing figures to date. Episodes made available on [[Youtube]] following the live telecast received over 2 million views in a 24-hour span and were trending on Youtube in Pakistan and India over the course of respective weekly releases.<ref name=\"bolnews.com\"/> Ratings declined subsequently in episodes that followed. Critics compared the series to a [[soap opera]] commenting that the episodes contain merely ''10 minutes of watch-worthy content which is made up into a 90 minute episode''. The series was also accused of [[clickbaiting]] viewers for majority of the episodes. Content shown in teasers and thumbnails is usually flashy and falsely advertised to appear the coming week and does not actually unfold until a few weeks later.\n\n==Criticism and controversy==\n===Selection of certain housemates===\nThe programme attracted criticism in December 2019 for putting several vulnerable people through to the auditions. Rabail Sheikh, an aspiring model, who had a history of [[substance abuse]] and suffered from [[Intermittent explosive disorder]] was selected after she attempted to expose a cricketer by threatening to leak a lewd video as leverage. There was no psych test done to screen any participants to determine if they are fit to enter the house. Muhammad Yahya had arm disability, Muhammad Bilal a [[cleft palette]] and difficulty in speaking and Daniya Kanwal who suffered from [[asthma]] were all selected in auditions as [[Tokenism|token diversity]].\n\n===Legal complications and censorship===\nDuring the auditions Rabail revealed that she has a private video of a famous Pakistani cricketer who had allegedly stripped down on webcam and showed her his genitals in the video.<ref>https://www.kansascity-comiccon.com/complete-audition-of-rabail-sheikh-champions-audition-waqar-zaka-show-vidA4onYNX3xMAHd</ref> The video was blurred during telecast and Rabail was persuaded to delete it in order for her to get selected as contestant. However it is alleged that the video is still in possession of Rabail. <br />\n[[Hareem Shah]] and Sandal Khattak appeared during auditions and discussed their media scandals in details on the show. They claimed to have videos and audio recordings of news anchor [[Mubashir Lucman]] and Minister [[Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad|Sheikh Rasheed]].<ref>https://www.newsdesk.pk/hareem-shah-new-video-leaked-by-bhola-record-hareem-leaks/</ref><ref>https://www.oyeyeah.com/celebrity/hareem-shah-scandal-things-are-getting-out-of-hands/</ref> Prior to the show they had released several snippets of their conversation with Lucman and Rasheed as evidence which became popular on social media in mid-2019.<ref>https://www.mangobaaz.com/a-new-video-of-tiktok-star-hareem-shah-has-leaked-this-its-with-sheikh-rashid</ref><ref>https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/tiktok-star-hareem-shah-video-sheikh-rasheed-ahmad-imran-khan-pakistan-1633398-2020-01-02</ref> Waqar Zaka revealed that Bol Network had received threats from Lucman's team to pursue legal action against the network to stop the telecast of the episodes featuring Shah and Khattak.

Based on 168 reviews collected by [[IMDb]], the show has an average score of 7.6/10.<ref name=\"imdb.com\"/> Viewership peaked at a near 15 million live viewers on 17 February 2020 (Episode 18) which marked the episode as one of the most-watched television telecast in Pakistan and [[Bol Network]]'s highest viewing figures to date. Episodes made available on [[Youtube]] following the live telecast received over 2 million views in a 24-hour span and were trending on Youtube in Pakistan and India over the course of respective weekly releases.<ref name=\"bolnews.com\"/> Ratings declined subsequently in episodes that followed. Critics compared the series to a [[soap opera]] commenting that the episodes contain merely ''10 minutes of watch-worthy content which is made up into a 90 minute episode''. The series was also accused of [[clickbaiting]] viewers for majority of the episodes. Content shown in teasers and thumbnails is usually flashy and falsely advertised to appear the coming week and does not actually unfold until a few weeks later.\n\n==Criticism and controversy==\n===Selection of certain housemates===\nThe programme attracted criticism in December 2019 for putting several vulnerable people through to the auditions. Rabail Sheikh, an aspiring model, who had a history of [[substance abuse]] and suffered from [[Intermittent explosive disorder]] was selected after she attempted to expose a cricketer by threatening to leak a lewd video as leverage. There was no psych test done to screen any participants to determine if they are fit to enter the house. Muhammad Yahya had arm disability, Muhammad Bilal a [[cleft palette]] and difficulty in speaking and Daniya Kanwal who suffered from [[asthma]] were all selected in auditions as [[Tokenism|token diversity]].\n\n===Legal complications and censorship===\nDuring the auditions Rabail revealed that she has a private video of a famous Pakistani cricketer who had allegedly stripped down on webcam and showed her his genitals in the video.<ref>https://www.kansascity-comiccon.com/complete-audition-of-rabail-sheikh-champions-audition-waqar-zaka-show-vidA4onYNX3xMAHd</ref> The video was blurred during telecast and Rabail was persuaded to delete it in order for her to get selected as contestant. However it is alleged that the video is still in possession of Rabail. <br />\n[[Hareem Shah]] and Sandal Khattak appeared during auditions and discussed their media scandals in details on the show. They claimed to have videos and audio recordings of news anchor [[Mubashir Lucman]] and Minister [[Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad|Sheikh Rasheed]].<ref>https://www.newsdesk.pk/hareem-shah-new-video-leaked-by-bhola-record-hareem-leaks/</ref><ref>https://www.oyeyeah.com/celebrity/hareem-shah-scandal-things-are-getting-out-of-hands/</ref> Prior to the show they had released several snippets of their conversation with Lucman and Rasheed as evidence which became popular on social media in mid-2019.<ref>https://www.mangobaaz.com/a-new-video-of-tiktok-star-hareem-shah-has-leaked-this-its-with-sheikh-rashid</ref><ref>https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/tiktok-star-hareem-shah-video-sheikh-rasheed-ahmad-imran-khan-pakistan-1633398-2020-01-02</ref> Waqar Zaka revealed that Bol Network had received threats from Lucman's team to pursue legal action against the network to stop the telecast of the episodes featuring Shah and Khattak. Shah and Khattak were selected to become housemates but did not enter the house amidst these complications.\n\n===Discrimination and abuse===\nThe production was heavily criticized for its leniency towards unacceptable behavior among housemates and telecasting strong themes under the pretense of [[Television content rating system|family show]]. Caste-based discrimination and [[Discrimination based on skin color|colorism]] were primary underlying themes in conversations inside the house. [[Bol Network]] received 1574 complaints after Episode 17 was aired regarding Rabail and Aamir's behavior toward Kashaf.<ref>https://dailytimes.com.pk/13503/pemra-revokes-bol-news-bol-entertainment-licenses/</ref><ref>https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/09/06/pemra-issues-show-cause-notice-to-bol-news/</ref> Rabail alongside Aamir called Kashaf dark, fat and ugly on several instances, spat on her, destroyed her clothes and physically assaulted her repeatedly after an elimination task.<ref>https://runwaypakistan.com/is-bol-champions-the-type-of-content-we-want/</ref> On a separate occasion Rabail sprayed Daniya with an [[aerosol spray]] triggering an asthma attack for which she had to be hospitalized for the night. Rabail was disqualified but made to stay on the show to garner more ratings hence rewarding her behavior.<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/1499482/pemra-issues-show-cause-notices-bol-news-urdu-1/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=2997962ffd6875fa911157254dc6f7558afcbab5-1582304610-0-Aan94MNl5RohOHlYC57z0XYnv2Xp8k5scWnEJUpfH9PRfmruPZzKxZ4qTOfoo5N6lzqTA7Ikfw4HwMzWTEbQtp7M_Jrj8OsmmhsZNmA_NKDEIpZ8F9N704IzGEuxYmiDJvC0aQRZBTLYZPhQX-CI5suXaK5ne_A4iXkcsClmA87zQsO5gwbbUOXNLSsg3SzKt4-H9yncbp2yE7L1ohk9Xl9inlMs2AZiC1MagHjSDk0CqBTD-jqUau6pw869vcoCwrhHraTNZu63rFsOJsKaOTkNuJSvbl9VJmsk4tYZYsKv4IAXoQaFIYss5w1F6a7vHUC6jo2PcVkC9JCdMBnzUbqg_PbmtFw60SoA5KXLYlcz</ref><ref>https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/549523-pemra-warns-public-against-buying-tv-channel-s-scratch-cards</ref>\n\nRabail, on day 2, [[outed]] Hammad telling housemates that he had confided in her about the past lover he mentioned during auditions being a man. Previous to this incident many housemates including Daniya, Tooba and Sidra had referred to Hammad as ''meetha'' a derogatory term used in Urdu for homosexual or [[effeminate]] men.<ref>https://dailytimes.com.pk/463433/with-rampant-misogyny-homophobia-punjabi-sunni-supremacy-pakistan-wonders-why-the-world-isnt-buying-its-pro-human-rights-kashmir-stance/</ref> Hammad [[came out as gay]] on his youtube channel after he was evicted.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8u5FfXNTqE&t=160s</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.bolentertainment.com/tv-shows/champions/}}\n* {{IMDb title | id= tt11421324}}\n\n[[Category:BOL Network]]\n[[Category:Pakistani reality television series]]\n[[Category:2019 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n", "name_user": "Balach Masud", "label": "safe", "comment": "I changed the age of contestant Balach masud which was wrong.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champions_(Pakistani_TV_series)"}

[[Karl Marx]] thought \"class\" was defined by one's relationship to the [[means of production]] (their [[relations of production]]). His simple understanding of classes in modern [[Capitalism|capitalist society]] is the [[proletariat]], those who work but do not own the means of production; and the [[bourgeoisie]], those who invest and live off the surplus generated by the proletariat's operation of the [[means of production]]. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist [[Max Weber]], who argued \"class\" is determined by economic position, in contrast to \"[[social status]]\" or \"''Stand''\"<!--German term, could be confused with English word, so italics needed--> which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.<ref>Weber, Max (1921/2015). \"Classes, St\u00e4nde, Parties\" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy and Social Stratification.  Edited and Translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, pp. 37\u201358.</ref> The term \"class\" is etymologically derived from the Latin ''classis'', which was used by [[census]] takers to categorize citizens by wealth in order to determine military service obligations.<ref>{{cite book |author=Brown, D.F. |chapter=Social class and Status |editor=Mey, Jacob |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Pragmatics |publisher=Elsevier |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-08-096297-9 |page=952 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmXgeBE7k0C&pg=PA952}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 18th century, the term \"class\" began to replace classifications such as [[Estates of the realm|estates]], [[Nobility|rank]] and [[Religious order|orders]] as the primary means of organizing society into hierarchical divisions. This corresponded to a general decrease in significance ascribed to hereditary characteristics and increase in the significance of wealth and [[income]] as indicators of position in the [[Social stratification|social hierarchy]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Class, Social |editor=Kuper, Adam |title=The social science encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-32096-2 |page=111 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oES3pJufP4C&pg=PA111}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Penney, Robert |chapter=Class, social|editors=Christensen, Karen & Levinson, David |title=Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7619-2598-9 |page=189 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&pg=PA189}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:Burmese nobles.JPG|thumb|[[Burma|Burmese]] nobles and servants]]\nHistorically, social class and behavior were laid down in law. For example, permitted mode of dress in some times and places was strictly regulated, with sumptuous dressing only for the high ranks of society and [[aristocracy]], whereas [[sumptuary law]]s stipulated the dress and jewelry appropriate for a person's social rank and [[social status|station]]. In Europe, these laws became increasingly commonplace during the Middle Ages. However, these laws were prone to change due to societal changes, and in many cases, these distinctions may either almost disappear, such as the distinction between a patrician and a plebeian being almost erased during the late [[Roman Republic]].\n\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] had a large influence over political ideals of the [[French Revolution]] because of his views of inequality and classes. Rousseau saw humans as \"naturally pure and good,\" meaning that humans from birth were seen as innocent and any evilness was learned. He believed that social problems arise through the development of society and suppressing the innate pureness of humankind. He also believed that [[private property]] is the main reason for social issues in society because private property creates inequality through the property's value. Even though his theory predicted if there were no private property then there would be wide spread equality, Rousseau accepted that there will always be social inequality because of how society is viewed and run.<ref name=\"Conley, Dalton 2017\">{{cite book|author=Conley, Dalton|chapter=Stratification|editor=Bakeman, Karl|title=You May Ask Yourself, 5th Edition|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.|year=2017}}</ref>\n\nLater Enlightenment thinkers viewed inequality as valuable and crucial to society's development and prosperity. They also acknowledged that private property will ultimately cause inequality because specific resources that are privately owned can be stored and the owners profit off of the deficit of the resource. This can create competition between the classes that was seen as necessary by these thinkers.<ref name=\"Conley, Dalton 2017\"/> This also creates [[Social stratification|stratification]] between the classes keeping a distinct difference between lower, poorer classes and the higher, wealthier classes.\n\n==Theoretical models==\nDefinitions of social classes reflect a number of [[social theory|sociological perspectives]], informed by [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. The major perspectives historically have been [[Marxism]] and [[structural functionalism]]. The common stratum model of class divides society into a simple hierarchy of [[working class]], [[middle class]] and [[upper class]]. Within academia, two broad schools of definitions emerge: those aligned with 20th-century sociological stratum models of class society and those aligned with the 19th-century [[historical materialist]] economic models of the [[Marxist]]s and [[anarchist]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Serravallo, Vincent|chapter=Class|editor=Parrillo, Vincent N.|title=Encyclopedia of social problems, Volume 1|publisher=SAGE|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4129-4165-5|page=131|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mRGr_B4Y1CEC&pg=PA131}}</ref><ref name=\"The American Class Structure\">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink =  | year = 1998 | title = The American Class Structure | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-534-50520-2 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/americanclassstr0000gilb_c7f2 }}</ref><ref name=\"Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships\">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = |author2=Stacey C.

Objectively, a class shares a common [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]]. Subjectively, the members will necessarily have some perception (\"[[class consciousness]]\") of their similarity and common interest. Class consciousness is not simply an awareness of one's own class interest but is also a set of shared views regarding how society should be organized legally, culturally, socially and politically. These class relations are reproduced through time.\n\nIn [[Marxist theory]], the [[class structure]] of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is characterized by the conflict between two main classes: the [[bourgeoisie]], the capitalists who own the [[means of production]] and the much larger [[proletariat]] (or \"working class\") who must sell their own labour power ([[wage labour]]). This is the fundamental economic structure of work and property, a state of inequality that is normalized and [[Base and superstructure|reproduced through cultural ideology]].\n\nFor Marxists, every person in the process of production has separate social relationships and issues. Along with this, every person is placed into different groups that have similar interests and values that can differ drastically from group to group. Class is special in that does not relate to specifically to a singular person, but to a specific role.<ref name=\"Conley, Dalton 2017\"/>\n\nMarxists explain the history of \"civilized\" societies in terms of a [[class conflict|war of classes]] between those who control production and those who produce the goods or services in society. In the Marxist view of [[capitalism]], this is a conflict between capitalists ([[bourgeoisie]]) and wage-workers (the proletariat). For Marxists, class antagonism is rooted in the situation that control over social production necessarily entails control over the class which produces goods\u2014in capitalism this is the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of workers by the bourgeoisie.<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 231.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, \"in countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed\".<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 231</ref> \"An industrial army of workmen, under the command of a capitalist, requires, like a real army, officers (managers) and sergeants (foremen, over-lookers) who, while the work is being done, command in the name of the capitalist\".<ref>Karl Marx. ''Capital: An Analysis of Capitalist Production'', Volume 1; Moscow; 1959; p. 332.</ref>\n\nMarx makes the argument that, as the bourgeoisie reach a point of wealth accumulation, they hold enough power as the dominant class to shape political institutions and society according to their own interests. Marx then goes on to claim that the non-elite class, owing to their large numbers, have the power to overthrow the elite and create an equal society.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Manifesto of the Communist Party|url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/|website = www.marxists.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Marx himself argued that it was the goal of the proletariat itself to displace the capitalist system with [[socialism]], changing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which: \"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\". This would mark the beginning of a [[classless society]] in which human needs rather than profit would be motive for production. In a society with democratic control and [[production for use]], there would be no class, no state and no need for financial and banking institutions and money.<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 232-234.</ref><ref>Karl Marx ''Critique of the Gotha Program'' (1875)</ref>\n\nThese theorists have taken this binary class system and expanded it to include contradictory class locations, the idea that a person can be employed in many different class locations that fall between the two classes of proletariat and bourgeoisie. [[Erik Olin Wright]] stated that class definitions are more diverse and elaborate through identifying with multiple classes, having familial ties with people in different a class, or having a temporary leadership role.<ref name=\"Conley, Dalton 2017\"/>\n\n===Weberian===\n{{main|Three-component theory of stratification}}\n[[Max Weber]] formulated a [[three-component theory of stratification]] that saw social class as emerging from an interplay between \"class\", \"status\" and \"power\". Weber believed that class position was determined by a person's relationship to the means of production, while status or \"Stand\" emerged from estimations of honor or prestige.<ref>Weber, Max (2015/1921).  \"Classes, St\u00e4nde, Parties\" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, pp. 37\u201357.</ref>\n\nWeber views class as a group of people who have common goals and opportunities that are available to them. This means that what separates each class from each other is their value in the marketplace through their own goods and services. This creates a divide between the classes through the assets that they have such as property and expertise.<ref name=\"Conley, Dalton 2017\"/>\n\nWeber derived many of his key concepts on social stratification by examining the social structure of many countries. He noted that contrary to Marx's theories, stratification was based on more than simply ownership of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Weber pointed out that some members of the aristocracy lack economic wealth yet might nevertheless have political power. Likewise in Europe, many wealthy Jewish families lacked prestige and honor because they were considered members of a \"pariah group\".\n* Class: A person's economic position in a society. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own.\n* Status: A person's prestige, social honor or popularity in a society. Weber noted that political power was not rooted in capital value solely, but also in one's status. Poets and saints, for example, can possess immense influence on society with often little economic worth.\n* Power: A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], or a member of the [[United States Congress]], may hold little property or status, but they still hold immense power.\n\n===Great British Class Survey===\n{{Main|Great British Class Survey}}\nOn April 2, 2013, the results of a survey<ref name=\"BBC Lab UK Survey\">{{cite web|url=https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/labuk/experiments/the-great-british-class-survey|title=Britain's Real Class System: Great British Class Survey|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=BBC Lab UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |accessdate=April 4, 2013}}</ref> conducted by [[BBC Lab UK]] developed in collaboration with academic experts and slated to be published in the journal ''[[Sociology (journal)|Sociology]]'' were published online.<ref name=Sociology4213>{{cite journal|last=Savage|first=Mike|last2=Devine |first2=Fiona |last3=Cunningham |first3=Niall |last4=Taylor |first4=Mark |last5=Li |first5=Yaojun |author6=Johs.

They usually wield the greatest political power. In some countries, wealth alone is sufficient to allow entry into the upper class. In others, only people who are born or marry into certain aristocratic bloodlines are considered members of the upper class and those who gain great wealth through commercial activity are looked down upon by the aristocracy as ''[[nouveau riche]]''.<ref>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, \"nouveau riche French Usually Disparaging. a person who is newly rich\", 1969, Random House</ref> In the United Kingdom, for example, the upper classes are the aristocracy and royalty, with wealth playing a less important role in class status. Many aristocratic peerages or titles have seats attached to them, with the holder of the title (e.g. Earl of Bristol) and his family being the custodians of the house, but not the owners. Many of these require high expenditures, so wealth is typically needed. Many aristocratic peerages and their homes are parts of estates, owned and run by the title holder with moneys generated by the land, rents or other sources of wealth. However, in the United States where there is no aristocracy or royalty, the upper class status belongs to the extremely wealthy, the so-called \"super-rich\", though there is some tendency even in the United States for those with old family wealth to look down on those who have earned their money in business, the struggle between [[nouveau riche|new money]] and [[old money]].\n\nThe upper class is the group of people located at the top of the socioeconomic chart.\u00a0They are the highest you can be. Although they have many luxuries, they live with a safety net of money. The upper class generally has a big influence on the world and nations economy.\u00a0In the United States, they are considered \"the top one-percent\".\n\nThe upper class is generally contained within the richest one or two percent of the population.

As a result of conquest or internal ethnic differentiation, a ruling class is often ethnically homogenous and particular races or ethnic groups in some societies are legally or customarily restricted to occupying particular class positions. Which ethnicities are considered as belonging to high or low classes varies from society to society.\n\nIn modern societies, strict legal links between ethnicity and class have been drawn, such as in [[apartheid]], the [[caste system in Africa]], the position of the [[Burakumin]] in Japanese society and the [[casta]] system in Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Class stratification]]\n* [[Drift hypothesis]]\n* [[Elite theory]]\n* [[Elitism]]\n* [[Four occupations]]\n* [[Health equity]]\n* [[Inca society]]\n* [[Korean ruling class]]\n* [[Mass society]]\n* [[National Statistics Socio-economic Classification]]\n* [[Passing (sociology)]]\n* [[Ranked society]]\n* [[Raznochintsy]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n60.

[[Karl Marx]] thought \"class\" was defined by one's relationship to the [[means of production]] (their [[relations of production]]). His simple understanding of classes in modern [[Capitalism|capitalist society]] is the [[proletariat]], those who work but do not own the means of production; and the [[bourgeoisie]], those who invest and live off the surplus generated by the proletariat's operation of the [[means of production]]. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist [[Max Weber]], who argued \"class\" is determined by economic position, in contrast to \"[[social status]]\" or \"''Stand''\"<!--German term, could be confused with English word, so italics needed--> which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.<ref>Weber, Max (1921/2015). \"Classes, St\u00e4nde, Parties\" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy and Social Stratification.

This corresponded to a general decrease in significance ascribed to hereditary characteristics and increase in the significance of wealth and [[income]] as indicators of position in the [[Social stratification|social hierarchy]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Class, Social |editor=Kuper, Adam |title=The social science encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-32096-2 |page=111 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oES3pJufP4C&pg=PA111}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Penney, Robert |chapter=Class, social|editors=Christensen, Karen & Levinson, David |title=Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7619-2598-9 |page=189 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&pg=PA189}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:Burmese nobles.JPG|thumb|[[Burma|Burmese]] nobles and servants]]\nHistorically, social class and behavior were laid down in law. For example, permitted mode of dress in some times and places was strictly regulated, with sumptuous dressing only for the high ranks of society and [[aristocracy]], whereas [[sumptuary law]]s stipulated the dress and jewelry appropriate for a person's social rank and [[social status|station]]. In Europe, these laws became increasingly commonplace during the Middle Ages. However, these laws were prone to change due to societal changes, and in many cases, these distinctions may either almost disappear, such as the distinction between a patrician and a plebeian being almost erased during the late [[Roman Republic]].\n\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] had a large influence over political ideals of the [[French Revolution]] because of his views of inequality and classes. Rousseau saw humans as \"naturally pure and good,\" meaning that humans from birth were seen as innocent and any evilness was learned. He believed that social problems arise through the development of society and suppressing the innate pureness of humankind. He also believed that [[private property]] is the main reason for social issues in society because private property creates inequality through the property's value. Even though his theory predicted if there were no private property then there would be wide spread equality, Rousseau accepted that there will always be social inequality because of how society is viewed and run.<ref name=\"Conley, Dalton 2017\">{{cite book|author=Conley, Dalton|chapter=Stratification|editor=Bakeman, Karl|title=You May Ask Yourself, 5th Edition|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.|year=2017}}</ref>\n\nLater Enlightenment thinkers viewed inequality as valuable and crucial to society's development and prosperity. They also acknowledged that private property will ultimately cause inequality because specific resources that are privately owned can be stored and the owners profit off of the deficit of the resource. This can create competition between the classes that was seen as necessary by these thinkers.<ref name=\"Conley, Dalton 2017\"/> This also creates [[Social stratification|stratification]] between the classes keeping a distinct difference between lower, poorer classes and the higher, wealthier classes.\n\n==Theoretical models==\nDefinitions of social classes reflect a number of [[social theory|sociological perspectives]], informed by [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. The major perspectives historically have been [[Marxism]] and [[structural functionalism]]. The common stratum model of class divides society into a simple hierarchy of [[working class]], [[middle class]] and [[upper class]]. Within academia, two broad schools of definitions emerge: those aligned with 20th-century sociological stratum models of class society and those aligned with the 19th-century [[historical materialist]] economic models of the [[Marxist]]s and [[anarchist]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Serravallo, Vincent|chapter=Class|editor=Parrillo, Vincent N.|title=Encyclopedia of social problems, Volume 1|publisher=SAGE|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4129-4165-5|page=131|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mRGr_B4Y1CEC&pg=PA131}}</ref><ref name=\"The American Class Structure\">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink =  | year = 1998 | title = The American Class Structure | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-534-50520-2 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/americanclassstr0000gilb_c7f2 }}</ref><ref name=\"Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships\">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = |author2=Stacey C.

Objectively, a class shares a common [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]]. Subjectively, the members will necessarily have some perception (\"[[class consciousness]]\") of their similarity and common interest. Class consciousness is not simply an awareness of one's own class interest but is also a set of shared views regarding how society should be organized legally, culturally, socially and politically. These class relations are reproduced through time.\n\nIn [[Marxist theory]], the [[class structure]] of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is characterized by the conflict between two main classes: the [[bourgeoisie]], the capitalists who own the [[means of production]] and the much larger [[proletariat]] (or \"working class\") who must sell their own labour power ([[wage labour]]). This is the fundamental economic structure of work and property, a state of inequality that is normalized and [[Base and superstructure|reproduced through cultural ideology]].\n\nFor Marxists, every person in the process of production has separate social relationships and issues. Along with this, every person is placed into different groups that have similar interests and values that can differ drastically from group to group. Class is special in that does not relate to specifically to a singular person, but to a specific role.<ref name=\"Conley, Dalton 2017\"/>\n\nMarxists explain the history of \"civilized\" societies in terms of a [[class conflict|war of classes]] between those who control production and those who produce the goods or services in society. In the Marxist view of [[capitalism]], this is a conflict between capitalists ([[bourgeoisie]]) and wage-workers (the proletariat). For Marxists, class antagonism is rooted in the situation that control over social production necessarily entails control over the class which produces goods\u2014in capitalism this is the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of workers by the bourgeoisie.<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 231.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, \"in countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed\".<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 231</ref> \"An industrial army of workmen, under the command of a capitalist, requires, like a real army, officers (managers) and sergeants (foremen, over-lookers) who, while the work is being done, command in the name of the capitalist\".<ref>Karl Marx. ''Capital: An Analysis of Capitalist Production'', Volume 1; Moscow; 1959; p. 332.</ref>\n\nMarx makes the argument that, as the bourgeoisie reach a point of wealth accumulation, they hold enough power as the dominant class to shape political institutions and society according to their own interests. Marx then goes on to claim that the non-elite class, owing to their large numbers, have the power to overthrow the elite and create an equal society.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Manifesto of the Communist Party|url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/|website = www.marxists.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Marx himself argued that it was the goal of the proletariat itself to displace the capitalist system with [[socialism]], changing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which: \"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\". This would mark the beginning of a [[classless society]] in which human needs rather than profit would be motive for production. In a society with democratic control and [[production for use]], there would be no class, no state and no need for financial and banking institutions and money.<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 232-234.</ref><ref>Karl Marx ''Critique of the Gotha Program'' (1875)</ref>\n\nThese theorists have taken this binary class system and expanded it to include contradictory class locations, the idea that a person can be employed in many different class locations that fall between the two classes of proletariat and bourgeoisie. [[Erik Olin Wright]] stated that class definitions are more diverse and elaborate through identifying with multiple classes, having familial ties with people in different a class, or having a temporary leadership role.<ref name=\"Conley, Dalton 2017\"/>\n\n===Weberian===\n{{main|Three-component theory of stratification}}\n[[Max Weber]] formulated a [[three-component theory of stratification]] that saw social class as emerging from an interplay between \"class\", \"status\" and \"power\". Weber believed that class position was determined by a person's relationship to the means of production, while status or \"Stand\" emerged from estimations of honor or prestige.<ref>Weber, Max (2015/1921).  \"Classes, St\u00e4nde, Parties\" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, pp. 37\u201357.</ref>\n\nWeber views class as a group of people who have common goals and opportunities that are available to them. This means that what separates each class from each other is their value in the marketplace through their own goods and services. This creates a divide between the classes through the assets that they have such as property and expertise.<ref name=\"Conley, Dalton 2017\"/>\n\nWeber derived many of his key concepts on social stratification by examining the social structure of many countries. He noted that contrary to Marx's theories, stratification was based on more than simply ownership of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Weber pointed out that some members of the aristocracy lack economic wealth yet might nevertheless have political power. Likewise in Europe, many wealthy Jewish families lacked prestige and honor because they were considered members of a \"pariah group\".\n* Class: A person's economic position in a society. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own.\n* Status: A person's prestige, social honor or popularity in a society. Weber noted that political power was not rooted in capital value solely, but also in one's status. Poets and saints, for example, can possess immense influence on society with often little economic worth.\n* Power: A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], or a member of the [[United States Congress]], may hold little property or status, but they still hold immense power.\n\n===Great British Class Survey===\n{{Main|Great British Class Survey}}\nOn April 2, 2013, the results of a survey<ref name=\"BBC Lab UK Survey\">{{cite web|url=https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/labuk/experiments/the-great-british-class-survey|title=Britain's Real Class System: Great British Class Survey|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=BBC Lab UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |accessdate=April 4, 2013}}</ref> conducted by [[BBC Lab UK]] developed in collaboration with academic experts and slated to be published in the journal ''[[Sociology (journal)|Sociology]]'' were published online.<ref name=Sociology4213>{{cite journal|last=Savage|first=Mike|last2=Devine |first2=Fiona |last3=Cunningham |first3=Niall |last4=Taylor |first4=Mark |last5=Li |first5=Yaojun |author6=Johs.

They usually wield the greatest political power. In some countries, wealth alone is sufficient to allow entry into the upper class. In others, only people who are born or marry into certain aristocratic bloodlines are considered members of the upper class and those who gain great wealth through commercial activity are looked down upon by the aristocracy as ''[[nouveau riche]]''.<ref>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, \"nouveau riche French Usually Disparaging. a person who is newly rich\", 1969, Random House</ref> In the United Kingdom, for example, the upper classes are the aristocracy and royalty, with wealth playing a less important role in class status. Many aristocratic peerages or titles have seats attached to them, with the holder of the title (e.g. Earl of Bristol) and his family being the custodians of the house, but not the owners. Many of these require high expenditures, so wealth is typically needed. Many aristocratic peerages and their homes are parts of estates, owned and run by the title holder with moneys generated by the land, rents or other sources of wealth. However, in the United States where there is no aristocracy or royalty, the upper class status belongs to the extremely wealthy, the so-called \"super-rich\", though there is some tendency even in the United States for those with old family wealth to look down on those who have earned their money in business, the struggle between [[nouveau riche|new money]] and [[old money]].\n\nThe upper class is the group of people located at the top of the socioeconomic chart.\u00a0They are the highest you can be. Although they have many luxuries, they live with a safety net of money. The upper class generally has a big influence on the world and nations economy.\u00a0In the United States, they are considered \"the top one-percent\".\n\nThe upper class is generally contained within the richest one or two percent of the population.

Which ethnicities are considered as belonging to high or low classes varies from society to society.\n\nIn modern societies, strict legal links between ethnicity and class have been drawn, such as in [[apartheid]], the [[caste system in Africa]], the position of the [[Burakumin]] in Japanese society and the [[casta]] system in Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Class stratification]]\n* [[Drift hypothesis]]\n* [[Elite theory]]\n* [[Elitism]]\n* [[Four occupations]]\n* [[Health equity]]\n* [[Inca society]]\n* [[Korean ruling class]]\n* [[Mass society]]\n* [[National Statistics Socio-economic Classification]]\n* [[Passing (sociology)]]\n* [[Ranked society]]\n* [[Raznochintsy]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n60.
