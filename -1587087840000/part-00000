British athletes have appeared in every [[Summer Olympic Games]] of the modern era, alongside Australia, France, Greece, and Switzerland, though Great Britain is the only country to have won at least one gold medal at all of them. Although the British Olympic Association is the National Olympic Committee (NOC) for Great Britain and Northern Ireland,<ref>https://www.teamgb.com/about-boa</ref> [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] athletes can choose whether to compete for Great Britain or for the [[Ireland at the Olympics|Republic of Ireland]], as they are entitled to citizenship of either nation under the [[Good Friday Agreement]]. In 2016 Northern Ireland born representatives in Team GB included returning rowers [[Alan Campbell (rower)|Alan Campbell]], [[Peter Chambers]] and [[Richard Chambers (rower)|Richard Chambers]], archer [[Patrick Huston]] and four members of the men's field hockey team: [[David Ames (field hockey)|David Ames]], [[Mark Gleghorne]], [[Iain Lewers]] and [[Ian Sloan (field hockey)|Ian Sloan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Athletics Ireland defends decision to reject 'all Ireland' motion|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/athletics-ireland-defends-decision-to-reject-all-ireland-motion-1.1740789|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Four NI players in Great Britain men's squad for Rio 2016|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/hockey/36654040|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 September 2016}}</ref> The team also represents, and included representation from, the [[Crown dependencies]], among which were Guernsey's [[Heather Watson]] and [[Carl Hester]], and from the ten of the thirteen [[British Overseas Territories]] represented by the BOA rather than their own NOC,<ref>British Virgin Islands, Bermuda and Caymen Islands all have their own representation at the Olympic Games.

Kenny was immediately followed onto this list by a seventh 'three-peat', fellow cyclist [[Ed Clancy]], who sealed his third consecutive team pursuit gold medal. Indeed, Clancy and Kenny, along with American road cyclist [[Kristin Armstrong]] (in women's time trial) became the first three cyclists to ever achieve the feat.\n\nCyclist [[Laura Kenny|Laura Trott]] also won two gold medals to become Britain's most successful all time female Olympian with a total of four golds, dressage rider [[Charlotte Dujardin]] having briefly taken that title with three golds and a silver from previous incumbent cyclist [[Victoria Pendleton]]. [[Katherine Grainger]]'s fifth consecutive medal, a silver, made her Britain's joint most decorated female Olympian, with [[Kathleen McKane Godfree]] and made her one of only five British Olympians (with [[Sir Steve Redgrave]], [[Sir Ben Ainslie]], [[Sir Bradley Wiggins]] and [[Jack Beresford]]) to win medals in five Games running.\n\nGymnast [[Max Whitlock]] won Britain's first ever gold medals in [[Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics|gymnastics]], in men's floor and pommel horse, while Great Britain's seven gymnastics medals, a record for the team, included first ever medals in men's individual all-around (also for Whitlock), men's horizontal bar for [[Nile Wilson]], women's floor, for the youngest member of the team, 16 year old [[Amy Tinkler]] and trampoline for [[Bryony Page]], while pommel silver medalist [[Louis Smith (gymnast)|Louis Smith]] became the first British gymnast to medal across three Games.\n\nIn [[Rowing at the 2016 Summer Olympics|rowing]], Britain took gold in both the men's coxless four and the men's eights for the first time since 2000, as well as a first ever medal for the women's eight, a silver. [[Pete Reed]] and [[Andrew Triggs Hodge]] in the eight won their third successive gold medals, having won double gold in the four in 2008 and 2012.\n\n[[Alistair Brownlee]] became the first triathlete to successfully defend an Olympic title and his younger brother [[Jonny Brownlee]] upgraded his London bronze to a silver in the [[Triathlon at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's|men's triathlon]], one of three events with the men's pommel and men's individual sprint where Great Britain finished first and second. No British woman having ever defended an individual Olympic title, Trott, Dujardin, taekwondo-ka [[Jade Jones (taekwondo)|Jade Jones]] and boxer [[Nicola Adams]] became the first four British female Olympians ever to successfully defend individual Olympic titles, with Trott becoming the first British female, and fourth Briton with [[Mo Farah]], [[Chris Hoy]] and [[Jason Kenny]] to successfully defend two Olympic titles at the same Games.\n\nIn [[Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics|athletics]] in both the men's 5,000 and 10,000 metres [[Mo Farah]] successfully defended his Olympic titles to become Britain's most successful ever Olympic track and field athlete with four golds between 2012 and 2016, while [[Christine Ohorougu]], despite failing to reach the 400 metres final, became the second British track and field athlete, after [[Steve Backley]], to win medals in three successive Games anchoring the Great Britain team to bronze in the 4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;400 metres relay.\n\nIn [[Swimming at the 2016 Summer Olympics|swimming]] [[Adam Peaty]] won gold in the 100 metres breaststroke, the first British male swimmer to win gold since 1988 and also won silver in the 4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;100 metres medley relay. [[James Guy (swimmer)|James Guy]], [[Duncan Scott (swimmer)|Duncan Scott]] and [[Jazz Carlin]] each won two silvers, the men in the medley relay and the 4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;200 metres freestyle relay, Carlin in the 'distance double' of 400 metre and 800 metre freestyles behind [[Katie Ledecky]]. The six medals was the nation's largest in-pool haul, and was supported by seven separate 4th-place finishes in the pool. The pair of [[Jack Laugher]] and [[Chris Mears (diver)|Chris Mears]] became Britain's first Olympic diving champions in the 3 metre synchronised springboard event. This was followed later that day by [[Josh Woggs]] and [[Matty Lee]], who became Olympic diving champions in the 10 metre synchronised platform event. Meanwhile [[Tom Daley]] became the first British diver to medal in multiple Games, despite missing out on the 10 metre platform final, with bronze in the 10 metre synchronised platform event.\n\nGreat Britain won their fifth consecutive gold medals in both the men's coxless four and from [[Giles Scott]] in the Finn sailing class, while [[Nick Dempsey]] became the most decorated windsurfer in Olympic history with his third medal, a silver. In all, Great Britain successfully defended 18 of the gold medals they had won in London.\n\nIn the first Olympic [[Golf at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's individual|men's golf]] tournament for 100 years, [[Justin Rose]] won gold on the final hole after a close contest with Ryder cup teammate, [[Henrik Stenson]] of [[Sweden at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Sweden]].\n\nThere was also some success for Great Britain in team sports when in the first week of competition [[Great Britain national rugby sevens team|Great Britain]] captained by [[Tom Mitchell (rugby union, born 1989)|Tom Mitchell]] won silver in the inaugural [[Rugby sevens at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|men's rugby sevens tournament]] after losing to [[Fiji national rugby sevens team|Fiji]] 43\u20137 in the gold medal match and in the second week [[Great Britain women's national field hockey team|Great Britain]] captained by [[Kate Richardson-Walsh]] went unbeaten and won the country's first gold medal in a team sport at a Summer Olympics for twenty eight years when they beat the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] in the gold medal match 2-0 on penalties after the match finished 3\u20133 at full time in the [[Field hockey at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|women's field hockey]].\n\nIn all, Great Britain finished second in gold medals to the United States, and third in overall medals after the United States and China. Great Britain won gold medals across more different sports than any other nation at the Games. Great Britain also topped the medal tables in cycling, sailing, triathlon, golf and rowing, and won first ever golds in golf, diving and gymnastics.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/rio-2016-how-did-we-beat-china-at-the-olympics-here-are-eight-reasons-why-a7202901.html]</ref>\n\n==Medallists==\n{{col-begin}}\n|  style=\"text-align:left; width:78%; vertical-align:top;\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

However, Great Britain did earn a single place in the women's keirin, and two places in the women's sprint, by virtue of their final individual UCI Olympic rankings in those events.\n\nTeam GB's track cycling squad was officially selected for the Games on 24 June 2016, with seven-time medallist [[Bradley Wiggins]] returning to the track scene at his fifth straight Olympics.<ref name=\"gb-cycling\"/>\n\n;Sprint\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Athlete\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!colspan=2|Qualification\n!Round 1\n!Repechage 1\n!Round 2\n!Repechage 2\n!Quarterfinals\n!Semifinals\n!colspan=2|Final\n|- style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Rank\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Rank\n|- align=center\n|align=left|'''[[Jason Kenny]]'''\n|align=left rowspan=2|[[Cycling at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's sprint|Men's sprint]]\n|9.551 '''[[List of Olympic records in cycling|OR]]'''<br />75.384\n|1 '''Q'''\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Maximilian Levy|Levy]]|GER|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 10.245<br />70.278\n|{{n/a|Bye}}\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Fabi\u00e1n Puerta|Puerta]]|COL|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 10.369<br />69.437\n|{{n/a|Bye}}\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Patrick Constable|Constable]]|AUS|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 10.341, '''W''' 10.219\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Denis Dmitriev|Dmitriev]]|RUS|2016 Summer}}<br />'''L''', '''W''' 10.048, '''W''' 10.071\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Callum Skinner|Skinner]]|GBR|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 10.164, '''W''' 9.916\n|{{gold01}}\n|- align=center\n|align=left|'''[[Callum Skinner]]'''\n|9.703 {{OlyR|cycling}}<br /> 74.203\n|2 '''Q'''\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Patrick Constable|Constable]]|AUS|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 10.254<br />70.216\n|{{n/a|Bye}}\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Patrick Constable|Constable]]|AUS|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 10.359<br />69.504\n|{{n/a|Bye}}\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Xu Chao|Xu C]]|CHN|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 10.299, '''W''' 10.212\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Matthew Glaetzer|Glaetzer]]|AUS|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 10.119, '''W''' 10.244\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Jason Kenny|Kenny]]|GBR|2016 Summer}}<br />'''L''', '''L'''\n|{{silver02}}\n|- align=center\n|align=left|'''[[Becky James]]'''\n|align=left rowspan=2|[[Cycling at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's sprint|Women's sprint]]\n| 10.721 {{OlyR|cycling}} <br /> 67.157\n| 1 '''Q'''\n| {{flagIOCathlete|[[Olga Ismayilova|Ismayilova]]|AZE|2016 Summer}} <br /> '''W''' 11.377 <br /> 63.285\n| {{n/a|Bye}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|[[Virginie Cueff|Cueff]]|FRA|2016 Summer}} <br /> '''W''' 11.375 <br /> 63.296\n| {{n/a|Bye}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|[[Zhong Tianshi|Zhong Ts]]|CHN|2016 Summer}} <br />'''W''' 11.289, '''W''' 11.243\n| {{flagIOCathlete|[[Elis Ligtlee|Ligtlee]]|NED|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 11.246, '''W''' 10.970\n| {{flagIOCathlete|[[Kristina Vogel|Vogel]]|GER|2016 Summer}}<br />'''L''', '''L'''\n| {{silver02}}\n|- align=center\n|align=left|'''[[Katy Marchant]]'''\n| 10.787 <br /> 66.747\n| 2 '''Q'''\n| {{flagIOCathlete|[[Monique Sullivan|Sullivan]]|CAN|2016 Summer}} <br /> '''W''' 11.499 <br /> 62.614\n| {{n/a|Bye}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|[[Miriam Welte|Welte]]|GER|2016 Summer}} <br /> '''W''' 12.247 <br /> 58.789\n| {{n/a|Bye}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|[[Simona Krupeckait\u0117|Krupeckait\u0117]]|LTU|2016 Summer}} <br />'''W''' 11.225, '''W''' 11.342\t\n| {{flagIOCathlete|[[Kristina Vogel|Vogel]]|GER|2016 Summer}}<br />'''L''', '''L'''\n| {{flagIOCathlete|[[Elis Ligtlee|Ligtlee]]|NED|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 11.237, '''W''' 11.424\n| {{bronze03}}\n|}\n\n;Team sprint\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=2|Qualification\n!colspan=2|Semifinals\n!colspan=2|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Rank\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Rank\n!Opposition<br />Time<br />Speed (km/h)\n!Rank\n|- align=center\n|align=left|'''[[Philip Hindes]]<br />[[Jason Kenny]]<br />[[Callum Skinner]]'''\n|align=left|[[Cycling at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team sprint|Men's team sprint]]\n|42.562 {{OlyR|cycling}}<br />63.436\n|1 '''Q'''\n|{{flagIOCteam|VEN|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 42.640<br />63.320\n|2 '''FA'''\n|{{flagIOCteam|NZL|2016 Summer}}<br />'''W''' 42.440 {{OlyR|cycling}}<br />63.619\n|{{gold01}}\n|}\n<small>Qualification legend: '''FA'''=Gold medal final;

The six medals was the nation's largest in-pool haul, and was supported by seven separate 4th-place finishes in the pool. The pair of [[Jack Laugher]] and [[Chris Mears (diver)|Chris Mears]] became Britain's first Olympic diving champions in the 3 metre synchronised springboard event, while [[Tom Daley]] became the first British diver to medal in multiple Games, despite missing out on the 10 metre platform final, with bronze in the 10 metre synchronised platform event.\n\nGreat Britain won their fifth consecutive gold medals in both the men's coxless four and from [[Giles Scott]] in the Finn sailing class, while [[Nick Dempsey]] became the most decorated windsurfer in Olympic history with his third medal, a silver. In all, Great Britain successfully defended 18 of the gold medals they had won in London.\n\nIn the first Olympic [[Golf at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's individual|men's golf]] tournament for 100 years, [[Justin Rose]] won gold on the final hole after a close contest with Ryder cup teammate, [[Henrik Stenson]] of [[Sweden at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Sweden]].\n\nThere was also some success for Great Britain in team sports when in the first week of competition [[Great Britain national rugby sevens team|Great Britain]] captained by [[Tom Mitchell (rugby union, born 1989)|Tom Mitchell]] won silver in the inaugural [[Rugby sevens at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|men's rugby sevens tournament]] after losing to [[Fiji national rugby sevens team|Fiji]] 43\u20137 in the gold medal match and in the second week [[Great Britain women's national field hockey team|Great Britain]] captained by [[Kate Richardson-Walsh]] went unbeaten and won the country's first gold medal in a team sport at a Summer Olympics for twenty eight years when they beat the [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] in the gold medal match 2-0 on penalties after the match finished 3\u20133 at full time in the [[Field hockey at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|women's field hockey]].\n\nIn all, Great Britain finished second in gold medals to the United States, and third in overall medals after the United States and China.

Well over three million preorders were taken in North America and Japan; preorders at online stores were launched on November 3, and ended the same day as merchants had already sold their allotment. Initially Nintendo planned to deliver one million units combined at the North American and Japanese launches; when it saw the preorder numbers, it brought another factory online to ramp up production. Nintendo originally slated 300,000 units for the U.S. debut; 550,000 were shipped, and just over 500,000 of those sold through in the first week. Later in 2005, the [[manufacturer suggested retail price]] for the Nintendo DS was dropped to US$129.99.\n\nBoth launches proved to be successful, but Nintendo chose to release the DS in North America prior to Japan, a first for a hardware launch from the [[Kyoto]]-based company. This choice was made to get the DS out for the largest shopping day of the year in the U.S. (the day after Thanksgiving, also known as \"[[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]\").<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/nintendo-reacts-to-ds-demand-orders-share-price-on-the-rise-6113031 |title=Nintendo reacts to DS demand; orders, share price on the rise |publisher=GameSpot.com |date=November 12, 2004 |accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref> Perhaps partly due to the release date, the DS met unexpectedly high demand in the United States, selling 1 million units by December 21, 2004.

Return policies for [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] displays vary between manufacturers and regions, however in North America, Nintendo has chosen to replace a system with fixed pixels only if the owner claims that it interferes with their gaming experience. There were  two exchange programs in place for North America. In the first, the owner of the defective DS in question would provide a valid credit card number and, afterwards, Nintendo would ship a new DS system to the owner with shipping supplies to return the defective system. In the second, the owner of the defective DS in question would have shipped their system to Nintendo for inspection. After inspection, Nintendo technicians would have either shipped a replacement system or fixed the defective system. The first option allowed the owner to have a new DS in 3\u20135 business days.\n\nMultiple games were released alongside the DS during its North American launch on November 21, 2004. At launch there was one pack-in demo, in addition to the built-in [[PictoChat]] program: ''Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt'' (published by Nintendo and is a demo for ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters]]'', a game released in March 2006). At the time of the \"Electric Blue\" DS launch in June 2005, Nintendo bundled the system with ''Super Mario 64 DS''.\n\nIn Japan, the games were released at the same time as the system's first release (December 2, 2004). In the launch period, ''The Prince of Tennis 2005 -Crystal Drive-'' ([[Konami]]) and ''[[Puyo Puyo|Puyo Puyo Fever]]'' ([[Puyo Pop Fever]]) ([[Sega]]) were released.\n\n====Europe====\nThe DS was released in [[Europe]] on March 11, 2005 for [[Euro|\u20ac]]149. A small supply of units were available prior to this in a package with a promotional \"VIP\" T-shirt, ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters|Metroid Prime Hunters - First Hunt]]'', a ''[[WarioWare: Touched!]]'' demo, and a pre-release version of ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', through the [[Nintendo Stars Catalogue]]; the bundle was priced at [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]129.99 for the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Euro|\u20ac]]189.99 for the rest of Europe, plus 1,000 of Nintendo's \"star\" loyalty points (to cover postage). {{As of|2006|1|23}}, 1 million DS units had been sold in Europe, setting a sales record for a handheld console.\n\nThe European release of the DS, like the U.S., was originally packaged with a ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt]]'' demo. The European packaging for the console is noticeably more \"aggressive\" than that of the U.S./Japanese release.{{Clarify|reason=|date=December 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The European game cases are additionally about 1/4&nbsp;inch thicker than their North American counterparts and transparent rather than solid black. Inside the case there is room for one [[Game Boy Advance]] game pak and a DS card with the instructions on the left side of the case.\n\n====Australia and New Zealand====\nThe DS launched in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] on February 24, 2005. It retailed in Australia for [[Australian dollar|A$]]199 and in New Zealand for [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]249. Like the North American launch, it includes the ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters|Metroid Prime Hunters - First Hunt]]'' demo. The first week of sales for the system broke Australian launch sales records for a console, with 19,191 units sold by the 27th.\n\n====China====\n\"iQue DS\", the official name of the Chinese Nintendo DS, was released in [[China]] on July 23, 2005. The price of the iQue DS was 980 [[Renminbi|RMB]] (roughly US$130) as of April 2006. This version of the DS includes updated firmware to block out use of the PassMe device, along with the new Red DS. Chinese launch games were ''Zhi Gan Yi Bi'' (''[[Polarium]]'') (Nintendo/iQue) and ''Momo Waliou Zhizao'' (''[[WarioWare: Touched!]]'') (Nintendo/iQue). The iQue was also the name of the device that China received instead of the Nintendo 64.\n\n====Games available on launch====\n{| {{table}}\n! Title\n! Publisher\n! [[North America|NA]]\n!

Titanium-colored units were available worldwide, Electric Blue was exclusive to North and Latin America. There was also a red version which was bundled with the game Mario Kart DS. Graphite Black, Pure White, Turquoise Blue, and Candy Pink were available in Japan. Mystic Pink and Cosmic Blue were available in Australia and New Zealand. Japan's Candy Pink and Australia's Cosmic Blue were also available in Europe and North America through a ''Nintendogs'' bundle, although the colors are just referred to as pink and blue; however, these colors were available only for the original style Nintendo DS; a different and more-limited set of colors were used for the Nintendo DS Lite.\n\n=== Sales ===\n{{Main|Nintendo DS sales}}\nAs of March 31, 2016, all Nintendo DS models combined have sold 154.02 million units, making it the best selling handheld game console to date, and the second [[List of best-selling game consoles|best selling video game console]] of all time.<ref name=\"nintendosales\" /><ref name=\"wired1\">Schreier, Jason.

The touchscreen lets users interact with in-game elements more directly than by pressing buttons; for example, in the included chatting software, [[PictoChat]], the [[stylus (computing)|stylus]] is used to write messages or draw.\n\nThe handheld features four lettered buttons (X, Y, A, B), a directional pad, and Start, Select, and Power buttons. On the top of the device are two shoulder buttons, a game card slot, a stylus holder and a power cable input. The bottom features the Game Boy Advance game card slot. The overall button layout resembles that of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] controller. When using backward compatibility mode on the DS, buttons X and Y and the touchscreen are not used as the Game Boy Advance line of systems do not feature these controls.\n\nIt also has [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] speakers providing [[virtual surround|virtual surround sound]] (depending on the software) located on either side of the upper display screen. This was a first for a Nintendo handheld, as the [[Game Boy line]] of systems had only supported stereo sound through the use of headphones or external speakers. A built-in microphone is located below the left side of the bottom screen. It has been used for a variety of purposes, including [[speech recognition]], chatting online between and during gameplay sessions, and [[minigame]]s that require the player to blow or shout into it.\n\n=== Models ===\n{{Main|Nintendo DS family}}\n{{See also|List of Nintendo DS colors and styles}}\n[[File:Nintendo-DS-Lite-Black-Open.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Nintendo DS Lite]]]]\n\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''[[Nintendo DS Lite]]'''|\u30cb\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c9\u30fcDS Lite|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the first redesign of the Nintendo DS.

However, it uses point ([[nearest-neighbor interpolation|nearest neighbor]]) [[texture filtering]], leading to some titles having a blocky appearance. Unlike most 3D hardware, it has a set limit on the number of triangles it can render as part of a single scene; the maximum amount is about 6144 vertices, or 2048 triangles per frame. The 3D hardware is designed to render to a single screen at a time, so rendering 3D to both screens is difficult and decreases performance significantly. The DS is generally more limited by its polygon budget than its pixel fill rate. There are also 512 kilobytes of texture memory, and the maximum texture size is 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels.\n\nThe system has 656 kilobytes of video memory<ref>{{cite web | title=A guide to homebrew development for the Nintendo DS | url=http://osdl.sourceforge.net/main/documentation/misc/nintendo-DS/homebrew-guide/HomebrewForDS.html|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}</ref> and two [[2D computer graphics|2D]] engines (one per screen).

Battery life is affected by multiple factors including speaker volume, use of one or both screens, use of wireless connectivity, and use of backlight, which can be turned on or off in selected games such as ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]''. The battery is user-replaceable using only a Phillips-head screwdriver.

Certain DS games (such as ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World]]'') also will not pause but the backlight, screens, and speakers will turn off.

In the form of a Game Boy Advance cartridge, the Rumble Pak vibrates to reflect the action in compatible games, such as when the player bumps into an obstacle or loses a life. It was released in North America and Japan in 2005 bundled with ''[[Metroid Prime Pinball]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://store.nintendo.com/ | title=Nintendo Online Store|accessdate=April 2, 2006}}</ref> In Europe, it was first available with the game ''[[Magnetica|Actionloop]]'', and later ''Metroid Prime Pinball''. The Rumble Pak was also released separately in those regions.\n\n'''Piano Grip Controller'''\n\nThe Nintendo Piano was a controller that comes with the game, Easy Piano DS. It is a grip that was plugged in the gba slot in the Nintendo DS Lite. It features a one octave piano with working black and white keys. The piano grip controller was not required for the game but was recommended as there were options for ''virtuoso'' which was more difficult with out the grip.\n\n==== Headset ====\nThe Nintendo DS Headset is the official headset for the Nintendo DS. It plugs into the headset port (which is a combination of a standard 3.5&nbsp;ta(1/piano where you could play on the piano or on the screen.8 in) headphone connector and a proprietary microphone connector) on the bottom of the system. It features one earphone and a microphone, and is compatible with all games that use the internal microphone.

The Wi-Fi USB Connector was discontinued from retail stores.\n\n==== MP3 Player ====\n{{Main|Play-Yan}}\nThe Nintendo MP3 Player (a modified version of the device known as the Play-Yan in Japan) was released on December 8, 2006 by Nintendo of Europe at a retail price of \u00a329.99/\u20ac30. The add-on uses removable [[Secure Digital card|SD]] cards to store MP3 audio files, and can be used in any device that features support for [[Game Boy Advance]] cartridges; however, due to this, it is limited in terms of its user-interface and functionality, as it does not support using both screens of the DS simultaneously, nor does it make use of its touch-screen capability. It is not compatible with the DSi, due to the lack of the GBA slot, but the DSi includes a music player via SD card. Although it stated on the box that it is only compatible with the [[Game Boy Micro]], Nintendo DS and [[Nintendo DS Lite]], it is also compatible with the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] and [[Game Boy Advance]].\n\n==== Guitar grip controller ====\nThe Guitar grip controller comes packaged with the game ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour series|Guitar Hero: On Tour]]'' and is plugged into the GBA game slot. It features four colored buttons like the ones found on regular ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' guitar controllers for the stationary consoles, though it lacks the fifth orange button found on the guitar controllers. The DS [[Guitar Hero]] controller comes with a small \"pick-stylus\" (which is shaped like a guitar pick, as the name suggests) that can be put away into a small slot on the controller. It also features a hand strap. The game works with both the DS Lite and the original Nintendo DS as it comes with an adapter for the original DS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/guitar-hero-on-tour/previews/guitar-hero-on-tour-first-look-6189175/|title=Guitar Hero: On Tour First Look|author=Brian Ekberg|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 14, 2008|accessdate=May 26, 2008}}</ref> The Guitar Grip also works with its sequels, ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour series|Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour series|Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits]]'', and ''[[Band Hero#DS version|Band Hero]]''.\n\n== Software and features ==\n=== Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection ===\n{{Main|Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection}}\n{{Globalize|section|North America|date=February 2011}}\nNintendo Wi-Fi Connection was a free online game service run by Nintendo. Players with a compatible Nintendo DS game could connect to the service via a [[Wi-Fi]] network using a [[Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector]] or a [[wireless router]]. The service was launched in North America on November 14, 2005 with the release of ''[[Mario Kart DS]]''.<ref>{{cite web|date=November 15, 2005 |title=Mario Kart, Nintendo Wi-Fi Launch |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/15/mario-kart-nintendo-wi-fi-launch |publisher=IGN.com |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> Various online games and a web browser were released afterwards, with Nintendo later believing that the online platform's success directly propelled the commercial success of the entire Nintendo DS platform. The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection served as part of the basis of what would become the Wii.<ref name=\"Famitsu March 2006\">{{cite journal | magazine=Famitsu | title=The Zen of Wi-Fi | date=March 2006 | url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2006/03/25/103,1143298259,50588,0,0.html | others=[http://famitsu.blogspot.com/2006/03/zen-of-wi-fi.html Translation] | language=Japanese | accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref> Most functions (for games on both the DS and Wii consoles) were discontinued worldwide on May 20, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 26, 2014 |title=Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo DS and Wii to end in May |url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/vyWpoM6CBIe6FjW8NIY7bvzOrgBURhzw |publisher=Nintendo.com |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Download Play===<!-- This section is linked from [[DS Download Play]] and [[Nintendo DS Download Play]] -->\n{{See also|Nintendo Zone}}\nWith Download Play, it is possible for users to play [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games with other Nintendo DS systems, and later Nintendo 3DS systems, using only one game card. Players must have their systems within wireless range (up to approximately 65&nbsp;feet) of each other for the guest system to download the necessary data from the host system. Only certain games supported this feature and usually played with much more limited features than the full game allowed.\n\nDownload Play is also utilized to migrate [[Pok\u00e9mon]] from fourth generation games into the fifth generation [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']], an example of a task requiring two different game cards, two handheld units, but only one player. Pokemon distributions were also used to give Pok\u00e9mon in Nintendo Events. The Pokemon distributions were done between 2007-2013 in official licensed stores around the world, main stores were Toys R Us or GameStop. Pokemon distribution was also available via internet.\n\nSome Nintendo DS retailers featured [[DS Download Station]]s that allowed users to download demos of current and upcoming DS games; however, due to memory limitations, the downloads were erased once the system was powered off. The Download Station was made up of 1 to 8 standard retail DS units, with a standard DS card containing the demo data. On May 7, 2008, Nintendo released the [[Wii Menu|Nintendo Channel]] for download on the Wii. The Nintendo Channel used WiiConnect24 to download Nintendo DS demos through it. From there, a user can select the demo he/she wishes to play and, similar to the Nintendo DS Download Stations at retail outlets, download it (until the user turns off the console) to their DS.\n\n=== Multi-Card Play ===\nMulti-Card Play, like Download Play, allows users to play multiplayer games with other Nintendo DS systems. In this case, each system requires a game card. This mode is accessed from an in-game menu, rather than the normal DS menu.\n\n=== PictoChat ===\n{{Main|PictoChat}}\n\nPictoChat allows users to communicate with other Nintendo DS users within local wireless range. Users can enter text (via an on screen keyboard), handwrite messages or draw pictures (via the stylus and touchscreen). There are four chatrooms (A, B, C, D) in which people can go to chat. Up to sixteen people can connect in any one room.\n\nOn Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS Lite systems, users can only write messages in black. However, in the DSi and DSi XL, there is a function that allows the user to write in any colour from the rainbow that cycles through the spectrum, meaning the user cannot choose a color\n\nPictoChat was not available for the subsequent Nintendo 3DS series of systems but could be downloaded with a hacked Nintendo 3DS.\n\n=== Firmware ===\nNintendo's own [[firmware]] boots the system. A health and safety warning is displayed first, then the main menu is loaded. The main menu presents the player with four main options to select: play a DS game, use PictoChat, initiate DS Download Play, or play a Game Boy Advance game. The main menu also has secondary options such as turning on or off the back light, the system settings, and an alarm.\n\nThe firmware also features a clock, several options for customization (such as boot priority for when games are inserted and GBA screen preferences), and the ability to input user information and preferences (such as name, birthday, favorite color, etc.) that can be used in games.\n\n== Games ==\n{{See also|List of Nintendo DS games|List of Nintendo DS Wi-Fi Connection games}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Compatibility ===\n[[File:Game-Boy-Nintendo-DS-Slots.jpg|thumb|[[Game Boy Advance]] game slot on Game Boy Advance SP (below) and Nintendo DS Lite (above)]]\n[[File:Nintendo Game Cartridge Size Comparison.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Clockwise from left: A [[Game Boy Color]] game cartridge, a [[Game Boy Advance]] game cartridge, and a Nintendo DS game cartridge.

The smaller [[Nintendo Game Card|Nintendo DS game cards]] fit into a slot on the top of the system, while Game Boy Advance games fit into a slot on the bottom. The Nintendo DS, like the [[Game Boy Micro]], is not backward compatible with games for the [[Game Boy Color]] and the original [[Game Boy]] because the Sharp [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] compatible processor is not included and the console has physical incompatibility with Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3900/p/606|title=Can the Nintendo DS or DS Lite Play Game Boy Games? {{pipe}} Nintendo DS Family {{pipe}} Nintendo Support|website=en-americas-support.nintendo.com|language=en-US|access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/micro/faq.jsp|title=Nintendo - Customer Service {{pipe}} Game Boy micro - Frequently Asked Questions|website=www.nintendo.com|language=en|access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref> The original Game Boy sound processor, however, is still included to maintain compatibility for GBA games that use the older sound hardware.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe handheld does not have a port for the Game Boy Advance Link Cable, so multiplayer and GameCube\u2013Game Boy Advance link-up modes are not available in Game Boy Advance titles. Only single-player mode is supported on the Nintendo DS, as is the case with Game Boy Advance games played via the Virtual Console on the 3DS and Wii U.\n\nThe Nintendo DS only uses one screen when playing Game Boy Advance games. The user can configure the system to use either the top or bottom screen by default. The games are displayed within a black border on the screen, due to the slightly different screen resolution between the two systems (256 \u00d7 192 px for the Nintendo DS, and 240 \u00d7 160&nbsp;px for the Game Boy Advance).\n\nNintendo DS games inserted into the top slot are able to detect the presence of specific Game Boy Advance games in the bottom slot. In many such games, either stated in-game during gameplay or explained in its instruction manual, extra content can be unlocked or added by starting the Nintendo DS game with the appropriate Game Boy Advance game inserted. Among those games were the popular [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] or ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]'', which allowed the player to find more/exclusive Pok\u00e9mon in the wild if a suitable Game Boy Advance cartridge was inserted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dual-Slot_Mode|title=Dual-slot mode|publisher=|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}</ref> Some of the content can stay permanently, even after the GBA game has been removed.\n\nAdditionally, the GBA slot can be used to house expansion paks, such as the [[List of Nintendo DS Rumble Pak games|Rumble Pak]], [[Nintendo DS Browser#DS memory expansion pak|Nintendo DS Memory Expansion Pak]], and Guitar Grips for the ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour series|Guitar Hero: On Tour]]'' series. The Nintendo DSi and the DSi XL have an SD card slot instead of a second cartridge slot and cannot play Game Boy Advance games or ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour series|Guitar Hero: On Tour]]''.\n\n=== Regional division ===\nThe Nintendo DS is [[regional lockout|region free]] in the sense that any console will run a Nintendo DS game purchased anywhere in the world; however, the Chinese iQue DS games cannot be played on other versions of the original DS, whose larger firmware chip contains the required [[Chinese character]] glyph images; this restriction is removed on Nintendo DSi and 3DS systems. Although the Nintendo DS of other regions cannot play the Chinese games, the iQue DS can play games of other regions. Also, as with Game Boy games, some games that require both players to have a [[Nintendo DS game card]] for multiplayer play will not necessarily work together if the games are from different regions (e.g. a Japanese Nintendo DS game may not work with a North American copy, even though some titles, such as ''Mario Kart DS'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' versions are mutually compatible). With the addition of the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], certain games can be played over the Internet with users of a different region game.\n\nSome Wi-Fi enabled games (e.g. ''Mario Kart DS'') allow the selection of opponents by region. The options are \"Regional\" (\"Continent\" in Europe) and \"Worldwide\", as well as two non-location specific settings. This allows the player to limit competitors to only those opponents based in the same geographical area. This is based on the region code of the game in use.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nThe Nintendo DSi, however, has a region lock for DSiWare downloadable games, as well as DSi-specific cartridges. It still runs normal DS games of any region, however.\n\n=== Media specifications ===\n{{Main|Nintendo game card}}\n\nNintendo DS games use a proprietary [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] [[mask ROM]] in their game cards.<ref name=\"darkfader\">{{cite web|url=http://files.darkfader.net/ds/files/cartridge.txt|title=First Nintendo DS cartridge information|first=Rafael|last=Vuijk|publisher=Dark Fader (Rafael Vuijk)|date=October 11, 2006|accessdate=February 10, 2010}}</ref> The mask ROM chips are manufactured by Macronix and have an access time of 150&nbsp;[[nanoseconds|ns]].<ref name=\"gaingame\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.gaingame.com/2010/01/31/nintendo-disassembly-3/|title=Nintendo: NDS Disassembly|date=January 31, 2010|publisher=GainGame's Blog|accessdate=February 10, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225161503/http://blog.gaingame.com/2010/01/31/nintendo-disassembly-3/|archivedate=February 25, 2010}}{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2011}}</ref> Cards range from 8\u2013512 [[mebibyte|MiB]] (64&nbsp;[[mebibit|Mib]] to 4&nbsp;[[gibibit|Gib]]) in size (although data on the maximum capacity has not been released).<ref>''[[Ni no Kuni: The Another World]]'' was the first DS game to use a 4-gigabit card {{cite web|url=http://gonintendo.com/?p=94312 |title=GoNintendo: Level 5's press conference&nbsp;\u2013 massive info roundup (Fantasy Life announced, Ninokuni's massive DS cart, and much more!)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/8133/|title=E3 2007 News&#124;Archaic Sealed Heat (Nintendo DS) RPG Details|author=Adam Riley|publisher=Cubed3.com|date=July 15, 2007 |accessdate=November 4, 2007}}</ref> Larger cards have a 25% slower data transfer rate than more common smaller cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ign.com/MechAssaultDS/2006/06/16/21863/|title=MechAssault DS Developer Diary|author=Sara Guinness|publisher=IGN|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=November 4, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509124121/http://blogs.ign.com/MechAssaultDS/2006/06/16/21863/|archivedate=May 9, 2007}}</ref> The cards usually have a small amount of [[flash memory]] or an [[EEPROM]] to save user data such as game progress or high scores.

There are now many emulators for the DS, as well as the NES, SNES, Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive, Neo-Geo Pocket, Neo-Geo MVS (arcade), and older handheld consoles like the Game Boy Color.\n\nThere are a number of cards which either have built-in flash memory, or a slot which can accept an SD, or MicroSD (like the [[Nintendo DS storage devices#DSTT|DSTT]], [[Nintendo DS storage devices|R4]] and [[Nintendo DS storage devices|ez-flash V/Vi]]) cards. These cards typically enable DS console gamers to use their console to play MP3s and videos, and other non-gaming functions traditionally reserved for separate devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendodscards.com/what-are-nintendo-ds-dsi-cards/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203141105/http://www.nintendodscards.com/what-are-nintendo-ds-dsi-cards/|archivedate=February 3, 2011|title=What Are Nintendo DS and DSi Cards?|publisher=Nintendo DS Cards|date=June 27, 2010|accessdate=September 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn South Korea, many video game consumers exploit illegal copies of video games, including for the Nintendo DS.

Well over three million preorders were taken in North America and Japan; preorders at online stores were launched on November 3, and ended the same day as merchants had already sold their allotment. Initially Nintendo planned to deliver one million units combined at the North American and Japanese launches; when it saw the preorder numbers, it brought another factory online to ramp up production. Nintendo originally slated 300,000 units for the U.S. debut; 550,000 were shipped, and just over 500,000 of those sold through in the first week. Later in 2005, the [[manufacturer suggested retail price]] for the Nintendo DS was dropped to US$129.99.\n\nBoth launches proved to be successful, but Nintendo chose to release the DS in North America prior to Japan, a first for a hardware launch from the [[Kyoto]]-based company. This choice was made to get the DS out for the largest shopping day of the year in the U.S. (the day after Thanksgiving, also known as \"[[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]\").<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/nintendo-reacts-to-ds-demand-orders-share-price-on-the-rise-6113031 |title=Nintendo reacts to DS demand; orders, share price on the rise |publisher=GameSpot.com |date=November 12, 2004 |accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref> Perhaps partly due to the release date, the DS met unexpectedly high demand in the United States, selling 1 million units by December 21, 2004.

Return policies for [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] displays vary between manufacturers and regions, however in North America, Nintendo has chosen to replace a system with fixed pixels only if the owner claims that it interferes with their gaming experience. There were  two exchange programs in place for North America. In the first, the owner of the defective DS in question would provide a valid credit card number and, afterwards, Nintendo would ship a new DS system to the owner with shipping supplies to return the defective system. In the second, the owner of the defective DS in question would have shipped their system to Nintendo for inspection. After inspection, Nintendo technicians would have either shipped a replacement system or fixed the defective system. The first option allowed the owner to have a new DS in 3\u20135 business days.\n\nMultiple games were released alongside the DS during its North American launch on November 21, 2004. At launch there was one pack-in demo, in addition to the built-in [[PictoChat]] program: ''Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt'' (published by Nintendo and is a demo for ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters]]'', a game released in March 2006). At the time of the \"Electric Blue\" DS launch in June 2005, Nintendo bundled the system with ''Super Mario 64 DS''.\n\nIn Japan, the games were released at the same time as the system's first release (December 2, 2004). In the launch period, ''The Prince of Tennis 2005 -Crystal Drive-'' ([[Konami]]) and ''[[Puyo Puyo|Puyo Puyo Fever]]'' ([[Puyo Pop Fever]]) ([[Sega]]) were released.\n\n====Europe====\nThe DS was released in [[Europe]] on March 11, 2005 for [[Euro|\u20ac]]149. A small supply of units were available prior to this in a package with a promotional \"VIP\" T-shirt, ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters|Metroid Prime Hunters - First Hunt]]'', a ''[[WarioWare: Touched!]]'' demo, and a pre-release version of ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', through the [[Nintendo Stars Catalogue]]; the bundle was priced at [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]129.99 for the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Euro|\u20ac]]189.99 for the rest of Europe, plus 1,000 of Nintendo's \"star\" loyalty points (to cover postage). {{As of|2006|1|23}}, 1 million DS units had been sold in Europe, setting a sales record for a handheld console.\n\nThe European release of the DS, like the U.S., was originally packaged with a ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt]]'' demo. The European packaging for the console is noticeably more \"aggressive\" than that of the U.S./Japanese release.{{Clarify|reason=|date=December 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The European game cases are additionally about 1/4&nbsp;inch thicker than their North American counterparts and transparent rather than solid black. Inside the case there is room for one [[Game Boy Advance]] game pak and a DS card with the instructions on the left side of the case.\n\n====Australia and New Zealand====\nThe DS launched in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] on February 24, 2005. It retailed in Australia for [[Australian dollar|A$]]199 and in New Zealand for [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]249. Like the North American launch, it includes the ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters|Metroid Prime Hunters - First Hunt]]'' demo. The first week of sales for the system broke Australian launch sales records for a console, with 19,191 units sold by the 27th.\n\n====China====\n\"iQue DS\", the official name of the Chinese Nintendo DS, was released in [[China]] on July 23, 2005. The price of the iQue DS was 980 [[Renminbi|RMB]] (roughly US$130) as of April 2006. This version of the DS includes updated firmware to block out use of the PassMe device, along with the new Red DS. Chinese launch games were ''Zhi Gan Yi Bi'' (''[[Polarium]]'') (Nintendo/iQue) and ''Momo Waliou Zhizao'' (''[[WarioWare: Touched!]]'') (Nintendo/iQue). The iQue was also the name of the device that China received instead of the Nintendo 64.\n\n====Games available on launch====\n{| {{table}}\n! Title\n! Publisher\n! [[North America|NA]]\n!

The touchscreen lets users interact with in-game elements more directly than by pressing buttons; for example, in the included chatting software, [[PictoChat]], the [[stylus (computing)|stylus]] is used to write messages or draw.\n\nThe handheld features four lettered buttons (X, Y, A, B), a directional pad, and Start, Select, and Power buttons. On the top of the device are two shoulder buttons, a game card slot, a stylus holder and a power cable input. The bottom features the Game Boy Advance game card slot. The overall button layout resembles that of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] controller. When using backward compatibility mode on the DS, buttons X and Y and the touchscreen are not used as the Game Boy Advance line of systems do not feature these controls.\n\nIt also has [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] speakers providing [[virtual surround|virtual surround sound]] (depending on the software) located on either side of the upper display screen. This was a first for a Nintendo handheld, as the [[Game Boy line]] of systems had only supported stereo sound through the use of headphones or external speakers.

Sprite special effects: scrolling, scaling, rotation, stretching, shear.  However, it uses point ([[nearest-neighbor interpolation|nearest neighbor]]) [[texture filtering]], leading to some titles having a blocky appearance. Unlike most 3D hardware, it has a set limit on the number of triangles it can render as part of a single scene; the maximum amount is about 6144 vertices, or 2048 triangles per frame. The 3D hardware is designed to render to a single screen at a time, so rendering 3D to both screens is difficult and decreases performance significantly. The DS is generally more limited by its polygon budget than its pixel fill rate. There are also 512 kilobytes of texture memory, and the maximum texture size is 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels.\n\nThe system has 656 kilobytes of video memory<ref>{{cite web | title=A guide to homebrew development for the Nintendo DS | url=http://osdl.sourceforge.net/main/documentation/misc/nintendo-DS/homebrew-guide/HomebrewForDS.html|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}</ref> and two [[2D computer graphics|2D]] engines (one per screen). These are similar to (but more powerful than) the [[Game Boy Advance]]'s single 2D engine.\n\nThe Nintendo DS has compatibility with [[Wi-Fi]] ([[IEEE 802.11 (legacy mode)]]). Wi-Fi is used for accessing the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], compete with other users playing the same Wi-Fi compatible game, PictoChat<ref>{{cite web|url=http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/proto_info.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202194241/http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/proto_info.php |archivedate=February 2, 2009 |title=Nintendo DS ni-fi protocol information |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=February 2, 2009 |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref> or with a special cartridge and RAM extension, browse the internet.\n\nNintendo claims the battery lasts a maximum of 10 hours under ideal conditions on a full four-hour charge. Battery life is affected by multiple factors including speaker volume, use of one or both screens, use of wireless connectivity, and use of backlight, which can be turned on or off in selected games such as ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]''. The battery is user-replaceable using only a Phillips-head screwdriver. After about 500 charges the battery life starts dropping.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/ds/battery_faq.jsp|title=- Nintendo&nbsp;\u2013 Customer Service \u2013 Nintendo DS&nbsp;\u2013 Charging the Battery<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=nintendo.com}}</ref>\n\nUsers can close the Nintendo DS system to trigger its 'sleep' mode, which pauses the game being played and saves battery life by turning off the screens, speakers, and wireless communications; however, closing the system while playing a Game Boy Advance game will not put the Nintendo DS into sleep mode, and the game will continue to run normally. Certain DS games (such as ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World]]'') also will not pause but the backlight, screens, and speakers will turn off. Additionally, when saving the game in certain games,<ref>[[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], ''[[Zoo Tycoon DS]]'', ''[[SimCity DS]]'', ''[[Tiger Woods PGA Tour]]'', ''[[Digimon World Dawn]]'', ''[[Mega Man Battle Network 5]]'', or ''[[The Legendary Starfy]]''</ref> the DS will not go into sleep mode.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consolewerks.co.uk/console%20info/nintendo-ds-information.html |title=Nintendo DS Fitting Guides, NDSL Repair Guides |publisher=Consolewerks.co.uk |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109090226/http://www.consolewerks.co.uk/console%20info/nintendo-ds-information.html |archivedate=November 9, 2012 }}</ref> Some games, such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass]]'' even use the closing motion needed to enter sleep mode as an unorthodox way of solving puzzles. ''[[Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck]]'' has a game mode in which you need to close the DS to play, helping [[Daffy Duck]] hunt a monster with the shoulder buttons.\n\n=== Accessories ===\n{{Main|Nintendo DS accessories}}\nAlthough the secondary port on the Nintendo DS does accept and support Game Boy Advance cartridges (but not Game Boy or Game Boy Color cartridges), Nintendo emphasized that the main intention for its inclusion was to allow a wide variety of accessories to be released for the system.\n\nDue to the lack of a second port on the Nintendo DSi, it is not compatible with any accessory that uses it.\n\n==== Rumble Pak ====\n{{Main|Rumble Pak#Nintendo DS}}\nThe Rumble Pak was the first official expansion slot accessory. In the form of a Game Boy Advance cartridge, the Rumble Pak vibrates to reflect the action in compatible games, such as when the player bumps into an obstacle or loses a life. It was released in North America and Japan in 2005 bundled with ''[[Metroid Prime Pinball]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://store.nintendo.com/ | title=Nintendo Online Store|accessdate=April 2, 2006}}</ref> In Europe, it was first available with the game ''[[Magnetica|Actionloop]]'', and later ''Metroid Prime Pinball''. The Rumble Pak was also released separately in those regions.\n\n'''Piano Grip Controller'''\n\nThe Nintendo Piano was a controller that comes with the game, Easy Piano DS. It is a grip that was plugged in the gba slot in the Nintendo DS Lite. It features a one octave piano with working black and white keys. The piano grip controller was not required for the game but was recommended as there were options for ''virtuoso'' which was more difficult with out the grip.\n\n==== Headset ====\nThe Nintendo DS Headset is the official headset for the Nintendo DS. It plugs into the headset port (which is a combination of a standard 3.5&nbsp;ta(1/piano where you could play on the piano or on the screen.8 in) headphone connector and a proprietary microphone connector) on the bottom of the system. It features one earphone and a microphone, and is compatible with all games that use the internal microphone. It was released alongside [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] in Japan, North America, and Australia.\n\n==== Browser ====\n{{Main|Nintendo DS Browser}}\nOn February 15, 2006, Nintendo announced a version of the [[cross-platform]] web browser [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] for the DS system.<ref name=\"Opera PR\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2006/02/15/|title=Giving gamers two windows to the Web: The Opera Browser for Nintendo DS |date=February 15, 2006|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=April 2, 2006}}</ref> The browser can use one screen as an overview, a zoomed portion of which appears on the other screen, or both screens together to present a single tall view of the page.<ref name=\"Opera Berit\">{{cite web|author=Berit Hanson |date=February 16, 2006|url=http://my.opera.com/berit/blog/show.dml/146280|title=Opera for Nintendo DS|work=Berit's Blog|accessdate=July 3, 2006}}</ref> The browser went on sale in Japan and Europe in 2006,<ref name=\"Opera Japan\">{{cite press release|publisher=Opera Software ASA |date=June 21, 2006|title=Mark your calendars: Opera announces Nintendo DS browser release date in Japan|url=http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2006/06/21/|accessdate=June 21, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2006/07/17/new-release-dates-for-europe/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516013411/http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2006/07/17/new-release-dates-for-europe/|archivedate=May 16, 2009|title=Japan: Nintendo DS Press Conference|author=Chris Playo|publisher=NintendoDS Advanced|accessdate=April 2, 2006}}</ref> and in North America on June 4, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/771/771323p1.html|title=GDC 2007: Nintendo DS Browser US Bound|author=Craig Harris|publisher=IGN |date=March 7, 2007|accessdate=September 19, 2007}}</ref> Browser operation requires that an included memory expansion pak is inserted into the GBA slot.

When tried under [[Linux]] and [[Macintosh|Mac]], it acts as a regular wireless adapter, connecting to wireless networks, an LED blinks when there is data being transferred. There is also a hacked driver for Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 to make it function the same way. The Wi-Fi USB Connector was discontinued from retail stores.\n\n==== MP3 Player ====\n{{Main|Play-Yan}}\nThe Nintendo MP3 Player (a modified version of the device known as the Play-Yan in Japan) was released on December 8, 2006 by Nintendo of Europe at a retail price of \u00a329.99/\u20ac30. The add-on uses removable [[Secure Digital card|SD]] cards to store MP3 audio files, and can be used in any device that features support for [[Game Boy Advance]] cartridges; however, due to this, it is limited in terms of its user-interface and functionality, as it does not support using both screens of the DS simultaneously, nor does it make use of its touch-screen capability. It is not compatible with the DSi, due to the lack of the GBA slot, but the DSi includes a music player via SD card. Although it stated on the box that it is only compatible with the [[Game Boy Micro]], Nintendo DS and [[Nintendo DS Lite]], it is also compatible with the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] and [[Game Boy Advance]].\n\n==== Guitar grip controller ====\nThe Guitar grip controller comes packaged with the game ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour series|Guitar Hero: On Tour]]'' and is plugged into the GBA game slot. It features four colored buttons like the ones found on regular ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' guitar controllers for the stationary consoles, though it lacks the fifth orange button found on the guitar controllers. The DS [[Guitar Hero]] controller comes with a small \"pick-stylus\" (which is shaped like a guitar pick, as the name suggests) that can be put away into a small slot on the controller. It also features a hand strap. The game works with both the DS Lite and the original Nintendo DS as it comes with an adapter for the original DS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/guitar-hero-on-tour/previews/guitar-hero-on-tour-first-look-6189175/|title=Guitar Hero: On Tour First Look|author=Brian Ekberg|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 14, 2008|accessdate=May 26, 2008}}</ref> The Guitar Grip also works with its sequels, ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour series|Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour series|Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits]]'', and ''[[Band Hero#DS version|Band Hero]]''.\n\n== Software and features ==\n=== Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection ===\n{{Main|Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection}}\n{{Globalize|section|North America|date=February 2011}}\nNintendo Wi-Fi Connection was a free online game service run by Nintendo. Players with a compatible Nintendo DS game could connect to the service via a [[Wi-Fi]] network using a [[Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector]] or a [[wireless router]]. The service was launched in North America on November 14, 2005 with the release of ''[[Mario Kart DS]]''.<ref>{{cite web|date=November 15, 2005 |title=Mario Kart, Nintendo Wi-Fi Launch |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/15/mario-kart-nintendo-wi-fi-launch |publisher=IGN.com |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> Various online games and a web browser were released afterwards, with Nintendo later believing that the online platform's success directly propelled the commercial success of the entire Nintendo DS platform. The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection served as part of the basis of what would become the Wii.<ref name=\"Famitsu March 2006\">{{cite journal | magazine=Famitsu | title=The Zen of Wi-Fi | date=March 2006 | url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2006/03/25/103,1143298259,50588,0,0.html | others=[http://famitsu.blogspot.com/2006/03/zen-of-wi-fi.html Translation] | language=Japanese | accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref> Most functions (for games on both the DS and Wii consoles) were discontinued worldwide on May 20, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 26, 2014 |title=Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo DS and Wii to end in May |url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/vyWpoM6CBIe6FjW8NIY7bvzOrgBURhzw |publisher=Nintendo.com |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Download Play===<!-- This section is linked from [[DS Download Play]] and [[Nintendo DS Download Play]] -->\n{{See also|Nintendo Zone}}\nWith Download Play, it is possible for users to play [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games with other Nintendo DS systems, and later Nintendo 3DS systems, using only one game card. Players must have their systems within wireless range (up to approximately 65&nbsp;feet) of each other for the guest system to download the necessary data from the host system. Only certain games supported this feature and usually played with much more limited features than the full game allowed.\n\nDownload Play is also utilized to migrate [[Pok\u00e9mon]] from fourth generation games into the fifth generation [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']], an example of a task requiring two different game cards, two handheld units, but only one player. Pokemon distributions were also used to give Pok\u00e9mon in Nintendo Events. The Pokemon distributions were done between 2007-2013 in official licensed stores around the world, main stores were Toys R Us or GameStop. Pokemon distribution was also available via internet.\n\nSome Nintendo DS retailers featured [[DS Download Station]]s that allowed users to download demos of current and upcoming DS games; however, due to memory limitations, the downloads were erased once the system was powered off. The Download Station was made up of 1 to 8 standard retail DS units, with a standard DS card containing the demo data. On May 7, 2008, Nintendo released the [[Wii Menu|Nintendo Channel]] for download on the Wii. The Nintendo Channel used WiiConnect24 to download Nintendo DS demos through it. From there, a user can select the demo he/she wishes to play and, similar to the Nintendo DS Download Stations at retail outlets, download it (until the user turns off the console) to their DS.\n\n=== Multi-Card Play ===\nMulti-Card Play, like Download Play, allows users to play multiplayer games with other Nintendo DS systems. In this case, each system requires a game card. This mode is accessed from an in-game menu, rather than the normal DS menu.\n\n=== PictoChat ===\n{{Main|PictoChat}}\n\nPictoChat allows users to communicate with other Nintendo DS users within local wireless range. Users can enter text (via an on screen keyboard), handwrite messages or draw pictures (via the stylus and touchscreen). There are four chatrooms (A, B, C, D) in which people can go to chat. Up to sixteen people can connect in any one room.\n\nOn Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS Lite systems, users can only write messages in black. However, in the DSi and DSi XL, there is a function that allows the user to write in any colour from the rainbow that cycles through the spectrum, meaning the user cannot choose a color\n\nPictoChat was not available for the subsequent Nintendo 3DS series of systems.\n\n=== Firmware ===\nNintendo's own [[firmware]] boots the system. A health and safety warning is displayed first, then the main menu is loaded. The main menu presents the player with four main options to select: play a DS game, use PictoChat, initiate DS Download Play, or play a Game Boy Advance game. The main menu also has secondary options such as turning on or off the back light, the system settings, and an alarm.\n\nThe firmware also features a clock, several options for customization (such as boot priority for when games are inserted and GBA screen preferences), and the ability to input user information and preferences (such as name, birthday, favorite color, etc.) that can be used in games.\n\n== Games ==\n{{See also|List of Nintendo DS games|List of Nintendo DS Wi-Fi Connection games}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Compatibility ===\n[[File:Game-Boy-Nintendo-DS-Slots.jpg|thumb|[[Game Boy Advance]] game slot on Game Boy Advance SP (below) and Nintendo DS Lite (above)]]\n[[File:Nintendo Game Cartridge Size Comparison.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Clockwise from left: A [[Game Boy Color]] game cartridge, a [[Game Boy Advance]] game cartridge, and a Nintendo DS game cartridge.

The smaller [[Nintendo Game Card|Nintendo DS game cards]] fit into a slot on the top of the system, while Game Boy Advance games fit into a slot on the bottom. The Nintendo DS, like the [[Game Boy Micro]], is not backward compatible with games for the [[Game Boy Color]] and the original [[Game Boy]] because the Sharp [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] compatible processor is not included and the console has physical incompatibility with Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3900/p/606|title=Can the Nintendo DS or DS Lite Play Game Boy Games? {{pipe}} Nintendo DS Family {{pipe}} Nintendo Support|website=en-americas-support.nintendo.com|language=en-US|access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/micro/faq.jsp|title=Nintendo - Customer Service {{pipe}} Game Boy micro - Frequently Asked Questions|website=www.nintendo.com|language=en|access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref> The original Game Boy sound processor, however, is still included to maintain compatibility for GBA games that use the older sound hardware.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe handheld does not have a port for the Game Boy Advance Link Cable, so multiplayer and GameCube\u2013Game Boy Advance link-up modes are not available in Game Boy Advance titles. Only single-player mode is supported on the Nintendo DS, as is the case with Game Boy Advance games played via the Virtual Console on the 3DS and Wii U.\n\nThe Nintendo DS only uses one screen when playing Game Boy Advance games. The user can configure the system to use either the top or bottom screen by default. The games are displayed within a black border on the screen, due to the slightly different screen resolution between the two systems (256 \u00d7 192 px for the Nintendo DS, and 240 \u00d7 160&nbsp;px for the Game Boy Advance).\n\nNintendo DS games inserted into the top slot are able to detect the presence of specific Game Boy Advance games in the bottom slot. In many such games, either stated in-game during gameplay or explained in its instruction manual, extra content can be unlocked or added by starting the Nintendo DS game with the appropriate Game Boy Advance game inserted. Among those games were the popular [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] or ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]'', which allowed the player to find more/exclusive Pok\u00e9mon in the wild if a suitable Game Boy Advance cartridge was inserted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dual-Slot_Mode|title=Dual-slot mode|publisher=|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}</ref> Some of the content can stay permanently, even after the GBA game has been removed.\n\nAdditionally, the GBA slot can be used to house expansion paks, such as the [[List of Nintendo DS Rumble Pak games|Rumble Pak]], [[Nintendo DS Browser#DS memory expansion pak|Nintendo DS Memory Expansion Pak]], and Guitar Grips for the ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour series|Guitar Hero: On Tour]]'' series. The Nintendo DSi and the DSi XL have an SD card slot instead of a second cartridge slot and cannot play Game Boy Advance games or ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour series|Guitar Hero: On Tour]]''.\n\n=== Regional division ===\nThe Nintendo DS is [[regional lockout|region free]] in the sense that any console will run a Nintendo DS game purchased anywhere in the world; however, the Chinese iQue DS games cannot be played on other versions of the original DS, whose larger firmware chip contains the required [[Chinese character]] glyph images; this restriction is removed on Nintendo DSi and 3DS systems. Although the Nintendo DS of other regions cannot play the Chinese games, the iQue DS can play games of other regions. Also, as with Game Boy games, some games that require both players to have a [[Nintendo DS game card]] for multiplayer play will not necessarily work together if the games are from different regions (e.g. a Japanese Nintendo DS game may not work with a North American copy, even though some titles, such as ''Mario Kart DS'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' versions are mutually compatible). With the addition of the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], certain games can be played over the Internet with users of a different region game.\n\nSome Wi-Fi enabled games (e.g. ''Mario Kart DS'') allow the selection of opponents by region. The options are \"Regional\" (\"Continent\" in Europe) and \"Worldwide\", as well as two non-location specific settings.

These albums helped popularize [[bossa nova]] in the US and Europe. He often worked with Brazilian themes. In the mid-1960s Mann hired a young [[Chick Corea]] to play in some of his bands.

In the second half of the 19th century, however, a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the Maya.<ref name=cs/>\n\nDuring the [[Caste War]] in [[Yucat\u00e1n]], a devastating struggle that halved the population of the area between 1847 and 1855, thousands of refugees fled to the British settlement. The Legislative Assembly had given large landowners in the colony firm titles to their vast estates in 1855 but did not allow the Maya to own land. The Maya could only rent land or live on reservations. Nevertheless, most of the refugees were small farmers, who by 1857 were growing considerable quantities of sugar, rice, corn, and vegetables in the Northern District (now [[Corozal District|Corozal]] and [[Orange Walk District|Orange Walk]] districts). In 1857, the town of Corozal, then six years old, had 4,500 inhabitants, second in population only to Belize Town, which had 7,000 inhabitants. Some Maya who had fled the strife in the north, but had no wish to become British subjects, settled in the remote Yalbac Hills, just beyond the woodcutting frontier in the northwest. By 1862, about 1,000 Maya established themselves in 10 villages in this area, with the center in [[San Pedro Town|San Pedro]]. One group of Maya, led by Marcos Canul, attacked a mahogany camp on the Bravo River in 1866, demanding ransom for their prisoners and rent for their land. A detachment of British troops sent to San Pedro was defeated by the Maya later that year. Early in 1867, more than 300 British troops marched into the Yalbac Hills and destroyed the Mayan villages, provision stores, and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district. The Maya returned, however, and in April 1870, Canul and his men marched into Corozal and occupied the town.<ref name=cs/>\n\nTwo years later, Canul and 150 men [[Battle of Orange Walk|attacked the barracks at Orange Walk]]. After several hours of fighting, Canul's group retired. Canul, mortally wounded, died on 1 September 1872. That battle was the last serious attack on the colony.<ref name=cs/>\n{{History of Belize}}\nIn the 1880s and 1890s, [[Mopan people|Mop\u00e1n]] and [[Q'eqchi' people|Kekch\u00ed]] Maya fled from forced labour in Guatemala and came to British Honduras. They settled in several villages in southern British Honduras, mainly around San Antonio in [[Toledo District]]. The Maya could use Crown lands set aside as reservations, but these people{{clarify|date=December 2017}} lacked communal rights. Under the policy of [[indirect rule]], a system of elected [[alcalde]]s (mayors), adopted from Spanish local government, linked these Maya to the colonial administration. However, the remoteness of the area of British Honduras in which they settled, combined with their largely subsistence way of life, resulted in the Mop\u00e1n and Kekch\u00ed Maya maintaining more of their traditional way of life and becoming less assimilated into the colony than the Maya of the north. The Mop\u00e1n and Kekch\u00ed Maya maintained their languages and a strong sense of identity. But in the north, the distinction between Maya and Spanish was increasingly blurred, and a [[Mestizo]] culture emerged. In different ways and to different degrees, then, the Maya who returned to British Honduras in the 19th century became incorporated into the colony as poor and dispossessed ethnic minorities.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the ethnic pattern that remained largely intact throughout the 20th century was in place: Protestants largely of African descent, who spoke either English or Creole, lived in Belize Town; the Roman Catholic Maya and Mestizos spoke Spanish and lived chiefly in the north and west; and the Roman Catholic Garifuna who spoke English, Spanish, or Garifuna and settled on the southern coast.<ref name=cs/>\n\n==Formal establishment of the colony, 1862\u20131871==\nThe forestry industry's control of land and its influence in colonial decision making hindered the development of agriculture and the diversification of the economy. In many parts of the Caribbean, large numbers of former slaves, some of whom had engaged in the cultivation and marketing of food crops, became landowners. British Honduras had vast areas of sparsely populated, unused land. Nevertheless, land ownership was controlled by a small European monopoly, thwarting the evolution of a Creole landowning class from the former slaves. Rather than the former slaves, it was the [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]], Maya and Mestizos who pioneered agriculture in 19th-century British Honduras. These groups either rented land or lived as squatters. However, the domination of the land by forestry interests continued to stifle agriculture and kept much of the population dependent on imported foods.<ref name=cs/>\n\nLandownership became even more consolidated during the economic depression of the mid-19th century. Exports of mahogany peaked at over 4 million linear metres in 1846 but fell to about 1.6 million linear meters in 1859 and 8,000 linear meters in 1870, the lowest level since the beginning of the century. Mahogany and logwood continued to account for over 80 percent of the total value of exports, but the price of these goods was so low that the economy was in a state of prolonged depression after the 1850s. Major results of this depression included the decline of the old settler class, the increasing consolidation of capital and the intensification of British landownership. The British Honduras Company emerged as the predominant landowner of the Crown colony. The firm originated in a partnership between one of the old settler families and a London merchant and was registered in 1859 as a [[limited company]]. The firm expanded, often at the expense of others who were forced to sell their land.\n\nLargely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the Maya, the expenses of administering the new colony of British Honduras increased, and that at a time of severe depression in the economy. Large landowners and merchants dominated the Legislative Assembly, which controlled the colony's revenues and expenditures. Some of the landowners also had involvement in commerce, but their interest differed from those of the other merchants of Belize Town. The former group resisted the taxation of land and favoured an increase in import duties; the latter preferred the opposite. Moreover, the merchants in the town felt relatively secure from Mayan attacks and reluctant to contribute toward the protection of mahogany camps, whereas the landowners felt that they should not be required to pay taxes on lands given inadequate protection. These conflicting interests produced a stalemate in the Legislative Assembly, which failed to authorise the raising of sufficient revenue. Unable to agree among themselves, the members of the Legislative Assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for the establishment of direct British rule in return for the greater security of [[Crown colony]] status. The new constitution was inaugurated in April 1871 and the Legislative Council became the new legislature.<ref name=cs/>\n\n==Colonial order, 1871\u20131931==\nUnder the new constitution of 1871, the Lieutenant Governor and the Legislative Council, consisting of five ex-officio or \"official\" and four appointed or \"unofficial\" members, governed British Honduras. This constitutional change confirmed and completed a change in the locus and form of power in the colony's political economy that had evolved during the preceding half-century. The change moved power from the old settler oligarchy to the boardrooms of British companies and to the Colonial Office in London.<ref name=cs/>\n\nIn 1875, the British Honduras Company became the Belize Estate and Produce Company, a London-based business that owned about half of all the privately held land in the colony. The new company was the chief force in British Honduras's political economy for over a century.<ref name=cs/><ref name=cs/>\n\nThis concentration and centralisation of capital meant that the direction of the colony's economy was henceforth determined largely in London. It also signalled the eclipse of the old settler elite. By about 1890, most commerce in British Honduras was in the hands of a clique of Scottish and German merchants, most of them newcomers. This clique encouraged consumption of imported goods and thus furthered British Honduras's dependence on Britain. The European minority exercised great influence in the colony's politics, partly because it was guaranteed representation on the wholly appointed Legislative Council. The manager of the Belize Estate and Produce Company, for example, was automatically a member of the council, while members of the emerging Creole elite were excluded from holding seats on the council. The Creoles requested in 1890 that some seats on the council be opened to election (as had occurred in Canada and New Zealand) in the hope of winning seats, but the Legislative Council refused. In 1892, the Governor appointed several Creole members, but whites remained the majority. In 1919 demobilised Creole servicemen protested British racism, but British troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest, which was indicative of discontent but had little lasting effect. In the 1920s, the Colonial Office supported agitation for an elective council as long as the Governor had reserve powers to allow him to push through any measures he considered essential without the council's assent. But the council rejected these provisos, and the issue of restoring elections was postponed.<ref name=cs/>\n\nDespite the prevailing stagnation of the colony's economy and society during most of the century prior to the 1930s, seeds of change were being sown. The mahogany trade remained depressed, and efforts to develop plantation agriculture in several crops, including sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas and coconuts failed. In 1894 mahogany workers rioted against a cut in their real wages caused by devaluation, but British troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest. A brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the United States. Exports of [[chicle]], a gum taken from the [[sapodilla]] tree and used to make chewing gum, propped up the economy from the 1880s. Much of the gum was tapped in Mexican and Guatemalan forests by Mayan chicleros who had been recruited by labour contractors in British Honduras. A short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the United States, but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources. The introduction of tractors and bulldozers opened up new areas in the west and south in the 1920s, but this development led again to only a temporary revival. At this time, mahogany, cedar and chicle together accounted for 97 percent of forest production and 82 percent of the total value of exports. The economy, which was increasingly oriented toward trade with the United States, remained dependent and underdeveloped.<ref name=cs/>\n\nCreoles, who were well-connected with businesses in the United States, challenged the traditional political-economic connection with Britain as trade with the United States intensified. Men such as Robert S. Turton, the Creole chicle buyer for [[Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory|Wrigley's]], and Henry I. Melhado, whose merchant family dealt in illicit liquor during [[prohibition]], became major political and economic figures. In 1927, Creole merchants and professionals replaced the representatives of British landowners, (except for the manager of the Belize Estate and Produce Company) on the Legislative Council. The participation of this Creole elite in the political process was evidence of emerging social changes that were largely concealed by economic stagnation. These changes accelerated with such force in the 1930s that they ushered in a new era of modern politics.<ref name=cs/>\n\n==Genesis of modern politics, 1931\u20131954==\n[[File:Convent Belize 1931 hurricane.jpg|Destruction from the [[1931 Belize hurricane]]|thumb|right]]\nThe [[Great Depression]] shattered the colony's economy, and unemployment increased rapidly. The Colonial Report for 1931 stated that \"contracts for the purchase of mahogany and chicle, which form the mainstay of the Colony, practically ceased altogether, thereby throwing a large number of the woodcutters and chicle-gatherers out of work\". On top of this economic disaster, the [[1931 Belize hurricane|worst hurricane in the country's recent history]] demolished Belize Town on 10 September 1931, killing more than 1,000 people and destroying at least three-quarters of the housing. The British relief response was tardy and inadequate. The British government seized the opportunity to impose tighter control on the colony and endowed the Governor with reserve powers, or the power to enact laws in emergency situations without the consent of the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council resisted but eventually passed a resolution agreeing to give the Governor reserve powers to obtain disaster aid. Meanwhile, people in the town were making shelters out of the wreckage of their houses. The economy continued to decline in 1932 and 1933. The total value of imports and exports in the latter year was little more than one-fourth of what it had been in 1929.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe Belize Estate and Produce Company survived the depression years because of its special connections in British Honduras and London. Since 1875 various members of the Hoare family had been principal directors and maintained a controlling interest in the company. Sir [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]], a shareholder and former director, had been a British cabinet member and a friend of [[Leo Amery]], the British secretary of state for the colonies. In 1931, when the company was suffering from the aftereffects of the hurricane and the depression, family member Oliver V.G. Hoare contacted the Colonial Office to discuss the possibility of selling the company to buyers in the United States. The British government rescued the company by granting it an area of virgin mahogany forest and a loan of US$200,000 to erect a [[sawmill]] in Belize Town. When the government almost doubled the land tax, the large landowners refused to pay. The government accepted some virtually worthless land in lieu of taxes and in 1935 capitulated completely, reducing the tax to its former rate and annulling the landowners' arrears by making them retroactive to 1931. But small landowners had paid their taxes, often at a higher rate.<ref name=cs/>\n\nRobert Turton, the Creole millionaire who made his fortune from chicle exports, defeated C.H. Brown, the expatriate manager of the company, in the first elections for some of the Legislative Council seats in 1936. After the elections, the Governor promptly appointed Brown to the council, presumably to maintain the influence of what had for so long been the colony's chief business. But Brown's defeat by Turton, one of the company's chief local business rivals, marked the decline of old British enterprises in relation to the rising Creole entrepreneurs with their United States commercial connections.<ref name=cs/>\n\nMeanwhile, the Belize Estate and Produce Company drove Maya villagers from their homes in [[San Jos\u00e9, Orange Walk District|San Jose]] and Yalbac in the northwest and treated workers in mahogany camps almost like slaves. Investigators of labour conditions in the 1930s were appalled to discover that workers received rations of inferior flour and mess pork and tickets to be exchanged at the [[company store|commissaries]], in lieu of cash wages. As a result, workers and their families suffered from malnutrition and were continually in debt to their employers. The law governing labour contracts, the Masters and Servants Act of 1883, made it a criminal offence for a labourer to breach a contract. The offence was punishable by twenty-eight days of imprisonment with hard labour. In 1931 the Governor, Sir [[John Burdon]], rejected proposals to legalise trade unions and to introduce a [[minimum wage]] and sickness insurance. The conditions, aggravated by rising unemployment and the disastrous hurricane, were responsible for severe hardship among the poor. The poor responded in 1934 with a series of demonstrations, strikes, petitions and riots that marked the beginning of modern politics and the independence movement.<ref name=cs/>\n\n===Labour disturbances===\nRiots, strikes and rebellions had occurred before, during and after the period of slavery, but the events of the 1930s were modern labour disturbances in the sense that they gave rise to organisations with articulate industrial and political goals. A group calling itself the Unemployed Brigade marched through Belize Town on 14 February 1934, to present demands to the Governor and started a broad movement. Poor people, in desperation, turned to the Governor, who responded by creating a little relief work\u2014stone-breaking for US$0.10 a day. The Governor also offered a daily ration of two kilograms of cooked rice at the prison gates.<ref name=cs/> The leaders of the Unemployed Brigade gave up hope of further action and resigned.\n\nThe unemployed, demanding a cash dole, turned to [[Antonio Soberanis G\u00f3mez]] (1897\u20131975), who denounced the Unemployed Brigade's leaders as cowards. He said that he would continue fighting for the cause and that he was not afraid to die. In his most famous quote, he said, \"I'd rather be a dead hero than a living coward\". At a meeting on 16 March 1934, he took over the movement, which became the Labourers and Unemployed Association (LUA). For the next few weeks, Soberanis and his colleagues in the LUA attacked the Governor and his officials, the rich merchants, and the Belize Estate and Produce Company at biweekly meetings attended by 600 to 800 people. The workers demanded relief and a minimum wage. They couched their demands in broad moral and political terms that began to define and develop a new nationalistic and democratic political culture.<ref name=cs/>\n\nSoberanis was jailed under a new [[sedition]] law in 1935. Still, the labour agitation achieved a great deal. Of most immediate importance was the creation of relief work by a Governor who saw it as a way to avoid civil disturbances. Workers built more than 300 kilometres of roads. The Governor also pressed for a semi-representative government. But when the new constitution was passed in April 1935, it included the restrictive [[suffrage|franchise]] demanded by the appointed majority of the Legislative Council, which had no interest in furthering democracy. High voter-eligibility standards for property and income limited the electorate to the wealthiest 2 percent of the population. Poor people, therefore, could not vote; they could only support members of the Creole middle classes that opposed big-business candidates. The Citizens' Political Party and the LUA endorsed Robert Turton and Arthur Balderamos, a Creole lawyer, who formed the chief opposition in the new council of 1936. Working-class agitation continued, and in 1939 all six seats on the Belize Town Board (the voting requirements allowed for a more representative electorate) went to middle-class Creoles who appeared more sympathetic to labour.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe greatest achievements of the agitation of the 1930s were the labour reforms passed between 1941 and 1943. Trade unions were legalised in 1941, but the laws did not require employers to recognise these unions. Furthermore, the penal clauses of the old Masters and Servants Act rendered the new rights ineffectual. Employers among the unofficial members at the Legislative Council defeated a bill to repeal these penal clauses in August 1941, but the Employers and Workers Bill passed on 27 April 1943, finally removed breach-of-labour-contract from the criminal code and enabled British Honduras's infant trade unions to pursue the struggle for improving labour conditions. The [[General Workers' Union (Belize)|General Workers' Union]] (GWU), registered in 1943, quickly expanded into a nationwide organisation and provided crucial support for the nationalist movement that took off with the formation of the [[People's United Party]] (PUP) in 1950. The 1930s were therefore the crucible of modern Belizean politics. It was a decade during which the old phenomena of exploitative labour conditions and authoritarian colonial and industrial relations began to give way to new labour and political processes and institutions.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe same period saw an expansion in voter eligibility. Between 1939 and 1954, less than 2 percent of the population elected six members in the Legislative Council of thirteen members. In 1945 only 822 voters were registered in a population of over 63,000. The proportion of voters increased slightly in 1945, partly because the minimum age for women voters was reduced from thirty to twenty-one years. The devaluation of the British Honduras dollar in 1949 effectively reduced the property and income voter-eligibility standards. Finally, in 1954 British Honduras achieved suffrage for all literate adults as a result of the emerging independence movement. This development was a prelude to the process of constitutional decolonisation.<ref name=cs/>\n\n===Independence movement===\n{{see also|The Nationalist Movement (Belize)}}\nThe origins of the independence movement also lay in the 1930s and 1940s. Three groups played important roles in the colony's politics during this period. One group consisted of working-class individuals and emphasised labour issues. This group originated with Soberanis's LUA between 1934 and 1937 and continued through the GWU. The second group, a radical nationalist movement, emerged during World War II. Its leaders came from the LUA and the local branch of [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]]. The group called itself variously the British Honduras Independent Labour Party, the People's Republican Party and the People's National Committee. The third group consisted of people such as the Christian Social Action Group (CSAG) who engaged in electoral politics within the narrow limits defined by the constitution and whose goals included a \"Natives First\" campaign and an extension of the franchise to elect a more representative government.<ref name=cs/>\n\nIn 1947 a group of graduates of the elite Catholic [[St. John's College, Belize|Saint John's College]] formed the CSAG and won control of the Belize City Council. One member of this group, [[George Cadle Price]], topped the polls in the 1947 election when he opposed immigration schemes and import controls and rode a wave of feeling against a British proposal for a federation of its colonies in the Caribbean. Price was an eclectic and pragmatic politician whose ideological position was often obscured under a cloak of religious values and quotations. He remained the predominant politician in the country from the early 1950s until his retirement in 1996.<ref name=cs/> The CSAG also started a newspaper, the ''Belize Billboard'' edited by Philip Goldson and [[Leigh Richardson]].\n\nThe event that precipitated Price's political career and the formation of the PUP, was the devaluation of the British Honduras dollar on 31 December 1949. In September 1949, the British government devalued the British pound sterling. In spite of repeated denials by the Governor that the British Honduras dollar would be devalued to maintain the old exchange rate with the British pound, devaluation was nevertheless effected by the Governor, using his reserve powers in defiance of the Legislative Council. The Governor's action angered the nationalists because it reflected the limits of the legislature and revealed the extent of the colonial administration's power. The devaluation enraged labour because it protected the interests of the big transnationals, such as the Belize Estate and Produce Company, whose trade in British pounds would have suffered without devaluation while it subjected British Honduras's working class, already experiencing widespread unemployment and poverty, to higher prices for goods\u2014especially food\u2014imported from the United States. Devaluation thus united labour, nationalists and the Creole middle classes in opposition to the colonial administration. On the night that the Governor declared the devaluation, the People's Committee was formed and the nascent independence movement suddenly matured.<ref name=cs/>\n\nBefore the end of January 1950, the GWU and the People's Committee were holding joint public meetings and discussing issues such as devaluation, labour legislation, the proposed [[West Indies Federation]], and constitutional reform. The GWU was the only mass organisation of working people, so the early success of the independence movement would have been impossible without the support of this union. In fact, the GWU president, Clifford Betson was one of the original members of the People's Committee. On 28 April 1950, the middle-class members of the People's Committee (formerly members of the CSAG) took over the leadership of the union and gave Betson the dubious honorific title of \"patriarch of the union\". On 29 September 1950, the People's Committee was dissolved and the [[People's United Party]] (PUP) formed in its place.\n\n===Rise of the PUP===\n{{main|People's United Party}}\nBetween 1950 and 1954, the People's United Party consolidated its organisation, established its popular base, and articulated its primary demands. ''Belize Billboard'' editors Philip Goldson and [[Leigh Richardson]] were prominent members of the PUP and gave the party their full support through anti-colonial editorials. A year later, George Price, the secretary of the PUP, became vice-president of the GWU. The political leaders took control of the union to use its strength, and in turn the union movement declined as it became increasingly dependent upon politicians in the 1950s.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe PUP concentrated on agitating for constitutional reforms, including universal adult suffrage without a literacy test, an all- elected Legislative Council, an Executive Council chosen by the leader of the majority party in the legislature, the introduction of a ministerial system, and the abolition of the Governor's reserve powers. In short, PUP pushed for representative and responsible government. The colonial administration, alarmed by the growing support for the PUP, retaliated by attacking two of the party's chief public platforms. In July 1951, the Governor dissolved the Belize City Council on the pretext that it had shown disloyalty by refusing to display a picture of [[King George VI]]. Then, in October, the Governor charged ''Belize Billboard'' publishers and owners, including Richardson and Goldson, with sedition. The Governor jailed them for twelve months with hard labour. Soon after, PUP leader John Smith resigned because the party would not agree to fly the British flag at public meetings. The removal of three of four chief leaders was a blow to the party, but the events left Price in a powerful position. In 1952 he comfortably topped the polls in Belize City Council elections. Within just two years, despite persecution and division, the PUP had become a powerful political force, and George Price had clearly become the party's leader.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe colonial administration and the [[National Party (Belize)|National Party]], which consisted of loyalist members of the Legislative Council, portrayed the PUP as pro-Guatemalan and even communist. The leaders of the PUP, however, perceived British Honduras as belonging to neither Britain nor Guatemala. The Governor and the National Party failed in their attempts to discredit the PUP on the issue of its contacts with Guatemala, which was then ruled by the democratic, reformist government of president [[Jacobo Arbenz]]. When voters went to the polls on 28 April 1954, in the first election under universal literate adult suffrage, the main issue was clearly colonialism\u2014a vote for the PUP was a vote in favour of self-government. Almost 70 percent of the electorate voted. The PUP gained 66.3 percent of the vote and won eight of the nine elected seats in the new Legislative Assembly. Further constitutional reform was unequivocally on the agenda.<ref name=cs/>\n\n==Decolonization and the border dispute with Guatemala==\n[[File:BritishHonduras-1965.jpg|thumb|right|1965 map of British Honduras]]\n{{For|history following 1981|History of Belize#Independence}}\n{{main|Belizean\u2013Guatemalan territorial dispute}}\nBritish Honduras faced two obstacles to independence: British reluctance until the early 1960s to allow citizens to govern themselves, and [[Guatemala]]'s complete intransigence over its long-standing claim to the entire territory. By 1961, the United Kingdom was willing to let the colony become independent and from 1964 controlled only defence, foreign affairs, internal security, and the terms and conditions of the public service. On 1 June 1973, the colony's name was changed to Belize in anticipation of independence. The stalemate in the protracted negotiations between the UK and Guatemala over the future status of Belize led Belizeans after 1975 to seek the international community's assistance in resolving issues associated with independence. Even after Belize became independent in 1981, however, the territorial dispute remained unsettled.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe territorial dispute's origins lay in the 18th-century treaties in which Great Britain acceded to Spain's assertion of sovereignty while British settlers continued to occupy the sparsely settled and ill-defined area. The 1786 [[Convention of London (1786)|Convention of London]], which affirmed Spanish sovereignty was never renegotiated, but Spain never attempted to reclaim the area after 1798.\n\nAt the centre of Guatemala's oldest claim was the 1859 treaty between the United Kingdom and Guatemala. From Britain's viewpoint, this treaty merely settled the boundaries of an area already under British dominion. Guatemala had an alternative view that this agreement stated that Guatemala would give up its territorial claims only under certain conditions, including the construction of a road from Guatemala to the [[Caribbean]] coast. The UK never built the road, and Guatemala said it would repudiate the treaty in 1884 but never followed up on the threat.\n\nThe dispute appeared to have been forgotten until the 1930s when the government of General Jorge Ubico claimed that the treaty was invalid because the road had not been constructed. Britain argued that because neither the short-lived [[Central American Federation]] (1821\u20131839) nor Guatemala had ever exercised any authority in the area or even protested the British presence in the 19th century, British Honduras was clearly under British sovereignty. In its constitution of 1945, however, Guatemala stated that British Honduras was the twenty-third department of Guatemala.\n \nIn February 1948, Guatemala threatened to invade and forcibly annex the territory, and the British responded by deploying two companies from 2nd Battalion [[Gloucestershire Regiment]]. Since 1954 a succession of military and right-wing governments in Guatemala frequently whipped up nationalist sentiment, with incursions in 1957 and 1958.<ref name=cs/><ref name=smallwars>[http://britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Honduras.htm British Honduras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415203909/http://britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Honduras.htm |date=15 April 2014 }}. Britains-smallwars.com.</ref>\n[[File:LocationBelizeandGuatemala.png|left|thumb|280px|Belize and Guatemala]]\n\nNegotiations between Britain and Guatemala began again in 1961, but the elected representatives of British Honduras had no voice in these talks. As a result, in 1965 the United States President [[Lyndon Johnson]] agreed to mediate and proposed a draft treaty that gave Guatemala control over the newly independent country in areas including internal security, defence and external affairs. All parties in British Honduras, however, denounced the proposals.<ref name=cs/>\n\nA series of meetings, begun in 1969, ended abruptly in 1972 when tensions flared over a possible Guatemalan invasion.<ref>{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Rowland|title=Phoenix squadron|date=2010|publisher=Bantam Press|isbn=978-0552152907}}</ref> Talks resumed in 1973, but broke off again in 1975 when tensions flared once more.<ref name=smallwars/> Between 1975 and 1981, the Belizean and British governments, frustrated at dealing with the military-dominated regimes in Guatemala, began to state their case for self-determination at international forums such as a meeting of the heads of [[Commonwealth of Nations]] governments in [[Jamaica]], the conference of ministers of the [[Nonaligned Movement]] in Peru, and at meetings of the United Nations (UN).\n\nThe support of the Nonaligned Movement proved crucial and assured success at the UN.<ref name=cs/> Latin American governments initially supported Guatemala, however [[Cuba]], [[Mexico]], [[Panama]] and [[Nicaragua]] later declared unequivocal support for an independent Belize.<ref name=cs/> Finally, in November 1980, with Guatemala completely isolated, the UN passed a resolution that demanded the independence of Belize, with all its territory intact, before the next session of the UN in 1981.<ref name=cs/>\n\nA last attempt was made to reach an agreement with Guatemala prior to the independence of Belize and a proposal, called the [[Heads of Agreement (1981)|Heads of Agreement]], was initialled on 11 March 1981. However, the Guatemalan government refused to ratify the agreement and withdrew from the negotiations, and the opposition in Belize engaged in violent demonstrations against it. With the prospect of independence celebrations in the offing, the opposition's morale fell and independence came to Belize on 21 September 1981, without an agreement with Guatemala.<ref name=cs/>\n\n==Government==\nBefore 1884 the colonial administration of British Honduras was rather haphazard. In the early days, the colonists governed themselves under a public meeting system, similar to the [[town meeting]] system used in [[New England]]. A set of regulations called \"[[Burnaby's Code]]\" was adopted in 1765, which continued in force until 1840, when an executive council was created. Also in 1840, the colony formally became known as British Honduras, although it was also referred to as \"the Belize\". In 1853 the public meeting system was abandoned in favour of a legislative assembly, part of which was elected by a restricted franchise. The assembly was presided over by the British superintendent, an office created in 1784.\n\nFrom 1749 until 1884, British Honduras was governed as a [[Dependent territory|dependency]] of the British colony of Jamaica. Upon its designation as a Crown colony in 1871, a Lieutenant Governor under the Governor of Jamaica replaced the superintendent, and a nominated legislative council replaced the legislative assembly. When the colony was finally severed from the administration of Jamaica in 1884, it gained its own Governor.\n\nIn 1935 legislative franchise was reintroduced with a lower income qualification. Universal adult franchise was adopted in 1954, and a majority of seats in the legislature were made elective. A ministerial system was introduced in 1961, and the colony achieved self-government status in 1964.\n\n==Economy==\nForestry dominated the economy of British Honduras. Initially, the focus was upon [[logwood]], which was used in dye manufacture. Falling prices for logwood in the 1770s led to a shift toward logging mahogany, which would dominate the economy until the mid-20th century. As the logging of mahogany was far more labour-intensive, this also led to a significant increase of the importation of African [[slavery|slaves]] to the colony, mainly from Britain's Caribbean colonies. Due largely to extremely harsh working conditions, the colony experienced four slave revolts, the first in 1765 and the last in 1820. Slavery was finally abolished in 1838. Exports of mahogany continued as an economic mainstay, as commercial agriculture remained unprofitable due to unfavourable colonial tax policies and trade restrictions. Colonial officials provided incentives during the 1860s that resulted in a large influx of Americans from the Southern United States, especially [[Louisiana]], during and after the American Civil War. The [[Confederate settlements in British Honduras]] introduced large-scale sugar production to the colony and proved that it could be profitable where others had previously failed.\n\nThe lack of diversification in the economy left the colony very susceptible to swings in the mahogany market. The Great Depression of the 1930s and an especially destructive [[hurricane]] in 1931, further depressed the economy and already low living conditions. From 1914 on, the forestry industry was in steady decline, except for a brief revival during [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945). In the 1950s agriculture finally became a dominant part of economy, and in the 1970s fishing became significant. [[Land reform]] after World War II aided this expansion of the economy.\n\n==Demographics==\nBy the time of the colony's 1790 census, three-quarters of the population of British Honduras were a mixed-race people known as \"Creole people\".\nThey were the ancestors of the original Belizean-Creole population, who were, and still are, the biological offspring of European men and enslaved African women. The Europeans who sired the original Belizean-Creole people consisted mainly of British, Portuguese, Spanish and French men.\n\nThe [[Abolition of the Slave Trade Act|abolition of the slave trade]] in 1807, high death rates and low birth rates substantially reduced the ethnic African portion of the population. The white portion of the population remained consistently at around 10%. The largest portion of the population became the Mestizo people, now about 50% of modern Belize. The Mayans are still present in Belize and comprise around 11% of the population.\n\nThe population of the colony was always fairly small. In 1790 it was around 4,000. In 1856 it was estimated to be 20,000. By 1931 this figure grew to just over 50,000, and in 1946 to just under 60,000. However, by 1970 the population doubled to just under 120,000. On the eve of independence in 1980, the population stood at over 145,000.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of colonial governors and administrators of British Honduras]]\n* [[Attorney General of Belize|Attorney General of British Honduras]]\n* [[Chief Justice of Belize|Chief Justice of British Honduras]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=Geography |volume=3 |series=[[English Cyclopaedia]] |editor= Charles Knight |location=London |year=1866 |publisher=Bradbury, Evans, & Co. |chapterurl= http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433000064802?urlappend=%3Bseq=120 |chapter=British Honduras }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.belize.gov.bz/ Government of Belize website]\n* [http://www.thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/belize Belize at The Commonwealth]\n* [http://countrystudies.us/belize U.S. Library of Congress country study]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061019085524/http://www.belizenet.com/history/toc.html \"A History of Belize\" at Naturalight Productions' Belize tourism website]\n* [http://jesuitarchives.org/belize-mission-collection Jesuit mission picture archives, early 20th century]\n* [http://www.numismondo.net/pm/brh/ British Honduras Paper Money]\n\n{{Belize topics}}\n{{British overseas territories}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{coord|17|4|N|88|42|W|type:country|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:British Honduras| ]]\n[[Category:History of Belize by period]]\n[[Category:Colonial Central America]]\n[[Category:Former British colonies and protectorates in the Americas]]\n[[Category:Former colonies in North America]]\n[[Category:Monarchy in Belize]]\n[[Category:Former polities of the Cold War]]\n[[Category:Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]\n[[Category:20th century in Belize]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1862]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1981]]\n[[Category:1862 establishments in British Honduras|*]]\n[[Category:1981 disestablishments in Belize|*]]\n[[Category:1862 establishments in North America]]\n[[Category:1981 disestablishments in North America]]\n[[Category:1981 disestablishments in the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Belize\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:Former British colonies]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Infobox country\n| native_name                = \n| conventional_long_name                = British Honduras (1638\u20131973)<br>Belize (1973\u20131981)\n| common_name                = British Honduras (1638\u20131973)<br>Belize (1973\u20131981)\n| status                = Colony\n| empire                = United Kingdom\n| government_type                = [[Crown colony]] ([[monarchy]])\n| event_start                = [[Crown colony]]\n| year_start                = \n| date_start                = 1638\n| year_end                = 1981\n| date_end                = 21 September\n| event_end                = Independence\n| event1                = [[Self-governing colony|Self-governing]]\n| date_event1                = 1 January 1964\n| event2                = Renamed\n| date_event2                = 1 June 1973\n| event_pre                = Settled\n| date_pre                = 1638\n| p1                = Indigenous people of Belize\n| flag_p1                = \n| s1                = Belize\n| flag_s1                = Flag of Belize.svg\n| image_flag                = Flag of British Honduras (1919\u20131981).svg\n| flag_alt                = Flag of British Honduras from 1870\u20131919\n| flag_type                = Flag (1919-1981)\n| image_flag2                = \n| flag_alt2                = Flag of Ceylon from 1919\u20131981\n| flag                = Flag of Belize\n| image_coat                = Full Arms of British Honduras.svg\n| symbol_type                = [[Coat of arms of Belize|Coat of arms]]\n| image_map                = LocationBelize.svg\n| national_anthem                = {{plainlist|\n*[[God Save the Queen]] (1837\u20131901;

In the second half of the 19th century, however, a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the Maya.<ref name=cs/>\n\nDuring the [[Caste War]] in [[Yucat\u00e1n]], a devastating struggle that halved the population of the area between 1847 and 1855, thousands of refugees fled to the British settlement. The Legislative Assembly had given large landowners in the colony firm titles to their vast estates in 1855 but did not allow the Maya to own land. The Maya could only rent land or live on reservations. Nevertheless, most of the refugees were small farmers, who by 1857 were growing considerable quantities of sugar, rice, corn, and vegetables in the Northern District (now [[Corozal District|Corozal]] and [[Orange Walk District|Orange Walk]] districts). In 1857, the town of Corozal, then six years old, had 4,500 inhabitants, second in population only to Belize Town, which had 7,000 inhabitants. Some Maya who had fled the strife in the north, but had no wish to become British subjects, settled in the remote Yalbac Hills, just beyond the woodcutting frontier in the northwest. By 1862, about 1,000 Maya established themselves in 10 villages in this area, with the center in [[San Pedro Town|San Pedro]]. One group of Maya, led by Marcos Canul, attacked a mahogany camp on the Bravo River in 1866, demanding ransom for their prisoners and rent for their land. A detachment of British troops sent to San Pedro was defeated by the Maya later that year. Early in 1867, more than 300 British troops marched into the Yalbac Hills and destroyed the Mayan villages, provision stores, and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district. The Maya returned, however, and in April 1870, Canul and his men marched into Corozal and occupied the town.<ref name=cs/>\n\nTwo years later, Canul and 150 men [[Battle of Orange Walk|attacked the barracks at Orange Walk]]. After several hours of fighting, Canul's group retired. Canul, mortally wounded, died on 1 September 1872. That battle was the last serious attack on the colony.<ref name=cs/>\n{{History of Belize}}\nIn the 1880s and 1890s, [[Mopan people|Mop\u00e1n]] and [[Q'eqchi' people|Kekch\u00ed]] Maya fled from forced labour in Guatemala and came to British Honduras. They settled in several villages in southern British Honduras, mainly around San Antonio in [[Toledo District]]. The Maya could use Crown lands set aside as reservations, but these people{{clarify|date=December 2017}} lacked communal rights. Under the policy of [[indirect rule]], a system of elected [[alcalde]]s (mayors), adopted from Spanish local government, linked these Maya to the colonial administration. However, the remoteness of the area of British Honduras in which they settled, combined with their largely subsistence way of life, resulted in the Mop\u00e1n and Kekch\u00ed Maya maintaining more of their traditional way of life and becoming less assimilated into the colony than the Maya of the north. The Mop\u00e1n and Kekch\u00ed Maya maintained their languages and a strong sense of identity. But in the north, the distinction between Maya and Spanish was increasingly blurred, and a [[Mestizo]] culture emerged. In different ways and to different degrees, then, the Maya who returned to British Honduras in the 19th century became incorporated into the colony as poor and dispossessed ethnic minorities.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the ethnic pattern that remained largely intact throughout the 20th century was in place: Protestants largely of African descent, who spoke either English or Creole, lived in Belize Town; the Roman Catholic Maya and Mestizos spoke Spanish and lived chiefly in the north and west; and the Roman Catholic Garifuna who spoke English, Spanish, or Garifuna and settled on the southern coast.<ref name=cs/>\n\n==Formal establishment of the colony, 1862\u20131871==\nThe forestry industry's control of land and its influence in colonial decision making hindered the development of agriculture and the diversification of the economy. In many parts of the Caribbean, large numbers of former slaves, some of whom had engaged in the cultivation and marketing of food crops, became landowners. British Honduras had vast areas of sparsely populated, unused land. Nevertheless, land ownership was controlled by a small European monopoly, thwarting the evolution of a Creole landowning class from the former slaves. Rather than the former slaves, it was the [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]], Maya and Mestizos who pioneered agriculture in 19th-century British Honduras. These groups either rented land or lived as squatters. However, the domination of the land by forestry interests continued to stifle agriculture and kept much of the population dependent on imported foods.<ref name=cs/>\n\nLandownership became even more consolidated during the economic depression of the mid-19th century. Exports of mahogany peaked at over 4 million linear metres in 1846 but fell to about 1.6 million linear meters in 1859 and 8,000 linear meters in 1870, the lowest level since the beginning of the century. Mahogany and logwood continued to account for over 80 percent of the total value of exports, but the price of these goods was so low that the economy was in a state of prolonged depression after the 1850s. Major results of this depression included the decline of the old settler class, the increasing consolidation of capital and the intensification of British landownership. The British Honduras Company emerged as the predominant landowner of the Crown colony. The firm originated in a partnership between one of the old settler families and a London merchant and was registered in 1859 as a [[limited company]]. The firm expanded, often at the expense of others who were forced to sell their land.\n\nLargely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the Maya, the expenses of administering the new colony of British Honduras increased, and that at a time of severe depression in the economy. Large landowners and merchants dominated the Legislative Assembly, which controlled the colony's revenues and expenditures. Some of the landowners also had involvement in commerce, but their interest differed from those of the other merchants of Belize Town. The former group resisted the taxation of land and favoured an increase in import duties; the latter preferred the opposite. Moreover, the merchants in the town felt relatively secure from Mayan attacks and reluctant to contribute toward the protection of mahogany camps, whereas the landowners felt that they should not be required to pay taxes on lands given inadequate protection. These conflicting interests produced a stalemate in the Legislative Assembly, which failed to authorise the raising of sufficient revenue. Unable to agree among themselves, the members of the Legislative Assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for the establishment of direct British rule in return for the greater security of [[Crown colony]] status. The new constitution was inaugurated in April 1871 and the Legislative Council became the new legislature.<ref name=cs/>\n\n==Colonial order, 1871\u20131931==\nUnder the new constitution of 1871, the Lieutenant Governor and the Legislative Council, consisting of five ex-officio or \"official\" and four appointed or \"unofficial\" members, governed British Honduras. This constitutional change confirmed and completed a change in the locus and form of power in the colony's political economy that had evolved during the preceding half-century. The change moved power from the old settler oligarchy to the boardrooms of British companies and to the Colonial Office in London.<ref name=cs/>\n\nIn 1875, the British Honduras Company became the Belize Estate and Produce Company, a London-based business that owned about half of all the privately held land in the colony. The new company was the chief force in British Honduras's political economy for over a century.<ref name=cs/><ref name=cs/>\n\nThis concentration and centralisation of capital meant that the direction of the colony's economy was henceforth determined largely in London. It also signalled the eclipse of the old settler elite. By about 1890, most commerce in British Honduras was in the hands of a clique of Scottish and German merchants, most of them newcomers. This clique encouraged consumption of imported goods and thus furthered British Honduras's dependence on Britain. The European minority exercised great influence in the colony's politics, partly because it was guaranteed representation on the wholly appointed Legislative Council. The manager of the Belize Estate and Produce Company, for example, was automatically a member of the council, while members of the emerging Creole elite were excluded from holding seats on the council. The Creoles requested in 1890 that some seats on the council be opened to election (as had occurred in Canada and New Zealand) in the hope of winning seats, but the Legislative Council refused. In 1892, the Governor appointed several Creole members, but whites remained the majority. In 1919 demobilised Creole servicemen protested British racism, but British troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest, which was indicative of discontent but had little lasting effect. In the 1920s, the Colonial Office supported agitation for an elective council as long as the Governor had reserve powers to allow him to push through any measures he considered essential without the council's assent. But the council rejected these provisos, and the issue of restoring elections was postponed.<ref name=cs/>\n\nDespite the prevailing stagnation of the colony's economy and society during most of the century prior to the 1930s, seeds of change were being sown. The mahogany trade remained depressed, and efforts to develop plantation agriculture in several crops, including sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas and coconuts failed. In 1894 mahogany workers rioted against a cut in their real wages caused by devaluation, but British troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest. A brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the United States. Exports of [[chicle]], a gum taken from the [[sapodilla]] tree and used to make chewing gum, propped up the economy from the 1880s. Much of the gum was tapped in Mexican and Guatemalan forests by Mayan chicleros who had been recruited by labour contractors in British Honduras. A short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the United States, but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources. The introduction of tractors and bulldozers opened up new areas in the west and south in the 1920s, but this development led again to only a temporary revival. At this time, mahogany, cedar and chicle together accounted for 97 percent of forest production and 82 percent of the total value of exports. The economy, which was increasingly oriented toward trade with the United States, remained dependent and underdeveloped.<ref name=cs/>\n\nCreoles, who were well-connected with businesses in the United States, challenged the traditional political-economic connection with Britain as trade with the United States intensified. Men such as Robert S. Turton, the Creole chicle buyer for [[Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory|Wrigley's]], and Henry I. Melhado, whose merchant family dealt in illicit liquor during [[prohibition]], became major political and economic figures. In 1927, Creole merchants and professionals replaced the representatives of British landowners, (except for the manager of the Belize Estate and Produce Company) on the Legislative Council. The participation of this Creole elite in the political process was evidence of emerging social changes that were largely concealed by economic stagnation. These changes accelerated with such force in the 1930s that they ushered in a new era of modern politics.<ref name=cs/>\n\n==Genesis of modern politics, 1931\u20131954==\n[[File:Convent Belize 1931 hurricane.jpg|Destruction from the [[1931 Belize hurricane]]|thumb|right]]\nThe [[Great Depression]] shattered the colony's economy, and unemployment increased rapidly. The Colonial Report for 1931 stated that \"contracts for the purchase of mahogany and chicle, which form the mainstay of the Colony, practically ceased altogether, thereby throwing a large number of the woodcutters and chicle-gatherers out of work\". On top of this economic disaster, the [[1931 Belize hurricane|worst hurricane in the country's recent history]] demolished Belize Town on 10 September 1931, killing more than 1,000 people and destroying at least three-quarters of the housing. The British relief response was tardy and inadequate. The British government seized the opportunity to impose tighter control on the colony and endowed the Governor with reserve powers, or the power to enact laws in emergency situations without the consent of the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council resisted but eventually passed a resolution agreeing to give the Governor reserve powers to obtain disaster aid. Meanwhile, people in the town were making shelters out of the wreckage of their houses. The economy continued to decline in 1932 and 1933. The total value of imports and exports in the latter year was little more than one-fourth of what it had been in 1929.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe Belize Estate and Produce Company survived the depression years because of its special connections in British Honduras and London. Since 1875 various members of the Hoare family had been principal directors and maintained a controlling interest in the company. Sir [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]], a shareholder and former director, had been a British cabinet member and a friend of [[Leo Amery]], the British secretary of state for the colonies. In 1931, when the company was suffering from the aftereffects of the hurricane and the depression, family member Oliver V.G. Hoare contacted the Colonial Office to discuss the possibility of selling the company to buyers in the United States. The British government rescued the company by granting it an area of virgin mahogany forest and a loan of US$200,000 to erect a [[sawmill]] in Belize Town. When the government almost doubled the land tax, the large landowners refused to pay. The government accepted some virtually worthless land in lieu of taxes and in 1935 capitulated completely, reducing the tax to its former rate and annulling the landowners' arrears by making them retroactive to 1931. But small landowners had paid their taxes, often at a higher rate.<ref name=cs/>\n\nRobert Turton, the Creole millionaire who made his fortune from chicle exports, defeated C.H. Brown, the expatriate manager of the company, in the first elections for some of the Legislative Council seats in 1936. After the elections, the Governor promptly appointed Brown to the council, presumably to maintain the influence of what had for so long been the colony's chief business. But Brown's defeat by Turton, one of the company's chief local business rivals, marked the decline of old British enterprises in relation to the rising Creole entrepreneurs with their United States commercial connections.<ref name=cs/>\n\nMeanwhile, the Belize Estate and Produce Company drove Maya villagers from their homes in [[San Jos\u00e9, Orange Walk District|San Jose]] and Yalbac in the northwest and treated workers in mahogany camps almost like slaves. Investigators of labour conditions in the 1930s were appalled to discover that workers received rations of inferior flour and mess pork and tickets to be exchanged at the [[company store|commissaries]], in lieu of cash wages. As a result, workers and their families suffered from malnutrition and were continually in debt to their employers. The law governing labour contracts, the Masters and Servants Act of 1883, made it a criminal offence for a labourer to breach a contract. The offence was punishable by twenty-eight days of imprisonment with hard labour. In 1931 the Governor, Sir [[John Burdon]], rejected proposals to legalise trade unions and to introduce a [[minimum wage]] and sickness insurance. The conditions, aggravated by rising unemployment and the disastrous hurricane, were responsible for severe hardship among the poor. The poor responded in 1934 with a series of demonstrations, strikes, petitions and riots that marked the beginning of modern politics and the independence movement.<ref name=cs/>\n\n===Labour disturbances===\nRiots, strikes and rebellions had occurred before, during and after the period of slavery, but the events of the 1930s were modern labour disturbances in the sense that they gave rise to organisations with articulate industrial and political goals. A group calling itself the Unemployed Brigade marched through Belize Town on 14 February 1934, to present demands to the Governor and started a broad movement. Poor people, in desperation, turned to the Governor, who responded by creating a little relief work\u2014stone-breaking for US$0.10 a day. The Governor also offered a daily ration of two kilograms of cooked rice at the prison gates.<ref name=cs/> The leaders of the Unemployed Brigade gave up hope of further action and resigned.\n\nThe unemployed, demanding a cash dole, turned to [[Antonio Soberanis G\u00f3mez]] (1897\u20131975), who denounced the Unemployed Brigade's leaders as cowards. He said that he would continue fighting for the cause and that he was not afraid to die. In his most famous quote, he said, \"I'd rather be a dead hero than a living coward\". At a meeting on 16 March 1934, he took over the movement, which became the Labourers and Unemployed Association (LUA). For the next few weeks, Soberanis and his colleagues in the LUA attacked the Governor and his officials, the rich merchants, and the Belize Estate and Produce Company at biweekly meetings attended by 600 to 800 people. The workers demanded relief and a minimum wage. They couched their demands in broad moral and political terms that began to define and develop a new nationalistic and democratic political culture.<ref name=cs/>\n\nSoberanis was jailed under a new [[sedition]] law in 1935. Still, the labour agitation achieved a great deal. Of most immediate importance was the creation of relief work by a Governor who saw it as a way to avoid civil disturbances. Workers built more than 300 kilometres of roads. The Governor also pressed for a semi-representative government. But when the new constitution was passed in April 1935, it included the restrictive [[suffrage|franchise]] demanded by the appointed majority of the Legislative Council, which had no interest in furthering democracy. High voter-eligibility standards for property and income limited the electorate to the wealthiest 2 percent of the population. Poor people, therefore, could not vote; they could only support members of the Creole middle classes that opposed big-business candidates. The Citizens' Political Party and the LUA endorsed Robert Turton and Arthur Balderamos, a Creole lawyer, who formed the chief opposition in the new council of 1936. Working-class agitation continued, and in 1939 all six seats on the Belize Town Board (the voting requirements allowed for a more representative electorate) went to middle-class Creoles who appeared more sympathetic to labour.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe greatest achievements of the agitation of the 1930s were the labour reforms passed between 1941 and 1943. Trade unions were legalised in 1941, but the laws did not require employers to recognise these unions. Furthermore, the penal clauses of the old Masters and Servants Act rendered the new rights ineffectual. Employers among the unofficial members at the Legislative Council defeated a bill to repeal these penal clauses in August 1941, but the Employers and Workers Bill passed on 27 April 1943, finally removed breach-of-labour-contract from the criminal code and enabled British Honduras's infant trade unions to pursue the struggle for improving labour conditions. The [[General Workers' Union (Belize)|General Workers' Union]] (GWU), registered in 1943, quickly expanded into a nationwide organisation and provided crucial support for the nationalist movement that took off with the formation of the [[People's United Party]] (PUP) in 1950. The 1930s were therefore the crucible of modern Belizean politics. It was a decade during which the old phenomena of exploitative labour conditions and authoritarian colonial and industrial relations began to give way to new labour and political processes and institutions.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe same period saw an expansion in voter eligibility. Between 1939 and 1954, less than 2 percent of the population elected six members in the Legislative Council of thirteen members. In 1945 only 822 voters were registered in a population of over 63,000. The proportion of voters increased slightly in 1945, partly because the minimum age for women voters was reduced from thirty to twenty-one years. The devaluation of the British Honduras dollar in 1949 effectively reduced the property and income voter-eligibility standards. Finally, in 1954 British Honduras achieved suffrage for all literate adults as a result of the emerging independence movement. This development was a prelude to the process of constitutional decolonisation.<ref name=cs/>\n\n===Independence movement===\n{{see also|The Nationalist Movement (Belize)}}\nThe origins of the independence movement also lay in the 1930s and 1940s. Three groups played important roles in the colony's politics during this period. One group consisted of working-class individuals and emphasised labour issues. This group originated with Soberanis's LUA between 1934 and 1937 and continued through the GWU. The second group, a radical nationalist movement, emerged during World War II. Its leaders came from the LUA and the local branch of [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]]. The group called itself variously the British Honduras Independent Labour Party, the People's Republican Party and the People's National Committee. The third group consisted of people such as the Christian Social Action Group (CSAG) who engaged in electoral politics within the narrow limits defined by the constitution and whose goals included a \"Natives First\" campaign and an extension of the franchise to elect a more representative government.<ref name=cs/>\n\nIn 1947 a group of graduates of the elite Catholic [[St. John's College, Belize|Saint John's College]] formed the CSAG and won control of the Belize City Council. One member of this group, [[George Cadle Price]], topped the polls in the 1947 election when he opposed immigration schemes and import controls and rode a wave of feeling against a British proposal for a federation of its colonies in the Caribbean. Price was an eclectic and pragmatic politician whose ideological position was often obscured under a cloak of religious values and quotations. He remained the predominant politician in the country from the early 1950s until his retirement in 1996.<ref name=cs/> The CSAG also started a newspaper, the ''Belize Billboard'' edited by Philip Goldson and [[Leigh Richardson]].\n\nThe event that precipitated Price's political career and the formation of the PUP, was the devaluation of the British Honduras dollar on 31 December 1949. In September 1949, the British government devalued the British pound sterling. In spite of repeated denials by the Governor that the British Honduras dollar would be devalued to maintain the old exchange rate with the British pound, devaluation was nevertheless effected by the Governor, using his reserve powers in defiance of the Legislative Council. The Governor's action angered the nationalists because it reflected the limits of the legislature and revealed the extent of the colonial administration's power. The devaluation enraged labour because it protected the interests of the big transnationals, such as the Belize Estate and Produce Company, whose trade in British pounds would have suffered without devaluation while it subjected British Honduras's working class, already experiencing widespread unemployment and poverty, to higher prices for goods\u2014especially food\u2014imported from the United States. Devaluation thus united labour, nationalists and the Creole middle classes in opposition to the colonial administration. On the night that the Governor declared the devaluation, the People's Committee was formed and the nascent independence movement suddenly matured.<ref name=cs/>\n\nBefore the end of January 1950, the GWU and the People's Committee were holding joint public meetings and discussing issues such as devaluation, labour legislation, the proposed [[West Indies Federation]], and constitutional reform. The GWU was the only mass organisation of working people, so the early success of the independence movement would have been impossible without the support of this union. In fact, the GWU president, Clifford Betson was one of the original members of the People's Committee. On 28 April 1950, the middle-class members of the People's Committee (formerly members of the CSAG) took over the leadership of the union and gave Betson the dubious honorific title of \"patriarch of the union\". On 29 September 1950, the People's Committee was dissolved and the [[People's United Party]] (PUP) formed in its place.\n\n===Rise of the PUP===\n{{main|People's United Party}}\nBetween 1950 and 1954, the People's United Party consolidated its organisation, established its popular base, and articulated its primary demands. ''Belize Billboard'' editors Philip Goldson and [[Leigh Richardson]] were prominent members of the PUP and gave the party their full support through anti-colonial editorials. A year later, George Price, the secretary of the PUP, became vice-president of the GWU. The political leaders took control of the union to use its strength, and in turn the union movement declined as it became increasingly dependent upon politicians in the 1950s.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe PUP concentrated on agitating for constitutional reforms, including universal adult suffrage without a literacy test, an all- elected Legislative Council, an Executive Council chosen by the leader of the majority party in the legislature, the introduction of a ministerial system, and the abolition of the Governor's reserve powers. In short, PUP pushed for representative and responsible government. The colonial administration, alarmed by the growing support for the PUP, retaliated by attacking two of the party's chief public platforms. In July 1951, the Governor dissolved the Belize City Council on the pretext that it had shown disloyalty by refusing to display a picture of [[King George VI]]. Then, in October, the Governor charged ''Belize Billboard'' publishers and owners, including Richardson and Goldson, with sedition. The Governor jailed them for twelve months with hard labour. Soon after, PUP leader John Smith resigned because the party would not agree to fly the British flag at public meetings. The removal of three of four chief leaders was a blow to the party, but the events left Price in a powerful position. In 1952 he comfortably topped the polls in Belize City Council elections. Within just two years, despite persecution and division, the PUP had become a powerful political force, and George Price had clearly become the party's leader.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe colonial administration and the [[National Party (Belize)|National Party]], which consisted of loyalist members of the Legislative Council, portrayed the PUP as pro-Guatemalan and even communist. The leaders of the PUP, however, perceived British Honduras as belonging to neither Britain nor Guatemala. The Governor and the National Party failed in their attempts to discredit the PUP on the issue of its contacts with Guatemala, which was then ruled by the democratic, reformist government of president [[Jacobo Arbenz]]. When voters went to the polls on 28 April 1954, in the first election under universal literate adult suffrage, the main issue was clearly colonialism\u2014a vote for the PUP was a vote in favour of self-government. Almost 70 percent of the electorate voted. The PUP gained 66.3 percent of the vote and won eight of the nine elected seats in the new Legislative Assembly. Further constitutional reform was unequivocally on the agenda.<ref name=cs/>\n\n==Decolonization and the border dispute with Guatemala==\n[[File:BritishHonduras-1965.jpg|thumb|right|1965 map of British Honduras]]\n{{For|history following 1981|History of Belize#Independence}}\n{{main|Belizean\u2013Guatemalan territorial dispute}}\nBritish Honduras faced two obstacles to independence: British reluctance until the early 1960s to allow citizens to govern themselves, and [[Guatemala]]'s complete intransigence over its long-standing claim to the entire territory. By 1961, the United Kingdom was willing to let the colony become independent and from 1964 controlled only defence, foreign affairs, internal security, and the terms and conditions of the public service. On 1 June 1973, the colony's name was changed to Belize in anticipation of independence. The stalemate in the protracted negotiations between the UK and Guatemala over the future status of Belize led Belizeans after 1975 to seek the international community's assistance in resolving issues associated with independence. Even after Belize became independent in 1981, however, the territorial dispute remained unsettled.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe territorial dispute's origins lay in the 18th-century treaties in which Great Britain acceded to Spain's assertion of sovereignty while British settlers continued to occupy the sparsely settled and ill-defined area. The 1786 [[Convention of London (1786)|Convention of London]], which affirmed Spanish sovereignty was never renegotiated, but Spain never attempted to reclaim the area after 1798.\n\nAt the centre of Guatemala's oldest claim was the 1859 treaty between the United Kingdom and Guatemala. From Britain's viewpoint, this treaty merely settled the boundaries of an area already under British dominion. Guatemala had an alternative view that this agreement stated that Guatemala would give up its territorial claims only under certain conditions, including the construction of a road from Guatemala to the [[Caribbean]] coast. The UK never built the road, and Guatemala said it would repudiate the treaty in 1884 but never followed up on the threat.\n\nThe dispute appeared to have been forgotten until the 1930s when the government of General Jorge Ubico claimed that the treaty was invalid because the road had not been constructed. Britain argued that because neither the short-lived [[Central American Federation]] (1821\u20131839) nor Guatemala had ever exercised any authority in the area or even protested the British presence in the 19th century, British Honduras was clearly under British sovereignty. In its constitution of 1945, however, Guatemala stated that British Honduras was the twenty-third department of Guatemala.\n \nIn February 1948, Guatemala threatened to invade and forcibly annex the territory, and the British responded by deploying two companies from 2nd Battalion [[Gloucestershire Regiment]]. Since 1954 a succession of military and right-wing governments in Guatemala frequently whipped up nationalist sentiment, with incursions in 1957 and 1958.<ref name=cs/><ref name=smallwars>[http://britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Honduras.htm British Honduras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415203909/http://britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Honduras.htm |date=15 April 2014 }}. Britains-smallwars.com.</ref>\n[[File:LocationBelizeandGuatemala.png|left|thumb|280px|Belize and Guatemala]]\n\nNegotiations between Britain and Guatemala began again in 1961, but the elected representatives of British Honduras had no voice in these talks. As a result, in 1965 the United States President [[Lyndon Johnson]] agreed to mediate and proposed a draft treaty that gave Guatemala control over the newly independent country in areas including internal security, defence and external affairs. All parties in British Honduras, however, denounced the proposals.<ref name=cs/>\n\nA series of meetings, begun in 1969, ended abruptly in 1972 when tensions flared over a possible Guatemalan invasion.<ref>{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Rowland|title=Phoenix squadron|date=2010|publisher=Bantam Press|isbn=978-0552152907}}</ref> Talks resumed in 1973, but broke off again in 1975 when tensions flared once more.<ref name=smallwars/> Between 1975 and 1981, the Belizean and British governments, frustrated at dealing with the military-dominated regimes in Guatemala, began to state their case for self-determination at international forums such as a meeting of the heads of [[Commonwealth of Nations]] governments in [[Jamaica]], the conference of ministers of the [[Nonaligned Movement]] in Peru, and at meetings of the United Nations (UN).\n\nThe support of the Nonaligned Movement proved crucial and assured success at the UN.<ref name=cs/> Latin American governments initially supported Guatemala, however [[Cuba]], [[Mexico]], [[Panama]] and [[Nicaragua]] later declared unequivocal support for an independent Belize.<ref name=cs/> Finally, in November 1980, with Guatemala completely isolated, the UN passed a resolution that demanded the independence of Belize, with all its territory intact, before the next session of the UN in 1981.<ref name=cs/>\n\nA last attempt was made to reach an agreement with Guatemala prior to the independence of Belize and a proposal, called the [[Heads of Agreement (1981)|Heads of Agreement]], was initialled on 11 March 1981. However, the Guatemalan government refused to ratify the agreement and withdrew from the negotiations, and the opposition in Belize engaged in violent demonstrations against it. With the prospect of independence celebrations in the offing, the opposition's morale fell and independence came to Belize on 21 September 1981, without an agreement with Guatemala.<ref name=cs/>\n\n==Government==\nBefore 1884 the colonial administration of British Honduras was rather haphazard. In the early days, the colonists governed themselves under a public meeting system, similar to the [[town meeting]] system used in [[New England]]. A set of regulations called \"[[Burnaby's Code]]\" was adopted in 1765, which continued in force until 1840, when an executive council was created. Also in 1840, the colony formally became known as British Honduras, although it was also referred to as \"the Belize\". In 1853 the public meeting system was abandoned in favour of a legislative assembly, part of which was elected by a restricted franchise. The assembly was presided over by the British superintendent, an office created in 1784.\n\nFrom 1749 until 1884, British Honduras was governed as a [[Dependent territory|dependency]] of the British colony of Jamaica. Upon its designation as a Crown colony in 1871, a Lieutenant Governor under the Governor of Jamaica replaced the superintendent, and a nominated legislative council replaced the legislative assembly. When the colony was finally severed from the administration of Jamaica in 1884, it gained its own Governor.\n\nIn 1935 legislative franchise was reintroduced with a lower income qualification. Universal adult franchise was adopted in 1954, and a majority of seats in the legislature were made elective. A ministerial system was introduced in 1961, and the colony achieved self-government status in 1964.\n\n==Economy==\nForestry dominated the economy of British Honduras. Initially, the focus was upon [[logwood]], which was used in dye manufacture. Falling prices for logwood in the 1770s led to a shift toward logging mahogany, which would dominate the economy until the mid-20th century. As the logging of mahogany was far more labour-intensive, this also led to a significant increase of the importation of African [[slavery|slaves]] to the colony, mainly from Britain's Caribbean colonies. Due largely to extremely harsh working conditions, the colony experienced four slave revolts, the first in 1765 and the last in 1820. Slavery was finally abolished in 1838. Exports of mahogany continued as an economic mainstay, as commercial agriculture remained unprofitable due to unfavourable colonial tax policies and trade restrictions. Colonial officials provided incentives during the 1860s that resulted in a large influx of Americans from the Southern United States, especially [[Louisiana]], during and after the American Civil War. The [[Confederate settlements in British Honduras]] introduced large-scale sugar production to the colony and proved that it could be profitable where others had previously failed.\n\nThe lack of diversification in the economy left the colony very susceptible to swings in the mahogany market. The Great Depression of the 1930s and an especially destructive [[hurricane]] in 1931, further depressed the economy and already low living conditions. From 1914 on, the forestry industry was in steady decline, except for a brief revival during [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945). In the 1950s agriculture finally became a dominant part of economy, and in the 1970s fishing became significant. [[Land reform]] after World War II aided this expansion of the economy.\n\n==Demographics==\nBy the time of the colony's 1790 census, three-quarters of the population of British Honduras were a mixed-race people known as \"Creole people\".\nThey were the ancestors of the original Belizean-Creole population, who were, and still are, the biological offspring of European men and enslaved African women. The Europeans who sired the original Belizean-Creole people consisted mainly of British, Portuguese, Spanish and French men.\n\nThe [[Abolition of the Slave Trade Act|abolition of the slave trade]] in 1807, high death rates and low birth rates substantially reduced the ethnic African portion of the population. The white portion of the population remained consistently at around 10%. The largest portion of the population became the Mestizo people, now about 50% of modern Belize. The Mayans are still present in Belize and comprise around 11% of the population.\n\nThe population of the colony was always fairly small. In 1790 it was around 4,000.

[[Coronation riots|Major riots]] broke out across Great Britain at the time of the coronation of George I. This show of feeling prompted James Stuart, who subsequently became known as the Old Pretender, to believe he had enough support to use military force to claim the British throne.\n\n==Cornish support==\n[[File:Glebe1.jpg|thumb|St Columb town square.

Part of their scheme was to capture [[Bristol]], [[Exeter]] and [[Plymouth]]. With these important places in the hands of the Jacobites, they hoped that other smaller towns would join the cause. Ormonde had implicit confidence in [[Colonel Maclean]], who had been sent to Devon and Cornwall to visit prominent members of the Tory party, and others likely to support the Pretender's cause. It turned out that Maclean was probably a spy who supplied the Ministry with names of Jacobite adherents, and measures were taken to prevent their committing mischief or folly.\n\nOn 22 September, [[John Anstis]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Launceston (UK Parliament constituency)|Launceston]], was arrested for plotting an uprising and on 6 October [[Sir Richard Vyvyan (Jacobite)|Sir Richard Vyvyan]] of Trelowarren (and [[Trewan Hall]], [[St Columb Major]]), MP for Cornwall and the most influential Jacobite in the West, was taken and sent to London in the custody of a messenger.<ref name=\"TDA \">{{cite book | title=Jacobite Prisoners of the 1715 Rebellion| first=P.

According to [[Ralph \"Sonny\" Barger]], founder of the [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] charter, early charters of the club were founded in [[San Francisco]], [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], [[San Bernardino, California|Fontana]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and elsewhere, with the members usually being unaware that there were other clubs. One of the lesser-known clubs existed in North [[Chino, California|Chino]]/South [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], in the late 1960s.\n\nOther sources claim that the Hells Angels in San Francisco were organized in 1953 by Rocky Graves, a Hells Angel member from [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] (\"Berdoo\"), implying that the \"Frisco\" Hells Angels were very much aware of their forebears.<ref>Birney Jarvis for ''Male'' magazine, 1964. Reprinted in ''Hells Angels'' by Hunter S. Thompson</ref> The \"Frisco\" Hells Angels were reorganized in 1955 with thirteen charter members, Frank Sadilek serving as President, and using the smaller, original logo. The Oakland charter, at the time headed by Barger, used a larger version of the \"Death's Head\" patch nicknamed the \"Barger Larger\", which was first used in 1959. It later became the club standard.\n\nThe Hells Angels are often depicted in semi-mythical romantic fashion like the 19th-century [[James\u2013Younger Gang]]: free-spirited, iconic, bound by brotherhood and loyalty. At other times, such as in the 1966 [[Roger Corman]] film ''[[The Wild Angels]]'', they are depicted as violent and nihilistic, little more than a violent criminal gang and a scourge on society.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bagnall |first=Sam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3311057.stm |title=Hells Angels: Easy-riders or criminal gang? |work=This World |publisher=BBC News |date=January 2, 2004 |accessdate=August 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe club became prominent within, and established its notoriety as part of the 1960s [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] movement in San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] scene, playing a part at many of the movement's seminal events. Members were directly connected to many of the counterculture's primary leaders, such as [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Jerry Garcia]] and the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Mick Farren]], and [[Tom Wolfe]].

Although the specific meaning of each patch is not publicly known, the patches identify specific or significant actions or beliefs of each biker.<ref>Gangs; A Journey into the heart of the British Underworld, Tony Thompson, (2004) {{ISBN|0-340-83053-0}}</ref> The official colors of the Hells Angels are red lettering displayed on a white background\u2014hence the club's nickname \"The Red and White\". These patches are worn on leather or denim jackets and vests.\n\nRed and white are also used to display the number 81 on many patches, as in \"Support 81, Route 81\". The 8 and 1 stand for the respective positions in the alphabet of ''H'' and ''A''. These are used by friends and supporters of the club in deference to club rules, which purport to restrict the wearing of Hells Angels imagery to club members. \nThe diamond-shaped [[Outlaw motorcycle club|one-percenter]] patch is also used, displaying '1%' in red on a white background with a red [[overlock|merrowed]] border. The term one-percenter is said to be a response to the [[American Motorcyclist Association]] (AMA) comment on the [[Hollister riot|Hollister incident]], to the effect that 99% of motorcyclists were law-abiding citizens and the last 1% were outlaws. The AMA has no record of such a statement to the press, and calls this story apocryphal.<ref name=Dulaney2005a>{{Cite news |last=Lindsey |first=Tom |periodical=International Journal of Motorcycle Studies |url=http://ijms.nova.edu/November2005/IJMS_Artcl.Dulaney.html |date=November 2005 |title=A Brief History of \"Outlaw\" Motorcycle Clubs |quote=The Life story caused something of a tumult around the country (Yates), and some authors have asserted that the AMA subsequently released a press statement disclaiming involvement in the Hollister event, stating that 99% of motorcyclists are good, decent, law-abiding citizens and that the AMA's ranks of motorcycle clubs were not involved in the debacle (e.g., Reynolds, Thompson). However, the American Motorcyclist Association has no record of ever releasing such a statement. Tom Lindsay, the AMA's Public Information Director, states 'We <nowiki>[the American Motorcyclist Association]</nowiki> acknowledge that the term 'one-percenter' has long been (and likely will continue to be) attributed to the American Motorcyclist Association, but we've been unable to attribute its original use to an AMA official or published statement\u2014so it's apocryphal.'}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hells Angels-03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|New York Hells Angels patch]]\nMost members wear a rectangular patch (again, white background with red letters and a red merrowed border) identifying their respective charter locations. Another similarly designed patch reads \"Hells Angels\". When applicable, members of the club wear a patch denoting their position or rank within the organization. The patch is rectangular and, similar to the patches described above, displays a white background with red letters and a red merrowed border. Some examples of the titles used are President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and [[Sergeant at Arms]]. This patch is usually worn above the 'club location' patch. Some members also wear a patch with the initials \"AFFA\", which stands for \"Angels Forever; Forever Angels\", referring to their lifelong membership in the biker club (i.e., \"once a member, always a member\").\n\nThe book ''Gangs'', written by Tony Thompson (a crime correspondent for ''[[The Observer]]''), states that [[Stephen Cunningham]], a member of the Angels, sported a new patch after he recovered from attempting to set a bomb, consisting of two Nazi-style SS lightning bolts below the words 'Filthy Few'. Some law enforcement officials claim that the patch is only awarded to those who have committed or are prepared to commit murder on behalf of the club. According to a report from the ''R. v. Bonner and Lindsay'' case in 2005 ''(see related section below)'', another patch, similar to the 'Filthy Few' patch is the 'Dequiallo' patch.

At the end of that stage, he is reclassified as \"prospect\", participating in some club activities, but not having voting privileges while he is evaluated for suitability as a full member. The last phase, and highest membership status, is \"Full Membership\" or \"[[Colors (motorcycling)|Full-Patch]]\".<ref name=membership>NDIC Document, [http://cryptome.wikileaks.org/gangs/hells.pdf US Department of Justice Report on OMG HA]</ref> The term \"Full-Patch\" refers to the complete four-piece insignia, including the \"Death Head\" logo, two rockers (top rocker: \"Hells Angels\"; bottom rocker: state or territory claimed) and the rectangular \"MC\" patch below the wing of the Death's Head. Prospects are allowed to wear only a bottom rocker with the state or territory name along with the rectangular \"MC\" patch.\n\n[[File:Hells Angels-02-MJ.jpg|thumb|Hells Angels clubhouse in [[Oakland, California]]]]\nTo become a full member, the prospect must be voted on unanimously by the rest of the full club members.<ref name=bbcbarger/> Prior to votes being cast, a prospect usually travels to every charter in the sponsoring charter's geographic jurisdiction (state/province/territory) and introduces himself to every Full-Patch member. This process allows each voting member to become familiar with the subject and to ask any questions of concern prior to the vote. Some form of formal induction follows, wherein the prospect affirms his loyalty to the club and its members. The final logo patch (top \"Hells Angels\" rocker) is then awarded at this initiation ceremony. The step of attaining full membership can be referred to as \"being patched\".\n\nEven after a member is patched in, the patches themselves remain the property of HAMC rather than the member.

According to [[Ralph \"Sonny\" Barger]], founder of the [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] charter, early charters of the club were founded in [[San Francisco]], [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], [[San Bernardino, California|Fontana]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and elsewhere, with the members usually being unaware that there were other clubs. One of the lesser-known clubs existed in North [[Chino, California|Chino]]/South [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], in the late 1960s.\n\nOther sources claim that the Hells Angels in San Francisco were organized in 1953 by Rocky Graves, a Hells Angel member from [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] (\"Berdoo\"), implying that the \"Frisco\" Hells Angels were very much aware of their forebears.<ref>Birney Jarvis for ''Male'' magazine, 1964. Reprinted in ''Hells Angels'' by Hunter S. Thompson</ref> The \"Frisco\" Hells Angels were reorganized in 1955 with thirteen charter members, Frank Sadilek serving as President, and using the smaller, original logo. The Oakland charter, at the time headed by Barger, used a larger version of the \"Death's Head\" patch nicknamed the \"Barger Larger\", which was first used in 1959. It later became the club standard.\n\nThe Hells Angels are often depicted in semi-mythical romantic fashion like the 19th-century [[James\u2013Younger Gang]]: free-spirited, iconic, bound by brotherhood and loyalty. At other times, such as in the 1966 [[Roger Corman]] film ''[[The Wild Angels]]'', they are depicted as violent and nihilistic, little more than a violent criminal gang and a scourge on society.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bagnall |first=Sam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3311057.stm |title=Hells Angels: Easy-riders or criminal gang? |work=This World |publisher=BBC News |date=January 2, 2004 |accessdate=August 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe club became prominent within, and established its notoriety as part of the 1960s [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] movement in San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] scene, playing a part at many of the movement's seminal events. Members were directly connected to many of the counterculture's primary leaders, such as [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Jerry Garcia]] and the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Mick Farren]] and [[Tom Wolfe]].

Although the specific meaning of each patch is not publicly known, the patches identify specific or significant actions or beliefs of each biker.<ref>Gangs; A Journey into the heart of the British Underworld, Tony Thompson, (2004) {{ISBN|0-340-83053-0}}</ref> The official colors of the Hells Angels are red lettering displayed on a white background\u2014hence the club's nickname \"The Red and White\". These patches are worn on leather or denim jackets and vests.\n\nRed and white are also used to display the number 81 on many patches, as in \"Support 81, Route 81\". The 8 and 1 stand for the respective positions in the alphabet of ''H'' and ''A''. These are used by friends and supporters of the club in deference to club rules, which purport to restrict the wearing of Hells Angels imagery to club members. \nThe diamond-shaped [[Outlaw motorcycle club|one-percenter]] patch is also used, displaying '1%' in red on a white background with a red [[overlock|merrowed]] border. The term one-percenter is said to be a response to the [[American Motorcyclist Association]] (AMA) comment on the [[Hollister riot|Hollister incident]], to the effect that 99% of motorcyclists were law-abiding citizens and the last 1% were outlaws. The AMA has no record of such a statement to the press, and calls this story apocryphal.<ref name=Dulaney2005a>{{Cite news |last=Lindsey |first=Tom |periodical=International Journal of Motorcycle Studies |url=http://ijms.nova.edu/November2005/IJMS_Artcl.Dulaney.html |date=November 2005 |title=A Brief History of \"Outlaw\" Motorcycle Clubs |quote=The Life story caused something of a tumult around the country (Yates), and some authors have asserted that the AMA subsequently released a press statement disclaiming involvement in the Hollister event, stating that 99% of motorcyclists are good, decent, law-abiding citizens and that the AMA's ranks of motorcycle clubs were not involved in the debacle (e.g., Reynolds, Thompson). However, the American Motorcyclist Association has no record of ever releasing such a statement. Tom Lindsay, the AMA's Public Information Director, states 'We <nowiki>[the American Motorcyclist Association]</nowiki> acknowledge that the term 'one-percenter' has long been (and likely will continue to be) attributed to the American Motorcyclist Association, but we've been unable to attribute its original use to an AMA official or published statement\u2014so it's apocryphal.'}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hells Angels-03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|New York Hells Angels patch]]\nMost members wear a rectangular patch (again, white background with red letters and a red merrowed border) identifying their respective charter locations. Another similarly designed patch reads \"Hells Angels\". When applicable, members of the club wear a patch denoting their position or rank within the organization. The patch is rectangular and, similar to the patches described above, displays a white background with red letters and a red merrowed border. Some examples of the titles used are President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and [[Sergeant at Arms]]. This patch is usually worn above the 'club location' patch. Some members also wear a patch with the initials \"AFFA\", which stands for \"Angels Forever; Forever Angels\", referring to their lifelong membership in the biker club (i.e., \"once a member, always a member\").\n\nThe book ''Gangs'', written by Tony Thompson (a crime correspondent for ''[[The Observer]]''), states that [[Stephen Cunningham]], a member of the Angels, sported a new patch after he recovered from attempting to set a bomb, consisting of two Nazi-style SS lightning bolts below the words 'Filthy Few'. Some law enforcement officials claim that the patch is only awarded to those who have committed or are prepared to commit murder on behalf of the club. According to a report from the ''R. v. Bonner and Lindsay'' case in 2005 ''(see related section below)'', another patch, similar to the 'Filthy Few' patch is the 'Dequiallo' patch.

At the end of that stage, he is reclassified as \"prospect\", participating in some club activities, but not having voting privileges while he is evaluated for suitability as a full member.

Prospects are allowed to wear only a bottom rocker with the state or territory name along with the rectangular \"MC\" patch.\n\n[[File:Hells Angels-02-MJ.jpg|thumb|Hells Angels clubhouse in [[Oakland, California]]]]\nTo become a full member, the prospect must be voted on unanimously by the rest of the full club members.<ref name=bbcbarger/> Prior to votes being cast, a prospect usually travels to every charter in the sponsoring charter's geographic jurisdiction (state/province/territory) and introduces himself to every Full-Patch member. This process allows each voting member to become familiar with the subject and to ask any questions of concern prior to the vote. Some form of formal induction follows, wherein the prospect affirms his loyalty to the club and its members. The final logo patch (top \"Hells Angels\" rocker) is then awarded at this initiation ceremony. The step of attaining full membership can be referred to as \"being patched\".\n\nEven after a member is patched in, the patches themselves remain the property of HAMC rather than the member.

Both clubs were founding members of the new [[Nordkreis-Liga]] in 1909. These two teams merged in May 1911 to become ''Frankfurter Fu\u00dfball Verein (Kickers-Viktoria)'', an instant success, taking three league titles from 1912 to 1914 in the Nordkreis-Liga and qualifying for the Southern German championship in each of those seasons. In turn, ''Frankfurter FV'' joined the gymnastics club ''Frankfurter Turngemeinde von 1861'' to form ''TuS Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861'' in 1920. (The German word ''Eintracht'' means 'harmony, concord,' and ''Eintracht X'' is the equivalent of ''X United'' in English in the names of sports teams.<ref>''Harper Collins German Dictionary: German-English/English-German'' (Harpercollins, 1991; {{ISBN|0061002437}}), p. 203.</ref>)\n\n===Pre-Bundesliga history===\nAt the time, sports in Germany was dominated by nationalistic gymnastics organizations, and under pressure from that sport's governing authority, the gymnasts and footballers went their separate ways again in 1927, as ''Turngemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861'' and ''Sportgemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt (FFV) von 1899''.\n[[File:Eintracht Frankfurt Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of Eintracht Frankfurt league performance after WWII]]\n\nThrough the late 1920s and into the 1930s, Eintracht won a handful of local and regional championships, first in the [[Kreisliga Nordmain]], then in the [[Bezirksliga Main]] and [[Bezirksliga Main-Hessen]]. After being eliminated from the national level playoffs after quarterfinal losses in 1930 and 1931, they won their way to the final in 1932 where they were beaten 0\u20132 by [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], who claimed their first ever German championship. In 1933, German football was re-organized into sixteen Gauligen under the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and the club played first division football in the [[Gauliga S\u00fcdwest]], consistently finishing in the upper half of the table and winning their division in 1938.\n\nEintracht picked up where they left off after World War II, playing as a solid side in the first division [[Oberliga S\u00fcd (1945-63)|Oberliga S\u00fcd]] and capturing division titles in 1953 and 1959. Their biggest success came on the heels of that second divisional title as they went on to a 5\u20133 victory over local rivals [[Kickers Offenbach]] to take the 1959 German national title and followed up immediately with an outstanding run in the 1960 European Cup. Eintracht lost 3\u20137 to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in an exciting [[1960 European Cup Final|final]] that was widely regarded as one of the best football matches ever played,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philminshull/2010/05/the_great_european_cup_final_o.html|title=The great European Cup final of 1960 remembered|date=19 May 2010|publisher=BBC}}</ref> which included a [[List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks|hat-trick]] by [[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]] and four goals by [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]].\n\n{{League memberships of Eintracht Frankfurt}}\n\n===Founding member of the Bundesliga===\nThe side continued to play good football and earned themselves a place as one of the original 16 teams selected to play in the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league, formed in [[1963\u201364 Bundesliga|1963]]. Eintracht played Bundesliga football for 33 seasons, finishing in the top half of the table for the majority of them. Their best Bundesliga performances were five third-place finishes: they ended just two points back of champion [[VfB Stuttgart]] in [[1991\u201392 Bundesliga|1991\u201392]].\n\nThe team also narrowly avoided relegation on several occasions. In [[1983\u201384 Bundesliga|1984]], they defeated [[MSV Duisburg]] 6\u20131 on aggregate, and in [[1988\u201389 Bundesliga|1989]] they beat [[1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken]] 4\u20131 on aggregate, in two-game playoffs. Eintracht finally slipped and were relegated to [[2. Bundesliga]] for the 1996\u201397 season. At the time that they were sent down alongside [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]], these teams were two of only four sides that had been in the Bundesliga since the league's inaugural season.\n\nIt looked as though they would be out again in [[1998\u201399 Bundesliga|1998\u201399]], but they pulled through by beating defending champions Kaiserslautern 5\u20131, while [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]] unexpectedly lost at home to give Eintracht the break they needed to stay up. The following year, in another struggle to avoid relegation, the club was \"fined\" two points by the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) for financial misdeeds, but pulled through with a win by a late goal over [[SSV Ulm 1846|SSV Ulm]] on the last day of the season. The club was plagued by financial difficulties again in [[2003\u201304 Bundesliga|2004]] before once more being relegated.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2005, Eintracht bounced regularly between the top two divisions.\n\nThe [[2010\u201311 Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]] ended with the club's fourth Bundesliga relegation. After setting a new record for most points in the first half of the season, the club struggled after the winter break, going seven games without scoring a goal. Despite winning the next game, Frankfurt sacked coach [[Michael Skibbe]], replacing him with [[Christoph Daum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ger/news/newsid=1610804.html|title=Eintracht turn to Daum after Skibbe sacking|date=22 March 2011|publisher=UEFA}}</ref> The change in coaches did little to improve Eintracht's fortunes.

Eintracht famously lost the European Cup final to Real Madrid on 18 May 1960 at [[Hampden Park]] 7\u20133 in front of 127,621 spectators. In the match, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano scored three and [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]] scored the other four in Madrid's victory.\n\nIn [[1966\u201367 Intertoto Cup|1967]], Eintracht won the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]] after beating [[FK Inter Bratislava|Inter Bratislava]] in the final.\n\nEintracht won the [[DFB-Pokal]] in [[1973\u201374 DFB-Pokal|1974]], [[1974\u201375 DFB-Pokal|1975]], [[1980\u201381 DFB-Pokal|1981]], [[1987\u201388 DFB-Pokal|1988]] and in [[2017-18 DFB-Pokal|2018]], and took the UEFA Cup over another German team, [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]], in [[1979\u201380 UEFA Cup|1980]]. Also, Eintracht were the losing finalists in the [[2005\u201306 DFB-Pokal]]. Their opponents in the final, that year's Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich, previously qualified to participate in the Champions League. As a result, Eintracht, received the DFB-Pokal's winner's place in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], where they advanced to the group stage. In [[2016-17 DFB-Pokal|2017]] DFB-Pokal, they were defeated in the final match by Borussia Dortmund and made it the [[2017-18 DFB-Pokal|next year]] again into the final, which they won 3\u20131 against Bayern Munich. In [[2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League]], Eintracht reached the semi-finals of the competition, only losing on penalties to the eventual champions, [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/may/09/chelsea-v-eintracht-frankfurt-europa-league-semi-final-second-leg-live?page=with:block-5cd497828f086f179813e8a2#liveblog-navigation|title=Chelsea 1-1 Eintracht Frankfurt (2-2 agg, 4-3 pens): Europa League semi-final \u2013 as it happened|work=The Guardian|date=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nBesides playing friendlies against famous clubs from all of the world, Eintracht also played friendly matches against national teams from the following countries: [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]], [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], [[France national football team|France]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], [[Israel national football team|Israel]], [[Kenya national football team|Kenya]], [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]], [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]], [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysia]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] and [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]].{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Colours, crest and nicknames==\n[[File:Wappen Frankfurt am Main.svg|thumb|right|125px|Eintracht's crest is based on the city coat of arms.]]The club crest derives from the coat of arms of the city of [[Frankfurt]], which itself is a reference to the one-headed imperial eagle of the 13th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.holyromanempireassociation.com/heraldic-council-of-the-holy-roman-empire.html|title=The Heraldic Council of the Holy Roman Empire|last=|first=|date=|website=Holy Roman Empire Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe crest has evolved slowly over time, showing little significant change until 1980, when a stylized eagle in black and white was chosen to represent the team<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eintracht-archiv.de/adler/adler.html|title=Wappen|last=|first=|date=|website=Eintracht Archive|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>.

Both clubs were founding members of the new [[Nordkreis-Liga]] in 1909. These two teams merged in May 1911 to become ''Frankfurter Fu\u00dfball Verein (Kickers-Viktoria)'', an instant success, taking three league titles from 1912 to 1914 in the Nordkreis-Liga and qualifying for the Southern German championship in each of those seasons. In turn, ''Frankfurter FV'' joined the gymnastics club ''Frankfurter Turngemeinde von 1861'' to form ''TuS Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861'' in 1920. (The German word ''Eintracht'' means 'harmony, concord,' and ''Eintracht X'' is the equivalent of ''X United'' in English in the names of sports teams.<ref>''Harper Collins German Dictionary: German-English/English-German'' (Harpercollins, 1991; {{ISBN|0061002437}}), p. 203.</ref>)\n\n===Pre-Bundesliga history===\nAt the time, sports in Germany was dominated by nationalistic gymnastics organizations, and under pressure from that sport's governing authority, the gymnasts and footballers went their separate ways again in 1927, as ''Turngemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861'' and ''Sportgemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt (FFV) von 1899''.\n[[File:Eintracht Frankfurt Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of Eintracht Frankfurt league performance after WWII]]\n\nThrough the late 1920s and into the 1930s, Eintracht won a handful of local and regional championships, first in the [[Kreisliga Nordmain]], then in the [[Bezirksliga Main]] and [[Bezirksliga Main-Hessen]]. After being eliminated from the national level playoffs after quarterfinal losses in 1930 and 1931, they won their way to the final in 1932 where they were beaten 0\u20132 by [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], who claimed their first ever German championship. In 1933, German football was re-organized into sixteen Gauligen under the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and the club played first division football in the [[Gauliga S\u00fcdwest]], consistently finishing in the upper half of the table and winning their division in 1938.\n\nEintracht picked up where they left off after World War II, playing as a solid side in the first division [[Oberliga S\u00fcd (1945-63)|Oberliga S\u00fcd]] and capturing division titles in 1953 and 1959. Their biggest success came on the heels of that second divisional title as they went on to a 5\u20133 victory over local rivals [[Kickers Offenbach]] to take the 1959 German national title and followed up immediately with an outstanding run in the 1960 European Cup. Eintracht lost 3\u20137 to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in an exciting [[1960 European Cup Final|final]] that was widely regarded as one of the best football matches ever played,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philminshull/2010/05/the_great_european_cup_final_o.html|title=The great European Cup final of 1960 remembered|date=19 May 2010|publisher=BBC}}</ref> which included a [[List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks|hat-trick]] by [[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]] and four goals by [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]].\n\n{{League memberships of Eintracht Frankfurt}}\n\n===Founding member of the Bundesliga===\nThe side continued to play good football and earned themselves a place as one of the original 16 teams selected to play in the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league, formed in [[1963\u201364 Bundesliga|1963]]. Eintracht played Bundesliga football for 33 seasons, finishing in the top half of the table for the majority of them. Their best Bundesliga performances were five third-place finishes: they ended just two points back of champion [[VfB Stuttgart]] in [[1991\u201392 Bundesliga|1991\u201392]].\n\nThe team also narrowly avoided relegation on several occasions. In [[1983\u201384 Bundesliga|1984]], they defeated [[MSV Duisburg]] 6\u20131 on aggregate, and in [[1988\u201389 Bundesliga|1989]] they beat [[1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken]] 4\u20131 on aggregate, in two-game playoffs. Eintracht finally slipped and were relegated to [[2. Bundesliga]] for the 1996\u201397 season. At the time that they were sent down alongside [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]], these teams were two of only four sides that had been in the Bundesliga since the league's inaugural season.\n\nIt looked as though they would be out again in [[1998\u201399 Bundesliga|1998\u201399]], but they pulled through by beating defending champions Kaiserslautern 5\u20131, while [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]] unexpectedly lost at home to give Eintracht the break they needed to stay up. The following year, in another struggle to avoid relegation, the club was \"fined\" two points by the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) for financial misdeeds, but pulled through with a win by a late goal over [[SSV Ulm 1846|SSV Ulm]] on the last day of the season. The club was plagued by financial difficulties again in [[2003\u201304 Bundesliga|2004]] before once more being relegated.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2005, Eintracht bounced regularly between the top two divisions.\n\nThe [[2010\u201311 Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]] ended with the club's fourth Bundesliga relegation. After setting a new record for most points in the first half of the season, the club struggled after the winter break, going seven games without scoring a goal. Despite winning the next game, Frankfurt sacked coach [[Michael Skibbe]], replacing him with [[Christoph Daum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ger/news/newsid=1610804.html|title=Eintracht turn to Daum after Skibbe sacking|date=22 March 2011|publisher=UEFA}}</ref> The change in coaches did little to improve Eintracht's fortunes.

Eintracht famously lost the European Cup final to Real Madrid on 18 May 1960 at [[Hampden Park]] 7\u20133 in front of 127,621 spectators. In the match, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano scored three and [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]] scored the other four in Madrid's victory.\n\nIn [[1966\u201367 Intertoto Cup|1967]], Eintracht won the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]] after beating [[FK Inter Bratislava|Inter Bratislava]] in the final.\n\nEintracht won the [[DFB-Pokal]] in [[1973\u201374 DFB-Pokal|1974]], [[1974\u201375 DFB-Pokal|1975]], [[1980\u201381 DFB-Pokal|1981]], [[1987\u201388 DFB-Pokal|1988]] and in [[2017-18 DFB-Pokal|2018]], and took the UEFA Cup over another German team, [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]], in [[1979\u201380 UEFA Cup|1980]]. Also, Eintracht were the losing finalists in the [[2005\u201306 DFB-Pokal]]. Their opponents in the final, that year's Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich, previously qualified to participate in the Champions League. As a result, Eintracht, received the DFB-Pokal's winner's place in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], where they advanced to the group stage. In [[2016-17 DFB-Pokal|2017]] DFB-Pokal, they were defeated in the final match by Borussia Dortmund and made it the [[2017-18 DFB-Pokal|next year]] again into the final, which they won 3\u20131 against Bayern Munich. In [[2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League]], Eintracht reached the semi-finals of the competition, only losing on penalties to the eventual champions, [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/may/09/chelsea-v-eintracht-frankfurt-europa-league-semi-final-second-leg-live?page=with:block-5cd497828f086f179813e8a2#liveblog-navigation|title=Chelsea 1-1 Eintracht Frankfurt (2-2 agg, 4-3 pens): Europa League semi-final \u2013 as it happened|work=The Guardian|date=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nBesides playing friendlies against famous clubs from all of the world, Eintracht also played friendly matches against national teams from the following countries: [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]], [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], [[France national football team|France]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], [[Israel national football team|Israel]], [[Kenya national football team|Kenya]], [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]], [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]], [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysia]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] and [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]].{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Colours, crest and nicknames==\n[[File:Wappen Frankfurt am Main.svg|thumb|right|125px|Eintracht's crest is based on the city coat of arms.]]The club crest derives from the coat of arms of the city of [[Frankfurt]], which itself is a reference to the one-headed imperial eagle of the 13th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.holyromanempireassociation.com/heraldic-council-of-the-holy-roman-empire.html|title=The Heraldic Council of the Holy Roman Empire|last=|first=|date=|website=Holy Roman Empire Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe crest has evolved slowly over time, showing little significant change until 1980, when a stylized eagle in black and white was chosen to represent the team<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eintracht-archiv.de/adler/adler.html|title=Wappen|last=|first=|date=|website=Eintracht Archive|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>.

The series began on July 11, 1938, initially titled ''First Person Singular'', with the formula that Welles would play the lead in each show. Some months later the show was called ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]''.<ref name=\"Museum of Broadcasting radio collection\">\"An Interview with [[John Houseman]],\" ''Orson Welles on the Air: The Radio Years.'' New York: [[Paley Center for Media|The Museum of Broadcasting]], catalogue for exhibition October 28\u2013December 3, 1988, page 12</ref>\n\nWelles insisted his Mercury company \u2014 actors and crew \u2014 be involved in the radio series. This was an unprecedented and expensive request, especially for one so young as Welles. Most episodes dramatized works of classic and contemporary literature. It remains perhaps the most highly regarded radio drama anthology series ever broadcast, most likely due to the creativity of Orson Welles.\n\n''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'' was an hour-long program. Houseman wrote the early scripts for the series, turning the job over to [[Howard E. Koch]] at the beginning of October. Music for the program was composed and conducted by [[Bernard Herrmann]]. Their first radio production was [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', with Welles playing both Count Dracula and Doctor Seward. Other adaptations included ''[[Treasure Island]]'', ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'', ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''.\n\nOriginally scheduled for nine weeks, the network extended the run into the autumn, moving the show from its Monday night slot, where it was the summer substitute for the ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', to a Sunday night slot opposite [[Edgar Bergen]]'s popular variety show.\n\nThe early dramas in the series were praised by critics, but ratings were low. A single broadcast changed the program's ratings: the October 30, 1938 adaptation of [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]''. Possibly thousands of listeners thought Martians were in fact invading the earth, due to the faux-news quality of most of the broadcast. Significant publicity was generated, and ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'' quickly became one of radio's top-rated shows. The notoriety of \"The 'War of the Worlds\" had a welcome side effect of netting the show the sponsorship of [[Campbell's Soup]], guaranteeing its survival for a period, and beginning on December 9, 1938, the show was retitled ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]''.\n\n===''The Campbell Playhouse'' (1938\u20131940)===\n{{Main|The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)}}\nThe Mercury Theatre continued broadcasting 60-minute episodes in 1938\u201340, now sponsored by [[Campbell's Soup]] and punctuated by commercials. The company moved to [[Hollywood]] for their second season, and Hollywood stars began to be featured in guest roles. The programme was billed as \"The Campbell Playhouse presents the Mercury Theatre\". A full list of the 56 episodes can be found at ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]''.\n\n''The Campbell Playhouse'' briefly continued after Welles's final performance in March 1940, with a truncated third season broadcast thereafter without the Mercury Theatre, but it was not a success.\n\n===''The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air'' (1946)===\n{{Main|The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air}}\nThe Mercury troupe had disbanded by the time Welles made this series, commonly known as ''The Mercury Summer Theatre'', in the summer of 1946. Nonetheless, it carried the Mercury name, was produced, written, directed and presented by Welles (and often starred or co-starred him), and it combined abridged scriptings of old Mercury performances with new shows. Occasionally, former members of the troupe would guest star in the 30-minute program. The series had limited success, it only lasted 15 episodes, and it was not renewed for a further season.\n\n==Film==\n[[File:Citizen Kane Trailer (1940).webm|right|thumb|300px|thumbtime=218|[[Citizen Kane trailer|Trailer]] for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941)]]\n\n===Move to Hollywood===\nOrson Welles's notoriety following \"The War of the Worlds\" broadcast earned him Hollywood's interest, and [[RKO]] studio head [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George J. Schaefer]]'s unusual contract. Welles made a deal with Schaefer on July 21, 1939 to produce, direct, write, and act in three feature films. (The number of films was later changed - see below.) The studio had to approve the story and the budget if it exceeded $500,000. Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, cast his own actors and crew members, and have the privilege of final cut, unheard of at the time for a first-time director. (Welles later claimed that nobody in Hollywood had enjoyed this level of artistic freedom since [[Erich von Stroheim]] in the early 1920s.)<ref>''Arena: Orson Welles interview'' with Leslie Megahey, Episode 1 (1982)</ref> Additionally, as part of his contract, he set up a \"Mercury Unit\" at RKO; containing most of the actors from the Mercury's theatre and radio productions, as well as numerous technicians, (such as composer [[Bernard Herrmann]]), who were brought in from New York. Few of them had any film experience.\n\nWelles spent the first five months of his RKO contract learning the basics of making films, and trying to get several projects going with no success. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, \"They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there.\" First, Welles tried to adapt ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', but there was concern over the idea to depict it entirely with point of view shots, as Welles was unable to come up with an acceptable budget. Welles then considered adapting [[Cecil Day-Lewis]]' novel ''The Smiler With The Knife'', but realized that this relatively straightforward pulp thriller was unlikely to make much impact for his film debut. He concluded that to challenge himself with a new medium, he had to write an original story.\n\n===''Citizen Kane'' (1941)===\n{{Main|Citizen Kane}}\n\nAs Welles decided on an original [[Screenplay for Citizen Kane|screenplay for his first film]], he settled on a treatment he wrote, entitled ''American''. In its first draft, it was only partially based on [[William Randolph Hearst]], and also incorporated aspects of other tycoons such as [[Howard Hughes]]. However, ''American'' was heavily overlength, and Welles soon realised he would need an experienced co-writer to help redraft it\u2014preferably one with experience of working with tycoons.\n\nIn 1940, screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] was a former Hearst journalist recuperating from a car accident, and was in between jobs. He had originally been hired by Welles to work on ''The Campbell Playhouse'' radio program and was available to work on the screenplay for Welles's film. The writer had only received two screenplay credits between 1935 and his work on ''Citizen Kane'' and needed the job, his reputation having plummeted after he descended into alcoholism in the late 1930s. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a dispute amongst historians regarding whose idea it was to use [[William Randolph Hearst]] as the basis for Charles Foster Kane. For some time, Mankiewicz had wanted to write a screenplay about a public figure, perhaps a gangster, whose story would be told by the people that knew him. Welles claimed it was his idea to write about Hearst, while film critic [[Pauline Kael]] (in her widely publicised 1971 essay \"[[Raising Kane]]\") and Welles's former business partner John Houseman claim that it was Mankiewicz's idea. Kael further claimed that Welles had written nothing of the original script, and did not deserve a co-writer credit. However, in 1985, film historian Robert Carringer showed that Kael had only reached her conclusion by comparing the first and last drafts of the ''Citizen Kane'' script, whereas Carringer examined every intermediate draft by Mankiewicz and Welles, and concluded that a co-writer credit was justified, with each man writing between 40% and 60% of the script. He additionally concluded that Houseman's claims to have contributed to the script were largely unfounded.<ref>Robert L. Carringer, ''The Making of Citizen Kane'' (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1985)</ref>\n\nMankiewicz had already written an unperformed play entitled, ''The Tree Will Grow'' about [[John Dillinger]]. Welles liked the idea of multiple viewpoints but was not interested in playing Dillinger. Mankiewicz and Welles talked about picking someone else to use a model. They hit on the idea of using Hearst as their central character. Mankiewicz had frequented Hearst's parties until his alcoholism got him barred. The writer resented this and became obsessed with Hearst and [[Marion Davies]]. Hearst had great influence and the power to retaliate within Hollywood so Welles had Mankiewicz work on the script outside of the city. Because of the writer's drinking problem, Houseman went along to provide assistance and make sure that he stayed focused. Welles also sought inspiration from Howard Hughes and [[Samuel Insull]] (who built an opera house for his girlfriend). Although Mankiewicz and Houseman got on well with Welles, they incorporated some of his traits into Kane, such as his temper.\n\nDuring production, ''Citizen Kane'' was referred to as \"RKO 281\". Filming took place between June 29, 1940 and October 23, 1940 in what is now Stage 19 on the [[Paramount Pictures]] lot in Hollywood, and came in under schedule. Welles prevented studio executives of RKO from visiting the set. He understood their desire to control projects and he knew they were expecting him to do an exciting film that would correspond to his \"The War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast. Welles's RKO contract had given him complete control over the production of the film when he signed on with the studio, something that he never again was allowed to exercise when making motion pictures. According to an RKO cost sheet from May 1942, the film cost $839,727 compared to an estimated budget of $723,800.\n\nWhen the film was released, pressure from William Randolph Hearst led to many cinemas refusing to screen it, and it was screened in so few places that RKO made a substantial loss on the film on its original release. As a consequence of this, Welles's RKO contract was renegotiated, and he lost the right to control a film's final cut\u2014something which would have major consequences for his next film, ''The Magnificent Ambersons.''\n\n===''The Magnificent Ambersons'' (1942)===\n{{Main|The Magnificent Ambersons (film)}}\nWelles's follow-up to ''Citizen Kane'' was an adaptation of [[Booth Tarkington]]'s novel ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', a childhood favorite of his which he had already adapted for the radio. It portrayed the decline and fall of a proud Midwestern American family of the 19th century, as the motor car in the 20th century makes them obsolete.\n\nWelles's relations with RKO grew strained during the making of this film. His stock had fallen considerably after ''Kane'' had commercially flopped. Whereas studio head George Schaefer had given Welles ''carte blanche'' over ''Kane'', he closely supervised ''Ambersons'', sensing that his own position was in danger (which indeed it was - Schaefer was fired as head of RKO shortly after ''Ambersons'' was completed, and a commonly-attributed reason was for his having hired Welles with such a generous contract). RKO itself was in serious financial trouble, running a deficit.\n\nWelles himself considered his original cut of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' to have been one of his finest films - \"it was a much better picture than ''Kane''\". However, RKO panicked over a lukewarm preview screening in [[Pomona, California]], when the film ran second in a double-bill with a romantic comedy. Around 55% of the audience strongly disliked the film (although the surviving audience feedback cards show that the remaining minority gave fulsome praise, using words such as \"masterpiece\" and \"cinematic art\"). Welles was in Brazil filming ''It's All True'' (see below), so the studio decided to trim over 40 minutes of the film's two-hour running time.\n\nThe first half of the film, portraying the happy times of the Ambersons in the 19th century, was largely unaffected. However, the vast majority of the second half of the film, portraying the Ambersons' fall from grace, was largely discarded as too depressing. Actors were drafted in for reshoots by other directors, who shot new scenes, including an upbeat, optimistic ending out of key with the rest of the film. The discarded 40 minutes of scenes by Welles were burned, and detailed, telegraphed instructions from him suggesting further compromises to save the film were thrown away, unread. This truncated version of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' had a limited released in two Los Angeles cinemas in July 1942, where it did indifferently, and like ''Citizen Kane'', the film lost RKO hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nLater in 1942, George Schaefer was dismissed as studio head. One of the first changes initiated by his successor, Charles Koerner, was to fire Welles from RKO, and his entire Mercury unit was removed from the studio and closed down.\n\n===''Journey into Fear'' (1943) and ''It's All True'' (1942-1993)===\n{{Main|Journey into Fear (1943 film)|It's All True (film)}}\nWelles's RKO contract was renegotiated after the commercial failure of ''Citizen Kane''. Instead of delivering three major \"A-pictures\" for the studio, Welles would instead deliver two, and would compensate for the high costs of ''Citizen Kane'' by delivering two further films with lower budgets.\n\nOne of these was the straightforward espionage thriller ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey into Fear]]'', based on a novel by [[Eric Ambler]]. Welles wrote and produced the film, but opted not to be the main director, not least as the film was on a tight schedule, filming back-to-back with ''The Magnificent Ambersons''. The project appealed to RKO, especially as it seemed to be a low-risk, low-budget film.\n\nThe other project was first suggested by [[David Rockefeller]], and since Welles was qualified as medically unfit for war service, it was suggested he could render service to the war effort by making a film to encourage Pan-American sentiment, since the US State Department was worried about fascist sympathies in some Latin American countries. The film's concept was loosely defined as an anthology of stories about different Americans being united against fascism, and it was hoped that a Pan-American song-and-dance number could be recorded. In February 1942, Brazil's carnival season was rapidly approaching, so it was decided to quickly send Welles over with technicolour cameras to film the carnival, and he could decide how to use the film later.\n\nStudio director [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]] was heavily involved in both projects. Officially, he was the sole director of ''Journey into Fear''. However, studio documentation and photographs show Welles directing that film (often in costume for his supporting role as \"Colonel Haki\"), and fuelled by amphetamines, he was directing ''Ambersons'' in the day and ''Journey'' at night. He finished his ''Journey'' scenes in the small hours of the morning he left for Brazil, and Foster directed the rest of the film to Welles's specific instructions. RKO found ''Journey into Fear'' too eccentric in its original form, and kept the film for a year before releasing it in 1943, by which time they had cut over twenty minutes. As with ''Ambersons'', the excised footage was burned.\n\nWhile Welles was in Brazil, he sent Foster to Mexico to direct one of the sequences of ''It's All True'' (based on the short story \"My Friend Bonito\", about a boy and his donkey), while he began to develop the rest of the film. As well as working his carnival footage into a sequence on the history of Samba, he filmed a sequence called \"Four raftmen\", about an epic sea voyage undertaken by ''Jangedeiros'' fishermen to seek justice from Brazil's President.\n\nRKO rapidly turned against Welles and the ''It's All True'' project. Film historian Catherine Benamou has argued, based on extensive work in the RKO archives, that racism was a major underlying factor, and that RKO was alarmed that Welles was choosing to make non-white Americans the heroes of his story.<ref>Catherine Benamou, ''It's All True: Orson Welles's Pan-American Odyssey'' (University of California Press, Berkeley, California, 2007)</ref> As well as ignoring his instructions while the studio recut ''Ambersons'' and ''Journey'', they began issuing press releases attacking him for profligacy with studio funds, and accusing him of wasting his time in Brazil by attending lavish parties and drinking into the small hours (which he did - but fortified by amphetamines, he would also be the first to report for filming at 6am).<ref>Interview in ''[[It's All True (film)]]'', 1993 documentary</ref> When a filming accident resulted in one actor drowning, RKO cited this as an example of Welles's irresponsibility. Finally, they ordered him to abandon the film. Not wishing to leave, Welles remained in Brazil with a skeleton crew which he funded himself, but eventually had to return when he ran out of film and RKO refused to send him any more.\n\nAfter Welles was sacked in 1942, RKO had no plans for the ''It's All True'' footage. Some of it was dumped in the Pacific Ocean. Welles tried to buy back the negative, convinced he could fashion ''It's All True'' into a commercially successful film about samba, and he wrote the studio an \"IOU\" note for it, but when he could not afford the first installment on payments, the footage reverted to the studio. The footage was long presumed lost (though some of it was found again in 1985 and incorporated into a partial restoration in 1993), and Welles was unable to find a directing job for over three years, and even then, only for [[The Stranger (1946 film)|a formulaic low-budget thriller.]] In the meantime, the Mercury Theatre had disbanded for good.\n\n===Later cinema===\nThe Mercury Theatre production team of John Houseman and Orson Welles separated during the making of ''Citizen Kane'', but as the RKO Mercury unit retained its name until its removal from the studio in 1942. Since the Mercury Theatre name was not trademarked, Welles continued to use it for some of his subsequent projects. As well as the 1943 variety act ''The Mercury Wonder Show'' and the 1946 radio series ''The Mercury Summer Theatre''.\n\n===Mercury  Theatre actors in Welles's films===\nWelles cast a number of regular Mercury Theatre actors in his later films.

The company produced theatrical presentations, radio programs and motion pictures. The Mercury also released promptbooks and phonographic recordings of four Shakespeare works for use in schools.\n\nAfter a series of acclaimed Broadway productions, the Mercury Theatre progressed into its most popular incarnation as ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]''. The [[radio drama|radio]] series included one of the most notable and infamous radio broadcasts of all time, \"[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]\", broadcast October 30, 1938.

This was an entirely original play by Welles about [[Sir John Falstaff]], which was created by mixing and re-arranging  dialogue from five different [[Shakespeare]] plays (primarily taken from ''[[Henry IV, Part I]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part II]]'', and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', but also using elements of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''), to form a wholly new narrative. It opened on February 27, 1939, at the [[Colonial Theatre (Boston)|Colonial Theatre, Boston]], in a five-hour version playing from 8pm to 1am. As the title suggests, the play was intended to be the first of a two-part production, but although it opened in three other cities, poor box-office receipts meant that plan had to be abandoned, and ''Five Kings (Part One)'' never played in New York, while ''Five Kings (Part Two)'' was never produced at all.<ref name=\"Rosenbaum\"/>{{Rp|350\u2013351|date=October 2013}}\n\n''Five Kings'' was an intensely personal project for Welles, who would revive a substantially rewritten version of the play (retitled ''Chimes at Midnight'') in [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin]] in 1960, and would eventually [[Chimes at Midnight|make a film of it]], which he came to regard as his favourite of his own films.\n\n===''The Green Goddess'' (1939)===\nIn July and August 1939, after having signed a contract with the RKO film studio, the Mercury Theatre toured the RKO Vaudeville Theatre circuit with an abbreviated, twenty-minute production of the [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]] melodrama ''[[The Green Goddess (stage play)|The Green Goddess]]'', five minutes of which took the form of a film insert.

In the intervening period, the troupe focused on their radio show, which had begun in 1938 and continued until March 1940. Their last full play after moving to Hollywood was a stage adaptation of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s anti-racism novel ''[[Native Son]]''. It opened at the St. James's Theatre, New York, on March 24, 1941 (just a month before ''Citizen Kane'' premiered), and received excellent reviews, running to 114 performances.

The series began on July 11, 1938, initially titled ''First Person Singular'', with the formula that Welles would play the lead in each show. Some months later the show was called ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]''.<ref name=\"Museum of Broadcasting radio collection\">\"An Interview with [[John Houseman]],\" ''Orson Welles on the Air: The Radio Years.'' New York: [[Paley Center for Media|The Museum of Broadcasting]], catalogue for exhibition October 28\u2013December 3, 1988, page 12</ref>\n\nWelles insisted his Mercury company \u2014 actors and crew \u2014 be involved in the radio series. This was an unprecedented and expensive request, especially for one so young as Welles. Most episodes dramatized works of classic and contemporary literature. It remains perhaps the most highly regarded radio drama anthology series ever broadcast, most likely due to the creativity of Orson Welles.\n\n''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'' was an hour-long program. Houseman wrote the early scripts for the series, turning the job over to [[Howard E. Koch]] at the beginning of October. Music for the program was composed and conducted by [[Bernard Herrmann]]. Their first radio production was [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', with Welles playing both Count Dracula and Doctor Seward. Other adaptations included ''[[Treasure Island]]'', ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'', ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''.\n\nOriginally scheduled for nine weeks, the network extended the run into the autumn, moving the show from its Monday night slot, where it was the summer substitute for the ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', to a Sunday night slot opposite [[Edgar Bergen]]'s popular variety show.\n\nThe early dramas in the series were praised by critics, but ratings were low. A single broadcast changed the program's ratings: the October 30, 1938 adaptation of [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]''. Possibly thousands of listeners thought Martians were in fact invading the earth, due to the faux-news quality of most of the broadcast. Significant publicity was generated, and ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'' quickly became one of radio's top-rated shows. The notoriety of \"The 'War of the Worlds\" had a welcome side effect of netting the show the sponsorship of [[Campbell's Soup]], guaranteeing its survival for a period, and beginning on December 9, 1938, the show was retitled ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]''.\n\n===''The Campbell Playhouse'' (1938\u20131940)===\n{{Main|The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)}}\nThe Mercury Theatre continued broadcasting 60-minute episodes in 1938\u201340, now sponsored by [[Campbell's Soup]] and punctuated by commercials. The company moved to [[Hollywood]] for their second season, and Hollywood stars began to be featured in guest roles. The programme was billed as \"The Campbell Playhouse presents the Mercury Theatre\". A full list of the 56 episodes can be found at ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]''.\n\n''The Campbell Playhouse'' briefly continued after Welles's final performance in March 1940, with a truncated third season broadcast thereafter without the Mercury Theatre, but it was not a success.\n\n===''The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air'' (1946)===\n{{Main|The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air}}\nThe Mercury troupe had disbanded by the time Welles made this series, commonly known as ''The Mercury Summer Theatre'', in the summer of 1946. Nonetheless, it carried the Mercury name, was produced, written, directed and presented by Welles (and often starred or co-starred him), and it combined abridged scriptings of old Mercury performances with new shows. Occasionally, former members of the troupe would guest star in the 30-minute program. The series had limited success, it only lasted 15 episodes, and it was not renewed for a further season.\n\n==Film==\n[[File:Citizen Kane Trailer (1940).webm|right|thumb|300px|thumbtime=218|[[Citizen Kane trailer|Trailer]] for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941)]]\n\n===Move to Hollywood===\nOrson Welles's notoriety following \"The War of the Worlds\" broadcast earned him Hollywood's interest, and [[RKO]] studio head [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George J. Schaefer]]'s unusual contract. Welles made a deal with Schaefer on July 21, 1939 to produce, direct, write, and act in three feature films. (The number of films was later changed - see below.) The studio had to approve the story and the budget if it exceeded $500,000. Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, cast his own actors and crew members, and have the privilege of final cut, unheard of at the time for a first-time director. (Welles later claimed that nobody in Hollywood had enjoyed this level of artistic freedom since [[Erich von Stroheim]] in the early 1920s.)<ref>''Arena: Orson Welles interview'' with Leslie Megahey, Episode 1 (1982)</ref> Additionally, as part of his contract, he set up a \"Mercury Unit\" at RKO; containing most of the actors from the Mercury's theatre and radio productions, as well as numerous technicians, (such as composer [[Bernard Herrmann]]), who were brought in from New York. Few of them had any film experience.\n\nWelles spent the first five months of his RKO contract learning the basics of making films, and trying to get several projects going with no success. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, \"They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there.\" First, Welles tried to adapt ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', but there was concern over the idea to depict it entirely with point of view shots, as Welles was unable to come up with an acceptable budget. Welles then considered adapting [[Cecil Day-Lewis]]' novel ''The Smiler With The Knife'', but realized that this relatively straightforward pulp thriller was unlikely to make much impact for his film debut. He concluded that to challenge himself with a new medium, he had to write an original story.\n\n===''Citizen Kane'' (1941)===\n{{Main|Citizen Kane}}\n\nAs Welles decided on an original [[Screenplay for Citizen Kane|screenplay for his first film]], he settled on a treatment he wrote, entitled ''American''. In its first draft, it was only partially based on [[William Randolph Hearst]], and also incorporated aspects of other tycoons such as [[Howard Hughes]]. However, ''American'' was heavily overlength, and Welles soon realised he would need an experienced co-writer to help redraft it\u2014preferably one with experience of working with tycoons.\n\nIn 1940, screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] was a former Hearst journalist recuperating from a car accident, and was in between jobs. He had originally been hired by Welles to work on ''The Campbell Playhouse'' radio program and was available to work on the screenplay for Welles's film. The writer had only received two screenplay credits between 1935 and his work on ''Citizen Kane'' and needed the job, his reputation having plummeted after he descended into alcoholism in the late 1930s. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a dispute amongst historians regarding whose idea it was to use [[William Randolph Hearst]] as the basis for Charles Foster Kane. For some time, Mankiewicz had wanted to write a screenplay about a public figure, perhaps a gangster, whose story would be told by the people that knew him. Welles claimed it was his idea to write about Hearst, while film critic [[Pauline Kael]] (in her widely publicised 1971 essay \"[[Raising Kane]]\") and Welles's former business partner John Houseman claim that it was Mankiewicz's idea. Kael further claimed that Welles had written nothing of the original script, and did not deserve a co-writer credit. However, in 1985, film historian Robert Carringer showed that Kael had only reached her conclusion by comparing the first and last drafts of the ''Citizen Kane'' script, whereas Carringer examined every intermediate draft by Mankiewicz and Welles, and concluded that a co-writer credit was justified, with each man writing between 40% and 60% of the script. He additionally concluded that Houseman's claims to have contributed to the script were largely unfounded.<ref>Robert L. Carringer, ''The Making of Citizen Kane'' (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1985)</ref>\n\nMankiewicz had already written an unperformed play entitled, ''The Tree Will Grow'' about [[John Dillinger]]. Welles liked the idea of multiple viewpoints but was not interested in playing Dillinger. Mankiewicz and Welles talked about picking someone else to use a model. They hit on the idea of using Hearst as their central character. Mankiewicz had frequented Hearst's parties until his alcoholism got him barred. The writer resented this and became obsessed with Hearst and [[Marion Davies]]. Hearst had great influence and the power to retaliate within Hollywood so Welles had Mankiewicz work on the script outside of the city. Because of the writer's drinking problem, Houseman went along to provide assistance and make sure that he stayed focused. Welles also sought inspiration from Howard Hughes and [[Samuel Insull]] (who built an opera house for his girlfriend). Although Mankiewicz and Houseman got on well with Welles, they incorporated some of his traits into Kane, such as his temper.\n\nDuring production, ''Citizen Kane'' was referred to as \"RKO 281\". Filming took place between June 29, 1940 and October 23, 1940 in what is now Stage 19 on the [[Paramount Pictures]] lot in Hollywood, and came in under schedule. Welles prevented studio executives of RKO from visiting the set. He understood their desire to control projects and he knew they were expecting him to do an exciting film that would correspond to his \"The War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast. Welles's RKO contract had given him complete control over the production of the film when he signed on with the studio, something that he never again was allowed to exercise when making motion pictures. According to an RKO cost sheet from May 1942, the film cost $839,727 compared to an estimated budget of $723,800.\n\nWhen the film was released, pressure from William Randolph Hearst led to many cinemas refusing to screen it, and it was screened in so few places that RKO made a substantial loss on the film on its original release. As a consequence of this, Welles's RKO contract was renegotiated, and he lost the right to control a film's final cut\u2014something which would have major consequences for his next film, ''The Magnificent Ambersons.''\n\n===''The Magnificent Ambersons'' (1942)===\n{{Main|The Magnificent Ambersons (film)}}\nWelles's follow-up to ''Citizen Kane'' was an adaptation of [[Booth Tarkington]]'s novel ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', a childhood favorite of his which he had already adapted for the radio. It portrayed the decline and fall of a proud Midwestern American family of the 19th century, as the motor car in the 20th century makes them obsolete.\n\nWelles's relations with RKO grew strained during the making of this film. His stock had fallen considerably after ''Kane'' had commercially flopped. Whereas studio head George Schaefer had given Welles ''carte blanche'' over ''Kane'', he closely supervised ''Ambersons'', sensing that his own position was in danger (which indeed it was - Schaefer was fired as head of RKO shortly after ''Ambersons'' was completed, and a commonly-attributed reason was for his having hired Welles with such a generous contract). RKO itself was in serious financial trouble, running a deficit.\n\nWelles himself considered his original cut of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' to have been one of his finest films - \"it was a much better picture than ''Kane''\". However, RKO panicked over a lukewarm preview screening in [[Pomona, California]], when the film ran second in a double-bill with a romantic comedy. Around 55% of the audience strongly disliked the film (although the surviving audience feedback cards show that the remaining minority gave fulsome praise, using words such as \"masterpiece\" and \"cinematic art\"). Welles was in Brazil filming ''It's All True'' (see below), so the studio decided to trim over 40 minutes of the film's two-hour running time.\n\nThe first half of the film, portraying the happy times of the Ambersons in the 19th century, was largely unaffected. However, the vast majority of the second half of the film, portraying the Ambersons' fall from grace, was largely discarded as too depressing. Actors were drafted in for reshoots by other directors, who shot new scenes, including an upbeat, optimistic ending out of key with the rest of the film. The discarded 40 minutes of scenes by Welles were burned, and detailed, telegraphed instructions from him suggesting further compromises to save the film were thrown away, unread. This truncated version of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' had a limited released in two Los Angeles cinemas in July 1942, where it did indifferently, and like ''Citizen Kane'', the film lost RKO hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nLater in 1942, George Schaefer was dismissed as studio head. One of the first changes initiated by his successor, Charles Koerner, was to fire Welles from RKO, and his entire Mercury unit was removed from the studio and closed down.\n\n===''Journey into Fear'' (1943) and ''It's All True'' (1942-1993)===\n{{Main|Journey into Fear (1943 film)|It's All True (film)}}\nWelles's RKO contract was renegotiated after the commercial failure of ''Citizen Kane''. Instead of delivering three major \"A-pictures\" for the studio, Welles would instead deliver two, and would compensate for the high costs of ''Citizen Kane'' by delivering two further films with lower budgets.\n\nOne of these was the straightforward espionage thriller ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey into Fear]]'', based on a novel by [[Eric Ambler]]. Welles wrote and produced the film, but opted not to be the main director, not least as the film was on a tight schedule, filming back-to-back with ''The Magnificent Ambersons''. The project appealed to RKO, especially as it seemed to be a low-risk, low-budget film.\n\nThe other project was first suggested by [[David Rockefeller]], and since Welles was qualified as medically unfit for war service, it was suggested he could render service to the war effort by making a film to encourage Pan-American sentiment, since the US State Department was worried about fascist sympathies in some Latin American countries. The film's concept was loosely defined as an anthology of stories about different Americans being united against fascism, and it was hoped that a Pan-American song-and-dance number could be recorded. In February 1942, Brazil's carnival season was rapidly approaching, so it was decided to quickly send Welles over with technicolour cameras to film the carnival, and he could decide how to use the film later.\n\nStudio director [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]] was heavily involved in both projects. Officially, he was the sole director of ''Journey into Fear''. However, studio documentation and photographs show Welles directing that film (often in costume for his supporting role as \"Colonel Haki\"), and fuelled by amphetamines, he was directing ''Ambersons'' in the day and ''Journey'' at night. He finished his ''Journey'' scenes in the small hours of the morning he left for Brazil, and Foster directed the rest of the film to Welles's specific instructions. RKO found ''Journey into Fear'' too eccentric in its original form, and kept the film for a year before releasing it in 1943, by which time they had cut over twenty minutes. As with ''Ambersons'', the excised footage was burned.\n\nWhile Welles was in Brazil, he sent Foster to Mexico to direct one of the sequences of ''It's All True'' (based on the short story \"My Friend Bonito\", about a boy and his donkey), while he began to develop the rest of the film. As well as working his carnival footage into a sequence on the history of Samba, he filmed a sequence called \"Four raftmen\", about an epic sea voyage undertaken by ''Jangedeiros'' fishermen to seek justice from Brazil's President.\n\nRKO rapidly turned against Welles and the ''It's All True'' project. Film historian Catherine Benamou has argued, based on extensive work in the RKO archives, that racism was a major underlying factor, and that RKO was alarmed that Welles was choosing to make non-white Americans the heroes of his story.<ref>Catherine Benamou, ''It's All True: Orson Welles's Pan-American Odyssey'' (University of California Press, Berkeley, California, 2007)</ref> As well as ignoring his instructions while the studio recut ''Ambersons'' and ''Journey'', they began issuing press releases attacking him for profligacy with studio funds, and accusing him of wasting his time in Brazil by attending lavish parties and drinking into the small hours (which he did - but fortified by amphetamines, he would also be the first to report for filming at 6am).<ref>Interview in ''[[It's All True (film)]]'', 1993 documentary</ref> When a filming accident resulted in one actor drowning, RKO cited this as an example of Welles's irresponsibility. Finally, they ordered him to abandon the film. Not wishing to leave, Welles remained in Brazil with a skeleton crew which he funded himself, but eventually had to return when he ran out of film and RKO refused to send him any more.\n\nAfter Welles was sacked in 1942, RKO had no plans for the ''It's All True'' footage. Some of it was dumped in the Pacific Ocean. Welles tried to buy back the negative, convinced he could fashion ''It's All True'' into a commercially successful film about samba, and he wrote the studio an \"IOU\" note for it, but when he could not afford the first installment on payments, the footage reverted to the studio. The footage was long presumed lost (though some of it was found again in 1985 and incorporated into a partial restoration in 1993), and Welles was unable to find a directing job for over three years, and even then, only for [[The Stranger (1946 film)|a formulaic low-budget thriller.]] In the meantime, the Mercury Theatre had disbanded for good.\n\n===Later cinema===\nThe Mercury Theatre production team of John Houseman and Orson Welles separated during the making of ''Citizen Kane'', but as the RKO Mercury unit retained its name until its removal from the studio in 1942. Since the Mercury Theatre name was not trademarked, Welles continued to use it for some of his subsequent projects.

He submitted to their king and was taken captive to N\u00famenor.  He returned to Mordor a year after the downfall of N\u00famenor in 3320.\n\nIn 3429 Sauron attacked [[Gondor]], which resulted in [[Elendil]] and [[Gil-galad]] forming the army of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.  The host entered Mordor and besieged Barad-d\u00fbr from 3434\u20133441.  During the siege, Elendil's son An\u00e1rion was slain by a stone flung from the fortress.<ref>\"An\u00e1rion,\" ''The Thain\u2019s Book'',  http://thainsbook.net/gondorians.html#Anarion, Retrieved 18.00 Monday 5 January 2015</ref>  In 3441 Sauron himself came forth from the Dark Tower and fought against Elendil and Gil-galad.  Though they were killed in combat, Sauron was also cast down.  An\u00e1rion's brother [[Isildur]] cut the Ring from Sauron's hand and Sauron was overthrown.  Sauron's armies were defeated and Barad-d\u00fbr was captured and levelled to the ground.  However, the foundations could not be removed while the Ring still existed.\n\n===The Third Age===\n\nSauron had been exiled from Mordor which was under the guard of the men of Gondor for a time.  He subsequently built the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]] in [[Greenwood the Great]].  Due to the Great Plague, Gondor was unable to continue to man its forts, and Mordor was left unguarded from 1640.\n\nIn 2000 [[Minas Ithil]] was besieged by the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], and fell in 2002 and was renamed [[Minas Morgul]].

The barrel vault is a continuous arch, the length being greater than its diameter. As in building an arch, a temporary support is needed while rings of [[voussoir]]s are constructed and the rings placed in position. Until the topmost voussoir, the [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]], is positioned, the vault is not self-supporting. Where timber is easily obtained, this temporary support is provided by [[centering]] consisting of a framed [[truss]] with a semicircular or [[Circular segment|segmental]] head, which supports the voussoirs until the ring of the whole arch is completed. With a barrel vault, the centering can then be shifted on to support the next rings.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=956}}\n\nThe parts of a vault exert lateral [[thrust]] that requires a counter [[Friction|resistance]]. When vaults are built underground, the ground gives all the resistance required. However, when the vault is built above ground, various replacements are employed to supply the needed resistance. An example is the thicker walls used in the case of barrel or continuous vaults. [[Buttress]]es are used to supply resistance when intersecting vaults are employed.\n\n==Vault types==\n\n===Dome===\n{{main|Dome}}\n[[Image:Vault fig 01.gif|thumb|upright|left|Assyrian [[bas-relief]] from [[Nimrud]] showing domed structures in the background.]]\n\nAmongst the earliest known examples of any form of vaulting is to be found in the [[neolithic]] village of [[Khirokitia]] on [[Cyprus]]. Dating from {{circa|6000}} <small>[[Common era|BCE]]</small>, the circular buildings supported beehive shaped [[corbel]] domed vaults of unfired mud-bricks and also represent the first evidence for settlements with an upper floor. Similar [[beehive tomb]]s, called ''tholoi'', exist in [[Crete]] and Northern [[Iraq]]. Their construction differs from that at Khirokitia in that most appear partially buried and make provision for a [[wikt:dromos|dromos]] entry.\n\nThe inclusion of domes, however, represents a wider sense of the word vault. The distinction between the two is that a vault is essentially an [[arch]] which is extruded into the [[third dimension]], whereas a dome is an arch revolved around its [[vertical axis]].\n\n===Pitched brick barrel vault===\n[[File:Vo\u00fbte en tranches inclin\u00e9es.jpg|thumb|In a pitched-brick vault the bricks lean (are pitched) against an existing wall.]]\nPitched-brick vaults are named for their construction, the bricks are installed vertically (not radially) and are leaning (pitched) at an angle: This allows their construction to be completed without the use of centering. Examples have been found in archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia dating to the 2nd and 3rd millennium BCE,<ref>Lynne C. Lancaster, \"Early Examples of So-Called Pitched Brick Barrel Vaulting in Roman Greece and Asia Minor: A Question of Origin and Intention\"</ref> which were set in [[gypsum mortar]].\n\n===Barrel vault===\n{{main|Barrel vault}}\n[[File:St Paul's Cathedral Choir looking east, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|St Paul's Cathedral Choir looking east, London]]\n[[File:Barrel vault top force.jpg|thumb|upright|Pointed barrel vault showing direction of lateral forces.]]\nA barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault and resembles a barrel or tunnel cut lengthwise in half.

A similar system of construction was employed for the vault over the great hall at [[Ctesiphon]], where the material employed was fired bricks or tiles of great dimensions, cemented with mortar; but the span was close upon {{convert|83|ft|m}}, and the thickness of the vault was nearly {{convert|5|ft|m}} at the top, there being four rings of [[brickwork]].{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}\n\n[[Assyria]]n palaces used pitched-brick vaults, made with sun-dried mudbricks, for gates, subterranean graves and drains. During the reign of king [[Sennacherib]] they were used to construct aqueducts, such as those at [[Jerwan]]. In the provincial city [[D\u016br-Katlimmu]] they were used to created vaulted platforms. The tradition of their erection, however, would seem to have been handed down to their successors in [[Mesopotamia]], viz. to the [[Sassanid|Sassanians]], who in their palaces in [[Sarvestan]] and [[Firouzabad]] built domes of similar form to those shown in the Nimrud sculptures, the chief difference being that, constructed in [[rubble]] stone and cemented with mortar, they still exist, though probably abandoned on the [[Mohammed|Islamic]] invasion in the 7th century.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}\n\nIn all the instances above quoted in Sumer and Egypt the bricks, whether burnt or sun-dried, were of the description to which the term \"[[tile]]\" would now be given; the dimensions varied from {{convert|10|in|cm}} to {{convert|20|in|cm}} being generally square and about {{convert|2|in|cm}} to {{convert|4|in|cm}} thick, and they were not shaped as [[voussoir]]s, the connecting medium being thicker at the top than at the bottom. The earliest Egyptian examples of regular voussoirs in stone belong to the [[Egyptian chronology|XXVIth Dynasty]] ({{circa|650 BCE}}) in the additions made then to the temple of [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]], and here it is probable that centering of some kind was provided, as the vaults are built in rings, so that the same centering could be shifted on after the completion of each ring. The earliest example of regularly shaped voussoirs, and of about the same date, is found in the ''[[cloaca]]'' at [[Graviscae]] in [[Etruria]], with a span of about {{convert|14|ft|m}}, the voussoirs of which are from 5 to {{convert|6|ft|m}} long. The ''[[cloaca maxim]]a'' in Rome, built by [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] (603 BCE) to drain the marshy ground between the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] and the Capitoline Hills, was according to [[Commendatore Boni]] vaulted over in the 1st century BCE, the vault being over {{convert|800|ft|m}} long, {{convert|10|ft|m}} in span, with three concentric rings of voussoirs.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}\n\nThe enormous [[Taq-i Kasra|Eyvan-e Khosro]] at [[Ctesiphon]] (near present-day [[Baghdad]]) was built over 1,500 years ago during the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Sasanian]] period as a throne room.

When two semicircular barrel vaults of the same diameter cross one another <!---insert groin vault image---> their intersection (a true ellipse) is known as a [[groin vault]], down which the thrust of the vault is carried to the cross walls; if a series of two or more barrel vaults intersect one another, the weight is carried on to the piers at their intersection and the thrust is transmitted to the outer cross walls; thus in the Roman reservoir at [[Baiae]], known as the ''[[Piscina Mirabilis]]'', a series of five aisles with semicircular barrel vaults are intersected by twelve cross aisles, the vaults being carried on 48 piers and thick external walls. The width of these aisles being only about {{convert|13|ft|m}} there was no great difficulty in the construction of these vaults, but in the Roman [[Baths of Caracalla]] the [[tepidarium]] had a span of {{convert|80|ft|m}}, more than twice that of an English [[cathedral]], so that its construction both from the statical and economical point of view was of the greatest importance.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}<ref>[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Gm.html#anchor1070682 Artlex Art Dictionary]</ref>\nThe researches of M. Choisy (''L'Art de b\u00e2tir chez les Romains''), based on a minute examination of those portions of the vaults which still remain ''in situ'', have shown that, on a comparatively slight centering, consisting of trusses placed about {{convert|10|ft|m}} apart and covered with planks laid from truss to truss, were laid \u2013 to begin with \u2013 two layers of the Roman brick (measuring nearly {{convert|2|ft|m}} square and 2 in. thick); on these and on the trusses transverse rings of brick were built with longitudinal ties at intervals; on the brick layers and embedding the rings and cross ties [[concrete]] was thrown in horizontal layers, the haunches being filled in solid, and the surface sloped on either side and covered over with a tile roof of low pitch laid direct on the concrete. The rings relieved the centering from the weight imposed, and the two layers of bricks carried the concrete till it had set.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}\n\n[[Image:Groin vault plan force.jpg|thumb|Plan of a groin vault from above showing resultant outward thrust.]]\n[[Image:Groin vault top.jpg|thumb|upright|Groin vault from above.]]\nAs the walls carrying these vaults were also built in concrete with occasional bond courses of brick, the whole structure was homogeneous. One of the important ingredients of the mortar was a volcanic [[deposit (geology)|deposit]] found near Rome, known as [[pozzolana]], which, when the concrete had set, not only made the concrete as solid as the rock itself, but to a certain extent neutralized the thrust of the vaults, which formed shells equivalent to that of a metal lid; the Romans, however, do not seem to have recognized the value of this pozzolana mixture, for they otherwise provided amply for the counteracting of any thrust which might exist by the erection of cross walls and buttresses. In the [[tepidaria]] of the Thermae and in the [[Basilica of Maxentius|basilica of Constantine]], in order to bring the thrust well within the walls, the main barrel vault of the hall was brought forward on each side and rested on detached columns, which constituted the principal architectural decoration. In cases where the cross vaults intersecting were not of the same span as those of the main vault, the arches were either [[stilted]] so that their soffits might be of the same height, or they formed smaller intersections in the lower part of the vault; in both of these cases, however, the intersections or groins were twisted, for which it was very difficult to form a centering, and, moreover, they were of disagreeable effect: though every attempt was made to [[mask]] this in the decoration of the vault by panels and reliefs modelled in [[stucco]].{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}\n\nThe widest hall vaulted by the Romans was that of the throne room in the palace of [[Diocletian]] on the [[Palatine Hill]], and this had the enormous span of {{convert|100|ft|m}}, its thrust being counteracted by other halls on either side with buttresses outside. In provincial towns and in other parts of the Roman Empire, where the material pozzolana was not procurable, the Romans had to trust to their mortar as a cementing medium, but this, though excellent of its kind, was not of sufficient cohesive strength to allow of the erection of vaults of more than about {{convert|40|ft|m}} span, which were generally built in rubble [[masonry]]. There still exist in Asia Minor and [[Syria]] some vaulted halls, generally attached to thermae, which are carried on walls of great thickness. There were many varieties of the Roman vault, whether continuous or intersected, such as those employed over the corridors on the [[Colosseum]] and the [[theatre of Marcellus]], but in these cases the springing of the vault was above the summit of the arches of the main front, so that there was no intersection; on the other hand, over the corridors were either elliptical or semicircular, or over the staircases rising vaults, all of which were more difficult to construct; there were also numerous solutions of vault over circular halls, of which that of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] is the most important example, having a diameter of {{convert|142|ft|m}}, and over the hemicycles, which were sometimes of great size; that known as [[Canopus]] in [[Hadrian's Villa]] at [[tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] had a diameter of {{convert|75|ft|m}}, and was vaulted over with a series of ribs, between which were alternating rampant flat and semicircular webs and cells; in the same villa and in Rome were octagonal halls with various other combinations of vault. Another type of vault not yet referred to is that of the [[Tabularium]] [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] where the [[Cloister vault]] was employed. Fig. 3 compared with fig. 2 will show the difference; in the former the angles of intersection are inset, and in the latter they are groins with projecting angles at the base, which die away at the summit.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}}\n\n===Rib vault===\n{{main|Rib vault}}\n[[Image:Reims Cathedral, interior (4).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The rib vault of [[Reims Cathedral]], France.]]\nReference has been made to the rib vault in Roman work, where the intersecting barrel vaults were not of the same diameter. Their construction must at all times have been somewhat difficult, but where the barrel vaulting was carried round over the [[choir]] [[aisle]] and was intersected (as in [[St Bartholomew-the-Great]] in [[Smithfield, London]]) by semicones instead of cylinders, it became worse and the groins more complicated. This would seem to have led to a change of system and to the introduction of a new feature, which completely revolutionized the construction of the vault. Hitherto the intersecting features were geometrical surfaces, of which the diagonal groins were the intersections, elliptical in form, generally weak in construction and often twisting. The medieval builder reversed the process, and set up the diagonal ribs first, which were utilized as permanent centres, and on these he carried his vault or web, which henceforward took its shape from the ribs. Instead of the elliptical curve which was given by the intersection of two semicircular barrel vaults, or cylinders, he employed the semicircular arch for the diagonal ribs; this, however, raised the centre of the square bay vaulted above the level of the transverse arches and of the wall ribs, and thus gave the appearance of a dome to the vault, such as may be seen in the nave of [[Sant'Ambrogio, Florence]]. To meet this, at first the transverse and wall ribs were stilted, or the upper part of their arches was raised, as in the [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]] at [[Caen]], and the ''Abbey of Lessay'', in [[Normandy]]. The problem was ultimately solved by the introduction of the pointed arch for the transverse and wall ribs \u2013 the pointed arch had long been known and employed, on account of its much greater strength and of the less thrust it exerted on the walls. When employed for the ribs of a vault, however narrow the span might be, by adopting a pointed arch, its summit could be made to range in height with the diagonal rib; and, moreover, when utilized for the ribs of the [[annular vault]], as in the aisle round the [[apse|apsidal]] termination of the choir, it was not necessary that the half ribs on the outer side should be in the same plane as those of the inner side; for when the opposite ribs met in the centre of the annular vault, the thrust was equally transmitted from one to the other, and being already a broken arch the change of its direction was not noticeable.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=959}}\n\n[[Image:Fresco vault Gent.jpg|thumb|right|Rib vault of church Sint-Niklaaskerk in [[Ghent]], Belgium.]]\n[[File:Salisbury Cathedral, top of vaulted ceiling over nave.jpg|thumb|right|Top of the rib-vaulted ceiling over the nave of [[Salisbury Cathedral]].]]\n<!---The first introduction of the pointed arch rib would seem to have taken place in the choir aisles of the abbey of [[St Denis]], near [[Paris]], built by the [[Abbe Suger]] in 1135,--->The first introduction of the pointed arch rib took place at [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]] and pre-dated the abbey of [[Basilica of St Denis|St. Denis]]. Whilst the pointed rib-arch is often seen as an identifier for gothic architecture, Cefal\u00f9 is a romanesque cathedral whose masons experimented with the possibility of gothic rib-arches before it was widely adopted by western church architecture.<ref>[http://www.ikonosheritage.org/courses/docs/spring03/Architecture%20Web%20Doc%20v.4.pdf Basic architectural history course]</ref> It was in the church at [[Vezelay]] (1140) that it was extended to the square bay of the [[porch]]. Before entering into the question of the web or stone shell of the vault carried on the ribs, the earlier development of the great vaults which were thrown over the naves of a cathedral, or church, before the introduction of the pointed arch rib, shall here be noted. As has been pointed out, the aisles had already in the early Christian churches been covered over with groined vaults, the only advance made in the later developments being the introduction of transverse ribs' dividing the bays into square compartments; but when in the 12th century<ref>Transverse ribs under the vaulting surfaces had been employed from very early times by the Romans, and utilized as permanent stone centerings for their vaults; perhaps the earliest examples are those in the corridor of the [[Tabularium]] in Rome, which is divided into square bays, each vaulted with a cloister dome. Transverse ribs are also found in the Roman Piscinae and in the [[Nymphaeum]] at Nimes; they were not introduced by the Romanesque masons till the 11th century.</ref> the first attempts were made to vault over the naves, another difficulty presented itself, because the latter were twice the width of the aisles, so that it became necessary to include two bays of the aisles to form one square bay in the nave. This was an immense space to vault over, and  moreover, it followed that every alternate [[pier]] served no purpose, so far as the support of the nave vault was concerned, and this would seem to have suggested an alternative, viz. to provide a supplementary rib across the church and between the transverse ribs. This resulted in what is known as a sexpartite, or six-celled vault, of which one of the earliest examples is found in the ''Abbaye-aux-Hommes'' (S. Etienne) at [[Caen]]. This church, built by William the Conqueror, was originally constructed to carry a timber roof only, but nearly a century later the upper part of the nave walls were partly rebuilt, in order that it might be covered with a vault. The immense size, however, of the square vault over the nave necessitated some additional support, so that an intermediate rib was thrown across the church, dividing the square compartment into six cells, and called the [[sexpartite vault]] <!---insert sexpartite image--->\nthis was adopted in the cathedrals of [[Sens]] (1170), [[Laon]] (1195), [[Noyon]] (1190), Paris (1223\u20131235), and [[Bourges]] (1250). The intermediate rib, however, had the disadvantage of partially obscuring one side of the [[clerestory]] windows, and it threw unequal weights on the alternate piers, so that in the cathedral of [[Soissons]] (1205) a quadripartite or <!---insert quadripartite image--->four-celled vault was introduced, the width of each bay being half the span of the nave, and corresponding therefore with the aisle piers. To this there are some exceptions, in Sant' Ambrogio, Milan, and San Michele, [[Pavia]] (the original vault), and in the cathedrals of [[Speyer Cathedral|Speyer]], [[Mainz Cathedral|Mainz]] and [[Worms Cathedral|Worms]], where the quadripartite vaults are nearly square, the intermediate piers of the aisles being of much smaller dimensions. In England sexpartite vaults exist at [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]] (1175) (set out by [[William of Sens]]), [[Rochester Cathedral|Rochester]] (1200), [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] (1215), [[Durham Cathedral|Durham]] (east [[transept]]), and ''St. Faith's chapel'', [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=959}}\n<!---insert fig 9 with caption \"FIG. 9. - AB, springing of transverse and diagonal ribs; P, centre of the same; DE, longitudinal ridge rib; DF, intersection of webs; M, top of solid springer; KN, starting level of web; LK, springing of wall rib; EBD, bosses at intersection of ribs.\"--->\n\nIn the earlier stage of rib vaulting, the arched ribs consisted of independent or separate [[voussoir]]s down to the springing; the difficulty, however, of working the ribs separately led to two other important changes: (1) the lower part of the transverse diagonal and wall ribs were all worked out of one stone; and (2) the lower horizontal, constituting what is known as the [[tas-de-charge]] or solid [[springer (architecture)|springer]]. The tas-de-charge, or solid springer, had two advantages: (1) it enabled the stone courses to run straight through the wall, so as to bond the whole together much better; and (2) it lessened the span of the vault, which then required a centering of smaller dimensions. As soon as the ribs were completed, the web or stone shell of the vault was laid on them. In some English work each course of stone was of uniform height from one side to the other; but, as the diagonal rib was longer than either the transverse or wall rib, the courses dipped towards the former, and at the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] of the vault were cut to fit one another. In the early English Gothic period, in consequence of the great span of the vault and the very slight rise or curvature of the web, it was thought better to simplify the construction of the web by introducing intermediate ribs between the wall rib and the diagonal rib and between the diagonal and the transverse ribs; and in order to meet the thrust of these intermediate ribs a ridge rib was required, and the prolongation of this rib to the wall rib hid the junction of the web at the summit, which was not always very sightly, and constituted the ridge rib. In France, on the other hand, the web courses were always laid horizontally, and they are therefore of unequal height, increasing towards the diagonal rib. Each course also was given a slight rise in the centre, so as to increase its strength; this enabled the French masons to dispense with the intermediate rib, which was not introduced by them till the 15th century, and then more as a decorative than a constructive feature, as the domical form given to the French web rendered unnecessary the ridge rib, which, with some few exceptions, exists only in England. In both English and French vaulting centering was rarely required for the building of the web, a template (Fr. ''cerce'') being employed to support the stones of each ring until it was complete. In Italy, Germany and Spain the French method of building the web was adopted, with horizontal courses and a domical form. Sometimes, in the case of comparatively narrow compartments, and more especially in [[clerestory|clerestories]], the wall rib was stilted, and this caused a peculiar twisting of the web, where the springing of the wall rib is at K: to these twisted surfaces the term [[ploughshare vault]]ing is given.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|pp=959\u2013960}}\n\n[[Image:Lienzingen-Liebfrauenkirche 1.jpg|thumb|Rib-vault ceiling, with [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne ribs]], of the Liebfrauenkirche, [[M\u00fchlacker]] 1482.]]\nOne of the earliest examples of the introduction of the intermediate rib is found in the nave of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], and there the ridge rib is not carried to the wall rib. It was soon found, however, that the construction of the web was much facilitated by additional ribs, and consequently there was a tendency to increase their number, so that in the nave of [[Exeter]] Cathedral three intermediate ribs were provided between the wall rib and the diagonal rib. In order to mask the junction of the various ribs, their intersections were ornamented with richly carved bosses, and this practice increased on the introduction of another short rib, known as the lierne, a term in France given to the ridge rib. [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne ribs]] are short ribs crossing between the main ribs, and were employed chiefly as decorative features, as, for instance, in the ''Liebfrauenkirche'' (1482) of [[M\u00fchlacker]], Germany. One of the best examples of Lierne ribs exists in the vault of the [[oriel window]] of [[Crosby Hall, London]]. The tendency to increase the number of ribs led to singular results in some cases, as in the choir of [[Gloucester Cathedral]], where the ordinary diagonal ribs become mere ornamental [[molding (decorative)|mouldings]] on the surface of an intersected pointed barrel vault, and again in the cloisters, where the introduction of the [[fan vault]], forming a concave-sided [[conoid]], returned to the principles of the Roman geometrical vault. This is further shown in the construction of these fan vaults, for although in the earliest examples each of the ribs above the tas-de-charge was an independent feature, eventually it was found easier to carve them and the web out of the solid stone, so that the rib and web were purely decorative and had no constructional or independent functions.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=960}}\n\n===Fan vault===\n[[image:bath.abbey.fan.vault.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|Fan vaulting over the nave at [[Bath Abbey]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England]] \n{{main|Fan vault}}\nThe fan vault would seem to have owed its origin to the employment of centerings of one curve for all the ribs, instead of having separate centerings for the transverse, diagonal wall and intermediate ribs; it was facilitated also by the introduction of the four-centred arch, because the lower portion of the arch formed part of the fan, or conoid, and the upper part could be extended at pleasure with a greater radius across the vault. The simplest version is that found in the cloisters of Gloucester Cathedral, where the fans meet one another at the summit, so that there are only small compartments between the fans to be filled up. In later examples, as in [[King's College Chapel]], Cambridge, on account of the great dimensions of the vault, it was found necessary to introduce transverse ribs, which were required to give greater strength. Similar transverse ribs are found in [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s chapel and in the [[Divinity School, Oxford|Divinity School]] at [[Oxford]], where a new development presented itself. One of the defects of the fan vault at Gloucester is the appearance it gives of being half sunk in the wall; to remedy this, in the two buildings just quoted, the complete conoid is detached and treated as a [[pendant]].{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=960}}\n\n==Byzantine vaults and domes==\n[[Image:Hagia-Sophia-Laengsschnitt.jpg|thumb|left|Section through the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]].]]\nThe vault of the [[Basilica of Maxentius]], completed by Constantine, was the last great work carried out in Rome before its fall, and two centuries pass before the next important development is found in the [[Church of the Holy Wisdom]] (Hagia Sophia) at [[Constantinople]]. It is probable that the realization of the great advance in the science of vaulting shown in this church owed something to the eastern tradition of [[dome]] vaulting seen in the Assyrian domes, which are known to us only by the representations in the bas-relief from Nimrud, because in the great water cisterns in Istanbul, known as the [[Basilica Cistern]] and [[Bin bir direk]] (cistern with a thousand and one columns), we find the intersecting groin vaults of the Romans already replaced by small cupolas or domes. These domes, however, are of small dimensions when compared with that projected and carried out by [[Justinian]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]]. Previous to this the greatest dome was that of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] at Rome, but this was carried on an immense wall {{convert|20|ft|m}} thick, and with the exception of small niches or recesses in the thickness of the wall could not be extended, so that Justinian apparently instructed his architect to provide an immense [[hemicycle]] or [[apse]] at the eastern end, a similar apse at the western end, and great arches on either side, the walls under which would be pierced with windows.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}} Unlike the Pantheon dome, the upper portions of which are made of concrete, Byzantine domes were made of brick, which were lighter and thinner, but more vulnerable to the forces exerted onto them.\n\n[[Image:Vnejsiklenutisacrecoeur.jpg|thumb|right|[[Neo-Byzantine architecture|Neo-Byzantine]] vaults in [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] of the [[Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris]], France.]]\nThe [[diagram]] shows the outlines of the solution of the problem. If a hemispherical dome is cut by four vertical planes, the intersection gives four semicircular arches; if cut in addition by a horizontal plane tangent to the top of these arches, it describes a circle; that portion of the sphere which is below this circle and between the arches, forming a spherical [[spandril]], is the [[pendentive]], and its [[radius]] is equal to the [[diagonal]] of the square on which the four arches rest. Having obtained a circle for the base of the dome, it is not necessary that the upper portion of the dome should spring from the same level as the arches, or that its domical surface should be a continuation of that of the pendentive. The first and second dome of the Hagia Sophia apparently fell down, so that Justinian determined to raise it, possibly to give greater lightness to the structure, but mainly in order to obtain increased light for the interior of the church. This was effected by piercing it with forty windows \u2013 the effect of which, as the light streaming through these windows, gave the dome the appearance of being suspended in the air. The pendentive which carried the dome rested on four great arches, the thrust of those crossing the church being counteracted by immense buttresses which traversed the aisles, and the other two partly by smaller arches in the apse, the thrust being carried to the outer walls, and to a certain extent by the side walls which were built under the arches. From the description given by [[Procopius]] we gather that the centering employed for the great arches consisted of a wall erected to support them during their erection. The construction of the pendentives is not known, but it is surmised that to the top of the pendentives they were built in horizontal courses of brick, projecting one over the other, the projecting angles being cut off afterwards and covered with stucco in which the mosaics were embedded; this was the method employed in the erection of the P\u00e9rigordian domes, to which we shall return; these, however, were of less diameter than those of the Hagia Sophia, being only about 40 to {{convert|60|ft|m}} instead of {{convert|107|ft|m}} The apotheosis of [[Byzantine architecture]], in fact, was reached in Hagia Sophia, for although it formed the model on which all subsequent Byzantine churches were based, so far as their plan was concerned, no domes approaching the former in dimensions were even attempted. The principal difference in some later examples is that which took place in the form of the pendentive on which the dome was carried. Instead of the spherical spandril of Hagia Sophia, large niches were formed in the angles, as in the [[Umayyad Mosque|Mosque of Damascus]], which was built by Byzantine workmen for the [[Al-Walid I]] in CE 705; these gave an octagonal base on which the hemispherical dome rested; or again, as in the Sassanian palaces of Sarvestan and Firouzabad of the 4th and 5th century, when a series of concentric arch rings, projecting one in front of the other, were built, giving also an octagonal base; each of these pendentives is known as a [[squinch]].{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}}<!--- insert squinch diagram--->\n\n[[Image:Image-LittleHagiaSophiaInIstanbulDome.JPG|thumb|right|The dome of the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus]].]]\nThere is one other remarkable vault, also built by Justinian, in the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus]] in Constantinople. The central area of this church was octagonal on plan, and the dome is divided into sixteen compartments; of these eight consist of broad flat bands rising <!---insert squinch diagram--->from the centre of each of the walls, and the alternate eight are concave cells over the angles of the octagon, which externally and internally give to the roof the appearance of an umbrella.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}}\n\n==Romanesque==\n[[Image:Lisbon28.jpg|thumb|upright|Nave of [[Lisbon Cathedral]] with a barrel vaulted [[soffit]]. Note the absence of [[Clerestory|clerestory windows]], all of the light being provided by the [[Rose window]] at one end of the vault.]]\nAlthough the dome constitutes the principal characteristic of the Byzantine church, throughout Asia Minor are numerous examples in which the naves are vaulted with the semicircular barrel vault, and this is the type of vault found throughout the south of France in the 11th and 12th centuries, the only change being the occasional substitution of the pointed barrel vault, adopted not only on account of its exerting a less thrust, but because, as pointed out by Fergusson (vol. ii. p.&nbsp;46), the roofing tiles were laid directly on the vault and a less amount of filling in at the top was required.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}}\n\nThe continuous thrust of the barrel vault in these cases was met either by semicircular or pointed barrel vaults on the aisles, which had only half the span of the [[nave]]; of this there is an interesting example in the [[St John's Chapel, London|Chapel of Saint John]] in the [[Tower of London]] \u2013 and sometimes by half-barrel vaults. The great thickness of the walls, however, required in such constructions would seem to have led to another solution of the problem of roofing over churches with incombustible material, viz. that which is found throughout [[P\u00e9rigord]] and [[La Charente]], where a series of domes carried on pendentives covered over the nave, the chief peculiarities of these domes being the fact that the arches carrying them form part of the pendentives, which are all built in horizontal courses.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|pp=958\u2013959}}\n\nThe intersecting and groined vault of the Romans was employed in the early Christian churches in Rome, but only over the aisles, which were comparatively of small span, but in these there was a tendency to raise the centres of these vaults, which became slightly domical; in all these cases centering was employed.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=959}}\n\n==Gothic Revival and the Renaissance==\nOne of the most interesting{{peacock term|date=October 2016}} examples of the fan vault is that over the staircase leading to the hall of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], and here the complete conoid is displayed in its centre carried on a central column. This vault, not built until 1640, is an exceptional example of the long continuance of traditional workmanship, probably in Oxford transmitted in consequence of the late vaulting of the entrance gateways to the colleges. Fan vaulting is peculiar to England, the only example approaching it in France being the pendant of the [[Lady-chapel]] at [[Caudebec]], in Normandy.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=960}}\n\nIn France, Germany, and Spain the multiplication of ribs in the 15th century led to decorative vaults of various kinds, but with some singular modifications. Thus, in Germany, recognizing that the rib was no longer a necessary constructive feature, they cut it off abruptly, leaving a stump only; in France, on the other hand, they gave still more importance to the rib, by making it of greater depth, piercing it with [[tracery]] and hanging pendants from it, and the web became a horizontal stone paving laid on the top of these decorated vertical webs. This is the characteristic of the great Renaissance work in France and Spain; but it soon gave way to [[Italian culture|Italian]] influence, when the construction of vaults reverted to the geometrical surfaces of the Romans, without, however, always that economy in centering to which they had attached so much importance, and more especially in small structures. In large vaults, where it constituted an important expense, the chief boast of some of the most eminent architects has been that centering was dispensed with, as in the case of the dome of the [[Santa Maria del Fiore#Dome|Santa Maria del Fiore]] in [[Florence]], built by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], and Ferguson cites as an example the great dome of the church at <!---INSERT VARIOUS PLATE IMAGE--->Mousta in [[Malta]], erected in the first half of the 19th century, which was built entirely without centering of any kind.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|pp=960-961}}\n\n==Vaulting and faux-vaulting in the Renaissance and after==\n{{multiple image\n | width = 200\n | title = Internal and external rooves\n | image1 = Notre-Dame de Paris transverse section.svg\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = The Gothic [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] was built with a peaked timber roof (red) protecting its masonry [[nave]] vault (blue).\n | image2 = St Paul's Engraving by Samuel Wale and John Gwynn (1755)..gif\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = Cross-section of the dome of St. Paul's, London\n }}\nIt is important to note that whereas Roman vaults, like that of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], and [[Byzantine]] vaults, like that at [[Hagia Sophia]], were not protected from above (i.e. the vault from the inside was the same that one saw from the outside), the European architects of the Middle Ages protected their vaults with wooden roofs. In other words, one will not see a Gothic vault from the outside. The reasons for this development are hypothetical, but the fact that the roofed [[basilica]] form preceded the era when vaults begin to be made is certainly to be taken into consideration. In other words, the traditional image of a roof took precedence over the vault.\n\nThe separation between interior and exterior \u2013 and between structure and image \u2013 was to be developed very purposefully in the [[Renaissance]] and beyond, especially once the [[dome]] became reinstated in the Western tradition as a key element in church design. [[Michelangelo]]'s dome for [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, as redesigned between 1585 and 1590 by [[Giacomo della Porta]], for example, consists of two domes of which, however, only the inner is structural.

The barrel vault is a continuous arch, the length being greater than its diameter. As in building an arch, a temporary support is needed while rings of [[voussoir]]s are constructed and the rings placed in position. Until the topmost voussoir, the [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]], is positioned, the vault is not self-supporting. Where timber is easily obtained, this temporary support is provided by [[centering]] consisting of a framed [[truss]] with a semicircular or [[Circular segment|segmental]] head, which supports the voussoirs until the ring of the whole arch is completed. With a barrel vault, the centering can then be shifted on to support the next rings.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=956}}\n\nThe parts of a vault exert lateral [[thrust]] that requires a counter [[Friction|resistance]]. When vaults are built underground, the ground gives all the resistance required. However, when the vault is built above ground, various replacements are employed to supply the needed resistance. An example is the thicker walls used in the case of barrel or continuous vaults. [[Buttress]]es are used to supply resistance when intersecting vaults are employed.\n\n==Vault types==\n\n===Dome===\n{{main|Dome}}\n[[Image:Vault fig 01.gif|thumb|upright|left|Assyrian [[bas-relief]] from [[Nimrud]] showing domed structures in the background.]]\n\nAmongst the earliest known examples of any form of vaulting is to be found in the [[neolithic]] village of [[Khirokitia]] on [[Cyprus]].

Their construction differs from that at Khirokitia in that most appear partially buried and make provision for a [[wikt:dromos|dromos]] entry.\n\nThe inclusion of domes, however, represents a wider sense of the word vault.

A similar system of construction was employed for the vault over the great hall at [[Ctesiphon]], where the material employed was fired bricks or tiles of great dimensions, cemented with mortar; but the span was close upon {{convert|83|ft|m}}, and the thickness of the vault was nearly {{convert|5|ft|m}} at the top, there being four rings of [[brickwork]].{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}\n\n[[Assyria]]n palaces used pitched-brick vaults, made with sun-dried mudbricks, for gates, subterranean graves and drains. During the reign of king [[Sennacherib]] they were used to construct aqueducts, such as those at [[Jerwan]]. In the provincial city [[D\u016br-Katlimmu]] they were used to created vaulted platforms. The tradition of their erection, however, would seem to have been handed down to their successors in [[Mesopotamia]], viz. to the [[Sassanid|Sassanians]], who in their palaces in [[Sarvestan]] and [[Firouzabad]] built domes of similar form to those shown in the Nimrud sculptures, the chief difference being that, constructed in [[rubble]] stone and cemented with mortar, they still exist, though probably abandoned on the [[Mohammed|Islamic]] invasion in the 7th century.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}\n\nIn all the instances above quoted in Sumer and Egypt the bricks, whether burnt or sun-dried, were of the description to which the term \"[[tile]]\" would now be given; the dimensions varied from {{convert|10|in|cm}} to {{convert|20|in|cm}} being generally square and about {{convert|2|in|cm}} to {{convert|4|in|cm}} thick, and they were not shaped as [[voussoir]]s, the connecting medium being thicker at the top than at the bottom. The earliest Egyptian examples of regular voussoirs in stone belong to the [[Egyptian chronology|XXVIth Dynasty]] ({{circa|650 BCE}}) in the additions made then to the temple of [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]], and here it is probable that centering of some kind was provided, as the vaults are built in rings, so that the same centering could be shifted on after the completion of each ring. The earliest example of regularly shaped voussoirs, and of about the same date, is found in the ''[[cloaca]]'' at [[Graviscae]] in [[Etruria]], with a span of about {{convert|14|ft|m}}, the voussoirs of which are from 5 to {{convert|6|ft|m}} long. The ''[[cloaca maxim]]a'' in Rome, built by [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] (603 BCE) to drain the marshy ground between the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] and the Capitoline Hills, was according to [[Commendatore Boni]] vaulted over in the 1st century BCE, the vault being over {{convert|800|ft|m}} long, {{convert|10|ft|m}} in span, with three concentric rings of voussoirs.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}\n\nThe enormous [[Taq-i Kasra|Eyvan-e Khosro]] at [[Ctesiphon]] (near present-day [[Baghdad]]) was built over 1,500 years ago during the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Sasanian]] period as a throne room.

When two semicircular barrel vaults of the same diameter cross one another <!---insert groin vault image---> their intersection (a true ellipse) is known as a [[groin vault]], down which the thrust of the vault is carried to the cross walls; if a series of two or more barrel vaults intersect one another, the weight is carried on to the piers at their intersection and the thrust is transmitted to the outer cross walls; thus in the Roman reservoir at [[Baiae]], known as the ''[[Piscina Mirabilis]]'', a series of five aisles with semicircular barrel vaults are intersected by twelve cross aisles, the vaults being carried on 48 piers and thick external walls. The width of these aisles being only about {{convert|13|ft|m}} there was no great difficulty in the construction of these vaults, but in the Roman [[Baths of Caracalla]] the [[tepidarium]] had a span of {{convert|80|ft|m}}, more than twice that of an English [[cathedral]], so that its construction both from the statical and economical point of view was of the greatest importance.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}<ref>[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Gm.html#anchor1070682 Artlex Art Dictionary]</ref>\nThe researches of M. Choisy (''L'Art de b\u00e2tir chez les Romains''), based on a minute examination of those portions of the vaults which still remain ''in situ'', have shown that, on a comparatively slight centering, consisting of trusses placed about {{convert|10|ft|m}} apart and covered with planks laid from truss to truss, were laid \u2013 to begin with \u2013 two layers of the Roman brick (measuring nearly {{convert|2|ft|m}} square and 2 in. thick); on these and on the trusses transverse rings of brick were built with longitudinal ties at intervals; on the brick layers and embedding the rings and cross ties [[concrete]] was thrown in horizontal layers, the haunches being filled in solid, and the surface sloped on either side and covered over with a tile roof of low pitch laid direct on the concrete. The rings relieved the centering from the weight imposed, and the two layers of bricks carried the concrete till it had set.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}\n\n[[Image:Groin vault plan force.jpg|thumb|Plan of a groin vault from above showing resultant outward thrust.]]\n[[Image:Groin vault top.jpg|thumb|upright|Groin vault from above.]]\nAs the walls carrying these vaults were also built in concrete with occasional bond courses of brick, the whole structure was homogeneous. One of the important ingredients of the mortar was a volcanic [[deposit (geology)|deposit]] found near Rome, known as [[pozzolana]], which, when the concrete had set, not only made the concrete as solid as the rock itself, but to a certain extent neutralized the thrust of the vaults, which formed shells equivalent to that of a metal lid; the Romans, however, do not seem to have recognized the value of this pozzolana mixture, for they otherwise provided amply for the counteracting of any thrust which might exist by the erection of cross walls and buttresses. In the [[tepidaria]] of the Thermae and in the [[Basilica of Maxentius|basilica of Constantine]], in order to bring the thrust well within the walls, the main barrel vault of the hall was brought forward on each side and rested on detached columns, which constituted the principal architectural decoration. In cases where the cross vaults intersecting were not of the same span as those of the main vault, the arches were either [[stilted]] so that their soffits might be of the same height, or they formed smaller intersections in the lower part of the vault; in both of these cases, however, the intersections or groins were twisted, for which it was very difficult to form a centering, and, moreover, they were of disagreeable effect: though every attempt was made to [[mask]] this in the decoration of the vault by panels and reliefs modelled in [[stucco]].{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}}\n\nThe widest hall vaulted by the Romans was that of the throne room in the palace of [[Diocletian]] on the [[Palatine Hill]], and this had the enormous span of {{convert|100|ft|m}}, its thrust being counteracted by other halls on either side with buttresses outside. In provincial towns and in other parts of the Roman Empire, where the material pozzolana was not procurable, the Romans had to trust to their mortar as a cementing medium, but this, though excellent of its kind, was not of sufficient cohesive strength to allow of the erection of vaults of more than about {{convert|40|ft|m}} span, which were generally built in rubble [[masonry]]. There still exist in Asia Minor and [[Syria]] some vaulted halls, generally attached to thermae, which are carried on walls of great thickness. There were many varieties of the Roman vault, whether continuous or intersected, such as those employed over the corridors on the [[Colosseum]] and the [[theatre of Marcellus]], but in these cases the springing of the vault was above the summit of the arches of the main front, so that there was no intersection; on the other hand, over the corridors were either elliptical or semicircular, or over the staircases rising vaults, all of which were more difficult to construct; there were also numerous solutions of vault over circular halls, of which that of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] is the most important example, having a diameter of {{convert|142|ft|m}}, and over the hemicycles, which were sometimes of great size; that known as [[Canopus]] in [[Hadrian's Villa]] at [[tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] had a diameter of {{convert|75|ft|m}}, and was vaulted over with a series of ribs, between which were alternating rampant flat and semicircular webs and cells; in the same villa and in Rome were octagonal halls with various other combinations of vault. Another type of vault not yet referred to is that of the [[Tabularium]] [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] where the [[Cloister vault]] was employed. Fig. 3 compared with fig. 2 will show the difference; in the former the angles of intersection are inset, and in the latter they are groins with projecting angles at the base, which die away at the summit.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}}\n\n===Rib vault===\n{{main|Rib vault}}\n[[Image:Reims Cathedral, interior (4).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The rib vault of [[Reims Cathedral]], France.]]\nReference has been made to the rib vault in Roman work, where the intersecting barrel vaults were not of the same diameter. Their construction must at all times have been somewhat difficult, but where the barrel vaulting was carried round over the [[choir]] [[aisle]] and was intersected (as in [[St Bartholomew-the-Great]] in [[Smithfield, London]]) by semicones instead of cylinders, it became worse and the groins more complicated. This would seem to have led to a change of system and to the introduction of a new feature, which completely revolutionized the construction of the vault. Hitherto the intersecting features were geometrical surfaces, of which the diagonal groins were the intersections, elliptical in form, generally weak in construction and often twisting. The medieval builder reversed the process, and set up the diagonal ribs first, which were utilized as permanent centres, and on these he carried his vault or web, which henceforward took its shape from the ribs. Instead of the elliptical curve which was given by the intersection of two semicircular barrel vaults, or cylinders, he employed the semicircular arch for the diagonal ribs; this, however, raised the centre of the square bay vaulted above the level of the transverse arches and of the wall ribs, and thus gave the appearance of a dome to the vault, such as may be seen in the nave of [[Sant'Ambrogio, Florence]]. To meet this, at first the transverse and wall ribs were stilted, or the upper part of their arches was raised, as in the [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]] at [[Caen]], and the ''Abbey of Lessay'', in [[Normandy]]. The problem was ultimately solved by the introduction of the pointed arch for the transverse and wall ribs \u2013 the pointed arch had long been known and employed, on account of its much greater strength and of the less thrust it exerted on the walls. When employed for the ribs of a vault, however narrow the span might be, by adopting a pointed arch, its summit could be made to range in height with the diagonal rib; and, moreover, when utilized for the ribs of the [[annular vault]], as in the aisle round the [[apse|apsidal]] termination of the choir, it was not necessary that the half ribs on the outer side should be in the same plane as those of the inner side; for when the opposite ribs met in the centre of the annular vault, the thrust was equally transmitted from one to the other, and being already a broken arch the change of its direction was not noticeable.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=959}}\n\n[[Image:Fresco vault Gent.jpg|thumb|right|Rib vault of church Sint-Niklaaskerk in [[Ghent]], Belgium.]]\n[[File:Salisbury Cathedral, top of vaulted ceiling over nave.jpg|thumb|right|Top of the rib-vaulted ceiling over the nave of [[Salisbury Cathedral]].]]\n<!---The first introduction of the pointed arch rib would seem to have taken place in the choir aisles of the abbey of [[St Denis]], near [[Paris]], built by the [[Abbe Suger]] in 1135,--->The first introduction of the pointed arch rib took place at [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]] and pre-dated the abbey of [[Basilica of St Denis|St. Denis]]. Whilst the pointed rib-arch is often seen as an identifier for gothic architecture, Cefal\u00f9 is a romanesque cathedral whose masons experimented with the possibility of gothic rib-arches before it was widely adopted by western church architecture.<ref>[http://www.ikonosheritage.org/courses/docs/spring03/Architecture%20Web%20Doc%20v.4.pdf Basic architectural history course]</ref> It was in the church at [[Vezelay]] (1140) that it was extended to the square bay of the [[porch]]. Before entering into the question of the web or stone shell of the vault carried on the ribs, the earlier development of the great vaults which were thrown over the naves of a cathedral, or church, before the introduction of the pointed arch rib, shall here be noted. As has been pointed out, the aisles had already in the early Christian churches been covered over with groined vaults, the only advance made in the later developments being the introduction of transverse ribs' dividing the bays into square compartments; but when in the 12th century<ref>Transverse ribs under the vaulting surfaces had been employed from very early times by the Romans, and utilized as permanent stone centerings for their vaults; perhaps the earliest examples are those in the corridor of the [[Tabularium]] in Rome, which is divided into square bays, each vaulted with a cloister dome. Transverse ribs are also found in the Roman Piscinae and in the [[Nymphaeum]] at Nimes; they were not introduced by the Romanesque masons till the 11th century.</ref> the first attempts were made to vault over the naves, another difficulty presented itself, because the latter were twice the width of the aisles, so that it became necessary to include two bays of the aisles to form one square bay in the nave. This was an immense space to vault over, and  moreover, it followed that every alternate [[pier]] served no purpose, so far as the support of the nave vault was concerned, and this would seem to have suggested an alternative, viz. to provide a supplementary rib across the church and between the transverse ribs. This resulted in what is known as a sexpartite, or six-celled vault, of which one of the earliest examples is found in the ''Abbaye-aux-Hommes'' (S. Etienne) at [[Caen]]. This church, built by William the Conqueror, was originally constructed to carry a timber roof only, but nearly a century later the upper part of the nave walls were partly rebuilt, in order that it might be covered with a vault. The immense size, however, of the square vault over the nave necessitated some additional support, so that an intermediate rib was thrown across the church, dividing the square compartment into six cells, and called the [[sexpartite vault]] <!---insert sexpartite image--->\nthis was adopted in the cathedrals of [[Sens]] (1170), [[Laon]] (1195), [[Noyon]] (1190), Paris (1223\u20131235), and [[Bourges]] (1250). The intermediate rib, however, had the disadvantage of partially obscuring one side of the [[clerestory]] windows, and it threw unequal weights on the alternate piers, so that in the cathedral of [[Soissons]] (1205) a quadripartite or <!---insert quadripartite image--->four-celled vault was introduced, the width of each bay being half the span of the nave, and corresponding therefore with the aisle piers. To this there are some exceptions, in Sant' Ambrogio, Milan, and San Michele, [[Pavia]] (the original vault), and in the cathedrals of [[Speyer Cathedral|Speyer]], [[Mainz Cathedral|Mainz]] and [[Worms Cathedral|Worms]], where the quadripartite vaults are nearly square, the intermediate piers of the aisles being of much smaller dimensions. In England sexpartite vaults exist at [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]] (1175) (set out by [[William of Sens]]), [[Rochester Cathedral|Rochester]] (1200), [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] (1215), [[Durham Cathedral|Durham]] (east [[transept]]), and ''St. Faith's chapel'', [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=959}}\n<!---insert fig 9 with caption \"FIG. 9. - AB, springing of transverse and diagonal ribs; P, centre of the same; DE, longitudinal ridge rib; DF, intersection of webs; M, top of solid springer; KN, starting level of web; LK, springing of wall rib; EBD, bosses at intersection of ribs.\"--->\n\nIn the earlier stage of rib vaulting, the arched ribs consisted of independent or separate [[voussoir]]s down to the springing; the difficulty, however, of working the ribs separately led to two other important changes: (1) the lower part of the transverse diagonal and wall ribs were all worked out of one stone; and (2) the lower horizontal, constituting what is known as the [[tas-de-charge]] or solid [[springer (architecture)|springer]]. The tas-de-charge, or solid springer, had two advantages: (1) it enabled the stone courses to run straight through the wall, so as to bond the whole together much better; and (2) it lessened the span of the vault, which then required a centering of smaller dimensions. As soon as the ribs were completed, the web or stone shell of the vault was laid on them. In some English work each course of stone was of uniform height from one side to the other; but, as the diagonal rib was longer than either the transverse or wall rib, the courses dipped towards the former, and at the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] of the vault were cut to fit one another. In the early English Gothic period, in consequence of the great span of the vault and the very slight rise or curvature of the web, it was thought better to simplify the construction of the web by introducing intermediate ribs between the wall rib and the diagonal rib and between the diagonal and the transverse ribs; and in order to meet the thrust of these intermediate ribs a ridge rib was required, and the prolongation of this rib to the wall rib hid the junction of the web at the summit, which was not always very sightly, and constituted the ridge rib. In France, on the other hand, the web courses were always laid horizontally, and they are therefore of unequal height, increasing towards the diagonal rib. Each course also was given a slight rise in the centre, so as to increase its strength; this enabled the French masons to dispense with the intermediate rib, which was not introduced by them till the 15th century, and then more as a decorative than a constructive feature, as the domical form given to the French web rendered unnecessary the ridge rib, which, with some few exceptions, exists only in England. In both English and French vaulting centering was rarely required for the building of the web, a template (Fr. ''cerce'') being employed to support the stones of each ring until it was complete. In Italy, Germany and Spain the French method of building the web was adopted, with horizontal courses and a domical form. Sometimes, in the case of comparatively narrow compartments, and more especially in [[clerestory|clerestories]], the wall rib was stilted, and this caused a peculiar twisting of the web, where the springing of the wall rib is at K: to these twisted surfaces the term [[ploughshare vault]]ing is given.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|pp=959\u2013960}}\n\n[[Image:Lienzingen-Liebfrauenkirche 1.jpg|thumb|Rib-vault ceiling, with [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne ribs]], of the Liebfrauenkirche, [[M\u00fchlacker]] 1482.]]\nOne of the earliest examples of the introduction of the intermediate rib is found in the nave of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], and there the ridge rib is not carried to the wall rib. It was soon found, however, that the construction of the web was much facilitated by additional ribs, and consequently there was a tendency to increase their number, so that in the nave of [[Exeter]] Cathedral three intermediate ribs were provided between the wall rib and the diagonal rib. In order to mask the junction of the various ribs, their intersections were ornamented with richly carved bosses, and this practice increased on the introduction of another short rib, known as the lierne, a term in France given to the ridge rib. [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne ribs]] are short ribs crossing between the main ribs, and were employed chiefly as decorative features, as, for instance, in the ''Liebfrauenkirche'' (1482) of [[M\u00fchlacker]], Germany. One of the best examples of Lierne ribs exists in the vault of the [[oriel window]] of [[Crosby Hall, London]]. The tendency to increase the number of ribs led to singular results in some cases, as in the choir of [[Gloucester Cathedral]], where the ordinary diagonal ribs become mere ornamental [[molding (decorative)|mouldings]] on the surface of an intersected pointed barrel vault, and again in the cloisters, where the introduction of the [[fan vault]], forming a concave-sided [[conoid]], returned to the principles of the Roman geometrical vault. This is further shown in the construction of these fan vaults, for although in the earliest examples each of the ribs above the tas-de-charge was an independent feature, eventually it was found easier to carve them and the web out of the solid stone, so that the rib and web were purely decorative and had no constructional or independent functions.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=960}}\n\n===Fan vault===\n[[image:bath.abbey.fan.vault.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|Fan vaulting over the nave at [[Bath Abbey]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England]] \n{{main|Fan vault}}\nThe fan vault would seem to have owed its origin to the employment of centerings of one curve for all the ribs, instead of having separate centerings for the transverse, diagonal wall and intermediate ribs; it was facilitated also by the introduction of the four-centred arch, because the lower portion of the arch formed part of the fan, or conoid, and the upper part could be extended at pleasure with a greater radius across the vault. The simplest version is that found in the cloisters of Gloucester Cathedral, where the fans meet one another at the summit, so that there are only small compartments between the fans to be filled up. In later examples, as in [[King's College Chapel]], Cambridge, on account of the great dimensions of the vault, it was found necessary to introduce transverse ribs, which were required to give greater strength. Similar transverse ribs are found in [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s chapel and in the [[Divinity School, Oxford|Divinity School]] at [[Oxford]], where a new development presented itself. One of the defects of the fan vault at Gloucester is the appearance it gives of being half sunk in the wall; to remedy this, in the two buildings just quoted, the complete conoid is detached and treated as a [[pendant]].{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=960}}\n\n==Byzantine vaults and domes==\n[[Image:Hagia-Sophia-Laengsschnitt.jpg|thumb|left|Section through the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]].]]\nThe vault of the [[Basilica of Maxentius]], completed by Constantine, was the last great work carried out in Rome before its fall, and two centuries pass before the next important development is found in the [[Church of the Holy Wisdom]] (Hagia Sophia) at [[Constantinople]]. It is probable that the realization of the great advance in the science of vaulting shown in this church owed something to the eastern tradition of [[dome]] vaulting seen in the Assyrian domes, which are known to us only by the representations in the bas-relief from Nimrud, because in the great water cisterns in Istanbul, known as the [[Basilica Cistern]] and [[Bin bir direk]] (cistern with a thousand and one columns), we find the intersecting groin vaults of the Romans already replaced by small cupolas or domes. These domes, however, are of small dimensions when compared with that projected and carried out by [[Justinian]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]]. Previous to this the greatest dome was that of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] at Rome, but this was carried on an immense wall {{convert|20|ft|m}} thick, and with the exception of small niches or recesses in the thickness of the wall could not be extended, so that Justinian apparently instructed his architect to provide an immense [[hemicycle]] or [[apse]] at the eastern end, a similar apse at the western end, and great arches on either side, the walls under which would be pierced with windows.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}} Unlike the Pantheon dome, the upper portions of which are made of concrete, Byzantine domes were made of brick, which were lighter and thinner, but more vulnerable to the forces exerted onto them.\n\n[[Image:Vnejsiklenutisacrecoeur.jpg|thumb|right|[[Neo-Byzantine architecture|Neo-Byzantine]] vaults in [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] of the [[Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris]], France.]]\nThe [[diagram]] shows the outlines of the solution of the problem. If a hemispherical dome is cut by four vertical planes, the intersection gives four semicircular arches; if cut in addition by a horizontal plane tangent to the top of these arches, it describes a circle; that portion of the sphere which is below this circle and between the arches, forming a spherical [[spandril]], is the [[pendentive]], and its [[radius]] is equal to the [[diagonal]] of the square on which the four arches rest. Having obtained a circle for the base of the dome, it is not necessary that the upper portion of the dome should spring from the same level as the arches, or that its domical surface should be a continuation of that of the pendentive. The first and second dome of the Hagia Sophia apparently fell down, so that Justinian determined to raise it, possibly to give greater lightness to the structure, but mainly in order to obtain increased light for the interior of the church. This was effected by piercing it with forty windows \u2013 the effect of which, as the light streaming through these windows, gave the dome the appearance of being suspended in the air. The pendentive which carried the dome rested on four great arches, the thrust of those crossing the church being counteracted by immense buttresses which traversed the aisles, and the other two partly by smaller arches in the apse, the thrust being carried to the outer walls, and to a certain extent by the side walls which were built under the arches. From the description given by [[Procopius]] we gather that the centering employed for the great arches consisted of a wall erected to support them during their erection. The construction of the pendentives is not known, but it is surmised that to the top of the pendentives they were built in horizontal courses of brick, projecting one over the other, the projecting angles being cut off afterwards and covered with stucco in which the mosaics were embedded; this was the method employed in the erection of the P\u00e9rigordian domes, to which we shall return; these, however, were of less diameter than those of the Hagia Sophia, being only about 40 to {{convert|60|ft|m}} instead of {{convert|107|ft|m}} The apotheosis of [[Byzantine architecture]], in fact, was reached in Hagia Sophia, for although it formed the model on which all subsequent Byzantine churches were based, so far as their plan was concerned, no domes approaching the former in dimensions were even attempted. The principal difference in some later examples is that which took place in the form of the pendentive on which the dome was carried. Instead of the spherical spandril of Hagia Sophia, large niches were formed in the angles, as in the [[Umayyad Mosque|Mosque of Damascus]], which was built by Byzantine workmen for the [[Al-Walid I]] in CE 705; these gave an octagonal base on which the hemispherical dome rested; or again, as in the Sassanian palaces of Sarvestan and Firouzabad of the 4th and 5th century, when a series of concentric arch rings, projecting one in front of the other, were built, giving also an octagonal base; each of these pendentives is known as a [[squinch]].{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}}<!--- insert squinch diagram--->\n\n[[Image:Image-LittleHagiaSophiaInIstanbulDome.JPG|thumb|right|The dome of the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus]].]]\nThere is one other remarkable vault, also built by Justinian, in the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus]] in Constantinople. The central area of this church was octagonal on plan, and the dome is divided into sixteen compartments; of these eight consist of broad flat bands rising <!---insert squinch diagram--->from the centre of each of the walls, and the alternate eight are concave cells over the angles of the octagon, which externally and internally give to the roof the appearance of an umbrella.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}}\n\n==Romanesque==\n[[Image:Lisbon28.jpg|thumb|upright|Nave of [[Lisbon Cathedral]] with a barrel vaulted [[soffit]]. Note the absence of [[Clerestory|clerestory windows]], all of the light being provided by the [[Rose window]] at one end of the vault.]]\nAlthough the dome constitutes the principal characteristic of the Byzantine church, throughout Asia Minor are numerous examples in which the naves are vaulted with the semicircular barrel vault, and this is the type of vault found throughout the south of France in the 11th and 12th centuries, the only change being the occasional substitution of the pointed barrel vault, adopted not only on account of its exerting a less thrust, but because, as pointed out by Fergusson (vol. ii. p.&nbsp;46), the roofing tiles were laid directly on the vault and a less amount of filling in at the top was required.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=958}}\n\nThe continuous thrust of the barrel vault in these cases was met either by semicircular or pointed barrel vaults on the aisles, which had only half the span of the [[nave]]; of this there is an interesting example in the [[St John's Chapel, London|Chapel of Saint John]] in the [[Tower of London]] - and sometimes by half-barrel vaults. The great thickness of the walls, however, required in such constructions would seem to have led to another solution of the problem of roofing over churches with incombustible material, viz. that which is found throughout [[P\u00e9rigord]] and [[La Charente]], where a series of domes carried on pendentives covered over the nave, the chief peculiarities of these domes being the fact that the arches carrying them form part of the pendentives, which are all built in horizontal courses.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|pp=958\u2013959}}\n\nThe intersecting and groined vault of the Romans was employed in the early Christian churches in Rome, but only over the aisles, which were comparatively of small span, but in these there was a tendency to raise the centres of these vaults, which became slightly domical; in all these cases centering was employed.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=959}}\n\n==Gothic Revival and the Renaissance==\nOne of the most interesting{{peacock term|date=October 2016}} examples of the fan vault is that over the staircase leading to the hall of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], and here the complete conoid is displayed in its centre carried on a central column. This vault, not built until 1640, is an exceptional example of the long continuance of traditional workmanship, probably in Oxford transmitted in consequence of the late vaulting of the entrance gateways to the colleges. Fan vaulting is peculiar to England, the only example approaching it in France being the pendant of the [[Lady-chapel]] at [[Caudebec]], in Normandy.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=960}}\n\nIn France, Germany, and Spain the multiplication of ribs in the 15th century led to decorative vaults of various kinds, but with some singular modifications. Thus, in Germany, recognizing that the rib was no longer a necessary constructive feature, they cut it off abruptly, leaving a stump only; in France, on the other hand, they gave still more importance to the rib, by making it of greater depth, piercing it with [[tracery]] and hanging pendants from it, and the web became a horizontal stone paving laid on the top of these decorated vertical webs. This is the characteristic of the great Renaissance work in France and Spain; but it soon gave way to [[Italian culture|Italian]] influence, when the construction of vaults reverted to the geometrical surfaces of the Romans, without, however, always that economy in centering to which they had attached so much importance, and more especially in small structures. In large vaults, where it constituted an important expense, the chief boast of some of the most eminent architects has been that centering was dispensed with, as in the case of the dome of the [[Santa Maria del Fiore#Dome|Santa Maria del Fiore]] in [[Florence]], built by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], and Ferguson cites as an example the great dome of the church at <!---INSERT VARIOUS PLATE IMAGE--->Mousta in [[Malta]], erected in the first half of the 19th century, which was built entirely without centering of any kind.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|pp=960-961}}\n\n==Vaulting and faux-vaulting in the Renaissance and after==\n{{multiple image\n | width = 200\n | title = Internal and external rooves\n | image1 = Notre-Dame de Paris transverse section.svg\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = The Gothic [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] was built with a peaked timber roof (red) protecting its masonry [[nave]] vault (blue).\n | image2 = St Paul's Engraving by Samuel Wale and John Gwynn (1755)..gif\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = Cross-section of the dome of St. Paul's, London\n }}\nIt is important to note that whereas Roman vaults, like that of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], and [[Byzantine]] vaults, like that at [[Hagia Sophia]], were not protected from above (i.e. the vault from the inside was the same that one saw from the outside), the European architects of the Middle Ages protected their vaults with wooden roofs. In other words, one will not see a Gothic vault from the outside. The reasons for this development are hypothetical, but the fact that the roofed [[basilica]] form preceded the era when vaults begin to be made is certainly to be taken into consideration. In other words, the traditional image of a roof took precedence over the vault.\n\nThe separation between interior and exterior \u2013 and between structure and image \u2013 was to be developed very purposefully in the [[Renaissance]] and beyond, especially once the [[dome]] became reinstated in the Western tradition as a key element in church design. [[Michelangelo]]'s dome for [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, as redesigned between 1585 and 1590 by [[Giacomo della Porta]], for example, consists of two domes of which, however, only the inner is structural. [[Baltasar Neumann]], in his [[baroque]] churches, perfected light-weight plaster vaults supported by wooden frames.<ref>Maren Holst.  ''Studien zu Balthasar Neumanns W\u00f6lbformen'' (Mittenwald: M\u00e4ander, 1981).</ref> These vaults, which exerted no lateral pressures, were perfectly suited for elaborate ceiling frescoes. In [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London there is a highly complex system of vaults and faux-vaults.<ref>{{Cite book\n  |first=Vaughan  |last=Hart\n  |title=St. Paul's Cathedral: Sir Christopher Wren\n  |publisher=Phaidon Press  |location=London\n  |year=1995\n}}</ref> The dome that one sees from the outside is not a vault, but a relatively light-weight wooden-framed structure resting on an invisible \u2013 and for its age highly original \u2013 [[catenary arch|catenary]] vault of brick, below which is another dome, (the dome that one sees from the inside), but of plaster supported by a wood frame. From the inside, one can easily assume that one is looking at the same vault that one sees from the outside.\n\n==India==\n[[File:Adil Shah's Tomb, Inside Gol Gumbaz, Bijapur, Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left|Vaults and dome of the Gol Gumbaz]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:BaraKaram.jpg|thumb|The incomplete mausolueum of Adil Shah, Barakaman (Ali Roza-II), which means twelve arches in [[Urdu]]]] -->\nThere are two distinctive \"other ribbed vaults\" (called \"Karbandi\" in Persian) in India which form no part of the development of European vaults, but have some unusual features; one carries the central dome of the [[Jumma Musjid]] at [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]] (A.D. 1559), and the other is [[Gol Gumbaz]], the tomb of [[Muhammad Adil Shah II]] (1626\u20131660) in the same town. The vault of the latter was constructed over a hall {{convert|135|ft|m}} square, to carry a hemispherical dome. The ribs, instead of being carried across the angles only, thus giving an octagonal base for the dome, are carried across to the further pier of the octagon and consequently intersect one another, reducing the central opening to {{convert|97|ft|m}} in diameter, and, by the weight of the masonry they carry, serving as counterpoise to the thrust of the dome, which is set back so as to leave a passage about {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide round the interior. The internal diameter of the dome is {{convert|124|ft|m}}, its height {{convert|175|ft|m}} and the ribs struck from four centres have their springing {{convert|57|ft|m}} from the floor of the hall. The Jumma Musjid dome was of smaller dimensions, on a square of {{convert|70|ft|m}} with a diameter of {{convert|57|ft|m}}, and was carried on piers only instead of immensely thick walls as in the tomb; but any thrust which might exist was counteracted by its transmission across aisles to the outer wall.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=961}}\n\n==Islamic architecture==\nThe [[Muqarnas]] is a form of vaulting common in [[Islamic architecture]].\n\n==Modern vaults==\n[[File:Spomen Hram Svetog Save unutrasnost.png|thumb|250px|Neobyzantine vaults in [[Church of Saint Sava|Saint Sava]].

After winning the famous [[2000 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] race in 2000 with [[Jason Bargwanna]], he found limited success.\n\nTander was the winner of the first [[2002 Bathurst 24 Hour|Bathurst 24hr]] race driving a modified [[Holden Monaro 427C]] running a 7.0L (427cui) motor rather than the 5.7L Gen III that the road car runs. He co-drove this race with [[Steven Richards]], [[Cameron McConville]] and [[Nathan Pretty]] while driving for V8 Supercar team boss [[Garry Rogers Motorsport]]. Tander was widely tipped to drive the Monaro for GRM in the [[Australian Nations Cup Championship]] in 2003 but concentrated instead on V8 Supercars with the drive going to Nathan Pretty. In the [[2003 Bathurst 24 Hour]] Tander, again driving the very same Monaro from 2002 with the same co-drivers in the same team, came second to the team's second Monaro driven by [[Peter Brock]], [[Greg Murphy]], [[Jason Bright]] and [[Todd Kelly]]. Driving at the end, Tander finished only 0.2 seconds behind Greg Murphy with Tander setting the race's fastest lap on lap 526, the second last of the race. The GRM Monaro's led the race throughout and finished 13 laps ahead of the third place [[Porsche 911 GT3]] RC.\n\nIn 2004 Tander remained at Garry Rogers Motorsport but it was announced in the early part of the season that he would not be returning to the team in 2005. His season started poorly at Adelaide with a DNF in Race 1 and he was unable to even start Race 2. The rest of the year improved slightly for Garth with his stand out results being 4th overall for the Round at Barbagallo and Sandown. He ended the year 11th in the Championship. In November 2004 it was announced that Garth would move to the [[HSV Dealer Team]] on a 3-year deal starting in 2005.\n\n===HSV Dealer Team===\nIn 2005 he moved to a newly renamed team, the [[HSV Dealer Team]] (formerly K-Mart Racing Team) partnered with dual Bathurst winner Rick Kelly.\n\nTander was leading the V8 Supercar championship in [[2006 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2006]] after six rounds, but a disastrous round in Oran Park lost him the championship lead. The endurance races following were no better. Tander participated in a highly controversial driver swap with the [[Holden Racing Team]] which involved [[Todd Kelly]] coming to the HSV Dealer Team. Garth and co-driver [[Mark Skaife]] dominated the entire Sandown round until a broken steering problem destroyed the almost certain victory. At the next round at Bathurst, the car's clutch failed off the line and was hit from the rear by another car before the second turn on lap one. After a crushing end to his Bathurst 1000 campaign, Tander was visibly upset, probably realising that his run at the V8 Supercar title was all but over. The car had been near on fastest in every practice and qualifying session prior to the race on the Sunday.\n\nFor the second year in a row Tander won the Symmons Plains round, winning two of the three races, even with engine troubles resulting in the car running on seven cylinders. During race one, someone rear-ended him from first to finish fourth with a few laps to go.\n\nTander raced the #16 Toll HSV Commodore in [[2007 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2007]], and won the second round (held at [[Barbagallo Raceway]] in his home state of Western Australia), winning all three 50-lap races. He also repeated this at Queensland Raceway. This saw him take the points lead from his team mate [[Rick Kelly]]. Late in the season, Tander had a disappointment at [[2007 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] where brake issues forced his retirement, but at [[2007 V8 Supercar Challenge|Surfers Paradise]] and [[2007 Desert 400|Bahrain]] he scored solid points to take the lead in the championship back off [[Jamie Whincup]]. At the penultimate [[2007 Falken Tasmania Challenge|Symmons Plains round]] in Tasmania, Tander won the first race, before a slow pitstop in the second race dropped him to tenth. A clash with [[Steven Richards]] over second position broke his steering column, ending the third race prematurely.\n\nTander claimed the 2007 V8 Supercars Championship, just two points ahead of [[Jamie Whincup]] with [[Craig Lowndes]] in third, and defending champ [[Rick Kelly]] in fourth. All four were in contention for the title in the Grand Finale. His round win at Philip Island also saw Holden secure the manufacturers title, and Toll HSV Dealer Team took the teams championship.\n\n===Holden Racing Team===\nIn 2008 Tander moved to [[Holden Racing Team]] after three years at the [[HSV Dealer Team]]. Tander had a bad start to the season with a DNF in both races at the Clipsal 500, His first round win of 2008 came in New Zealand at the Hamilton 400, his second round win came at Winton in July, Tander and his team mate Mark Skaife won the first enduro at the L & H 500 at Philip Island and Tander was looking strong at the Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 but a slipping clutch spoilt a pole position start. 100 laps later his co-driver Mark Skaife crashed lightly into the wall coming up to Forrests Elbow, ending their chances of a win.\n\nTander came third in the 2008 V8 Supercars Championship season behind Mark Winterbottom and series champion [[Jamie Whincup]]. Tander won the Bathurst 1000 twice in [[2009 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000|2009]] with [[Will Davison]] and in [[2011 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000|2011]] with [[Nick Percat]].\n\nIn 2013, with the introduction of the Car Of The Future, [[Holden Racing Team]] (along with all other teams competing with Holdens) changed over to the newer [[Holden VF Commodore|VF Commodore]]. This season gave Tander limited and inconsistent success. He managed to clock up 5 podium finishes, including a win at both Townsville and Phillip Island. He finished the 2013 Championship in 8th place. In 2015, Tander won the [[Enduro Cup]] driving with [[Warren Luff]], despite not winning any of the endurance races.\n\nIn 2016, Tander has slammed Jamie Whincup\u2019s \u201cpretty desperate\u201d move that triggered a disastrous chain-reaction, sending the Holden Racing Team driver crashing into the wall and ending his [[2016 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000|2016]] hopes. Whincup was hit with a 15-second penalty for the driving infringement, while Volvo driver [[Scott McLaughlin (racing driver)|Scott McLaughlin]] was to face post-race investigation for dangerous re-entry. Tander, who was fourth and in pursuit of his second enduro win after his stunning victory at Sandown, said immediately after the incident he blamed Whincup for starting the chain reaction.\n\n===Triple Eight Race Engineering===\nGarth rejoined GRM at the start of the 2017 season.

Supercars.<ref name=\"Tander history\"/>\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n===Garry Rogers Motorsport===\nTander finished second in the [[2000 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2000 championship]] taking the championship to the last round where he was beaten by now five time championship winner [[Mark Skaife]]. After winning the famous [[2000 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] race in 2000 with [[Jason Bargwanna]], he found limited success.\n\nTander was the winner of the first [[2002 Bathurst 24 Hour|Bathurst 24hr]] race driving a modified [[Holden Monaro 427C]] running a 7.0L (427cui) motor rather than the 5.7L Gen III that the road car runs. He co-drove this race with [[Steven Richards]], [[Cameron McConville]] and [[Nathan Pretty]] while driving for V8 Supercar team boss [[Garry Rogers Motorsport]]. Tander was widely tipped to drive the Monaro for GRM in the [[Australian Nations Cup Championship]] in 2003 but concentrated instead on V8 Supercars with the drive going to Nathan Pretty. In the [[2003 Bathurst 24 Hour]] Tander, again driving the very same Monaro from 2002 with the same co-drivers in the same team, came second to the team's second Monaro driven by [[Peter Brock]], [[Greg Murphy]], [[Jason Bright]] and [[Todd Kelly]]. Driving at the end, Tander finished only 0.2 seconds behind Greg Murphy with Tander setting the race's fastest lap on lap 526, the second last of the race. The GRM Monaro's led the race throughout and finished 13 laps ahead of the third place [[Porsche 911 GT3]] RC.\n\nIn 2004 Tander remained at Garry Rogers Motorsport but it was announced in the early part of the season that he would not be returning to the team in 2005. His season started poorly at Adelaide with a DNF in Race 1 and he was unable to even start Race 2. The rest of the year improved slightly for Garth with his stand out results being 4th overall for the Round at Barbagallo and Sandown. He ended the year 11th in the Championship. In November 2004 it was announced that Garth would move to the [[HSV Dealer Team]] on a 3-year deal starting in 2005.\n\n===HSV Dealer Team===\nIn 2005 he moved to a newly renamed team, the [[HSV Dealer Team]] (formerly K-Mart Racing Team) partnered with dual Bathurst winner Rick Kelly.\n\nTander was leading the V8 Supercar championship in [[2006 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2006]] after six rounds, but a disastrous round in Oran Park lost him the championship lead. The endurance races following were no better. Tander participated in a highly controversial driver swap with the [[Holden Racing Team]] which involved [[Todd Kelly]] coming to the HSV Dealer Team. Garth and co-driver [[Mark Skaife]] dominated the entire Sandown round until a broken steering problem destroyed the almost certain victory. At the next round at Bathurst, the car's clutch failed off the line and was hit from the rear by another car before the second turn on lap one. After a crushing end to his Bathurst 1000 campaign, Tander was visibly upset, probably realising that his run at the V8 Supercar title was all but over. The car had been near on fastest in every practice and qualifying session prior to the race on the Sunday.\n\nFor the second year in a row Tander won the Symmons Plains round, winning two of the three races, even with engine troubles resulting in the car running on seven cylinders. During race one, someone rear-ended him from first to finish fourth with a few laps to go.\n\nTander raced the #16 Toll HSV Commodore in [[2007 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2007]], and won the second round (held at [[Barbagallo Raceway]] in his home state of Western Australia), winning all three 50-lap races. He also repeated this at Queensland Raceway. This saw him take the points lead from his team mate [[Rick Kelly]]. Late in the season, Tander had a disappointment at [[2007 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] where brake issues forced his retirement, but at [[2007 V8 Supercar Challenge|Surfers Paradise]] and [[2007 Desert 400|Bahrain]] he scored solid points to take the lead in the championship back off [[Jamie Whincup]]. At the penultimate [[2007 Falken Tasmania Challenge|Symmons Plains round]] in Tasmania, Tander won the first race, before a slow pitstop in the second race dropped him to tenth. A clash with [[Steven Richards]] over second position broke his steering column, ending the third race prematurely.\n\nTander claimed the 2007 V8 Supercars Championship, just two points ahead of [[Jamie Whincup]] with [[Craig Lowndes]] in third, and defending champ [[Rick Kelly]] in fourth. All four were in contention for the title in the Grand Finale. His round win at Philip Island also saw Holden secure the manufacturers title, and Toll HSV Dealer Team took the teams championship.\n\n===Holden Racing Team===\nIn 2008 Tander moved to [[Holden Racing Team]] after three years at the [[HSV Dealer Team]]. Tander had a bad start to the season with a DNF in both races at the Clipsal 500, His first round win of 2008 came in New Zealand at the Hamilton 400, his second round win came at Winton in July, Tander and his team mate Mark Skaife won the first enduro at the L & H 500 at Philip Island and Tander was looking strong at the Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 but a slipping clutch spoilt a pole position start. 100 laps later his co-driver Mark Skaife crashed lightly into the wall coming up to Forrests Elbow, ending their chances of a win.\n\nTander came third in the 2008 V8 Supercars Championship season behind Mark Winterbottom and series champion [[Jamie Whincup]]. Tander won the Bathurst 1000 twice in [[2009 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000|2009]] with [[Will Davison]] and in [[2011 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000|2011]] with [[Nick Percat]].\n\nIn 2013, with the introduction of the Car Of The Future, [[Holden Racing Team]] (along with all other teams competing with Holdens) changed over to the newer [[Holden VF Commodore|VF Commodore]]. This season gave Tander limited and inconsistent success. He managed to clock up 5 podium finishes, including a win at both Townsville and Phillip Island. He finished the 2013 Championship in 8th place. In 2015, Tander won the [[Enduro Cup]] driving with [[Warren Luff]], despite not winning any of the endurance races.\n\nIn 2016, Tander has slammed Jamie Whincup\u2019s \u201cpretty desperate\u201d move that triggered a disastrous chain-reaction, sending the Holden Racing Team driver crashing into the wall and ending his [[2016 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000|2016]] hopes. Whincup was hit with a 15-second penalty for the driving infringement, while Volvo driver [[Scott McLaughlin (racing driver)|Scott McLaughlin]] was to face post-race investigation for dangerous re-entry. Tander, who was fourth and in pursuit of his second enduro win after his stunning victory at Sandown, said immediately after the incident he blamed Whincup for starting the chain reaction.\n\n===Triple Eight Race Engineering===\nGarth rejoined GRM at the start of the 2017 season. He spent two years with GRM but was unexpectedly dumped by the team just before the start of the 2019 season.<ref>https://www.examiner.com.au/story/5846090/grm-sidelines-tander/</ref>. Without a full time drive he was signed by [[Triple Eight Race Engineering]] to be a co-driver for the endurance races.<ref>https://www.westernadvocate.com.au/story/5843948/tanders-got-new-seat-at-bathurst-alongside-van-gisbergen/</ref>\n\n==Career results==\n[[File:Holden VE Commodore of Garth Tander 2011.jpg|thumb|The [[Holden VE Commodore]] of Garth Tander at the [[2011 Clipsal 500 Adelaide]]]] \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!
