Kilmarnock initially defeated [[Hurlford F.C.|Hurlford]] 6\u20131 at Drumbiehill Park but a protest over a breach of registration rules was upheld and the result was declared void. The match was replayed and this time Hurlford won 3\u20131, however a similar protest by Kilmarnock was also upheld and Hurlford were disqualified from the competition. In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals. On 31 January 1885, Kilmarnock thumped [[Ayr F.C.|Ayr]] 5\u20132 at [[Rugby Park]] to reach the final for the second consecutive season. They retained the cup after defeating Hurlford 2\u20130 in the final at Holm Quarry.\n\nThe two charity cups saw similar fates for Kilmarnock.

Hurlford won through with a 5\u20131 victory in the fifth match on 14 November 1885.\n\nA third successive Ayrshire Cup triumph began with an 8\u20131 win over [[Maybole F.C.

In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals.

Her novels are known for their wit and intelligence, and one in particular is scathingly autobiographical in describing her unhappy childhood.\n\nShe was born into an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family from [[Ulster]] at 4 Hans Crescent in [[Knightsbridge]], her parents' London home. She was, she admitted, \"scantily educated\" at, among other schools, [[Rockport School]] ([[County Down]]) and [[Downham, Essex|Downham]] ([[Essex]]). After a [[finishing school]] in [[Oxford]] she was presented as a [[debutante]] in 1949 at a ball held at [[Londonderry House]].\n\n==Career==\nBlackwood's first job was with [[Hulton Press]] as a secretary, but she was soon given small reporting jobs by [[Claud Cockburn]]. [[Ann Fleming]], the wife of \"[[James Bond]]\" author [[Ian Fleming]], introduced Lady Caroline to [[Lucian Freud]], and the two eloped to Paris in 1952. In Paris she met [[Picasso]] (and reportedly refused to wash for three days after he drew on her hands and nails). She married Freud on 9 December 1953 and became a striking figure in London's bohemian circles; the [[Gargoyle Club]] and [[Colony Room]] replaced [[Belgravia]] [[drawing room]]s as her haunts. She sat for several of Freud's finest portraits, including ''Girl in Bed'', which testifies to her alluring beauty. She was impressed by the ruthless vision of Freud and [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] and her later fiction was a literary version of their view of humanity.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Blackwood began contributing to ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'', ''[[The London Magazine#1954.E2.80.93present|London Magazine]]'', and other periodicals on subjects such as [[beatniks]], [[the Troubles|Ulster sectarianism]], [[political_theatre#feminist_theatre|feminist theatre]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Free school movement|free schools]]. Although these articles were elegant, minutely observed and sometimes wickedly funny, they had, according to [[Christopher Isherwood]], a persistent flaw: \"she is only capable of thinking negatively. Confronted by a phenomenon, she asks herself: what is wrong with it?\"<ref>Schoenberger, Nancy (2012).

''New York'' magazine, 19 September 2010.</ref>\n\nHer third husband, [[Robert Lowell]], was a crucial influence on her talents as a novelist. He encouraged her to write her first book, ''For All That I Found There'' (1973), the title of which is a line from the [[Percy French]] song \"The Mountains of Mourne\", and which includes a mordant memoir of her daughter's treatment in a burns unit. Blackwood's first novel ''The Stepdaughter'' (1976) appeared three years later to much acclaim, and is a concise and gripping monologue by a rich, self-pitying woman deserted by her husband in a plush New York apartment and tormented by her fat stepdaughter. It won the [[David Higham Prize]] for best first novel. ''Great Granny Webster''  followed in 1977 and was partly derived on her own miserable childhood, and depicted an austere and loveless old woman's destructive impact on her daughter and granddaughter.

Her novels are known for their wit and intelligence, and one in particular is scathingly autobiographical in describing her unhappy childhood.\n\nShe was born into an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family from [[Ulster]] at 4 Hans Crescent in [[Knightsbridge]], her parents' London home. She was, she admitted, \"scantily educated\" at, among other schools, [[Rockport School]] ([[County Down]]) and [[Downham, Essex|Downham]] ([[Essex]]). After a [[finishing school]] in [[Oxford]] she was presented as a [[debutante]] in 1949 at a ball held at [[Londonderry House]].\n\n==Career==\nBlackwood's first job was with [[Hulton Press]] as a secretary, but she was soon given small reporting jobs by [[Claud Cockburn]]. [[Ann Fleming]], the wife of \"[[James Bond]]\" author [[Ian Fleming]], introduced Lady Caroline to [[Lucian Freud]], and the two eloped to Paris in 1952. In Paris she met [[Picasso]] (and reportedly refused to wash for three days after he drew on her hands and nails). She married Freud on 9 December 1953 and became a striking figure in London's bohemian circles; the [[Gargoyle Club]] and [[Colony Room]] replaced [[Belgravia]] [[drawing room]]s as her haunts. She sat for several of Freud's finest portraits, including ''Girl in Bed'', which testifies to her alluring beauty. She was impressed by the ruthless vision of Freud and [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] and her later fiction was a literary version of their view of humanity.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Blackwood began contributing to ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'', ''[[The London Magazine#1954.E2.80.93present|London Magazine]]'', and other periodicals on subjects such as [[beatniks]], [[the Troubles|Ulster sectarianism]], [[political_theatre#feminist_theatre|feminist theatre]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Free school movement|free schools]]. Although these articles were elegant, minutely observed and sometimes wickedly funny, they had, according to [[Christopher Isherwood]], a persistent flaw: \"she is only capable of thinking negatively. Confronted by a phenomenon, she asks herself: what is wrong with it?\"<ref>Schoenberger, Nancy (2012).

He encouraged her to write her first book, ''For All That I Found There'' (1973), the title of which is a line from the [[Percy French]] song \"The Mountains of Mourne\", and which includes a mordant memoir of her daughter's treatment in a burns unit. Blackwood's first novel ''The Stepdaughter'' (1976) appeared three years later to much acclaim, and is a concise and gripping monologue by a rich, self-pitying woman deserted by her husband in a plush New York apartment and tormented by her fat stepdaughter. It won the [[David Higham Prize]] for best first novel. ''Great Granny Webster''  followed in 1977 and was partly derived on her own miserable childhood, and depicted an austere and loveless old woman's destructive impact on her daughter and granddaughter.

She warns Asriel, then spies on his lecture about [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]], mysterious [[elementary particle]]s. Lyra's friend Roger is kidnapped by child abductors known as the \"Gobblers.\" Lyra is adopted by a charming socialite, [[Marisa Coulter|Mrs Coulter]]. The Master secretly entrusts her with an alethiometer, a truth-telling device. Lyra discovers that Mrs Coulter is the leader of the Gobblers, and that it is a project secretly funded by the Church. Lyra flees to the [[Gyptians]], [[canal]]-faring [[Nomadic|nomads]], whose children have also been abducted. They reveal to Lyra that Asriel and Mrs Coulter are actually her parents.\n\nThe Gyptians form an expedition to the Arctic with Lyra to rescue the children. Lyra recruits [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Iorek Byrnison|Iorek Byrnison]], an [[Panserbj\u00f8rne|armoured bear]], and his human [[aeronaut]] friend, [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Lee Scoresby|Lee Scoresby]]. She also learns that Lord Asriel has been exiled, guarded by the bears on [[Svalbard]].\n\nNear Bolvangar, the Gobbler research station, Lyra finds an abandoned child who has been cut from his d\u00e6mon; the Gobblers are experimenting on children by severing the bond between human and d\u00e6mon, a procedure called \u201cintercision.\u201d\n\nLyra is captured and taken to Bolvangar, where she is reunited with Roger. Mrs Coulter tells Lyra that the intercision prevents the onset of troubling adult emotions. Lyra and the children are rescued by Scoresby, Iorek, the Gyptians, and [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Serafina Pekkala|Serafina Pekkala]]'s flying witch clan. Lyra falls out of Scoresby's balloon and is taken by the panserbj\u00f8rne to the castle of their usurping king, [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Iofur Raknison|Iofur Raknison]]. She tricks Iofur into fighting Iorek, who arrives with the others to rescue Lyra. Iorek kills Iofur and takes his place as the rightful king.\n\nLyra, Iorek, and Roger travel to Svalbard, where Asriel has continued his Dust research in exile. He tells Lyra that the Church believes Dust is the basis of [[Original sin|sin]], and plans to visit the other universes and destroy its source. He severs Roger from his d\u00e6mon, killing him and releasing enough energy to create an opening to a parallel universe. Lyra determines to stop Asriel and discover the source of Dust for herself.\n\n===''The Subtle Knife''===\n{{Main|The Subtle Knife}}\n\nLyra journeys through Asriel's opening between worlds to [[Citt\u00e0gazze]], a city whose denizens have discovered a clean path between worlds at a far earlier point in time than others in the storyline. Citt\u00e0gazze's reckless use of the technology has released soul-eating [[Spectre (His Dark Materials)|Spectre]]s, to which children are immune, rendering much of the world closed to transit by adults. Here Lyra meets [[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]], a twelve-year-old boy from our world. Will, who recently killed a man to protect his ailing mother, has stumbled into Citt\u00e0gazze in an effort to locate his long-lost father. Venturing into Will's (our) world, Lyra meets Dr. Mary Malone, a physicist who is researching what she calls Shadow Particles, which are the same as Dust in Lyra's world. Lyra encourages Dr. Malone to attempt to communicate with the particles, and when she does they tell her to travel into the Citt\u00e0gazze world.\n\nWill becomes the bearer of the eponymous Subtle Knife, a tool forged 300 years ago by Citt\u00e0gazze's scientists from the same materials used to make [[Bolvangar]]'s silver guillotine. One edge of the knife can divide  [[subatomic particles]] and form subtle divisions in space, creating portals between worlds; the other edge easily cuts through any form of matter. After meeting with witches from Lyra's world, they continue their journey.\n\nMeanwhile, in Lyra's world, Lee Scoresby seeks out Stanislaus Grumman. When Scoresby finds him, Grumman insists on being taken through the opening into the Citt\u00e0gazze world in Scoresby's balloon. Scoresby dies defending Grumman from the forces of the Church. Grumman turns out to be Will's long-lost father and succeeds in reuniting with his son before he is murdered by a witch who loved him but whom he rejected. After his father's death, Will discovers that Lyra has been kidnapped and he is approached by two angels requesting his aid.\n\n===''The Amber Spyglass''===\n{{Main|The Amber Spyglass}}\n\n''The Amber Spyglass'' tells of Lyra's kidnapping by her mother, [[Marisa Coulter|Mrs Coulter]], an agent of the Magisterium who has learned of the prophecy identifying Lyra as the next [[Adam and Eve|Eve]]. A pair of angels, Balthamos and Baruch, tell Will that he must travel with them to give the Subtle Knife to Lyra's father, [[Lord Asriel]], as a weapon against [[Authority (His Dark Materials)|The Authority]]. Will ignores the angels; with the help of a local girl named Ama, the [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Iorek Byrnison|Bear King Iorek Byrnison]], and [[Lord Asriel]]'s [[Gallivespian]] spies, the [[Chevalier Tialys]] and the [[Lady Salmakia]], he rescues Lyra from the cave where her mother has hidden her from the Magisterium, which has become determined to kill her before she yields to temptation and sin like the original Eve.\n\nWill, Lyra, Tialys and Salmakia journey to the Land of the Dead, temporarily parting with their [[d\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mons]] to release the ghosts from their captivity. [[Mary Malone]], a scientist from Will's world interested in \"shadows\" (or [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]] in Lyra's world), travels to a land populated by strange sentient creatures called [[Mulefa]]. There she comes to understand the true nature of Dust, which is both created by and nourishes life which has become self-aware. [[Lord Asriel]] and the reformed [[Mrs Coulter]] work to destroy the Authority's [[Regent]] [[Metatron]]. They succeed, but themselves suffer annihilation in the process by pulling Metatron into the abyss.\n\nThe Authority himself dies of his own frailty when Will and Lyra free him from the crystal prison wherein Metatron had trapped him, able to do so because an attack by [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Cliff-ghasts and night-ghasts|cliff-ghasts]] kills or drives away the prison's protectors. When Will and Lyra emerge from the land of the dead, they find their d\u00e6mons.\n\nThe book ends with Will and Lyra falling in love but realising they cannot live together in the same world, because all windows \u2014 except one from the underworld to the world of the Mulefa \u2014 must be closed to prevent the loss of Dust, because with every window opening, a Spectre would be created and that means Will must never use the knife again. They must also be apart because both of them can only live full lives in their native worlds. During the return, Mary Malone learns how to see her own d\u00e6mon, who takes the form of a black [[Alpine chough]]. Lyra loses her ability to intuitively read the alethiometer and determines to learn how to use her conscious mind to achieve the same effect.\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Please remember that character information duplicates 1. on main HDM page  2.

Entries in this list should be VERY BRIEF, with fuller exposition elsewhere. -->\n{{main|List of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust characters}}\n\nAll humans in Lyra's world, including witches, have a [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]]. It is the physical manifestation of a person's 'inner being', soul or spirit. It takes the form of a creature (moth, bird, dog, monkey, snake, etc.) and is usually the opposite sex to its human counterpart. The d\u00e6mons of children have the ability to change form - from one creature to another - but towards the end of a child's puberty, their d\u00e6mon \"settles\" into a permanent form, which reflects the person's personality. When a person dies, the d\u00e6mon dies too. Armoured bears, cliff ghasts and other creatures do not have d\u00e6mons. An armoured bear's armour is his soul.\n\n*[[Lyra Belacqua]], a wild 12-year-old girl, has grown up in the fictional [[Jordan College, Oxford]]. She is skinny with dark blonde hair and blue eyes. She prides herself on her capacity for mischief, especially her ability to lie, earning her the [[epithet]] \"Silvertongue\" from Iorek Byrnison. Lyra has a natural ability to use the alethiometer, which is capable of answering any question when properly manipulated and read.\n*[[Lyra Belacqua#Pantalaimon|Pantalaimon]] is Lyra's [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]]. Like all d\u00e6mons of children, he changes from one creature to another constantly. When Lyra reaches puberty, he assumes the permanent form of a [[European pine marten|pine marten]]. Pantalaimon and Lyra follow her father, Lord Asriel, when he travels to the newly discovered world of Cittagazze, where Lyra meets Will.\n*[[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]], a sensible, morally conscious, assertive 12-year-old boy from our world. He becomes the bearer of the subtle knife. Will is independent and responsible for his age, having looked after his mentally ill mother for several years.\n*[[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)#D\u00e6mon|Kirjava]] is Will's d\u00e6mon (named by Serafina Pekkala). She does not settle before the end of the story; but it is hinted that she will take the form of a cat.\n*The [[Authority (His Dark Materials)|Authority]] is the first angel to have emerged from Dust. He controls the Church, an oppressive religious institution. He told the later-arriving angels that he created them and the universe, but this is a lie. Although he is one of the two primary adversaries in the trilogy \u2014 Lord Asriel is his primary opponent \u2014 he remains in the background; he makes his only appearance late in ''The Amber Spyglass.'' The Authority has grown weak and transferred most of his powers to his regent, [[Metatron]]. He is extremely aged, fragile and naive.\n*[[Lord Asriel]], ostensibly Lyra's uncle, is later revealed to be her father. He opens a rift between the worlds in his pursuit of Dust. His dream of establishing a Republic of Heaven to rival the Authority's Kingdom leads him to use his power to raise a grand army from across the multiverse to rise up in rebellion against the forces of the Church.\n*[[Marisa Coulter]] is the coldly beautiful, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] mother of Lyra and former lover of Lord Asriel. She serves the Church by kidnapping children for research into the nature of Dust, in the course of which she separates them from their d\u00e6mons - a procedure known as intercision. She has black hair, a slim build, and looks younger than she is. Initially hostile to Lyra, she realises that she loves her daughter and seeks to protect her from agents of the Church, who want to kill Lyra. Her d\u00e6mon is a golden monkey with a cruel streak.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Metatron|Metatron]], Asriel's principal adversary, was a human, [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], in biblical times, but was later transfigured into an [[angel]]. The Authority has displayed his declining health by appointing Metatron his Regent. As Regent, Metatron has implanted the monotheistic religions across the universes. He becomes vulnerable to the seductive advances of Marisa Coulter, who betrays him by luring him into the underworld to his death. He is the series' main antagonist.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lord Boreal|Lord Carlo Boreal]], or Sir Charles Latrom, CBE as he is known as in [[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]]'s world, serves as a minor character in ''Northern Lights'', but is a main antagonist in ''[[The Subtle Knife]]''. He is an old Englishman, appearing to be in his sixties. He normally wears pale suits and is described as smelling sweetly. He is ultimately poisoned by Mrs Coulter, to whom he has previously been a lover.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Dr. Mary Malone|Mary Malone]], is a [[physicist]] and former [[nun]] from Will's world. She meets Lyra during Lyra's first visit to Will's world. Lyra provides Mary with insight into the nature of [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]]. Agents of the Church force Mary to flee to the world of the [[mulefa]]. There she constructs the amber spyglass, which enables her to see the otherwise invisible Dust. Her purpose is to learn why Dust, which mulefa civilization depends on, is flowing out of the universe. Mary relates a story of a lost love to Will and Lyra, and later packs for them a lunch containing \"little red fruits\", which her computer, \"the Cave,\" had instructed her to do.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Iorek Byrnison|Iorek Byrnison]] is a massive armoured bear. An armoured bear's armour is his soul. Iorek's armour is stolen, so he becomes despondent. With Lyra's help he regains his armour, his dignity, and his kingship over the armoured bears. In gratitude, and impressed by her cunning, he dubs her \"Lyra Silvertongue\". A powerful warrior and [[armour]]smith, Iorek repairs the Subtle Knife when it shatters. He later goes to war against The Authority and Metatron.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lee Scoresby|Lee Scoresby]], a rangy [[Texas|Texan]], is a balloonist. He helps Lyra in an early quest to reach Asriel's residence in the North, and he later helps John Parry reunite with his son Will.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Serafina Pekkala|Serafina Pekkala]] is the beautiful queen of a clan of Northern [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Witches|witches]]. Her [[snow goose|snow-goose]] [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]] Kaisa, like all witches' d\u00e6mons, can travel much farther apart from her than the d\u00e6mons of humans, without feeling the pain of separation.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#The Master of Jordan College|The Master of Jordan]] heads Jordan College, part of Oxford University in Lyra's world. Helped by other Jordan College employees, he is raising the supposedly orphaned Lyra. Faced with difficult choices that only later become apparent, he tries unsuccessfully to poison Lord Asriel.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Roger Parslow|Roger Parslow]] is the kitchen boy at Jordan College and Lyra's best friend.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#John Parry|John Parry]] is Will's father. He is an explorer from our world who discovered a portal to Lyra's world and became the shaman known as Stanislaus Grumman or Jopari, a corruption of his original name.\n*The [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Gallivespians|Four Gallivespians]]: Lord Roke, Madame Oxentiel, Chevalier Tialys and Lady Salmakia \u2014 are tiny people (a hand-span tall) with poisonous heel spurs.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Ma Costa|Ma Costa]]: A Gyptian woman whose son, Billy Costa is abducted by the \"Gobblers\". She rescues Lyra from Mrs Coulter and takes her to John Faa. We later discover that Ma Costa nursed Lyra, when she was a baby.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#John Faa|John Faa]]: The King of all the [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Gyptians|Gyptians]]. He journeys with Lyra to the North with his companion [[Farder Coram]]. Faa and Costa rescue Lyra when she runs away from Mrs Coulter. Then they take her to Iorek Byrnison.\n*Father Gomez is a priest sent by the Church to assassinate Lyra. The angel [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Balthamos|Balthamos]] kills Gomez before he can reach her.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Fra Pavel|Fra Pavel Ra\u0161ek]] is a representative and alethiometrist of the Consistorial Court of Discipline. He is said to be a sluggish reader of the device, his [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]] is a [[frog]].\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Balthamos|Balthamos]] is a rebel angel who, with his lover Baruch, join in Will's journey to find the captured Lyra. Near the end of the story, he saves both Lyra's and Will's lives by killing Father Gomez. Upon ensuring their safety, Balthamos calls out Baruch's name and dies.\n*Tony Makarios is a naive boy who is lured into captivity by Mrs Coulter.\n*[[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]] are four-legged wheeled animals; they have one leg in front, one in back, and one on each side. The \"wheels\" are huge, round, hard seed-pods from seed-pod trees; an axle-like claw at the end of each leg grips a seed-pod.

She also learns that Lord Asriel has been exiled, guarded by the bears on [[Svalbard]].\n\nNear Bolvangar, the Gobbler research station, Lyra finds an abandoned child who has been cut from his d\u00e6mon; the Gobblers are experimenting on children by severing the bond between human and d\u00e6mon, a procedure called \u201cintercision.\u201d\n\nLyra is captured and taken to Bolvangar, where she is reunited with Roger. Mrs Coulter tells Lyra that the intercision prevents the onset of troubling adult emotions. Lyra and the children are rescued by Scoresby, Iorek, the Gyptians, and [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Serafina Pekkala|Serafina Pekkala]]'s flying witch clan. Lyra falls out of Scoresby's balloon and is taken by the panserbj\u00f8rne to the castle of their usurping king, [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Iofur Raknison|Iofur Raknison]]. She tricks Iofur into fighting Iorek, who arrives with the others to rescue Lyra. Iorek kills Iofur and takes his place as the rightful king.\n\nLyra, Iorek, and Roger travel to Svalbard, where Asriel has continued his Dust research in exile. He tells Lyra that the Church believes Dust is the basis of [[Original sin|sin]], and plans to visit the other universes and destroy its source. He severs Roger from his d\u00e6mon, killing him and releasing enough energy to create an opening to a parallel universe. Lyra determines to stop Asriel and discover the source of Dust for herself.\n\n===''The Subtle Knife''===\n{{Main|The Subtle Knife}}\n\nLyra journeys through Asriel's opening between worlds to [[Citt\u00e0gazze]], a city whose denizens have discovered a clean path between worlds at a far earlier point in time than others in the storyline. Citt\u00e0gazze's reckless use of the technology has released soul-eating [[Spectre (His Dark Materials)|Spectre]]s, to which children are immune, rendering much of the world closed to transit by adults. Here Lyra meets [[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]], a twelve-year-old boy from our world. Will, who recently killed a man to protect his ailing mother, has stumbled into Citt\u00e0gazze in an effort to locate his long-lost father. Venturing into Will's (our) world, Lyra meets Dr. Mary Malone, a physicist who is researching what she calls Shadow Particles, which are the same as Dust in Lyra's world. Lyra encourages Dr. Malone to attempt to communicate with the particles, and when she does they tell her to travel into the Citt\u00e0gazze world.\n\nWill becomes the bearer of the eponymous Subtle Knife, a tool forged 300 years ago by Citt\u00e0gazze's scientists from the same materials used to make [[Bolvangar]]'s silver guillotine. One edge of the knife can divide  [[subatomic particles]] and form subtle divisions in space, creating portals between worlds; the other edge easily cuts through any form of matter. After meeting with witches from Lyra's world, they continue their journey.\n\nMeanwhile, in Lyra's world, Lee Scoresby seeks out Stanislaus Grumman. When Scoresby finds him, Grumman insists on being taken through the opening into the Citt\u00e0gazze world in Scoresby's balloon. Scoresby dies defending Grumman from the forces of the Church. Grumman turns out to be Will's long-lost father and succeeds in reuniting with his son before he is murdered by a witch who loved him but whom he rejected. After his father's death, Will discovers that Lyra has been kidnapped and he is approached by two angels requesting his aid.\n\n===''The Amber Spyglass''===\n{{Main|The Amber Spyglass}}\n\n''The Amber Spyglass'' tells of Lyra's kidnapping by her mother, [[Marisa Coulter|Mrs Coulter]], an agent of the Magisterium who has learned of the prophecy identifying Lyra as the next [[Adam and Eve|Eve]]. A pair of angels, Balthamos and Baruch, tell Will that he must travel with them to give the Subtle Knife to Lyra's father, [[Lord Asriel]], as a weapon against [[Authority (His Dark Materials)|The Authority]]. Will ignores the angels; with the help of a local girl named Ama, the [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Iorek Byrnison|Bear King Iorek Byrnison]], and [[Lord Asriel]]'s [[Gallivespian]] spies, the [[Chevalier Tialys]] and the [[Lady Salmakia]], he rescues Lyra from the cave where her mother has hidden her from the Magisterium, which has become determined to kill her before she yields to temptation and sin like the original Eve.\n\nWill, Lyra, Tialys and Salmakia journey to the Land of the Dead, temporarily parting with their [[d\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mons]] to release the ghosts from their captivity. [[Mary Malone]], a scientist from Will's world interested in \"shadows\" (or [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]] in Lyra's world), travels to a land populated by strange sentient creatures called [[Mulefa]]. There she comes to understand the true nature of Dust, which is both created by and nourishes life which has become self-aware. [[Lord Asriel]] and the reformed [[Mrs Coulter]] work to destroy the Authority's [[Regent]] [[Metatron]]. They succeed, but themselves suffer annihilation in the process by pulling Metatron into the abyss.\n\nThe Authority himself dies of his own frailty when Will and Lyra free him from the crystal prison wherein Metatron had trapped him, able to do so because an attack by [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Cliff-ghasts and night-ghasts|cliff-ghasts]] kills or drives away the prison's protectors. When Will and Lyra emerge from the land of the dead, they find their d\u00e6mons.\n\nThe book ends with Will and Lyra falling in love but realising they cannot live together in the same world, because all windows \u2014 except one from the underworld to the world of the Mulefa \u2014 must be closed to prevent the loss of Dust, because with every window opening, a Spectre would be created and that means Will must never use the knife again. They must also be apart because both of them can only live full lives in their native worlds. During the return, Mary Malone learns how to see her own d\u00e6mon, who takes the form of a black [[Alpine chough]]. Lyra loses her ability to intuitively read the alethiometer and determines to learn how to use her conscious mind to achieve the same effect.\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Please remember that character information duplicates 1. on main HDM page  2. On character list page 3. On individual character pages and 4. Northern Lights page. Entries in this list should be VERY BRIEF, with fuller exposition elsewhere. -->\n{{main|List of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust characters}}\n\nAll humans in Lyra's world, including witches, have a [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]]. It is the physical manifestation of a person's 'inner being', soul or spirit. It takes the form of a creature (moth, bird, dog, monkey, snake, etc.) and is usually the opposite sex to its human counterpart. The d\u00e6mons of children have the ability to change form - from one creature to another - but towards the end of a child's puberty, their d\u00e6mon \"settles\" into a permanent form, which reflects the person's personality. When a person dies, the d\u00e6mon dies too. Armoured bears, cliff ghasts and other creatures do not have d\u00e6mons. An armoured bear's armour is his soul.\n\n*[[Lyra Belacqua]], a wild 12-year-old girl, has grown up in the fictional [[Jordan College, Oxford]]. She is skinny with dark blonde hair and blue eyes. She prides herself on her capacity for mischief, especially her ability to lie, earning her the [[epithet]] \"Silvertongue\" from Iorek Byrnison. Lyra has a natural ability to use the alethiometer, which is capable of answering any question when properly manipulated and read.\n*[[Lyra Belacqua#Pantalaimon|Pantalaimon]] is Lyra's [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]]. Like all d\u00e6mons of children, he changes from one creature to another constantly. When Lyra reaches puberty, he assumes the permanent form of a [[European pine marten|pine marten]]. Pantalaimon and Lyra follow her father, Lord Asriel, when he travels to the newly discovered world of Cittagazze, where Lyra meets Will.\n*[[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]], a sensible, morally conscious, assertive 12-year-old boy from our world. He becomes the bearer of the subtle knife. Will is independent and responsible for his age, having looked after his mentally ill mother for several years.\n*[[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)#D\u00e6mon|Kirjava]] is Will's d\u00e6mon (named by Serafina Pekkala). She does not settle before the end of the story; but it is hinted that she will take the form of a cat.\n*The [[Authority (His Dark Materials)|Authority]] is the first angel to have emerged from Dust. He controls the Church, an oppressive religious institution. He told the later-arriving angels that he created them and the universe, but this is a lie. Although he is one of the two primary adversaries in the trilogy \u2014 Lord Asriel is his primary opponent \u2014 he remains in the background; he makes his only appearance late in ''The Amber Spyglass.'' The Authority has grown weak and transferred most of his powers to his regent, [[Metatron]]. He is extremely aged, fragile and naive.\n*[[Lord Asriel]], ostensibly Lyra's uncle, is later revealed to be her father. He opens a rift between the worlds in his pursuit of Dust. His dream of establishing a Republic of Heaven to rival the Authority's Kingdom leads him to use his power to raise a grand army from across the multiverse to rise up in rebellion against the forces of the Church.\n*[[Marisa Coulter]] is the coldly beautiful, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] mother of Lyra and former lover of Lord Asriel. She serves the Church by kidnapping children for research into the nature of Dust, in the course of which she separates them from their d\u00e6mons - a procedure known as intercision. She has black hair, a slim build, and looks younger than she is. Initially hostile to Lyra, she realises that she loves her daughter and seeks to protect her from agents of the Church, who want to kill Lyra. Her d\u00e6mon is a golden monkey with a cruel streak.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Metatron|Metatron]], Asriel's principal adversary, was a human, [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], in biblical times, but was later transfigured into an [[angel]]. The Authority has displayed his declining health by appointing Metatron his Regent. As Regent, Metatron has implanted the monotheistic religions across the universes. He becomes vulnerable to the seductive advances of Marisa Coulter, who betrays him by luring him into the underworld to his death. He is the series' main antagonist.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lord Boreal|Lord Carlo Boreal]], or Sir Charles Latrom, CBE as he is known as in [[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]]'s world, serves as a minor character in ''Northern Lights'', but is a main antagonist in ''[[The Subtle Knife]]''. He is an old Englishman, appearing to be in his sixties. He normally wears pale suits and is described as smelling sweetly. He is ultimately poisoned by Mrs Coulter, to whom he has previously been a lover.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Dr. Mary Malone|Mary Malone]], is a [[physicist]] and former [[nun]] from Will's world. She meets Lyra during Lyra's first visit to Will's world. Lyra provides Mary with insight into the nature of [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]]. Agents of the Church force Mary to flee to the world of the [[mulefa]]. There she constructs the amber spyglass, which enables her to see the otherwise invisible Dust. Her purpose is to learn why Dust, which mulefa civilization depends on, is flowing out of the universe. Mary relates a story of a lost love to Will and Lyra, and later packs for them a lunch containing \"little red fruits\", which her computer, \"the Cave,\" had instructed her to do.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Iorek Byrnison|Iorek Byrnison]] is a massive armoured bear. An armoured bear's armour is his soul. Iorek's armour is stolen, so he becomes despondent. With Lyra's help he regains his armour, his dignity, and his kingship over the armoured bears. In gratitude, and impressed by her cunning, he dubs her \"Lyra Silvertongue\". A powerful warrior and [[armour]]smith, Iorek repairs the Subtle Knife when it shatters. He later goes to war against The Authority and Metatron.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lee Scoresby|Lee Scoresby]], a rangy [[Texas|Texan]], is a balloonist. He helps Lyra in an early quest to reach Asriel's residence in the North, and he later helps John Parry reunite with his son Will.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Serafina Pekkala|Serafina Pekkala]] is the beautiful queen of a clan of Northern [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Witches|witches]]. Her [[snow goose|snow-goose]] [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]] Kaisa, like all witches' d\u00e6mons, can travel much farther apart from her than the d\u00e6mons of humans, without feeling the pain of separation.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#The Master of Jordan College|The Master of Jordan]] heads Jordan College, part of Oxford University in Lyra's world. Helped by other Jordan College employees, he is raising the supposedly orphaned Lyra. Faced with difficult choices that only later become apparent, he tries unsuccessfully to poison Lord Asriel.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Roger Parslow|Roger Parslow]] is the kitchen boy at Jordan College and Lyra's best friend.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#John Parry|John Parry]] is Will's father. He is an explorer from our world who discovered a portal to Lyra's world and became the shaman known as Stanislaus Grumman or Jopari, a corruption of his original name.\n*The [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Gallivespians|Four Gallivespians]]: Lord Roke, Madame Oxentiel, Chevalier Tialys and Lady Salmakia \u2014 are tiny people (a hand-span tall) with poisonous heel spurs.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Ma Costa|Ma Costa]]: A Gyptian woman whose son, Billy Costa is abducted by the \"Gobblers\". She rescues Lyra from Mrs Coulter and takes her to John Faa. We later discover that Ma Costa nursed Lyra, when she was a baby.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#John Faa|John Faa]]: The King of all the [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Gyptians|Gyptians]]. He journeys with Lyra to the North with his companion [[Farder Coram]]. Faa and Costa rescue Lyra when she runs away from Mrs Coulter. Then they take her to Iorek Byrnison.\n*Father Gomez is a priest sent by the Church to assassinate Lyra. The angel [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Balthamos|Balthamos]] kills Gomez before he can reach her.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Fra Pavel|Fra Pavel Ra\u0161ek]] is a representative and alethiometrist of the Consistorial Court of Discipline. He is said to be a sluggish reader of the device, his [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]] is a [[frog]].\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Balthamos|Balthamos]] is a rebel angel who, with his lover Baruch, join in Will's journey to find the captured Lyra. Near the end of the story, he saves both Lyra's and Will's lives by killing Father Gomez. Upon ensuring their safety, Balthamos calls out Baruch's name and dies.\n*Tony Makarios is a naive boy who is lured into captivity by Mrs Coulter.\n*[[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]] are four-legged wheeled animals; they have one leg in front, one in back, and one on each side. The \"wheels\" are huge, round, hard seed-pods from seed-pod trees; an axle-like claw at the end of each leg grips a seed-pod. The Mulefa society is primitive.\n\n== D\u00e6mons ==\n[[File:Dama z gronostajem.jpg|thumb|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' (1489\u201390), along with two portraits by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], helped inspire Pullman's \"d\u00e6mon\" concept.<ref name=\"butler\">{{Cite news|author=Robert Butler |title=An Interview with Philip Pullman |series=Intelligent Life |work=The Economist |date=3 December 2007 |url=http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/node/697 |accessdate=10 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305011900/http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/node/697 |archivedate=5 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\n{{Main|D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)}}\nOne distinctive aspect of Pullman's story is the presence of \"[[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]]s\" (pronounced \"demon\").

It is a generalization of the notion of a \"[[Line (mathematics)|straight line]]\" to a more general setting. \n\nThe terms \"geodesic\" and \"[[geodetic]]\" come from ''[[geodesy]]'', the science of measuring the size and shape of [[Earth]]. In the original sense, a geodesic was the shortest route between two points on the Earth's [[Planetary surface|surface]]. For a [[spherical Earth]], it is a [[line segment|segment]] of a [[great circle]].  The term has been generalized to include measurements in much more general mathematical spaces; for example, in [[graph theory]], one might consider a [[Distance (graph theory)|geodesic]] between two [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]/nodes of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].\n\nIn a Riemannian manifold or submanifold geodesics are characterised by the property of having vanishing [[geodesic curvature]]. More generally, in the presence of an [[affine connection]], a geodesic is defined to be a curve whose [[Tangent space|tangent vector]]s remain parallel if they are [[parallel transport|transported]] along it. Applying this to the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of a [[Riemannian metric]] recovers the previous notion.\n\nGeodesics are of particular importance in [[general relativity]].  Timelike [[geodesics in general relativity]] describe the motion of [[free fall]]ing [[test particles]].\n\n==Introduction==\nThe shortest path between two given points in a curved space, assumed to be a [[differential manifold]], can be defined by using the [[equation]] for the [[Arc length|length]] of a [[curve]] (a function ''f'' from an [[open interval]] of '''[[Real number line|R]]''' to the space), and then minimizing this length between the points using the [[calculus of variations]]. This has some minor technical problems, because there is an infinite dimensional space of different ways to parameterize the shortest path. It is simpler to restrict the set of curves to those that are parameterized \"with constant speed\" 1, meaning that  the distance from ''f''(''s'') to ''f''(''t'') along the curve equals |''s''&minus;''t''|. Equivalently, a different quantity may be used, termed the energy of the curve; minimizing the energy leads to the same equations for a geodesic (here \"constant velocity\" is a consequence of minimization).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Intuitively, one can understand this second formulation by noting that an [[elastic band]] stretched between two points will contract its length, and in so doing will minimize its energy.  The resulting shape of the band is a geodesic.\n\nIt is possible that several different curves between two points minimize the distance, as is the case for two diametrically opposite points on a sphere. In such a case, any of these curves is a geodesic.\n\nA contiguous segment of a geodesic is again a geodesic.\n\nIn general, geodesics are not the same as \"shortest curves\" between two points, though the two concepts are closely related. The difference is that geodesics are only ''locally'' the shortest distance between points, and are parameterized with \"constant speed\". Going the \"long way round\" on a [[great circle]] between two points on a sphere is a geodesic but not the shortest path between the points. The map ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''t''<sup>2</sup> from the unit interval on the real number line to itself gives the shortest path between 0 and 1, but is not a geodesic because the velocity of the corresponding motion of a point is not constant.\n\nGeodesics are commonly seen in the study of [[Riemannian geometry]] and more generally [[metric geometry]]. In [[general relativity]], geodesics in [[spacetime]] describe the motion of [[point particle]]s under the influence of gravity alone. In particular, the path taken by a falling rock, an orbiting [[satellite]], or the shape of a [[planetary orbit]] are all geodesics in curved spacetime. More generally, the topic of [[sub-Riemannian geometry]] deals with the paths that objects may take when they are not free, and their movement is constrained in various ways.\n\nThis article presents the mathematical formalism involved in defining, finding, and proving the existence of geodesics, in the case of [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] and [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.  The article [[geodesic (general relativity)]] discusses the special case of general relativity in greater detail.\n\n===Examples===\n[[File:Transpolar geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid case A.svg|thumb|right|200px|\nA [[geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid|geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid]].]]\n[[File:Insect on a torus tracing out a non-trivial geodesic.gif|thumb|right|If an insect is placed on a surface and continually walks \"forward\", by definition it will trace out a geodesic.]]\nThe most familiar examples are the straight lines in [[Euclidean geometry]]. On a  [[sphere]], the images of geodesics are the  [[great circle]]s. The shortest path from point ''A'' to point ''B'' on a sphere is given by the shorter [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of the great circle passing through ''A'' and ''B''. If ''A'' and ''B'' are [[antipodal point]]s, then there are ''infinitely many'' shortest paths between them.  [[Geodesics on an ellipsoid]] behave in a more complicated way than on a sphere; in particular, they are not closed in general (see figure).\n\n==Metric geometry==\nIn [[metric geometry]], a geodesic is a curve which is everywhere [[locally]] a [[distance]] minimizer. More precisely, a [[curve]] {{nowrap|''\u03b3'' : ''I'' \u2192 ''M''}} from an interval ''I'' of the reals to the [[metric space]] ''M'' is a '''geodesic''' if there is a [[mathematical constant|constant]] {{nowrap|''v'' \u2265 0}} such that for any {{nowrap|''t'' \u2208 ''I''}} there is a neighborhood ''J'' of ''t'' in ''I'' such that for any {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>,\u2009''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''J''}} we have\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = v \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nThis generalizes the notion of geodesic for Riemannian manifolds. However, in metric geometry the geodesic considered is often equipped with [[Curve#Lengths of curves|natural parameterization]], i.e. in the above identity ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nIf the last equality is satisfied for all {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''I''}}, the geodesic is called a '''minimizing geodesic''' or '''shortest path'''.\n\nIn general, a metric space may have no geodesics, except constant curves. At the other extreme, any two points in a [[length metric space]] are joined by a minimizing sequence of [[rectifiable path]]s, although this minimizing sequence need not converge to a geodesic.\n\n==Riemannian geometry==\nIn a [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M'' with [[metric tensor]] ''g'', the length ''L'' of a continuously differentiable curve \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' is defined by\n:<math>L(\\gamma)=\\int_a^b \\sqrt{  g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t)) }\\,dt.</math>\nThe distance ''d''(''p'',\u2009''q'') between two points ''p'' and ''q'' of ''M'' is defined as the [[infimum]] of the length taken over all continuous, piecewise continuously differentiable curves \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' such that \u03b3(''a'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p'' and \u03b3(''b'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''. In Riemannian geometry, all geodesics are locally distance-minimizing paths, but the converse is not true. In fact, only paths that are both locally distance minimizing and parameterized proportionately to arc-length are geodesics. Another equivalent way of defining geodesics on a Riemannian manifold, is to define them as the minima of the following [[action (physics)|action]] or [[energy functional]]\n:<math>E(\\gamma)=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_a^b g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t))\\,dt.</math>\nAll minima of ''E'' are also minima of ''L'', but ''L'' is a bigger set since paths that are minima of ''L'' can be arbitrarily re-parameterized, while minima of ''E'' cannot.\nFor a piecewise <math>C^1</math> curve (more generally, a <math>W^{1,2}</math> curve), the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]] gives\n:<math>L(\\gamma)^2 \\le 2(b-a)E(\\gamma)</math>\nwith equality if and only if <math>g(\\gamma',\\gamma')</math> is equal to a constant a.e.  It happens that minimizers of <math>E(\\gamma)</math> also minimize <math>L(\\gamma)</math>, because they turn out to be affinely parameterized, and the inequality is an equality.  The usefulness of this approach is that the problem of seeking minimizers of ''E'' is a more robust variational problem.  Indeed, ''E'' is a \"convex function\" of <math>\\gamma</math>, so that within each isotopy class of \"reasonable functions\", one ought to expect existence, uniqueness, and regularity of minimizers.  In contrast, \"minimizers\" of the functional <math>L(\\gamma)</math> are generally not very regular, because arbitrary reparameterizations are allowed.\n\nThe [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s of motion for the functional ''E'' are then given in local coordinates by\n:<math>\\frac{d^2x^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{dx^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{dx^\\nu }{dt} = 0,</math>\nwhere <math>\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}</math> are the [[Christoffel symbols]] of the metric.  This is the '''geodesic equation''', discussed [[#Affine geodesics|below]].\n\n===Calculus of variations===\n\nTechniques of the classical [[calculus of variations]] can be applied to examine the energy functional ''E''.  The [[first variation]] of energy is defined in local coordinates by\n\n:<math>\\delta E(\\gamma)(\\varphi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi).</math>\n\nThe [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s of the first variation are precisely the geodesics.  The [[second variation]] is defined by\n\n:<math>\\delta^2 E(\\gamma)(\\varphi,\\psi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial s \\, \\partial t} \\right|_{s=t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi + s\\psi).</math>\n\nIn an appropriate sense, zeros of the second variation along a geodesic \u03b3 arise along [[Jacobi field]]s.  Jacobi fields are thus regarded as variations through geodesics.\n\nBy applying variational techniques from [[classical mechanics]], one can also regard [[geodesics as Hamiltonian flows]].  They are solutions of the associated [[Hamilton equation]]s, with (pseudo-)Riemannian metric taken as [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].\n\n==Affine geodesics==\n{{See also|Geodesics in general relativity}}\nA '''geodesic''' on a [[Differentiable manifold|smooth manifold]]  ''M'' with an [[affine connection]]  \u2207 is defined as a [[curve]] \u03b3(''t'') such that [[parallel transport]] along the curve preserves the tangent vector to the curve, so\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nat each point along the curve,  where <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> is the derivative with respect to <math>t</math>.  More precisely, in order to define the covariant derivative of <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> it is necessary first to extend <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> to a continuously differentiable [[vector field]] in an [[open set]].  However, the resulting value of ({{EquationNote|1}}) is independent of the choice of extension.\n\nUsing [[local coordinates]] on ''M'', we can write the '''geodesic equation''' (using the [[summation convention]]) as\n:<math>\\frac{d^2\\gamma^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{d\\gamma^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{d\\gamma^\\nu }{dt} = 0\\ ,</math>\nwhere <math>\\gamma^\\mu = x^\\mu \\circ \\gamma (t)</math> are the coordinates of the curve \u03b3(''t'') and <math>\\Gamma^{\\lambda }_{\\mu \\nu }</math> are the [[Christoffel symbol]]s of the connection \u2207.  This is an [[ordinary differential equation]] for the coordinates.  It has a unique solution, given an initial position and an initial velocity.  Therefore, from the point of view of [[classical mechanics]], geodesics can be thought of as trajectories of [[free particle]]s in a manifold. Indeed, the equation <math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math> means that the [[Acceleration (differential geometry)|acceleration vector]] of the curve has no components in the direction of the surface (and therefore it is perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at each point of the curve). So, the motion is completely determined by the bending of the surface. This is also the idea of general relativity where particles move on geodesics and the bending is caused by the gravity.\n\n===Existence and uniqueness===\nThe ''local existence and uniqueness theorem'' for geodesics states that geodesics on a smooth manifold with an [[affine connection]] exist, and are unique.  More precisely:\n\n:For any point ''p'' in ''M'' and for any vector ''V'' in ''T<sub>p</sub>M'' (the [[tangent space]] to ''M'' at ''p'') there exists a unique geodesic <math>\\gamma \\,</math> : ''I'' &rarr; ''M'' such that\n::<math>\\gamma(0) = p \\,</math> and\n::<math>\\dot\\gamma(0) = V,</math>\n:where ''I'' is a maximal [[open interval]] in '''R''' containing 0.\n\nThe proof of this theorem follows from the theory of  [[ordinary differential equation]]s, by noticing that the geodesic equation is a second-order ODE. Existence and uniqueness then follow from the [[Picard&ndash;Lindel\u00f6f theorem]] for the solutions of ODEs with prescribed initial conditions. \u03b3 depends [[smooth function|smoothly]] on both ''p'' and&nbsp;''V''.  \n\nIn general, ''I'' may not be all of '''R''' as for example for an open disc in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. Any {{mvar|\u03b3}} extends to all of {{mvar|\u211d}} if and only if {{mvar|M}} is [[geodesic manifold|geodesically complete]].\n\n===Geodesic flow===\nGeodesic [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]] is a local '''R'''-[[Group action (mathematics)|action]] on the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' of a manifold ''M'' defined in the following way\n\n:<math>G^t(V)=\\dot\\gamma_V(t)</math>\n\nwhere ''t''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''R''', ''V''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''TM'' and <math>\\gamma_V</math> denotes the geodesic with initial data <math>\\dot\\gamma_V(0)=V</math>. Thus,  ''<math>G^t</math>''(''V'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;exp(''tV'') is the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] of the vector ''tV''.  A closed orbit of the geodesic flow corresponds to a [[closed geodesic]] on&nbsp;''M''.\n\nOn a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, the geodesic flow is identified with a [[Hamiltonian flow]] on the cotangent bundle.  The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] is then given by the inverse of the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric, evaluated against the [[canonical one-form]]. In particular the flow preserves the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric <math>g</math>, i.e.\n\n: <math>g(G^t(V),G^t(V))=g(V,V). \\, </math>\n\nIn particular, when ''V'' is a unit vector, <math>\\gamma_V</math> remains unit speed throughout, so the geodesic flow is tangent to the [[unit tangent bundle]].  [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] implies invariance of a kinematic measure on the unit tangent bundle.\n\n===Geodesic spray===\nThe geodesic flow defines a family of curves in the [[tangent bundle]]. The derivatives of these curves define a [[vector field]]  on the [[total space]] of the tangent bundle, known as the [[spray (mathematics)|geodesic spray]].\n\nMore precisely, an affine connection gives rise to a splitting of the [[double tangent bundle]] TT''M'' into [[horizontal bundle|horizontal]] and [[vertical bundle]]s:\n:<math>TTM = H\\oplus V.</math>\nThe geodesic spray is the unique horizontal vector field ''W'' satisfying\n:<math>\\pi_* W_v = v\\,</math>\nat each point ''v''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''; here \u03c0<sub>\u2217</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;TT''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;T''M'' denotes the [[pushforward (differential)]] along the projection \u03c0&nbsp;:&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' associated to the tangent bundle.\n\nMore generally, the same construction allows one to construct a vector field for any [[Ehresmann connection]] on the tangent bundle.  For the resulting vector field to be a spray (on the deleted tangent bundle T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0}) it is enough that the connection be equivariant under positive rescalings: it need not be linear.  That is, (cf. [[Ehresmann connection#Vector bundles and covariant derivatives]]) it is enough that the horizontal distribution satisfy\n:<math>H_{\\lambda X} = d(S_\\lambda)_X H_X\\,</math>\nfor every ''X''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0} and \u03bb&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.  Here ''d''(''S''<sub>\u03bb</sub>) is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] along the scalar homothety <math>S_\\lambda: X\\mapsto \\lambda X.</math>  A particular case of a non-linear connection arising in this manner is that associated to a [[Finsler manifold]].\n\n===Affine and projective geodesics===\nEquation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is invariant under affine reparameterizations; that is, parameterizations of the form\n:<math>t\\mapsto at+b</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are constant real numbers. Thus apart from specifying a certain class of embedded curves, the geodesic equation also determines a preferred class of parameterizations on each of the curves. Accordingly, solutions of ({{EquationNote|1}}) are called geodesics with '''affine parameter'''.\n\nAn affine connection is ''determined by'' its family of affinely parameterized geodesics, up to [[torsion tensor|torsion]] {{harv|Spivak|1999|loc=Chapter 6, Addendum I}}.  The torsion itself does not, in fact, affect the family of geodesics, since the geodesic equation depends only on the symmetric part of the connection.  More precisely, if <math>\\nabla, \\bar{\\nabla}</math> are two connections such that the difference tensor\n:<math>D(X,Y) = \\nabla_XY-\\bar{\\nabla}_XY</math>\nis [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]], then <math>\\nabla</math> and <math>\\bar{\\nabla}</math> have the same geodesics, with the same affine parameterizations. Furthermore, there is a unique connection having the same geodesics as  <math>\\nabla</math>, but with vanishing torsion.\n\nGeodesics without a particular parameterization are described by a [[projective connection]].\n\n==Computational methods==\nEfficient solvers for the minimal geodesic problem on surfaces posed as [[eikonal equation]]s have been proposed by Kimmel and others.<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Kimmel |first2=A. |last2=Amir |first3=A.

It is a generalization of the notion of a \"[[Line (mathematics)|straight line]]\" to a more general setting. \n\nThe terms \"geodesic\" and \"geodetic\" come from ''[[geodesy]]'', the science of measuring the size and shape of [[Earth]]. In the original sense, a geodesic was the shortest route between two points on the Earth's [[Planetary surface|surface]]. For a [[spherical Earth]], it is a [[line segment|segment]] of a [[great circle]].  The term has been generalized to include measurements in much more general mathematical spaces; for example, in [[graph theory]], one might consider a [[Distance (graph theory)|geodesic]] between two [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]/nodes of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].\n\nIn a Riemannian manifold or submanifold geodesics are characterised by the property of having vanishing [[geodesic curvature]]. More generally, in the presence of an [[affine connection]], a geodesic is defined to be a curve whose [[Tangent space|tangent vector]]s remain parallel if they are [[parallel transport|transported]] along it. Applying this to the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of a [[Riemannian metric]] recovers the previous notion.\n\nGeodesics are of particular importance in [[general relativity]].  Timelike [[geodesics in general relativity]] describe the motion of [[free fall]]ing [[test particles]].\n\n==Introduction==\nThe shortest path between two given points in a curved space, assumed to be a [[differential manifold]], can be defined by using the [[equation]] for the [[Arc length|length]] of a [[curve]] (a function ''f'' from an [[open interval]] of '''[[Real number line|R]]''' to the space), and then minimizing this length between the points using the [[calculus of variations]]. This has some minor technical problems, because there is an infinite dimensional space of different ways to parameterize the shortest path. It is simpler to restrict the set of curves to those that are parameterized \"with constant speed\" 1, meaning that  the distance from ''f''(''s'') to ''f''(''t'') along the curve equals |''s''&minus;''t''|. Equivalently, a different quantity may be used, termed the energy of the curve; minimizing the energy leads to the same equations for a geodesic (here \"constant velocity\" is a consequence of minimization).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Intuitively, one can understand this second formulation by noting that an [[elastic band]] stretched between two points will contract its length, and in so doing will minimize its energy.  The resulting shape of the band is a geodesic.\n\nIt is possible that several different curves between two points minimize the distance, as is the case for two diametrically opposite points on a sphere. In such a case, any of these curves is a geodesic.\n\nA contiguous segment of a geodesic is again a geodesic.\n\nIn general, geodesics are not the same as \"shortest curves\" between two points, though the two concepts are closely related. The difference is that geodesics are only ''locally'' the shortest distance between points, and are parameterized with \"constant speed\". Going the \"long way round\" on a [[great circle]] between two points on a sphere is a geodesic but not the shortest path between the points. The map ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''t''<sup>2</sup> from the unit interval on the real number line to itself gives the shortest path between 0 and 1, but is not a geodesic because the velocity of the corresponding motion of a point is not constant.\n\nGeodesics are commonly seen in the study of [[Riemannian geometry]] and more generally [[metric geometry]]. In [[general relativity]], geodesics in [[spacetime]] describe the motion of [[point particle]]s under the influence of gravity alone. In particular, the path taken by a falling rock, an orbiting [[satellite]], or the shape of a [[planetary orbit]] are all geodesics in curved spacetime. More generally, the topic of [[sub-Riemannian geometry]] deals with the paths that objects may take when they are not free, and their movement is constrained in various ways.\n\nThis article presents the mathematical formalism involved in defining, finding, and proving the existence of geodesics, in the case of [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] and [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.  The article [[geodesic (general relativity)]] discusses the special case of general relativity in greater detail.\n\n===Examples===\n[[File:Transpolar geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid case A.svg|thumb|right|200px|\nA [[geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid|geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid]].]]\n[[File:Insect on a torus tracing out a non-trivial geodesic.gif|thumb|right|If an insect is placed on a surface and continually walks \"forward\", by definition it will trace out a geodesic.]]\nThe most familiar examples are the straight lines in [[Euclidean geometry]]. On a  [[sphere]], the images of geodesics are the  [[great circle]]s. The shortest path from point ''A'' to point ''B'' on a sphere is given by the shorter [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of the great circle passing through ''A'' and ''B''. If ''A'' and ''B'' are [[antipodal point]]s, then there are ''infinitely many'' shortest paths between them.  [[Geodesics on an ellipsoid]] behave in a more complicated way than on a sphere; in particular, they are not closed in general (see figure).\n\n==Metric geometry==\nIn [[metric geometry]], a geodesic is a curve which is everywhere [[locally]] a [[distance]] minimizer. More precisely, a [[curve]] {{nowrap|''\u03b3'' : ''I'' \u2192 ''M''}} from an interval ''I'' of the reals to the [[metric space]] ''M'' is a '''geodesic''' if there is a [[mathematical constant|constant]] {{nowrap|''v'' \u2265 0}} such that for any {{nowrap|''t'' \u2208 ''I''}} there is a neighborhood ''J'' of ''t'' in ''I'' such that for any {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>,\u2009''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''J''}} we have\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = v \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nThis generalizes the notion of geodesic for Riemannian manifolds. However, in metric geometry the geodesic considered is often equipped with [[Curve#Lengths of curves|natural parameterization]], i.e. in the above identity ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nIf the last equality is satisfied for all {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''I''}}, the geodesic is called a '''minimizing geodesic''' or '''shortest path'''.\n\nIn general, a metric space may have no geodesics, except constant curves. At the other extreme, any two points in a [[length metric space]] are joined by a minimizing sequence of [[rectifiable path]]s, although this minimizing sequence need not converge to a geodesic.\n\n==Riemannian geometry==\nIn a [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M'' with [[metric tensor]] ''g'', the length ''L'' of a continuously differentiable curve \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' is defined by\n:<math>L(\\gamma)=\\int_a^b \\sqrt{  g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t)) }\\,dt.</math>\nThe distance ''d''(''p'',\u2009''q'') between two points ''p'' and ''q'' of ''M'' is defined as the [[infimum]] of the length taken over all continuous, piecewise continuously differentiable curves \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' such that \u03b3(''a'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p'' and \u03b3(''b'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''. In Riemannian geometry, all geodesics are locally distance-minimizing paths, but the converse is not true. In fact, only paths that are both locally distance minimizing and parameterized proportionately to arc-length are geodesics. Another equivalent way of defining geodesics on a Riemannian manifold, is to define them as the minima of the following [[action (physics)|action]] or [[energy functional]]\n:<math>E(\\gamma)=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_a^b g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t))\\,dt.</math>\nAll minima of ''E'' are also minima of ''L'', but ''L'' is a bigger set since paths that are minima of ''L'' can be arbitrarily re-parameterized, while minima of ''E'' cannot.\nFor a piecewise <math>C^1</math> curve (more generally, a <math>W^{1,2}</math> curve), the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]] gives\n:<math>L(\\gamma)^2 \\le 2(b-a)E(\\gamma)</math>\nwith equality if and only if <math>g(\\gamma',\\gamma')</math> is equal to a constant a.e.  It happens that minimizers of <math>E(\\gamma)</math> also minimize <math>L(\\gamma)</math>, because they turn out to be affinely parameterized, and the inequality is an equality.  The usefulness of this approach is that the problem of seeking minimizers of ''E'' is a more robust variational problem.  Indeed, ''E'' is a \"convex function\" of <math>\\gamma</math>, so that within each isotopy class of \"reasonable functions\", one ought to expect existence, uniqueness, and regularity of minimizers.  In contrast, \"minimizers\" of the functional <math>L(\\gamma)</math> are generally not very regular, because arbitrary reparameterizations are allowed.\n\nThe [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s of motion for the functional ''E'' are then given in local coordinates by\n:<math>\\frac{d^2x^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{dx^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{dx^\\nu }{dt} = 0,</math>\nwhere <math>\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}</math> are the [[Christoffel symbols]] of the metric.  This is the '''geodesic equation''', discussed [[#Affine geodesics|below]].\n\n===Calculus of variations===\n\nTechniques of the classical [[calculus of variations]] can be applied to examine the energy functional ''E''.  The [[first variation]] of energy is defined in local coordinates by\n\n:<math>\\delta E(\\gamma)(\\varphi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi).</math>\n\nThe [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s of the first variation are precisely the geodesics.  The [[second variation]] is defined by\n\n:<math>\\delta^2 E(\\gamma)(\\varphi,\\psi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial s \\, \\partial t} \\right|_{s=t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi + s\\psi).</math>\n\nIn an appropriate sense, zeros of the second variation along a geodesic \u03b3 arise along [[Jacobi field]]s.  Jacobi fields are thus regarded as variations through geodesics.\n\nBy applying variational techniques from [[classical mechanics]], one can also regard [[geodesics as Hamiltonian flows]].  They are solutions of the associated [[Hamilton equation]]s, with (pseudo-)Riemannian metric taken as [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].\n\n==Affine geodesics==\n{{See also|Geodesics in general relativity}}\nA '''geodesic''' on a [[Differentiable manifold|smooth manifold]]  ''M'' with an [[affine connection]]  \u2207 is defined as a [[curve]] \u03b3(''t'') such that [[parallel transport]] along the curve preserves the tangent vector to the curve, so\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nat each point along the curve,  where <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> is the derivative with respect to <math>t</math>.  More precisely, in order to define the covariant derivative of <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> it is necessary first to extend <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> to a continuously differentiable [[vector field]] in an [[open set]].  However, the resulting value of ({{EquationNote|1}}) is independent of the choice of extension.\n\nUsing [[local coordinates]] on ''M'', we can write the '''geodesic equation''' (using the [[summation convention]]) as\n:<math>\\frac{d^2\\gamma^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{d\\gamma^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{d\\gamma^\\nu }{dt} = 0\\ ,</math>\nwhere <math>\\gamma^\\mu = x^\\mu \\circ \\gamma (t)</math> are the coordinates of the curve \u03b3(''t'') and <math>\\Gamma^{\\lambda }_{\\mu \\nu }</math> are the [[Christoffel symbol]]s of the connection \u2207.  This is an [[ordinary differential equation]] for the coordinates.  It has a unique solution, given an initial position and an initial velocity.  Therefore, from the point of view of [[classical mechanics]], geodesics can be thought of as trajectories of [[free particle]]s in a manifold. Indeed, the equation <math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math> means that the [[Acceleration (differential geometry)|acceleration vector]] of the curve has no components in the direction of the surface (and therefore it is perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at each point of the curve). So, the motion is completely determined by the bending of the surface. This is also the idea of general relativity where particles move on geodesics and the bending is caused by the gravity.\n\n===Existence and uniqueness===\nThe ''local existence and uniqueness theorem'' for geodesics states that geodesics on a smooth manifold with an [[affine connection]] exist, and are unique.  More precisely:\n\n:For any point ''p'' in ''M'' and for any vector ''V'' in ''T<sub>p</sub>M'' (the [[tangent space]] to ''M'' at ''p'') there exists a unique geodesic <math>\\gamma \\,</math> : ''I'' &rarr; ''M'' such that\n::<math>\\gamma(0) = p \\,</math> and\n::<math>\\dot\\gamma(0) = V,</math>\n:where ''I'' is a maximal [[open interval]] in '''R''' containing 0.\n\nThe proof of this theorem follows from the theory of  [[ordinary differential equation]]s, by noticing that the geodesic equation is a second-order ODE. Existence and uniqueness then follow from the [[Picard&ndash;Lindel\u00f6f theorem]] for the solutions of ODEs with prescribed initial conditions. \u03b3 depends [[smooth function|smoothly]] on both ''p'' and&nbsp;''V''.  \n\nIn general, ''I'' may not be all of '''R''' as for example for an open disc in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. Any {{mvar|\u03b3}} extends to all of {{mvar|\u211d}} if and only if {{mvar|M}} is [[geodesic manifold|geodesically complete]].\n\n===Geodesic flow===\nGeodesic [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]] is a local '''R'''-[[Group action (mathematics)|action]] on the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' of a manifold ''M'' defined in the following way\n\n:<math>G^t(V)=\\dot\\gamma_V(t)</math>\n\nwhere ''t''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''R''', ''V''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''TM'' and <math>\\gamma_V</math> denotes the geodesic with initial data <math>\\dot\\gamma_V(0)=V</math>. Thus,  ''<math>G^t</math>''(''V'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;exp(''tV'') is the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] of the vector ''tV''.  A closed orbit of the geodesic flow corresponds to a [[closed geodesic]] on&nbsp;''M''.\n\nOn a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, the geodesic flow is identified with a [[Hamiltonian flow]] on the cotangent bundle.  The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] is then given by the inverse of the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric, evaluated against the [[canonical one-form]]. In particular the flow preserves the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric <math>g</math>, i.e.\n\n: <math>g(G^t(V),G^t(V))=g(V,V). \\, </math>\n\nIn particular, when ''V'' is a unit vector, <math>\\gamma_V</math> remains unit speed throughout, so the geodesic flow is tangent to the [[unit tangent bundle]].  [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] implies invariance of a kinematic measure on the unit tangent bundle.\n\n===Geodesic spray===\nThe geodesic flow defines a family of curves in the [[tangent bundle]]. The derivatives of these curves define a [[vector field]]  on the [[total space]] of the tangent bundle, known as the [[spray (mathematics)|geodesic spray]].\n\nMore precisely, an affine connection gives rise to a splitting of the [[double tangent bundle]] TT''M'' into [[horizontal bundle|horizontal]] and [[vertical bundle]]s:\n:<math>TTM = H\\oplus V.</math>\nThe geodesic spray is the unique horizontal vector field ''W'' satisfying\n:<math>\\pi_* W_v = v\\,</math>\nat each point ''v''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''; here \u03c0<sub>\u2217</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;TT''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;T''M'' denotes the [[pushforward (differential)]] along the projection \u03c0&nbsp;:&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' associated to the tangent bundle.\n\nMore generally, the same construction allows one to construct a vector field for any [[Ehresmann connection]] on the tangent bundle.  For the resulting vector field to be a spray (on the deleted tangent bundle T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0}) it is enough that the connection be equivariant under positive rescalings: it need not be linear.  That is, (cf. [[Ehresmann connection#Vector bundles and covariant derivatives]]) it is enough that the horizontal distribution satisfy\n:<math>H_{\\lambda X} = d(S_\\lambda)_X H_X\\,</math>\nfor every ''X''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0} and \u03bb&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.  Here ''d''(''S''<sub>\u03bb</sub>) is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] along the scalar homothety <math>S_\\lambda: X\\mapsto \\lambda X.</math>  A particular case of a non-linear connection arising in this manner is that associated to a [[Finsler manifold]].\n\n===Affine and projective geodesics===\nEquation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is invariant under affine reparameterizations; that is, parameterizations of the form\n:<math>t\\mapsto at+b</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are constant real numbers. Thus apart from specifying a certain class of embedded curves, the geodesic equation also determines a preferred class of parameterizations on each of the curves. Accordingly, solutions of ({{EquationNote|1}}) are called geodesics with '''affine parameter'''.\n\nAn affine connection is ''determined by'' its family of affinely parameterized geodesics, up to [[torsion tensor|torsion]] {{harv|Spivak|1999|loc=Chapter 6, Addendum I}}.  The torsion itself does not, in fact, affect the family of geodesics, since the geodesic equation depends only on the symmetric part of the connection.  More precisely, if <math>\\nabla, \\bar{\\nabla}</math> are two connections such that the difference tensor\n:<math>D(X,Y) = \\nabla_XY-\\bar{\\nabla}_XY</math>\nis [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]], then <math>\\nabla</math> and <math>\\bar{\\nabla}</math> have the same geodesics, with the same affine parameterizations. Furthermore, there is a unique connection having the same geodesics as  <math>\\nabla</math>, but with vanishing torsion.\n\nGeodesics without a particular parameterization are described by a [[projective connection]].\n\n==Computational methods==\nEfficient solvers for the minimal geodesic problem on surfaces posed as [[eikonal equation]]s have been proposed by Kimmel and others.<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Kimmel |first2=A. |last2=Amir |first3=A.
