Chapa, Mika, Miles, and Bose have been referred to as Spicy Milk, Oopsie Girl, Wing Wimp, and Gorgeous Hair Boy when the disastrous interview goes viral. They want to be referred to as Volt, AWOL, Shout-Out, and Brainstorm. Schwoz states if the news uses their dumb name three times, it will stick. Captain Man stated that he got his name said three times thanks to a DJ named Coyote Jake. Their first attempt to get their right names said is to get a toddler that Bose mistook for Toddler named Ellis back to his parents. Mika and Miles go to Hip Hop Puree to meet a vlogger named Natalie Mazdah who sat on the same airplane that [[Emma Watson]] rode where they plan to get her to say the names of their superhero forms three times. When the Danger Force tries to get her to say their name, Hip Hop Pureee is visited by the Toddler and his henchmen. As their powers haven't been perfected, the Danger Force struggles to defeat the Toddler and his men until they use spicy milk on them. After the Toddler flees, Ellis' dads arrive to pick up Ellis who calls the Danger Force by their real superhero names. Natalie does a viral video as Trent and Mary finally say the names three times which pleases the Danger Force.\n| LineColor       = F46D25\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Captain Mayonnaise\n| AltTitle        = Ray Goes Cray\n| DirectedBy      = Evelyn Belasco\n| WrittenBy       = Samantha Martin\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|11}}\n| ProdCode        = 102\n| Viewers         = 0.65<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-saturday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-11-2020.html|title=Top 150 Saturday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.11.2020|work=[[Showbuzz Daily]]|author=[[Mitch Metcalf]]|date=April 14, 2020|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Sharona Shapen arrives at the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where is she now working for Swellview as a school inspector after getting fired from her teaching job at Swellview Junior High. In order to get a license to run the school, she wants to see all types of education or she will be shutting it down. The next day, Shapen watches the education and rates every lesson. After passing, Shapen gets them two new students she found a bus stop due to a shortage of entries at the local gifted school. Schwoz finds a loophole in which they can get the students to leave on their own if it is miserable. The next day, Shapen arrives with the kids Percy and Miriam who are sweet. Chapa states Percy and Miriam will affect their response to criminal activity. Early the next morning, Captain Man and Danger Force come in after a night of crime-fighting. As Ray didn't get any sleep, Schwoz warns them that he will turn bad if he doesn't get enough sleep. This causes Ray to plot to use a mayonaise container filled with flesh-eating bacteria at them. Chapa, Mika, Miles, and Bose work to keep Percy and Miriam safe from an exhausted Ray. The mayonnaise container breaks on Ray as Shapen comes in after obtaining an opening in a Bordertown school for poor gifted children. As she takes Percy and Miriam away, Shapen states that the school can keep it's license as she won't send any other children here.

Today, about three quarters of the Vlach population speak the Ungurean [[subdialect]] which is similar to the Romanian spoken in [[Banat]]. In the 19th century other groups of Romanians originating in [[Oltenia]] (Lesser Wallachia) also settled south of the Danube.<ref>{{in lang|sr}} Kosta Jovanovi\u0107, ''Negotinska Krajina i Klju\u010d'', Belgrade, 1940</ref> These are the \u021a\u0103rani (''Carani'', \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438), who form some 25% of the modern population and speak a variety of Oltenian dialect. From the 15th through the 18th centuries large numbers of Serbs also migrated across the Danube, but in the opposite direction, to both Banat and \u021aara Rom\u00e2neasca. Significant migration ended by the establishment of the kingdoms of Serbia and Romania in the second half of the 19th century. The Vlachs of northeastern Serbia share close linguistic and cultural ties with the Vlachs in the region of Vidin in Bulgaria as well as the Romanians of [[Banat]] and [[Oltenia]] (Lesser Wallachia).

The \u0162\u0103rani have the saying \"''Nu dau un leu pe el''\" (He's not worth even a [[Romanian leu|leu]]). The reference to \"leu\" (lion) as currency most likely goes back to the 17th century when the Dutch-issued daalder (leeuwendaalder) bearing the image of a lion was in circulation in the Romanian principalities and elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire whose own currency was habitually being debased by the government. In the Romanian principalities, as well as in Bulgaria, the ''leeuwendaalder'' (in Romanian and Bulgarian ''leu'' and ''lev'', respectively) came to symbolize a strong currency. Indeed, on gaining independence in the 19th century both countries adopted this name for their new currencies. Since newly independent Serbia named its currency (the [[dinar]]) after the Roman ''[[denarius]]'', the reference to the ''leu'' among the \u0162\u0103rani is an indication of their connection to, if not origin in, what is now Romania.\n* the '''Ungureni''' or Ungureani (Ungurjani) of [[Homolje]] are related to the Romanians of [[Banat]] and [[Transylvania]], since ''Ungureni'' (compare with the word \"[[Hungarians]]\") is a term used by the Romanians of [[Wallachia]] to refer to their kin who once lived in provinces formerly part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The connection is evident not only in vocabulary, but also in the similarities of dialectal phonology and folk music motifs, as well as in sayings such as \"''Duc\u0103-se pe [[Mure\u015f River|Mure\u015f]]''\" (May the Mure\u015f take him/it away), a reference to the Transylvanian river.

The Vlach community is highly assimilated into Serbian society, bilingual in the Serbian and Vlach languages, and adhering to the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nDespite their recognition as a separate ethnic group by the Serbian government, Vlachs are cognate to Romanians in the cultural and linguistic sense. Some Romanians, as well as international linguists and anthropologists, consider Serbia's Vlachs to be a subgroup of Romanians. Additionally, the Movement of Romanians-Vlachs in Serbia, which represents some Vlachs, has called for the recognition of the Vlachs as a Romanian national minority, giving them rights similar to those of the [[Romanians of Serbia|Romanians of Vojvodina]]. However, the results of the last census showed that most Vlachs of Eastern Serbia opted for the Serbian [[exonym]] ''vlasi'' (= Vlachs) rather than ''rumuni'' (= Romanians).<ref name=\"popis2002\"/> As a result of [[serbianization]], most Vlachs declared themselves to be \"Serbs\" on censusus taken by [[Communist Yugoslavia]], but the number of those who preferred to declare themselves as Vlachs or Romanians significantly increased from 1991 (16,539 declared ''vlasi'' and 42 declared ''rumuni'') to 2001 (39,953 declared ''vlasi'' and 4,157 declared ''rumuni'').\n\nRomania has given modest financial support to the Vlachs in Serbia for the preservation of their culture and language, since at present the Vlachs' language is not recognized officially in any localities where they form a majority, there is no education in their mother tongue, and there is no Vlach media or education funded by the Serbian state. There are also no church services in Vlach. Until very recently in the regions populated by Vlachs the official policy of the Serbian Orthodox church opposed the giving of non-Serbian baptismal names.\n\nOn the other hand, some Vlachs consider themselves to be simply [[Serbs]] that speak the ''[[Vlach language]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n[[Vlach]] is commonly used as a historical umbrella term for all Latin peoples in [[Southeastern Europe]] ([[Romanians]] proper or Daco-Romanians, [[Aromanians]], [[Megleno-Romanians]], [[Istro-Romanians]]). After the foundation of the Romanian state in the 19th century, Romanians living in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] and in [[Austria-Hungary]] were only seldom called \"Vlachs\" by foreigners, the use of the exonym \"Romanians\" was encouraged even by officials, and the Romanian population ceased to use the exonym \"Vlach\" for their own designation. Only in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and [[History of Bulgaria (1878\u20131946)|Bulgarian Kingdom]], where the officials did not encourage the population to use the modern exonym \"Romanian\", was the old designation \"Vlach\" retained, but the term \"Romanian\" was used in statistical reports (but only up to the [[Interwar period]], when the designation \"Romanian\" was changed into \"Vlach\").<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131215200852/http://www.timoc.org/54_Bor_12092005/BROSURA.pdf] Serbian/Romanian.

The \u0162\u0103rani have the saying \"''Nu dau un leu pe el''\" (He's not worth even a [[Romanian leu|leu]]). The reference to \"leu\" (lion) as currency most likely goes back to the 17th century when the Dutch-issued daalder (leeuwendaalder) bearing the image of a lion was in circulation in the Romanian principalities and elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire whose own currency was habitually being debased by the government. In the Romanian principalities, as well as in Bulgaria, the ''leeuwendaalder'' (in Romanian and Bulgarian ''leu'' and ''lev'', respectively) came to symbolize a strong currency. Indeed, on gaining independence in the 19th century both countries adopted this name for their new currencies. Since newly independent Serbia named its currency (the [[dinar]]) after the Roman ''[[denarius]]'', the reference to the ''leu'' among the \u0162\u0103rani is an indication of their connection to, if not origin in, what is now Romania.\n* the '''Ungureni''' or Ungureani (Ungurjani) of [[Homolje]] are related to the Romanians of [[Banat]] and [[Transylvania]], since ''Ungureni'' (compare with the word \"[[Hungarians]]\") is a term used by the Romanians of [[Wallachia]] to refer to their kin who once lived in provinces formerly part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The connection is evident not only in vocabulary, but also in the similarities of dialectal phonology and folk music motifs, as well as in sayings such as \"''Duc\u0103-se pe [[Mure\u015f River|Mure\u015f]]''\" (May the Mure\u015f take him/it away), a reference to the Transylvanian river.

The Vlach community is highly assimilated into Serbian society, bilingual in the Serbian and Vlach languages, and adhering to the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nDespite their recognition as a separate ethnic group by the Serbian government, Vlachs are cognate to Romanians in the cultural and linguistic sense. Some Romanians, as well as international linguists and anthropologists, consider Serbia's Vlachs to be a subgroup of Romanians. Additionally, the Movement of Romanians-Vlachs in Serbia, which represents some Vlachs, has called for the recognition of the Vlachs as a Romanian national minority, giving them rights similar to those of the [[Romanians of Serbia|Romanians of Vojvodina]]. However, the results of the last census showed that most Vlachs of Eastern Serbia opted for the Serbian [[exonym]] ''vlasi'' (= Vlachs) rather than ''rumuni'' (= Romanians).<ref name=\"popis2002\"/> As a result of [[serbianization]], most Vlachs declared themselves to be \"Serbs\" on censusus taken by [[Communist Yugoslavia]], but the number of those who preferred to declare themselves as Vlachs or Romanians significantly increased from 1991 (16,539 declared ''vlasi'' and 42 declared ''rumuni'') to 2001 (39,953 declared ''vlasi'' and 4,157 declared ''rumuni'').\n\nRomania has given modest financial support to the Vlachs in Serbia for the preservation of their culture and language, since at present the Vlachs' language is not recognized officially in any localities where they form a majority, there is no education in their mother tongue, and there is no Vlach media or education funded by the Serbian state. There are also no church services in Vlach. Until very recently in the regions populated by Vlachs the official policy of the Serbian Orthodox church opposed the giving of non-Serbian baptismal names.\n\nOn the other hand, some Vlachs consider themselves to be simply [[Serbs]] that speak the ''[[Vlach language]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n[[Vlach]] is commonly used as a historical umbrella term for all Latin peoples in [[Southeastern Europe]] ([[Romanians]] proper or Daco-Romanians, [[Aromanians]], [[Megleno-Romanians]], [[Istro-Romanians]]). After the foundation of the Romanian state in the 19th century, Romanians living in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] and in [[Austria-Hungary]] were only seldom called \"Vlachs\" by foreigners, the use of the exonym \"Romanians\" was encouraged even by officials, and the Romanian population ceased to use the exonym \"Vlach\" for their own designation. Only in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and [[History of Bulgaria (1878\u20131946)|Bulgarian Kingdom]], where the officials did not encourage the population to use the modern exonym \"Romanian\", was the old designation \"Vlach\" retained, but the term \"Romanian\" was used in statistical reports (but only up to the [[Interwar period]], when the designation \"Romanian\" was changed into \"Vlach\").<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131215200852/http://www.timoc.org/54_Bor_12092005/BROSURA.pdf] Serbian/Romanian.
