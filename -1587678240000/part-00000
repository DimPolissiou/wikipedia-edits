The mission received several extensions and lasted about 2,208 sols. On August 11, 2007, ''Spirit'' obtained the second longest operational duration on the surface of Mars for a lander or rover at 1282 Sols, one sol longer than the [[Viking 2]] lander. Viking 2 was powered by a nuclear cell whereas ''Spirit'' is powered by solar arrays. Until ''Opportunity'' overtook it on May 19, 2010, the Mars probe with longest operational period was [[Viking 1]] that lasted for 2245 Sols on the surface of Mars. On March 22, 2010, ''Spirit'' sent its last communication, thus falling just over a month short of surpassing Viking 1's operational record.

In particular, samples sought will include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[Water vapor|evaporation]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary cementation]] or [[hydrothermal activity]].\n* Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.\n* Determine what [[Geology of Mars|geologic processes]] have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.\n* Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey [[Geology of Mars|Martian geology]] from orbit.\n* Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.\n* Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and soils and determine the processes that created them.\n* Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present.\n* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.\n\nNASA sought evidence of life on Mars, beginning with the question of whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life forms known to science require water, so the history of [[water on Mars]] is a critical piece of knowledge.

It was the highest resolution image taken on the surface of another planet. According to the camera designer Jim Bell of [[Cornell University]], the panoramic mosaic consists of four pancam images high by three wide. The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 [[pixels]]. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [http://areo.info/mer/ colors outside the range of the human eye].)\n\nThe MER pancams are black-and-white instruments. Thirteen rotating filter wheels produce multiple images of the same scene at different wavelengths. Once received on Earth, these images can be combined to produce color images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424065044/http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|url-status=dead|title=MER color imagery, methods|archivedate=April 24, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==== Sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}} flash memory management anomaly ====\nOn January 21, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}}), ''Spirit'' abruptly ceased communicating with mission control. The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. ''Spirit'' was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via [[X band]] to ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating \u2013 risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\"Shutdown Dammit Until\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.\n\nThe leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \"reboot loop\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the [[flash memory]], the [[EEPROM]], or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set \u2013 enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.\n\nOn January 24, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|24}}) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with ''Spirit'''s flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \"not robust enough\" for the operations the ''Spirit'' was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|06}}), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.<ref name=\"planetary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719212649/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000702/ Planetary Blog].</ref>\n\n==== First intentional grinding of a rock on Mars ====\n[[File:Rat post grind.jpg|thumb|right|Digital camera (the [[Pancam]]) image of a Mars rock (called [[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]) taken after a [[Rock Abrasion Tool|RAT]] grind (the rock grinding tool)]]\nFor the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars, the ''Spirit'' team chose a rock called \"[[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]\".

Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], reported during a NASA press conference: \"If we found this rock on Earth, we would say it is a volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it.\" In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover ''Opportunity'', this one was formed from [[magma]] and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040305a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Bonneville crater ====\nOn sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|03|11}} March 11, 2004, ''Spirit'' reached [[Bonneville (crater)|Bonneville crater]] after a {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on|sp=us}} journey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This crater is about {{convert|200|m|yd|sp=us}} across with a floor about {{convert|10|m|yd|sp=us}} [[Crater depth|below]] the surface.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surfical geology of the Spirit rover traverse in Gusev Crater: dry and desiccating since the Hesperian |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2004/pdf/8055.pdf |conference=Second Conference on Early Mars (2004) |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |author=Golombek|page=1 |quote=The rim is ~{{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high and although the crater is shallow (~{{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} deep)|display-authors=etal}}</ref> JPL decided that it would be a bad idea to send the rover down into the crater, as they saw no targets of interest inside. ''Spirit'' drove along the southern rim and continued to the southwest towards the Columbia Hills.\n{{wide image|PIA05591 Spirit's Destination (panorama).jpg|800px|Bonneville Crater}}\n\n''Spirit'' reached Missoula crater on sol 105. The crater is roughly {{convert|100|yd|m|sp=us}} across and {{convert|20|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. Missoula crater was not considered a high priority target due to the older rocks it contained. The rover skirted the northern rim, and continued to the southeast.\nIt then reached Lahontan crater on sol 118, and drove along the rim until sol 120. Lahontan is about {{convert|60|yd|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. A long, snaking sand dune stretches away from its southwestern side, and ''Spirit'' went around it, because loose sand dunes present an unknown risk to the ability of the rover wheels to get traction.\n\n==== Columbia Hills ====\n''Spirit'' drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, ''Spirit'' reached the first of many targets at the base of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]] called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \"[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold]]\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the M\u00f6\u00dfbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-161 | title = Mars Rovers Surprises Continue | work = JPL website | accessdate = 2006-10-06}}</ref> This kind of rock can  be built in connection with water.\n\nAs the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2004.html#sol171|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.\n\nFrom here, ''Spirit'' took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, ''Spirit'' had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \"Clovis\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226\u2013235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281\u2013295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296\u2013303). From Sols 239 to 262, ''Spirit'' powered down for [[solar conjunction]], when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, ''Spirit'' made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \"Cumberland Ridge\" and into \"[[Larry's Lookout]]\" and \"Tennessee Valley\". ''Spirit'' also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter ''[[Mars Express]]'' though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]''.\n\n=== 2005 ===\n\n==== Driving up to Husband Hill ====\n''Spirit'' had now been on Mars for one Earth year and was driving slowly uphill towards the top of Husband Hill. This was difficult because there were many rocky obstacles and sandy parts. This lead frequently to a slippage and the route could not be driven as planned. In February ''Spirit'''s computer received a software update in order to drive more autonomously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol416|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> On sol 371, ''Spirit'' arrived at a rock named \"Peace\" near the top of Cumberland Ridge. ''Spirit'' ground ''Peace'' with the RAT on sol 373. By sol 390 (mid-February 2005), ''Spirit'' was advancing towards \"Larry's Lookout\", by driving up the hill in reverse. The scientists at this time were trying to conserve as much energy as possible for the climb.\n\n''Spirit'' also investigated some targets along the way, including the soil target, \"Paso Robles\", which contained the highest amount of salt found on the red planet. The soil also contained a high amount of [[phosphorus]] in its composition, however not nearly as high as another rock sampled by ''Spirit'', \"Wishstone\". Squyres said of the discovery, \"We're still trying to work out what this means, but clearly, with this much salt around, water had a hand here\".\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Pot of gold-Close-med.jpg|[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold rock]]\nImage:Gusev - Colina Husband.jpg|''Spirit'''s traverse up Husband Hill\nImage:Spirit PIA03230.jpg|''Spirit'' artificially added to image (taken by itself) of Larry's Lookout\nImage:MarsSunset.jpg|Martian sunset by ''Spirit'' at Gusev crater, May 19, 2005.\n</gallery>\n\n==== Dust devils ====\nOn March 9, 2005 (probably during the Martian night), the rover's solar panel efficiency jumped from the original ~60%  to 93%, followed on March 10, by the sighting of [[dust devils]]. NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending the duration of the mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by ''Spirit'' or ''Opportunity'', and is easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date. Dust devils had previously only been photographed by the ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe.\n\nMission members monitoring ''Spirit'' on Mars reported on March 12, 2005 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|03|12}}), that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the robot's solar panels. Energy levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded.<ref>{{cite web | last = David | first = Leonard | date = March 12, 2005 | url = http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spirit_dust_050312.html | title = Spirit Gets A Dust Devil Once-Over | publisher = Space.com | accessdate =December 1, 2006}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Marsdustdevil2.gif|thumb|center|800px|Video of a dust devil on Mars, photographed by ''Spirit''.

Here it was found that Husband Hill has two summits, with one a little higher than the other. On August 21 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|08|20}})<ref>{{cite web |title=Rover Update: 2005: All |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/rover-status/spirit/2005/all/#sol579 |website=mars.nasa.gov |accessdate=23 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>, ''Spirit'' reached the real summit of Husband Hill. The rover was the first spacecraft to climb atop a mountain on another planet. The whole distance driven totaled 4971 meters.\nThe summit itself was flat. ''Spirit'' took a 360 degree panorama in real color, which included the whole Gusev crater. At night the rover observed the moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] in order to determine their orbits better.<ref name=\"nasa_2010_189\">{{cite web \n|authors=Staff |title=NASA Rover Finds Clue to Mars' Past And Environment for Life |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20100603.html |work=[[NASA]] |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> On sol 656 ''Spirit'' surveyed the Mars sky and the opacity of the atmosphere with its pancam to make a coordinated science campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol655|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nFrom the peak ''Spirit'' spotted a striking formation, which was dubbed \"Home Plate\". This was an interesting target, but ''Spirit'' would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down ''Spirit'' reached the rock formation named \"Comanche\" on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers to find out that about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium iron carbonate. That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/comanche-no-label.html|title=NASA \u2013 Carbonate-Containing Martian Rocks (False Color)|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n{{Wide image|Everest Panorama from Mars.jpg|1100px|View from the Summit taken by ''Spirit'' on August 23, 2005, as the rover completed the climb up Husband Hill.}}\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n==== Driving to McCool Hill ====\nIn 2006 ''Spirit'' drove towards an area dubbed Home Plate, and reached it in February. For events in 2006 by NASA see [http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/status_spirit_2006.html NASA Spirit Archive 2006]\n\n''Spirit's'' next stop was originally planned to be the north face of [[McCool Hill]], where ''Spirit'' would receive adequate sunlight during the Martian winter. On March 16, 2006 JPL announced that ''Spirit's'' troublesome front wheel had stopped working altogether. Despite this, ''Spirit'' was still making progress toward McCool Hill because the control team programmed the rover to drive toward McCool Hill backwards, dragging its broken wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol778|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>  In late March, ''Spirit'' encountered loose soil that was impeding its progress toward McCool Hill. A decision was made to terminate attempts to reach McCool Hill and instead park on a nearby ridge named Low Ridge Haven.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Home plate anim.gif\n| width1    = {{#expr: (130 * 331 / 285 ) round 0}}\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Curious rock near edge of \"Home Plate\" with a jutting portion.

Scientific observations were conducted with ''Spirit's'' robotic arm.\n\n==== Low Ridge Haven ====\n[[File:PIA08576-Spirit Rover-Possible Meteorites at Low Ridge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Possible meteorites found at Low Ridge]]\nReaching the ridge on April 9, 2006 and parking on the ridge with an 11\u00b0 incline to the north, ''Spirit'' spent the next eight months on the ridge, spending that time undertaking observations of changes in the surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/missions/mer/mer-20060412.html|title=NASA \u2013 NASA Mars Rovers Head for New Sites After Studying Layers|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>  No drives were attempted because of the low energy levels the rover was experiencing during the Martian winter. The rover made its first drive, a short turn to position targets of interest within reach of the robotic arm, in early November 2006, following the shortest days of winter and solar conjunction when communications with Earth were severely limited.\n\nWhile at Low Ridge, ''Spirit'' imaged two rocks of similar chemical nature to that of ''Opportunity'''s [[Heat Shield Rock]], a [[meteorite]] on the surface of Mars. Named \"Zhong Shan\" for [[Sun Yat-sen]] and \"Allan Hills\" for the [[Allan Hills|location]] in [[Antarctica]] where several Martian meteorites have been found, they stood out against the background rocks that were darker. Further spectrographic testing is being done to determine the exact composition of these rocks, which may turn out to also be meteorites.\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n==== Software upgrade ====\nOn January 4, 2007 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2007|01|04}}), both rovers received new flight software to the onboard computers. The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/04/tech-mars.html | work=CBC News | title=Old rovers learn new tricks | date=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Silica Valley====\n[[File:Spirit Mars Silica April 20 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rover exposes silica-rich dust]]\n''Spirit'''s dead wheel turned out to have a silver lining. As it was traveling in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist [[Steve Squyres]]. \"We're really excited about this,\" he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]\u2013the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks  stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. \"The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same,\" Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which [[microbe]]s can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, \"You can go to [[hot spring]]s and you can go to [[fumarole]]s and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life \u2013 [[Microorganism|microbial life]].\"<ref name=\"Amos\">{{cite news  | last = Amos  | first = Jonathan    | title = Mars robot unearths microbe clue   | work = NASA says its robot rover Spirit has made one of its most significant discoveries on the surface of Mars. |publisher=BBC News  | date = December 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7137793.stm  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"20071210a\">{{cite web  | last = Bertster  | first =  Guy   | title = Mars Rover Investigates Signs of Steamy Martian Past  | work = Press Release  | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California  | date = December 10, 2007  | url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==== Global dust storm and Home Plate ====\nDuring 2007 ''Spirit'' spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau. On sol 1306 ''Spirit'' climbed onto the eastern edge of the plateau. In September and October it examined rocks and soils at several locations on the southern half of the plateau. On November 6, ''Spirit'' had reached the western edge of Home Plate, and started taking pictures for a panoramic overview of the western valley, with Grissom Hill and Husband Hill visible. The panorama image was published on NASA's website on January 3, 2008 to little attention, until January 23, when an independent website published a magnified detail of the image that showed a rock feature a few centimeters high resembling a humanoid figure seen from the side with its right arm partially raised.<ref>[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001305/ Planetary.org] Emily Lakdawalla, ''Teeny little Bigfoot on Mars'', January 23, 2008 | 12:41 PST | 20:41 UTC</ref><ref>{{Cite APOD |date=January 29, 2008 |title=Spirit's West Valley Panorama image |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Circular projection showing ''Spirit'''s solar panels covered in dust \u2013 October 2007]]\nTowards the end of June 2007, a series of dust storms began clouding the Martian atmosphere with dust. The storms intensified and by July 20, both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\".<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-080| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=NASA Mars Rovers Braving Severe Dust Storms| date=July 27, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to ''Opportunity'', and slightly more to ''Spirit''.\n\nNormally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to {{Convert|700|Wh}} of energy per [[Martian day]]. After the storms, the amount of energy generated was greatly reduced to {{Convert|128|Wh}}. If the rovers generate less than {{Convert|150|Wh}} per day they must start draining their batteries to run survival heaters. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries. They were kept in hibernation in order to wait out the remainder of the storm.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20070807a.html| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=Martian Skies Brighten Slightly| date=August 7, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref>\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n==== Hibernating ====\nThe main concern was the energy level for ''Spirit''. To increase the amount of light hitting the solar panels, the rover was parked in the northern part of Home Plate on as steep a slope as possible. It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named ''Bonestell'' was produced. At other times when there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2008.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Winter dust storm ====\nOn November 10, 2008, a large dust storm further reduced the output of the solar panels to {{Convert|89|Wh}} per day\u2014a critically low level.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20081110a.html |accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Dust Storm Cuts Energy Supply of NASA Mars Rover Spirit| date= November 10, 2008| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> NASA officials were hopeful that ''Spirit'' would survive the storm, and that the energy level would rise once the storm had passed and the skies started clearing.

It is also possible that the rover had experienced a mission clock fault. If that had happened, the rover would have lost track of time and tried to remain asleep until enough sunlight struck the solar arrays to wake it. This state is called \"Solar Groovy.\" If the rover woke up from a mission clock fault, it would only listen. Starting on July 26, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|07|26}}), a new procedure to address the possible mission clock fault was implemented.\n\nEach sol, the Deep Space Network mission controllers sent a set of X-band \"Sweep & Beep\" commands. If the rover had experienced a mission clock fault and then had been awoken during the day, it would have listened during brief, 20-minute intervals during each hour awake. Due to the possible clock fault, the timing of these 20-minute listening intervals was not known, so multiple \"Sweep & Beep\" commands were sent. If the rover heard one of these commands, it would have responded with an X-band beep signal, updating the mission controllers on its status and allowing them to investigate the state of the rover further.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.\n\n==Astronomy==\n{{see also|Astronomy on Mars}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = PIA05547-Spirit Rover-Earth seen from Mars.png\n| width1 = {{#expr: (200 * (1194 / 1007)) round 0}}\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Earth]] from Mars\n| image2 = Phobos & Deimos full thumb.png\n| width2 = {{#expr: (200 * (200 / 213)) round 0}}\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Night sky of Mars showing [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] (left) and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] (right) in front of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], as seen by [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''Spirit'' on August 26, 2005.

It also took the first photo of Earth from the surface of another planet in early March 2004.\n\nIn late 2005, ''Spirit'' took advantage of a favorable energy situation to make multiple nighttime observations of both of Mars' moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]].<ref name=\"pancam\">Jim Bell (Cornell University) et al. [http://pancam.astro.cornell.edu/pancam_instrument/projects_2.html Pancam Projects: Spirit Night-time Imaging]. Retrieved 2008-10-21</ref> These observations included a \"[[lunar eclipse|lunar]]\" (or rather phobian) [[eclipse]] as ''Spirit'' watched Phobos disappear into Mars' shadow. Some of ''Spirit'''s star gazing was designed to look for a predicted [[meteor shower]] caused by [[Halley's Comet]], and although at least four imaged streaks were suspect meteors, they could not be unambiguously differentiated from those caused by cosmic rays.<ref name=\"pancam\" />\n\nA [[transit of Mercury from Mars]] took place on January 12, 2005 from about 14:45 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] to 23:05 UTC. Theoretically, this could have been observed by both ''Spirit'' and ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]''; however, camera resolution did not permit seeing Mercury's [[Arc second|6.1\"]] angular diameter. They were able to observe transits of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] across the Sun, but at [[Arc minute|2']] angular diameter, Deimos is about 20 times larger than Mercury's 6.1\" angular diameter. Ephemeris data generated by [[JPL Horizons]] indicates that ''Opportunity'' would have been able to observe the transit from the start until local sunset at about 19:23 UTC Earth time, while ''Spirit'' would have been able to observe it from local sunrise at about 19:38 UTC until the end of the transit.{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}<!-- the nasa.gov URL does not state any of this; need instructions on how to verify this --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons|title=HORIZONS System|first=Alan|last=Chamberlin|website=ssd.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment wear and failures==\nBoth rovers passed their original mission time of 90 sols many times over. The extended time on the surface, and therefore additional stress on components, resulted in some issues developing.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nOn March 13, 2006 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2006|03|13}}), the right front wheel ceased working<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-b.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm/images.cfm?id=1906|title=JPL.NASA.GOV: Mars Exploration Rovers|website=www-b.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> after having covered {{Convert|4.2|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} on Mars. Engineers began driving the rover backwards, dragging the dead wheel. Although this resulted in changes to driving techniques, the dragging effect became a useful tool, partially clearing away soil on the surface as the rover traveled, thus allowing areas to be imaged that would normally be inaccessible. However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth. On November 29, 2009 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2009|11|29}}), the right rear wheel also stalled and remained inoperable for the remainder of the mission.\n\nScientific instruments also experienced degradation as a result of exposure to the harsh Martian environment and use over a far longer period than had been anticipated by the mission planners. Over time, the diamond in the resin grinding surface of the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] wore down, after that the device could only be used to brush targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/rover/Roverextension.html|title=NASA\u02bcs Mars rovers and Steve Squyres keep going and going \u2013 Cornell Chronicle|website=www.news.cornell.edu}}</ref> All of the other science instruments and engineering cameras continued to function until contact was lost; however, towards the end of ''Spirit'''s life, the [[MIMOS II]] [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometer]] took much longer to produce results than it did earlier in the mission because of the decay of its [[cobalt]]-57 gamma ray source that has a half life of 271 days.\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:MarsSunsetCut.jpg|thumb|right|Martian sunset in 2005 by ''Spirit'']]\n\n===To rover===\nTo commemorate ''Spirit'''s great contribution to the [[exploration of Mars]], the [[asteroid]]  [[37452 Spirit]] has been named after it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/spotlight/20041011.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Spotlight|website=marsrovers.nasa.gov}}</ref> The name was proposed by [[Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld]] who along with [[Cornelis Johannes van Houten]] and [[Tom Gehrels]] discovered the asteroid on September 24, 1960.\n\n[[Reuben H.

The mission received several extensions and lasted about 2,208 sols. On August 11, 2007, ''Spirit'' obtained the second longest operational duration on the surface of Mars for a lander or rover at 1282 Sols, one sol longer than the [[Viking 2]] lander. Viking 2 was powered by a nuclear cell whereas ''Spirit'' is powered by solar arrays. Until ''Opportunity'' overtook it on May 19, 2010, the Mars probe with longest operational period was [[Viking 1]] that lasted for 2245 Sols on the surface of Mars. On March 22, 2010, ''Spirit'' sent its last communication, thus falling just over a month short of surpassing Viking 1's operational record.

In particular, samples sought will include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[Water vapor|evaporation]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary cementation]] or [[hydrothermal activity]].\n* Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.\n* Determine what [[Geology of Mars|geologic processes]] have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.\n* Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey [[Geology of Mars|Martian geology]] from orbit.\n* Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.\n* Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and soils and determine the processes that created them.\n* Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present.\n* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.\n\nNASA sought evidence of life on Mars, beginning with the question of whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life forms known to science require water, so the history of [[water on Mars]] is a critical piece of knowledge. Although the Mars Exploration Rovers did not have the ability to detect life directly, they offered very important information on the habitability of the environment during the planet's history.\n\n==Design and construction==\n\n[[File:Mars Exploration Rover.jpg|thumb|right|Annotated rover diagram]]\n[[File:MER Spirit Lander Pan Sol16-A18R1 br2.jpg|thumb|right|''Spirit'' rover images its lander on the surface of Mars on January 18/19, 2004 (''Spirit'' Sol 16)<ref>[http://marsrover.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20040121a.html NASA.gov], MER-A 20040121a</ref>]]\n[[File:Spirit rock abrasion tool.jpg|thumb|The piece of metal with the American flag on Spirit's rock abrasion tool is made of aluminum recovered from the site of the World Trade Center towers.]]\n{{main|Mars Exploration Rover}}\n{{see also|Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers}}\n\n''Spirit'' (and its twin, ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'') are six-wheeled, [[solar panel|solar-powered]] robots standing {{convert|1.5|m|ft|sp=us}} high, {{convert|2.3|m|ft|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighing {{convert|180|kg|lb}}.

It was the highest resolution image taken on the surface of another planet. According to the camera designer Jim Bell of [[Cornell University]], the panoramic mosaic consists of four pancam images high by three wide. The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 [[pixels]]. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [http://areo.info/mer/ colors outside the range of the human eye].)\n\nThe MER pancams are black-and-white instruments. Thirteen rotating filter wheels produce multiple images of the same scene at different wavelengths. Once received on Earth, these images can be combined to produce color images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424065044/http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|url-status=dead|title=MER color imagery, methods|archivedate=April 24, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==== Sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}} flash memory management anomaly ====\nOn January 21, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}}), ''Spirit'' abruptly ceased communicating with mission control. The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. ''Spirit'' was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via [[X band]] to ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating \u2013 risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\"Shutdown Dammit Until\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.\n\nThe leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \"reboot loop\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the [[flash memory]], the [[EEPROM]], or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set \u2013 enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.\n\nOn January 24, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|24}}) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with ''Spirit'''s flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \"not robust enough\" for the operations the ''Spirit'' was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|06}}), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.<ref name=\"planetary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719212649/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000702/ Planetary Blog].</ref>\n\n==== First intentional grinding of a rock on Mars ====\n[[File:Rat post grind.jpg|thumb|right|Digital camera (the [[Pancam]]) image of a Mars rock (called [[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]) taken after a [[Rock Abrasion Tool|RAT]] grind (the rock grinding tool)]]\nFor the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars, the ''Spirit'' team chose a rock called \"[[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]\". To make the drive there, the rover turned 40 degrees in short arcs totaling {{convert|95|cm}}. It then turned in place to face the target rock and drove four short moves straightforward totaling {{cvt|1.9|m}}. Adirondack was chosen over another rock called \"Sashimi\", which was closer to the rover, as Adirondack's surface was smoother, making it more suitable for the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (aka \"RAT\").<ref>{{cite press release |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=January 19, 2004 |title=Spirit Drives to a Rock Called 'Adirondack' for Close Inspection |url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040119a.html |publisher=NASA |access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref>\n\n''Spirit'' made a small depression in the rock, {{convert|45.5|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|2.65|mm}} deep.

Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], reported during a NASA press conference: \"If we found this rock on Earth, we would say it is a volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it.\" In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover ''Opportunity'', this one was formed from [[magma]] and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040305a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Bonneville crater ====\nOn sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|03|11}} March 11, 2004, ''Spirit'' reached [[Bonneville (crater)|Bonneville crater]] after a {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on|sp=us}} journey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This crater is about {{convert|200|m|yd|sp=us}} across with a floor about {{convert|10|m|yd|sp=us}} [[Crater depth|below]] the surface.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surfical geology of the Spirit rover traverse in Gusev Crater: dry and desiccating since the Hesperian |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2004/pdf/8055.pdf |conference=Second Conference on Early Mars (2004) |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |author=Golombek|page=1 |quote=The rim is ~{{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high and although the crater is shallow (~{{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} deep)|display-authors=etal}}</ref> JPL decided that it would be a bad idea to send the rover down into the crater, as they saw no targets of interest inside. ''Spirit'' drove along the southern rim and continued to the southwest towards the Columbia Hills.\n{{wide image|PIA05591 Spirit's Destination (panorama).jpg|800px|Bonneville Crater}}\n\n''Spirit'' reached Missoula crater on sol 105. The crater is roughly {{convert|100|yd|m|sp=us}} across and {{convert|20|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. Missoula crater was not considered a high priority target due to the older rocks it contained. The rover skirted the northern rim, and continued to the southeast.\nIt then reached Lahontan crater on sol 118, and drove along the rim until sol 120. Lahontan is about {{convert|60|yd|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. A long, snaking sand dune stretches away from its southwestern side, and ''Spirit'' went around it, because loose sand dunes present an unknown risk to the ability of the rover wheels to get traction.\n\n==== Columbia Hills ====\n''Spirit'' drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, ''Spirit'' reached the first of many targets at the base of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]] called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \"[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold]]\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the M\u00f6\u00dfbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-161 | title = Mars Rovers Surprises Continue | work = JPL website | accessdate = 2006-10-06}}</ref> This kind of rock can  be built in connection with water.\n\nAs the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2004.html#sol171|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.\n\nFrom here, ''Spirit'' took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, ''Spirit'' had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \"Clovis\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226\u2013235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281\u2013295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296\u2013303). From Sols 239 to 262, ''Spirit'' powered down for [[solar conjunction]], when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, ''Spirit'' made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \"Cumberland Ridge\" and into \"[[Larry's Lookout]]\" and \"Tennessee Valley\". ''Spirit'' also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter ''[[Mars Express]]'' though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]''.\n\n=== 2005 ===\n\n==== Driving up to Husband Hill ====\n''Spirit'' had now been on Mars for one Earth year and was driving slowly uphill towards the top of Husband Hill. This was difficult because there were many rocky obstacles and sandy parts. This lead frequently to a slippage and the route could not be driven as planned. In February ''Spirit'''s computer received a software update in order to drive more autonomously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol416|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> On sol 371, ''Spirit'' arrived at a rock named \"Peace\" near the top of Cumberland Ridge. ''Spirit'' ground ''Peace'' with the RAT on sol 373. By sol 390 (mid-February 2005), ''Spirit'' was advancing towards \"Larry's Lookout\", by driving up the hill in reverse. The scientists at this time were trying to conserve as much energy as possible for the climb.\n\n''Spirit'' also investigated some targets along the way, including the soil target, \"Paso Robles\", which contained the highest amount of salt found on the red planet. The soil also contained a high amount of [[phosphorus]] in its composition, however not nearly as high as another rock sampled by ''Spirit'', \"Wishstone\". Squyres said of the discovery, \"We're still trying to work out what this means, but clearly, with this much salt around, water had a hand here\".\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Pot of gold-Close-med.jpg|[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold rock]]\nImage:Gusev - Colina Husband.jpg|''Spirit'''s traverse up Husband Hill\nImage:Spirit PIA03230.jpg|''Spirit'' artificially added to image (taken by itself) of Larry's Lookout\nImage:MarsSunset.jpg|Martian sunset by ''Spirit'' at Gusev crater, May 19, 2005.\n</gallery>\n\n==== Dust devils ====\nOn March 9, 2005 (probably during the Martian night), the rover's solar panel efficiency jumped from the original ~60%  to 93%, followed on March 10, by the sighting of [[dust devils]]. NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending the duration of the mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by ''Spirit'' or ''Opportunity'', and is easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date. Dust devils had previously only been photographed by the ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe.\n\nMission members monitoring ''Spirit'' on Mars reported on March 12, 2005 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|03|12}}), that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the robot's solar panels. Energy levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded.<ref>{{cite web | last = David | first = Leonard | date = March 12, 2005 | url = http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spirit_dust_050312.html | title = Spirit Gets A Dust Devil Once-Over | publisher = Space.com | accessdate =December 1, 2006}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Marsdustdevil2.gif|thumb|center|800px|Video of a dust devil on Mars, photographed by ''Spirit''.

This was an interesting target, but ''Spirit'' would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down ''Spirit'' reached the rock formation named \"Comanche\" on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers to find out that about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium iron carbonate. That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/comanche-no-label.html|title=NASA \u2013 Carbonate-Containing Martian Rocks (False Color)|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n{{Wide image|Everest Panorama from Mars.jpg|1100px|View from the Summit taken by ''Spirit'' on August 23, 2005, as the rover completed the climb up Husband Hill.}}\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n==== Driving to McCool Hill ====\nIn 2006 ''Spirit'' drove towards an area dubbed Home Plate, and reached it in February.

On March 16, 2006 JPL announced that ''Spirit's'' troublesome front wheel had stopped working altogether. Despite this, ''Spirit'' was still making progress toward McCool Hill because the control team programmed the rover to drive toward McCool Hill backwards, dragging its broken wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol778|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>  In late March, ''Spirit'' encountered loose soil that was impeding its progress toward McCool Hill.

The rover made its first drive, a short turn to position targets of interest within reach of the robotic arm, in early November 2006, following the shortest days of winter and solar conjunction when communications with Earth were severely limited.\n\nWhile at Low Ridge, ''Spirit'' imaged two rocks of similar chemical nature to that of ''Opportunity'''s [[Heat Shield Rock]], a [[meteorite]] on the surface of Mars. Named \"Zhong Shan\" for [[Sun Yat-sen]] and \"Allan Hills\" for the [[Allan Hills|location]] in [[Antarctica]] where several Martian meteorites have been found, they stood out against the background rocks that were darker. Further spectrographic testing is being done to determine the exact composition of these rocks, which may turn out to also be meteorites.\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n==== Software upgrade ====\nOn January 4, 2007 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2007|01|04}}), both rovers received new flight software to the onboard computers. The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/04/tech-mars.html | work=CBC News | title=Old rovers learn new tricks | date=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Silica Valley====\n[[File:Spirit Mars Silica April 20 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rover exposes silica-rich dust]]\n''Spirit'''s dead wheel turned out to have a silver lining. As it was traveling in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist [[Steve Squyres]]. \"We're really excited about this,\" he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]\u2013the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks  stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. \"The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same,\" Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which [[microbe]]s can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, \"You can go to [[hot spring]]s and you can go to [[fumarole]]s and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life \u2013 [[Microorganism|microbial life]].\"<ref name=\"Amos\">{{cite news  | last = Amos  | first = Jonathan    | title = Mars robot unearths microbe clue   | work = NASA says its robot rover Spirit has made one of its most significant discoveries on the surface of Mars. |publisher=BBC News  | date = December 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7137793.stm  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"20071210a\">{{cite web  | last = Bertster  | first =  Guy   | title = Mars Rover Investigates Signs of Steamy Martian Past  | work = Press Release  | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California  | date = December 10, 2007  | url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==== Global dust storm and Home Plate ====\nDuring 2007 ''Spirit'' spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau. On sol 1306 ''Spirit'' climbed onto the eastern edge of the plateau. In September and October it examined rocks and soils at several locations on the southern half of the plateau. On November 6, ''Spirit'' had reached the western edge of Home Plate, and started taking pictures for a panoramic overview of the western valley, with Grissom Hill and Husband Hill visible. The panorama image was published on NASA's website on January 3, 2008 to little attention, until January 23, when an independent website published a magnified detail of the image that showed a rock feature a few centimeters high resembling a humanoid figure seen from the side with its right arm partially raised.<ref>[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001305/ Planetary.org] Emily Lakdawalla, ''Teeny little Bigfoot on Mars'', January 23, 2008 | 12:41 PST | 20:41 UTC</ref><ref>{{Cite APOD |date=January 29, 2008 |title=Spirit's West Valley Panorama image |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Circular projection showing ''Spirit'''s solar panels covered in dust \u2013 October 2007]]\nTowards the end of June 2007, a series of dust storms began clouding the Martian atmosphere with dust. The storms intensified and by July 20, both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\".<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-080| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=NASA Mars Rovers Braving Severe Dust Storms| date=July 27, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to ''Opportunity'', and slightly more to ''Spirit''.\n\nNormally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to {{Convert|700|Wh}} of energy per [[Martian day]]. After the storms, the amount of energy generated was greatly reduced to {{Convert|128|Wh}}. If the rovers generate less than {{Convert|150|Wh}} per day they must start draining their batteries to run survival heaters. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries. They were kept in hibernation in order to wait out the remainder of the storm.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20070807a.html| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=Martian Skies Brighten Slightly| date=August 7, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref>\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n==== Hibernating ====\nThe main concern was the energy level for ''Spirit''. To increase the amount of light hitting the solar panels, the rover was parked in the northern part of Home Plate on as steep a slope as possible. It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named ''Bonestell'' was produced. At other times when there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2008.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Winter dust storm ====\nOn November 10, 2008, a large dust storm further reduced the output of the solar panels to {{Convert|89|Wh}} per day\u2014a critically low level.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20081110a.html |accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Dust Storm Cuts Energy Supply of NASA Mars Rover Spirit| date= November 10, 2008| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> NASA officials were hopeful that ''Spirit'' would survive the storm, and that the energy level would rise once the storm had passed and the skies started clearing.

If the rover had experienced a mission clock fault and then had been awoken during the day, it would have listened during brief, 20-minute intervals during each hour awake. Due to the possible clock fault, the timing of these 20-minute listening intervals was not known, so multiple \"Sweep & Beep\" commands were sent.

Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form. \nWishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and [[anhydrate]] (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed [[sulfur]] and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.\nOne type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], and iron.<ref name=\"Ming2005JE002560\" />\nAlso, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe<sup>3+</sup> form, which would happen if water had been present.<ref name=\"Bell\" />\n\nTowards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure [[silica]] were found in the soil.<ref name=\"Sky & Telescope\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/19177609.html|title=Mars Rover Uncovers Ancient Hot Springs|publisher=SkyandTelescope.com|date=2008-05-22|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html|title=NASA \u2013 Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Spirit'' stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or [[Mini-TES]] and confirmed the presence of large amounts of [[carbonate]]-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.\n\n==Astronomy==\n{{see also|Astronomy on Mars}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = PIA05547-Spirit Rover-Earth seen from Mars.png\n| width1 = {{#expr: (200 * (1194 / 1007)) round 0}}\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Earth]] from Mars\n| image2 = Phobos & Deimos full thumb.png\n| width2 = {{#expr: (200 * (200 / 213)) round 0}}\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Night sky of Mars showing [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] (left) and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] (right) in front of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], as seen by [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''Spirit'' on August 26, 2005.

However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth.

Its population was 4,414,681 at the 2010 census and its urban area is home to 2,146,980 inhabitants, including three urban districts, currently in the agglomeration.\n\nHistorically, Yangzhou was one of the wealthiest cities in China, known at various periods for its great merchant families, poets, artists, and scholars. Its name (<small>lit.</small> \"Rising Prefecture\") refers to its former position as the capital of the ancient [[Yangzhou (ancient China)|Yangzhou]] prefecture in [[History of the administrative divisions of China before 1912|imperial China]].

After the defeat of [[Yue (state)|Yue]] by [[King Fuchai of Wu]], a garrison city was built {{Convert|12|m|abbr=on}} above the water level on the north bank of the Yangtze c.&nbsp;485&nbsp;BC.  This city in the shape of a three by three ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' square was named Hancheng.<ref>Schinz, 1996</ref> The newly built Han canal formed a moat around the south and east sides of the city. The purpose of Hancheng was to protect [[Suzhou]] from naval invasion from [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. During the [[Han dynasty]], Guangling was the seat of [[Guangling Commandery]]. It constituted a part of the [[Xu Province]], rather than the [[Yang Province]] (Yangzhou), which was covered the entire southeastern part of China then. In 590, the city was made the capital of a newly established [[Yang Prefecture (Jiangsu)|Yang Prefecture]], and began to be referred to with its current name.\n\nUnder [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] (r. 604\u2013617), Yangzhou was the southern capital of China. It was called Jiangdu upon the completion of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] until the fall of the [[Sui dynasty]]. By the mid 610s, a combination of fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, together with natural disasters and provincial unrest, ensured many people Emperor Yang had lost the legitimacy of his monarchy. As revolts spread across China in 616, the Emperor abandoned the North and meanwhile withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.\n\n===Tang Dynasty===\nThe city has remained a leading economic and cultural center and major port of foreign trade and external exchange since the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907). Many Arab and Persian merchants lived in the city in the 7th century, but they were massacred in the thousands in 760 during the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] by Tian Shengong's ({{zh|s=\u7530\u795e\u529f|hp=Ti\u00e1n Sh\u00e9ng\u014dng|w=T'ien Shen-kung|links=no}}) rebel insurgents during the [[Yangzhou massacre (760)]].<ref name=\"Perkins\">{{Cite book|last=Perkins|first=Dorothy|title=Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture|publisher=Roundtable Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8160-4374-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|accessdate=2012-01-10|quote=Probably by the 7th century Persians had joined with Arabs to create the foreign emporium on the Grand Canal at Yangchou mentioned by the New T'ang History.

As early as 1655, the Dutch envoy [[Johan Nieuhof]] described the city (''Jamcefu'', i.e. Yangzhou-Fu, in his transcription) commented on the city's salt trade as follows:<ref>[[Johan Nieuhof]],\n''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=turn&entity=DLDecArts.Nieuhof.p0108 An embassy from the East-India Company of the United Provinces, to the Grand Tartar Cham, emperor of China: delivered by their excellencies Peter de Goyer and Jacob de Keyzer, at his imperial city of Peking wherein the cities, towns, villages, ports, rivers, &c. in their passages from Canton to Peking are ingeniously described by John Nieuhoff; ...

The riot that resulted was an angry crowd estimated at eight to ten thousand who assaulted the premises of the British [[OMF International|China Inland Mission]] in Yangzhou by looting, burning and attacking the missionaries led by [[Hudson Taylor]]. No one was killed, however several of the missionaries were injured as they were forced to flee for their lives. As a result of the report of the riot, the British consul in [[Shanghai]], [[Walter Henry Medhurst (consul)|Sir Walter Henry Medhurst]] took seventy [[Royal Marines]] in a [[man-of-war]] and steamed up the Yangtze to Nanjing in a controversial show of force that eventually resulted in an official apology from [[Viceroy]] [[Zeng Guofan]] and financial restitution made to the injured missionaries.\n\nFrom the time of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1853) to the beginning of the Reform Era (1980) Yangzhou was in decline, due to war damage, neglect of the Grand Canal as railways replaced it in importance, and stagnation in the early decades of the PRC. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], it endured eight years of enemy occupation and was used by the Japanese as a site for internment camps. About 1200 civilians of Allied nationalities (mostly British and Australian) from Shanghai were transported here in 1943, and located in one of three camps (A, B, and C). Camps B and C were closed down in September, 1943, after the second American-Japanese prisoner exchange, and their inhabitants transferred back to Shanghai camps.  Camp C, located in the former American Mission in the north-west of the city, was maintained for the duration of the war.<ref>Leck, Greg, ''Captives of Empire: The Japanese Internment of Allied Civilians in China'' Shandy Press, 2006; Antonia Finnane, ''Far From Where?

The city's status as a leading economic centre in China was never to be restored. Not until the 1990s did it begin to regain some semblance of prosperity, benefitting from national economic growth and a number of targeted development projects. With the canal now partially restored, and excellent rail and road connections, Yangzhou is once again an important transportation and market center. It also has some industrial output, chiefly in cotton and textiles. In 2004, a railway linked Yangzhou for the first time with Nanjing.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Yangzhou five pavilion bridge.JPG|thumb|250px|The Five Pavilion Bridge over Shouxi Lake.]]\nYangzhou is located on a plain north of the Yangtze. The Grand Canal, also known as the [[Beijing|Jing]]-[[Hangzhou|Hang]] Canal, crosses the prefecture-level from the north to the south; its modern route passes through the eastern outskirts of Yangzhou's main urban area, while its old route runs through the city center. Other major bodies of water within the prefecture-level city include the [[Baoshe River]], [[Datong River]], [[Beichengzi River]], [[Tongyang Canal]], [[Xintongyang Canal]], [[Baima Lake]], [[Baoying Lake]], [[Gaoyou Lake]] and [[Shaobo Lake]].\n\nLike much of the entire prefecture-level city, Yangzhou's main urban area (the \"city proper\") is criss-crossed by an intricate network of canals and small lakes. The historic city center (the former waled city) is surrounded by canals on all sides: the Old Grand Canal forms its eastern and southern boundaries; the City Moat Canal runs along the former walled city's northern edge, connecting the Old Grand Canal with the [[Slender West Lake]]; the Erdaohe Canal runs along the old city's western edge, from the Slender West Lake to the [[Hehuachi Park|Lotus Flower Pond]] (Hehuachi), which in its turn is connected by the short Erdaogou canal with the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://yangzhou.yztm.net/tnewsshow.asp?id=450 \u53e4\u8fd0\u6cb3\u2014\u8377\u82b1\u6c60\u2014\u7626\u897f\u6e56\u6c34\u4e0a\u6e38\u89c8\u7ebf\u5168\u90e8\u8d2f\u901a] (The Old Grand Canal \u2013 Hehua Pond \u2013 Thin West Lake tourist waterway is fully open), 2010-09-20</ref> It is possible to sail a small water craft from the Thin West Lake, via the Erdaohe, the Hehua Pond, and the Erdaogou into the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://www.yzcn.net/broadcast/pic/2011/0329/124850.shtml \u7eff\u6768\u57ce\u90ed\u6c34\u4e0a\u6e384\u00b718\u4eae\u76f8], 2011-3-29; see the map in this article</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nYangzhou has a subtropical monsoon climate with humid changeable wind; longer winters for about 4 months, summers 3 months and shorter springs and autumns, 2 months respectively; frost-free period of 222 days and annual average sunshine of 2177 hours.\n\nThe mean annual temperature is {{convert|15.72|\u00b0C|1}} annually; the normal monthly mean 24-hour temperature ranges from {{convert|2.5|\u00b0C}} in January to {{convert|28.0|\u00b0C}} in July.\n\nThe annual average precipitation is {{convert|1043|mm|abbr=on}}, and about 45 percent of rainfall is concentrated in the summer.

The average water depth is 15\u201320 meters. In 1992, the State Council approved it to become a first-grade open state harbour, and General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] inscribed its name. Now, it has developed into a comprehensive [[inland harbor]], integrating passenger, freight, container transportation and harbour trade, and has become the main distribution center of northern Jiangsu province, eastern [[Anhui]] Province and southeast [[Shandong]] Province. There are several dozen categories of goods including iron and steel, timber, minerals, coal, grain, cotton, container, products of light industry and machinery. The passenger routes reach Nanjing, Wuhu, [[Jiujiang]], [[Huangshi]] and [[Wuhan]] in the west, and [[Nantong]] and [[Shanghai]] in the east. Some well-known luxury international liners also anchor here. The harbour has greatly promoted the development of exports and the overall local economy.\n\n===Expressways===\n\nThe Ningyang (Nanjing\u2013Yangzhou) Expressway crosses the southern part of Yangzhou's metropolitan area while the Ningtong (Nanjing\u2013Nantong) Expressway is connected to Yangzhou at Liaojiagou. In recent years, local government have attached great importance to the development of the tourism, in conjunction with a greater effort dedicated to the improvement of the local road transport system. With a total investment of 680 million yuan, the Yangzhou section of the Ningyang Expressway was completed on December 18, 1998 and opened to traffic in June 1999. Stretching nearly {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}}, the section of the expressway starts from the Bazi Flyover as the entry/exit, via the Yanggua Highway, the Tonggang Highway, an ancient canal, the Yangwei Highway, the Beijing\u2013Hangzhou Grand Canal and the Yangling Highway, to Liqojiagou Entry/Exit of Yangjiang Highway. It then passes the Jiangdu Flyover to directly link up with the Huaijiang Expressway. In addition, the section of Huaijiang Expressway within the territory of Yangzhou began construction on March 22, 1997, which will be commonly used by the state planned Tongjiang\u2013Sanya and Beijing\u2013Shanghai trunk lines. The section of Huaijiang Expressway in Yangzhou totals {{convert|112.04|km|abbr=on}}in length, starting from Jinghe Town of Baoying in the north to the entry/exist of Zhuanqiaozhen Flyover of Jiangdu in the south. It then links with Ningtong Expressway, passing by three counties (cities) such as Baoying, Gaoyou and Jiangdu and 26 towns, at a total cost of 3.7 billion yuan. It is expected to be open to traffic by the year 2000.\n[[File:Yangzhou-Modern-Grand-Canal-barge-caravan-3342.JPG|thumb|The modern route of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] passes within a few kilometers east of the city's main urban area]]\n\n===Intercity bus service===\nDuring the daytime, frequent bus service operates between Yangzhou and nearby cities. There are several bus stations on the city's outskirts; most of the buses from [[Nanjing]] (Nanjing West Bus Station) and Zhenjiang (where the bus station is adjacent to the [[Zhenjiang Railway Station]]) arrive to Yangzhou South Bus Station, located a few kilometers southwest from downtown. Most of the intercity bus service stops in the early evening.\n\n===Transportation in the Urban Area===\nThe city is served by an extensive network of public bus routes.\n\nYangzhou's taxi industry began in 1982, and has developed rapidly since 1993. the city has over 40 taxi companies of various ownership structures, with a total of 1,571 vehicles. Parking lots were established at key stations and hotels, and eight taxi companies have opened round-the-clock telephone service. The construction department of the municipal government has strengthened the management of taxi services, providing education in the relevant laws, professional ethics and safety aspects.\n\nIn 2014, Yangzhou's government approved plans for the construction of a subway system, which will initially include two lines. Line 1 will run in the general east-west direction, from Yangzhou Railway Station in the west to the historic central city to the future high-speed railway station (east of the Grand Canal) to [[Jiangdu District]]. Line 2 will run in the general north-south direction.<ref>[http://www.yznews.com.cn/09zjyz/jr/2014-06/06/content_5228300.htm \u626c\u5dde\u5730 1\u30012\u53f7\u7ebf\u8d70\u5411\u521d\u5b9a], 2014-06-06</ref>\n\n===Tourist Transportation===\n\nTo develop tourism in Yangzhou, sightseeing buses have been introduced in the city run by the Tianma travel agency under the Yangzhou Tourist Bureau. There is a tour guide on each bus. The route, starting from Yangzhou station, has eight stops, and passes by such scenic spots of the Slender West Lake, Daming Temple, Imperial Dock, Siwang Pagoda, Wenchang Pagoda and Shita Temple. Yangzhou Public Transit also operates No.1, No.5 and No.2 special tourist lines. No.1 bus departs from the bus station and goes by the Slender West Lake, Shigong Temple, Geyuan Garden and Heyuan Garden; No.5 bus starts from the bus station and goes by the Crane Temple, Wenchang Pagoda, Slender West Lake, Five-Pavilion Bridge, and Pingshan Hall. A sight-seeing route on Slender West Lake has opened, connecting Imperial Dock, Yichun Garden, Hong Garden, Dahong Bridge, Xiaojinshan, Diaoyutai, Five-Pavilion Bridge, and the 24-bridge, finally reaching Daming Temple and Pingshan Hall.<ref>[http://www.tourochina.com/guide/Yangzhou/transportation-index.html]</ref>\n\n==Industries and Shipyards==\nYangzhhou is the site of Chengxi shipyard, large shipyard where bulk carriers and other types of large ships are built.<ref>{{cite web |title=CSSC Official website |url=http://www.cssc.net.cn/en/ |website=cssc.net.cn |publisher=CSSC |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shipyards in Jiangsu China |url=https://www.shipyards.gr/shipyards/search-by/state?value=Jiangsu |website=shipyards.gr |publisher=Shipyard directory |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> Owned partly by the state owned [[CSSC]] holdings, through Jiangsu Xinrong shipyard, Chengxi Yangzhou shipyard builds ships from 25,000 dwt to 170,000 dwt in size.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chengxi Xinrong shipyard |url=https://www.shipyards.gr/shipyards/ship-repair-shipyards/Shiprepairs-fareast-pacific-ocean/Shiprepairs-fareast-china-sea/chengxi-shipyard-xinrong-china |website=shipyards.gr |publisher=Shipyard directory |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jiangsu Chengxi shipyard |url=http://www.cccme.org.cn/shop/cccme2164/introduction.aspx |website=cccme.org.cn |publisher=Official website CCCME |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Chengxi shipyard Jiangsu |url=https://ecmarine.com/jiangyin.html |website=ecmarine.com |publisher=East coast marine alliance |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=China's white listed shipyards |url=https://www.tradewindsnews.com/incoming/article362564.ece5 |accessdate=6 December 2018 |publisher=Trade Winds}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Our expereince |url=http://tymvios.digital/projects/shipyard-experience/ |website=tymvios.digital |publisher=Shulte marine concepts |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nYangzhou dishes may be one of the reasons why the people of Yangzhou are so infatuated with their city. They have an appealing color, aroma, taste and appearance. The original color of each ingredient is preserved after cooking, and no oily sauce is added, so as to retain the fresh flavour of the food.\n\nIn Yangzhou all dishes, whether cheap or expensive, are elaborate. Cooks will not scrimp on their work, even with [[dazhu gansi]] ({{zh|c=\u5927\u716e\u5e72\u4e1d|p=d\u00e0zh\u01d4 g\u0101ns\u012b}}), a popular dish that costs only a few yuan. Dry bean curd is made by each restaurant that serves it, so the flavor is guaranteed. The cook slices the 1-cm-thick curd into 30 shreds, each one paper-thin but none broken, and then stews them for hours with chopped bamboo shoots and shelled shrimps in chicken soup. In this way the dry bean curd shreds can soak up the flavor of the other ingredients, and the soup is clear but savory. Not only Yangzhou cooks, but also the ordinary people are conscientious about cooking.\n\n* [[Fu Chun Teahouse]]\n* [[Yangzhou fried rice]], is said {{by whom|date=May 2014}} to have been invented by a person who was a former Yangzhou [[magistrate]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Yangzhou-childrens-library-scooter-parking-3411.jpg|thumb|Children's Library building, on the premises of Yangzhou Public Library]]\nThe Yangzhou dialect ({{zh|c=\u626c\u5dde\u8bdd|p=Y\u00e1ngzh\u014du hu\u00e0|links=no}}) of Chinese is representative of [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]], and is particularly close to the [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|official language]] of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] courts, which was based on the [[Nanjing dialect]]. However, it does differ considerably from modern [[Standard Chinese]], although they are still moderately [[mutually intelligible]].\n\nDialect has also been used as a tool for regional identity and politics in the [[Jiangbei region|Jiangbei]] and [[Jiangnan]] regions. While the city of Yangzhou was the center of trade, flourishing and prosperous, it was considered part of Jiangnan, which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangzi river. Once Yangzhou's wealth and prosperity were gone, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei, the \"backwater\". After Yangzhou was removed from Jiangnan, its residents decided{{dubious|date=January 2016}} to replace [[Jianghuai Mandarin]], which was the dialect of Yangzhou, with [[Taihu Wu dialects]]. In Jiangnan itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of prestige dialect.<ref>{{cite book\n | url=https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo\n | url-access=registration\n | title=Teachers of the inner chambers: women and culture in seventeenth-century China\n | year=1994\n | author=Dorothy Ko\n | publisher=Stanford University Press\n | edition=illustrated, annotated\n | isbn=0-8047-2359-1\n | page=[https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo/page/21 21]\n | quote=With the exclusion of Yangzhou came the denigration of its dialect, a variant of Jianghuai \"Mandarin\" (guanhua).

The innovative painter-calligrapher [[Shitao]] lived in Yangzhou during the 1680s and again from 1697 until his death in 1707. A later group of painters from that time called the [[Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou]] are famous throughout China.\n\nFormer General secretary of CPC, President of China [[Jiang Zemin]] was born and raised in Yangzhou. His middle school is located right across from the public notary's office in Yangzhou.\n\nYangzhou is famous for its carved [[lacquerware]] and [[jade]].\n\nSome of China's most creative and eye catching dishes come from the Yangzhou school of cuisine called [[Huaiyang cuisine|Huaiyang]] (also commonly known as the Weiyang school). Along with [[Sichuan cuisine]], [[Cantonese cuisine]], and [[Shandong cuisine]], Huaiyang cuisine ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6dee\u626c\u83dc}}) is a distinctive and masterful skill that locals are quite proud of.\n\nThe city is famous for its [[public bath]] houses, [[lacquerware]], jadeware, embroidery, paper-cut, art & crafts velvet flavers.\n\nThe city was awarded [[Habitat Scroll of Honour]] in 2006.\n\nYangzhou is also very famous for its toy industry (especially stuffed animals). Many tourists from neighboring cities travel to the city for its good-quality and low-priced toys.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the city is also famous for an ancient folk art called Yangzhou storytelling ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u8bc4\u8bdd}}), which is like [[Xiangsheng]]\u2014the traditional Chinese comedic performance. It rose as a performing act during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. In the performance, the artist details an interesting historical story to audiences, using Yangzhou dialect. These stories have been edited by artists, so they sound very soul-stirring and funny. The best known artist of Yangzhou storytelling was [[Wang shaotang]]. His most famous works are The 10 chapters of [[Wu Song]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6b66\u5341\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Song Jiang]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b8b\u5341\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Lu Junyi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5362\u5341\u56de}}), and The 10 chapters of [[Shi Xiu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u77f3\u5341\u56de}}).<ref>Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl, The Oral Tradition of Yangzhou Storytelling, London: Routledge, 1996; Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl and Jette Ross, Chinese Storytellers: Life and Art in the Yangzhou Tradition, Cheng and Tsui 2002.</ref>\n[[File:Chinese snowball.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese snowball flowers]]\n\n===Literary references===\nYangzhou was frequently referenced in Chinese literature.  Poet [[Li Bai]] (c.700\u2013762) wrote in ''Seeing Meng Haoran off to Yangzhou from Yellow Crane Pavilion'':\n\n:At Yellow Crane Pavilion in the west\n:My old friend says farewell;\n:In the mist and flowers of spring\n:He goes down to Yangzhou;\n:Lonely sail, distant shadow,\n:Vanish in blue emptiness;\n:All I see is the great river\n:Flowing into the far horizon.\n\n[[Du Mu]] wrote the famous lines on Yangzhou:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8fWf7pYOIUC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=How to Read Chinese Poetry: A Guided Anthology|author= Zong-qi Cai |page= Columbia University Press|date=30 November 2007 |isbn=9780231511889 }}</ref>\n\n:After ten years, I awoke from my Yangzhou dream,\n:All I gained was a fickle reputation in the green mansions.\n\nThe \"green mansions\" or \"green/black lofts\" (''qinglou'') refers to the pleasure districts for which Yangzhou became known.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvFJQ6WE1agC&pg=PA287#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Lifestyle and Entertainment in Yangzhou|authors= Lucie B.

Yangzhou is famous for its many well preserved Yangzhou style gardens.  Most of the Historic city is in the Guangling District.\n\n===Slender West Lake===\n{{main|Slender West Lake}}\nNamed after Hangzhou's famous West Lake, this long, narrow stretch of water which meanders through Yangzhou's western limits is a well-known scenic spot. A long bank planted with weeping willows spans the lake; at its midpoint stands a square terrace with pavilions at each of the corners and one in the center. Around the lake is a park in which are found several attractions: Lotus Flower Pagoda (Lianhua SO), a white structure reminiscent of the White Pagoda (Baita) in Beijing's Beihai Park; Small Gold Mountain (Xiao Jin Shan); and the Fishing Platform (Diaoyutai), a favorite retreat of the Qing emperor Qian Long. The emperor was so gratified by his luck in fishing at this spot that he ordered additional stipends for the town. As it turns out, his success had been augmented by local swimmers who lurked in the lake busily attaching fish to his hook.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Serene and Fragrant Study.JPG|Study hall\nImage:Si Qiao Yan Yu Building.jpg|Four bridges in rain and mist\nImage:The Sunny Spring Stage.jpg|Imperial birthday celebration stage\nImage:Du Mu 24 bridge poem.JPG|Mao Zedong's calligraphy of Tang dynasty poet Du Mu poem\nImage:Twenty four bridge.JPG|24 ancient beauties played flute on this bridge\nImage:White pagoda clear sky and cloud garden.JPG|Entrance to a garden\nImage:Jinjingge copy.JPG|The jinjingge bridge\nImage:Xu Garden.jpg|The Xu Garden\n</gallery>\n\n===Daming Temple===\n{{main|Daming Temple}}\nLocated on Shugang Hill, in the city's northwest, is Fajing Temple, formerly known as DaMing Temple. The original temple was built in Liu Song Dynasty (420\u2013479). A nine-story pagoda, the Qilingta, was built on the temple grounds in the year of Sui Dynasty (589\u2013618) . A recent addition to the temple complex is the [[Jianzhen]] Memorial Hall, built according to Tang Dynasty methods and financed with contributions raised by Buddhist groups in Japan.\nWhen Qing Emperor Qian Long visited Yangzhou in 1765, he was troubled by The temple's name DaMing (which literally means \"Great Ming') fearing that it might revive nostalgia for the Ming Dynasty, which was overthrown by his Manchu predecessors. He had it renamed Fajing Temple.\nThe temple was seriously damaged during the Taiping Rebellion at the beginning of the 20th century. The present structure is a reconstruction dating from the 1930s.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Daming temple.JPG|Da Ming Temple\nImage:Jianzhen memorial hall.jpg|Memorial Hall of monk Jianzhen\nImage:QilingP.jpg|Da Ming temple pagoda\n</gallery>\n\n===Flat Hills (Ping Shan) Hall===\nBuilt by the Song Dynasty writer Ouyang Xiu when he served as prefect of the city, this hall stands just west of Fajing Temple. Looking out from this hall, the mountains to the south of the Yangtze River appear as a line at the viewer's eye level, hence the name Flat Hills Hall. When Ouyang Xiu's student Su Dongpo moved to Yangzhou, he too served as prefect of the city. He had a hall built directly behind the one erected by his master, and called it Guling Hall.\n\n===Pavilion of Flourishing Culture ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u6587\u660c\u9601}}}}, W\u00e9nch\u0101ng G\u00e9)===\n[[File:Yangzhou-WenchangGe-traffic-3417.jpg|thumb|Wenchang Ge]]\nThis round, three-story pavilion in Yangzhou's eastern sector was built in 1585 and celebrates the city's rich cultural traditions. It is also the de facto center of the city.\n\nBuilt during [[Ming dynasty]], it is located on the cross of Wenchang Road and Wenhe Road. The whole building is about 79-foot high, and looks like [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing. Today, bordered by many shopping stores, Wenchange had been a symbol of commercial center to residents.\n\n===Stone Pagoda ===\nStanding west of the Pavilion of Flourishing Culture is a five-story Tang Dynasty pagoda ({{zh|s=\u77f3\u5854|hp=Sh\u00edt\u01ce|links=no}}). Built in 837, it is the oldest pagoda still standing in Yangzhou.\n\n===Tomb of Puhaddin===\n[[File:Yangzhou-Minaret-3284.jpg|thumb|left|The mosque complex at the tomb of Puhaddin]]\nThis is essentially a Ming Dynasty graveyard that includes the tomb of [[Puhaddin]]. According to information at the tomb, he was a 16th generation descendant of [[Muhammad]], The Prophet. The tomb is on the eastern bank of the (Old) Grand Canal in the eastern sector of the city and is adjacent to a mosque which houses a collection of valuable materials documenting China's relations with Muslim countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/china/beijing-to-shanghai/review-434792.html|title=Garden Tomb of Puhaddin Beijing to Shanghai Review|website=fodors.com}}</ref>\n\n===Ge Garden ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u4e2a\u5712}}}}, G\u00e8 Yu\u00e1n)===\nThe entrance to this typical southern style garden with its luxuriant bamboo groves, ponds, and rock grottoes is on Dongguan St. in the city's northeast section. Designed by the great Qing Dynasty landscape painter Shi Tao for Wang Yingtai, an officer of the Qing imperial court, this garden takes its name from the shape of bamboo leaves which resemble the Chinese character ge, meaning \"a\" or \"an.\"\n\n===He Garden ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u4f55\u56ed}}}}, H\u00e9 Yu\u00e1n)===\nThis garden, also called Jixiao Shan Zhuang, was built by He Zhidao, a 19th-century Qing government official, this garden home is famous for a {{convert|430|m|ft|abbr=on}}, two storied winding corridor, the walls of which are lined with stone tablets carved with lines of classical poetry, In the garden is also an open-air theater set on an island in the middle of a fish pond.\n\n===Yechun Garden (Yechun Yuan)===\nIn this garden, which lies on the banks of the Xiading River at the city's northern limits, the Qing Dynasty poet Wang Yuyang and a circle of friends used to gather to recite their works. The thatched roofs of the pavilions in this garden give it a quaint, rustic air.\n\n===[[Yangzhou Museum]] & Yangzhou Block Printing Museum ===\n[[File:Yangzhou-Double-Museum-2869.jpg|thumb|Yangzhou Museum / China Block Printing Museum]]\nSituated on the west side of the Bright Moon Lake, the Yangzhou Chinese Block Printing Museum ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u4e2d\u56fd\u96d5\u7248\u5370\u5237\u535a\u7269\u9986}}) and Yangzhou Museum ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u535a\u7269\u9986}}) look into the distance of Yangzhou International Exhibition Centre and covers an area of 50,000 square meters, with a construction space of 25,000 square meters, and an exhibition area of 10,000 square metres. Its unique architectural form embodies the harmony of man nature, structure and natural environment. In August, 2003, over 300,000 ancient books blockings were collected from Guangling Press of Yangzhou and China Block Printing Museum was established under the approval of the State Council, over 300,000 ancient book blockings collected by Guangling Press of Yangzhou were included in the new museum.\n\n===Jiangdu Hydro Project===\nConstruction of this multiple-purpose water control project, the biggest in China, started in 1961 and was completed in 1975. The project includes facilities for irrigation, drainage, navigation, and power generation. It consists of four large modern electric pumping stations, six medium-sized check gates, thrice navigation locks, and two trunk waterways.\n\n==Education==\n*[[Yangzhou University]]\n*[[Sima Primary School]]\n*[[Yangzhou Polytechnic College]]\n*[[Yangzhou Polytechnic Institute]]\n\n==Sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in China}}\n* {{flagdeco|Russia}} [[Balashikha]], Moscow Oblast, Russia\n* {{flagdeco|USA}} [[Kent, Washington]], US<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kentwa.gov/SisterCity-YangzhouChina.html |title=Yangzhou, China |website=City of Kent, Washington}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Malaysia}} [[Malacca City]], Malaysia\n* {{flagdeco|Germany}} [[Neubrandenburg]], Germany<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neubrandenburg.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=192:partnerste&catid=34:partnerste&Itemid=184 |title=Yangzhou, China \u2013 sister city|website=Neubrandenburg, Germany website}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Germany}} [[Offenbach am Main]], Germany (since 1997)<ref>{{cite web|title=Offenbach und seine Partnerst\u00e4dte|url=http://www.offenbach.de/rathaus/stadtinfo/staedtepartnerschaften/staedtepartnerschaften-intro.php|publisher=City of Offenbach|accessdate=25 September 2016|date=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|France}} [[Orl\u00e9ans]], France\n* {{flagdeco|New Zealand}} [[Porirua]], New Zealand<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sistercities.org.nz/index.php?s=cities | title=About Sister Cities | website=Sister Cities New Zealand}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Canada}} [[Vaughan]], Ontario, Canada\n* {{flagdeco|USA}} [[Westport, Connecticut]], US<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westportct.gov/index.aspx?page=190 |title=Sister Cities Committee |website=Westport, Connecticut}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Iranians in China]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | first = Alvyn | last = Austin | authorlink = Alvyn Austin | year = 2007 | title = China\u2019s Millions: The China Inland Mission and Late Qing Society | publisher = Eerdmans | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan | isbn =978-0-8028-2975-7}}\n*{{cite book | first = Antonia | last = Finnane | authorlink = Antonia Finnane| year = 2004 | title = Speaking of Yangzhou: A Chinese City, 1550 - 1850| publisher = Harvard Asia Center | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn =0674013921}}\n* {{cite book | first = Jonathan | last = Hay | authorlink = Jonathan Hay (author)| year = 2001 | title = Shitao: Painting and Modernity in Early Qing China| publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York| isbn =0-521-39342-6}}\n*{{cite book | first = Ping-ti| last = Ho | authorlink = Ping-to Ho| year = 1954 | title = \"The Salt Merchants of Yang-chou: A Study of Commercial Capital in Eighteenth-Century China,\"Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 17: 130-168}}\n*{{cite book | first = Ginger Cheng-chi | last = Hs\u00fc | authorlink = Ginger Cheng-chi Hs\u00fc | year = 2001 | title = A Bushel of Pearls: Painting for Sale in Eighteenth-Century Yangchow| publisher = Stanford University Press| location = Stanford, California| isbn =0-8047-3252-3}}\n*{{cite book | first = Tobie | last = Meyer-Fong | authorlink = Tobie Meyer-Fong| year = 2003 | title = Building Culture in Early Qing Yangzhou| publisher = Stanford University Press| location = Stanford, California | isbn =0-8047-4485-8}}\n*{{cite book | first = Lucie, and Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl| last = Olivov\u00e1 | year = 2009 | title = Lifestyle and entertainment in Yangzhou| publisher = NIAS Press| location = Copenhagen| isbn =978-87-7694-035-5}}\n* \"Yangzhou.\" ''Encyclopedia of China''. ed.

Sitting on the north bank of the [[Yangtze]], it borders the provincial capital [[Nanjing]] to the southwest, [[Huai'an]] to the north, [[Yancheng]] to the northeast, [[Taizhou, Jiangsu|Taizhou]] to the east, and [[Zhenjiang]] across the river to the south. Its population was 4,414,681 at the 2010 census and its urban area is home to 2,146,980 inhabitants, including three urban districts, currently in the agglomeration.\n\nHistorically, Yangzhou was one of the wealthiest cities in China, known at various periods for its great merchant families, poets, artists, and scholars. Its name (<small>lit.</small> \"Rising Prefecture\") refers to its former position as the capital of the ancient [[Yangzhou (ancient China)|Yangzhou]] prefecture in [[History of the administrative divisions of China before 1912|imperial China]].

After the defeat of [[Yue (state)|Yue]] by [[King Fuchai of Wu]], a garrison city was built {{Convert|12|m|abbr=on}} above the water level on the north bank of the Yangtze c.&nbsp;485&nbsp;BC.  This city in the shape of a three by three ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' square was named Hancheng.<ref>Schinz, 1996</ref>  The newly built Han canal formed a moat around the south and east sides of the city. The purpose of Hancheng was to protect [[Suzhou]] from naval invasion from [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. During the [[Han dynasty]], Guangling was the seat of [[Guangling Commandery]]. It constituted a part of the [[Xu Province]], rather than the [[Yang Province]] (Yangzhou), which was covered the entire southeastern part of China then. In 590, the city was made the capital of a newly established [[Yang Prefecture (Jiangsu)|Yang Prefecture]], and began to be referred to with its current name.\n\nUnder [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] (r. 604\u2013617), Yangzhou was the southern capital of China. It was called Jiangdu upon the completion of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] until the fall of the [[Sui dynasty]]. By the mid 610s, a combination of fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, together with natural disasters and provincial unrest, ensured many people Emperor Yang had lost the legitimacy of his monarchy. As revolts spread across China in 616, the Emperor abandoned the North and meanwhile withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.\n\n===Tang Dynasty===\nThe city has remained a leading economic and cultural center and major port of foreign trade and external exchange since the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907). Many Arab and Persian merchants lived in the city in the 7th century, but they were massacred in the thousands in 760 during the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] by Tian Shengong's ({{zh|s=\u7530\u795e\u529f|hp=Ti\u00e1n Sh\u00e9ng\u014dng|w=T'ien Shen-kung|links=no}}) rebel insurgents during the [[Yangzhou massacre (760)]].<ref name=\"Perkins\">{{Cite book|last=Perkins|first=Dorothy|title=Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture|publisher=Roundtable Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8160-4374-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|accessdate=2012-01-10|quote=Probably by the 7th century Persians had joined with Arabs to create the foreign emporium on the Grand Canal at Yangchou mentioned by the New T'ang History.

This blast killed over a hundred guards, hurled debris from buildings into the air that landed ten ''li'' away from the site of the explosion, and could be felt 100 ''li'' away as tiles on roofs shook (refer to [[gunpowder]] article).\n\n[[Marco Polo]] claimed to have served the [[Yuan dynasty]] in Yangzhou under [[Kubilai Khan]] in the period around 1282\u20131287 (to 1285, according to Perkins<ref name=\"Perkins\" />). Although some versions of Polo's memoirs imply that he was the governor of Yangzhou, it is more likely that he was an official in the salt industry, if indeed he was employed there at all. Chinese texts offer no supporting evidence for his claim. The discovery of the 1342 tomb of [[Katarina Vilioni]], member of an Italian trading family in Yangzhou, does, however, suggest the existence of a thriving Italian community in the city in the 14th century. Moreover, both in [[The Travels of Marco Polo]] and in the [[History of Yuan]] there is documentation about a [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christian]], who funded two churches in China during the three years he served as an official of the emperor: this functionary is named \"Mar Sarchis\" by Marco Polo and \"Ma Xuelijisi\" in the History of Yuan.

As early as 1655, the Dutch envoy [[Johan Nieuhof]] described the city (''Jamcefu'', i.e. Yangzhou-Fu, in his transcription) commented on the city's salt trade as follows:<ref>[[Johan Nieuhof]],\n''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=turn&entity=DLDecArts.Nieuhof.p0108 An embassy from the East-India Company of the United Provinces, to the Grand Tartar Cham, emperor of China: delivered by their excellencies Peter de Goyer and Jacob de Keyzer, at his imperial city of Peking wherein the cities, towns, villages, ports, rivers, &c. in their passages from Canton to Peking are ingeniously described by John Nieuhoff; ...

The riot that resulted was an angry crowd estimated at eight to ten thousand who assaulted the premises of the British [[OMF International|China Inland Mission]] in Yangzhou by looting, burning and attacking the missionaries led by [[Hudson Taylor]]. No one was killed, however several of the missionaries were injured as they were forced to flee for their lives. As a result of the report of the riot, the British consul in [[Shanghai]], [[Walter Henry Medhurst (consul)|Sir Walter Henry Medhurst]] took seventy [[Royal Marines]] in a [[man-of-war]] and steamed up the Yangtze to Nanjing in a controversial show of force that eventually resulted in an official apology from [[Viceroy]] [[Zeng Guofan]] and financial restitution made to the injured missionaries.\n\nFrom the time of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1853) to the beginning of the Reform Era (1980) Yangzhou was in decline, due to war damage, neglect of the Grand Canal as railways replaced it in importance, and stagnation in the early decades of the PRC. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], it endured eight years of enemy occupation and was used by the Japanese as a site for internment camps. About 1200 civilians of Allied nationalities (mostly British and Australian) from Shanghai were transported here in 1943, and located in one of three camps (A, B, and C). Camps B and C were closed down in September, 1943, after the second American-Japanese prisoner exchange, and their inhabitants transferred back to Shanghai camps.  Camp C, located in the former American Mission in the north-west of the city, was maintained for the duration of the war.<ref>Leck, Greg, ''Captives of Empire: The Japanese Internment of Allied Civilians in China'' Shandy Press, 2006; Antonia Finnane, ''Far From Where?

The city's status as a leading economic centre in China was never to be restored. Not until the 1990s did it begin to regain some semblance of prosperity, benefitting from national economic growth and a number of targeted development projects. With the canal now partially restored, and excellent rail and road connections, Yangzhou is once again an important transportation and market center. It also has some industrial output, chiefly in cotton and textiles. In 2004, a railway linked Yangzhou for the first time with Nanjing.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Yangzhou five pavilion bridge.JPG|thumb|250px|The Five Pavilion Bridge over Shouxi Lake.]]\nYangzhou is located on a plain north of the Yangtze. The Grand Canal, also known as the  [[Beijing|Jing]]-[[Hangzhou|Hang]] Canal, crosses the prefecture-level from the north to the south; its modern route passes through the eastern outskirts of Yangzhou's main urban area, while its old route runs through the city center. Other major bodies of water within the prefecture-level city include the [[Baoshe River]], [[Datong River]], [[Beichengzi River]], [[Tongyang Canal]], [[Xintongyang Canal]], [[Baima Lake]], [[Baoying Lake]], [[Gaoyou Lake]] and [[Shaobo Lake]].\n\nLike much of the entire prefecture-level city, Yangzhou's main urban area (the \"city proper\") is criss-crossed by an intricate network of canals and small lakes. The historic city center  (the former waled city) is surrounded by canals on all sides: the Old Grand Canal forms its eastern and southern boundaries; the City Moat Canal runs along the former walled city's northern edge, connecting the Old Grand Canal with the [[Slender West Lake]]; the Erdaohe Canal runs along the old city's western edge, from the Slender West Lake to the [[Hehuachi Park|Lotus Flower Pond]] (Hehuachi), which in its turn is connected by the short Erdaogou canal with the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://yangzhou.yztm.net/tnewsshow.asp?id=450 \u53e4\u8fd0\u6cb3\u2014\u8377\u82b1\u6c60\u2014\u7626\u897f\u6e56\u6c34\u4e0a\u6e38\u89c8\u7ebf\u5168\u90e8\u8d2f\u901a] (The Old Grand Canal - Hehua Pond - Thin West Lake tourist waterway is fully open), 2010-09-20</ref> It is possible to sail a small water craft from the Thin West Lake, via the Erdaohe, the Hehua Pond, and the Erdaogou into the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://www.yzcn.net/broadcast/pic/2011/0329/124850.shtml \u7eff\u6768\u57ce\u90ed\u6c34\u4e0a\u6e384\u00b718\u4eae\u76f8],  2011-3-29; see the map in this article</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nYangzhou has a subtropical monsoon climate with humid changeable wind; longer winters for about 4 months, summers 3 months and shorter springs and autumns, 2 months respectively; frost-free period of 222 days and annual average sunshine of 2177 hours.\n\nThe mean annual temperature is {{convert|15.72|\u00b0C|1}} annually; the normal monthly mean 24-hour temperature ranges from {{convert|2.5|\u00b0C}} in January to {{convert|28.0|\u00b0C}} in July.\n\nThe annual average precipitation is {{convert|1043|mm|abbr=on}}, and about 45 percent of rainfall is concentrated in the summer. The rainy season known as \"plum rain season\" usually lasts from mid-June to late July.

The [[Nanjing Lukou International Airport]] is over {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; it takes one hour and 40 minutes to get there from central Yangzhou. Prior to the completion of the Yangzhou Taizhou Airport, Lukou Airport in Nanjing was the primary air gateway for passengers destined for Yangzhou. There are over 10 airline ticket offices in Yangzhou, providing convenient service for foreign and domestic tourists. domestic and international fight are available with 10 international airlines and more than 20 domestic ones\n\n===Rail===\nUntil 2004, Yangzhou was not served by passenger rail. [[Yangzhou Railway Station]] began construction in 2003 and was completed a year later. It is located on the western outskirts of the city, and is a major station on the [[Nanjing\u2013Qidong Railway]], and provides direct passenger service to the provincial capital as well as a number of major cities to the west, north, and south (such as [[Xi'an]], [[Wuhan]], and [[Guangzhou]]), including an overnight [[Z-series trains|Z-series express train]] to [[Beijing]].<ref>[http://www.tielu.org/ tielu.org], schedule search for Yangzhou</ref> Later, frequent high-speed (D-series) service has been introduced on this line as well.\n\nThere is no direct rail service between Yangzhou and [[Shanghai]], however; to travel to Shanghai, or elsewhere in the [[Yangtze Delta]] regions, travelers cross the Yangtze over the new [[Runyang Bridge]] to Zhenjiang (frequent commuter bus service is available) and take a train from the [[Zhenjiang Railway Station]], which is located on the main Nanjing-Shanghai rail line.\n\nIn 2016, construction work started on a new north-south rail line, the Lianyungan-Huai'an-Yangzhou-Zhenjiang Railway.

The average water depth is 15\u201320 meters. In 1992, the State Council approved it to become a first-grade open state harbour, and General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] inscribed its name. Now, it has developed into a comprehensive [[inland harbor]], integrating passenger, freight, container transportation and harbour trade, and has become the main distribution center of northern Jiangsu province, eastern [[Anhui]] Province and southeast [[Shandong]] Province. There are several dozen categories of goods including iron and steel, timber, minerals, coal, grain, cotton, container, products of light industry and machinery. The passenger routes reach Nanjing, Wuhu, [[Jiujiang]], [[Huangshi]] and [[Wuhan]] in the west, and [[Nantong]] and [[Shanghai]] in the east. Some well-known luxury international liners also anchor here. The harbour has greatly promoted the development of exports and the overall local economy.\n\n===Expressways===\n\nThe Ningyang (Nanjing\u2013Yangzhou) Expressway crosses the southern part of Yangzhou's metropolitan area while the Ningtong (Nanjing\u2013Nantong) Expressway is connected to Yangzhou at Liaojiagou. In recent years, local government have attached great importance to the development of the tourism, in conjunction with a greater effort dedicated to the improvement of the local road transport system. With a total investment of 680 million yuan, the Yangzhou section of the Ningyang Expressway was completed on December 18, 1998 and opened to traffic in June 1999. Stretching nearly {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}}, the section of the expressway starts from the Bazi Flyover as the entry/exit, via the Yanggua Highway, the Tonggang Highway, an ancient canal, the Yangwei Highway, the Beijing\u2013Hangzhou Grand Canal and the Yangling Highway, to Liqojiagou Entry/Exit of Yangjiang Highway. It then passes the Jiangdu Flyover to directly link up with the Huaijiang Expressway. In addition, the section of Huaijiang Expressway within the territory of Yangzhou began construction on March 22, 1997, which will be commonly used by the state planned Tongjiang\u2013Sanya and Beijing\u2013Shanghai trunk lines. The section of Huaijiang Expressway in Yangzhou totals {{convert|112.04|km|abbr=on}}in length, starting from Jinghe Town of Baoying in the north to the entry/exist of Zhuanqiaozhen Flyover of Jiangdu in the south. It then links with Ningtong Expressway, passing by three counties (cities) such as Baoying, Gaoyou and Jiangdu and 26 towns, at a total cost of 3.7 billion yuan. It is expected to be open to traffic by the year 2000.\n[[File:Yangzhou-Modern-Grand-Canal-barge-caravan-3342.JPG|thumb|The modern route of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] passes within a few kilometers east of the city's main urban area]]\n\n===Intercity bus service===\nDuring the daytime, frequent bus service operates between Yangzhou and nearby cities. There are several bus stations on the city's outskirts; most of the buses from [[Nanjing]] (Nanjing West Bus Station) and Zhenjiang (where the bus station is adjacent to the [[Zhenjiang Railway Station]]) arrive to Yangzhou South Bus Station, located a few kilometers southwest from downtown. Most of the intercity bus service stops in the early evening.\n\n===Transportation in the Urban Area===\nThe city is served by an extensive network of public bus routes.\n\nYangzhou's taxi industry began in 1982, and has developed rapidly since 1993. the city has over 40 taxi companies of various ownership structures, with a total of 1,571 vehicles. Parking lots were established at key stations and hotels, and eight taxi companies have opened round-the-clock telephone service. The construction department of the municipal government has strengthened the management of taxi services, providing education in the relevant laws, professional ethics and safety aspects.\n\nIn 2014, Yangzhou's government approved plans for the construction of a subway system, which will initially include two lines. Line 1 will run in the general east-west direction, from Yangzhou Railway Station in the west to the historic central city to the future high-speed railway station (east of the Grand Canal) to [[Jiangdu District]]. Line 2 will run in the general north-south direction.<ref>[http://www.yznews.com.cn/09zjyz/jr/2014-06/06/content_5228300.htm \u626c\u5dde\u5730 1\u30012\u53f7\u7ebf\u8d70\u5411\u521d\u5b9a], 2014-06-06</ref>\n\n===Tourist Transportation===\n\nTo develop tourism in Yangzhou, sightseeing buses have been introduced in the city run by the Tianma travel agency under the Yangzhou Tourist Bureau. There is a tour guide on each bus. The route, starting from Yangzhou station, has eight stops, and passes by such scenic spots of the Slender West Lake, Daming Temple, Imperial Dock, Siwang Pagoda, Wenchang Pagoda and Shita Temple.

They have an appealing color, aroma, taste and appearance. The original color of each ingredient is preserved after cooking, and no oily sauce is added, so as to retain the fresh flavour of the food.\n\nIn Yangzhou all dishes, whether cheap or expensive, are elaborate. Cooks will not scrimp on their work, even with [[dazhu gansi]] ({{zh|c=\u5927\u716e\u5e72\u4e1d|p=d\u00e0zh\u01d4 g\u0101ns\u012b}}), a popular dish that costs only a few yuan. Dry bean curd is made by each restaurant that serves it, so the flavor is guaranteed. The cook slices the 1-cm-thick curd into 30 shreds, each one paper-thin but none broken, and then stews them for hours with chopped bamboo shoots and shelled shrimps in chicken soup. In this way the dry bean curd shreds can soak up the flavor of the other ingredients, and the soup is clear but savory. Not only Yangzhou cooks, but also the ordinary people are conscientious about cooking.\n\n* [[Fu Chun Teahouse]]\n* [[Yangzhou fried rice]], is said {{by whom|date=May 2014}} to have been invented by a person who was a former Yangzhou [[magistrate]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Yangzhou-childrens-library-scooter-parking-3411.jpg|thumb|Children's Library building, on the premises of Yangzhou Public Library]]\nThe Yangzhou dialect ({{zh|c=\u626c\u5dde\u8bdd|p=Y\u00e1ngzh\u014du hu\u00e0|links=no}}) of Chinese is representative of [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]], and is particularly close to the [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|official language]] of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] courts, which was based on the [[Nanjing dialect]]. However, it does differ considerably from modern [[Standard Chinese]], although they are still moderately [[mutually intelligible]].\n\nDialect has also been used as a tool for regional identity and politics in the [[Jiangbei region|Jiangbei]] and [[Jiangnan]] regions. While the city of Yangzhou was the center of trade, flourishing and prosperous, it was considered part of Jiangnan, which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangzi river. Once Yangzhou's wealth and prosperity were gone, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei, the \"backwater\". After Yangzhou was removed from Jiangnan, its residents decided{{dubious|date=January 2016}} to replace [[Jianghuai Mandarin]], which was the dialect of Yangzhou, with [[Taihu Wu dialects]]. In Jiangnan itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of prestige dialect.<ref>{{cite book\n | url=https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo\n | url-access=registration\n | title=Teachers of the inner chambers: women and culture in seventeenth-century China\n | volume=\n | year=1994\n | author=Dorothy Ko\n | publisher=Stanford University Press\n | edition=illustrated, annotated\n | location=\n | isbn=0-8047-2359-1\n | page=[https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo/page/21 21]\n | pages=\n | quote=With the exclusion of Yangzhou came the denigration of its dialect, a variant of Jianghuai \"Mandarin\" (guanhua).

The innovative painter-calligrapher [[Shitao]] lived in Yangzhou during the 1680s and again from 1697 until his death in 1707. A later group of painters from that time called the [[Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou]] are famous throughout China.\n\nFormer General secretary of CPC, President of China [[Jiang Zemin]] was born and raised in Yangzhou. His middle school is located right across from the public notary's office in Yangzhou.\n\nYangzhou is famous for its carved [[lacquerware]] and [[jade]].\n\nSome of China's most creative and eye catching dishes come from the Yangzhou school of cuisine called [[Huaiyang cuisine|Huaiyang]] (also commonly known as the Weiyang school). Along with [[Sichuan cuisine]], [[Cantonese cuisine]], and [[Shandong cuisine]], Huaiyang cuisine ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6dee\u626c\u83dc}}) is a distinctive and masterful skill that locals are quite proud of.\n\nThe city is famous for its [[public bath]] houses, [[lacquerware]], jadeware, embroidery, paper-cut, art & crafts velvet flavers.\n\nThe city was awarded [[Habitat Scroll of Honour]] in 2006.\n\nYangzhou is also very famous for its toy industry (especially stuffed animals). Many tourists from neighboring cities travel to the city for its good-quality and low-priced toys.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the city is also famous for an ancient folk art called Yangzhou storytelling ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u8bc4\u8bdd}}), which is like [[Xiangsheng]]\u2014the traditional Chinese comedic performance. It rose as a performing act during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. In the performance, the artist details an interesting historical story to audiences, using Yangzhou dialect. These stories have been edited by artists, so they sound very soul-stirring and funny. The best known artist of Yangzhou storytelling was [[Wang shaotang]]. His most famous works are The 10 chapters of [[Wu Song]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6b66\u5341\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Song Jiang]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b8b\u5341\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Lu Junyi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5362\u5341\u56de}}), and The 10 chapters of [[Shi Xiu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u77f3\u5341\u56de}}).<ref>Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl, The Oral Tradition of Yangzhou Storytelling, London: Routledge, 1996; Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl and Jette Ross, Chinese Storytellers: Life and Art in the Yangzhou Tradition, Cheng and Tsui 2002.</ref>\n[[File:Chinese snowball.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese snowball flowers]]\n\n===Literary references===\nYangzhou was frequently referenced in Chinese literature.  Poet [[Li Bai]] (c.700\u2013762) wrote in ''Seeing Meng Haoran off to Yangzhou from Yellow Crane Pavilion'':\n\n:At Yellow Crane Pavilion in the west\n:My old friend says farewell;\n:In the mist and flowers of spring\n:He goes down to Yangzhou;\n:Lonely sail, distant shadow,\n:Vanish in blue emptiness;\n:All I see is the great river\n:Flowing into the far horizon.\n\n[[Du Mu]] wrote the famous lines on Yangzhou:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8fWf7pYOIUC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=How to Read Chinese Poetry: A Guided Anthology|author= Zong-qi Cai |page= Columbia University Press|date=30 November 2007 |isbn=9780231511889 }}</ref>\n\n:After ten years, I awoke from my Yangzhou dream,\n:All I gained was a fickle reputation in the green mansions.\n\nThe \"green mansions\" or \"green/black lofts\" (''qinglou'') refers to the pleasure districts for which Yangzhou became known.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvFJQ6WE1agC&pg=PA287#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Lifestyle and Entertainment in Yangzhou|authors= Lucie B.

Yangzhou is famous for its many well preserved Yangzhou style gardens.  Most of the Historic city is in the Guangling District.\n\n===Slender West Lake===\n{{main|Slender West Lake}}\nNamed after Hangzhou's famous West Lake, this long, narrow stretch of water which meanders through Yangzhou's western limits is a well-known scenic spot. A long bank planted with weeping willows spans the lake; at its midpoint stands a square terrace with pavilions at each of the corners and one in the center. Around the lake is a park in which are found several attractions: Lotus Flower Pagoda (Lianhua SO), a white structure reminiscent of the White Pagoda (Baita) in Beijing's Beihai Park; Small Gold Mountain (Xiao Jin Shan); and the Fishing Platform (Diaoyutai), a favorite retreat of the Qing emperor Qian Long. The emperor was so gratified by his luck in fishing at this spot that he ordered additional stipends for the town. As it turns out, his success had been augmented by local swimmers who lurked in the lake busily attaching fish to his hook.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Serene and Fragrant Study.JPG|Study hall\nImage:Si Qiao Yan Yu Building.jpg|Four bridges in rain and mist\nImage:The Sunny Spring Stage.jpg|Imperial birthday celebration stage\nImage:Du Mu 24 bridge poem.JPG|Mao Zedong's calligraphy of Tang dynasty poet Du Mu poem\nImage:Twenty four bridge.JPG|24 ancient beauties played flute on this bridge\nImage:White pagoda clear sky and cloud garden.JPG|Entrance to a garden\nImage:Jinjingge copy.JPG|The jinjingge bridge\nImage:Xu Garden.jpg|The Xu Garden\n</gallery>\n\n===Daming Temple===\n{{main|Daming Temple}}\nLocated on Shugang Hill, in the city's northwest, is Fajing Temple, formerly known as DaMing Temple. The original temple was built in Liu Song Dynasty  (420\u2013479). A nine-story pagoda, the Qilingta, was built on the temple grounds in the year of Sui Dynasty (589\u2013618) . A recent addition to the temple complex is the [[Jianzhen]] Memorial Hall, built according to Tang Dynasty methods and financed with contributions raised by Buddhist groups in Japan.\nWhen Qing Emperor Qian Long visited Yangzhou in 1765, he was troubled by The temple's name DaMing (which literally means \"Great Ming') fearing that it might revive nostalgia for the Ming Dynasty, which was overthrown by his Manchu predecessors. He had it renamed Fajing Temple.\nThe temple was seriously damaged during the Taiping Rebellion at the beginning of the 20th century. The present structure is a reconstruction dating from the 1930s.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Daming temple.JPG|Da Ming Temple\nImage:Jianzhen memorial hall.jpg|Memorial Hall of monk Jianzhen\nImage:QilingP.jpg|Da Ming temple pagoda\n</gallery>\n\n===Flat Hills (Ping Shan) Hall===\nBuilt by the Song Dynasty writer Ouyang Xiu when he served as prefect of the city, this hall stands just west of Fajing Temple. Looking out from this hall, the mountains to the south of the Yangtze River appear as a line at the viewer's eye level, hence the name Flat Hills Hall. When Ouyang Xiu's student Su Dongpo moved to Yangzhou, he too served as prefect of the city. He had a hall built directly behind the one erected by his master, and called it Guling Hall.\n\n===Pavilion of Flourishing Culture ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u6587\u660c\u9601}}}}, W\u00e9nch\u0101ng G\u00e9)===\n[[File:Yangzhou-WenchangGe-traffic-3417.jpg|thumb|Wenchang Ge]]\nThis round, three-story pavilion in Yangzhou's eastern sector was built in 1585 and celebrates the city's rich cultural traditions. It is also the de facto center of the city.\n\nBuilt during [[Ming dynasty]], it is located on the cross of Wenchang Road and Wenhe Road. The whole building is about 79 foot high, and looks like [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing. Today, bordered by many shopping stores, Wenchange had been a symbol of commercial center to residents.\n\n===Stone Pagoda ===\nStanding west of the Pavilion of Flourishing Culture is a five-story Tang Dynasty pagoda ({{zh|s=\u77f3\u5854|hp=Sh\u00edt\u01ce|links=no}}). Built in 837, it is the oldest pagoda still standing in Yangzhou.\n\n===Tomb of Puhaddin===\n[[File:Yangzhou-Minaret-3284.jpg|thumb|left|The mosque complex at the tomb of Puhaddin]]\nThis is essentially a Ming Dynasty graveyard that includes the tomb of [[Puhaddin]]. According to information at the tomb, he was a 16th generation descendant of [[Muhammad]], The Prophet. The tomb is on the eastern bank of the (Old) Grand Canal in the eastern sector of the city and is adjacent to a mosque which houses a collection of valuable materials documenting China's relations with Muslim countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/china/beijing-to-shanghai/review-434792.html|title=Garden Tomb of Puhaddin Beijing to Shanghai Review|website=www.fodors.com}}</ref>\n\n===Ge Garden ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u4e2a\u5712}}}}, G\u00e8 Yu\u00e1n)===\nThe entrance to this typical southern style garden with its luxuriant bamboo groves, ponds, and rock grottoes is on Dongguan St. in the city's northeast section. Designed by the great Qing Dynasty landscape painter Shi Tao for Wang Yingtai, an officer of the Qing imperial court, this garden takes its name from the shape of bamboo leaves which resemble the Chinese character ge, meaning \"a\" or \"an.\"\n\n===He Garden ({{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u4f55\u56ed}}}}, H\u00e9 Yu\u00e1n)===\nThis garden, also called Jixiao Shan Zhuang, was built by He Zhidao, a 19th-century Qing government official, this garden home is famous for a {{convert|430|m|ft|abbr=on}}, two storied winding corridor, the walls of which are lined with stone tablets carved with lines of classical poetry, In the garden is also an open-air theater set on an island in the middle of a fish pond.\n\n===Yechun Garden (Yechun Yuan)===\nIn this garden, which lies on the banks of the Xiading River at the city's northern limits, the Qing Dynasty poet Wang Yuyang and a circle of friends used to gather to recite their works. The thatched roofs of the pavilions in this garden give it a quaint, rustic air.\n\n===[[Yangzhou Museum]] & Yangzhou Block Printing Museum ===\n[[File:Yangzhou-Double-Museum-2869.jpg|thumb|Yangzhou Museum / China Block Printing Museum]]\nSituated on the west side of the Bright Moon Lake, the Yangzhou Chinese Block Printing Museum ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u4e2d\u56fd\u96d5\u7248\u5370\u5237\u535a\u7269\u9986}}) and Yangzhou Museum ({{lang|zh-hans|\u626c\u5dde\u535a\u7269\u9986}}) look into the distance of Yangzhou International Exhibition Centre and covers an area of 50,000 square meters, with a construction space of 25,000 square meters, and an exhibition area of 10,000 square metres. Its unique architectural form embodies the harmony of man nature, structure and natural environment. In August, 2003, over 300,000 ancient books blockings were collected from Guangling Press of Yangzhou and China Block Printing Museum was established under the approval of the State Council, over 300,000 ancient book blockings collected by Guangling Press of Yangzhou were included in the new museum.\n\n===Jiangdu Hydro Project===\nConstruction of this multiple-purpose water control project, the biggest in China, started in 1961 and was completed in 1975. The project includes facilities for irrigation, drainage, navigation, and power generation. It consists of four large modern electric pumping stations, six medium-sized check gates, thrice navigation locks, and two trunk waterways.\n\n==Education==\n*[[Yangzhou University]]\n*[[Sima Primary School]]\n*[[Yangzhou Polytechnic College]]\n*[[Yangzhou Polytechnic Institute]]\n\n==Sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in China}}\n* {{flagdeco|Russia}} [[Balashikha]], Moscow Oblast, Russia\n* {{flagdeco|USA}} [[Kent, Washington]], US<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kentwa.gov/SisterCity-YangzhouChina.html |title=Yangzhou, China |website=City of Kent, Washington}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Malaysia}} [[Malacca City]], Malaysia\n* {{flagdeco|Germany}} [[Neubrandenburg]], Germany<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neubrandenburg.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=192:partnerste&catid=34:partnerste&Itemid=184 |title=Yangzhou, China - sister city|website=Neubrandenburg, Germany website}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Germany}} [[Offenbach am Main]], Germany (since 1997)<ref>{{cite web|title=Offenbach und seine Partnerst\u00e4dte|url=http://www.offenbach.de/rathaus/stadtinfo/staedtepartnerschaften/staedtepartnerschaften-intro.php|publisher=City of Offenbach|accessdate=25 September 2016|date=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|France}} [[Orl\u00e9ans]], France\n* {{flagdeco|New Zealand}} [[Porirua]], New Zealand<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sistercities.org.nz/index.php?s=cities | title=About Sister Cities | website=Sister Cities New Zealand}}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|Canada}} [[Vaughan]], Ontario, Canada\n* {{flagdeco|USA}} [[Westport, Connecticut]], US<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westportct.gov/index.aspx?page=190 |title=Sister Cities Committee |website=Westport, Connecticut}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Iranians in China]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | first = Alvyn | last = Austin | authorlink = Alvyn Austin | year = 2007 | title = China\u2019s Millions: The China Inland Mission and Late Qing Society | publisher = Eerdmans | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan | isbn =978-0-8028-2975-7}}\n*{{cite book | first = Antonia | last = Finnane | authorlink = Antonia Finnane| year = 2004 | title = Speaking of Yangzhou: A Chinese City, 1550 - 1850| publisher = Harvard Asia Center | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn =0674013921}}\n* {{cite book | first = Jonathan | last = Hay | authorlink = Jonathan Hay (author)| year = 2001 | title = Shitao: Painting and Modernity in Early Qing China| publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York| isbn =0-521-39342-6}}\n*{{cite book | first = Ping-ti| last = Ho | authorlink = Ping-to Ho| year = 1954 | title = \"The Salt Merchants of Yang-chou: A Study of Commercial Capital in Eighteenth-Century China,\"Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 17: 130-168}}\n*{{cite book | first = Ginger Cheng-chi | last = Hs\u00fc | authorlink = Ginger Cheng-chi Hs\u00fc | year = 2001 | title = A Bushel of Pearls: Painting for Sale in Eighteenth-Century Yangchow| publisher = Stanford University Press| location = Stanford, California| isbn =0-8047-3252-3}}\n*{{cite book | first = Tobie | last = Meyer-Fong | authorlink = Tobie Meyer-Fong| year = 2003 | title = Building Culture in Early Qing Yangzhou| publisher = Stanford University Press| location = Stanford, California | isbn =0-8047-4485-8}}\n*{{cite book | first = Lucie, and Vibeke B\u00f8rdahl| last = Olivov\u00e1 | year = 2009 | title = Lifestyle and entertainment in Yangzhou| publisher = NIAS Press| location = Copenhagen| isbn =978-87-7694-035-5}}\n* \"Yangzhou.\" ''Encyclopedia of China''. ed.
