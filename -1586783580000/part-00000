France was then at war with Great Britain, and despite his best efforts, Monroe could not convince the French government that this was a benign treaty and would not affect Franco-American relations. President Washington recalled Monroe, and nominated Pinckney as his successor. Pinckney was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in September 1796, and arrived in Paris in November.<br>The [[French Directory]] refused to accept Pinckney's credentials, and negotiations between the countries broke down when French officials demanded a substantial bribe to do so, in what became known as the [[XYZ Affair]].<br>Miles's theory is that Pinckney's copy of the Lansdowne portrait was intended as a diplomatic gift from the U.S. to France. Pinckney's deliberate humiliation and the suspension of diplomatic relations between the countries (for nearly 5 years) caused those plans (and the portrait) to be abandoned.<br>Supporting evidence for the diplomatic gift theory is that Pinckney later sought reimbursement from Secretary of State Timothy Pickering for the $500 that he had paid to Stuart for the portrait.<ref name=\"Miles lecture\"/>}} Pinckney paid for but never retrieved his copy of the portrait from Stuart's studio, and the artist seems to have resold it to Baker by December 1797.<ref name=\"Stretch\">Bonnie Barrett Stretch, \"The White House Washington, If Stuart Didn't Paint It, Who Did?\" ''ArtNews'', October 1, 2004.[http://www.artnews.com/2004/10/01/the-white-house-washington/]</ref>\n\n==Provenance==\n<blockquote>After the death of Lord Lansdowne, his pictures were sold by auction. The ''Washington'' was purchased by Samuel Williams, an English {{sic}} merchant, for $2,000. Williams subsequently became insolvent, and his creditors disposed of the ''Washington'' by a lottery. Forty tickets were sold, at fifty guineas each. The picture fell to Mr. J. Delaware Lewis, a nephew of Mr. William D. Lewis, of Philadelphia. But few Americans had ever seen the picture, and Mr. William D. Lewis, who was Chairman of the Committee on Art, obtained the loan of it from his nephew for the [[1876 Centennial Exposition|Centennial Exhibition]]. It was sent out with the loan collection from England, unpacked at [[Memorial Hall (Philadelphia)|Memorial Hall]], and hung up in the British section before its arrival was known to the Fine Arts Committee. An effort was subsequently made to have it transferred to the American section, but it was unsuccessful.

The House mace was a bundle of tied reeds topped with a [[bald eagle]], an American symbol.]]\n[[File:Gilbert Stuart - George Washington (detail of book labels) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Detail of the book bindings in the White House's copy of the Lansdowne portrait. \"UNITED STATES\" is spelled as \"UNITED SATES\" to distinguish the copy.]]\nThe painting is full of symbolism, drawn from American and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] symbols of the [[Roman Republic]]. Stuart painted Washington from life, showing him standing up, dressed in a black [[velvet]] suit with an outstretched hand held up in an [[Eloquence|oratorical]] manner. Behind Washington is a row of two [[Doric column]]s, with another row to the left. Wrapped around and between the columns are red tasseled drapes.\n\nWashington's suit is plain and simple, and the [[sword]] he holds on his left side is a dress sword and not a battle sword (symbolizing a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[form of government]], rather than a [[monarchy]] or [[military dictatorship]]). In the sky, storm clouds appear on the left while a [[rainbow]] appears on the right, signifying the [[American Revolutionary War]] giving way to the peace and prosperity of the new [[United States]] after the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. The medallion at the top of the chair shows the red, white, and blue colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].\n\nOn and under the tablecloth-draped table to the left are two [[book]]s: ''Federalist''&mdash;probably a reference to the ''[[Federalist Papers]]''&mdash;and ''Journal of Congress''&mdash;the ''[[Congressional Record]]''. Another five books are under the table: the three to the right are ''General Orders'', ''American Revolution'', and ''Constitutional Bylaws''&mdash;symbolizing Washington's leadership as [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Continental Army]] and [[President of the Continental Congress|president]] of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]].\n\nThe pen and paper on the table signify the [[rule of law]]. The table's leg is carved as a [[fasces]], a bundle of bound wooden rods that symbolized imperial [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[authority]] in ancient Rome. On the table is a [[silver]] [[inkwell]], emblazed with [[Coat of Arms of George Washington|George Washington's coat of arms]], which alludes to his signing of the Jay Treaty.<ref name=\"Lansdowne\"/>{{rp|172}} A white [[quill]] rests upon silver [[dog]]s, ancient symbols of [[loyalty]]. Behind these on the table is the President's large black [[hat]].\n\nWashington's unusually clenched [[facial expression]] comes from his famous [[Dentures|false teeth]]. [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]]'s [[marble]] [[sculpture]] of Washington shows a more natural expression. Stuart wrote: \"When I painted him [Washington], he had just had a set of false teeth inserted, which accounts for the constrained expression so noticeable about the mouth and lower part of the face ... Houdon's [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] does not suffer from this defect.\"\n\n==Alternate versions==\n===Constable-Hamilton portrait===\nStuart painted a 1797 seated portrait of Washington, based on the Lansdowne.

France was then at war with Great Britain, and despite his best efforts, Monroe could not convince the French government that this was a benign treaty and would not affect Franco-American relations. President Washington recalled Monroe, and nominated Pinckney as his successor. Pinckney was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in September 1796, and arrived in Paris in November.<br>The [[French Directory]] refused to accept Pinckney's credentials, and negotiations between the countries broke down when French officials demanded a substantial bribe to do so, in what became known as the [[XYZ Affair]].<br>Miles's theory is that Pinckney's copy of the Lansdowne portrait was intended as a diplomatic gift from the U.S. to France. Pinckney's deliberate humiliation and the suspension of diplomatic relations between the countries (for nearly 5 years) caused those plans (and the portrait) to be abandoned.<br>Supporting evidence for the diplomatic gift theory is that Pinckney later sought reimbursement from Secretary of State Timothy Pickering for the $500 that he had paid to Stuart for the portrait.<ref name=\"Miles lecture\"/>}} Pinckney paid for but never retrieved his copy of the portrait from Stuart's studio, and the artist seems to have resold it to Baker by December 1797.<ref name=\"Stretch\">Bonnie Barrett Stretch, \"The White House Washington, If Stuart Didn't Paint It, Who Did?\" ''ArtNews'', October 1, 2004.[http://www.artnews.com/2004/10/01/the-white-house-washington/]</ref>\n\n==Provenance==\n<blockquote>After the death of Lord Lansdowne, his pictures were sold by auction. The ''Washington'' was purchased by Samuel Williams, an English {{sic}} merchant, for $2,000. Williams subsequently became insolvent, and his creditors disposed of the ''Washington'' by a lottery. Forty tickets were sold, at fifty guineas each. The picture fell to Mr. J. Delaware Lewis, a nephew of Mr. William D. Lewis, of Philadelphia. But few Americans had ever seen the picture, and Mr. William D. Lewis, who was Chairman of the Committee on Art, obtained the loan of it from his nephew for the [[1876 Centennial Exposition|Centennial Exhibition]]. It was sent out with the loan collection from England, unpacked at [[Memorial Hall (Philadelphia)|Memorial Hall]], and hung up in the British section before its arrival was known to the Fine Arts Committee. An effort was subsequently made to have it transferred to the American section, but it was unsuccessful.

The House mace was a bundle of tied reeds topped with a [[bald eagle]], an American symbol.]]\n[[File:Gilbert Stuart - George Washington (detail of book labels) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Detail of the book bindings in the White House's copy of the Lansdowne portrait. \"UNITED STATES\" is spelled as \"UNITED SATES\" to distinguish the copy.]]\nThe painting is full of symbolism, drawn from American and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] symbols of the [[Roman Republic]]. Stuart painted Washington from life, showing him standing up, dressed in a black [[velvet]] suit with an outstretched hand held up in an [[Eloquence|oratorical]] manner. Behind Washington is a row of two [[Doric column]]s, with another row to the left. Wrapped around and between the columns are red tasseled drapes.\n\nWashington's suit is plain and simple, and the [[sword]] he holds on his left side is a dress sword and not a battle sword (symbolizing a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[form of government]], rather than a [[monarchy]] or [[military dictatorship]]). In the sky, storm clouds appear on the left while a [[rainbow]] appears on the right, signifying the [[American Revolutionary War]] giving way to the peace and prosperity of the new [[United States]] after the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. The medallion at the top of the chair shows the red, white, and blue colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].\n\nOn and under the tablecloth-draped table to the left are two [[book]]s: ''Federalist''&mdash;probably a reference to the ''[[Federalist Papers]]''&mdash;and ''Journal of Congress''&mdash;the ''[[Congressional Record]]''. Another five books are under the table: the three to the right are ''General Orders'', ''American Revolution'', and ''Constitutional Bylaws''&mdash;symbolizing Washington's leadership as [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Continental Army]] and [[President of the Continental Congress|president]] of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]].\n\nThe pen and paper on the table signify the [[rule of law]]. The table's leg is carved as a [[fasces]], a bundle of bound wooden rods that symbolized imperial [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[authority]] in ancient Rome. On the table is a [[silver]] [[inkwell]], emblazed with [[Coat of Arms of George Washington|George Washington's coat of arms]], which alludes to his signing of the Jay Treaty.<ref name=\"Lansdowne\"/>{{rp|172}} A white [[quill]] rests upon silver [[dog]]s, ancient symbols of [[loyalty]]. Behind these on the table is the President's large black [[hat]].\n\nWashington's unusually clenched [[facial expression]] comes from his famous [[Dentures|false teeth]]. [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]]'s [[marble]] [[sculpture]] of Washington shows a more natural expression. Stuart wrote: \"When I painted him [Washington], he had just had a set of false teeth inserted, which accounts for the constrained expression so noticeable about the mouth and lower part of the face ... Houdon's [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] does not suffer from this defect.\"\n\n==Alternate versions==\n===Constable-Hamilton portrait===\nStuart painted a 1797 seated portrait of Washington, based on the Lansdowne.

Its 48.9% of the vote and total of 771,354 popular votes were its best in Wales since [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]].\n\nThe Conservative Party, who entered the campaign with high hopes of making gains, saw its representation reduced back to the levels it won in the 2010 general election.\n\nPlaid Cymru won back Ceredigion after the constituency's 12 years in Liberal Democrat hands, and brought its tally up to four seats, which was its best result showing since 2001 and one of its joint best in history.\n\nPlaid Cymru's gain in Ceredigion and the Liberal Democrats' failure to make gains elsewhere meant that this was the first time in Welsh electoral history where there were no Liberal or Liberal Democrat MPs elected to represent a Welsh constituency in a Westminster Parliamentary election.\n\n==Target seats==\n\n===Labour===\n*[[Gower (UK Parliament constituency)|Gower]], Conservative, 0.1% ('''Labour Gain''')\n*[[Vale of Clwyd (UK Parliament constituency)|Vale of Clwyd]], Conservative, 0.7% ('''Labour Gain''')\n*[[Cardiff North (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff North]], Conservative, 4.2% ('''Labour Gain''')\n\n===Conservative===\n*[[Bridgend (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridgend]], Labour, 4.9% (Labour Hold) \n*[[Wrexham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wrexham]], Labour, 5.6% (Labour Hold) \n*[[Clwyd South (UK Parliament constituency)|Clwyd South]], Labour, 6.9% (Labour Hold) \n*[[Delyn (UK Parliament constituency)|Delyn]], Labour, 7.8% (Labour Hold) \n*[[Alyn and Deeside (UK Parliament constituency)|Alyn and Deeside]], Labour, 8.1% (Labour Hold) \n*[[Newport West (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport West]], Labour, 8.7% (Labour Hold)\n\n===Plaid Cymru===\n*[[Ynys M\u00f4n (UK Parliament constituency)|Ynys M\u00f4n]], Labour, 0.7% (Labour Hold)\n*[[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion]], Liberal Democrats, 8.2% ('''Plaid Gain''')\n\n==Opinion polling==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:85%;line-height:14px\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Date(s)<br />conducted\n! style=\"width:230px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Polling organisation/client\n! style=\"width:65px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Sample size\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[Welsh Labour Party|Lab]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[Welsh Conservative Party|Con]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[Plaid Cymru|Plaid]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[Welsh Liberal Democrats|Lib Dem]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[Wales Green Party|Green]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"| Others\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:20px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Lead\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background:{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}};

Its 48.9% of the vote and total of 771,354 popular votes were its best in Wales since [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]].\n\nThe Conservative Party, who entered the campaign with high hopes of making gains, saw its representation reduced back to the levels it won in the 2010 general election.\n\nPlaid Cymru won back Ceredigion after the constituency's 12 years in Liberal Democrat hands, and brought its tally up to four seats, which was its best result showing since 2001 and one of its joint best in history.\n\nPlaid Cymru's gain in Ceredigion and the Liberal Democrats' failure to make gains elsewhere meant that this was the first time in Welsh electoral history where there were no Liberal or Liberal Democrat MPs elected to represent a Welsh constituency in a Westminster Parliamentary election.\n\n==Target seats==\n\n===Labour===\n*[[Gower (UK Parliament constituency)|Gower]], Conservative, 0.1% ('''Labour Gain''')\n*[[Vale of Clwyd (UK Parliament constituency)|Vale of Clwyd]], Conservative, 0.7% ('''Labour Gain''')\n*[[Cardiff North (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff North]], Conservative, 4.2% ('''Labour Gain''')\n\n===Conservative===\n*[[Bridgend (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridgend]], Labour, 4.9% (Labour Hold) \n*[[Wrexham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wrexham]], Labour, 5.6% (Labour Hold) \n*[[Clwyd South (UK Parliament constituency)|Clwyd South]], Labour, 6.9% (Labour Hold) \n*[[Delyn (UK Parliament constituency)|Delyn]], Labour, 7.8% (Labour Hold) \n*[[Alyn and Deeside (UK Parliament constituency)|Alyn and Deeside]], Labour, 8.1% (Labour Hold) \n*[[Newport West (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport West]], Labour, 8.7% (Labour Hold)\n\n===Plaid Cymru===\n*[[Ynys M\u00f4n (UK Parliament constituency)|Ynys M\u00f4n]], Labour, 0.7% (Labour Hold)\n*[[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion]], Liberal Democrats, 8.2% ('''Plaid Gain''')\n\n==Opinion polling==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:85%;line-height:14px\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Date(s)<br />conducted\n! style=\"width:230px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Polling organisation/client\n! style=\"width:65px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Sample size\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[Welsh Labour Party|Lab]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[Welsh Conservative Party|Con]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[Plaid Cymru|Plaid]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[Welsh Liberal Democrats|Lib Dem]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| [[Wales Green Party|Green]]\n! style=\"width:60px;\" rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"| Others\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:20px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Lead\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background:{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}};
