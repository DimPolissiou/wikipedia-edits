Its mission is to guard and protect the sovereignty of [[Bulgaria]]n airspace, to provide aerial support and to assist the Land Forces in case of war. The Bulgarian Air Force is one of the oldest [[air force]]s in [[Europe]] and the world. In recent times it has been actively taking part in numerous [[NATO]] missions and [[military exercise|exercises]] in [[Europe]].\nThe current commanding officer of the Bulgarian Air Force is [[Major General]] Tsanko Stoychev.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Masl.jpg|left|thumb|Boris Maslennikov's airplane in flight, Sofia 1910]]\n\nThe Bulgarian Air Force dates back to the end of the 19th century. At the 1892 [[Plovdiv International Fair]], two lieutenants of the [[Bulgarian Army]] flew in the 'La France' [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] owned by the Frenchman [[Eug\u00e8ne Godard]].<ref name=bulg1>Nedialkov, D. \"Air Power of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Part I\"</ref> Later, inspired by the flight, they succeeded in convincing the Bulgarian General Staff that the Army should build a balloon force. Despite numerous refusals from military schools around Europe who would not teach Bulgarian officers to use airships, eventually the Imperial Aviation School in [[St. Petersburg]] enrolled Lieutenant Vasil Zlatarov as a student. On 20 April 1906 \"Vazduhoplavatelno Otdelenie\" (roughly translated as Aviation Squad) was created to operate observation balloons for the Army, initially as a part of Railway Battalion.<ref name=bulg1/> After graduation Lt. Zlatarov was appointed its first commander. After operating small balloons, in 1911 a bigger Godard balloon was bought, and in 1912 the first indigenous balloon, Sofia-1, was constructed in Bulgaria using materials bought from [[Russia]].<ref name=bulg1/>\n\nIn 1910 a Russian aircraft engineer, Boris Maslennikov, was invited to [[Bulgaria]], where he presented his airplane, a modification of the French [[Farman III]]. Following his demonstration, assisted by Vasil Zlatarov over the hippodrome in [[Sofia]], the Bulgarian Government decided to acquire airplanes for The Aviation Corps. In early 1912 thirteen army officers were sent abroad for training as pilots and orders were placed for five French, British and German airplanes.<ref name=bulg1/> The officers sent to France completed their training first and returned to Bulgaria in July 1912. The same year Bulgaria received its first airplane \u2013 a [[Bleriot XXI]], which Simeon Petrov flew on 13 August 1912 to become the first Bulgarian to pilot an airplane over Bulgaria.<ref name=bulg1/>\n\n===First and Second Balkan Wars===\n[[File:Bleriot XI - Simeon Petrov.jpg|right|thumb|[[Simon Petrov]] in a Bleriot XI 1912]]\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]], Bulgarian pilots still abroad hastily procured aircraft to be shipped home after them and foreign volunteer pilots converged from all over Europe to fly for Bulgaria.<ref name=\"aeroflight.co.uk\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/bulgaria/af/bulgaf_narrative_history.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019132330/http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/bulgaria/af/bulgaf_narrative_history.htm |archive-date=19 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> After the front lines had stabilized, an Aeroplane Platoon was established at a new airfield close to the fighting.<ref name=\"aeroflight.co.uk\"/>\n\nIntelligence about the [[Turkish army]] strength and dispositions in the [[Edirne]] was required, and on [[1912 in aviation|16 October 1912]], two aviators performed a reconnaissance flight over the city in an [[Farman III|Albatros F.2]] biplane, also dropping two bombs. This was not only the first military mission performed by a Bulgarian aircraft, but also the first combat use of an aircraft in Europe and one of the first bombing attacks.<ref name=bulg1/><ref>Rajlich, Boshniakov and Mandjukov, 2002, p.68</ref>\n\nLater that month the Bulgarian Aviation Corps was expanded to three Aeroplane Platoons. Foreign volunteers began flying operational sorties alongside Bulgarian pilots and carried out [[reconnaissance]], leaflet-dropping and bombing missions. During the war at least three aircraft were shot down. Considerable help was received from the Russians in terms of aircraft, maintenance and training. Due to low aircraft serviceability and frequent accidents, the number of missions flown was relatively low. Despite that, the Bulgarian airmen and their foreign allies were able to gather enough intelligence for the Army General Staff to help successfully capture of the city after a long [[Siege of Adrianople (1912\u201313)|siege]]. Although inflicting little physical damage, the bombs had a devastating effect on the defending Turkish garrison's morale and played a crucial part in the fall of the city, which was until then considered nearly impregnable.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\nDuring the First Balkan War Bulgarian aviation undertook 70 combat sorties, including 11 bombing raids, during the Second Balkan War it undertook 6 sorties.<ref name=bulg1/> All in all, during both wars, there were over 230 aircraft sorties, including non-combat flights.<ref name=bulg1/> In addition to the Albatros F.2, Bulgaria flew [[Bl\u00e9riot XI]] and [[Bl\u00e9riot XXI|XXI]], [[Bristol Prier monoplane|Bristol Prier]], Farman VII and [[Nieuport IV]] aircraft, as well as examples provided by Sommer and Voisin.<ref name=bulg1/>\n\n===World War I (1914\u20131918)===\n====Army air action====\nThe [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] entered [[World War I]] as an ally of the [[Central Powers]] on 4 October 1915. The Aeroplane Section of the Bulgarian Army was reformed with assistance from Germany and Austria.<ref>Wragg, 2002, p.21</ref> Aircraft were deployed to [[Kumanovo]] Airfield in support of advancing Bulgarian forces, but bad weather initially prevented any flying. Until then they had completed 11 combat sorties from an airfield in [[Sofia]] (now the central railway station).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} As the frontline advanced, the unit re-deployed to airfields near Belitsa and [[Xanthi]], in modern [[Greece]]. Newly acquired German [[LVG]] aircraft were hastily pressed into action.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Two more airfields were constructed near Udovo and Levunovo. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] began flying reconnaissance and bomber sorties against Bulgarian units on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Southern Balkan Front]]. Throughout World War I Bulgarian military aviation experienced a steady increase in both numbers and quality of aircraft; however, they remained inferior to those flown by the Allies, especially the British and French. The First Aeroplane Section (the country's only aircraft unit) was attached to the Second Bulgarian Army. It flew 255 sorties compared to 397 flown by the four squadrons of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] it opposed, and operated the following types:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n* 12 [[LVG B.II]] \u2013 reconnaissance aircraft, the first group of six arriving in November 1915. Those two seaters were also used as fighters by the Bulgarians, as dedicated \"scouts\" were not available.\n* 13 [[Otto C.I]] \u2013 a twin-tailed pusher bomber. The first Otto in arrived in May 1916.\n* 18 [[Albatros C.III]] \u2013 reconnaissance aircraft, also used as trainers. First delivery in August 1916.\n* 12 [[DFW C.V]] \u2013 reconnaissance aircraft, first arrived in August 1917.\n* 6 [[Roland D.II]] fighters. During July 1917 the first of these arrived with the Section.\n* 6 [[Roland D.III]] fighters, the first arriving at the end of 1917.\n* 3 [[Fokker E.III]] fighters, first of these delivered in the spring of 1916.\n* 8 [[Fokker D.VII]] \u2013 the best fighter used by Bulgaria in World War I. Delivery took place in September 1918 and they saw no action. 7 were scrapped in accordance with the peace treaty. The 8th flew as a two-seater after the war.\n* 2 [[Albatros C.I]]. These were ordered by the Ottoman Empire before Bulgaria entered the war. During early 1915 a couple landed on then neutral Bulgarian territory after a navigational error, and they were seized.\n\nIn addition, the Bulgarian Navy used the following airplanes:\n* 8 [[Friedrichshafen FF.33]] floatplane bombers, starting in 1916\n* 2 [[Rumpler 6B|Rumpler 6B1]] floatplane fighters, starting in 1916\n\nA number of Bulgarian pilots flew with German air units at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and at Xanthi. They operated several types, including the [[Albatros D.III]] and Halberstadt, which would later mistakenly be listed on the Bulgarian inventory by some sources.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=====Captured Allied aircraft=====\n[[File:Armstrong-Whitworth FK3 captured.jpg|thumb|left|Bulgarian airmen in captured British [[Armstrong Whitworth FK.3]]]]\nOn 30 September 1916 a French [[Farman F.40]] bomber of Escadrille 384 was tasked with attacking the Bulgarian capital, [[Sofia]]. Two Bulgarian [[Fokker E.III]]s were positioned south of Sofia to intercept the intruder, while a flight of three armed Albatros C.III two-seat trainers covered the center of the city as backup. The bomber successfully dropped its bombs over Sofia while escaping anti-aircraft fire but, while departing, was attacked by the Bulgarian Fokkers, one piloted by Marko Parvanov, which brought the Farman down with a dead engine.<ref>Nedialkov, 2001</ref>\n\nAnother Allied aircraft, a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Armstrong Whitworth F.K.3]], was captured by Bulgarian troops on 12 February 1917 after engine problems forced it to land. Both it and the crew were captured. It would receive Bulgarian insignia and be used to bomb Allied positions at night. Four such sorties were flown before being shot down on 23 May 1918.<ref>Tapper, 1973, p.57</ref>\n\nA [[Nieuport 24bis]] and a [[Nieuport 27]] were also captured. Lieutenant Vladimir Balan, a Bulgarian fighter pilot who had been flying with a German Jasta on the Western Front, was flying one of the Nieuports when he shot down the squadron leader of [[No. 17 Squadron RAF]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Naval air action====\nBulgarian naval aviators also played an important role in the air war. In 1912 [[Petty-Officer]]s Lyapchev and Mikhailov were sent, along with other officers and seamen, to the German naval aviation forming facilities for training. Another group of naval personnel followed in the beginning of the First World War. Training was held at List, Nordenhai and Kiel. In November 1915 a [[seaplane station]] under German control was established near [[Varna]], initially operating four Friedrichshafen FF.33 bombers and a Rumpler 6B1 fighter. Later, at the coast of the Varna Lake, a second [[seaplane]] station was built (this one under Bulgarian control), operating the same inventory. Near [[Sozopol]] a forward fuel and ammunition replenishment base was established in support of patrol flights over the southern Bulgarian coastline. At the end of 1917 the German station was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy. At the time of the armistice the Bulgarian fleet air arm comprised two seaplane stations, a forward replenishment base, three hangars, three workshops, ammunition warehouses and 10 seaplanes. After the cease-fire the machines were used for mine reconnaissance. At the end of 1919 they are transported by train to [[Bozhurishte]] Airfield to be scrapped along with the army aviation inventory.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Bulgarian balloon observers also took part in the war. They were most active on the [[Dobruja|Dobrudzha]] Front, where aircraft activities were scarce (a German bomber squadron, flying missions against [[Bucharest]] and [[Constan\u0163a]]: \"Gotha\" bombers accounted for the most flights). Near the Bulgarian city of [[Yambol]] an [[airship hangar]] was constructed to house German airships. The airship Sch\u00fctte-Lanz SL 10 was the first to use it. According to documents of the time it was assigned to the Bulgarian Army, but was actually under German control. It was lost during a flight over the [[Black Sea]] in July 1916. In August 1916 the LZ 101 replaced it. After performing raids on targets in Romania and Greece it returned to Germany in August 1917. In November 1917 the naval airship [[Zeppelin LZ104|L 59]] arrived. That airship flew a series of remarkable missions, such as an attempted resupply of the garrison in the colony [[German East Africa]] and the bombing of [[Naples]] and [[Port Said]]. During a mission against the British naval base in [[Malta]], a lightning strike over the [[Mediterranean Sea]] set it alight and completely destroyed it. All hands were lost.<ref name=\"Fallschirmjaeger\">Rumen Kirilov, Ivan Borislavov, \"The Bulgarian Aviation in the Chains of the Neuilly Peace Treaty\", in: \"Klub Krile Magazine\", special, Vol. 11, 1999, \"Air Group 2000\" Publishing, Sofia, Bulgaria</ref>\n\n===Destruction and survival under the peace treaty (1919\u20131936)===\nOn 4 October 1918 the Bulgarian Tsar issued a Royal Act of Demobilization. This resulted in military aviation being converted to its peacetime structure.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The Aeroplane group, based in Bozhurishte comprised the following: \n* Two aeroplane companies\n* An aeroplane school\n* An aeroplane atelli\u00e9r\n* An aeroplane depot\nThe Chaika Naval Seaplane station at Varna was under Naval command.\n\nOn 27 November 1919 the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]] was signed. In accordance with the [[treaty]] the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] was banned from operating [[military aircraft]] under any form for the next 20 years. All Bulgarian airplanes, balloons, aviation equipment, weaponry and ammunition were to be destroyed under Allied control and all personnel demobilised.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Bulgarian Treaty|journal=Flight|volume=11|number=39|date=September 1919|page=1284|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201282.html|accessdate=16 May 2019}}</ref> Under the terms of the treaty any aircraft procured for civilian purposes had to be bought from the countries on the winning side. The combined engine power for any airplane (including multi-engined ones) was not to exceed 180&nbsp;hp. In addition, the Bulgarian airspace was to be controlled by the allies and used according to the victorious countries' interests.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn accordance with the treaty during 1920 no less than 70 [[airplanes]], 110 [[aircraft engines]], 3 air balloons, 76 [[machine guns]], a number of photographic [[camera]]s and other aviation equipment were destroyed at the [[military airfield]] of Bozhurishte. The [[seaplanes]] of the [[Bulgarian Navy]] were delivered by train to the same airfield and scrapped soon after that.\n\n[[File:Dar10.jpg|thumb|right|A Bulgarian-manufactured [[DAR-10]] training plane. DAR produced small numbers of locally designed aircraft]]\n\nDue to the devotion of the Air Troops personnel and the help of the population of the surrounding villages, several aircraft were hidden, thus evading Allied inspection following destruction. Seven DFW C.V, Albatros C.III and a single Fokker D.VII were among the survivors. In addition, at least ten aviation engines ([[Benz Bz.IV]] and [[Mercedes D.III]]) were also saved.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Bulgarian government tried to get around the ban for military flight activity by establishing a Gendarmery Aeroplane Section in 1919. Since the Gendarmery was at that time a service under the Ministry of War, the creation of the unit was met by fierce opposition by the Allied commission. This almost resulted in the destruction of the whole [[Sofia Airport|Vrazhdebna Airfield]], but the disbandment of the unit prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAn Aeroflight Section under the Ministry of [[Railway]]s, [[Postal Service]] and [[Telegraph]] was created in 1920. Bulgarian aviation personnel assembled two airplanes from hidden spares and parts, salvaged from the destroyed military airplanes. The two aircraft, known as \"the mixed planes\", recorded about 1000 flight hours altogether. The sole remaining Bulgarian Fokker D.VII was disguised as a two-seater, thus being classified as a trainer and returning to active service.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn 5 July 1923 Bulgaria ratified the International Civil Aviation Treaty. From that moment on its air vehicles would carry a registration in the form B-B??? (the latter three signs being a combination of capital letters). In 1923 the first group of cadets, called \"student-flyers\" entered the Flying school at Vrazhdebna AF.\n\nThe following year (1924) the first new airplanes were acquired. Those were machines of the [[Potez VIII]], [[Caudron C.59]], Henriot XD.14 and Bristol 29 Tourer types; [[Avro 522]] seaplanes were also procured. During the same year the Bulgarian airplane construction specialist Atanas Grigorov (who obtained his qualification at the \"Albatroswerke \u2013 Berlin\") assembled his seaplane, called \"Grigorov-1\". The aircraft made several test-flights, recording excellent characteristics, but was damaged beyond repair by a storm in the hangar where it was stationed. Also in 1924 the Aeroplane Section was expanded to an Aeroflight Directorate still under the Ministry of Railways, Postal Service and Telegraph.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n1925 saw the [[Potez XVII]], [[Bristol Primary Trainer|Bristol Lucifer]] and [[Alenia Aermacchi|Macchi]] 2000/18 flying boat boosting the country's aircraft inventory. The Bulgarian government invited a group of German aircraft engineers, headed by the constructor Herr Hermann Winter to help establish an aviation factory. Named The State's Aeroconstruction Atelli\u00e9r or [[Darzhavna Aeroplanna Rabotilnitsa]] (DAR) the factory was initially managed by the first Bulgarian pilot to achieve an aerial victory \u2013 Mr. Marko Parvanov. The first aircraft types produced at the plant were the U-1 or \"Uzounov-1\" (an indigenous variant of the wartime German DFW C.V) and the [[DAR 2]] (an indigenous variant of the German [[Albatros C.III]] of the same era). Both types became well-known and loved by the personnel of the former Air Troops and gained Bulgarian combat service experience.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Development of a new type \u2013 the [[DAR 1]] \u2013 was also started.\n\n[[File:Stele-Plovdiv.jpg|thumb|right|One of the eagles that decorated the entrance of [[Bozhurishte Air Base]] in the 1930s and 1940s, now preserved at the [[Plovdiv Museum of Aviation]]]]\n\nDuring the course of 1926 the Airplane School was moved to the geographical center of the country. The town of [[Kazanlak]] was well suited, for it was far away from the Allied Control Commission. The [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] company [[Aero Vodochody]] also built an aircraft factory near that city, but its models were not up to the requirements of the Bulgarian authorities. After an unsuccessful switch to automotive production, the plant was finally sold to the Italian [[Caproni]] company. The factory became popular as \"Balgarski Kaproni\" or \"Bulgarian Caproni\". The first examples of the DAR 1 biplane were produced and entered service with the Aeroflight Directorate during 1926.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe 1927 structure of the Directorate was the following:\n* A fighter yato,<ref group=\"NOTE\">The Bulgarian word \"yato\" means a \"flock of birds\" and was the Bulgarian equivalent of an air force squadron at the time</ref> flying the DAR 1\n* A bomber yato, flying the DAR U-1 and DAR 2\n* A recon yato, flying the Potez XVII\n* A seaplane yato, flying Avro 522 floatplanes and Macchi 2000/18 flying boats\n* An aeroplane school, flying the [[Caudron C.59]], the [[Hanriot HD.14]] and the \u0160molnik \u0160.18\n\nIn 1928 the Ministry of War started the ambitious 10-year program for development of the military aviation (still banned by the peace treaty). According to the plan the following structure had to be achieved:\n* 4 army fighter orlyaks,<ref group=\"NOTE\">The Bulgarian word \"orlyak\" used here means a \"Air Group\"</ref> each made of two yatos, or overall 8 yatos flying 96 fighter planes\n* 4 army recon orlyaks, each made of two yatos, or overall 8 yatos flying 96 recon planes\n* 18 divisionary recon yatos, basically air support aviation, each flying 12 planes or 216 planes altogether\n* Strike Aviation Brigade with:\n** Fighter Orlyak of 48 machines\n** Bomber Orlyak of 36 machines\n** Recon Orlyak of 2 machines\n* Maritime Orlyak\n** 2 seaplane fighter yatos, flying 24 fighters\n** 2 seaplane bomber yatos, flying 18 bombers\n\nIn 1931 Bulgaria signed the Warsaw Treaty, concerning international civil air activities and the country was assigned the new civil registration \u2013 LZ-??? (the latter three signs being a combination of capital letters). In 1933 the Bulgarian Council of Ministers approved the following wartime order of battle of the aviation:\n* a mixed orlyak of:\n** a fighter yato\n** a bomber yato\n** a recon yato\n** a liaison and photographic survey yato\n* a maritime yato\n* a training orlyak\n* a Pilot School at Kazanlak airfield\n* a balloon company (which was never actually created, as the balloon was considered obsolete for military purposes at the time).\nBulgaria started acquiring German, Czechoslovak and Polish airplanes.\n\nIn 1934 the Aviation Regiment was renamed His Majesty's Air Troops, comprising a headquarters, with two army orlyaks (based at [[Bozhurishte]] and [[Plovdiv]] airfields), a training orlyak (in [[Plovdiv]]), a maritime yato (at NAS Chaika, Varna) and additional operational support units. Colonel Ivan Mikhailov was appointed the first chief of the air force with Lieutenant-Colonel Georgi Vasilev appointed as his Deputy.<ref name=\"Fallschirmjaeger\"/>\n\n===Years of Rebirth (1937\u20131939)===\n[[File:Roundel of Bulgaria (1937-1941).svg|right|thumb|160px|Insignia from 1937 to 1941, also the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Bulgaria|Medal of Bravery]]]]\n\nThe first combat aircraft that entered service in the reestablished air force in 1937 were 12 [[Arado Ar 65]] fighters, 12 [[Heinkel He 51]] fighters, 12 [[Dornier Do 11]] bombers and 12 [[Heinkel He 45]]B reconnaissance aircraft.

Each orlyak had a fighter, a line bomber and two reconnaissance yatos (Squadrons). There was also an Independent Aviation corps, which combined the 5th Bomber and 6th Fighter Regiments. The training units consisted of the \"Junker\" School Orlyak at [[Vrazhdebna]] airfield, the 2nd Training Orlyak at Telish airfield (called the Blind Flying Training School) and the 3rd Training Orlyak at [[Stara Zagora]] airfield. In 1940, the Bulgarian aviation industry provided the air force with 42 [[DAR 9 Siniger]] and 45 [[Caproni Ca.113|Kaproni-Bulgarski KB-5 Chuchuliga]] aircraft, along with preparing for serial production of the [[Caproni Ca.309|KB-6]] \u2013 Bulgaria's first twin-engined aircraft.

At the Black Sea shores the \"Galata\" Fighter Orlyak was established at [[NAS Chaika]], [[Varna]], with the 10 Bf 109E-4s and 6 Avia B.534s. The S.328s were also used for anti-submarine patrols over the [[Black Sea]], flying out of the [[Sarafovo]] and [[Balchik]] airfields. At the end of 1941 the inventory of His Majesty's Air Troops consisted of 609 aircraft of 40 different types.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn 22 June 1941, [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded the Soviet Union]], but Bulgaria refused to take part, although it did declare war with Great Britain and the United States of America in December 1941. Bulgaria's inaction against the Soviet Union meant that supplies of German aircraft slowed to a trickle, with only four aircraft delivered from January to September 1942.<ref name=\"apap72 p141\">Bateson, April 1972, p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe war declared by the Kingdom of Bulgaria against the US and Great Britain was a tragedy for the little country. The city of Sofia and Bulgarian towns and villages were hit by air strikes in late 1943 and in 1944. In all, 187 inhabited places were attacked, 45,000 destructive and incendiary bombs were dropped. There were about 2,000 casualties, and about 4700 wounded, 12,000 damaged or ruined buildings and the total losses were estimated at nearly 24 billion dollars. For the citizens of Sofia, the \"Black\" days were 14 and 24 November, 10 and 20 December 1943, and 10 January and 16, 24, 30 March and 17 April 1944 when large formations of [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] and B-24 bombers ruined parts of the capital city including the central area. The Bulgarians also see successes. On 1 August 1943, an enormous armada of about 700 American [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers flew over several Balkan countries their way to bomb \"the taproot of German might\", the giant oil refineries at [[Ploie\u0219ti]], Romania.<ref>Dugan and Stewart, 2002, pp. 202-203; Stout, 2011, pp. 68-70, 180\u2013185</ref> Termed [[Operation Tidal Wave]], the aircraft flew over Bulgarian territory and Bulgarian fighter pilots Sub-lieutenant Peter Bochev (5 victories), Captain Tschudomir Toplodolski (4 victories), Lieutenant Stoyan Stoyanov (5 victories) and Sublieutenant Hristo Krastev (1 victory) inflicted heavy losses on the bombers.<ref>Rajlich, Boshniakov and Mandjukov, 2002, p. 75</ref>\n\nIn total, about 23,000 enemy sorties were registered over Bulgaria in the years 1943\u20131944.

The force expanded rapidly with deliveries of different types of combat aircraft. The first shipments of Soviet equipment arrived immediately after the end of World War II, mostly consisting of propeller-driven aircraft, such as the [[Ilyushin Il-2]] (120 Il-2 and 10 Il-2U), the [[Ilyushin Il-10]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-2]].

The MiG-21s in service were scheduled to be replaced with possible American or European aircraft. \nOn 11 November 2016, the Bulgarian government signed a 21.8-million euro contract for 10 MiG-29 engines (four new and six repaired), with the first pair scheduled to arrive by April 2017. The deal would eventually bring the number of active service MiG-29 aircraft from 9 to 14, as Bulgaria also announced it was looking to overhaul the fleet and buy eight new or second-hand fighter jets during the coming year. <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-defence-idUSKBN1351ND |title=Bulgaria signs deal to buy 10 Russian engines for aging fleet (Reuters, November 11, 2016) |access-date=2 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305001333/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-defence-idUSKBN1351ND |archive-date=5 March 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref>As of January 2020, the Bulgarian government has plans to aquire the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16V Block 70]] aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.flightglobal.com/fixed-wing/bulgarian-parliament-clears-f-16v-buy-for-second-time/133717.article |title= Bulgarian parliament clears F-16V buy for second time |publisher= flightglobal.com |date=|accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref>\n=== Current inventory ===\n[[File:Bulgarian mig-29 (altered).jpg|thumb|right|A MiG-29A in flight]]\n[[File:Bulgarian Air Force Airbus A319 Milinkovic.jpg|thumb|right|Bulgaria's Presidential flight]]\n[[File:Bulgarian Air Force Mil Mi-17 Lofting-2.jpg|thumb|right|A Bulgarian Mi-17 on lift off]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align:center;

Its mission is to guard and protect the sovereignty of [[Bulgaria]]n airspace, to provide aerial support and to assist the Land Forces in case of war. The Bulgarian Air Force is one of the oldest [[air force]]s in [[Europe]] and the world. In recent times it has been actively taking part in numerous [[NATO]] missions and [[military exercise|exercises]] in [[Europe]].\nThe current commanding officer of the Bulgarian Air Force is [[Major General]] Tsanko Stoychev.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Masl.jpg|left|thumb|Boris Maslennikov's airplane in flight, Sofia 1910]]\n\nThe Bulgarian Air Force dates back to the end of the 19th century. At the 1892 [[Plovdiv International Fair]], two lieutenants of the [[Bulgarian Army]] flew in the 'La France' [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] owned by the Frenchman [[Eug\u00e8ne Godard]].<ref name=bulg1>Nedialkov, D. \"Air Power of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Part I\"</ref> Later, inspired by the flight, they succeeded in convincing the Bulgarian General Staff that the Army should build a balloon force. Despite numerous refusals from military schools around Europe who would not teach Bulgarian officers to use airships, eventually the Imperial Aviation School in [[St. Petersburg]] enrolled Lieutenant Vasil Zlatarov as a student. On 20 April 1906 \"Vazduhoplavatelno Otdelenie\" (roughly translated as Aviation Squad) was created to operate observation balloons for the Army, initially as a part of Railway Battalion.<ref name=bulg1/> After graduation Lt. Zlatarov was appointed its first commander. After operating small balloons, in 1911 a bigger Godard balloon was bought, and in 1912 the first indigenous balloon, Sofia-1, was constructed in Bulgaria using materials bought from [[Russia]].<ref name=bulg1/>\n\nIn 1910 a Russian aircraft engineer, Boris Maslennikov, was invited to [[Bulgaria]], where he presented his airplane, a modification of the French [[Farman III]]. Following his demonstration, assisted by Vasil Zlatarov over the hippodrome in [[Sofia]], the Bulgarian Government decided to acquire airplanes for The Aviation Corps. In early 1912 thirteen army officers were sent abroad for training as pilots and orders were placed for five French, British and German airplanes.<ref name=bulg1/> The officers sent to France completed their training first and returned to Bulgaria in July 1912. The same year Bulgaria received its first airplane \u2013 a [[Bleriot XXI]], which Simeon Petrov flew on 13 August 1912 to become the first Bulgarian to pilot an airplane over Bulgaria.<ref name=bulg1/>\n\n===First and Second Balkan Wars===\n[[File:Bleriot XI - Simeon Petrov.jpg|right|thumb|[[Simon Petrov]] in a Bleriot XI 1912]]\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]], Bulgarian pilots still abroad hastily procured aircraft to be shipped home after them and foreign volunteer pilots converged from all over Europe to fly for Bulgaria.<ref name=\"aeroflight.co.uk\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/bulgaria/af/bulgaf_narrative_history.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019132330/http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/bulgaria/af/bulgaf_narrative_history.htm |archive-date=19 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> After the front lines had stabilized, an Aeroplane Platoon was established at a new airfield close to the fighting.<ref name=\"aeroflight.co.uk\"/>\n\nIntelligence about the [[Turkish army]] strength and dispositions in the [[Edirne]] was required, and on [[1912 in aviation|16 October 1912]], two aviators performed a reconnaissance flight over the city in an [[Farman III|Albatros F.2]] biplane, also dropping two bombs. This was not only the first military mission performed by a Bulgarian aircraft, but also the first combat use of an aircraft in Europe and one of the first bombing attacks.<ref name=bulg1/><ref>Rajlich, Boshniakov and Mandjukov, 2002, p.68</ref>\n\nLater that month the Bulgarian Aviation Corps was expanded to three Aeroplane Platoons. Foreign volunteers began flying operational sorties alongside Bulgarian pilots and carried out [[reconnaissance]], leaflet-dropping and bombing missions. During the war at least three aircraft were shot down. Considerable help was received from the Russians in terms of aircraft, maintenance and training. Due to low aircraft serviceability and frequent accidents, the number of missions flown was relatively low. Despite that, the Bulgarian airmen and their foreign allies were able to gather enough intelligence for the Army General Staff to help successfully capture of the city after a long [[Siege of Adrianople (1912\u201313)|siege]]. Although inflicting little physical damage, the bombs had a devastating effect on the defending Turkish garrison's morale and played a crucial part in the fall of the city, which was until then considered nearly impregnable.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\nDuring the First Balkan War Bulgarian aviation undertook 70 combat sorties, including 11 bombing raids, during the Second Balkan War it undertook 6 sorties.<ref name=bulg1/> All in all, during both wars, there were over 230 aircraft sorties, including non-combat flights.<ref name=bulg1/> In addition to the Albatros F.2, Bulgaria flew [[Bl\u00e9riot XI]] and [[Bl\u00e9riot XXI|XXI]], [[Bristol Prier monoplane|Bristol Prier]], Farman VII and [[Nieuport IV]] aircraft, as well as examples provided by Sommer and Voisin.<ref name=bulg1/>\n\n===World War I (1914\u20131918)===\n====Army air action====\nThe [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] entered [[World War I]] as an ally of the [[Central Powers]] on 4 October 1915. The Aeroplane Section of the Bulgarian Army was reformed with assistance from Germany and Austria.<ref>Wragg, 2002, p.21</ref> Aircraft were deployed to [[Kumanovo]] Airfield in support of advancing Bulgarian forces, but bad weather initially prevented any flying. Until then they had completed 11 combat sorties from an airfield in [[Sofia]] (now the central railway station).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} As the frontline advanced, the unit re-deployed to airfields near Belitsa and [[Xanthi]], in modern [[Greece]]. Newly acquired German [[LVG]] aircraft were hastily pressed into action.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Two more airfields were constructed near Udovo and Levunovo. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] began flying reconnaissance and bomber sorties against Bulgarian units on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Southern Balkan Front]]. Throughout World War I Bulgarian military aviation experienced a steady increase in both numbers and quality of aircraft; however, they remained inferior to those flown by the Allies, especially the British and French. The First Aeroplane Section (the country's only aircraft unit) was attached to the Second Bulgarian Army. It flew 255 sorties compared to 397 flown by the four squadrons of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] it opposed, and operated the following types:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n* 12 [[LVG B.II]] \u2013 reconnaissance aircraft, the first group of six arriving in November 1915. Those two seaters were also used as fighters by the Bulgarians, as dedicated \"scouts\" were not available.\n* 13 [[Otto C.I]] \u2013 a twin-tailed pusher bomber. The first Otto in arrived in May 1916.\n* 18 [[Albatros C.III]] \u2013 reconnaissance aircraft, also used as trainers. First delivery in August 1916.\n* 12 [[DFW C.V]] \u2013 reconnaissance aircraft, first arrived in August 1917.\n* 6 [[Roland D.II]] fighters. During July 1917 the first of these arrived with the Section.\n* 6 [[Roland D.III]] fighters, the first arriving at the end of 1917.\n* 3 [[Fokker E.III]] fighters, first of these delivered in the spring of 1916.\n* 8 [[Fokker D.VII]] \u2013 the best fighter used by Bulgaria in World War I. Delivery took place in September 1918 and they saw no action. 7 were scrapped in accordance with the peace treaty. The 8th flew as a two-seater after the war.\n* 2 [[Albatros C.I]]. These were ordered by the Ottoman Empire before Bulgaria entered the war. During early 1915 a couple landed on then neutral Bulgarian territory after a navigational error, and they were seized.\n\nIn addition, the Bulgarian Navy used the following airplanes:\n* 8 [[Friedrichshafen FF.33]] floatplane bombers, starting in 1916\n* 2 [[Rumpler 6B|Rumpler 6B1]] floatplane fighters, starting in 1916\n\nA number of Bulgarian pilots flew with German air units at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and at Xanthi. They operated several types, including the [[Albatros D.III]] and Halberstadt, which would later mistakenly be listed on the Bulgarian inventory by some sources.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=====Captured Allied aircraft=====\n[[File:Armstrong-Whitworth FK3 captured.jpg|thumb|left|Bulgarian airmen in captured British [[Armstrong Whitworth FK.3]]]]\nOn 30 September 1916 a French [[Farman F.40]] bomber of Escadrille 384 was tasked with attacking the Bulgarian capital, [[Sofia]]. Two Bulgarian [[Fokker E.III]]s were positioned south of Sofia to intercept the intruder, while a flight of three armed Albatros C.III two-seat trainers covered the center of the city as backup. The bomber successfully dropped its bombs over Sofia while escaping anti-aircraft fire but, while departing, was attacked by the Bulgarian Fokkers, one piloted by Marko Parvanov, which brought the Farman down with a dead engine.<ref>Nedialkov, 2001</ref>\n\nAnother Allied aircraft, a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Armstrong Whitworth F.K.3]], was captured by Bulgarian troops on 12 February 1917 after engine problems forced it to land. Both it and the crew were captured. It would receive Bulgarian insignia and be used to bomb Allied positions at night. Four such sorties were flown before being shot down on 23 May 1918.<ref>Tapper, 1973, p.57</ref>\n\nA [[Nieuport 24bis]] and a [[Nieuport 27]] were also captured. Lieutenant Vladimir Balan, a Bulgarian fighter pilot who had been flying with a German Jasta on the Western Front, was flying one of the Nieuports when he shot down the squadron leader of [[No. 17 Squadron RAF]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Naval air action====\nBulgarian naval aviators also played an important role in the air war. In 1912 [[Petty-Officer]]s Lyapchev and Mikhailov were sent, along with other officers and seamen, to the German naval aviation forming facilities for training. Another group of naval personnel followed in the beginning of the First World War. Training was held at List, Nordenhai and Kiel. In November 1915 a [[seaplane station]] under German control was established near [[Varna]], initially operating four Friedrichshafen FF.33 bombers and a Rumpler 6B1 fighter. Later, at the coast of the Varna Lake, a second [[seaplane]] station was built (this one under Bulgarian control), operating the same inventory. Near [[Sozopol]] a forward fuel and ammunition replenishment base was established in support of patrol flights over the southern Bulgarian coastline. At the end of 1917 the German station was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy. At the time of the armistice the Bulgarian fleet air arm comprised two seaplane stations, a forward replenishment base, three hangars, three workshops, ammunition warehouses and 10 seaplanes. After the cease-fire the machines were used for mine reconnaissance. At the end of 1919 they are transported by train to [[Bozhurishte]] Airfield to be scrapped along with the army aviation inventory.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Bulgarian balloon observers also took part in the war. They were most active on the [[Dobruja|Dobrudzha]] Front, where aircraft activities were scarce (a German bomber squadron, flying missions against [[Bucharest]] and [[Constan\u0163a]]: \"Gotha\" bombers accounted for the most flights). Near the Bulgarian city of [[Yambol]] an [[airship hangar]] was constructed to house German airships. The airship Sch\u00fctte-Lanz SL 10 was the first to use it. According to documents of the time it was assigned to the Bulgarian Army, but was actually under German control. It was lost during a flight over the [[Black Sea]] in July 1916. In August 1916 the LZ 101 replaced it. After performing raids on targets in Romania and Greece it returned to Germany in August 1917. In November 1917 the naval airship [[Zeppelin LZ104|L 59]] arrived. That airship flew a series of remarkable missions, such as an attempted resupply of the garrison in the colony [[German East Africa]] and the bombing of [[Naples]] and [[Port Said]]. During a mission against the British naval base in [[Malta]], a lightning strike over the [[Mediterranean Sea]] set it alight and completely destroyed it. All hands were lost.<ref name=\"Fallschirmjaeger\">Rumen Kirilov, Ivan Borislavov, \"The Bulgarian Aviation in the Chains of the Neuilly Peace Treaty\", in: \"Klub Krile Magazine\", special, Vol. 11, 1999, \"Air Group 2000\" Publishing, Sofia, Bulgaria</ref>\n\n===Destruction and survival under the peace treaty (1919\u20131936)===\nOn 4 October 1918 the Bulgarian Tsar issued a Royal Act of Demobilization. This resulted in military aviation being converted to its peacetime structure.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The Aeroplane group, based in Bozhurishte comprised the following: \n* Two aeroplane companies\n* An aeroplane school\n* An aeroplane atelli\u00e9r\n* An aeroplane depot\nThe Chaika Naval Seaplane station at Varna was under Naval command.\n\nOn 27 November 1919 the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]] was signed. In accordance with the [[treaty]] the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] was banned from operating [[military aircraft]] under any form for the next 20 years. All Bulgarian airplanes, balloons, aviation equipment, weaponry and ammunition were to be destroyed under Allied control and all personnel demobilised.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Bulgarian Treaty|journal=Flight|volume=11|number=39|date=September 1919|page=1284|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201282.html|accessdate=16 May 2019}}</ref> Under the terms of the treaty any aircraft procured for civilian purposes had to be bought from the countries on the winning side. The combined engine power for any airplane (including multi-engined ones) was not to exceed 180&nbsp;hp. In addition, the Bulgarian airspace was to be controlled by the allies and used according to the victorious countries' interests.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn accordance with the treaty during 1920 no less than 70 [[airplanes]], 110 [[aircraft engines]], 3 air balloons, 76 [[machine guns]], a number of photographic [[camera]]s and other aviation equipment were destroyed at the [[military airfield]] of Bozhurishte. The [[seaplanes]] of the [[Bulgarian Navy]] were delivered by train to the same airfield and scrapped soon after that.\n\n[[File:Dar10.jpg|thumb|right|A Bulgarian-manufactured [[DAR-10]] training plane. DAR produced small numbers of locally designed aircraft]]\n\nDue to the devotion of the Air Troops personnel and the help of the population of the surrounding villages, several aircraft were hidden, thus evading Allied inspection following destruction. Seven DFW C.V, Albatros C.III and a single Fokker D.VII were among the survivors. In addition, at least ten aviation engines ([[Benz Bz.IV]] and [[Mercedes D.III]]) were also saved.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Bulgarian government tried to get around the ban for military flight activity by establishing a Gendarmery Aeroplane Section in 1919. Since the Gendarmery was at that time a service under the Ministry of War, the creation of the unit was met by fierce opposition by the Allied commission. This almost resulted in the destruction of the whole [[Sofia Airport|Vrazhdebna Airfield]], but the disbandment of the unit prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAn Aeroflight Section under the Ministry of [[Railway]]s, [[Postal Service]] and [[Telegraph]] was created in 1920. Bulgarian aviation personnel assembled two airplanes from hidden spares and parts, salvaged from the destroyed military airplanes. The two aircraft, known as \"the mixed planes\", recorded about 1000 flight hours altogether. The sole remaining Bulgarian Fokker D.VII was disguised as a two-seater, thus being classified as a trainer and returning to active service.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn 5 July 1923 Bulgaria ratified the International Civil Aviation Treaty. From that moment on its air vehicles would carry a registration in the form B-B??? (the latter three signs being a combination of capital letters). In 1923 the first group of cadets, called \"student-flyers\" entered the Flying school at Vrazhdebna AF.\n\nThe following year (1924) the first new airplanes were acquired. Those were machines of the [[Potez VIII]], [[Caudron C.59]], Henriot XD.14 and Bristol 29 Tourer types; [[Avro 522]] seaplanes were also procured. During the same year the Bulgarian airplane construction specialist Atanas Grigorov (who obtained his qualification at the \"Albatroswerke \u2013 Berlin\") assembled his seaplane, called \"Grigorov-1\". The aircraft made several test-flights, recording excellent characteristics, but was damaged beyond repair by a storm in the hangar where it was stationed. Also in 1924 the Aeroplane Section was expanded to an Aeroflight Directorate still under the Ministry of Railways, Postal Service and Telegraph.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n1925 saw the [[Potez XVII]], [[Bristol Primary Trainer|Bristol Lucifer]] and [[Alenia Aermacchi|Macchi]] 2000/18 flying boat boosting the country's aircraft inventory. The Bulgarian government invited a group of German aircraft engineers, headed by the constructor Herr Hermann Winter to help establish an aviation factory. Named The State's Aeroconstruction Atelli\u00e9r or [[Darzhavna Aeroplanna Rabotilnitsa]] (DAR) the factory was initially managed by the first Bulgarian pilot to achieve an aerial victory \u2013 Mr. Marko Parvanov. The first aircraft types produced at the plant were the U-1 or \"Uzounov-1\" (an indigenous variant of the wartime German DFW C.V) and the [[DAR 2]] (an indigenous variant of the German [[Albatros C.III]] of the same era). Both types became well-known and loved by the personnel of the former Air Troops and gained Bulgarian combat service experience.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Development of a new type \u2013 the [[DAR 1]] \u2013 was also started.\n\n[[File:Stele-Plovdiv.jpg|thumb|right|One of the eagles that decorated the entrance of [[Bozhurishte Air Base]] in the 1930s and 1940s, now preserved at the [[Plovdiv Museum of Aviation]]]]\n\nDuring the course of 1926 the Airplane School was moved to the geographical center of the country. The town of [[Kazanlak]] was well suited, for it was far away from the Allied Control Commission. The [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] company [[Aero Vodochody]] also built an aircraft factory near that city, but its models were not up to the requirements of the Bulgarian authorities. After an unsuccessful switch to automotive production, the plant was finally sold to the Italian [[Caproni]] company. The factory became popular as \"Balgarski Kaproni\" or \"Bulgarian Caproni\". The first examples of the DAR 1 biplane were produced and entered service with the Aeroflight Directorate during 1926.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe 1927 structure of the Directorate was the following:\n* A fighter yato,<ref group=\"NOTE\">The Bulgarian word \"yato\" means a \"flock of birds\" and was the Bulgarian equivalent of an air force squadron at the time</ref> flying the DAR 1\n* A bomber yato, flying the DAR U-1 and DAR 2\n* A recon yato, flying the Potez XVII\n* A seaplane yato, flying Avro 522 floatplanes and Macchi 2000/18 flying boats\n* An aeroplane school, flying the [[Caudron C.59]], the [[Hanriot HD.14]] and the \u0160molnik \u0160.18\n\nIn 1928 the Ministry of War started the ambitious 10-year program for development of the military aviation (still banned by the peace treaty). According to the plan the following structure had to be achieved:\n* 4 army fighter orlyaks,<ref group=\"NOTE\">The Bulgarian word \"orlyak\" used here means a \"Air Group\"</ref> each made of two yatos, or overall 8 yatos flying 96 fighter planes\n* 4 army recon orlyaks, each made of two yatos, or overall 8 yatos flying 96 recon planes\n* 18 divisionary recon yatos, basically air support aviation, each flying 12 planes or 216 planes altogether\n* Strike Aviation Brigade with:\n** Fighter Orlyak of 48 machines\n** Bomber Orlyak of 36 machines\n** Recon Orlyak of 2 machines\n* Maritime Orlyak\n** 2 seaplane fighter yatos, flying 24 fighters\n** 2 seaplane bomber yatos, flying 18 bombers\n\nIn 1931 Bulgaria signed the Warsaw Treaty, concerning international civil air activities and the country was assigned the new civil registration \u2013 LZ-??? (the latter three signs being a combination of capital letters). In 1933 the Bulgarian Council of Ministers approved the following wartime order of battle of the aviation:\n* a mixed orlyak of:\n** a fighter yato\n** a bomber yato\n** a recon yato\n** a liaison and photographic survey yato\n* a maritime yato\n* a training orlyak\n* a Pilot School at Kazanlak airfield\n* a balloon company (which was never actually created, as the balloon was considered obsolete for military purposes at the time).\nBulgaria started acquiring German, Czechoslovak and Polish airplanes.\n\nIn 1934 the Aviation Regiment was renamed His Majesty's Air Troops, comprising a headquarters, with two army orlyaks (based at [[Bozhurishte]] and [[Plovdiv]] airfields), a training orlyak (in [[Plovdiv]]), a maritime yato (at NAS Chaika, Varna) and additional operational support units.

Each orlyak had a fighter, a line bomber and two reconnaissance yatos (Squadrons). There was also an Independent Aviation corps, which combined the 5th Bomber and 6th Fighter Regiments. The training units consisted of the \"Junker\" School Orlyak at [[Vrazhdebna]] airfield, the 2nd Training Orlyak at Telish airfield (called the Blind Flying Training School) and the 3rd Training Orlyak at [[Stara Zagora]] airfield. In 1940, the Bulgarian aviation industry provided the air force with 42 [[DAR 9 Siniger]] and 45 [[Caproni Ca.113|Kaproni-Bulgarski KB-5 Chuchuliga]] aircraft, along with preparing for serial production of the [[Caproni Ca.309|KB-6]] \u2013 Bulgaria's first twin-engined aircraft.

In April 1945, KdF-Stadt and its heavily bombed factory were captured by the Americans and subsequently handed over to the British, within whose [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zone]] the town and factory fell. The factories were placed under the control of [[Saddleworth]]-born Hirst, by then a civilian Military Governor with the occupying forces. At first, one plan was to use it for [[List of military vehicles|military vehicle]] maintenance, and possibly dismantle and ship it to Britain. Since it had been used for military production, (though not of KdF-Wagens) and had been in Hirst's words, a \"political animal\" rather than a commercial enterprise{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} \u2013 technically making it liable for destruction under the terms of the [[Potsdam Agreement]] \u2013 the equipment could have been salvaged as [[war reparations]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid-1947, though heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nOne of the factory's wartime 'KdF-Wagen' cars had been taken to the factory for repairs and abandoned there. Hirst had it repainted green and demonstrated it to British Army headquarters. Short of light transport, in September 1945 the British Army was persuaded to place a vital order for 20,000 cars. However, production facilities had been massively disrupted, there was a refugee crisis at and around the factory, and some parts (such as [[carburetor|carburettors]]) were unavailable. With striking humanity and great engineering and management ingenuity, Hirst and his German assistant [[Heinrich Nordhoff]] (who went on to run the Wolfsburg facility after the military government ended in 1949) helped to stabilize the acute social situation while simultaneously re-establishing production. Hirst, for example, used his fine engineering experience to arrange the manufacture of carburettors, the original producers being effectively 'lost' in the [[East Germany|Russian zone]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Porter|first1=Lindsay|title=Mr|journal=Thoroughbred & Classic Cars|date=October 1986}}</ref> The first few hundred cars went to personnel from the occupying forces, and to the [[Bundespost|German Post Office]].

The defeated German staff, he said, were initially sullen and unresponsive, having been conditioned by many years of Nazism and they were sometimes unresponsive to orders. At Nordhoff's suggestion, he sent back to England for his officer's uniform and from then on, had no difficulty in having his instructions followed. Hirst can be seen photographed at Wolfsburg in his uniform, although he was not actually a soldier at the time but a civilian member of the military government. The title of 'Major' was sometimes used by someone who had left the Army as a courtesy, but Hirst chose not to use the title.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe post-war [[industrial plans for Germany]] set out rules that governed which industries Germany was allowed to retain. These rules set German car production at a maximum of 10% of 1936 car production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&documentid=22&documentdate=1947-03-24&studycollectionid=mp&nav=OK |title=Harry S.

It was still unclear what was to become of the factory. It was offered to representatives from the American, Australian, British, and French motor industries. Famously, all rejected it. After an inspection of the plant, [[William Edward Rootes, 1st Baron Rootes|Sir William Rootes]], head of the British [[Rootes Group]], told Hirst the project would fail within two years, and that the car \"...is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and too noisy ...

In March 1948, the British offered the Volkswagen company to Ford, free of charge. [[Henry Ford II]], the son of [[Edsel Ford]], traveled to [[West Germany]] for discussions. Heinz Nordhoff was also present, as well as Ernest Breech, chairman of the board for Ford.

Apart from the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Type 2]] [[commercial vehicle]] (van, pick-up, and camper), and the [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|VW Karmann Ghia]] sports car, Nordhoff pursued the one-model policy until shortly before his death in 1968.\n\nVolkswagens were first exhibited and sold in the United States in 1949 but sold only two units in America that first year. On entry to the U.S. market, the VW was briefly sold as a ''Victory Wagon''. [[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]] was formed in April 1955 to standardize sales and service in the United States.

By 1966, the Type 1 came with a 1300 engine. By 1967 the Type 1 had a 1500 engine, and 1600 in 1970. The air-cooled engine lost favor in the United States market with the advent of non-leaded gasoline and smog controls. These air-cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel-rich in order to control engine over-heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW Production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on the USA West Coast where the limited-capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularized on the USA West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.\n\nVW expanded its product line in 1961 with the introduction of four [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3]] models (Karmann Ghia, Notchback, Fastback, and Variant) based on the new Type 3 mechanical underpinnings. The name 'Squareback' was used in the United States for the Variant.\n\nIn 1969 the larger [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4]] (411 and 412) models were introduced. These differed substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of [[monocoque]]/unibody construction, the option of a fully [[automatic transmission]], electronic [[fuel injection]], and a sturdier powerplant.\n\nIn 1964, Volkswagen acquired [[Auto Union]], and in 1969, [[NSU Motorenwerke AG]] (NSU). The former company owned the historic [[Audi]] brand, which had disappeared after the Second World War. VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its [[luxury vehicle]] [[marque]]. The purchase of Auto Union and NSU was a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air-cooled models went into decline.\n\nVolkswagen added a \"Super Beetle\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Dean |first=Wayne |date=28 October 2006 |url=http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |title=History of the Super Beetle |publisher=superbeetles.com |accessdate=6 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506213643/http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |archive-date=6 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 differed from the standard Beetle in its use of a [[MacPherson strut]] front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] instead of the usual [[torsion beam suspension|torsion bars]]. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in the model year 1975 and up. The front of the car was stretched {{convert|2|in|mm}} to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.\n\nIn 1973, Volkswagen introduced the military-themed [[Volkswagen 181|Type 181]], or \"Trekker\" in Europe, \"Thing\" in America, recalling the wartime Type 82. The military version was produced for the [[NATO]]-era [[German Army]] during the [[Cold War]] years of 1970 to 1979. The U.S. Thing version only sold for two years, 1973 and 1974.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038791-0007, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Volkswagen Type 4]] [[assembly line]] in [[Wolfsburg]] as of 1973]]\n[[File:1969 Volkswagen 1600 Type 3 Squareback (17081445566).jpg|thumb|right|1969 VW Squareback (Type III)]]\n\nBy late 1972, Volkswagen had decided to cancel the nearly finished [[:File:Volkswagen EA266 prototype Beetle replacement.JPG|typ 266]], a project for a mid-engined car to replace the Beetle, and to focus on front-wheel-drive, water-cooled cars.

Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets. The company knew that Beetle production had to end, but faced a conundrum of how to replace it. VW's ownership of Audi/[[Auto Union]] proved beneficial. Its expertise in [[front-wheel drive]], and [[water cooling|water-cooled]] engines would help Volkswagen produce a credible Beetle successor. Audi influences paved the way for this new generation of Volkswagens: the Passat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo.\n\nFirst in the series was the [[Volkswagen Passat]] (Dasher in the US), introduced in 1973, a [[fastback]] version of the [[Audi 80]], using many identical body and mechanical parts. Estate/wagon versions were available in many markets. In Europe, the estate/wagon version dominated market share for many years.\n\nIn spring 1974, the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] followed. The coupe was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Based on the platform of the not yet released [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], it was built at [[Karmann]] due to capacity constraints at Volkswagen.\n\nThe pivotal model emerged as the Volkswagen Golf in 1974, marketed in the United States and Canada as the Rabbit for the 1st generation (1975\u20131985) and 5th generation (2006\u20132009). Its angular styling was designed by the Italian [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Its design followed trends for small family cars set by the 1959 [[Mini]]&nbsp;\u2013 the Golf had a [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]], water-cooled engine in the front, driving the front wheels, and had a [[hatchback]], a format that has dominated the market segment ever since. Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon the Golf's introduction. It continued in smaller numbers at other German factories ([[Hanover]] and [[Emden]]) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIn 1975, the [[Volkswagen Polo]] followed. It was a re-badged [[Audi 50]], which was soon discontinued in 1978. The Polo became the base of the [[Volkswagen Derby]], which was introduced in 1977. The Derby was for all intents and purposes a [[Three-box styling|three-box design]] of the Polo. After a second model generation, the Derby was discontinued in 1985, although the body style lived on in the form of the polo classic/polo saloon until 1991.\n\nPassat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo shared many character-defining features, as well as parts and engines. They built the basis for Volkswagen's turn-around.\n\n===1974\u20131990: Product line expansion===\n[[File:VW Polo I front 20090810.jpg|thumb|[[Volkswagen Polo Mk1|Volkswagen Polo]] (1975\u20131979 model)]]\n\nWhile Volkswagen's range of cars soon became similar to that of other large European automakers, the Golf has been the mainstay of the Volkswagen lineup since its introduction,{{when|date=July 2017}} and the mechanical basis for several other cars of the company. There have been eight generations of the [[Volkswagen Golf]], the first of which was produced from the summer of 1974 until the autumn of 1983 (sold as the Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Caribe in Latin America). Its chassis also spawned the [[Volkswagen Scirocco]] sport [[coupe]], [[Volkswagen Jetta]] saloon/sedan, Volkswagen Golf [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] convertible, and [[Volkswagen Caddy]] pick-up. North American production of the Rabbit commenced at the [[Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant]] near [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] in 1978. It would be produced in the United States as the Rabbit until the spring of 1984. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}The second-generation Golf hatchback/Jetta sedan ran from October 1983 until the autumn of 1991, and a North American version produced at Westmoreland Assembly went on sale at the start of the 1985 model year. The production numbers of the first-generation Golf has continued to grow annually in South Africa as the [[Volkswagen Citi Golf|Citi Golf]], with only minor modifications to the interior, engine and chassis, using tooling relocated from the [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] plant when that site began to build the Second Generation car.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 1980s, Volkswagen's sales in the United States and Canada fell dramatically, despite the success of models like the Golf elsewhere. Sales in the United States were 293,595 in 1980, but by 1984 they were down to 177,709.<ref>Flammang, James, ''Volkswagen: Beetles, Buses and Beyond,'' Krause Publications, 1996</ref>  The introduction of the second-generation Golf, GTI and Jetta models helped Volkswagen briefly in North America.

It was a strong seller in West Germany and most of the rest of Western Europe, being one of the first foreign small cars to prove popular in Britain. It had started out in 1974 as the [[Audi 50]], which was only available in certain markets and was less popular.

The momentum continued for fiscal 2006, as Volkswagen's North American sales for the year were 235,140 vehicles, a 4.9 percent increase over 2005, despite a slump in domestic North American manufacturer's sales. In conjunction with the introduction of new models, the production location of Volkswagen vehicles also underwent a great change. The 2007 [[Volkswagen Eos|Eos]], a hardtop convertible, is produced in a new facility in Portugal. All Golfs/Rabbits and GTIs as of 2006 are manufactured in Wolfsburg, Germany, rather than Puebla, Mexico, where Golfs and GTIs for the North American market were produced from 1989 to 1998, and the Brazilian factory in [[Curitiba]], where Golfs and GTIs were produced from 1999 to 2006 (the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]] has been primarily manufactured in Mexico since 1989). Volkswagen is also in the process of reconfiguring an automotive assembly plant in Belgium. The new models and investments in manufacturing improvements were immediately noticed by automotive critics. Favorable reviews for Volkswagen's newest cars include the GTI being named by ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' as the top sporty car under $25,000, one of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's \"[[Car and Driver Ten Best|10 Best]]\" for 2007, [[Automobile Magazine|''Automobile'' Magazine's]] 2007 Car of the Year, as well as a 2008 ''[[Motor Trend]]'' comparison ranking the mid-size Passat first in its class.\n\n[[File:2013 Volkswagen Golf SE BlueMotion Technology 1.4 Front.jpg|thumb|left|The seventh-generation [[Volkswagen Golf]]]]\n\nVolkswagen partnered with [[Daimler AG]] and other companies to market the [[BlueTec]] [[clean diesel]] technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and other companies and brands.

They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% [[biodiesel]] fuel.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For the 2007 model year, however, strict U.S. government emissions regulations have forced Volkswagen to drop most diesels from their U.S. engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines (then thought) compatible to U.S. standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]], made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the [[Porsche Cayenne]] and later the [[Audi Q7]]. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass. Volkswagen set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from the \"Concept A\" concept vehicle introduced at the 2006 [[Geneva Auto Show]], and on 20 July 2006, Volkswagen announced that the new vehicle called the [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]].\n\nSince the discontinuance of the T4 in 2003 and the decision not to export the T5 to the United States, Volkswagen, coincidentally, lacked a van for its North American lineup. To remedy this, Volkswagen launched the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]] made for the American and Canadian markets, in 2008.\n\nIn September 2006, Volkswagen began offering the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4#Mk4 \"City Golf (Golf City in 2009)\" in Canada, South America & Bora HS in China|City Golf]] and City Jetta only for the Canadian market. Both models were originally the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Mk4 Golf]] and Jetta but were later replaced with the Brazilian versions of the Golf Mk4 and [[Volkswagen Bora|Bora]]. Volkswagen's introduction of such models is seen as a test of the market for a subcompact and, if successful, may be the beginnings of a thriving subcompact market for Volkswagen.\n\n[[File:2006-2010 Volkswagen Passat (3C) sedan (2011-07-17) 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Passat]] (3C)]]\n\nIn May 2011, Volkswagen completed [[Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant|Chattanooga Assembly]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]].

The car designs were put through rigorous tests and achieved a record-breaking million miles of testing before being deemed finished.\n\nThe construction of the new factory started in May 1938 in the new town of \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens\" (modern-day [[Wolfsburg]]), which had been purpose-built for the factory workers.<ref name=\"Odin, L.C. 2015\"/> This factory had only produced a handful of cars by the time war started in 1939.

In April 1945, KdF-Stadt and its heavily bombed factory were captured by the Americans and subsequently handed over to the British, within whose [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zone]] the town and factory fell. The factories were placed under the control of [[Saddleworth]]-born Hirst, by then a civilian Military Governor with the occupying forces. At first, one plan was to use it for [[List of military vehicles|military vehicle]] maintenance, and possibly dismantle and ship it to Britain. Since it had been used for military production, (though not of KdF-Wagens) and had been in Hirst's words, a \"political animal\" rather than a commercial enterprise{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} \u2013 technically making it liable for destruction under the terms of the [[Potsdam Agreement]] \u2013 the equipment could have been salvaged as [[war reparations]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid-1947, though heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nOne of the factory's wartime 'KdF-Wagen' cars had been taken to the factory for repairs and abandoned there. Hirst had it repainted green and demonstrated it to British Army headquarters. Short of light transport, in September 1945 the British Army was persuaded to place a vital order for 20,000 cars. However, production facilities had been massively disrupted, there was a refugee crisis at and around the factory, and some parts (such as [[carburetor|carburettors]]) were unavailable. With striking humanity and great engineering and management ingenuity, Hirst and his German assistant [[Heinrich Nordhoff]] (who went on to run the Wolfsburg facility after the military government ended in 1949) helped to stabilize the acute social situation while simultaneously re-establishing production. Hirst, for example, used his fine engineering experience to arrange the manufacture of carburettors, the original producers being effectively 'lost' in the [[East Germany|Russian zone]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Porter|first1=Lindsay|title=Mr|journal=Thoroughbred & Classic Cars|date=October 1986}}</ref> The first few hundred cars went to personnel from the occupying forces, and to the [[Bundespost|German Post Office]].

The defeated German staff, he said, were initially sullen and unresponsive, having been conditioned by many years of Nazism and they were sometimes unresponsive to orders. At Nordhoff's suggestion, he sent back to England for his officer's uniform and from then on, had no difficulty in having his instructions followed. Hirst can be seen photographed at Wolfsburg in his uniform, although he was not actually a soldier at the time but a civilian member of the military government. The title of 'Major' was sometimes used by someone who had left the Army as a courtesy, but Hirst chose not to use the title.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe post-war [[industrial plans for Germany]] set out rules that governed which industries Germany was allowed to retain. These rules set German car production at a maximum of 10% of 1936 car production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&documentid=22&documentdate=1947-03-24&studycollectionid=mp&nav=OK |title=Harry S.

It was still unclear what was to become of the factory. It was offered to representatives from the American, Australian, British, and French motor industries. Famously, all rejected it. After an inspection of the plant, [[William Edward Rootes, 1st Baron Rootes|Sir William Rootes]], head of the British [[Rootes Group]], told Hirst the project would fail within two years, and that the car \"...is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and too noisy ...

Apart from the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Type 2]] [[commercial vehicle]] (van, pick-up, and camper), and the [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|VW Karmann Ghia]] sports car, Nordhoff pursued the one-model policy until shortly before his death in 1968.\n\nVolkswagens were first exhibited and sold in the United States in 1949 but sold only two units in America that first year. On entry to the U.S. market, the VW was briefly sold as a ''Victory Wagon''. [[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]] was formed in April 1955 to standardize sales and service in the United States. Production of the Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle increased dramatically over the years, the total reaching one million in 1955.\n\nThe UK's first official Volkswagen Importer, Colborne Garages of [[Ripley, Surrey]], started with parts for the models brought home by soldiers returning from Germany.<ref name=uk-import-first/>\n\nCanadian Motors, Limited brought in Canada's first shipment of Volkswagens on 10 July 1952 (shipping order 143075){{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

By 1966, the Type 1 came with a 1300 engine. By 1967 the Type 1 had a 1500 engine, and 1600 in 1970. The air-cooled engine lost favor in the United States market with the advent of non-leaded gasoline and smog controls. These air-cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel-rich in order to control engine over-heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW Production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on the USA West Coast where the limited-capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularized on the USA West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.\n\nVW expanded its product line in 1961 with the introduction of four [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3]] models (Karmann Ghia, Notchback, Fastback, and Variant) based on the new Type 3 mechanical underpinnings. The name 'Squareback' was used in the United States for the Variant.\n\nIn 1969 the larger [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4]] (411 and 412) models were introduced. These differed substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of [[monocoque]]/unibody construction, the option of a fully [[automatic transmission]], electronic [[fuel injection]], and a sturdier powerplant.\n\nIn 1964, Volkswagen acquired [[Auto Union]], and in 1969, [[NSU Motorenwerke AG]] (NSU). The former company owned the historic [[Audi]] brand, which had disappeared after the Second World War. VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its [[luxury vehicle]] [[marque]]. The purchase of Auto Union and NSU was a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air-cooled models went into decline.\n\nVolkswagen added a \"Super Beetle\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Dean |first=Wayne |date=28 October 2006 |url=http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |title=History of the Super Beetle |publisher=superbeetles.com |accessdate=6 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506213643/http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |archive-date=6 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 differed from the standard Beetle in its use of a [[MacPherson strut]] front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] instead of the usual [[torsion beam suspension|torsion bars]]. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in the model year 1975 and up. The front of the car was stretched {{convert|2|in|mm}} to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.\n\nIn 1973, Volkswagen introduced the military-themed [[Volkswagen 181|Type 181]], or \"Trekker\" in Europe, \"Thing\" in America, recalling the wartime Type 82. The military version was produced for the [[NATO]]-era [[German Army]] during the [[Cold War]] years of 1970 to 1979. The U.S. Thing version only sold for two years, 1973 and 1974.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038791-0007, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Volkswagen Type 4]] [[assembly line]] in [[Wolfsburg]] as of 1973]]\n[[File:1969 Volkswagen 1600 Type 3 Squareback (17081445566).jpg|thumb|right|1969 VW Squareback (Type III)]]\n\nBy late 1972, Volkswagen had decided to cancel the nearly finished [[:File:Volkswagen EA266 prototype Beetle replacement.JPG|typ 266]], a project for a mid-engined car to replace the Beetle, and to focus on front-wheel-drive, water-cooled cars.

Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets. The company knew that Beetle production had to end, but faced a conundrum of how to replace it. VW's ownership of Audi/[[Auto Union]] proved beneficial. Its expertise in [[front-wheel drive]], and [[water cooling|water-cooled]] engines would help Volkswagen produce a credible Beetle successor. Audi influences paved the way for this new generation of Volkswagens: the Passat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo.\n\nFirst in the series was the [[Volkswagen Passat]] (Dasher in the US), introduced in 1973, a [[fastback]] version of the [[Audi 80]], using many identical body and mechanical parts. Estate/wagon versions were available in many markets. In Europe, the estate/wagon version dominated market share for many years.\n\nIn spring 1974, the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] followed. The coupe was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Based on the platform of the not yet released [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], it was built at [[Karmann]] due to capacity constraints at Volkswagen.\n\nThe pivotal model emerged as the Volkswagen Golf in 1974, marketed in the United States and Canada as the Rabbit for the 1st generation (1975\u20131985) and 5th generation (2006\u20132009). Its angular styling was designed by the Italian [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Its design followed trends for small family cars set by the 1959 [[Mini]]&nbsp;\u2013 the Golf had a [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]], water-cooled engine in the front, driving the front wheels, and had a [[hatchback]], a format that has dominated the market segment ever since. Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon the Golf's introduction. It continued in smaller numbers at other German factories ([[Hanover]] and [[Emden]]) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIn 1975, the [[Volkswagen Polo]] followed. It was a re-badged [[Audi 50]], which was soon discontinued in 1978. The Polo became the base of the [[Volkswagen Derby]], which was introduced in 1977. The Derby was for all intents and purposes a [[Three-box styling|three-box design]] of the Polo. After a second model generation, the Derby was discontinued in 1985, although the body style lived on in the form of the polo classic/polo saloon until 1991.\n\nPassat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo shared many character-defining features, as well as parts and engines. They built the basis for Volkswagen's turn-around.\n\n===1974\u20131990: Product line expansion===\n[[File:VW Polo I front 20090810.jpg|thumb|[[Volkswagen Polo Mk1|Volkswagen Polo]] (1975\u20131979 model)]]\n\nWhile Volkswagen's range of cars soon became similar to that of other large European automakers, the Golf has been the mainstay of the Volkswagen lineup since its introduction,{{when|date=July 2017}} and the mechanical basis for several other cars of the company. There have been eight generations of the [[Volkswagen Golf]], the first of which was produced from the summer of 1974 until the autumn of 1983 (sold as the Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Caribe in Latin America). Its chassis also spawned the [[Volkswagen Scirocco]] sport [[coupe]], [[Volkswagen Jetta]] saloon/sedan, Volkswagen Golf [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] convertible, and [[Volkswagen Caddy]] pick-up. North American production of the Rabbit commenced at the [[Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant]] near [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] in 1978. It would be produced in the United States as the Rabbit until the spring of 1984. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}The second-generation Golf hatchback/Jetta sedan ran from October 1983 until the autumn of 1991, and a North American version produced at Westmoreland Assembly went on sale at the start of the 1985 model year. The production numbers of the first-generation Golf has continued to grow annually in South Africa as the [[Volkswagen Citi Golf|Citi Golf]], with only minor modifications to the interior, engine and chassis, using tooling relocated from the [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] plant when that site began to build the Second Generation car.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 1980s, Volkswagen's sales in the United States and Canada fell dramatically, despite the success of models like the Golf elsewhere. Sales in the United States were 293,595 in 1980, but by 1984 they were down to 177,709.<ref>Flammang, James, ''Volkswagen: Beetles, Buses and Beyond,'' Krause Publications, 1996</ref>  The introduction of the second-generation Golf, GTI and Jetta models helped Volkswagen briefly in North America.

Other main models during the decade include the [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]], a smaller car than the Golf, and the larger [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] for the segment above the Golf.\n\nIn 1998 the company launched the new [[Volkswagen Lupo|Lupo]] city car.

The sixth-generation [[Volkswagen Golf Mk6|VW Golf]] was launched in 2008, came runner-up to the [[Opel Insignia|Opel/Vauxhall Insignia]] in the 2009 [[European Car of the Year]], and has spawned several cousins: [[Volkswagen Jetta (A6)|VW Jetta]], [[VW Scirocco]], SEAT Le\u00f3n, SEAT Toledo, [[\u0160koda Octavia]] and Audi A3 hatchback ranges, as well as a new mini-[[Multi-purpose vehicle|MPV]], the [[SEAT Altea]]. The GTI, a \"[[hot hatch]]\" performance version of the Golf, boasts a 2.0&nbsp;L [[Turbocharger|Turbocharged]] Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) [[Gasoline direct injection|direct injection]] engine. VW began marketing the Golf under the Rabbit name once again in the U.S. and Canada in 2006.\n\nThe sixth-generation Passat and the fifth-generation Jetta both debuted in 2005, and Volkswagen announced plans to expand its lineup further by bringing back the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] by 2008. Other models in [[Wolfgang Bernhard]]'s (Volkswagen brand CEO) \"product offensive\" include the [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]] mid-sized SUV in 2008 and a [[Volkswagen Passat Coup\u00e9|Passat Coup\u00e9]]. In November 2006 Bernd Pischetsrieder announced his resignation as Volkswagen Group CEO and was replaced by Audi worldwide CEO [[Martin Winterkorn]] at the beginning of 2007.\n\n[[File:VW Scirocco III 1.4 TSI DSG Team Deep Black.JPG|thumb|right|The third generation [[Volkswagen Scirocco]]]]\n\nVolkswagen in 2005 maintained North American sales of 224,195. The momentum continued for fiscal 2006, as Volkswagen's North American sales for the year were 235,140 vehicles, a 4.9 percent increase over 2005, despite a slump in domestic North American manufacturer's sales. In conjunction with the introduction of new models, the production location of Volkswagen vehicles also underwent a great change. The 2007 [[Volkswagen Eos|Eos]], a hardtop convertible, is produced in a new facility in Portugal. All Golfs/Rabbits and GTIs as of 2006 are manufactured in Wolfsburg, Germany, rather than Puebla, Mexico, where Golfs and GTIs for the North American market were produced from 1989 to 1998, and the Brazilian factory in [[Curitiba]], where Golfs and GTIs were produced from 1999 to 2006 (the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]] has been primarily manufactured in Mexico since 1989). Volkswagen is also in the process of reconfiguring an automotive assembly plant in Belgium. The new models and investments in manufacturing improvements were immediately noticed by automotive critics. Favorable reviews for Volkswagen's newest cars include the GTI being named by ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' as the top sporty car under $25,000, one of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's \"[[Car and Driver Ten Best|10 Best]]\" for 2007, [[Automobile Magazine|''Automobile'' Magazine's]] 2007 Car of the Year, as well as a 2008 ''[[Motor Trend]]'' comparison ranking the mid-size Passat first in its class.\n\n[[File:2013 Volkswagen Golf SE BlueMotion Technology 1.4 Front.jpg|thumb|left|The seventh-generation [[Volkswagen Golf]]]]\n\nVolkswagen partnered with [[Daimler AG]] and other companies to market the [[BlueTec]] [[clean diesel]] technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and other companies and brands.

They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% [[biodiesel]] fuel.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For the 2007 model year, however, strict U.S. government emissions regulations have forced Volkswagen to drop most diesels from their U.S. engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines (then thought) compatible to U.S. standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]], made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the [[Porsche Cayenne]] and later the [[Audi Q7]]. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass. Volkswagen set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from the \"Concept A\" concept vehicle introduced at the 2006 [[Geneva Auto Show]], and on 20 July 2006, Volkswagen announced that the new vehicle called the [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]].\n\nSince the discontinuance of the T4 in 2003 and the decision not to export the T5 to the United States, Volkswagen, coincidentally, lacked a van for its North American lineup. To remedy this, Volkswagen launched the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]] made for the American and Canadian markets, in 2008.\n\nIn September 2006, Volkswagen began offering the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4#Mk4 \"City Golf (Golf City in 2009)\" in Canada, South America & Bora HS in China|City Golf]] and City Jetta only for the Canadian market. Both models were originally the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Mk4 Golf]] and Jetta but were later replaced with the Brazilian versions of the Golf Mk4 and [[Volkswagen Bora|Bora]]. Volkswagen's introduction of such models is seen as a test of the market for a subcompact and, if successful, may be the beginnings of a thriving subcompact market for Volkswagen.\n\n[[File:2006-2010 Volkswagen Passat (3C) sedan (2011-07-17) 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Passat]] (3C)]]\n\nIn May 2011, Volkswagen completed [[Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant|Chattanooga Assembly]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]].

The first Porsche car, the [[Porsche 64]] of 1938, used many components from the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. The 1948 [[Porsche 356]] continued using many Volkswagen components, including a tuned engine, [[gearbox]] and suspension.\n\nThe two companies continued their collaboration in 1969 to make the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914 and Porsche 914-6]]. (The 914-6 had a 6-cylinder Porsche engine, and the standard 914 had a Volkswagen engine.) Volkswagen and Porsche would collaborate again in 1976 on the [[Porsche 912]]-E (the USA only) and the [[Porsche 924]], which used many [[Audi]] components and was built at Audi's [[Neckarsulm]] facilities. The 924 was originally designated for AUDI. Most [[Porsche 944]] models were built there, although they used far fewer VW components.\n\nThe [[Porsche Cayenne]], introduced in 2002, shares its entire chassis with the [[Volkswagen Touareg]] and [[Audi Q7]], and is built at the same Volkswagen factory in [[Bratislava]] that the other SUV's are built.\n\nIn September 2005, Porsche announced it would increase its 5% stake in Volkswagen to 20% at a cost of \u20ac3&nbsp;billion, with the intention that the combined stakes of Porsche and the government of Lower Saxony would ensure that any hostile takeover by foreign investors would be impossible.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4281864.stm |title=Porsche wants 20% Volkswagen deal &#124; 26 September 2005 |work=BBC News |date=26 September 2005 |accessdate=27 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006040107/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4281864.stm |archive-date=6 October 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Speculated suitors included [[DaimlerChrysler]], [[BMW]], and [[Renault]].
