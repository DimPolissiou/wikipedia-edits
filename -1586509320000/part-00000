Its divisions in [[Ecuador]] and [[Uruguay]]  trade under the brands T\u00eda, MAGDA, Ta-Ta and MULTI AHORRO, where they are together the largest [[discount retailer]], with over 450 locations. T\u00eda S.A. (Colombia) operated 19 locations under the T\u00eda brand, until it closed in 2017 because of poor sales.\n\n== History ==\nT\u00eda was formed by the [[Eastern European]] [[supermarket chain]] Te-Ta founded by Kerel Steuer and Federico Deutsch in the 1920s in [[Prague]]. They traded in Czechoslovakia, [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]], but in 1940, after the start of World War II, they emigrated to the Americas, leaving everything behind. They restarted that year in [[Bogot\u00e1]], Colombia as '''T\u00eda''', and later expanded into Argentina, Peru, Uruguay and Ecuador using T\u00eda and other brand names.\n\nSteuer and Deutsch had stores where customers could find everything, with no need to shop elsewhere. The first T\u00eda store in South America  on October 14, 1940, on [[Carrera S\u00e9ptima]] in Bogot\u00e1.\n\nThe South American store industry has been a support for the development of this business organization, which besides the supermarket segment, allowed small manufacturing operations to arise over time and become important manufacturing companies in Colombia, Argentina, Ecuador, and Uruguay. T\u00eda was one of the first stores to enter the market of private labels. This store was a pioneer in many aspects, which have served as a basis for national and international chains to modernize their business model.\n\nCurrently, T\u00eda is present in Ecuador and Uruguay. The Argentinean division with its 61 stores was sold to French supermarket chain [[Carrefour]] in 1999 for US$630 million and was rebranded first as Norte, then as Carrefour. The Peruvian division was sold after failing in the Peruvian market.

His [[List of awards and nominations received by Ben Affleck|accolades]] include two [[Academy Awards]] and three [[Golden Globe Awards]]. He began his career as a child when he starred in the [[PBS]] educational series ''[[The Voyage of the Mimi]]'' (1984, 1988). He later appeared in the independent coming-of-age comedy ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'' (1993) and various [[Kevin Smith]] films, including ''[[Mallrats]]'' (1995), ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997) and ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' (1999). Affleck gained wider recognition when he and childhood friend [[Matt Damon]] won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Golden Globe]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for writing ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (1997), which they also starred in. He then established himself as a leading man in studio films, including the disaster film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' (1998), the romantic comedy ''[[Forces of Nature (1999 film)|Forces of Nature]]'' (1999), the war drama ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (2001), and the spy thriller ''[[The Sum of All Fears (film)|The Sum of All Fears]]'' (2002).\n\nAfter a career downturn, during which he appeared in ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'' and ''[[Gigli (film)|Gigli]]'' (both 2003), Affleck received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance in the noir biopic ''[[Hollywoodland]]'' (2006). His directorial debut, ''[[Gone Baby Gone]]'' (2007), which he also co-wrote, was well received. He then directed, co-wrote and starred in the crime drama ''[[The Town (2010 film)|The Town]]'' (2010) and directed and starred in the political thriller ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'' (2012). For the latter, Affleck won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|BAFTA Award]] for Best Director, and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|BAFTA]], and [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. He has since starred in the psychological thriller ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]'' (2014), played the superhero [[Batman]] in both ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) and ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), and starred in the action thrillers ''[[The Accountant (2016 film)|The Accountant]]'' (2016) and ''[[Triple Frontier (film)|Triple Frontier]]'' (2019). He received praise for his performance as a recovering alcoholic in the sports drama ''[[The Way Back (2020 film)|The Way Back]]'' (2020).\n\nAffleck is the co-founder of the [[Eastern Congo Initiative]], a [[Grant (money)|grantmaking]] and advocacy-based nonprofit organization. He is also a stalwart supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Affleck and Damon are co-owners of the production company [[Pearl Street Films]].\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin G\u00e9za Affleck-Boldt was born on August 15, 1972 in [[Berkeley, California]].<ref name=fullname>{{cite web|url=http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2015/02/shonda-rhimes-scandal-quotes|title=You Won't Believe Shonda Rhime's Method for Knowing Whether a Story Works|first=Jessica|last=Radloff|work=[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]|date=February 15, 2015|accessdate=March 27, 2015 | archivedate=May 2, 2015| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102530/http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2015/02/shonda-rhimes-scandal-quotes | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>He is listed as \"Benjamin G.

The area that is now modern-day Mexico has cradled many predecessor civilizations, going back as far as the [[Olmec]] which influenced the latter civilizations of [[Teotihuacan]] (200 B.C. to 700 A.D.) and the much debated [[Toltec]] people who flourished around the 10th and 12th centuries A.D., and ending with the last great indigenous civilization before the [[Spanish Conquest]], the [[Aztec]]s (13 March 1325 to 13 August 1521). The Nahuatl language was a common tongue in the region of modern Central Mexico during the Aztec Empire, but after the arrival of Europeans the common language of the region became Spanish.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec empire]], the Spanish re-administered the land and expanded their own empire beyond the former boundaries of the Aztec, adding more territory to the Mexican sphere of influence which remained under the Spanish Crown for 300 years. Cultural diffusion and intermixing among the Amerindian populations with the European created the modern Mexican identity which is a mixture of regional indigenous and European cultures that evolved into a national culture during the Spanish period. This new identity was defined as \"''Mexican''\" shortly after the [[Mexican War of Independence]] and was more invigorated and developed after the [[Mexican Revolution]] when the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1917]] officially established Mexico as an indivisible pluricultural nation founded on its indigenous roots.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Definitions==\n[[File:Adriana_Louvier.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Adriana Louvier]] Mexican television actress and presenter.]]\n<!-- In this section there should be a detailed elaboration of the Mexican identity as Mexicans themselves see it. \"Mexican\" is not merely a nationality in the eyes of Mexicans, it is their ethnic identity.

In the proceeding sections is where race and ethnicity is tackled in more detail such as the racial composition of the Mexican majority as well as the regional cultures of different Mexican states and indigenous groups.-->\n\n''Mexicano'' (Mexican) is derived from the word ''[[Mexico]]'' itself.

The system of interconnected lakes, of which Texcoco formed the center, had the form of a rabbit, which the Mesoamericans [[pareidolia|pareidolically]] associated with the [[moon rabbit|Moon]].

In that time the term did not apply to a nationality nor to the geographical limits of the modern Mexican Republic. The term was used for the first time in the first document printed in [[Barcelona]] in 1566 which documented the expedition which launched from the port in [[Acapulco]] to find the best route which would favor a return journey from the [[East Indies|Spanish East Indies]] to [[New Spain]].

Such as the [[Costa Chica of Oaxaca]] and the [[Costa Chica of Guerrero]], Veracruz (e.g. [[Yanga, Veracruz|Yanga]]) and in some towns in northern Mexico. The existence of blacks in Mexico is unknown, denied or diminished in both Mexico and abroad for a number of reasons: their small numbers, heavy intermarriage with other ethnic groups and Mexico's tradition of defining itself as a \"mestizaje\" or mixing of European and indigenous. Mexico did have an active slave trade since the early Spanish period but from the beginning, intermarriage and mixed race offspring created an elaborate caste system. This system broke down in the very late Spanish period and after Independence the legal notion of race was eliminated. The creation of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past actively or passively eliminating its African one from popular consciousness.\n\nThe majority of Mexico's native Afro-descendants are ''Afromestizos'', i.e. \"mixed-race\". Individuals with significantly high amounts of African ancestry make up a very low percentage of the total Mexican population, the majority being recent black immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean and elsewhere in the Americas. According to the Intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government, Afro-Mexicans make up 1.2% of Mexico's population, the Afro-Mexican category in the Intercensal survey includes people who self-identified solely as African and people who self-identified as partially African. The survey also states that 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous, with 9.3% being speakers of [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]].<ref name=\"Encuesta Intercensal 2015\"/>\n\n===Asian Mexicans===\n{{main|Asian Mexicans}}\n[[File:Comunidad japonesa de Monterrey.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese Mexican]] youths in [[Monterrey]]]]\nAsian Mexicans make up less than 1% of the total population of modern [[Mexico]], nonetheless they are a notable minority.

She arrived in [[New Spain]] and eventually she gave rise to the \"[[China Poblana]]\".\n\nThese early individuals are not very apparent in modern Mexico for two main reasons: the widespread ''[[mestizaje]]'' of Mexico during the Spanish period and the common practice of ''Chino'' slaves to \"[[Passing (racial identity)|pass]]\" as ''Indios'' (the indigenous people of Mexico) in order to attain freedom. As had occurred with a large portion of Mexico's black population, over generations the Asian populace was absorbed into the general [[Mestizo]] population. Facilitating this [[miscegenation]] was the assimilation of Asians into the indigenous population. The indigenous people were legally protected from [[chattel slavery]], and by being recognized as part of this group, Asian slaves could claim they were wrongly enslaved.\n\nAsians, predominantly Chinese, became Mexico's fastest-growing immigrant group from the 1880s to the 1920s, exploding from about 1,500 in 1895 to more than 20,000 in 1910.<ref name=\"Buchenau\">{{cite journal |last1= Buchenau |first1=J\u00fcrgen |date=Spring 2001 |title= Small Numbers, Great Impact: Mexico and Its Immigrants, 1821-1973 |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rgolden/MexicoImmigration.pdf |journal=Journal of American Ethnic History |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=35 |pmid=17605190 }}</ref>\n\n==Today==\n[[File:Luismiguel9900.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Luis Miguel]], always referred to as ''The Sun of Mexico''.]]\n\nEthnic relations in modern Mexico have grown out of the historical context of the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|arrival of Europeans]], the subsequent Spanish period of cultural and genetic miscegenation within the frame work of the [[castas]] system, the revolutionary periods focus on incorporating all ethnic and racial group into a common Mexican national identity and the indigenous revival of the late 20th century.

Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost, thus most of what is now known about it comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as Prussian geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Each author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country although they don't vary much, with Europeans ranging from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos ranging from 21% to 25%, Indians ranging from 51% to 61% and Africans being between 6,000 and 10,000, The estimations given for the total population range from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. It is concluded then, that across nearly three centuries of colonization, the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%-17% per century. The authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates, the reason for the indigenous population's numbers decreasing lies on them suffering of higher mortality rates, due living in remote locations rather than on cities and towns founded by the Spanish colonists or being at war with them. It is also for these reasons that the number of Indigenous Mexicans presents the greater variation range between publications, as in cases their numbers in a given location were estimated rather than counted, leading to possible overestimations in some provinces and possible underestimations in others.<ref>[http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf \"Consideraciones sobre la poblaci\u00f3n de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a (1793-1810)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731104825/http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf |date=31 July 2017 }}, ''El Colegio de Mexico'', Mexico, Retrieved on 24 July 2017.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:center; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Intendecy/territory\n!European population (%)\n!Indigenous population (%)\n!Mestizo population (%)\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[State of M\u00e9xico|M\u00e9xico]] (only the [[State of Mexico]] and [[Mexico City]])\n| 16.9%\n| 66.1%\n| 16.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Puebla]]\n| 10.1%\n| 74.3%\n| 15.3%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Oaxaca]]\n| 06.3%\n| 88.2%\n| 05.2%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Guanajuato]]\n| 25.8%\n| 44.0%\n| 29.9%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]\n| 13.0%\n| 51.2%\n| 35.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Zacatecas]]\n| 15.8%\n| 29.0%\n| 55.1%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Durango]]\n| 20.2%\n| 36.0%\n| 43.5%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Sonora]]\n| 28.5%\n| 44.9%\n| 26.4%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Yucat\u00e1n]]\n| 14.8%\n| 72.6%\n| 12.3%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Guadalajara]]\n| 31.7%\n| 33.3%\n| 34.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Veracruz]]\n| 10.4%\n| 74.0%\n| 15.2%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Michoacan|Valladolid]]\n| 27.6%\n| 42.5%\n| 29.6%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[New Mexico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]\n| ~\n| 30.8%\n| 69.0%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Baja California|Vieja California]]\n| ~\n| 51.7%\n| 47.9%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Alta California|Nueva California]]\n| ~\n| 89.9%\n| 09.8%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Coahuila]]\n| 30.9%\n| 28.9%\n| 40.0%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]\n| 62.6%\n| 05.5%\n| 31.6%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Nuevo Santander]]\n| 25.8%\n| 23.3%\n| 50.8%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Texas]]\n| 39.7%\n| 27.3%\n| 32.4%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Tlaxcala]]\n| 13.6%\n| 72.4%\n| 13.8%\n|-\n|}\n~<small>Europeans are included within the Mestizo category.</small>\n\nRegardless of the possible imprecisions related to the counting of Indigenous peoples living outside the colonized areas, the effort that New Spain's authorities put on considering them as subjects is worth mentioning, as censuses made by other colonial or post-colonial countries did not consider American Indians to be citizens/subjects, as example the censuses made by the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] would only count the inhabitants of the colonized settlements.<ref name=scarecrow>''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''.

However, it can be safely assumed that Mestizos make up at least the remaining 30% unassessed percentage of Mexico's population with possibilities of increasing if the methodologies of the extant surveys are considered. As example the 2015 intercensal survey considered as Indigenous Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans altogether individuals who self-identified as \"part Indigenous\" or \"part African\" thus, said people technically would be Mestizos. Similarly, White Mexicans were quantified based on physical traits/appearance, thus technically a Mestizo with a percentage of Indigenous ancestry that was low enough to not affect his/her primarily European phenotype was considered to be white. Finally, the remaining ethnicities, for being of a rather low number or being faiths have more permissive classification criteria, therefore a Mestizo could claim to belong to one of them by practicing the faith, or by having an ancestor who belonged to said ethnicities.\n\nNonetheless, contemporary sociologists and historians agree that, given that the concept of \"race\" has a psychological foundation rather than a biological one and to society's eyes a Mestizo with a high percentage of European ancestry is considered \"white\" and a Mestizo with a high percentage of Indigenous ancestry is considered \"Indian\", a person that identifies with a given ethnic group should be allowed to, even if biologically he doesn't completely belong to that group.<ref>{{cite web|title=El mestizaje en Mexico|url=http://enp4.unam.mx/amc/libro_munioz_cota/libro/cap4/lec10_federiconavarreteelmestizaje.pdf|website=Enp4.unam.mx|accessdate=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801102632/http://enp4.unam.mx/amc/libro_munioz_cota/libro/cap4/lec10_federiconavarreteelmestizaje.pdf|archive-date=1 August 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Population genetics & phenotype==\n===Genetic studies===\n[[File:Genetic variation of mestizo populations in Latin America.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The Mexican mestizo population is the most diverse of all the mestizo groups of Latin America, with its mestizos being either largely European or Amerindian rather than having a uniform admixture.

Those studies have recently gained the attention of Mexico's government which has begun conducting its own nationwide investigations, with the aim of document dynamics and inequalities on interactions between Mexicans of different ethnicities/races as well as to have a more concise idea of the ethnic composition of the country (a field that has been long neglected at an institutional level in Mexico). The results of these studies effectively refute misconceptions regarding Mexico's population, showing that Mexico is an exceptionally diverse country, where any color or type of trait can be found with ease in any region.\n\nSome studies, such as the one published by the [[American Sociological Association]] refute misconceptions that are very prevalent even among Mexicans themselves, as it found the differences in the frequencies of phenotypical traits such as [[Blond|blond hair]] between the population of the Northern regions of Mexico (where this trait has a frequency of 22.3% - 23.9%) and the population of the Central regions of Mexico (with a frequency of 18.9% to 21.3%) are not as pronounced as are commonly thought to be. Per the methodology of the study, the presence of blond hair was required for a Mexican to be classified as white as \"unlike skin color, blond hair does not darken with sun exposure\"<ref name=\"journals.jstor.com\"/> With a similar methodology, other study, made by the [[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana|Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico]] calculated the frequency of blond hair at 23%, Mexicans with red [[Red Hair|red-hair]] were classified as \"other\".<ref name=\"scielo.org.mx\"/>\n\nA 2014 study made by the [[University College London]] analyzed the frequencies of several different phenotypical traits on populations of five different Latin American countries ([[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]). In the case of Mexico the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] collaborated in the investigation with the results being the following:<ref name=\"Linares et al, 2014\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The area that is now modern-day Mexico has cradled many predecessor civilizations, going back as far as the [[Olmec]] which influenced the latter civilizations of [[Teotihuacan]] (200 B.C. to 700 A.D.) and the much debated [[Toltec]] people who flourished around the 10th and 12th centuries A.D., and ending with the last great indigenous civilization before the [[Spanish Conquest]], the [[Aztec]]s (13 March 1325 to 13 August 1521). The Nahuatl language was a common tongue in the region of modern Central Mexico during the Aztec Empire, but after the arrival of Europeans the common language of the region became Spanish.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec empire]], the Spanish re-administered the land and expanded their own empire beyond the former boundaries of the Aztec, adding more territory to the Mexican sphere of influence which remained under the Spanish Crown for 300 years. Cultural diffusion and intermixing among the Amerindian populations with the European created the modern Mexican identity which is a mixture of regional indigenous and European cultures that evolved into a national culture during the Spanish period. This new identity was defined as \"''Mexican''\" shortly after the [[Mexican War of Independence]] and was more invigorated and developed after the [[Mexican Revolution]] when the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1917]] officially established Mexico as an indivisible pluricultural nation founded on its indigenous roots.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Definitions==\n[[File:Adriana_Louvier.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Adriana Louvier]] Mexican television actress and presenter.]]\n<!-- In this section there should be a detailed elaboration of the Mexican identity as Mexicans themselves see it. \"Mexican\" is not merely a nationality in the eyes of Mexicans, it is their ethnic identity.

In the proceeding sections is where race and ethnicity is tackled in more detail such as the racial composition of the Mexican majority as well as the regional cultures of different Mexican states and indigenous groups.-->\n\n''Mexicano'' (Mexican) is derived from the word ''[[Mexico]]'' itself.

The system of interconnected lakes, of which Texcoco formed the center, had the form of a rabbit, which the Mesoamericans [[pareidolia|pareidolically]] associated with the [[moon rabbit|Moon]].

In that time the term did not apply to a nationality nor to the geographical limits of the modern Mexican Republic. The term was used for the first time in the first document printed in [[Barcelona]] in 1566 which documented the expedition which launched from the port in [[Acapulco]] to find the best route which would favor a return journey from the [[East Indies|Spanish East Indies]] to [[New Spain]]. The document stated: \"''el venturoso descubrimiento que los Mexicanos han hecho''\" (the venturous discovery that the Mexicans have made). That discovery led to the [[Manila galleon]] trade route and those \"Mexicans\" referred to [[Criollo people|Criollos]], [[Mestizos]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|Amerindians]] alluding to a plurality of persons who participated for a common end: the conquest of the Philippines in 1565.

Such as the [[Costa Chica of Oaxaca]] and the [[Costa Chica of Guerrero]], Veracruz (e.g. [[Yanga, Veracruz|Yanga]]) and in some towns in northern Mexico. The existence of blacks in Mexico is unknown, denied or diminished in both Mexico and abroad for a number of reasons: their small numbers, heavy intermarriage with other ethnic groups and Mexico's tradition of defining itself as a \"mestizaje\" or mixing of European and indigenous. Mexico did have an active slave trade since the early Spanish period but from the beginning, intermarriage and mixed race offspring created an elaborate caste system. This system broke down in the very late Spanish period and after Independence the legal notion of race was eliminated. The creation of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past actively or passively eliminating its African one from popular consciousness.\n\nThe majority of Mexico's native Afro-descendants are ''Afromestizos'', i.e. \"mixed-race\". Individuals with significantly high amounts of African ancestry make up a very low percentage of the total Mexican population, the majority being recent black immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean and elsewhere in the Americas. According to the Intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government, Afro-Mexicans make up 1.2% of Mexico's population, the Afro-Mexican category in the Intercensal survey includes people who self-identified solely as African and people who self-identified as partially African. The survey also states that 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous, with 9.3% being speakers of [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]].<ref name=\"Encuesta Intercensal 2015\"/>\n\n===Asian Mexicans===\n{{main|Asian Mexicans}}\n[[File:Comunidad japonesa de Monterrey.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese Mexican]] youths in [[Monterrey]]]]\nAsian Mexicans make up less than 1% of the total population of modern [[Mexico]], nonetheless they are a notable minority.

She arrived in [[New Spain]] and eventually she gave rise to the \"[[China Poblana]]\".\n\nThese early individuals are not very apparent in modern Mexico for two main reasons: the widespread ''[[mestizaje]]'' of Mexico during the Spanish period and the common practice of ''Chino'' slaves to \"[[Passing (racial identity)|pass]]\" as ''Indios'' (the indigenous people of Mexico) in order to attain freedom. As had occurred with a large portion of Mexico's black population, over generations the Asian populace was absorbed into the general [[Mestizo]] population. Facilitating this [[miscegenation]] was the assimilation of Asians into the indigenous population. The indigenous people were legally protected from [[chattel slavery]], and by being recognized as part of this group, Asian slaves could claim they were wrongly enslaved.\n\nAsians, predominantly Chinese, became Mexico's fastest-growing immigrant group from the 1880s to the 1920s, exploding from about 1,500 in 1895 to more than 20,000 in 1910.<ref name=\"Buchenau\">{{cite journal |last1= Buchenau |first1=J\u00fcrgen |date=Spring 2001 |title= Small Numbers, Great Impact: Mexico and Its Immigrants, 1821-1973 |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rgolden/MexicoImmigration.pdf |journal=Journal of American Ethnic History |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=35 |pmid=17605190 }}</ref>\n\n==Today==\n[[File:Luismiguel9900.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Luis Miguel]], always referred to as ''The Sun of Mexico''.]]\n\nEthnic relations in modern Mexico have grown out of the historical context of the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|arrival of Europeans]], the subsequent Spanish period of cultural and genetic miscegenation within the frame work of the [[castas]] system, the revolutionary periods focus on incorporating all ethnic and racial group into a common Mexican national identity and the indigenous revival of the late 20th century.

Of it, only part of the original datasets survive. Thus most of what is known of it comes from essays made by researchers who used the census' findings as reference for their own works.

Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost, thus most of what is now known about it comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as Prussian geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Each author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country although they don't vary much, with Europeans ranging from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos ranging from 21% to 25%, Indians ranging from 51% to 61% and Africans being between 6,000 and 10,000, The estimations given for the total population range from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. It is concluded then, that across nearly three centuries of colonization, the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%-17% per century. The authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates, the reason for the indigenous population's numbers decreasing lies on them suffering of higher mortality rates, due living in remote locations rather than on cities and towns founded by the Spanish colonists or being at war with them. It is also for these reasons that the number of Indigenous Mexicans presents the greater variation range between publications, as in cases their numbers in a given location were estimated rather than counted, leading to possible overestimations in some provinces and possible underestimations in others.<ref>[http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf \"Consideraciones sobre la poblaci\u00f3n de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a (1793-1810)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731104825/http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf |date=31 July 2017 }}, ''El Colegio de Mexico'', Mexico, Retrieved on 24 July 2017.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:center; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Intendecy/territory\n!European population (%)\n!Indigenous population (%)\n!Mestizo population (%)\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[State of M\u00e9xico|M\u00e9xico]] (only the [[State of Mexico]] and [[Mexico City]])\n| 16.9%\n| 66.1%\n| 16.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Puebla]]\n| 10.1%\n| 74.3%\n| 15.3%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Oaxaca]]\n| 06.3%\n| 88.2%\n| 05.2%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Guanajuato]]\n| 25.8%\n| 44.0%\n| 29.9%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]\n| 13.0%\n| 51.2%\n| 35.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Zacatecas]]\n| 15.8%\n| 29.0%\n| 55.1%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Durango]]\n| 20.2%\n| 36.0%\n| 43.5%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Sonora]]\n| 28.5%\n| 44.9%\n| 26.4%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Yucat\u00e1n]]\n| 14.8%\n| 72.6%\n| 12.3%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Guadalajara]]\n| 31.7%\n| 33.3%\n| 34.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Veracruz]]\n| 10.4%\n| 74.0%\n| 15.2%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Michoacan|Valladolid]]\n| 27.6%\n| 42.5%\n| 29.6%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[New Mexico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]\n| ~\n| 30.8%\n| 69.0%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Baja California|Vieja California]]\n| ~\n| 51.7%\n| 47.9%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Alta California|Nueva California]]\n| ~\n| 89.9%\n| 09.8%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Coahuila]]\n| 30.9%\n| 28.9%\n| 40.0%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]\n| 62.6%\n| 05.5%\n| 31.6%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Nuevo Santander]]\n| 25.8%\n| 23.3%\n| 50.8%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Texas]]\n| 39.7%\n| 27.3%\n| 32.4%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Tlaxcala]]\n| 13.6%\n| 72.4%\n| 13.8%\n|-\n|}\n~<small>Europeans are included within the Mestizo category.</small>\n\nRegardless of the possible imprecisions related to the counting of Indigenous peoples living outside the colonized areas, the effort that New Spain's authorities put on considering them as subjects is worth mentioning, as censuses made by other colonial or post-colonial countries did not consider American Indians to be citizens/subjects, as example the censuses made by the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] would only count the inhabitants of the colonized settlements.<ref name=scarecrow>''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''.

However, it can be safely assumed that Mestizos make up at least the remaining 30% unassessed percentage of Mexico's population with possibilities of increasing if the methodologies of the extant surveys are considered. As example the 2015 intercensal survey considered as Indigenous Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans altogether individuals who self-identified as \"part Indigenous\" or \"part African\" thus, said people technically would be Mestizos. Similarly, White Mexicans were quantified based on physical traits/appearance, thus technically a Mestizo with a percentage of Indigenous ancestry that was low enough to not affect his/her primarily European phenotype was considered to be white. Finally, the remaining ethnicities, for being of a rather low number or being faiths have more permissive classification criteria, therefore a Mestizo could claim to belong to one of them by practicing the faith, or by having an ancestor who belonged to said ethnicities.\n\nNonetheless, contemporary sociologists and historians agree that, given that the concept of \"race\" has a psychological foundation rather than a biological one and to society's eyes a Mestizo with a high percentage of European ancestry is considered \"white\" and a Mestizo with a high percentage of Indigenous ancestry is considered \"Indian\", a person that identifies with a given ethnic group should be allowed to, even if biologically he doesn't completely belong to that group.<ref>{{cite web|title=El mestizaje en Mexico|url=http://enp4.unam.mx/amc/libro_munioz_cota/libro/cap4/lec10_federiconavarreteelmestizaje.pdf|website=Enp4.unam.mx|accessdate=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801102632/http://enp4.unam.mx/amc/libro_munioz_cota/libro/cap4/lec10_federiconavarreteelmestizaje.pdf|archive-date=1 August 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Population genetics & phenotype==\n===Genetic studies===\n[[File:Genetic variation of mestizo populations in Latin America.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The Mexican mestizo population is the most diverse of all the mestizo groups of Latin America, with its mestizos being either largely European or Amerindian rather than having a uniform admixture.

Those studies have recently gained the attention of Mexico's government which has begun conducting its own nationwide investigations, with the aim of document dynamics and inequalities on interactions between Mexicans of different ethnicities/races as well as to have a more concise idea of the ethnic composition of the country (a field that has been long neglected at an institutional level in Mexico). The results of these studies effectively refute misconceptions regarding Mexico's population, showing that Mexico is an exceptionally diverse country, where any color or type of trait can be found with ease in any region.\n\nSome studies, such as the one published by the [[American Sociological Association]] refute misconceptions that are very prevalent even among Mexicans themselves, as it found the differences in the frequencies of phenotypical traits such as [[Blond|blond hair]] between the population of the Northern regions of Mexico (where this trait has a frequency of 22.3% - 23.9%) and the population of the Central regions of Mexico (with a frequency of 18.9% to 21.3%) are not as pronounced as are commonly thought to be. Per the methodology of the study, the presence of blond hair was required for a Mexican to be classified as white as \"unlike skin color, blond hair does not darken with sun exposure\"<ref name=\"journals.jstor.com\"/> With a similar methodology, other study, made by the [[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana|Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico]] calculated the frequency of blond hair at 23%, Mexicans with red [[Red Hair|red-hair]] were classified as \"other\".<ref name=\"scielo.org.mx\"/>\n\nA 2014 study made by the [[University College London]] analyzed the frequencies of several different phenotypical traits on populations of five different Latin American countries ([[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]). In the case of Mexico the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] collaborated in the investigation with the results being the following:<ref name=\"Linares et al, 2014\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

{{nihongo|Jinch\u016b Railroad|\u795e\u4e2d\u9244\u9053|}}, now Sagami Railway). The Odakyu Line {{nihongo|Ebina-Kokubun Station|\u6d77\u8001\u540d\u56fd\u5206\u99c5|}}, which had been in operation since 1927, was shifted 400 meters on April 1, 1943, for joint operation of Ebina Station. From December 1971, Ebina became one of the chief [[rail yard]]s of the Odakyu line. On December 21, 1973, a new station was opened, located approximately 400 meters from the old station in the direction of Odawara. From March 21, 1987, the Sagami Line began operations to Ebina, less than a month before the dissolution and [[privatization]] of the [[Japanese National Railways]] and formation of the [[East Japan Railway Company]].\n\n\nThe Odakyu Ebina Station has a unique platform jingle that plays when trains are arriving. The melody is from the song [[Sakura (Ikimono-gakari song)|Sakura]] by the Japanese pop band, Ikimonogakari (\u3044\u304d\u3082\u306e\u304c\u304b\u308a). The Odawara bound platforms 1 and 2 play the intro to the song while the Shinjuku / Chiyoda Line bound platforms 3 and 4 play a short portion from the middle of the song.\n\n==External

{{nihongo|Jinch\u016b Railroad|\u795e\u4e2d\u9244\u9053|}}, now Sagami Railway). The Odakyu Line {{nihongo|Ebina-Kokubun Station|\u6d77\u8001\u540d\u56fd\u5206\u99c5|}}, which had been in operation since 1927, was shifted 400 meters on April 1, 1943, for joint operation of Ebina Station. From December 1971, Ebina became one of the chief [[rail yard]]s of the Odakyu line. On December 21, 1973, a new station was opened, located approximately 400 meters from the old station in the direction of Odawara. From March 21, 1987, the Sagami Line began operations to Ebina, less than a month before the dissolution and [[privatization]] of the [[Japanese National Railways]] and formation of the [[East Japan Railway Company]].\n\n\nThe Odakyu Ebina Station has a unique platform jingle that plays when trains are arriving. The melody is from the song [[Sakura (Ikimono-gakari song)|Sakura]] by the Japanese pop band, Ikimonogakari (\u3044\u304d\u3082\u306e\u304c\u304b\u308a). The Odawara bound platforms 1 and 2 play the intro to the song while the Shinjuku / Chiyoda Line bound platforms 3 and 4 play a short portion from the middle of the song.\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091003162421/http://www.odakyu.jp/guide/station/ebina_map_3d.html Ebina Station (Odakyu)] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.jreast.co.jp/estation/station/info.aspx?StationCd=291 Ebina Station (JR East)] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100126001229/http://www.sotetsu.co.jp/train/station/ebina/index.html Ebina Station (Sagami Railway)] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{Sagami Railway Main Line}}\n{{Odakyu Odawara Line}}\n{{Sagami Line}}\n\n{{coord|35|27|10|N|139|23|27|E|region:JP_source:jawiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1941]]\n[[Category:Odakyu Odawara Line]]\n[[Category:Stations of Odakyu Electric Railway]]\n[[Category:Sagami Railway Main Line]]\n[[Category:Stations of Sagami Railway]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in Kanagawa Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Sagami Line]]\n", "name_user": "Voyager", "label": "safe", "comment": "better photo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebina_Station"}

Allseas acquired the former bulk carrier \u201cNatalie Bolten\u201d in 1985 and converted it for DP pipelay at the Boele shipyard in Bolnes, the Netherlands. The vessel was christened ''[https://allseas.com/equipment/lorelay/ Lorelay]'' in Rotterdam on 26 April 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/swan-revival-means-1200-jobs-1340756.html|title=Swan revival means 1,200 jobs|website=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> ''Lorelay'' immediately entered service and successfully executed her first pipelay contract, the 8-inch, 1.8-km Helder A-B pipeline, for Unocal in the Dutch sector of the North Sea.\n\nIn 1987, the company declared its intention to build a vessel capable of lifting entire offshore platforms.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on'' ''the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had grown weary of his character Sherlock Holmes.

However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Three Act Tragedy|last=Christie, Agatha|date=2018|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new\".<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\").

While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a solid background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up-to-date at Torquay Hospital.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|235,470}}\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons \u2026 These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories\".<ref name=\":11\" /> There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists and scientists, na\u00efve or suspicious, in Christie's future: ''Murder in Mesopotamia'', ''Cards on the Table'', ''The Pale Horse'', and ''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', among numerous others.\n\nGillian Gill also notes that the murder method in Christie's very first detective novel, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|34}} In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths \u2026 I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Agatha Christie: \u2018Queen of Crime\u2019 Is a Gentlewoman|date=8 March 1970|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url-status=live|page=60, quoted in Gerald (1993), p. 4.}}</ref> With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under [[Ronald Knox]]'s \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".<ref name=\":12\" />{{Rp|58}} Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, thallium, and many other standard pharmaceuticals were utilised to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades. \n\n===Archaeology===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 30%|\n| source = \n| quote = The lure of the past came up to grab me.

She met her second husband, Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dever|first=Norma|date=2004|title=They Also Dug!

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie.

She also read the work of [[Edith Nesbit]], including ''[[The Story of the Treasure Seekers]]'' (1899), ''[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]'' (1903), and ''[[The Railway Children]]'' (1906).

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Three Act Tragedy|last=Christie, Agatha|date=2018|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new\".<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works.

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\").

Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up-to-date at Torquay Hospital.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|235,470}}\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons \u2026 These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories\".<ref name=\":11\" /> There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists and scientists, na\u00efve or suspicious, in Christie's future: ''Murder in Mesopotamia'', ''Cards on the Table'', ''The Pale Horse'', and ''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', among numerous others.\n\nGillian Gill also notes that the murder method in Christie's very first detective novel, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|34}} In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths \u2026 I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Agatha Christie: \u2018Queen of Crime\u2019 Is a Gentlewoman|date=8 March 1970|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url-status=live|page=60, quoted in Gerald (1993), p. 4.}}</ref> With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under [[Ronald Knox]]'s \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".<ref name=\":12\" />{{Rp|58}} Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, thallium, and many other standard pharmaceuticals were utilised to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades. \n\n===Archaeology===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 30%|\n| source = \n| quote = The lure of the past came up to grab me.

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).
