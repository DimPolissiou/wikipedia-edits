The geography of Ferrol meant that an entire Spanish fleet could slip out on a single tide. By the time the British were able to resume the blockade, the Spanish would be safely away and out to sea. Despite these advantages, a decline set during the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]], and in 1800, during the [[Ferrol Expedition (1800)]], after the defences had been reduced, a British fleet of 109 vessels landed troops on the beach of [[Doninos, Esmelle and St. George's Beach|Doni\u00f1os]] to take the Castle of San Felipe. Although only equipped with meagre artillery, the castle's small defence force under the command of [[Andrade|Count Donadio]] together with a sizable number of volunteer citizens of Ferrol, successfully resisted the attack and the fleet withdrew. The alliance with the [[United Kingdom]] during the [[Peninsular War]] of 1808\u20131814 failed to prevent the deterioration in the town\u2019s fortunes.

The geography of Ferrol meant that an entire Spanish fleet could slip out on a single tide. By the time the British were able to resume the blockade, the Spanish would be safely away and out to sea. Despite these advantages, a decline set during the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]], and in 1800, during the [[Ferrol Expedition (1800)]], after the defences had been reduced, a British fleet of 109 vessels landed troops on the beach of Doni\u00f1os to take the Castle of San Felipe. Although only equipped with meagre artillery, the castle's small defence force under the command of [[Andrade|Count Donadio]] together with a sizable number of volunteer citizens of Ferrol, successfully resisted the attack and the fleet withdrew. The alliance with the [[United Kingdom]] during the [[Peninsular War]] of 1808\u201314 failed to prevent the deterioration in the town\u2019s fortunes.

Telecom Egypt will be able to offer mobile services under the terms of the new licence, he said, and will be using new 4G spectrum from 2015, and that would lead to a break-up of the relationship with [[Vodafone]], by Telecom Egypt either buying the rest of the Vodafone Egypt stake or selling its stake to the Vodafone group.\n\n==Products and services==\nTelecom Egypt is Egypt's only fixed-line operator, and one of the largest in the [[MENA]] region with over 9 million subscribers as of 2009.
