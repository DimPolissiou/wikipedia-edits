The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]<ref name=\"Zelensky bowed until luck\" />}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal|to influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into one of Trump's political opponents, [[Joe Biden]], and to promote [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|a discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].\n\nThe inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019, in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August 2019 whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13\u20139 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23\u201317 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a near-party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).\n\nThe articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit. Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/no-senator-ever-voted-remove-president-his-party-office-until-mitt-romney/|title=No senator ever voted to remove a president of his own party from office.

The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]<ref name=\"Zelensky bowed until luck\" />}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal|to influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into one of Trump's political opponents, [[Joe Biden]], and to promote [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|a discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].\n\nThe inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019, in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August 2019 whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13\u20139 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23\u201317 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a near-party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).\n\nThe articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit. Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/no-senator-ever-voted-remove-president-his-party-office-until-mitt-romney/|title=No senator ever voted to remove a president of his own party from office.

{"title_page": "Seah", "text_new": "== '''SeAH Besteel''' ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\nListed on the KOSPI, SeAH Besteel specializes in the production of special steel products for the automobile, machinery, construction, and shipbuilding industries. Its main business areas are special steel, heavy forging, auto parts and others, which account for 97.8%, 0.6%, 1.3%, and 0.3% of sales respectively. The term \u2018forging\u2019 refers to a manufacturing process involving the shaping of metal by beating and pressing. Special steel is characterized by its high levels of durability and thermal resistance, compared to general steel products, and is used in the production of automobile and ship engine parts, heavy equipment parts for construction, and offshore plants. As it has special properties above and beyond those of general steel products, it is classified as a product group with higher added value. \n<br />\n\n=== '''SeAH Besteel\u2019s Gunsan Plant''' ===\nSeAH Besteel\u2019s special steel products and heavy forging products are the key materials for the main national industries and diverse means of transportation. Its large special steel plant in Gunsan, South Korea, is equipped with an optimal automated system that produces over 3.1 million tons of steel and 2.8 million tons of steel products per year, making SeAH Besteel the no. 1 company with its largest share in the domestic special steel market. The company also manufactures super-large high-quality forging products with its 13,000-ton press. SeAH Besteel has earned high praise for its integrated production system encompassing steelmaking, pressing, and processing, as well as its unique technological expertise. \n\nIn 2015, SeAH Besteel acquired POSCO Specialty Steel with an investment of about KRW 1 trillion, and expanded its special steel production portfolio to include stainless products (STS) as well as carbon alloy steel. POSCO Specialty Steel has since been renamed as SeAH Changwon Integrated Special Steel (SeAH CSS), which is a subsidiary company of SeAH Besteel. Since its incorporation into SeAH, SeAH CSS\u2019s revenue has been turned around, and its sales continue to record an upward trend. In fact, SeAH CSS recorded sales of KRW 971.6 billion in 2015, KRW 914.6 billion in 2016, KRW 1.1178 trillion in 2017, and KRW 1.2293 trillion in 2018. \n\nSeAH Besteel is one of the main affiliate companies of SeAH Holdings. SeAH Group\u2019s main business areas are special steel and steel pipe, with the former led by SeAH Holdings and the latter by SeAH Steel Holdings. As the Group is run by cousins, there was once some talk about splitting the group, but the members of the owning family have officially excluded any such possibility. In fact, SeAH Holdings and SeAH Steel Holdings have teamed up with each other to participate in international trade shows and win contracts together, thereby generating a powerful synergy.\n\nThe largest shareholder of SeAH Besteel is SeAH Holdings, whose largest individual shareholder is CEO Taesung Lee. As the former chairman Woon Hyung Lee, father of Taesung Lee, suddenly passed away in 2013, CEO Lee had to pay KRW 150 billion in inheritance tax. In fact, it has been reported that CEO Lee paid a total of KRW 170 billion in inheritance tax, including the interest, in yearly installments up until September 2018. At that time, CEO Lee said, \u201cTo be honest, such a huge amount of tax was a heavy burden for me, but it made me realize once again how truly valuable SeAH is.\u201d\n\nThe headquarters of SeAH Besteel is located at SeAH Tower (28F ~ 29F), 45, Yanghwa-ro, Mapo-gu, Seoul, South Korea.\n<br />\n\n=== History ===\n\n* 1955 Established Daehan Heavy Machinery Industry Co ,Ltd\n* 1958 Completed the construction of a small rolling mill\n* 1964 Completed the construction of a railroad and wheel plant\n* 1974 Completed the construction of a 30-ton electric furnace and a large rolling mill\n* 1978 Commenced the production of castings (Incheon Plant)\n* 1981 Completed the construction of a 40-ton electric furnace\n* 1982 Started production of special steel (Seoul Plant)\n* 1986 Completed the construction of the axle casing Plant\n* 1988 Completed the construction of the hot-forging plant\n* 1989 Established the Metal Research Institute.\n* 1990 Renamed as Kia Special Steel Co., Ltd.\n* 1991 Initial public offering; started producing impression die forgings\n* 1993 Relocated the HQ to Gunsan; completed the construction of the special steel plant (1st stage)\n* 1994 Completed the construction of the special steel plant (2nd stage)\n\n- Received the Presidential Award for facility control (TPM)\n\n- Completed the axle assembly plant\n\n* 1995 Obtained the ISO9002 certification; completed the cold strip forging and casting plant\n* 1996 Received the $50 Million Export Tower Award\n* 1997 Completed the construction of the Gunsan special steel plant; received an award for industrial peace\n* 1999 Obtained the QS-9000 certification; received the $70 Million Export Tower Award\n* 2000 Opened the Institute Credibility Evaluation Center\n* 2001 Authorized to serve as an ISO/EC 17025 state correction organization\n* 2003 Incorporated into SeAH Group; received the $100 Million Export Tower Award\n* 2004 Renamed as SeAH Besteel\n* 2005 Obtained the ISO/TS16949 certification\n* 2006 Obtained the ISO 14001 environment management system certification.\n* 2008 Established a system with a production capacity of 2 million tons of steel and 1.8 million tons of steel products; received the $300 Million Export Tower Award.\n* 2010 Completed the construction of the heavy forging plant (13,000-ton, 150-ton electric furnace)\n* 2011 Established a system capable of producing 2.5 million tons of steel (special steel: 2.2 million tons, forging: 0.3 million tons)\n* 2013 Completed the construction of the Changnyeong Plant\n* 2015 Took over POSCO Specialty Steel (renamed as SeAH Changwon Integrated Special Steel)\n* 2016 Established the US Sales office, SeAH Global, Inc. \n* 2017 Obtained the IATF 16949 Automotive Quality Management System Certification\n* 2018 Established SeAH Global Thai\n\n<br />\n\n=== Business ===\n'''SeAH Besteel\u2019s key business is the production of special steel products.''' Special steel or alloy steel is steel that is alloyed with other metals or made using a special heat treatment to improve the strength of steel. For example, nickel chrome steel is made by adding small amounts of nickel and chrome to steel and subjecting it to heat treatment to make it tougher and stronger than carbon steel. It is used in cogwheels and other products that receive a great amount of pressure from the power transmission gears of automobiles or ships. SeAH Besteel is capable of providing up to 2.8 million tons of rolled bars and forged bars of different sizes annually. Its main products are automobile H steel, bearing steel, drill collar bars for oil drilling, rolled steel for wind mill gear, and rolled steel for rock drilling. Notably, in 2018, the company subdivided its special steel products into six product categories and launched six major special steel specialty products whose functionality and efficiency have been greatly improved, with the aim of enhancing customer convenience.  The six major special steel specialty products are Anti-Wear-resistance steel, Tenacity steel, Free Surface defect steel, steel with low-thermal distortion, low-anisotropic steel, and highly-clean bearing steel. \n\n1) Premium clean bearing steel: This type of steel is manufactured in an ultra-clean production environment that can control even micro-scale foreign matter, and guarantees an almost unlimited lifespan for bearings. Its main source of demand is the automobile industry, but it is expanding to the industrial machinery and railroad industries, too.\n\n2) Steel with low-thermal distortion: This type of steel is used for the gear shafts of automobile transmission gears. It is manufactured by minimizing the problem of thermal distortion.\n\n3) Anti-Wear resistance steel: This type of steel is used for rock breakers and rock breaking used in heavy construction equipment and mines. As it is used in environments requiring extreme durability, it has low abrasion loss when subjected to strong impacts and a long service life.\n\n4) Tenacity steel: This type of steel boasts excellent durability and does not get damaged even in extreme temperatures for oil drilling, offshore wind power and offshore plants, etc. in Polar Regions and deep seas.\n\n5) Low-anisotropic steel: This type of steel is used as a material in the production of automobile crankshafts and motor shafts. Existing special steels are limited in their ability to add uniform mechanical properties in the longitudinal and lateral directions due to the nature of the material, but low-anisotropic steel is evenly durable regardless of the direction. \n\n6) Free surface defect steel: This type of steel has no surface defects and thus does not have to undergo a peeling process, unlike other special steel products. \n\n\nThe company has increased its investment in '''the heavy forging business since selecting it as a new growth engine in 2008'''. A representative of SeAH Besteel said, \u201cIt is because the integrated process from steelmaking to forging is essential for producing high-quality products.\u201d The company is planning to run the business structure with two main pillars \u2013 the special steel business and the heavy forging business. The company has built and operates a 150 ton electric arc furnace and a 13,000 ton hydraulic forging press, and produces ingot and forged products of diverse sizes. It has also been built a one-stop system for the forging process, starting from steelmaking to heat treatment and processing. In particular, thanks to such a forging process, SeAH Besteel won Korea\u2019s first ever contract to produce spent nuclear fuel CASK from the U.S.A., an advanced nuclear power plant market, in October 2019. The company won the contract by establishing a supply partnership and cooperative system with Orano TN, a global company specializing in the back-end nuclear fuel cycle. Spent nuclear fuel CASK, i.e. canisters designed for the safe storage and transportation of nuclear fuel used to operate nuclear power plants, are an essential element of nuclear decommissioning and the maintenance of nuclear power plants. As safety is a top priority in the nuclear component market, SeAH Besteel\u2019s entry into the nuclear power parts market is expected to have a positive impact on the company\u2019s future sales growth. \n\nWhile SeAH Besteel produces carbon alloy special steel products, '''its subsidiary company SeAH Changwon Integrated Special Steel (SeAH CSS) manufactures stainless (STS), special steel products''' used in industries including construction, home appliances, power generation, machinery, shipbuilding, etc. Located in Changwon, SeAH CSS Plant (with a surface area of about 641,322m<sup>2</sup>) is capable of producing 1.2 million tons of steel per year. As it is Korea\u2019s only producer of stainless bar steel and steel wire products, the company has acquired the largest share of the market for stainless steel, tool steel, and special alloy products. Its products are commonly used in machine parts, shafts, bolts, nuts, buildings, power generation turbines, and ship shafts among others. SeAH CSS was Korea\u2019s first company to be certified as a vendor of stainless seamless pipes of all types by the world\u2019s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, in June 2019.  This is considered to be a very positive development for future sales as it was achieved despite the local restrictions on the registration of overseas companies as new vendors due to Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent localization reinforcement policy. The company\u2019s seamless pipes are classified into a premium steel product group with high pressure and corrosion resistance, compared to general steel pipes.\n\n'''SeAH Besteel entered the aluminum material production business in October 2019'''. Since acquiring Arconic Korea, a manufacturer of aluminum products, SeAH Besteel has been able to expand its production portfolio of special steels including carbon alloys, stainless, and aluminum. The company has stated that expanding its portfolio of metal products has enabled it to secure a new growth engine and lay a solid foundation for sustainable growth. As the aluminum materials produced by Arconic Korea are high value-added materials not intended for general purposes, and its main customers are the automotive, aviation, and defense industries, which have the same source of demand as SeAH Besteel, it is expected that they will generate synergy for the creation of customer value and sales.\n\nGenerally, SeAH Besteel has focused on domestic business, rather than conducting active marketing aimed at exports, due to the high domestic demand. However, since 2016, the company has strengthened its global marketing organization and been striving to change its constitution with an active business sales approach, leading it to sign contracts with OEMs for global automakers in Europe and Japan among others. Before 2013, SeAH Besteel carried out its marketing for auto parts and machineries based on the European distributors, while from 2013 to 2015, the company went through testing forging companies whose end users are global automakers. Since the third quarter of 2015, however, the company has begun to win contracts and the category has gradually been expanded. This was the result of nearly two years of testing in order to meet the strict, high standards of global automakers. SeAH Besteel is currently supplying products to eleven OEMs of global automakers in Europe and the U.S.A. It seems that the company is expanding its global contact points by increasing its participation in international exhibitions as SeAH Group\u2019s single team. \n<br />\n\n=== Business Performance ===\nAs of 2018, SeAH Besteel\u2019s total sales amounted to KRW 3.27 trillion, with the sales for each quarter of the year exceeding KRW 500 billion without any ups and downs. SeAH Besteel and SeAH Special Steel are core subsidiaries of SeAH Holdings, as their sales now account for 70% and 26% of SeAH Holding\u2019s operating profits. The decrease in operating profit in 2018 seems to be due to the one-off cost incurred by the partial loss of ordinary wages. Industry analysts concluded that as Hyundai Steel entered the special steel business in 2013, it would encroach on SeAH\u2019s sales to Hyundai Motor Group. At that time Hyundai Motor\u2019s orders accounted for about 25% of SeAH Besteel\u2019s overall sales, so it was expected that its sales would suffer badly. However, it took longer than expected to commercialize Hyundai Steel\u2019s products in the certification and testing process of special steel products required for durability and corrosion resistance. Meanwhile, SeAH Besteel cultivated the European markets for advanced automotive parts in order replace the share it had lost to Hyundai Steel. In fact, Hyundai Steel completed its ISIR (Initial Sample Inspection Report) at the end of 2018, which was later than originally planned, but deliveries to Hyundai Motor Group were delayed due to cracks on the surface of its special steel wire rod products. Meanwhile, SeAH Besteel has established a sales subsidiary in North America, an office in Germany, and a plant in Thailand among others, and has been delivering products together with the European OEM company for automotive parts after two years of testing. Thanks to these efforts, SeAH Besteel\u2019s ability to cope with the market has been widely praised, as the company\u2019s total special steel production increased in the three preceding years (1.93 million tons in 2016, 2.17 million tons in 2017, and 2.16 million tons in 2018), and its export proportion also increased from 17% to 22.3%.\n\n\n- (2018) Total sales: KRW 3.2781 trillion; business profits: KRW 55.9 billion\n\n- (2017) Total sales: KRW 3.0553 trillion; business profits: KRW 188.5 billion\n\n- (2016) total sales: KRW 2.5311 trillion; business profits: KRW 143.5 billion\n\n\n=== Slogan ===\nSeAH Group\u2019s slogan is \u201cMake the World a Better Place,\u201d which derives from the two syllables of the company\u2019s name: the first, \u201cSe\u201d, means \u201cthe world\u201d in Korean, while the second, \u201cAH\u201d, is the first syllable of the Korean word for \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n", "text_old": "'''Seah''' can refer to:\n\n*Seah, a variant of the Chinese surname [[She (surname)|She]] (\u4f58)\n*[[Seah (unit)]], a unit of dry volume of ancient origin used in Jewish law\n\n{{disambiguation}}\n", "name_user": "Lemonpoundcake", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(SeAH, SeAH Besteel)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seah"}

Walker understood the power of advertising and brand awareness. Heavy advertising, primarily in African-American newspapers and magazines, in addition to Walker's frequent travels to promote her products, helped make Walker and her products well known in the United States.\n\nIn addition to training in sales and grooming, Walker showed other black women how to budget, build their own businesses, and encouraged them to become financially independent. In 1917, inspired by the model of the [[National Association of Colored Women]], Walker began organizing her sales agents into state and local clubs. The result was the establishment of the National Beauty Culturists and Benevolent Association of Madam C. J. Walker Agents (predecessor to the Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Culturists Union of America).<ref name=\"indiana-history\" /> Its first annual conference convened in [[Philadelphia]] during the summer of 1917 with 200 attendees.

She initially purchased a house and factory at 640 North West Street.<ref name=GS361>Gugin and Saint Clair, p. 361.</ref> Walker later built a factory, hair salon, and beauty school to train her sales agents, and added a laboratory to help with research.<ref name=ingham/> She also assembled a staff that included [[Freeman Ransom]], [[Robert Brokenburr|Robert Lee Brokenburr]], Alice Kelly, and [[Marjorie Joyner]], among others, to assist in managing the growing company.<ref name=BWA1210-11/> Many of her company's employees, including those in key management and staff positions, were women.<ref name=Success/>\n[[File:MadameCJWalkerdrivingautomoblie.png|thumb|left|Madam Walker and several friends in her automobile, 1911.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/03/self-made-madam-cj-walker-company-true-story Vanity Fair, Self Made: What Happened to Madam C.J.

This method claimed to make lackluster and brittle hair become soft and luxurious.<ref name=bundles/><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/> Walker's product line had several competitors. Similar products were produced in Europe and manufactured by other companies in the United States, which included her major rivals, Annie Turnbo Malone's Poro System from which she derived her original formula and later, Sarah Spencer Washington's Apex System.<ref name=Science/>\n\nBetween 1911 and 1919, during the height of her career, Walker and her company employed several thousand women as sales agents for its products.<ref name=indiana-history/> By 1917 the company claimed to have trained nearly 20,000 women.<ref name=GS361/> Dressed in a characteristic uniform of white shirts and black skirts and carrying black satchels, they visited houses around the United States and in the [[Caribbean]] offering Walker's hair pomade and other products packaged in tin containers carrying her image. Walker understood the power of advertising and brand awareness. Heavy advertising, primarily in African-American newspapers and magazines, in addition to Walker's frequent travels to promote her products, helped make Walker and her products well known in the United States.\n\nIn addition to training in sales and grooming, Walker showed other black women how to budget, build their own businesses, and encouraged them to become financially independent. In 1917, inspired by the model of the [[National Association of Colored Women]], Walker began organizing her sales agents into state and local clubs. The result was the establishment of the National Beauty Culturists and Benevolent Association of Madam C. J. Walker Agents (predecessor to the Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Culturists Union of America).<ref name=\"indiana-history\" /> Its first annual conference convened in [[Philadelphia]] during the summer of 1917 with 200 attendees. The conference is believed to have been among the first national gatherings of women entrepreneurs to discuss business and commerce.<ref name=\"Riquier\" /><ref name=\"bundles\" /> During the convention Walker gave prizes to women who had sold the most products and brought in the most new sales agents. She also rewarded those who made the largest contributions to charities in their communities.<ref name=\"bundles\" />\n\nWalker's name became even more widely known by the 1920s, after her death, as her company's business market expanded beyond the United States to [[Cuba]], [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], [[Panama]], and [[Costa Rica]].<ref name=\"bundles\" /><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\" /><ref name=\"Success\" /><ref name=\"Science\">{{cite web | title=Madame C.

In 1912, Walker addressed an annual gathering of the [[National Negro Business League]] (NNBL) from the convention floor, where she declared: \"I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there, I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there, I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations. I have built my own factory on my own ground.\"<ref name=GS361/> The following year she addressed convention-goers from the podium as a keynote speaker.<ref name=bundles/><ref name=\"Her Own Ground 2001\"/>\n\nShe helped raise funds to establish a branch of [[YMCA]] in Indianapolis's black community, pledging $1,000 to the building fund for Senate Avenue YMCA. Walker also contributed scholarship funds to the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]]. Other beneficiaries included Indianapolis's Flanner House and [[Bethel A.M.E. Church (Indianapolis, Indiana)|Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church]]; Mary McLeod Bethune's Daytona Education and Industrial School for Negro Girls (which later became [[Bethune-Cookman University]]) in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]; the [[Palmer Memorial Institute]] in [[North Carolina]]; and the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Walker was also a [[patron of the arts]].<ref name=indiana-history/><ref name=bundles/>\n\nAbout 1913, Walker's daughter, A'Lelia, moved to a new townhouse in [[Harlem]], and in 1916, Walker joined her in New York, leaving the day-to-day operation of her company to her management team in Indianapolis.<ref name=Bundles-website/><ref name=GS361/> In 1917, Walker commissioned [[Vertner Tandy]], the first licensed black architect in New York City and a founding member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity, to design her house in [[Irvington-on-Hudson, New York|Irvington-on-Hudson]], New York. Walker intended for [[Villa Lewaro]], which cost $250,000 to build, to become a gathering place for community leaders and to inspire other African Americans to pursue their dreams.<ref name=Science/><ref>Bundles, \"Madam C J (Sarah Breedlove) Walker, 1867\u20131919\" in ''Black Women in America'', v.

She delivered lectures on political, economic, and social issues at conventions sponsored by powerful black institutions. Her friends and associates included [[Booker T. Washington]], [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].<ref name=indiana-history/> During [[World War I]] Walker was a leader in the Circle For Negro War Relief and advocated for the establishment of a training camp for black army officers.<ref name=GS361/> In 1917 she joined the executive committee of New York chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which organized the [[Silent Parade|Silent Protest Parade]] on New York City's [[Fifth Avenue]]. The public demonstration drew more than 8,000 African Americans to protest a riot in East Saint Louis that killed 39 African-Americans.<ref name=bundles/>\n\nProfits from her business significantly impacted Walker's contributions to her political and philanthropic interests. In 1918 the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs]] (NACWC) honored Walker for making the largest individual contribution to help preserve [[Frederick Douglass]]'s [[Anacostia]] house.<ref>Bundles, \"Madam C J (Sarah Breedlove) Walker, 1867\u20131919\" in ''Black Women in America'', v.

At the time it was the largest gift from an individual that the NAACP had ever received. Walker bequeathed nearly $100,000 to orphanages, institutions, and individuals; her will directed two-thirds of future net profits of her estate to charity.<ref name=Philanthropy>{{cite web | title=Madam C.
