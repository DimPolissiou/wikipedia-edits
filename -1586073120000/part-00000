The club name provides the overall umbrella for [[rugby union]], men's and ladies' [[hockey]] and [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. The club is associated on and off the field with [[Methodist College Belfast]] (MCB).\n\n==Background of the club==\n\nBelfast Harlequins was formed in 1999 with the merger of [[Collegians (Belfast)|Collegians]], [[North of Ireland Cricket Club]] and [[North of Ireland Football Club]]. The former clubs were three of the oldest and most distinguished clubs in Ireland. \"North\" sold its famous ground at Ormeau \u2013 one of the earliest international rugby venues<ref>See references to Ireland's matches against Scotland from 1877 to 1889: [https://archive.is/20120904033126/http://www.irishrugby.ie/18104_18114.php Ireland v Scotland \u2013 Head to Head Statistics]</ref> \u2013 to pay for the redevelopment of the Deramore Park facilities.\n\nThe club uses a version of the Maltese cross that MCB uses as its sports logo, with the colours being those of navy, sky blue, red and maroon. The North colours were traditionally red, blue and black, with Collegians using navy, white and maroon.\n\nAt two extraordinary general meetings held simultaneously in both North and Collegians, the members of both clubs voted to proceed with the merger to form the new club, Belfast Harlequins. As of 12.00 midnight, 18 November 1999, Belfast Harlequins came into existence. The first annual general meeting of the new club took place in March 2000. The new clubhouse at Deramore was opened in June 2002 by the then club president, Alison Watt, along with [[Jack Kyle|Jack Kyle OBE]] and Gilbert Paton.\n\nOn and off the field, all three sections of the Belfast Harlequins set-up have been successful. Pictures and memorabilia of both clubs and grounds is placed around the bar area and throughout the club. There is an active social scene, many parties and events take place throughout the season.\n\n==Grounds==\n\nDeramore is located in the heart of south Belfast, flanked by the River Lagan and Lagan Meadows to the east and south, and overlooked to the north and west by large detached homes.\n\nDeramore Park was the home to Collegians (and of [[Methodist College Belfast|Methodist College]] from 1919 until the school purchased Pirrie Park from [[Harland & Wolff]] in 1932). Deramore Park was bequested in trust for the use of the former pupils of Methody for its life by Mr C W Neill in 1941. A special board of trustees exists today in the name of C W Neill, and its consent was required for the merger in 1999, to allow the continued use of Deramore Park by the new club.\n\nDeramore Park has one squash court, three rugby pitches, one cricket pitch, one synthetic hockey pitch, a two-bedroom apartment and one bowling green which Belfast Bowling Club owns and plays on.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Belfast Harlequins hosted several sports in the [[Special Olympics]] Ireland Games. The games were held in [[Belfast]] for the first time in their history.\n\nDeramore Park was a venue for the [[2007 Under 19 Rugby World Championship]], which was hosted in Belfast.\n\n[[File:Harlequins Edit edited.JPG|250px|thumb|''The Welcome sign at Deramore for the Rugby World Cup 2007'']]\n[[File:BH12312.JPG|250px|thumb|''The 1000 seater stand at Deramore for the Rugby World Cup games of April 2007'']]\n[[File:MCB234512.jpg|250px|thumb|''Clubhouse view of the MCB Hockey Pitch'']]\n\n[[File:Bowling Green Snow.JPG|250px|thumb|''The Bowling Green covered in Snow'']]\n[[File:BH123523Back.JPG|250px|thumb|''The Back Pitches and Training area, also visible is the Unused Cricket House and the QUB Science Lab.'']]\n[[File:Jenny McDonough.JPG|250px|thumb|''[[Jenny McDonough]] playing for [[Ireland women's national  field hockey team|Ireland]] against [[South Korea women's national  field hockey team|South Korea]] in the [[2008 Women's Hockey Olympic Qualifier]]'']]\n[[File:Quinshockey121.jpg|250px|thumb|''Harlequins Hockey Branding Logo'']]\n\n==Cricket==\n[[Collegians (Belfast)|Collegians]] Cricket Club had merged with Cooke Cricket Club to form [[Cooke Collegians]] in 1998, and so the Belfast Harlequins Cricket Club was effectively a continuation of North. In 2005, however, the cricket section left the Harlequins set-up and now plays at Stormont under the name of [[Civil Service North of Ireland Cricket Club|Civil Service North of Ireland]].\n\n==Hockey==\n\nThe Harlequins hockey sections essentially are that of Collegians as North of Ireland did not have a hockey section since prior to [[World War I]].\n\nIn September 1967, Collegians Men's Hockey Club played and won its first ever competitive fixture, with a 1\u20130 win against Gallaher. In the first season promotion to the Intermediate League was secured with an unbeaten record in the league. This success was carried over to the 1968\u201369 season and the Intermediate League was again won. However, a restructuring of the leagues meant that the 1st XI had to win the League for the second year in succession to receive promotion to [[Ulster Senior League (Men's Hockey)|Senior League Section 2]]. The overall playing record in the first season was played 26, won 22, drawn 1, lost 3. They scored 111 goals and conceded 3.<ref>Ireland's Saturday Night ?/03/1983</ref>\n\nIn their first season in Senior [[Field hockey|hockey]], they were pipped for promotion by one point, remaining unbeaten (Played 18, won 8, drew 10). However, the following year promotion to the top section in the [[Ulster Senior League (Men's Hockey)|Senior League]] was achieved. The team finished level on points with [[Annadale Hockey Club|Annadale]], winning a test match by two goals to one to gain their place in Senior League One.\n\n===Men's section===\n\nThe Harlequins Men's 1st team play in Premier league set up of the [[Ulster Hockey Union|Ulster Branch of the Irish Hockey Union]]. The Men's section currently fields 4 senior teams, an Under 15s team, and a thriving Mini Hockey section for Under 12s.\n\nThe club achieved a place in the top section of the Ulster Senior League as Collegians on two occasions in the 1972\u201373 and 1988\u201389 seasons.\n\nIn the first season at the new artificial turf pitch at Deramore in 2000\u20132001 the Belfast Harlequins Men's Team 1st XI won the Linden Cup.\n\nThe 2007\u20132008 season marked the 40th Anniversary of the founding of the men's hockey section.\n\n====Notable players and administrators====\n\n[[Alan Green (broadcaster)|Alan Green]] of [[BBC]] Radio 5Live fame spent a few seasons on Collegians First XI prior to pursuing his career in England. He was the first player for Collegians ever to be sent off in a competitive fixture. Players such as former Ireland Under-21 goalkeeper Iain Kelly, Cecil Andrews, Philip Duke, Jonathan Furphy, Clifford Marshall, Ivan Kerr, Alan Smith, David Hutchison and Kevin Ryan formed the backbone of Collegians hockey teams over many years. Recently only Michael Patterson has represented Ulster at Under 16 and 18 level, whilst playing at the club.\n\nThe club has had one full Irish International in Ian Kirk-Smith, who gained several full Caps whilst still a Collegian<ref>http://www.collegiansclub.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=223&Itemid=293 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823061233/http://collegiansclub.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=223&Itemid=293 |date=23 August 2014 }} History of Collegians Men's Hockey Club</ref> before moving on to [[Lisnagarvey Hockey Club|Lisnagarvey]]. The Club has also had several players capped at Ulster Junior level.\n\nOn the administrative front Peter Wood served as President of the Ulster Branch of the Irish Hockey Union in 1999.\n\n====Development====\n\nIn 2006 coaching sessions for Under 15 and Under 12 teams recommenced after a ten-year gap. Approximately fifty boys come to Deramore each week for coaching sessions.\n\n===Ladies' section===\n\nHarlequins ladies were promoted from Premier League Ulster Hockey to the EY Irish Hockey League in May 2016.\n\nThe Harlequins Ladies played in Section 1 of the Ulster Women's Hockey Union League. The Women's club is the largest in Ulster fielding 7 teams every Saturday.\n\nIn 2008 the ladies' 1st XI won a place in the 2008/2009 inaugural All Ireland League.\n\nThe ladies' 1st XI has not won a major trophy or competition in its history. The closest was in the [[Ulster Shield]] campaigns of 1945, 1993, 1995, 1999 and 2004 when the 1st XI were beaten Finalists. The Plate competition for first round losers in the Ulster Shield has been won on several occasions.\n\nHome games are played on artificial turf at Deramore Park or The Brook Activity Centre and, for more junior teams, occasionally on shale at Pirrie Park.\n\n====Notable players and Administrators====\n\nBelfast Harlequins that have represented Ireland at full international level include [[Jenny McDonough]] and Suzanne Beaney. Currently Jenna Watt represents Ulster and Ireland at Under-16 Level, Helen Stevenson for Ulster and Irish Under-18 teams. Helen is 1st XI goalkeeper for Harlequins and [[Methodist College Belfast|Methody]]. Laura Wilson has represented Ireland at Under 18 Level, Rebecca Smith at Ulster Under 18 level and Lauren Hackney at Ulster Under 16 level. Former 1st XI Player Katie Larmour has represented Ulster and Ireland at Under 16, 18 and 21 level. Current 1st XI Goalkeeper, Jade Lamont represents Ulster and Ireland at Under 18 Level. Finally, [[Lizzie Colvin]] and [[Zoe Wilson (field hockey)|Zoe Wilson]] were members of the [[Ireland women's national field hockey team|Ireland]] team  that reached the final of the [[2018 Women's Hockey World Cup]] winning silver medals\n\nThe club has provided a number of Ulster administrators such as former Ulster Women's Hockey Union presidents Gerry Gray and Leslie Spence. Coaches include Alison Watt who has managed the Ulster Ladies' Senior Team. At the Under 16 Schoolgirl Internationals, February 2007, Laura Callaghan made her debut as an International Hockey Umpire.\n\n====Development====\n\nYouth hockey is organised by Roisin Walsh, who coaches an Under 14 team that plays in Section 1 of the Under 14s league. The partnership with the school, the 1st XI captain and Methody hockey coach Kelli Thorton, has seen more players coming into the club at all levels.\n\n==Rugby==\n{{see also|Belfast Harlequins Ladies Rugby}}\nThe Rugby club plays in Division 2B of the [[All-Ireland League (rugby union)|All-Ireland League]]. In total, there are 5 senior teams, an under-20 team, an under-18 team, an under-16 team and a ladies' team ([[Belfast harlequins ladies rugby]]), who all play in their respective leagues within the [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster Branch]] of the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]].\n\nThe Belfast Harlequins RFC most successful season was in 2004\u20132005. They finished third in the league table and played at [[Lansdowne Road]] in Dublin in the end of season play-offs. They lost narrowly in the Final to [[Shannon RFC|Shannon]] after a poor defensive display in the first half of the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/4525629.stm|title=BBC 2004\u201305 AIB League Division One Final report|accessdate=14 July 2007 | date=7 May 2005|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> This is closer than a [[North of Ireland FC|North]] or [[Collegians (Belfast)|Collegians]] team had ever come to putting their hands on the Trophy (except for Dungannon RFC and Ballymena RFC who claimed the title in 2000-01 and 2002-03 respectively). The 2006\u201307 season was a season of ups and downs.

This success was carried over to the 1968\u201369 season and the Intermediate League was again won. However, a restructuring of the leagues meant that the 1st XI had to win the League for the second year in succession to receive promotion to [[Ulster Senior League (Men's Hockey)|Senior League Section 2]]. The overall playing record in the first season was played 26, won 22, drawn 1, lost 3. They scored 111 goals and conceded 3.<ref>Ireland's Saturday Night ?/03/1983</ref>\n\nIn their first season in Senior [[Field hockey|hockey]], they were pipped for promotion by one point, remaining unbeaten (Played 18, won 8, drew 10). However, the following year promotion to the top section in the [[Ulster Senior League (Men's Hockey)|Senior League]] was achieved. The team finished level on points with [[Annadale Hockey Club|Annadale]], winning a test match by two goals to one to gain their place in Senior League One.\n\n===Men's section===\n\nThe Harlequins Men's 1st team play in Premier league set up of the [[Ulster Hockey Union|Ulster Branch of the Irish Hockey Union]]. The Men's section currently fields 4 senior teams, an Under 15s team, and a thriving Mini Hockey section for Under 12s.\n\nThe club achieved a place in the top section of the Ulster Senior League as Collegians on two occasions in the 1972\u201373 and 1988\u201389 seasons.\n\nIn the first season at the new artificial turf pitch at Deramore in 2000\u20132001 the Belfast Harlequins Men's Team 1st XI won the Linden Cup.\n\nThe 2007\u20132008 season marked the 40th Anniversary of the founding of the men's hockey section.\n\n====Notable players and administrators====\n\n[[Alan Green (broadcaster)|Alan Green]] of [[BBC]] Radio 5Live fame spent a few seasons on Collegians First XI prior to pursuing his career in England. He was the first player for Collegians ever to be sent off in a competitive fixture. Players such as former Ireland Under-21 goalkeeper Iain Kelly, Cecil Andrews, Philip Duke, Jonathan Furphy, Clifford Marshall, Ivan Kerr, Alan Smith, David Hutchison and Kevin Ryan formed the backbone of Collegians hockey teams over many years. Recently only Michael Patterson has represented Ulster at Under 16 and 18 level, whilst playing at the club.\n\nThe club has had one full Irish International in Ian Kirk-Smith, who gained several full Caps whilst still a Collegian<ref>http://www.collegiansclub.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=223&Itemid=293 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823061233/http://collegiansclub.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=223&Itemid=293 |date=23 August 2014 }} History of Collegians Men's Hockey Club</ref> before moving on to [[Lisnagarvey Hockey Club|Lisnagarvey]]. The Club has also had several players capped at Ulster Junior level.\n\nOn the administrative front Peter Wood served as President of the Ulster Branch of the Irish Hockey Union in 1999.\n\n====Development====\n\nIn 2006 coaching sessions for Under 15 and Under 12 teams recommenced after a ten-year gap. Approximately fifty boys come to Deramore each week for coaching sessions.\n\n===Ladies' section===\n\nHarlequins ladies were promoted from Premier League Ulster Hockey to the EY Irish Hockey League in May 2016.\n\nThe Harlequins Ladies played in Section 1 of the Ulster Women's Hockey Union League. The Women's club is the largest in Ulster fielding 7 teams every Saturday.\n\nIn 2008 the ladies' 1st XI won a place in the 2008/2009 inaugural All Ireland League.\n\nThe ladies' 1st XI has not won a major trophy or competition in its history. The closest was in the [[Ulster Shield]] campaigns of 1945, 1993, 1995, 1999 and 2004 when the 1st XI were beaten Finalists. The Plate competition for first round losers in the Ulster Shield has been won on several occasions.\n\nHome games are played on artificial turf at Deramore Park or The Brook Activity Centre and, for more junior teams, occasionally on shale at Pirrie Park.\n\n====Notable players and Administrators====\n\nBelfast Harlequins that have represented Ireland at full international level include [[Jenny McDonough]] and Suzanne Beaney. Currently Jenna Watt represents Ulster and Ireland at Under-16 Level, Helen Stevenson for Ulster and Irish Under-18 teams. Helen is 1st XI goalkeeper for Harlequins and [[Methodist College Belfast|Methody]]. Laura Wilson has represented Ireland at Under 18 Level, Rebecca Smith at Ulster Under 18 level and Laurren Hackney at Ulster Under 16 level. Former 1st XI Player Katie Larmour has represented Ulster and Ireland at Under 16, 18 and 21 level. Current 1st XI Goalkeeper, Jade Lamont represents Ulster and Ireland at Under 18 Level. Finally, [[Lizzie Colvin]] and [[Zoe Wilson (field hockey)|Zoe Wilson]] were members of the [[Ireland women's national field hockey team|Ireland]] team  that reached the final of the [[2018 Women's Hockey World Cup]] winning silver medals\n\nThe club has provided a number of Ulster administrators such as former Ulster Women's Hockey Union presidents Gerry Gray and Leslie Spence. Coaches include Alison Watt who has managed the Ulster Ladies' Senior Team. At the Under 16 Schoolgirl Internationals, February 2007, Laura Callaghan made her debut as an International Hockey Umpire.\n\n====Development====\n\nYouth hockey is organised by Roisin Walsh, who coaches an Under 14 team that plays in Section 1 of the Under 14s league. The partnership with the school, the 1st XI captain and Methody hockey coach Kelli Thorton, has seen more players coming into the club at all levels.\n\n==Rugby==\n{{see also|Belfast Harlequins Ladies Rugby}}\nThe Rugby club plays in Division 2B of the [[All-Ireland League (rugby union)|All-Ireland League]]. In total, there are 5 senior teams, an under-20 team, an under-18 team, an under-16 team and a ladies' team ([[Belfast harlequins ladies rugby]]), who all play in their respective leagues within the [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster Branch]] of the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]].\n\nThe Belfast Harlequins RFC most successful season was in 2004\u20132005. They finished third in the league table and played at [[Lansdowne Road]] in Dublin in the end of season play-offs. They lost narrowly in the Final to [[Shannon RFC|Shannon]] after a poor defensive display in the first half of the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/4525629.stm|title=BBC 2004\u201305 AIB League Division One Final report|accessdate=14 July 2007 | date=7 May 2005|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> This is closer than a [[North of Ireland FC|North]] or [[Collegians (Belfast)|Collegians]] team had ever come to putting their hands on the Trophy (except for Dungannon RFC and Ballymena RFC who claimed the title in 2000-01 and 2002-03 respectively). The 2006\u201307 season was a season of ups and downs. Despite winning the [[Ulster Senior League (rugby union)|Ulster Senior League]] and reaching the Finals of the [[Ulster Senior Cup]] and the All-Ireland Cup, the club struggled in the [[AIB League|All-Ireland League]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/irish/5211128.stm|title=BBC Ulster Senior League Table 2006-07|accessdate=8 September 2007 | date=24 August 2006|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/irish/6618649.stm|title=BBC 2007 Ulster Senior Cup Final Report|accessdate=4 May 2007 | date=4 May 2007|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> In the last game of the season the club failed to beat [[UCD RFC|UCD]] and were relegated to Division Two.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/irish/6579769.stm|title=BBC report of final game of 2006\u201307 season against UCD|accessdate=14 July 2007 | date=21 April 2007|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/sport/Quins-ask-too-much-of.2704254.jp|title=Belfast Newsletter report on 2006\u201307 AIB Cup Final|accessdate=27 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Honours===\n* [[Ulster Senior Cup (rugby union)|Ulster Senior Cup]]: 3\n** 2000\u201301, 2005\u201306, 2007\u201308\n* [[Ulster Senior League (rugby union)|Ulster Senior League]]: 5 (1 shared)\n** 2002\u201303, 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305 (shared), 2006\u201307, 2007\u201308\n* [[Ulster Junior Cup]]: 1\n** \u20202003\u201304\n\n\u2020 Won by 2nd XV\n\n==Squash==\nIn Squash, Belfast Harlequins have an Irish Junior International in Ben Craig.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The team play in the top section of the Ulster League and have had quite a successful run since the new court at Deramore was opened.\n\n==Achievements==\n* 1998\u20131999\n* 1999\u20132000\n* 2000\u20132001 Men's 1st XI Hockey, Linden Cup Winners. 1st XV [[Ulster Senior Cup]] Winners\n* 2001\u20132002 Winners of [[AIB League|All Ireland Rugby League]] Division 2\n* 2002\u20132003 1st XV [[Ulster Senior League (rugby union)|Ulster Senior League]] Winners, Men's 3rd XI Hockey Junior 5&nbsp;Cup\n* 2003\u20132004 RFC Club of the Year, 1st XV [[Ulster Senior League (rugby union)|Ulster Senior League]] Winners, 2nd XV [[Ulster Junior Cup]] Winners, Winners U20 Roland Barr Competition, Winners of McCrea Cup, YMCA Cup and the Crawford Cup.
