Miami struck back in the second quarter with a 24-yard Dane Prewitt field goal and a 29-yard touchdown pass from [[Gino Torretta]] to [[Coleman Bell]], taking the lead, 10-7.  Florida State countered with a 22-yard field goal by Dan Mowrey, and the teams headed to the locker room deadlocked at 10.\n\nMowrey added a 38-yard field goal in the third quarter and a 41-yarder early in the fourth.  Leading 16-10 with just over 9 minutes to play, the Seminoles found themselves in a position eerily similar to the season before: a 6-point lead late in the game and a field goal kicker who was 3-for-3 on the day.\n\nMiami responded as it did the season before, going on a 7-play, 58-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Torretta to [[Lamar Thomas]].  Torretta was drilled as he released the ball, but Thomas was able to sneak behind [[Clifton Abraham]] and make a basket catch.  With the extra point, Miami seized the lead, 17-16.\n\nMiami's defense held on the next possession, and the Florida State defense forced a punt on Miami's subsequent series.  The ensuing punt proved disastrous for the Seminoles: punt returner [[Corey Sawyer]] was penalized for attempting an illegal forward pass from his own end zone, resulting in a [[safety (American football score)|safety]] for Miami.  With Miami now leading 19-16, a field goal could only tie the game for the Seminoles.  The Miami defense again held, but Florida State then forced the 'Canes to punt, giving the Seminoles one last chance with 1:35 left.\n\nQuarterback [[Charlie Ward]] drove the Seminoles 59 yards and into field goal range, converting a crucial fourth-and-12 with a completion to [[Kez McCorvey]] along the way.  The drive was highlighted by Matt Frier's diving, fingertip reception for 17 yards.  After Ward picked up 19 yards on two quick scrambles, the Seminoles were on the Miami 22-yard line but nearly out of time.  On the game's final play, Florida State called upon Mowrey to make a 39-yard field goal and tie the game at 19. With both Miami's and Florida State's [[NCAA Division I-A National Football Championship|national championship]] hopes again hanging in the balance, Mowrey, kicking into the open end of the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]], missed wide right and collapsed face down onto the turf.\n\n==Aftermath==\nMiami once again used a hard-fought win over its rival as a springboard for a national championship run, winning its final seven regular season games and earning a berth in the [[1993 Sugar Bowl]] as the nation's number one team in both the [[AP Poll#College football|AP]] and [[Coaches' Poll#College football|Coaches']] Polls. This time, however, the Hurricanes could not complete the perfect season, losing to the second-ranked and eventual national champion [[1992 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]] in the Sugar Bowl 34-13, and finishing 11-1 and ranked third in the country.\n\nUnlike the previous season, when the Seminoles followed up their loss to Miami with an upset loss to [[1991 Florida Gators football team|Florida]], Florida State rebounded and won the rest of its games, going 11-1 on the season.  The Seminoles soundly defeated the [[1992 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] in the [[1993 Orange Bowl]], 27-14, and, despite the loss to Miami, were ranked second in the final polls, one spot ahead of the Hurricanes.\n\nThe game was the second in a peculiar string of 5 games in 12 years in which Florida State lost to Miami due to a late missed field goal that would have won or tied the game for the Seminoles, often with national championship implications.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Florida State Seminoles football navbox}}\n{{Miami Hurricanes football navbox}}\n{{College Football on ABC}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wide Right II}}\n[[Category:American football incidents]]\n[[Category:1992 Atlantic Coast Conference football season]]\n[[Category:1992 Big East Conference football season]]\n[[Category:Florida State Seminoles football games]]\n[[Category:Miami Hurricanes football games]]\n[[Category:1992 in sports in Florida]]\n[[Category:1990s in Miami]]\n[[Category:October 1992 sports events in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox NCAA football single game\n|Name=Wide Right II\n|Year=1992\n|Type=nc\n|Image=\n|Date=October 3, [[1992 NCAA Division I-A football season|1992]]\n|Stadium=[[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]\n|City=[[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]]\n|Visitor Name Short=Florida State\n|Visitor Nickname=Seminoles\n|Home Name Short=Miami\n|Home Nickname=Hurricanes\n|Visitor Record=4\u20130\n|Home Record=3\u20130\n|Visitor Coach=[[Bobby Bowden]]\n|Home Coach=[[Dennis Erickson]]\n|Visitor1=7\n|Visitor2=3\n|Visitor3=3\n|Visitor4=3\n|Home1=0\n|Home2=10\n|Home3=0\n|Home4=9\n|Visitor AP=3\n|Visitor Coaches=3\n|Home AP=2\n|Home Coaches=2\n|MVP=\n|Odds=\n|Anthem=\n|Referee=Joe Rider\n|Halftime=\n|Attendance=77,338\n|US Network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|US Announcers=[[Keith Jackson]] and [[Bob Griese]]\n|Ratings=\n|Intl Network=\n|Intl Announcers=\n}}\n\n'''Wide Right II''' is a colloquial name for the [[1992 NCAA Division I-A football season|1992 college football]] game between the [[1992 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami Hurricanes]] and [[1992 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State Seminoles]].

His father, Dov Ber Malkin, was a professor and theatre critic. He attended the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Bund]] school. He moved to [[Mandatory Palestine]] at age 7, where he continued his schooling in the  school system of the [[Histadrut]] labor federation.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.698653]</ref> In 1950 he married the artist [[Felice Pazner Malkin]] and they had two children, Professor Irad Malkin (2004 Israel Prize Laureate) and Rabbi [[Sivan Malkin Maas]]. He died two weeks before his 93rd birthday in his Jerusalem home.\n\n==Academic, literary and diplomatic career==\nStarting in 1944, while still a student, Malkin published literary, cinema, and theater critiques, and served as the editor of ''[[On the Wall (magazine)|On the Wall]]'', the magazine of the [[Hashomer Hatzair]] youth movement (1944\u20131946). During the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], he served as a broadcasting officer for the [[Haganah]] and the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] (1947\u20131948) in the [[underground radio]] station, ''Telem Shamir Boaz'', that later became the [[Army Radio (Israel)|Israel Army Radio]] (''Galei Tzahal''). Malkin lectured (in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]) and was active in the [[Cyprus internment camps]] before the inmates were sent to Israel, and worked for the IDF arms procurement branch in France 1949. He directed and lectured in [[Pomansky College for Judaism as Culture]] in New York in 1951, and founded and directed a Hebrew [[Ulpan]] (language school) in the [[Quartier Latin]] in [[Paris]] in 1956. While in Paris, he also worked as assistant to the [[cultural attach\u00e9]] at the Israeli embassy in Paris. He also participated in a lecture tour on Judaism in world literature in Australia (1960), the United States (1965), and France (1970).\n\nFrom 1952 to 1956, Malkin taught [[comparative literature]] studies and the Bible as literature at the [[Seminar HaKibbutzim]] teachers' college in [[Tel Aviv]]. At the same time he served as director of the repertoire department at the [[Habima]] national theater and as a drama instructor at the theater schools of Habima and of the [[Cameri Theater]].\n\nFrom 1971 to 1981, he founded and directed the Mateh Yehuda community college, which employed the educational methods of [[Empire State College]] (SUNY) where students create personal tracks of study. This was adopted to conditions in Israel and to the particular requirements of working students in the Mateh Yehuda area.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1994, Malkin taught aesthetics, theater and film criticism at the [[Tel Aviv University]]. In 1971 he established, together with the Dean of the Faculty for New Arts, Professor [[Moshe Lazar]], the Department for Cinema and Television at the Tel Aviv University. He also served as the university's representative in the founding team of the [[Tel Aviv Cinematheque]], and as editor of the \"Cinematheque Pages\" \u2013 film criticism essays handed out to viewers before the screening of each movie, together with [[Uri Klein]].\n\nFrom 1958 to 1971, Malkin founded and directed the first community centers in [[Haifa]], [[Beit Rothschild]] and the [[Beit Hagefen Jewish\u2013Arab Center]]. These municipal centers were at first run by groups of friends who led the centers' dozens of social activities, including the [[Haifa Cinematheque]], built inside Beit Rothschild. During these years Malkin also lectured in the [[Technion]] (Israel Institute of Technology) on aesthetics and rhetoric.\n\nToday Malkin serves as editor-in-chief for [[Free Judaism]], a magazine for Judaism as a culture, which he founded in 1995 and which came out in print editions until 2004. Malkin also serves as provost at the [[International Institute for Humanistic Secular Judaism]], based in [[Jerusalem]] ([[Tmura]]) and in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan|Farmington Hills]] near Detroit in the United States (\"Birmingham Temple\"). The institute trains students who hold an undergraduate degree to be community leaders for secular communities and those with a master's degree or a PhD to be secular Rabbis in a four-year track of studies and work.\n\n==Writings==\nYaakov Malkin's writings focus on humanistic ethics and the preservation of Jewish culture in a social context where literalist interpretations on the existence of God fade with each generation. Malkin, and many others, argue that to be a Jew is fundamentally a cultural identity, and not a religious one, and he often jokes that he was a descendant of many generations of devout Jews, and then goes on to list several generations of ancestors who were atheists. He further argues that whereas religiosity has been an essential part of Jewish identity, the actual belief in a god was always a matter of friction, and whether individual Jews publicly admitted it or not, he claims most Jews have always understood god as an allegory and seen Judaism as a tradition of cultural - rather than religious - significance. Given this reality, Malkin argues that an honest reflection of one's own Jewish beliefs will demonstrate to oneself that they are already a humanistic or secular Jew.\n\nMalkin perceives [[Judaism]] as a [[Religious pluralism|pluralistic]] culture, both in its secular and its religious forms. He claims that Judaism has been pluralistic since the biblical era when the culture of the [[Jewish people]] was characterized by belief in many gods, religions, rituals, beliefs, and opinions. Beginning in [[Hellenistic]] times Judaism developed a variety of cultures, beliefs, and opinions.\n\nUnlike atheist scholars such as [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], who see [[atheism]] as the lack of belief, Malkin dedicates his writings to the humanistic beliefs shared by the non-religious community in the West generally, and among the Jewish people in particular. Malkin claims that there are no nonbelievers, but rather people who express a variety of beliefs in their day-to-day lives. These can include religious beliefs, characterized by a commitment to follow religious leaders who claim to speak in the name of a god, or nonreligious beliefs, which include the belief in humans as creators of their own paths and behaviors, whether as individuals or in society, with the goal of attaining the purpose of human life: happiness.\n\nIn his books ''What do Secular Jews Believe?'', ''Secular Judaism: Faith, Values, and Spirituality'', and ''The Atheist Belief of Secular Jews'', Malkin expresses his views of the humanistic belief in people that leads to national awareness and belief in the rights of all people and all nations. These beliefs lead to a rebuttal of \"godly religions\" that obligate the believer to keep the rules of their leaders, especially those that stand in contrast to the values of [[humanism]] and [[universal justice]]. These anti-humanistic beliefs lead, among other things, to the acceptance of secular ideological religions such as Communism and [[Nazism]] wherein believers are also obligated to obey leaders, regardless of the cost.\n\nHumanistic nonreligious beliefs include Agnostics such as [[Socrates]], [[Deist]]s such as [[Epicurus]], [[Pantheist]]s such as [[Spinoza]] or [[Einstein]], and Atheists such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], which are all free of commitment to a religious or ideological religion. A contemporary institutionalized Jewish form of humanism is Humanistic Judaism<!-- (www.shj.org)-->, to which Malkin's works contributed and in which movement Malkin's daughter, Sivan Maas, is a rabbi. These humanistic nonreligious beliefs stand in contrast to postmodern [[relativism]] in that they see themselves as bound by humanistic ethical values and by the values of universal justice as articulated by [[Confucius]] and [[Hillel the Elder]]: \"Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself\".  These values of justice lead to the moral values of [[egalitarianism|equality]], [[political freedom|freedom]], and [[Human rights|human]] and national rights.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.yaakovmalkin.com Official Site]\n* [http://www.free-judaism.org/76682/free-judaism-english-articles/ Free Judaism's English Articles]\n* [http://www.tmuraisrael.org.il/site/index.asp?depart_id=53609&lat=en/ Tmura: The International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism]\n* [http://www.iishj.org/ The International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism]\n* [http://www.culturaljudaism.org/ccj/news/19 The Center for Cultural Judaism]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malkin, Yaakov}}\n[[Category:1926 births]]\n[[Category:2019 deaths]]\n[[Category:Humanistic Jews]]\n[[Category:Jewish atheists]]\n[[Category:Israeli atheists]]\n[[Category:Israeli Jews]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\n'''Yaakov Malkin''' (3 August 1926 \u2013 21 July 2019) was an intellectual, educator,<ref name=twsDecZb26>{{cite news|author= Yair Sheleg|title= The secular Jewish canon|publisher= Haaretz.com|quote= \"There are places, like Professor Yaakov Malkin's group, where articles by Malkin [the editor of the journal Free Judaism], ...|date= 29 September 2006|url= http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/the-secular-jewish-canon-1.198167|accessdate= 28 December 2010\n}}</ref> writer, [[literary critic]], and [[professor emeritus]] in the Faculty of Arts at [[Tel Aviv University]].<ref name=\"CCJ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culturaljudaism.org/ccj/news/19|title=Author, Lecturer, and Professor Yaakov Malkin Receives Jerusalem Film Festival Life Achievement Award|publisher=Center for Cultural Judaism|accessdate=9 April 2011}}</ref> Malkin was active in several cultural and educational institutions that deal with [[Cultural Judaism|cultural]] and [[humanistic Judaism]].\n\n==Biography==\nMalkin was born in [[Warsaw]], Poland, to a secular Jewish family.

Malkin lectured (in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]) and was active in the [[Cyprus internment camps]] before the inmates were sent to Israel, and worked for the IDF arms procurement branch in France 1949. He directed and lectured in [[Pomansky College for Judaism as Culture]] in New York in 1951, and founded and directed a Hebrew [[Ulpan]] (language school) in the [[Quartier Latin]] in [[Paris]] in 1956. While in Paris, he also worked as assistant to the [[cultural attach\u00e9]] at the Israeli embassy in Paris. He also participated in a lecture tour on Judaism in world literature in Australia (1960), the United States (1965), and France (1970).\n\nFrom 1952 to 1956, Malkin taught [[comparative literature]] studies and the Bible as literature at the [[Seminar HaKibbutzim]] teachers' college in [[Tel Aviv]]. At the same time he served as director of the repertoire department at the [[Habima]] national theater and as a drama instructor at the theater schools of Habima and of the [[Cameri Theater]].\n\nFrom 1971 to 1981, he founded and directed the Mateh Yehuda community college, which employed the educational methods of [[Empire State College]] (SUNY) where students create personal tracks of study. This was adopted to conditions in Israel and to the particular requirements of working students in the Mateh Yehuda area.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1994, Malkin taught aesthetics, theater and film criticism at the [[Tel Aviv University]]. In 1971 he established, together with the Dean of the Faculty for New Arts, Professor [[Moshe Lazar]], the Department for Cinema and Television at the Tel Aviv University. He also served as the university's representative in the founding team of the [[Tel Aviv Cinematheque]], and as editor of the \"Cinematheque Pages\" \u2013 film criticism essays handed out to viewers before the screening of each movie, together with [[Uri Klein]].\n\nFrom 1958 to 1971, Malkin founded and directed the first community centers in [[Haifa]], [[Beit Rothschild]] and the [[Beit Hagefen Jewish\u2013Arab Center]]. These municipal centers were at first run by groups of friends who led the centers' dozens of social activities, including the [[Haifa Cinematheque]], built inside Beit Rothschild. During these years Malkin also lectured in the [[Technion]] (Israel Institute of Technology) on aesthetics and rhetoric.\n\nToday Malkin serves as editor-in-chief for [[Free Judaism]], a magazine for Judaism as a culture, which he founded in 1995 and which came out in print editions until 2004. Malkin also serves as provost at the [[International Institute for Humanistic Secular Judaism]], based in [[Jerusalem]] ([[Tmura]]) and in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan|Farmington Hills]] near Detroit in the United States (\"Birmingham Temple\"). The institute trains students who hold an undergraduate degree to be community leaders for secular communities and those with a master's degree or a PhD to be secular Rabbis in a four-year track of studies and work.\n\n==Writings==\nYaakov Malkin's writings focus on humanistic ethics and the preservation of Jewish culture in a social context where literalist interpretations on the existence of God fade with each generation. Malkin, and many others, argue that to be a Jew is fundamentally a cultural identity, and not a religious one, and he often jokes that he was a descendant of many generations of devout Jews, and then goes on to list several generations of ancestors who were atheists. He further argues that whereas religiosity has been an essential part of Jewish identity, the actual belief in a god was always a matter of friction, and whether individual Jews publicly admitted it or not, he claims most Jews have always understood god as an allegory and seen Judaism as a tradition of cultural - rather than religious - significance. Given this reality, Malkin argues that an honest reflection of one's own Jewish beliefs will demonstrate to oneself that they are already a humanistic or secular Jew.\n\nMalkin perceives [[Judaism]] as a [[Religious pluralism|pluralistic]] culture, both in its secular and its religious forms. He claims that Judaism has been pluralistic since the biblical era when the culture of the [[Jewish people]] was characterized by belief in many gods, religions, rituals, beliefs, and opinions. Beginning in [[Hellenistic]] times Judaism developed a variety of cultures, beliefs, and opinions.\n\nUnlike atheist scholars such as [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], who see [[atheism]] as the lack of belief, Malkin dedicates his writings to the humanistic beliefs shared by the non-religious community in the West generally, and among the Jewish people in particular. Malkin claims that there are no nonbelievers, but rather people who express a variety of beliefs in their day-to-day lives. These can include religious beliefs, characterized by a commitment to follow religious leaders who claim to speak in the name of a god, or nonreligious beliefs, which include the belief in humans as creators of their own paths and behaviors, whether as individuals or in society, with the goal of attaining the purpose of human life: happiness.\n\nIn his books ''What do Secular Jews Believe?'', ''Secular Judaism: Faith, Values, and Spirituality'', and ''The Atheist Belief of Secular Jews'', Malkin expresses his views of the humanistic belief in people that leads to national awareness and belief in the rights of all people and all nations. These beliefs lead to a rebuttal of \"godly religions\" that obligate the believer to keep the rules of their leaders, especially those that stand in contrast to the values of [[humanism]] and [[universal justice]]. These anti-humanistic beliefs lead, among other things, to the acceptance of secular ideological religions such as Communism and [[Nazism]] wherein believers are also obligated to obey leaders, regardless of the cost.\n\nHumanistic nonreligious beliefs include Agnostics such as [[Socrates]], [[Deist]]s such as [[Epicurus]], [[Pantheist]]s such as [[Spinoza]] or [[Einstein]], and Atheists such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], which are all free of commitment to a religious or ideological religion. A contemporary institutionalized Jewish form of humanism is Humanistic Judaism<!-- (www.shj.org)-->, to which Malkin's works contributed and in which movement Malkin's daughter, Sivan Maas, is a rabbi. These humanistic nonreligious beliefs stand in contrast to postmodern [[relativism]] in that they see themselves as bound by humanistic ethical values and by the values of universal justice as articulated by [[Confucius]] and [[Hillel the Elder]]: \"Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself\".  These values of justice lead to the moral values of [[egalitarianism|equality]], [[political freedom|freedom]], and [[Human rights|human]] and national rights.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.yaakovmalkin.com Official Site]\n* [http://www.free-judaism.org/76682/free-judaism-english-articles/ Free Judaism's English Articles]\n* [http://www.tmuraisrael.org.il/site/index.asp?depart_id=53609&lat=en/ Tmura: The International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism]\n* [http://www.iishj.org/ The International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism]\n* [http://www.culturaljudaism.org/ccj/news/19 The Center for Cultural Judaism]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malkin, Yaakov}}\n[[Category:1926 births]]\n[[Category:2019 deaths]]\n[[Category:Humanistic Jews]]\n[[Category:Jewish atheists]]\n[[Category:Israeli atheists]]\n[[Category:Israeli Jews]]\n", "name_user": "Lovemankind83", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Malkin"}

He has been living in [[Nea Smyrni]] since 2005. He studied law and modern Greek philology at the University of Athens and worked as a professor of philology in secondary education from 1980 to 2010.\n\nHe was the co-founder of the literary journals ''To Dentro'' (1978), ''Nisos \u2013 Music and Poetry'' (1983) and ''Critique and Texts'' (1984). Since 1986 he has published the literary journal ''[[Planodion]]'', while in April 2010 he created and has since run a website for short stories called Bonsai Stories.\n\nIn 1995 he edited, with the collaboration of Elissavet Liaropoulou, the philological edition in two volumes of Angelos Simiriotis' poems (1870\u20131944). Simirioti was a poet from Smyrna in Asia Minor.\n\nIn 1996, he was a guest at the Hellenic Studies Program of the University of Princeton and in 2000 a guest poet at the 31st International Poetry Festival in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. His poems have been translated into many languages and have been included in many anthologies and magazines in Greece and abroad.

These systems are typically configured by [[systems integrator]]s, who bring unique knowledge on process, equipment, and vendor solutions.\n\n'''Direct integration'''\u2014ERP systems have connectivity (communications to plant floor equipment) as part of their product offering. This requires that the vendors offer specific support for the plant floor equipment their customers operate. ERP vendors must be experts in their own products and connectivity to other vendor products, including those of their competitors.\n\n'''Database integration'''\u2014ERP systems connect to plant floor data sources through staging tables in a database. Plant floor systems deposit the necessary information into the database. The ERP system reads the information in the table. The benefit of staging is that ERP vendors do not need to master the complexities of equipment integration. Connectivity becomes the responsibility of the systems integrator.\n\n'''[[Enterprise appliance transaction module]]s (EATM)'''\u2014These devices communicate directly with plant floor equipment and with the ERP system via methods supported by the ERP system. EATM can employ a staging table, web services, or system\u2013specific program interfaces ([[Api|APIs]]). An EATM offers the benefit of being an off\u2013the\u2013shelf solution.\n\n'''Custom\u2013integration solutions'''\u2014Many system integrators offer custom solutions. These systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost, and can have a higher long term maintenance and reliability costs. Long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation. Custom\u2013integrated solutions typically run on [[workstation]] or server-class computers.\n\n==Implementation==\nERP's scope usually implies significant changes to staff work processes and practices.<ref name=\"tech-faq.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tech-faq.com/erp.shtml |title=ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) |publisher=Tech-faq.com |date=March 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}</ref> Generally, three types of services are available to help implement such changes\u2014consulting, customization, and support.<ref name=\"tech-faq.com\" /> Implementation time depends on business size, number of modules, customization, the scope of process changes, and the readiness of the customer to take ownership for the project.

Analysis can identify opportunities for process modernization. It also enables an assessment of the alignment of current processes with those provided by the ERP system. Research indicates that risk of business process mismatch is decreased by:\n* Linking current processes to the organization's strategy\n* Analyzing the effectiveness of each process\n* Understanding existing automated solutions<ref>King.

ERP systems typically include many settings that modify system operations. For example, an organization can select the type of inventory accounting\u2014[[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO or LIFO]]\u2014to use; whether to recognize revenue by geographical unit, product line, or distribution channel; and whether to pay for shipping costs on customer returns.<ref name=\"Thomas H. Davenport 1998\"/>\n\n===Two-tier enterprise resource planning===\n\nTwo-tier ERP software and hardware lets companies run the equivalent of two ERP systems at once: one at the corporate level and one at the division or subsidiary level. For example, a manufacturing company could use an ERP system to manage across the organization using independent global or regional distribution, production or sales centers, and service providers to support the main company's customers. Each independent center (or) subsidiary may have its own [[business model]]s, [[workflow]]s, and [[business process]]es.\n\nGiven the realities of globalization, enterprises continuously evaluate how to optimize their regional, divisional, and product or manufacturing strategies to support strategic goals and reduce time-to-market while increasing profitability and delivering value.<ref name=\"ferdows\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ferdows | first1 = K | year = 1997 | title = Making the most of foreign factories | url = | journal = [[Harvard Business Review]] | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 73\u201388 }}</ref> With two-tier ERP, the regional distribution, production, or sales centers and service providers continue operating under their own business model\u2014separate from the main company, using their own ERP systems.

The effect of customization is less predictable. It is the customer's responsibility, and increases testing activities.\n* Configuration changes survive upgrades to new software versions. Some customizations (e.g., code that uses pre\u2013defined \"hooks\" that are called before/after displaying data screens) survive upgrades, though they require retesting.

Data takes many forms in the modern enterprise, including documents, files, forms, audio and video, and [[email]]s. Often, each data medium has its own mechanism for allowing collaboration.

This concept is similar to the so-called best-of-breed approach<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3171517/postmodern-erp-strategy-bestofbreed-approach|title=Postmodern ERP Strategy Is Not a Best-of-Breed Approach|publisher=Gartner Group|access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref> to software execution, but it shouldn't be confused with it. While in both cases, applications that make up the whole are relatively loosely connected and quite easily interchangeable, in the case of the latter there is no ERP solution whatsoever. Instead, every business function is covered by a separate software solution.\n\nThere is, however, no golden rule as to what business functions should be part of the core ERP, and what should be covered by supplementary solutions. According to Gartner, every company must define their own postmodern ERP strategy, based on company's internal and external needs, operations and processes. For example, a company may define that the core ERP solution should cover those business processes that must stay behind the firewall, and therefore, choose to leave their core ERP [[On-premises software|on-premises]]. At the same time, another company may decide to host the core ERP solution in the cloud and move only a few ERP modules as supplementary solutions to on-premises.\n\nThe main benefits that companies will gain from implementing postmodern ERP strategy are speed and flexibility when reacting to unexpected changes in business processes or on the organizational level.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://enterprise-resource-planning.cioreview.com/cxoinsight/5-factors-facilitating-the-transition-to-the-postmodern-erp-era-nid-7292-cid-96.html|title=5 Factors Facilitating the Transition to the Postmodern ERP Era|newspaper=CIOReview|access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref> With the majority of applications having a relatively loose connection, it is fairly easy to replace or upgrade them whenever necessary. In addition to that, following the examples above, companies can select and combine cloud-based and on-premises solutions that are most suited for their ERP needs. The downside of postmodern ERP is that it will most likely lead to an increased number of software vendors that companies will have to manage, as well as pose additional [[Application Integration Architecture|integration]] challenges for the central IT.\n\n== Corporate Operating System ==\nSome companies realized that using off-the-shelf ERP solutions like SAP instead of custom-built ERP can slow down their pace of innovation and limit implementation of larger business process optimizations (an example would be direct factory to consumer distribution model, without using warehouses).<ref>https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/5/2044/htm</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[List of ERP software packages]]\n* [[Accounting software]]\n* [[Bill of resources]]\n* [[Business process management]]\n* [[Business intelligence]]\n* [[Cost accounting]]\n* [[Cybernetics]]\n* [[Document automation]]\n* [[Data migration]]\n* [[Economic planning]]\n* [[Enterprise feedback management]] (EFM)\n* [[Enterprise planning systems]]\n* [[Enterprise system]]\n* [[ERP modeling]]\n* [[ERP system selection methodology]]\n* [[Information technology management]]\n* [[List of project management software]]\n* [[Management information system]]\n* [[Manufacturing operations management]]\n* [[Material balance planning]]\n* [[Operations research]]\n* [[Service management]]\n* [[Software as a service]]\n* [[Visitor management|Visitor management systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite journal|last=Clemons|first=Eric.

These systems are typically configured by [[systems integrator]]s, who bring unique knowledge on process, equipment, and vendor solutions.\n\n'''Direct integration'''\u2014ERP systems have connectivity (communications to plant floor equipment) as part of their product offering. This requires that the vendors offer specific support for the plant floor equipment their customers operate. ERP vendors must be experts in their own products and connectivity to other vendor products, including those of their competitors.\n\n'''Database integration'''\u2014ERP systems connect to plant floor data sources through staging tables in a database. Plant floor systems deposit the necessary information into the database. The ERP system reads the information in the table. The benefit of staging is that ERP vendors do not need to master the complexities of equipment integration. Connectivity becomes the responsibility of the systems integrator.\n\n'''[[Enterprise appliance transaction module]]s (EATM)'''\u2014These devices communicate directly with plant floor equipment and with the ERP system via methods supported by the ERP system. EATM can employ a staging table, web services, or system\u2013specific program interfaces ([[Api|APIs]]). An EATM offers the benefit of being an off\u2013the\u2013shelf solution.\n\n'''Custom\u2013integration solutions'''\u2014Many system integrators offer custom solutions. These systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost, and can have a higher long term maintenance and reliability costs. Long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation. Custom\u2013integrated solutions typically run on [[workstation]] or server-class computers.\n\n==Implementation==\nERP's scope usually implies significant changes to staff work processes and practices.<ref name=\"tech-faq.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tech-faq.com/erp.shtml |title=ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) |publisher=Tech-faq.com |date=March 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}</ref> Generally, three types of services are available to help implement such changes\u2014consulting, customization, and support.<ref name=\"tech-faq.com\" /> Implementation time depends on business size, number of modules, customization, the scope of process changes, and the readiness of the customer to take ownership for the project.

Analysis can identify opportunities for process modernization. It also enables an assessment of the alignment of current processes with those provided by the ERP system. Research indicates that risk of business process mismatch is decreased by:\n* Linking current processes to the organization's strategy\n* Analyzing the effectiveness of each process\n* Understanding existing automated solutions<ref>King.

Davenport, \"Putting the Enterprise into the Enterprise System\", ''Harvard Business Review'', July\u2013August 1998.</ref>\n\nA potential disadvantage is that adopting \"standard\" processes can lead to a loss of [[competitive advantage]]. While this has happened, losses in one area are often offset by gains in other areas, increasing overall competitive advantage.<ref>Turban et al. (2008).

ERP systems typically include many settings that modify system operations. For example, an organization can select the type of inventory accounting\u2014[[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO or LIFO]]\u2014to use; whether to recognize revenue by geographical unit, product line, or distribution channel; and whether to pay for shipping costs on customer returns.<ref name=\"Thomas H. Davenport 1998\"/>\n\n===Two-tier enterprise resource planning===\n\nTwo-tier ERP software and hardware lets companies run the equivalent of two ERP systems at once: one at the corporate level and one at the division or subsidiary level. For example, a manufacturing company could use an ERP system to manage across the organization using independent global or regional distribution, production or sales centers, and service providers to support the main company's customers. Each independent center (or) subsidiary may have its own [[business model]]s, [[workflow]]s, and [[business process]]es.\n\nGiven the realities of globalization, enterprises continuously evaluate how to optimize their regional, divisional, and product or manufacturing strategies to support strategic goals and reduce time-to-market while increasing profitability and delivering value.<ref name=\"ferdows\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ferdows | first1 = K | year = 1997 | title = Making the most of foreign factories | url = | journal = [[Harvard Business Review]] | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 73\u201388 }}</ref> With two-tier ERP, the regional distribution, production, or sales centers and service providers continue operating under their own business model\u2014separate from the main company, using their own ERP systems. Since these smaller companies' processes and workflows are not tied to main company's processes and workflows, they can respond to local business requirements in multiple locations.<ref name=\"gill\">Gill, R.

Key differences between customization and configuration include:\n\n* Customization is always optional, whereas the software must always be configured before use (e.g., setting up cost/profit center structures, organizational trees, purchase approval rules, etc.).\n* The software is designed to handle various configurations and behaves predictably in any allowed configuration.\n* The effect of configuration changes on system behavior and performance is predictable and is the responsibility of the ERP vendor. The effect of customization is less predictable. It is the customer's responsibility, and increases testing activities.\n* Configuration changes survive upgrades to new software versions. Some customizations (e.g., code that uses pre\u2013defined \"hooks\" that are called before/after displaying data screens) survive upgrades, though they require retesting.

This concept is similar to the so-called best-of-breed approach<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3171517/postmodern-erp-strategy-bestofbreed-approach|title=Postmodern ERP Strategy Is Not a Best-of-Breed Approach|publisher=Gartner Group|access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref> to software execution, but it shouldn't be confused with it. While in both cases, applications that make up the whole are relatively loosely connected and quite easily interchangeable, in the case of the latter there is no ERP solution whatsoever. Instead, every business function is covered by a separate software solution.\n\nThere is, however, no golden rule as to what business functions should be part of the core ERP, and what should be covered by supplementary solutions. According to Gartner, every company must define their own postmodern ERP strategy, based on company's internal and external needs, operations and processes. For example, a company may define that the core ERP solution should cover those business processes that must stay behind the firewall, and therefore, choose to leave their core ERP [[On-premises software|on-premises]]. At the same time, another company may decide to host the core ERP solution in the cloud and move only a few ERP modules as supplementary solutions to on-premises.\n\nThe main benefits that companies will gain from implementing postmodern ERP strategy are speed and flexibility when reacting to unexpected changes in business processes or on the organizational level.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://enterprise-resource-planning.cioreview.com/cxoinsight/5-factors-facilitating-the-transition-to-the-postmodern-erp-era-nid-7292-cid-96.html|title=5 Factors Facilitating the Transition to the Postmodern ERP Era|newspaper=CIOReview|access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref> With the majority of applications having a relatively loose connection, it is fairly easy to replace or upgrade them whenever necessary. In addition to that, following the examples above, companies can select and combine cloud-based and on-premises solutions that are most suited for their ERP needs. The downside of postmodern ERP is that it will most likely lead to an increased number of software vendors that companies will have to manage, as well as pose additional [[Application Integration Architecture|integration]] challenges for the central IT.\n\n== Corporate Operating System ==\nSome companies realized that using off-the-shelf ERP solutions like SAP instead of custom-built ERP can slow down their pace of innovation and limit implementation of larger business process optimizations (an example would be direct factory to consumer distribution model, without using warehouses).<ref>https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/5/2044/htm</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[List of ERP software packages]]\n* [[Accounting software]]\n* [[Bill of resources]]\n* [[Business process management]]\n* [[Business intelligence]]\n* [[Cost accounting]]\n* [[Cybernetics]]\n* [[Document automation]]\n* [[Data migration]]\n* [[Economic planning]]\n* [[Enterprise feedback management]] (EFM)\n* [[Enterprise planning systems]]\n* [[Enterprise system]]\n* [[ERP modeling]]\n* [[ERP system selection methodology]]\n* [[Information technology management]]\n* [[List of project management software]]\n* [[Management information system]]\n* [[Manufacturing operations management]]\n* [[Material balance planning]]\n* [[Operations research]]\n* [[Service management]]\n* [[Software as a service]]\n* [[Visitor management|Visitor management systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite journal|last=Clemons|first=Eric.
