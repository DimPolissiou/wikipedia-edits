Though Alvey survived to go to a decision, Rivera was victorious via majority decision (19-19, 20-18, 20-18).\n\n===Maximum Fighting Championship===\nAlvey's MFC debut was against Elvis Mutapcic for the MFC Middleweight Championship at MFC 36, He lost via unanimous decision.

Due to the fact that the [[vapor pressure]] of [[carbon]] is negligible compared to the one of [[silicon]], the Si atoms desorb at high temperatures and leave behind the carbon atoms which form graphitic layers, also called few-layer graphene (FLG). Different heating mechanisms like [[Electron-beam technology#Surface treatments|e-beam heating]] or [[Joule heating|resistive heating]] lead to the same result. The heating process takes place in vacuum to avoid contaminations. Approximately three bilayers of SiC are necessary to set free enough carbon atoms needed for the formation of one graphene layer. This number can be calculated out of the molar densities.<ref name=\"Yu11\">{{cite journal|title=New Synthesis Method for the Growth of Epitaxial Graphene|year=2011|journal=Journal of Electron Spectroscopy and Related Phenomena|volume=184|pages=100\u2013106|issue=3\u20136|last1=Yu|first1=X.

The FLG obtained so far has a non-uniform thickness distribution which leads to different electronic properties. Because of this, there's a demand for growing uniform large-area FLG with the desired thickness in a reproducible way. Also, the impact of the SiC substrate on the physical properties of FLG is not totally understood yet.<ref name=\"Hib10\"/>\n\nThe thermal decomposition process of SiC in high / ultra high vacuum works out well and appears promising for large scale production of devices on graphene basis. But still, there are some problems that have to be solved. Using this technique, the resulting graphene consists of small grains with varying thickness (30&nbsp;nm-200&nbsp;nm). These grains occur due to morphological changes of the SiC surface under high temperatures.

This number can be determined by using the quantized oscillations of the electron reflectivity. Electrons have a wave character. If they are shot on the graphene surface, they can be reflected either from the graphene surface or from the graphene-SiC interface. The reflected electrons (waves) can interfere with each other. The electron reflectivity itself changes periodically as a function of the incident electron energy and the FLG thickness. For example, thinner FLG provides longer oscillation periods. The most suitable technique for these measurements is the [[low-energy electron microscopy]] (LEEM).<ref name=\"Hib10\"/>\n\nInspection with an optical microscope allows surprisingly simple and accurate identification of single and multilayer graphene domains in epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide (SiC/G) and is informative about nanoscopic details of the SiC topography, making it ideal for rapid and noninvasive quality control of as-grown SiC/G.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yager |first1=T. |last2=Lartsev |first2=A. |last3=Mahashabde |first3=S. |last4=Charpentier |first4=S. |last5=Davidovikj |first5=D. |last6=Danilov |first6=A. |last7=Yakimova |first7=R. |last8=Panchal |first8=V. |last9=Kazakova |first9=O. |last10=Tzalenchuk |first10=A |last11=Lara-Avila |first11=S. |last12=Kubatkin |first12=S. |title=Express Optical Analysis of Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: Impact of Morphology on Quantum Transport |journal=NanoLetters |volume=13 |issue=9 |doi=10.1021/nl402347g}}</ref> Best results are obtained in combination with non-linear contrast enhancement ([[gamma correction]]), allowing for real time quality control of the as-grown materials and micro devices.\n\n==Applications==\nFurthermore, epitaxial graphene on SiC is considered as a potential material for high-end electronics.

Epitaxial graphene uniformly doped to the Dirac point displays an (electrical) resistance dominated by quantum localization and thermal relaxation of carriers governed by electron diffusion. This combination enables highly sensitive and wideband coherent detection of signals from 90 to 700\u2009GHz and, prospectively, across the entire terahertz range. Proof-of-concept graphene bolometric mixers showed an electron diffusion-limited gain bandwidth of 8\u2009GHz and intrinsic mixer noise temperature of 475\u2009K. In theory, an optimized device will result in a mixer noise temperature as low as 36\u2009K, with the gain bandwidth exceeding 20\u2009GHz, that is, approaching quantum-limited sensing in the terahertz domain. This performance potentially surpasses superconducting technologies used in terahertz astronomical detectors, and makes epitaxial graphene particularly attractive for the development of future heterodyne arrays.\n\n===Other===\nThe graphene on SiC can be also an ideal platform for structured graphene (transducers, membranes).<ref name=\"Mis16\"/>\n\n==Open problems==\n\nLimitations in terms of wafer sizes, wafer costs and availability of micromachining processes have to be taken into account when using SiC wafers.<ref name=\"Mis16\"/>\n\nAnother problem is directly coupled with the advantage. of growing the graphene directly on a semiconducting or semi-insulating substrate which is commercially available. But there's no perfect method yet to transfer the graphene to other substrates. For this application, epitaxial growth on copper is a promising method. The carbon's solubility into copper is extremely low and therefore mainly surface diffusion and nucleation of carbon atoms are involved.

This number can be determined by using the quantized oscillations of the electron reflectivity. Electrons have a wave character. If they are shot on the graphene surface, they can be reflected either from the graphene surface or from the graphene-SiC interface. The reflected electrons (waves) can interfere with each other. The electron reflectivity itself changes periodically as a function of the incident electron energy and the FLG thickness. For example, thinner FLG provides longer oscillation periods. The most suitable technique for these measurements is the [[low-energy electron microscopy]] (LEEM).<ref name=\"Hib10\"/>\n\nInspection with an optical microscope allows surprisingly simple and accurate identification of single and multilayer graphene domains in epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide (SiC/G) and is informative about nanoscopic details of the SiC topography, making it ideal for rapid and noninvasive quality control of as-grown SiC/G.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yager |first1=T. |last2=Lartsev |first2=A. |last3=Mahashabde |first3=S. |last4=Charpentier |first4=S. |last5=Davidovikj |first5=D. |last6=Danilov |first6=A. |last7=Yakimova |first7=R. |last8=Panchal |first8=V. |last9=Kazakova |first9=O. |last10=Tzalenchuk |first10=A |last11=Lara-Avila |first11=S. |last12=Kubatkin |first12=S. |title=Express Optical Analysis of Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: Impact of Morphology on Quantum Transport |journal=NanoLetters |volume=13 |issue=9 |doi=10.1021/nl402347g}}</ref> Best results are obtained in combination with non-linear contrast enhancement ([[gamma correction]]), allowing for real time quality control of the as-grown materials and micro devices.\n\n==Applications==\nFurthermore, epitaxial graphene on SiC is considered as a potential material for high-end electronics.

Epitaxial graphene uniformly doped to the Dirac point displays an (electrical) resistance dominated by quantum localization and thermal relaxation of carriers governed by electron diffusion. This combination enables highly sensitive and wideband coherent detection of signals from 90 to 700\u2009GHz and, prospectively, across the entire terahertz range. Proof-of-concept graphene bolometric mixers showed an electron diffusion-limited gain bandwidth of 8\u2009GHz and intrinsic mixer noise temperature of 475\u2009K. In theory, an optimized device will result in a mixer noise temperature as low as 36\u2009K, with the gain bandwidth exceeding 20\u2009GHz, that is, approaching quantum-limited sensing in the terahertz domain. This performance potentially surpasses superconducting technologies used in terahertz astronomical detectors, and makes epitaxial graphene particularly attractive for the development of future heterodyne arrays.\n\n===Other===\nThe graphene on SiC can be also an ideal platform for structured graphene (transducers, membranes).<ref name=\"Mis16\"/>\n\n==Open problems==\n\nLimitations in terms of wafer sizes, wafer costs and availability of micromachining processes have to be taken into account when using SiC wafers.<ref name=\"Mis16\"/>\n\nAnother problem is directly coupled with the advantage. of growing the graphene directly on a semiconducting or semi-insulating substrate which is commercially available. But there's no perfect method yet to transfer the graphene to other substrates. For this application, epitaxial growth on copper is a promising method. The carbon's solubility into copper is extremely low and therefore mainly surface diffusion and nucleation of carbon atoms are involved. Because of this and the growth kinetics, the graphene thickness is limited to predominantly a monolayer. The big advantage is that the graphene can be grown on Cu foil and subsequently transferred to for example SiO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"Gao10\">{{cite journal|title=Epitaxial Graphene on Cu(111) |year=2010 |journal=Nano Letters |volume=10 |pages=3512\u20133516 |issue=9 |last1=Gao |first1=Li |last2=Guest |first2=Jeffrey R. |last3=Guisinger |first3=Nathan P. |doi=10.1021/nl1016706|pmid=20677798 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Carbide-derived carbon]]\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
