He joined the Navy at the age of 15, serving in [[World War II]] in the Pacific.

He worked closely with Joseph Albers, [[James Rosati]] and [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], and produced his monumental work, ''Column,'' (1963) for Rudolph's new building for the Yale Art & Architecture program.<ref>[https://culturenow.org/entry&permalink=09110&seo=Column_Robert-Engman-and-Yale-University Engman, Robert, ''Column,'' (1963)] Culture Now: Museum Without Walls.

He was a frequent visiting critic at East Coast schools of art during his teaching career.  In the 1960s and '70s, his career flourished, with successful New York gallery shows and larger and larger scale commissions, culminating in ''Triune,''(1975) a 20-foot-high structure of interlocking bronze curves.\n\n===Haverford: the Private Studio: After 1978===\nThe physical effort required to complete ''Triune'' brought a check to Engman's artistic drive to \"dominate the materials.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rosner |first1=Stanley |last2=Abt |first2=Lawrence Edwin |title=The Creative Experience |date=1970 |publisher=University of Michigan |page=382}}</ref> In 1978, he changed his approach to art. With rare exceptions, Engman eschewed the [[factory]] approach to sculpture, preferring to personally construct his pieces. He retreated from the world of large-scale commissions, and began work on a series of more intimately-scaled pieces that did not require a workshop of helpers to complete.\n\n==Theory of Sculpture==\nThe sinuous curves of Engman's work are derived from the artist\u2019s explorations of [[minimal surfaces]] to generate sculptural form.

He joined the Navy at the age of 15, serving in [[World War II]] in the Pacific. He graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design with a BFA, and from Yale University with an MFA in Painting and in Sculpture (1955), where he studied with sculptor [[Jos\u00e9 de Rivera]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Sculptor Robert Engman featured in monographic exhibition at the Michener Art Museum |url=https://artdaily.cc/news/91962/Sculptor-Robert-Engman-featured-in-monographic-exhibition-at-the-Michener-Art-Museum |publisher=Art Daily |date=December 29, 2016}}</ref> and [[Josef Albers]].<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/publicart/column.html ''Column, 1963'', Public art at Yale]</ref> Albers wrote of him: \u201cOnly a few independent ones were courageous enough to concentrate on the plane\u2014the in-between of volume and line\u2014as a broad sculptural concept and promise.\u201d<ref name=\"LVAC\">{{cite web|title=Robert Engman|url=https://listart.mit.edu/sites/default/files/Engman_Robert.pdf|website=List Visual Arts Center|publisher=MIT|accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===The Yale Years: 1953-1964===\nEngman taught sculpture at [[Yale University]], and, in 1960, was appointed director of Yale's sculpture program in its Graduate School of Fine Arts.

He was a frequent visiting critic at East Coast schools of art during his teaching career.  In the 1960s and '70s, his career flourished, with successful New York gallery shows and larger and larger scale commissions, culminating in ''Triune,''(1975) a 20-foot-high structure of interlocking bronze curves.\n\n===Haverford: the Private Studio: After 1978===\nThe physical effort required to complete ''Triune'' brought a check to Engman's artistic drive to \"dominate the materials.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rosner |first1=Stanley |last2=Abt |first2=Lawrence Edwin |title=The Creative Experience |date=1970 |publisher=University of Michigan |page=382}}</ref> In 1978, he changed his approach to art. With rare exceptions, Engman eschewed the [[factory]] approach to sculpture, prefering to personally construct his pieces. He retreated from the world of large-scale commissions, and began work on a series of more intimately-scaled pieces that did not require a workshop of helpers to complete.\n\n==Theory of Sculpture==\nThe sinuous curves of Engman's work are derived from the artist\u2019s explorations of [[minimal surfaces]] to generate sculptural form. Minimal surfaces are mathematically the most economical connections between loops or lines in three-dimensional space. Engman created assemblages of minimal surface configurations to form geometrically-based sculptures that could, at the time of their production, be described mathematically only ''after'' they had been physically created in metal or wood.

Joffe]]. The screenplay was written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]]. Allen co-stars as a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer who dates a 17-year-old girl ([[Mariel Hemingway]]) but falls in love with his best friend ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]])'s mistress ([[Diane Keaton]]). [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Anne Byrne (actress)|Anne Byrne]] also star.\n\n''Manhattan'' was filmed in [[black-and-white]] and [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and presently used aspect ratios|2.35:1 widescreen]]. It features music by [[George Gershwin]], including ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which inspired the film. Allen described the film as a combination of ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Interiors]]''.<ref name=\"combo\" />\n\nThe film received critical acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Hemingway and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen]] for Allen and Brickman. Its North American box-office receipts of $39.9 million made it Allen's second biggest box-office hit (adjusting for inflation). Often considered one of his best films, it ranks 46th on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] list and number 63 on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo's]] \"100 Funniest Movies\".<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/person/79388/Woody-Allen/biography Woody Allen \u2013 Biography] by Jason Ankeny (Rovi), in ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref><ref>[http://altscreen.com/01/22/2012/saturday-editors-pick-manhattan-1979/ Article] in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' by [[Bilge Ebiri]] on AFI Top 100</ref> In 2001 the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of images of [[Manhattan]] and other parts of [[New York City]] accompanied by [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', with Isaac Davis ([[Woody Allen]]) narrating drafts of an introduction to a book about a man who loves the city. Isaac is a twice-divorced, 42-year-old television comedy writer who quits his unfulfilling job. He is dating Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), a 17-year-old girl attending the [[Dalton School]]. His best friend, college professor Yale Pollack ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]), married to Emily (Anne Byrne), is having an affair with Mary Wilkie ([[Diane Keaton]]). Mary's ex-husband and former teacher, Jeremiah ([[Wallace Shawn]]), also appears, and Isaac's ex-wife Jill Davis ([[Meryl Streep]]) is writing a confessional book about their marriage. Jill has also since [[Coming out|come out]] as a [[lesbian]] and lives with her partner, Connie (Karen Ludwig).\n\nWhen Isaac meets Mary, her cultural snobbery rubs him the wrong way. Isaac runs into her again at an [[Equal Rights Amendment]] fund-raising event at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted by [[Bella Abzug]] (playing herself) and accompanies her on a cab ride home. They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in the iconic shot of the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy but emphasizes that theirs cannot be a serious relationship and encourages her to go to London to study acting. In another iconic scene, at Tracy's request, they go on a carriage ride through [[Central Park]].\n\nAfter Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests that Isaac ask her out. Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him. Isaac breaks up with Tracy, much to her dismay, and before long, Mary has virtually moved into his apartment. Emily is curious about Isaac's new girlfriend. The two couples enjoy a day out and upon walking down a street Isaac spots Jill's new book ''Marriage, Divorce, and Selfhood''. Emily proceeds to read parts of the book aloud, including passages about a [[Threesome|m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]] Isaac had with Jill and another woman, and an incident where Isaac attempted to run Connie over, much to Mary and Yale's amusement. Thoroughly humiliated, Isaac confronts Jill, who responds stoically and mentions a film rights deal she has acquired. Upon returning home, Isaac learns from Mary that she is returning to Yale and wants to break up. A betrayed Isaac confronts Yale at the college where he teaches, and Yale argues that he found Mary first. Isaac discusses Yale's extramarital affairs with Emily and learns that Yale told her Isaac introduced Mary to him.\n\nIn the [[d\u00e9nouement]], Isaac lies on his sofa, musing into a tape recorder about the things that make \"life worth living\". When he finds himself saying \"Tracy's face\", he sets down the microphone. Unable to reach her by phone, he sets out for Tracy's on foot. He arrives at her family's apartment building just as she is leaving for London. He asks her not to go and says he does not want \"that thing about [her] that [he] like[s]\" to change. She replies that the plans have already been made and reassures him that \"not everybody gets corrupted\" before saying \"you have to have a little faith in people\". He gives her a slight smile, with a final coy look to the camera then segueing into final shots of the skyline with some bars of ''Rhapsody in Blue'' playing again. An instrumental version of \"[[Embraceable You]]\" plays over the credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Isaac Davis\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Mary Wilkie\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Yale Pollack\n* [[Mariel Hemingway]] as Tracy\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Jill Davis\n* [[Anne Byrne (actress)|Anne Byrne]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0126117/bio|title=Anne Byrne Hoffman|website=IMDb}}</ref> as Emily Pollack\n* [[Michael O'Donoghue]] as Dennis\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Jeremiah\n** This was Shawn's film debut\n* Karen Ludwig <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525023/|title=Karen Ludwig|website=IMDb}}</ref> as Connie\n* [[Charles Levin (actor)|Charles Levin]], [[Karen Allen]], and [[David Rasche]] as Television actors\n* [[Mark Linn-Baker]] and [[Frances Conroy]] as Shakespearean actors\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAccording to Allen, the idea for ''Manhattan'' originated from his love of Gershwin's music.

His best friend, college professor Yale Pollack ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]), married to Emily (Anne Byrne), is having an affair with Mary Wilkie ([[Diane Keaton]]). Mary's ex-husband and former teacher, Jeremiah ([[Wallace Shawn]]), also appears, and Isaac's ex-wife Jill Davis ([[Meryl Streep]]) is writing a confessional book about their marriage. Jill has also since [[Coming out|come out]] as a [[lesbian]] and lives with her partner, Connie (Karen Ludwig).\n\nWhen Isaac meets Mary, her cultural snobbery rubs him the wrong way. Isaac runs into her again at an [[Equal Rights Amendment]] fund-raising event at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted by [[Bella Abzug]] (playing herself) and accompanies her on a cab ride home. They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in the iconic shot of the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy but emphasizes that theirs cannot be a serious relationship and encourages her to go to London to study acting. In another iconic scene, at Tracy's request, they go on a carriage ride through [[Central Park]].\n\nAfter Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests that Isaac ask her out. Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him. Isaac breaks up with Tracy, much to her dismay, and before long, Mary has virtually moved into his apartment. Emily is curious about Isaac's new girlfriend. The two couples enjoy a day out and upon walking down a street Isaac spots Jill's new book ''Marriage, Divorce, and Selfhood''. Emily proceeds to read parts of the book aloud, including passages about a [[Threesome|m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]] Isaac had with Jill and another woman, and an incident where Isaac attempted to run Connie over, much to Mary and Yale's amusement. Thoroughly humiliated, Isaac confronts Jill, who responds stoically and mentions a film rights deal she has acquired. Upon returning home, Isaac learns from Mary that she is returning to Yale and wants to break up. A betrayed Isaac confronts Yale at the college where he teaches, and Yale argues that he found Mary first. Isaac discusses Yale's extramarital affairs with Emily and learns that Yale told her Isaac introduced Mary to him.\n\nIn the [[d\u00e9nouement]], Isaac lies on his sofa, musing into a tape recorder about the things that make \"life worth living\". When he finds himself saying \"Tracy's face\", he sets down the microphone. Unable to reach her by phone, he sets out for Tracy's on foot. He arrives at her family's apartment building just as she is leaving for London. He asks her not to go and says he does not want \"that thing about [her] that [he] like[s]\" to change. She replies that the plans have already been made and reassures him that \"not everybody gets corrupted\" before saying \"you have to have a little faith in people\". He gives her a slight smile, with a final coy look to the camera then segueing into final shots of the skyline with some bars of ''Rhapsody in Blue'' playing again. An instrumental version of \"[[Embraceable You]]\" plays over the credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Isaac Davis\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Mary Wilkie\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Yale Pollack\n* [[Mariel Hemingway]] as Tracy\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Jill Davis\n* [[Anne Byrne (actress)|Anne Byrne]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0126117/bio|title=Anne Byrne Hoffman|website=IMDb}}</ref> as Emily Pollack\n* [[Michael O'Donoghue]] as Dennis\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Jeremiah\n** This was Shawn's film debut\n* Karen Ludwig <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525023/|title=Karen Ludwig|website=IMDb}}</ref> as Connie\n* [[Charles Levin (actor)|Charles Levin]], [[Karen Allen]], and [[David Rasche]] as Television actors\n* [[Mark Linn-Baker]] and [[Frances Conroy]] as Shakespearean actors\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAccording to Allen, the idea for ''Manhattan'' originated from his love of Gershwin's music.

When Dr. Samuel Mullens sold the school to John Augustus Williams (the founder of Christian College in Columbia, Mo. and president of [[Bacon College]] when it was located in Harrodsburg), Williams changed the name to Daughters College and advertised that it could handle 100 students offering Philosophy, English language and literature, mathematics, natural science, history, ancient and modern languages, Bible studies, and fine arts. The college graduated classes of 2 to 17 each year; and after they added a regular normal department, produced more than 1/3 of all its graduates as teachers. In 1895 he sold it to Col. Thomas Smith, a graduate of [[University of Virginia]] and Confederate veteran, who taught the students seven different languages. It was he who changed the name to Beaumont College. It closed in 1917 and one of the graduates turned it into an inn to accommodate the high demand for accommodations from its graduates who wanted to return for vacations and class reunions.\n* [[Bethel College (Kentucky)|Bethel College]], [[Russellville, Kentucky|Russellville]] chartered by the state in 1854 as Bethel Female High School in Hopkinsville, the Green River Educational Convention named it the Bethel College for Women in 1858. The [[Russellville Convention]] used the college building for one of their meetings to establish the Kentucky Confederate government and soon thereafter was occupied by the federal army during the rest of the Civil War. The school finally opened again in March 1864, offering curriculum from five departments of languages, mathematics, mental and moral science, and belles-lettres, natural science, and fine arts. The college had a faculty of 6-10 teachers with an average attendance of approximately 100 students. By the 1890s the administration aspired to model the curriculum after that offered at the [[University of Virginia]] with an aim to make it equal to any of the male colleges in the state. It became Bethel Women's Jr. College in 1917; it became co-ed in 1951; and it closed in 1964.\n* [[Brescia University]], [[Owensboro, Kentucky|Owensboro]], started in 1925 as Mount Saint Joseph College for Women, a junior college in the nearby rural community of Maple Mount. Shortly after the school opened, it established a coeducational extension branch in Owensboro that over the years became a second campus. The school became coeducational in 1950 when the two campuses were merged at the Owensboro site.\n* Caldwell Female College, [[Danville, Kentucky]], was originally chartered by the state as the Henderson Female Institute in 1854; changed its name in 1860 to honor the principle donor, Charles Caldwell who was an elder in the Danville Presbyterian Church. Consolidating with another local girls' school, Bell Seminary, Caldwell Female College gained its first woman president in 1886, Miss Charlotte A. Campbell. Under her leadership, a gymnasium and four new classrooms were added to the building's original site \u2013 and she gained a charter that allowed for the school with its 11 faculty to confer college degrees. In 1913 the charter was amended to consolidate with the Princeton Collegiate Institute and became Kentucky College for Women (see more on this below).\n* [[Campbell\u2013Hagerman College]], [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] (closed; date unknown)\n* [[Cedar Bluff College]], [[Woodburn, Kentucky|Woodburn]], led by Rev. B.F. Cabell who also started the Potter College in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] (see more on this below); closed in 1892.\n* [[Clinton College (Kentucky)|Clinton College]], [[Clinton, Kentucky|Clinton]], founded as Clinton Female College in 1873 by Willis White, a Baptist preacher and funded through the West Union Baptist Association (later the West Ky. Baptist Association); it became co-ed in 1876; and it closed in 1915.\n* Georgetown Female College, [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]], founded in 1846 by J. E. Farnham, a natural sciences professor at [[Georgetown College]]; and by the next year a new building was constructed on Hamilton Street by the next year to accommodate 100 students. That building burned in 1865, and a professor of Mathematics at Georgetown College, James J. Rucker, used his own private property to continue the school. For two years Prof. J.B. Thorp served as principal. In 1869 Professor Rucker stepped in as principal once [[Georgetown College]] built a new building on the college grounds. It was incorporated into the College in 1893 when it became co-educational. The building then became a dormitory.\n* [[Hamilton College (Kentucky)|Hamilton College]], [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] was founded by banker and Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) member James M. Hocker in 1869. Originally named the Hocker Female College, in 1878 the name of the school changed to Hamilton College. By 1896 the graduating class was 24 women. In 1889, the nearby Kentucky University, (later Transylvania University), bought a stake in the school, taking total control in 1903. It remained a private, women's college affiliated with the Disciples of Christ and closed in 1932.\n* John Lyle's Female Seminary (established in 1806)<ref name=\"Welch, Kristen &, Ruelas, Abraham\"/>\n* Kentucky College for Young Ladies, [[Pewee Valley]], was chartered and opened in fall 1874 with Professor E.A. Sloan, A.M. as president, 8 teachers offering a two-year preparatory school and a four-year collegiate course of studies. The college gained a new library donated by suffragist [http://kdl.kyvl.org/catalog/xt71zc7rnf2z/guide Mrs. Brutus J. (Ann Field) Clay]. That year there were 68 students in attendance, most of whom were in the collegiate department, and the first class of nine graduated. In the 1880s, Rev. Erastus Rowley, D.D. of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] South, purchased the school and added a primary department as well as sciences, business and a normal department in the collegiate division. Boys were allowed for day classes when in 1896 the new president G.B. Perry combined the primary and preparatory departments into a preparatory course of four years and added a one-year postgraduate department which included then history, mathematics, science, Latin, mental and moral philosophy, English and \"the usual ornamental branches.\" The faculty numbered 10 by the end of the century when the building was destroyed by fire. This school was the inspiration of \"Lloydsboro Seminary\" in one of the popular Little Colonel books by [[Annie Fellows Johnston]], ''The Little Colonel at Boarding School'' (Boston: LC Page & Co, 1904). In 1902 the state purchased the school building for the use of a Confederate veterans' home.\n* [[Kentucky College for Women]], [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]], formerly Caldwell Female College, merged with [[Centre College]] in 1926 (as the women's department) but did not formally consolidate with Centre until 1930. Women students didn't move to the Centre campus until 1962 as part of a strategy to increase the size of the student body overall (from 380 to 700) and major revision of the curriculum.\n* [https://archive.is/20130410101756/http://205.204.134.47:2010/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/RB&CISOPTR=1069&REC=1 Lexington Female College], [[Lexington, Kentucky]]\n* Logan Female College, [[Russellville, Kentucky|Russellville]] grew out of the Methodist-affiliated school for boys and girls known as \"The Academy\" and was chartered by the state in 1856. Led by a succession of ministers out of the Louisville Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the college was granted in 1860 by the state to confer diplomas under the name of the Russellville Collegiate Institute, but it returned to the name Logan Female College after the Civil War, graduating its first class of seven baccalaureate degree earners in 1869. It became famous in the 1870s for the curriculum in English and Anglo-Saxon. With a faculty of 12 in the 1890s the college curriculum included the departments of Latin, English, mathematics, natural science, history Bible studies, philosophy, political science, elocution, Anglo-Saxon, Greek, French and German \u2013 offering a bachelor of arts, bachelor of science and bachelor of laws. In addition the school offered primary and preparatory studies as well as departments of music and art. The Louisville Conference voted to close Logan Female College in 1931 due to financial problems.\n* [[Lynnland Female Institute]] or Lynnland Female College, [[Glendale, Kentucky]] started in 1867 under the leadership of a local Baptist minister, Rev. G. A. Colson. In 1869, a former Confederate general, William F. Perry of Alabama (once the president of the East Alabama Female College in Tuskegee) came to serve as president of the Lynnland Female Institute and introduced a classical education for collegiate level learning. This was favorably received and he recruited support from John Peyton Hobson who was recommended by Washington College president, Robert E. Lee. In the 1870s Perry and Peter Eppes Harris turned the school co-educational as the Lynnland Military Institution with the women taught in a separate department. But it closed in 1879 and Perry left for Bowling Green where he taught at Ogden College until his death. By 1888 the school returned to its former status as a college for women and renamed \"Lynnland Female College\" growing to as many as 60 students and a school library that rivaled Barnard or Rutgers in the north. After the 1914-15 academic term, Lynnland was sold and became the site of an orphanage, the Kentucky Baptist Children's Home (later named the Glendale Center). Today the site is empty - the Glendale Center was relocated to Elizabethtown.\n* [[Midway University]], [[Midway, Kentucky|Midway]] \u2014 first opened in 1847 by the Disciples of Christ as the [[Kentucky Female Orphan School]], it grew into a junior college and after World War II it offered baccalaureate degrees as one of Kentucky's few remaining women's colleges. By the mid-1970s, following the closure or change to coeducation of the state's other women's colleges, it became Kentucky's only remaining all-women's college. The school gradually transitioned away from being a pure women's college, establishing coeducational programs for evening, weekend, and later online students; during this time, it also abandoned an attempt to start a pharmacy school. The transition was completed in 2016 when men were first admitted to Midway's daytime undergraduate program.\n* Millersburg Female College started first as a Female Collegiate Institute in [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]] in 1837 by Thornton F. Johnson, affiliated with the [[Disciples of Christ]], and run by his wife, Margaret Fauntleroy Johnson; he was also founder of several other colleges, including Bacon College, the precursor of [[University of Kentucky]]. Mrs. Johnson hired three sisters ([https://books.google.com/books?id=FChEAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA291 Caroline, Sarah and Harriet Stanwood]). They moved the college in 1849 to the Batterson residence in Millersburg, and through the 1850s it was coeducational. In February 1860 the state granted a charter to the Millersburg Female College, and in June 1867 it graduated its first class of four women. By the 1890s with 13 teachers, the graduates typically became musicians and teachers. In 1908 a new building replaced the structure that had burned down the year before and a basic junior college curriculum offered an associate of arts degree. In 1915 the Female College was renamed Millersburg College and in 1931 the nearby Millersburg Military Institute purchased it and offered there an elementary school for its junior cadets. College and a normal department was established in 1862. \n* [[Nazareth College (Kentucky)|Nazareth Academy]], [[Nelson County, Kentucky|Nelson County]] \u2014 Founded in 1814 by the Catholic [[Sisters of Charity of Nazareth]]; moved from its original site outside of [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]] to [[Nazareth, Kentucky|Nazareth]] in 1822. Received authority to grant degrees in 1829; later designated as a \"College\". For further history, see Spalding College below.\n* Owensboro Female College opened in the fall of 1890 and chartered on March 26, 1893, to offer literary degrees: mistress of arts and mistress of belles-lettres. By 1931 the building was taken over by the Owensboro Trade School, and in 1939 the building was demolished in favor of a new building.\n* Pleasant J. Potter College, [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] opened on September 9, 1889, with Rev. B.F. Cabell as president. The charter assured no sectarian control by stipulated that not more than two of its ten trustees be members of the same religious denomination. In addition to music and art, the preparatory and collegiate departments offered English, history, natural sciences, Latin, mathematics, philosophy, elocution, Greek, French and German \u2013 offering certificates of proficiency as well as an A.B. Eleven faculty and 200 students many of whom transferred in from other institutions in the South and the West and at the end of the first year 9 graduated from the various departments of the college. Potter College closed in 1909, and Western State Normal School moved to the Potter College site in 1911 (which became [[Western Kentucky University]] in 1966).\n* [[Sayre School|Sayre Female Institute]], [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] was founded by David A. and Abby Hammond Sayre in November 1854. Sayre, meeting in the offices of former Kentucky Secretary of State George B. Kinkead with several other prominent members of the \"McChord\" (now [[First Presbyterian Church (Lexington, Kentucky)|First Presbyterian]] Church) including [[John C. Breckinridge]], drew up the articles of incorporation. Originally named the Transylvania Female Seminary, the school opened first in the old Bank of the U.S. building on the corner of Mill and Church then moved to the current location on Limestone Street. In 1855 the trustees changed the name to the Sayre Female Institute, and the state granted its charter in 1856 to confer collegiate degrees. By the 1890s the yearly attendance reached over 300 students with a faculty of nearly 15 teachers. Sayre graduated as many as 20 students each year, many of whom became teachers. It became co-ed after [[World War I]] and became a college preparatory school in 1962. See the {{NRHP url|id=82002695|title=National Register nomination form}} for more details about the historic significance of this former college and its historic building designed by Major Thomas Lewinski.\n* [[Spalding University#History|Spalding College]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] \u2014 Founded in 1920 by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth as the Louisville campus of Nazareth College. Instruction continued at both locations until 1971, when all instruction was moved to Louisville. The school became Spalding College in 1969, and became coeducational in 1973. It adopted its current name of Spalding University in 1984.\n* [[St. Catharine College]], [[Springfield, Kentucky|Springfield]] (co-ed in 1951; closed in 2016) \n* [[Stanford Female College]], [[Stanford]], chartered in 1871 by a joint stock company; in the fall of 1872 it opened with Mrs. Sallie C. Truehart, A.M. as the first president, offering collegiate degrees with 11 teachers and approximately 100 students in primary, secondary and collegiate classes. In 1885 A.S. Paxton reformed the curriculum to model that of [[Washington and Lee University]], and the school offered its graduates a diploma without degree from four of its departments, the degree of M.E.L. from completion of the English department and with additional work in Latin, a degree of A.B. The college closed in 1907 and the building housed the Stanford Elementary School until 1931 when it was converted into an apartment complex and since 1939 has served as a funeral home.\n* [[Bellarmine University#Expansion and growth|Ursuline College]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] (merged into [[Bellarmine University|Bellarmine College]] in 1968)\n* [[Thomas More University#History|Villa Madonna College]], [[Covington, Kentucky|Covington]], was founded in 1921 by the Benedictine Sisters of Covington and chartered by the state in 1923. While Villa Madonna was a women's college, it ran many coeducational classes through an affiliation with the all-male St. Thomas More College. In 1945, Villa Madonna became coeducational and St. Thomas More was abolished. The school changed its name to Thomas More College in 1968, the same year it moved to its current campus in [[Crestview Hills, Kentucky|Crestview Hills]], and adopted its current name of [[Thomas More University]] in 2018.\n\n===Louisiana===\n* [[College of the Sacred Heart (Louisiana)|College of the Sacred Heart]], [[Grand Coteau, Louisiana|Grand Coteau]] (closed in 1956, see [[Academy of the Sacred Heart (Grand Coteau, Louisiana)|Academy of the Sacred Heart]])\n* [[Dodd College]], [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] (closed in 1942)\n* [[H.

When Dr. Samuel Mullens sold the school to John Augustus Williams (the founder of Christian College in Columbia, Mo. and president of [[Bacon College]] when it was located in Harrodsburg), Williams changed the name to Daughters College and advertised that it could handle 100 students offering Philosophy, English language and literature, mathematics, natural science, history, ancient and modern languages, Bible studies, and fine arts. The college graduated classes of 2 to 17 each year; and after they added a regular normal department, produced more than 1/3 of all its graduates as teachers. In 1895 he sold it to Col. Thomas Smith, a graduate of [[University of Virginia]] and Confederate veteran, who taught the students seven different languages. It was he who changed the name to Beaumont College. It closed in 1917 and one of the graduates turned it into an inn to accommodate the high demand for accommodations from its graduates who wanted to return for vacations and class reunions.\n* [[Bethel College (Kentucky)|Bethel College]], [[Russellville, Kentucky|Russellville]] chartered by the state in 1854 as Bethel Female High School in Hopkinsville, the Green River Educational Convention named it the Bethel College for Women in 1858. The [[Russellville Convention]] used the college building for one of their meetings to establish the Kentucky Confederate government and soon thereafter was occupied by the federal army during the rest of the Civil War. The school finally opened again in March 1864, offering curriculum from five departments of languages, mathematics, mental and moral science, and belles-lettres, natural science, and fine arts. The college had a faculty of 6-10 teachers with an average attendance of approximately 100 students. By the 1890s the administration aspired to model the curriculum after that offered at the [[University of Virginia]] with an aim to make it equal to any of the male colleges in the state. It became Bethel Women's Jr. College in 1917; it became co-ed in 1951; and it closed in 1964.\n* [[Brescia University]], [[Owensboro, Kentucky|Owensboro]], started in 1925 as Mount Saint Joseph College for Women, a junior college in the nearby rural community of Maple Mount. Shortly after the school opened, it established a coeducational extension branch in Owensboro that over the years became a second campus. The school became coeducational in 1950 when the two campuses were merged at the Owensboro site.\n* Caldwell Female College, [[Danville, Kentucky]], was originally chartered by the state as the Henderson Female Institute in 1854; changed its name in 1860 to honor the principle donor, Charles Caldwell who was an elder in the Danville Presbyterian Church. Consolidating with another local girls' school, Bell Seminary, Caldwell Female College gained its first woman president in 1886, Miss Charlotte A. Campbell. Under her leadership, a gymnasium and four new classrooms were added to the building's original site \u2013 and she gained a charter that allowed for the school with its 11 faculty to confer college degrees. In 1913 the charter was amended to consolidate with the Princeton Collegiate Institute and became Kentucky College for Women (see more on this below).\n* [[Campbell\u2013Hagerman College]], [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] (closed; date unknown)\n* [[Cedar Bluff College]], [[Woodburn, Kentucky|Woodburn]], led by Rev. B.F. Cabell who also started the Potter College in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] (see more on this below); closed in 1892.\n* [[Clinton College (Kentucky)|Clinton College]], [[Clinton, Kentucky|Clinton]], founded as Clinton Female College in 1873 by Willis White, a Baptist preacher and funded through the West Union Baptist Association (later the West Ky. Baptist Association); it became co-ed in 1876; and it closed in 1915.\n* Georgetown Female College, [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]], founded in 1846 by J. E. Farnham, a natural sciences professor at [[Georgetown College]]; and by the next year a new building was constructed on Hamilton Street by the next year to accommodate 100 students. That building burned in 1865, and a professor of Mathematics at Georgetown College, James J. Rucker, used his own private property to continue the school. For two years Prof. J.B. Thorp served as principal. In 1869 Professor Rucker stepped in as principal once [[Georgetown College]] built a new building on the college grounds. It was incorporated into the College in 1893 when it became co-educational. The building then became a dormitory.\n* [[Hamilton College (Kentucky)|Hamilton College]], [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] was founded by banker and Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) member James M. Hocker in 1869. Originally named the Hocker Female College, in 1878 the name of the school changed to Hamilton College. By 1896 the graduating class was 24 women. In 1889, the nearby Kentucky University, (later Transylvania University), bought a stake in the school, taking total control in 1903. It remained a private, women's college affiliated with the Disciples of Christ and closed in 1932.\n* John Lyle's Female Seminary (established in 1806)<ref name=\"Welch, Kristen &, Ruelas, Abraham\"/>\n* Kentucky College for Young Ladies, [[Pewee Valley]], was chartered and opened in fall 1874 with Professor E.A. Sloan, A.M. as president, 8 teachers offering a two-year preparatory school and a four-year collegiate course of studies. The college gained a new library donated by suffragist [http://kdl.kyvl.org/catalog/xt71zc7rnf2z/guide Mrs. Brutus J. (Ann Field) Clay]. That year there were 68 students in attendance, most of whom were in the collegiate department, and the first class of nine graduated. In the 1880s, Rev. Erastus Rowley, D.D. of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] South, purchased the school and added a primary department as well as sciences, business and a normal department in the collegiate division. Boys were allowed for day classes when in 1896 the new president G.B. Perry combined the primary and preparatory departments into a preparatory course of four years and added a one-year postgraduate department which included then history, mathematics, science, Latin, mental and moral philosophy, English and \"the usual ornamental branches.\" The faculty numbered 10 by the end of the century when the building was destroyed by fire. This school was the inspiration of \"Lloydsboro Seminary\" in one of the popular Little Colonel books by [[Annie Fellows Johnston]], ''The Little Colonel at Boarding School'' (Boston: LC Page & Co, 1904). In 1902 the state purchased the school building for the use of a Confederate veterans' home.\n* [[Kentucky College for Women]], [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]], formerly Caldwell Female College, merged with [[Centre College]] in 1926 (as the women's department) but did not formally consolidate with Centre until 1930. Women students didn't move to the Centre campus until 1962 as part of a strategy to increase the size of the student body overall (from 380 to 700) and major revision of the curriculum.\n* [https://archive.is/20130410101756/http://205.204.134.47:2010/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/RB&CISOPTR=1069&REC=1 Lexington Female College], [[Lexington, Kentucky]]\n* Logan Female College, [[Russellville, Kentucky|Russellville]] grew out of the Methodist-affiliated school for boys and girls known as \"The Academy\" and was chartered by the state in 1856. Led by a succession of ministers out of the Louisville Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the college was granted in 1860 by the state to confer diplomas under the name of the Russellville Collegiate Institute, but it returned to the name Logan Female College after the Civil War, graduating its first class of seven baccalaureate degree earners in 1869. It became famous in the 1870s for the curriculum in English and Anglo-Saxon. With a faculty of 12 in the 1890s the college curriculum included the departments of Latin, English, mathematics, natural science, history Bible studies, philosophy, political science, elocution, Anglo-Saxon, Greek, French and German \u2013 offering a bachelor of arts, bachelor of science and bachelor of laws. In addition the school offered primary and preparatory studies as well as departments of music and art. The Louisville Conference voted to close Logan Female College in 1931 due to financial problems.\n* [[Lynnland Female Institute]] or Lynnland Female College, [[Glendale, Kentucky]] started in 1867 under the leadership of a local Baptist minister, Rev. G. A. Colson. In 1869, a former Confederate general, William F. Perry of Alabama (once the president of the East Alabama Female College in Tuskegee) came to serve as president of the Lynnland Female Institute and introduced a classical education for collegiate level learning. This was favorably received and he recruited support from John Peyton Hobson who was recommended by Washington College president, Robert E. Lee. In the 1870s Perry and Peter Eppes Harris turned the school co-educational as the Lynnland Military Institution with the women taught in a separate department. But it closed in 1879 and Perry left for Bowling Green where he taught at Ogden College until his death. By 1888 the school returned to its former status as a college for women and renamed \"Lynnland Female College\" growing to as many as 60 students and a school library that rivaled Barnard or Rutgers in the north. After the 1914-15 academic term, Lynnland was sold and became the site of an orphanage, the Kentucky Baptist Children's Home (later named the Glendale Center). Today the site is empty - the Glendale Center was relocated to Elizabethtown.\n* [[Midway University]], [[Midway, Kentucky|Midway]] \u2014 first opened in 1847 by the Disciples of Christ as the [[Kentucky Female Orphan School]], it grew into a junior college and after World War II it offered baccalaureate degrees as one of Kentucky's few remaining women's colleges. By the mid-1970s, following the closure or change to coeducation of the state's other women's colleges, it became Kentucky's only remaining all-women's college. The school gradually transitioned away from being a pure women's college, establishing coeducational programs for evening, weekend, and later online students; during this time, it also abandoned an attempt to start a pharmacy school. The transition was completed in 2016 when men were first admitted to Midway's daytime undergraduate program.\n* Millersburg Female College started first as a Female Collegiate Institute in [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]] in 1837 by Thornton F. Johnson, affiliated with the [[Disciples of Christ]], and run by his wife, Margaret Fauntleroy Johnson; he was also founder of several other colleges, including Bacon College, the precursor of [[University of Kentucky]]. Mrs. Johnson hired three sisters ([https://books.google.com/books?id=FChEAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA291 Caroline, Sarah and Harriet Stanwood]). They moved the college in 1849 to the Batterson residence in Millersburg, and through the 1850s it was coeducational. In February 1860 the state granted a charter to the Millersburg Female College, and in June 1867 it graduated its first class of four women. By the 1890s with 13 teachers, the graduates typically became musicians and teachers. In 1908 a new building replaced the structure that had burned down the year before and a basic junior college curriculum offered an associate of arts degree. In 1915 the Female College was renamed Millersburg College and in 1931 the nearby Millersburg Military Institute purchased it and offered there an elementary school for its junior cadets. College and a normal department was established in 1862. \n* [[Nazareth College (Kentucky)|Nazareth Academy]], [[Nelson County, Kentucky|Nelson County]] \u2014 Founded in 1814 by the Catholic [[Sisters of Charity of Nazareth]]; moved from its original site outside of [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]] to [[Nazareth, Kentucky|Nazareth]] in 1822. Received authority to grant degrees in 1829; later designated as a \"College\". For further history, see Spalding College below.\n* Owensboro Female College opened in the fall of 1890 and chartered on March 26, 1893, to offer literary degrees: mistress of arts and mistress of belles-lettres. By 1931 the building was taken over by the Owensboro Trade School, and in 1939 the building was demolished in favor of a new building.\n* Pleasant J. Potter College, [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] opened on September 9, 1889, with Rev. B.F. Cabell as president. The charter assured no sectarian control by stipulated that not more than two of its ten trustees be members of the same religious denomination. In addition to music and art, the preparatory and collegiate departments offered English, history, natural sciences, Latin, mathematics, philosophy, elocution, Greek, French and German \u2013 offering certificates of proficiency as well as an A.B. Eleven faculty and 200 students many of whom transferred in from other institutions in the South and the West and at the end of the first year 9 graduated from the various departments of the college. Potter College closed in 1909, and Western State Normal School moved to the Potter College site in 1911 (which became [[Western Kentucky University]] in 1966).\n* [[Sayre School|Sayre Female Institute]], [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] was founded by David A. and Abby Hammond Sayre in November 1854. Sayre, meeting in the offices of former Kentucky Secretary of State George B. Kinkead with several other prominent members of the \"McChord\" (now [[First Presbyterian Church (Lexington, Kentucky)|First Presbyterian]] Church) including [[John C. Breckinridge]], drew up the articles of incorporation. Originally named the Transylvania Female Seminary, the school opened first in the old Bank of the U.S. building on the corner of Mill and Church then moved to the current location on Limestone Street. In 1855 the trustees changed the name to the Sayre Female Institute, and the state granted its charter in 1856 to confer collegiate degrees. By the 1890s the yearly attendance reached over 300 students with a faculty of nearly 15 teachers. Sayre graduated as many as 20 students each year, many of whom became teachers. It became co-ed after [[World War I]] and became a college preparatory school in 1962. See the {{NRHP url|id=82002695|title=National Register nomination form}} for more details about the historic significance of this former college and its historic building designed by Major Thomas Lewinski.\n* [[Spalding University#History|Spalding College]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] \u2014 Founded in 1920 by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth as the Louisville campus of Nazareth College. Instruction continued at both locations until 1971, when all instruction was moved to Louisville. The school became Spalding College in 1969, and became coeducational in 1973. It adopted its current name of Spalding University in 1984.\n* [[St. Catharine College]], [[Springfield, Kentucky|Springfield]] (co-ed in 1951; closed in 2016) \n* [[Stanford Female College]], [[Stanford]], chartered in 1871 by a joint stock company; in the fall of 1872 it opened with Mrs. Sallie C. Truehart, A.M. as the first president, offering collegiate degrees with 11 teachers and approximately 100 students in primary, secondary and collegiate classes. In 1885 A.S. Paxton reformed the curriculum to model that of [[Washington and Lee University]], and the school offered its graduates a diploma without degree from four of its departments, the degree of M.E.L. from completion of the English department and with additional work in Latin, a degree of A.B. The college closed in 1907 and the building housed the Stanford Elementary School until 1931 when it was converted into an apartment complex and since 1939 has served as a funeral home.\n* [[Bellarmine University#Expansion and growth|Ursuline College]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] (merged into [[Bellarmine University|Bellarmine College]] in 1968)\n* [[Thomas More University#History|Villa Madonna College]], [[Covington, Kentucky|Covington]], was founded in 1921 by the Benedictine Sisters of Covington and chartered by the state in 1923. While Villa Madonna was a women's college, it ran many coeducational classes through an affiliation with the all-male St. Thomas More College. In 1945, Villa Madonna became coeducational and St. Thomas More was abolished. The school changed its name to Thomas More College in 1968, the same year it moved to its current campus in [[Crestview Hills, Kentucky|Crestview Hills]], and adopted its current name of [[Thomas More University]] in 2018.\n\n===Louisiana===\n* [[College of the Sacred Heart (Louisiana)|College of the Sacred Heart]], [[Grand Coteau, Louisiana|Grand Coteau]] (closed in 1956, see [[Academy of the Sacred Heart (Grand Coteau, Louisiana)|Academy of the Sacred Heart]])\n* [[Dodd College]], [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] (closed in 1942)\n* [[H.

Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor.<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Banich |first=Marie |authorlink=Marie Banich |year=1997 |title=Neuropsychology: The Neural Bases of Mental Function|url=https://archive.org/details/neuropsychologyn00bani |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nVerbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].<ref name=book/>\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nHandedness displays a complex inheritance pattern.

About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left [[occiput]] (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either [[vestibular system|vestibular]] abnormalities or delay,<ref>Nonright-handedness, central nervous system and related pathology, and its lateralization: A reformulation and synthesis.</ref> and asymmetry of the [[vestibular cortex]] is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dieterich | first1 = M. | last2 = Bense | first2 = S. | last3 = Lutz | first3 = S. | last4 = Drzezga | first4 = A. | last5 = Stephan | first5 = T. | last6 = Bartenstein | first6 = P. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Dominance for vestibular cortical function in the non-dominant hemisphere | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 9| pages = 994\u20131007 | pmid = 12902399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.9.994 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n=== Ultrasound ===\nAnother theory is that [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy.

He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.<ref>[http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ Right-Hand, Left-Hand official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504153055/http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ |date=2012-05-04 }} Accessed June 2006.</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Scientific American]],'' McManus states that,\n<blockquote>Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right-handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.<ref>Chris McManus. April 14, 2012.

In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18\u201324 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores.<ref>Nelson, E.L., J.M. Campbell, and G.F.

[[Tight end]]s, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the [[offensive tackle]] on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's \"blind side,\" is typically the most valued member of the offensive line. While uncommon, there have been several [[List of left-handed quarterbacks|notable left-handed quarterbacks]].\n* In [[bowling]], the oil pattern used on the bowling lane [[bowling ball#Effect of lane characteristics on ball motion|breaks down]] faster the more times a ball is rolled down the lane. Bowlers must continually adjust their shots to compensate for the ball's change in rotation as the game or series is played and the oil is altered from its original pattern. A left-handed bowler competes on the opposite side of the lane from the right-handed bowler and therefore deals with less breakdown of the original oil placement. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are possibly 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes.\n\n=== Gender ===\nAccording to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio.<ref name=\"Papadatou\">{{cite journal|last=Papadatou-Pastou|first=M|author2=Martin, M|author3=Munaf\u00f2, MR|author4=Jones, GV|date=September 2008|title=Sex differences in left-handedness: a meta-analysis of 144 studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=134|issue=5|pages=677\u201399|doi=10.1037/a0012814|pmid=18729568}}</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Sexuality and gender identity ===\n{{further|Handedness and sexual orientation}}\nA number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumi\u00e8re ML, Blanchard R, Zucker KJ | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 575\u2013592 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.575 | pmid=10900997}}</ref> though findings are mixed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1023/A:1014039403752 \n| pmid = 11910784 \n| year = 2002 \n| last1 = Mustanski | first1 = B.

In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand.\n\nThe Latin adjective ''sinister'' or ''sinistra'' (as applied to male or female nouns\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u2060Latin nouns are gender specific) means \"left\" as well as \"unlucky\", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words \"sinister\" (meaning both 'evil' and 'on the bearer's left on a coat of arms') and \"ambisinister\" meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand'.\n\nThere are many negative connotations associated with the phrase \"left-handed\": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A \"left-handed compliment\" is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In [[French language|French]], ''gauche'' means both \"left\" and \"awkward\" or \"clumsy\", while ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'' and related to \"adroit\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\". The name \"Dexter\" derives from the Latin for \"right\", as does the word \"dexterity\" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.\n\n[[Black magic]] is sometimes referred to as the \"[[left-hand path]]\".\n\nUntil very recently in [[Taiwan]] (and still in [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea|both North and South Korea]]), left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of [[stroke order]], developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the [[Latin alphabet]] might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward.<ref>[http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm Erste deutsche Beratungs- und Informationsstelle f\u00fcr Linksh\u00e4nder und umge-schulte Linksh\u00e4nder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922143207/http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm |date=2013-09-22 }}.

Occurrences during [[prenatal development]] may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth.<ref>{{cite journal|url=|title=Prenatal thumb sucking is related to postnatal handedness| doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.08.009|pmid=15707608|volume=43|issue=3|journal=Neuropsychologia|pages=313\u2013315|year=2005 | last1 = Hepper | first1 = Peter G.}}</ref> In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson EL, Campbell JM, Michel GF | year = 2013 | title = Unimanual to bimanual: Tracking the development of handedness from 6 to 24 months | journal = Infant Behavior and Development | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 181\u2013188 | pmc=3615031 | doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2013.01.009 | pmid=23454419}}</ref>\n\n=== Division of labor ===\nOne common theory as to how handedness affects the hemispheres is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor.<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Banich |first=Marie |authorlink=Marie Banich |year=1997 |title=Neuropsychology: The Neural Bases of Mental Function|url=https://archive.org/details/neuropsychologyn00bani |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nVerbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].<ref name=book/>\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nHandedness displays a complex inheritance pattern.

About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left [[occiput]] (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either [[vestibular system|vestibular]] abnormalities or delay,<ref>Nonright-handedness, central nervous system and related pathology, and its lateralization: A reformulation and synthesis.</ref> and asymmetry of the [[vestibular cortex]] is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dieterich | first1 = M. | last2 = Bense | first2 = S. | last3 = Lutz | first3 = S. | last4 = Drzezga | first4 = A. | last5 = Stephan | first5 = T. | last6 = Bartenstein | first6 = P. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Dominance for vestibular cortical function in the non-dominant hemisphere | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 9| pages = 994\u20131007 | pmid = 12902399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.9.994 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n=== Ultrasound ===\nAnother theory is that [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy.

He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.<ref>[http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ Right-Hand, Left-Hand official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504153055/http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ |date=2012-05-04 }} Accessed June 2006.</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Scientific American]],'' McManus states that,\n<blockquote>Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right-handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.<ref>Chris McManus. April 14, 2012.

What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler.

[[Tight end]]s, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the [[offensive tackle]] on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's \"blind side,\" is typically the most valued member of the offensive line. While uncommon, there have been several [[List of left-handed quarterbacks|notable left-handed quarterbacks]].\n* In [[bowling]], the oil pattern used on the bowling lane [[bowling ball#Effect of lane characteristics on ball motion|breaks down]] faster the more times a ball is rolled down the lane. Bowlers must continually adjust their shots to compensate for the ball's change in rotation as the game or series is played and the oil is altered from its original pattern. A left-handed bowler competes on the opposite side of the lane from the right-handed bowler and therefore deals with less breakdown of the original oil placement. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are possibly 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes.\n\n=== Gender ===\nAccording to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio.<ref name=\"Papadatou\">{{cite journal|last=Papadatou-Pastou|first=M|author2=Martin, M|author3=Munaf\u00f2, MR|author4=Jones, GV|date=September 2008|title=Sex differences in left-handedness: a meta-analysis of 144 studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=134|issue=5|pages=677\u201399|doi=10.1037/a0012814|pmid=18729568}}</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Sexuality and gender identity ===\n{{further|Handedness and sexual orientation}}\nA number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumi\u00e8re ML, Blanchard R, Zucker KJ | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 575\u2013592 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.575 | pmid=10900997}}</ref> though findings are mixed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1023/A:1014039403752 \n| pmid = 11910784 \n| year = 2002 \n| last1 = Mustanski | first1 = B.

This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a [[dip pen]]. While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains.<ref>McManus, IC.

Press, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Negative connotations and discrimination===\n\nMoreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand.\n\nThe Latin adjective ''sinister'' or ''sinistra'' (as applied to male or female nouns\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u2060Latin nouns are gender specific) means \"left\" as well as \"unlucky\", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words \"sinister\" (meaning both 'evil' and 'on the bearer's left on a coat of arms') and \"ambisinister\" meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand'.\n\nThere are many negative connotations associated with the phrase \"left-handed\": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A \"left-handed compliment\" is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In [[French language|French]], ''gauche'' means both \"left\" and \"awkward\" or \"clumsy\", while ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'' and related to \"adroit\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\". The name \"Dexter\" derives from the Latin for \"right\", as does the word \"dexterity\" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.\n\n[[Black magic]] is sometimes referred to as the \"[[left-hand path]]\".\n\nUntil very recently in [[Taiwan]] (and still in [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea|both North and South Korea]]), left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of [[stroke order]], developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the [[Latin alphabet]] might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward.<ref>[http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm Erste deutsche Beratungs- und Informationsstelle f\u00fcr Linksh\u00e4nder und umge-schulte Linksh\u00e4nder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922143207/http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm |date=2013-09-22 }}.
