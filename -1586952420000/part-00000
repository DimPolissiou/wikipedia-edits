The [[slope]] of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the function at the marked point.]]\n{{Calculus |differential}}\n\nThe '''derivative''' of a [[function of a real variable]] measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of [[calculus]].  For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to [[time]] is the object's [[velocity]]: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\n\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the [[slope]] of the [[Tangent|tangent line]] to the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]] at that point. The tangent line is the best [[linear approximation]] of the function near that input value.  For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\n\nDerivatives may be generalized to [[function of several real variables|functions of several real variables]]. In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a [[linear transformation]] whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The [[Jacobian matrix]] is the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables.  It can be calculated in terms of the [[partial derivative]]s with respect to the independent variables.  For a [[real-valued function]] of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the [[gradient vector]].\n\nThe process of finding a derivative is called '''differentiation'''. The reverse process is called ''[[antiderivative|antidifferentiation]]''.  The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relates antidifferentiation with [[integral|integration]]. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.{{#tag:ref|Differential calculus, as discussed in this article, is a very well established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources. See Apostol 1967, Apostol 1969, and Spivak 1994.|group=Note}}\n\n==Differentiation==\n''Differentiation'' is the action of computing a derivative. The derivative of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} of a variable {{math|''x''}} is a measure of the rate at which the value {{math|''y''}} of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable {{math|''x''}}. It is called the ''derivative'' of {{math|''f''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}}. If {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are [[real number]]s, and if the [[graph of a function|graph]] of {{math|''f''}} is plotted against {{math|''x''}}, the derivative is the [[slope]] of this graph at each point.\n\n[[File:Wiki slope in 2d.svg|right|thumb|250px|Slope of a linear function: <math>m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}</math>]]\nThe simplest case, apart from the trivial case of a [[constant function]], is when {{math|''y''}} is a [[linear function]] of {{math|''x''}}, meaning that the graph of {{math|''y''}} is a line. In this case, {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, for real numbers {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and the slope {{math|''m''}} is given by\n:<math>m=\\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x},</math>\nwhere the symbol {{math|\u0394}} ([[Delta (letter)|Delta]]) is an abbreviation for \"change in\", and  the combinations <math>\\Delta x</math> and <math>\\Delta y</math> refer to corresponding changes, i.e.: <math>\\Delta y = f(x + \\Delta x)- f(x)</math>. The above formula holds because\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ny + \\Delta y &= f\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right)\\\\\n  &= m\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right) +b =mx +m\\Delta x +b \\\\\n  &= y + m\\Delta x.\n\\end{align} </math>\nThus\n:<math> \\Delta y=m\\Delta x. </math>\n\nThis gives the value for the slope of a line.\n\nIf the function {{math|''f''}} is not linear (i.e. its graph is not a straight line), then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies over the considered range: differentiation is a method to find a unique value for this rate of change, not across a certain range <math>(\\Delta x),</math> but at any given value of {{math|''x''}}.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 250\n | header    = Rate of change as a limit value\n | image1    = Tangent-calculus.svg\n | caption1  = '''Figure 1'''.

Animated illustration: the tangent line (derivative) as the limit of secants\n }}\n\nThe idea, illustrated by Figures 1 to 3, is to compute the rate of change as the [[limit of a function|limit value]] of the [[difference quotient|ratio of the differences]] {{math|\u0394''y'' / \u0394''x''}} as {{math|\u0394''x''}} becomes infinitely small.\n\n===Notation===\n{{main|Notation for differentiation}}\nTwo distinct notations are commonly used for the derivative, one deriving from [[Leibniz]] and the other from [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]].\n\nIn [[Leibniz's notation]], an [[infinitesimal]] change in {{math|''x''}} is denoted by {{math|''dx''}}, and the derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} is written\n: <math> \\frac{dy}{dx} </math>\nsuggesting the ratio of two infinitesimal quantities.  (The above expression is read as \"the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x''\", \"''dy'' by ''dx''\", or \"''dy'' over ''dx''\". The oral form \"''dy'' ''dx''\" is often used conversationally, although it may lead to confusion.)\n\nIn [[Lagrange's notation]], the derivative with respect to {{math|''x''}} of a function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is denoted {{math|''f'''(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime of ''x''\") or {{math|''f<sub>x</sub>''\u2032(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime ''x'' of ''x''\"), in case of ambiguity of the variable implied by the differentiation. Lagrange's notation is sometimes incorrectly attributed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].\n\n===Rigorous definition===\n[[File:Tangent animation.gif|thumb|250px|A secant approaches a tangent when <math>\\Delta x \\to 0</math>.]]\nThe most common approach to turn this intuitive idea into a precise definition is to define the derivative as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of difference quotients of real numbers.<ref>Spivak 1994, chapter 10.</ref>  This is the approach described below.\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a real valued function defined in an [[open neighborhood]] of a real number {{math|''a''}}.  In classical geometry, the tangent line to the graph of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} was the unique line through the point {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} that did ''not'' meet the graph of {{math|''f''}} [[transversality (mathematics)|transversally]], meaning that the line did not pass straight through the graph.  The derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} at {{math|''a''}} is, geometrically, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  The slope of the tangent line is very close to the slope of the line through {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and a nearby point on the graph, for example {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  These lines are called [[secant line]]s.  A value of {{math|''h''}} close to zero gives a good approximation to the slope of the tangent line, and smaller values (in [[absolute value]]) of {{math|''h''}} will, in general, give better [[approximation]]s.  The slope {{math|''m''}} of the secant line is the difference between the {{math|''y''}} values of these points divided by the difference between the {{math|''x''}} values, that is, \n:<math>m = \\frac{\\Delta f(a)}{\\Delta a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{(a+h)-(a)} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nThis expression is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[difference quotient]].  Passing from an approximation to an exact answer is done using a [[limit of a function|limit]].  Geometrically, the limit of the secant lines is the tangent line.  Therefore, the limit of the difference quotient as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero, if it exists, should represent the slope of the tangent line to {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  This limit is defined to be the derivative of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}:\n\n:<math>f'(a)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nWhen the limit exists, {{math|''f''}} is said to be ''[[differentiable function|differentiable]]'' at {{math|''a''}}.  Here {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is one of several common notations for the derivative ([[Derivative#Notations for differentiation|see below]]). From this definition it is obvious that a differentiable function  {{Math|''f''}} is [[increasing]] if and only if its derivative is positive, and is decreasing [[If and only if|iff]] its derivative is negative. This fact is used extensively when analyzing function behavior, e.g. when finding [[Maxima and minima|local extrema]].\n\nEquivalently, the derivative satisfies the property that\n:<math>\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h) - (f(a) + f'(a)\\cdot h)}{h} = 0,</math>\nwhich has the intuitive interpretation (see Figure 1) that the tangent line to {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} gives the ''best [[linear]] approximation''\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h</math>\nto {{math|''f''}} near {{math|''a''}} (i.e., for small {{math|''h''}}). This interpretation is the easiest to generalize to other settings ([[Derivative#Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix|see below]]).\n\n[[Substitution property of equality|Substituting]] 0 for {{math|''h''}} in the difference quotient causes [[division by zero]], so the slope of the tangent line cannot be found directly using this method.  Instead, define {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to be the difference quotient as a function of {{math|''h''}}:\n\n:<math>Q(h) = \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\n{{math|''Q''(''h'')}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  If {{math|''f''}} is a [[continuous function]], meaning that its graph is an unbroken curve with no gaps, then {{math|''Q''}} is a continuous function away from {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  If the limit {{math|lim{{sub|''h''\u21920}}''Q''(''h'')}} exists, meaning that there is a way of choosing a value for {{math|''Q''(0)}} that makes {{math|''Q''}} a continuous function, then the function {{math|''f''}} is differentiable at {{math|''a''}}, and its derivative at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''Q''(0)}}.\n\nIn practice, the existence of a continuous extension of the difference quotient {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}} is shown by modifying the numerator to cancel {{math|''h''}} in the denominator. Such manipulations can make the limit value of {{math|''Q''}} for small {{math|''h''}} clear even though {{math|''Q''}} is still not defined at {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}. This process can be long and tedious for complicated functions, and many shortcuts are commonly used to simplify the process.\n\n===Definition over the hyperreals===\nRelative to a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension {{math|'''R''' \u2282 <sup>\u2217</sup>'''R'''}} of the real numbers, the derivative of a real function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} at a real point {{math|''x''}} can be defined as the [[shadow (mathematics)|shadow]] of the quotient {{math|{{sfrac|\u2206''y''|\u2206''x''}}}} for [[infinitesimal]] {{math|\u2206''x''}}, where {{math|\u2206''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'' + \u2206''x'') \u2212 ''f''(''x'')}}. Here the natural extension of {{math|''f''}} to the hyperreals is still denoted {{math|''f''}}. Here the derivative is said to exist if the shadow is independent of the infinitesimal chosen.\n\n===Example===\n[[File:Parabola2.svg|thumb|The square function]]\nThe square function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}}, and its derivative there is 6. This result is established by calculating the limit as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero of the difference quotient of {{math|''f''(3)}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf'(3) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(3+h)-f(3)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(3+h)^2 - 3^2}{h} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{6h + h^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe last expression shows that the difference quotient equals {{math|6 + ''h''}} when {{math|''h'' \u2260 0}} and is undefined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}, because of the definition of the difference quotient.  However, the definition of the limit says the difference quotient does not need to be defined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  The limit is the result of letting {{math|''h''}} go to zero, meaning it is the value that {{math|6 + ''h''}} tends to as {{math|''h''}} becomes very small:\n\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)} = 6 + 0 = 6. </math>\n\nHence the slope of the graph of the square function at the point {{math|(3, 9)}} is {{math|6}}, and so its derivative at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(3) {{=}} 6}}.\n\nMore generally, a similar computation shows that the derivative of the square function at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'') {{=}} 2''a''}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nf'(a) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(a+h)^2 - a^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^2 + 2ah + h^2 - a^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{2ah + h^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(2a + h)} = 2a\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Continuity and differentiability===\n\n[[File:Right-continuous.svg|thumb|right|This function does not have a derivative at the marked point, as the function is not continuous there (specifically, it has a [[jump discontinuity]]).]]\n\nIf {{math|''f''}} is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at {{math|''a''}}, then {{math|''f''}} must also be [[continuous function|continuous]] at {{math|''a''}}.  As an example, choose a point {{math|''a''}} and let {{math|''f''}} be the [[step function]] that returns the value 1 for all {{math|''x''}} less than {{math|''a''}}, and returns a different value 10 for all {{math|''x''}} greater than or equal to {{math|''a''}}.  {{math|''f''}} cannot have a derivative at {{math|''a''}}.  If {{math|''h''}} is negative, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is very steep, and as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero the slope tends to infinity.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} has slope zero.  Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist.{{#tag:ref|Despite this, it is still possible to take the derivative in the sense of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].  The result is nine times the [[Dirac measure]] centered at {{math|''a''}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}|group=Note}}\n\n[[File:Absolute value.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value function is continuous, but fails to be differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} since the tangent slopes do not approach the same value from the left as they do from the right.]]\n\nHowever, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there.  For example, the [[absolute value]] function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{abs|''x''}} }} is continuous at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, but it is not differentiable there.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is one, whereas if {{math|''h''}} is negative, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is negative one.  This can be seen graphically as a \"kink\" or a \"cusp\" in the graph at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.  Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its [[Vertical tangent|tangent is vertical]]: For instance, the function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>1/3</sup>}} is not differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nIn summary, a function that has a derivative is continuous, but there are continuous functions that do not have a derivative.\n\nMost functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at [[Almost everywhere|almost every]] point.  Early in the [[history of calculus]], many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points.  Under mild conditions, for example if the function is a [[monotone function]] or a [[Lipschitz function]], this is true.  However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.  This example is now known as the [[Weierstrass function]].  In 1931, [[Stefan Banach]] proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a [[meager set]] in the space of all continuous functions.<ref>{{Citation|author=Banach, S.|title=Uber die Baire'sche Kategorie gewisser Funktionenmengen|journal=Studia Math.|issue=3|year=1931|pages=174\u2013179|postscript=.|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:SkKdCEmUd6QJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,50&scillfp=3432975470163241186&oi=lle}}.

In this case, the derivative is equal to:<math>\\sin \\left(x^2\\right) + 2x^2 \\cos\\left(x^2\\right)</math>]]\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a function that has a derivative at every point in its [[domain of a function|domain]].  We can then define a function that maps every point <math>x</math> to the value of the derivative of <math>f</math> at <math>x</math>.  This function is written {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}} and is called the ''derivative function'' or the ''derivative of''  {{math|''f''}}.\n\nSometimes {{math|''f''}} has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain.  The function whose value at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} whenever {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of {{math|''f''}}.  It is still a function, but its domain is strictly smaller than the domain of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nUsing this idea, differentiation becomes a function of functions: The derivative is an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] whose domain is the set of all functions that have derivatives at every point of their domain and whose range is a set of functions.  If we denote this operator by {{math|''D''}}, then {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is the function {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}}.  Since {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is a function, it can be evaluated at a point {{math|''a''}}.  By the definition of the derivative function, {{math|''D''(''f'')(''a'') {{=}} ''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}}.\n\nFor comparison, consider the doubling function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}}; {{math|''f''}} is a real-valued function of a real number, meaning that it takes numbers as inputs and has numbers as outputs:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 1 &{}\\mapsto 2,\\\\\n 2 &{}\\mapsto 4,\\\\\n 3 &{}\\mapsto 6.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe operator {{math|''D''}}, however, is not defined on individual numbers.  It is only defined on functions:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n D(x \\mapsto 1) &= (x \\mapsto 0),\\\\\n D(x \\mapsto x) &= (x \\mapsto 1),\\\\\n D\\left(x \\mapsto x^2\\right) &= (x \\mapsto 2\\cdot x).\n\\end{align}</math>\nBecause the output of {{math|''D''}} is a function, the output of {{math|''D''}} can be evaluated at a point.  For instance, when {{math|''D''}} is applied to the square function, {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}, {{math|''D''}} outputs the doubling function {{math|''x'' \u21a6 2''x''}}, which we named {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. This output function can then be evaluated to get {{math|''f''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{math|''f''(2) {{=}} 4}}, and so on.\n\n==={{anchor|order of derivation}} Higher derivatives===\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a differentiable function, and let {{math|''f'' \u2032}} be its derivative. The derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2032}} (if it has one) is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[second derivative]] of {{math|f}}''.  Similarly, the derivative of the second derivative, if it exists, is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[third derivative]] of {{math|f}}''. Continuing this process, one can define, if it exists, the {{math|''n''}}th derivative as the derivative of the {{math|(''n''-1)}}th derivative. These repeated derivatives are called ''higher-order derivatives''. The {{math|''n''}}th derivative is also called the '''derivative of order {{math|''n''}}'''.\n\nIf {{math|''x''(''t'')}} represents the position of an object at time {{math|''t''}}, then the higher-order derivatives of {{math|''x''}} have specific interpretations in [[physics]]. The first derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the object's [[velocity]]. The second derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[acceleration]]. The third derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jerk (physics)|jerk]]. And finally, the fourth derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jounce]].\n\nA function {{math|''f''}} need not have a derivative (for example, if it is not continuous).  Similarly, even if {{math|''f''}} does have a derivative, it may not have a second derivative.  For example, let\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} +x^2, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -x^2, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\nCalculation shows that {{math|''f''}} is a differentiable function whose derivative at <math>x</math> is given by\n:<math>f'(x) = \\begin{cases} +2x, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -2x, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\n{{math|''f'''(''x'')}} is twice the absolute value function at <math>x</math>, and it does not have a derivative at zero. Similar examples show that a function can have a {{math|''k''}}th derivative for each non-negative integer {{math|''k''}} but not a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}th derivative.  A function that has {{math|''k''}} successive derivatives is called ''{{math|k}} times differentiable''.  If in addition the {{math|''k''}}th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of [[differentiability class]] {{math|''C<sup>k</sup>''}}.  (This is a stronger condition than having {{math|''k''}} derivatives, as shown by the second example of {{slink|Smoothness|Examples}}.)  A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called ''infinitely differentiable'' or ''[[smoothness|smooth]]''.\n\nOn the real line, every [[polynomial function]] is infinitely differentiable.  By standard [[differentiation rules]], if a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is differentiated {{math|''n''}} times, then it becomes a [[constant function]].  All of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero.  In particular, they exist, so polynomials are smooth functions.\n\nThe derivatives of a function {{math|''f''}} at a point {{math|''x''}} provide polynomial approximations to that function near {{math|''x''}}. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is twice differentiable, then\n:<math> f(x+h) \\approx f(x) + f'(x)h + \\tfrac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2</math>\nin the sense that\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x) - f'(x)h - \\frac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2}{h^2}=0.</math>\nIf {{math|''f''}} is infinitely differentiable, then this is the beginning of the [[Taylor series]] for {{math|''f''}} evaluated at {{math|''x'' + ''h''}} around {{math|''x''}}.\n\n===Inflection point===\n{{Main|Inflection point}}\n\nA point where the second derivative of a function changes sign is called an ''inflection point''.<ref>{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=\u00a74.18}}</ref> At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^3</math>, or it may fail to exist, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^\\frac{1}{3}</math>. At an inflection point, a function switches from being a [[convex function]] to being a [[concave function]] or vice versa.\n\n==Notation (details)==\n{{Main|Notation for differentiation}}\n\n===Leibniz's notation===\n{{Main|Leibniz's notation}}\n\nThe symbols <math>dx</math>, <math>dy</math>, and <math>\\frac{dy}{dx}</math> were introduced by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675.<ref>Manuscript of November 11, 1675 (Cajori vol. 2, page 204)</ref> It is still commonly used when the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} is viewed as a functional relationship between [[dependent and independent variables]].

A vector-valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions ''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ''y''<sub>2</sub>(''t''), ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''), meaning that {{nowrap|1='''y'''(''t'') = (''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''))}}.  This includes, for example, [[parametric curve]]s in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  The coordinate functions are real valued functions, so the above definition of derivative applies to them.  The derivative of '''y'''(''t'') is defined to be the [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], called the [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]], whose coordinates are the derivatives of the coordinate functions.  That is,\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t) = (y'_1(t), \\ldots, y'_n(t)).</math>\n\nEquivalently,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\mathbf{y}(t+h) - \\mathbf{y}(t)}{h},</math>\n\nif the limit exists.  The subtraction in the numerator is the subtraction of vectors, not scalars.

If we assume that the derivative of a vector-valued function retains the [[linearity of differentiation|linearity]] property, then the derivative of '''y'''(''t'') must be\n:<math>y'_1(t)\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\cdots + y'_n(t)\\mathbf{e}_n</math>\nbecause each of the basis vectors is a constant.\n\nThis generalization is useful, for example, if '''y'''(''t'') is the position vector of a particle at time ''t''; then the derivative '''y'''&prime;(''t'') is the [[velocity]] vector of the particle at time ''t''.\n\n===Partial derivatives===\n{{Main|Partial derivative}}\n\nSuppose that ''f'' is a function that depends on more than one variable\u2014for instance,\n:<math>f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\n''f'' can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables:\n:<math>f(x,y) = f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nIn other words, every value of ''x'' chooses a function, denoted ''f<sub>x</sub>'', which is a function of one real number.{{#tag:ref|This can also be expressed as the operation known as [[currying]].|group=Note}} That is,\n:<math>x \\mapsto f_x,</math>\n:<math>f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nOnce a value of ''x'' is chosen, say ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} determines a function ''f<sub>a</sub>'' that sends ''y'' to {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ay + ''y''<sup>2</sup>}}:\n:<math>f_a(y) = a^2 + ay + y^2.</math>\nIn this expression, ''a'' is a ''constant'', not a ''variable'', so ''f<sub>a</sub>'' is a function of only one real variable.  Consequently, the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies:\n:<math>f_a'(y) = a + 2y.</math>\nThe above procedure can be performed for any choice of ''a''.  Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function that describes the variation of ''f'' in the ''y'' direction:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y) = x + 2y.</math>\nThis is the partial derivative of ''f'' with respect to ''y''.

This expression also shows that the computation of partial derivatives reduces to the computation of one-variable derivatives.\n\nAn important example of a function of several variables is the case of a [[scalar-valued function]] {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} on a domain in Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> (e.g., on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>). In this case ''f'' has a partial derivative \u2202''f''/\u2202''x''<sub>''j''</sub> with respect to each variable ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>. At the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>), these partial derivatives define the vector\n:<math>\\nabla f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n), \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)\\right).</math>\nThis vector is called the '''[[gradient]]''' of ''f'' at ''a''.  If ''f'' is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function \u2207''f'' that takes the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) to the vector \u2207''f''(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>).  Consequently, the gradient determines a [[vector field]].\n\n===Directional derivatives===\n{{Main|Directional derivative}}\n\nIf ''f'' is a real-valued function on '''R'''<sup>n</sup>, then the partial derivatives of ''f'' measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes.  For example, if ''f'' is a function of ''x'' and ''y'', then its partial derivatives measure the variation in ''f'' in the ''x'' direction and the ''y'' direction.  They do not, however, directly measure the variation of ''f'' in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}.  These are measured using directional derivatives.  Choose a vector\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1,\\ldots,v_n).</math>\nThe '''directional derivative''' of ''f'' in the direction of '''v''' at the point '''x''' is the limit\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}{\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + h\\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{h}}.</math>\nIn some cases it may be easier to compute or estimate the directional derivative after changing the length of the vector.  Often this is done to turn the problem into the computation of a directional derivative in the direction of a unit vector.  To see how this works, suppose that {{nowrap|1='''v''' = ''\u03bb'''''u'''}}.  Substitute {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''k''/''\u03bb''}} into the difference quotient.  The difference quotient becomes:\n:<math>\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + (k/\\lambda)(\\lambda\\mathbf{u})) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k/\\lambda}\n= \\lambda\\cdot\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + k\\mathbf{u}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k}.</math>\nThis is ''\u03bb'' times the difference quotient for the directional derivative of ''f'' with respect to '''u'''. Furthermore, taking the limit as ''h'' tends to zero is the same as taking the limit as ''k'' tends to zero because ''h'' and ''k'' are multiples of each other.  Therefore, {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') = \u03bb''D''<sub>'''u'''</sub>(''f'')}}.  Because of this rescaling property, directional derivatives are frequently considered only for unit vectors.\n\nIf all the partial derivatives of ''f'' exist and are continuous at '''x''', then they determine the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v''' by the formula:\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{j=1}^n v_j \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}.</math>\nThis is a consequence of the definition of the [[total derivative]].  It follows that the directional derivative is [[linear map|linear]] in '''v''', meaning that {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v''' + '''w'''</sub>(''f'') = ''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') + ''D''<sub>'''w'''</sub>(''f'')}}.\n\nThe same definition also works when ''f'' is a function with values in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. The above definition is applied to each component of the vectors.  In this case, the directional derivative is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.\n\n===Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix===\n{{Main|Total derivative}}\n\nWhen ''f'' is a function from an open subset of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, then the directional derivative of ''f'' in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at that point and in that direction.  But when {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}}, no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of ''f''. The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once.  That is, for any vector '''v''' starting at '''a''', the linear approximation formula holds:\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nJust like the single-variable derivative, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;&prime;('''a''')}} is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible.\n\nIf ''n'' and ''m'' are both one, then the derivative {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} is a number and the expression {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''v''}} is the product of two numbers. But in higher dimensions, it is impossible for {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} to be a number. If it were a number, then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} would be a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> while the other terms would be vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and therefore the formula would not make sense. For the linear approximation formula to make sense, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a function that sends vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} must denote this function evaluated at '''v'''.\n\nTo determine what kind of function it is, notice that the linear approximation formula can be rewritten as\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a}) \\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nNotice that if we choose another vector '''w''', then this approximate equation determines another approximate equation by substituting '''w''' for '''v'''. It determines a third approximate equation by substituting both '''w''' for '''v''' and {{nowrap|'''a''' + '''v'''}} for '''a'''. By subtracting these two new equations, we get\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a})\n\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{w} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.</math>\nIf we assume that '''v''' is small and that the derivative varies continuously in '''a''', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''' + '''v''')}} is approximately equal to {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}}, and therefore the right-hand side is approximately zero. The left-hand side can be rewritten in a different way using the linear approximation formula with {{nowrap|'''v''' + '''w'''}} substituted for '''v'''. The linear approximation formula implies:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n0\n&\\approx f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a}) \\\\\n&= (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) \\\\\n&\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis suggests that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a [[linear transformation]] from the vector space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to the vector space '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. In fact, it is possible to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations.  Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times ||'''v'''||, where the constant is independent of '''v''' but depends continuously on '''a'''. Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities.  In particular, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a linear transformation up to a small error term.  In the limit as '''v''' and '''w''' tend to zero, it must therefore be a linear transformation. Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as '''v''' goes to zero, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a linear transformation.\n\nIn one variable, the fact that the derivative is the best linear approximation is expressed by the fact that it is the limit of difference quotients.  However, the usual difference quotient does not make sense in higher dimensions because it is not usually possible to divide vectors. In particular, the numerator and denominator of the difference quotient are not even in the same vector space: The numerator lies in the codomain '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> while the denominator lies in the domain '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. Furthermore, the derivative is a linear transformation, a different type of object from both the numerator and denominator.  To make precise the idea that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is the best linear approximation, it is necessary to adapt a different formula for the one-variable derivative in which these problems disappear. If {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}}, then the usual definition of the derivative may be manipulated to show that the derivative of ''f'' at ''a'' is the unique number {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)}{h} = 0.</math>\nThis is equivalent to\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)|}{|h|} = 0</math>\nbecause the limit of a function tends to zero if and only if the limit of the absolute value of the function tends to zero.  This last formula can be adapted to the many-variable situation by replacing the absolute values with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s.\n\nThe definition of the '''total derivative''' of ''f'' at '''a''', therefore, is that it is the unique linear transformation {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''') : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{\\mathbf{h}\\to 0} \\frac{\\lVert f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{h}) - (f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{h})\\rVert}{\\lVert\\mathbf{h}\\rVert} = 0.</math>\nHere '''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  However, ''f''\u2032('''a''')'''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.  If ''v'' is a vector starting at ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is called the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of '''v''' by ''f'' and is sometimes written {{nowrap|''f''<sub>\u2217</sub>'''v'''}}.\n\nIf the total derivative exists at '''a''', then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of ''f'' exist at '''a''', and for all '''v''', {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v'''.  If we write ''f'' using coordinate functions, so that {{nowrap|1=''f'' = (''f''<sub>1</sub>, ''f''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''m''</sub>)}}, then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  This matrix is called the '''[[Jacobian matrix]]''' of ''f'' at '''a''':\n\n:<math>f'(\\mathbf{a}) = \\operatorname{Jac}_{\\mathbf{a}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}\\right)_{ij}.</math>\n\nThe existence of the total derivative ''f''\u2032('''a''') is strictly stronger than the existence of all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends continuously on '''a'''.\n\nThe definition of the total derivative subsumes the definition of the derivative in one variable.  That is, if ''f'' is a real-valued function of a real variable, then the total derivative exists if and only if the usual derivative exists.  The Jacobian matrix reduces to a 1\u00d71 matrix whose only entry is the derivative ''f''&prime;(''x'').  This 1\u00d71 matrix satisfies the property that {{nowrap|''f''(''a'' + ''h'') \u2212 (''f''(''a'') + ''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''h'')}} is approximately zero, in other words that\n\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h.</math>\n\nUp to changing variables, this is the statement that the function <math>x \\mapsto f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</math> is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at ''a''.\n\nThe total derivative of a function does not give another function in the same way as the one-variable case.  This is because the total derivative of a multivariable function has to record much more information than the derivative of a single-variable function.  Instead, the total derivative gives a function from the [[tangent bundle]] of the source to the tangent bundle of the target.\n\nThe natural analog of second, third, and higher-order total derivatives is not a linear transformation, is not a function on the tangent bundle, and is not built by repeatedly taking the total derivative. The analog of a higher-order derivative, called a [[jet (mathematics)|jet]], cannot be a linear transformation because higher-order derivatives reflect subtle geometric information, such as concavity, which cannot be described in terms of linear data such as vectors.  It cannot be a function on the tangent bundle because the tangent bundle only has room for the base space and the directional derivatives. Because jets capture higher-order information, they take as arguments additional coordinates representing higher-order changes in direction. The space determined by these additional coordinates is called the [[jet bundle]].  The relation between the total derivative and the partial derivatives of a function is paralleled in the relation between the ''k''th order jet of a function and its partial derivatives of order less than or equal to ''k''.\n\nBy repeatedly taking the total derivative, one obtains higher versions of the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]], specialized to '''R'''<sup>''p''</sup>. The ''k''th order total derivative may be interpreted as a map\n:<math>D^k f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to L^k(\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{R}^n, \\mathbb{R}^m)</math>\nwhich takes a point '''x''' in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and assigns to it an element of the space of ''k''-linear maps from '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> \u2013 the \"best\" (in a certain precise sense) ''k''-linear approximation to ''f'' at that point. By precomposing it with the [[Diagonal functor|diagonal map]] \u0394, {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2192 ('''x''', '''x''')}}, a generalized Taylor series may be begun as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n f(\\mathbf{x}) & \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x-a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\Delta(\\mathbf{x-a})) + \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x - a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\mathbf{x - a}, \\mathbf{x - a})+ \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + \\sum_i (D f)_i (x_i-a_i) + \\sum_{j, k} \\left(D^2 f\\right)_{j k} (x_j-a_j) (x_k-a_k) + \\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere f('''a''') is identified with a constant function, {{nowrap|''x''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2212 ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are the components of the vector {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2212 '''a'''}}, and {{nowrap|(''Df'')<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{nowrap|(''D''<sup>2</sup>''f'')<sub>''jk''</sub>}} are the components of {{nowrap|''Df''}} and {{nowrap|''D''<sup>2</sup>''f''}} as linear transformations.\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{Main|Derivative (generalizations)}}\n\nThe concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a [[linear approximation]] of the function at that point.\n* An important generalization of the derivative concerns [[complex function]]s of [[Complex number|complex variable]]s, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers '''C''' to '''C'''. The notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If '''C''' is identified with '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by writing a complex number ''z'' as {{nowrap|''x'' + ''iy''}}, then a differentiable function from '''C''' to '''C''' is certainly differentiable as a function from '''R'''<sup>2</sup> to '''R'''<sup>2</sup> (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is ''complex linear'' and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]] \u2013 see [[holomorphic function]]s.\n* Another generalization concerns functions between [[smooth manifold|differentiable or smooth manifolds]]. Intuitively speaking such a manifold ''M'' is a space that can be approximated near each point ''x'' by a vector space called its [[tangent space]]: the prototypical example is a [[smooth surface]] in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. The derivative (or differential) of a (differentiable) map {{nowrap|''f'': ''M'' \u2192 ''N''}} between manifolds, at a point ''x'' in ''M'', is then a [[linear map]] from the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'' to the tangent space of ''N'' at ''f''(''x''). The derivative function becomes a map between the [[tangent bundle]]s of ''M'' and ''N''. This definition is fundamental in [[differential geometry]] and has many uses \u2013 see [[pushforward (differential)]] and [[pullback (differential geometry)]].\n* Differentiation can also be defined for maps between [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite dimensional]] [[vector space]]s such as [[Banach space]]s and [[Fr\u00e9chet space]]s.  There is a generalization both of the directional derivative, called the [[Gateaux derivative]], and of the differential, called the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]].\n* One deficiency of the classical derivative is that very many functions are not differentiable. Nevertheless, there is a way of extending the notion of the derivative so that all [[continuous function|continuous]] functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the [[weak derivative]]. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] and only require that a function is differentiable \"on average\".\n* The properties of the derivative have inspired the introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology \u2014 see, for example, [[differential algebra]].\n* The discrete equivalent of differentiation is [[finite difference]]s. The study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of finite differences in [[time scale calculus]].\n* Also see [[arithmetic derivative]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of calculus}}\n[[Calculus]], known in its early history as ''infinitesimal calculus'', is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline focused on [[limit (mathematics)|limits]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], derivatives, [[integral]]s, and [[infinite series]]. [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] independently discovered calculus in the mid-17th century. However, each inventor claimed the other stole his work in a [[Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy|bitter dispute]] that continued until the end of their lives.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Differential calculus#Applications of derivatives|Applications of derivatives]]\n* [[Automatic differentiation]]\n* [[Differentiability class]]\n* [[Differentiation rules]]\n* [[Differintegral]]\n* [[Fractal derivative]]\n* [[Generalizations of the derivative]]\n* [[Hasse derivative]]\n* [[History of calculus]]\n* [[Integral]]\n* [[Infinitesimal]]\n* [[Linearization]]\n* [[Mathematical analysis]]\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]\n* [[Numerical differentiation]]\n* [[Rate (mathematics)]]\n* [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem]]\n* [[Symmetric derivative]]\n* [[Schwarzian derivative]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Print===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Anton\n | first = Howard\n | last2 = Bivens\n | first2 = Irl\n | last3 = Davis\n | first3 = Stephen\n | date = February 2, 2005\n | title = Calculus: Early Transcendentals Single and Multivariable\n | place = New York\n | publisher = Wiley\n | edition = 8th\n | isbn  = 978-0-471-47244-5\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Apostol\n | first = Tom M.\n | author-link = Tom M.

The [[slope]] of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the function at the marked point.]]\n{{Calculus |differential}}\n\nThe '''derivative''' of a [[function of a real variable]] measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of [[calculus]].  For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to [[time]] is the object's [[velocity]]: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\n\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the [[slope]] of the [[Tangent|tangent line]] to the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]] at that point. The tangent line is the best [[linear approximation]] of the function near that input value.  For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\n\nDerivatives may be generalized to [[function of several real variables|functions of several real variables]]. In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a [[linear transformation]] whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The [[Jacobian matrix]] is the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables.  It can be calculated in terms of the [[partial derivative]]s with respect to the independent variables.  For a [[real-valued function]] of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the [[gradient vector]].\n\nThe process of finding a derivative is called '''differentiation'''. The reverse process is called ''[[antiderivative|antidifferentiation]]''.  The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relates antidifferentiation with [[integral|integration]]. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.{{#tag:ref|Differential calculus, as discussed in this article, is a very well established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources. See Apostol 1967, Apostol 1969, and Spivak 1994.|group=Note}}\n\n==Differentiation==\n''Differentiation'' is the action of computing a derivative. The derivative of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} of a variable {{math|''x''}} is a measure of the rate at which the value {{math|''y''}} of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable {{math|''x''}}. It is called the ''derivative'' of {{math|''f''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}}. If {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are [[real number]]s, and if the [[graph of a function|graph]] of {{math|''f''}} is plotted against {{math|''x''}}, the derivative is the [[slope]] of this graph at each point.\n\n[[File:Wiki slope in 2d.svg|right|thumb|250px|Slope of a linear function: <math>m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}</math>]]\nThe simplest case, apart from the trivial case of a [[constant function]], is when {{math|''y''}} is a [[linear function]] of {{math|''x''}}, meaning that the graph of {{math|''y''}} is a line. In this case, {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, for real numbers {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and the slope {{math|''m''}} is given by\n:<math>m=\\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x},</math>\nwhere the symbol {{math|\u0394}} ([[Delta (letter)|Delta]]) is an abbreviation for \"change in\", and  the combinations <math>\\Delta x</math> and <math>\\Delta y</math> refer to corresponding changes, i.e.: <math>\\Delta y = f(x + \\Delta x)- f(x)</math>. The above formula holds because\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ny + \\Delta y &= f\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right)\\\\\n  &= m\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right) +b =mx +m\\Delta x +b \\\\\n  &= y + m\\Delta x.\n\\end{align} </math>\nThus\n:<math> \\Delta y=m\\Delta x. </math>\n\nThis gives the value for the slope of a line.\n\nIf the function {{math|''f''}} is not linear (i.e. its graph is not a straight line), then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies over the considered range: differentiation is a method to find a unique value for this rate of change, not across a certain range <math>(\\Delta x),</math> but at any given value of {{math|''x''}}.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 250\n | header    = Rate of change as a limit value\n | image1    = Tangent-calculus.svg\n | caption1  = '''Figure 1'''.

(The above expression is read as \"the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x''\", \"''dy'' by ''dx''\", or \"''dy'' over ''dx''\". The oral form \"''dy'' ''dx''\" is often used conversationally, although it may lead to confusion.)\n\nIn [[Lagrange's notation]], the derivative with respect to {{math|''x''}} of a function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is denoted {{math|''f'''(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime of ''x''\") or {{math|''f<sub>x</sub>''\u2032(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime ''x'' of ''x''\"), in case of ambiguity of the variable implied by the differentiation. Lagrange's notation is sometimes incorrectly attributed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].\n\n===Rigorous definition===\n[[File:Tangent animation.gif|thumb|250px|A secant approaches a tangent when <math>\\Delta x \\to 0</math>.]]\nThe most common approach to turn this intuitive idea into a precise definition is to define the derivative as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of difference quotients of real numbers.<ref>Spivak 1994, chapter 10.</ref>  This is the approach described below.\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a real valued function defined in an [[open neighborhood]] of a real number {{math|''a''}}.  In classical geometry, the tangent line to the graph of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} was the unique line through the point {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} that did ''not'' meet the graph of {{math|''f''}} [[transversality (mathematics)|transversally]], meaning that the line did not pass straight through the graph.  The derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} at {{math|''a''}} is, geometrically, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  The slope of the tangent line is very close to the slope of the line through {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and a nearby point on the graph, for example {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  These lines are called [[secant line]]s.  A value of {{math|''h''}} close to zero gives a good approximation to the slope of the tangent line, and smaller values (in [[absolute value]]) of {{math|''h''}} will, in general, give better [[approximation]]s.  The slope {{math|''m''}} of the secant line is the difference between the {{math|''y''}} values of these points divided by the difference between the {{math|''x''}} values, that is, \n:<math>m = \\frac{\\Delta f(a)}{\\Delta a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{(a+h)-(a)} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nThis expression is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[difference quotient]].  Passing from an approximation to an exact answer is done using a [[limit of a function|limit]].  Geometrically, the limit of the secant lines is the tangent line.  Therefore, the limit of the difference quotient as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero, if it exists, should represent the slope of the tangent line to {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  This limit is defined to be the derivative of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}:\n\n:<math>f'(a)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nWhen the limit exists, {{math|''f''}} is said to be ''[[differentiable function|differentiable]]'' at {{math|''a''}}.  Here {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is one of several common notations for the derivative ([[Derivative#Notations for differentiation|see below]]). From this definition it is obvious that a differentiable function  {{Math|''f''}} is [[increasing]] if and only if its derivative is positive, and is decreasing [[If and only if|iff]] its derivative is negative. This fact is used extensively when analyzing function behavior, e.g. when finding [[Maxima and minima|local extrema]].\n\nEquivalently, the derivative satisfies the property that\n:<math>\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h) - (f(a) + f'(a)\\cdot h)}{h} = 0,</math>\nwhich has the intuitive interpretation (see Figure 1) that the tangent line to {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} gives the ''best [[linear]] approximation''\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h</math>\nto {{math|''f''}} near {{math|''a''}} (i.e., for small {{math|''h''}}). This interpretation is the easiest to generalize to other settings ([[Derivative#Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix|see below]]).\n\n[[Substitution property of equality|Substituting]] 0 for {{math|''h''}} in the difference quotient causes [[division by zero]], so the slope of the tangent line cannot be found directly using this method.  Instead, define {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to be the difference quotient as a function of {{math|''h''}}:\n\n:<math>Q(h) = \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\n{{math|''Q''(''h'')}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  If {{math|''f''}} is a [[continuous function]], meaning that its graph is an unbroken curve with no gaps, then {{math|''Q''}} is a continuous function away from {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  If the limit {{math|lim{{sub|''h''\u21920}}''Q''(''h'')}} exists, meaning that there is a way of choosing a value for {{math|''Q''(0)}} that makes {{math|''Q''}} a continuous function, then the function {{math|''f''}} is differentiable at {{math|''a''}}, and its derivative at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''Q''(0)}}.\n\nIn practice, the existence of a continuous extension of the difference quotient {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}} is shown by modifying the numerator to cancel {{math|''h''}} in the denominator. Such manipulations can make the limit value of {{math|''Q''}} for small {{math|''h''}} clear even though {{math|''Q''}} is still not defined at {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}. This process can be long and tedious for complicated functions, and many shortcuts are commonly used to simplify the process.\n\n===Definition over the hyperreals===\nRelative to a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension {{math|'''R''' \u2282 <sup>\u2217</sup>'''R'''}} of the real numbers, the derivative of a real function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} at a real point {{math|''x''}} can be defined as the [[shadow (mathematics)|shadow]] of the quotient {{math|{{sfrac|\u2206''y''|\u2206''x''}}}} for [[infinitesimal]] {{math|\u2206''x''}}, where {{math|\u2206''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'' + \u2206''x'') \u2212 ''f''(''x'')}}. Here the natural extension of {{math|''f''}} to the hyperreals is still denoted {{math|''f''}}. Here the derivative is said to exist if the shadow is independent of the infinitesimal chosen.\n\n===Example===\n[[File:Parabola2.svg|thumb|The square function]]\nThe square function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}}, and its derivative there is 6. This result is established by calculating the limit as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero of the difference quotient of {{math|''f''(3)}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf'(3) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(3+h)-f(3)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(3+h)^2 - 3^2}{h} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{6h + h^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe last expression shows that the difference quotient equals {{math|6 + ''h''}} when {{math|''h'' \u2260 0}} and is undefined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}, because of the definition of the difference quotient.  However, the definition of the limit says the difference quotient does not need to be defined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  The limit is the result of letting {{math|''h''}} go to zero, meaning it is the value that {{math|6 + ''h''}} tends to as {{math|''h''}} becomes very small:\n\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)} = 6 + 0 = 6. </math>\n\nHence the slope of the graph of the square function at the point {{math|(3, 9)}} is {{math|6}}, and so its derivative at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(3) {{=}} 6}}.\n\nMore generally, a similar computation shows that the derivative of the square function at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'') {{=}} 2''a''}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nf'(a) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(a+h)^2 - a^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^2 + 2ah + h^2 - a^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{2ah + h^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(2a + h)} = 2a\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Continuity and differentiability===\n\n[[File:Right-continuous.svg|thumb|right|This function does not have a derivative at the marked point, as the function is not continuous there (specifically, it has a [[jump discontinuity]]).]]\n\nIf {{math|''f''}} is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at {{math|''a''}}, then {{math|''f''}} must also be [[continuous function|continuous]] at {{math|''a''}}.  As an example, choose a point {{math|''a''}} and let {{math|''f''}} be the [[step function]] that returns the value 1 for all {{math|''x''}} less than {{math|''a''}}, and returns a different value 10 for all {{math|''x''}} greater than or equal to {{math|''a''}}.  {{math|''f''}} cannot have a derivative at {{math|''a''}}.  If {{math|''h''}} is negative, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is very steep, and as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero the slope tends to infinity.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} has slope zero.  Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist.{{#tag:ref|Despite this, it is still possible to take the derivative in the sense of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].  The result is nine times the [[Dirac measure]] centered at {{math|''a''}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}|group=Note}}\n\n[[File:Absolute value.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value function is continuous, but fails to be differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} since the tangent slopes do not approach the same value from the left as they do from the right.]]\n\nHowever, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there.  For example, the [[absolute value]] function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{abs|''x''}} }} is continuous at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, but it is not differentiable there.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is one, whereas if {{math|''h''}} is negative, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is negative one.  This can be seen graphically as a \"kink\" or a \"cusp\" in the graph at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.  Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its [[Vertical tangent|tangent is vertical]]: For instance, the function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>1/3</sup>}} is not differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nIn summary, a function that has a derivative is continuous, but there are continuous functions that do not have a derivative.\n\nMost functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at [[Almost everywhere|almost every]] point.  Early in the [[history of calculus]], many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points.  Under mild conditions, for example if the function is a [[monotone function]] or a [[Lipschitz function]], this is true.  However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.  This example is now known as the [[Weierstrass function]].  In 1931, [[Stefan Banach]] proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a [[meager set]] in the space of all continuous functions.<ref>{{Citation|author=Banach, S.|title=Uber die Baire'sche Kategorie gewisser Funktionenmengen|journal=Studia Math.|issue=3|year=1931|pages=174\u2013179|postscript=.|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:SkKdCEmUd6QJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,50&scillfp=3432975470163241186&oi=lle}}.

In this case, the derivative is equal to:<math>\\sin \\left(x^2\\right) + 2x^2 \\cos\\left(x^2\\right)</math>]]\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a function that has a derivative at every point in its [[domain of a function|domain]].  We can then define a function that maps every point <math>x</math> to the value of the derivative of <math>f</math> at <math>x</math>.  This function is written {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}} and is called the ''derivative function'' or the ''derivative of''  {{math|''f''}}.\n\nSometimes {{math|''f''}} has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain.  The function whose value at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} whenever {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of {{math|''f''}}.  It is still a function, but its domain is strictly smaller than the domain of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nUsing this idea, differentiation becomes a function of functions: The derivative is an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] whose domain is the set of all functions that have derivatives at every point of their domain and whose range is a set of functions.  If we denote this operator by {{math|''D''}}, then {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is the function {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}}.  Since {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is a function, it can be evaluated at a point {{math|''a''}}.  By the definition of the derivative function, {{math|''D''(''f'')(''a'') {{=}} ''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}}.\n\nFor comparison, consider the doubling function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}}; {{math|''f''}} is a real-valued function of a real number, meaning that it takes numbers as inputs and has numbers as outputs:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 1 &{}\\mapsto 2,\\\\\n 2 &{}\\mapsto 4,\\\\\n 3 &{}\\mapsto 6.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe operator {{math|''D''}}, however, is not defined on individual numbers.  It is only defined on functions:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n D(x \\mapsto 1) &= (x \\mapsto 0),\\\\\n D(x \\mapsto x) &= (x \\mapsto 1),\\\\\n D\\left(x \\mapsto x^2\\right) &= (x \\mapsto 2\\cdot x).\n\\end{align}</math>\nBecause the output of {{math|''D''}} is a function, the output of {{math|''D''}} can be evaluated at a point.  For instance, when {{math|''D''}} is applied to the square function, {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}, {{math|''D''}} outputs the doubling function {{math|''x'' \u21a6 2''x''}}, which we named {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. This output function can then be evaluated to get {{math|''f''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{math|''f''(2) {{=}} 4}}, and so on.\n\n==={{anchor|order of derivation}} Higher derivatives===\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a differentiable function, and let {{math|''f'' \u2032}} be its derivative. The derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2032}} (if it has one) is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[second derivative]] of {{math|f}}''.  Similarly, the derivative of the second derivative, if it exists, is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[third derivative]] of {{math|f}}''. Continuing this process, one can define, if it exists, the {{math|''n''}}th derivative as the derivative of the {{math|(''n''-1)}}th derivative. These repeated derivatives are called ''higher-order derivatives''. The {{math|''n''}}th derivative is also called the '''derivative of order {{math|''n''}}'''.\n\nIf {{math|''x''(''t'')}} represents the position of an object at time {{math|''t''}}, then the higher-order derivatives of {{math|''x''}} have specific interpretations in [[physics]]. The first derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the object's [[velocity]]. The second derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[acceleration]]. The third derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jerk (physics)|jerk]]. And finally, the fourth derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the [[jounce]].\n\nA function {{math|''f''}} need not have a derivative (for example, if it is not continuous).  Similarly, even if {{math|''f''}} does have a derivative, it may not have a second derivative.  For example, let\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} +x^2, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -x^2, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\nCalculation shows that {{math|''f''}} is a differentiable function whose derivative at <math>x</math> is given by\n:<math>f'(x) = \\begin{cases} +2x, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -2x, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\n{{math|''f'''(''x'')}} is twice the absolute value function at <math>x</math>, and it does not have a derivative at zero. Similar examples show that a function can have a {{math|''k''}}th derivative for each non-negative integer {{math|''k''}} but not a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}th derivative.  A function that has {{math|''k''}} successive derivatives is called ''{{math|k}} times differentiable''.  If in addition the {{math|''k''}}th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of [[differentiability class]] {{math|''C<sup>k</sup>''}}.  (This is a stronger condition than having {{math|''k''}} derivatives, as shown by the second example of {{slink|Smoothness|Examples}}.)  A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called ''infinitely differentiable'' or ''[[smoothness|smooth]]''.\n\nOn the real line, every [[polynomial function]] is infinitely differentiable.  By standard [[differentiation rules]], if a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is differentiated {{math|''n''}} times, then it becomes a [[constant function]].  All of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero.  In particular, they exist, so polynomials are smooth functions.\n\nThe derivatives of a function {{math|''f''}} at a point {{math|''x''}} provide polynomial approximations to that function near {{math|''x''}}. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is twice differentiable, then\n:<math> f(x+h) \\approx f(x) + f'(x)h + \\tfrac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2</math>\nin the sense that\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x) - f'(x)h - \\frac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2}{h^2}=0.</math>\nIf {{math|''f''}} is infinitely differentiable, then this is the beginning of the [[Taylor series]] for {{math|''f''}} evaluated at {{math|''x'' + ''h''}} around {{math|''x''}}.\n\n===Inflection point===\n{{Main|Inflection point}}\n\nA point where the second derivative of a function changes sign is called an ''inflection point''.<ref>{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=\u00a74.18}}</ref> At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^3</math>, or it may fail to exist, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^\\frac{1}{3}</math>. At an inflection point, a function switches from being a [[convex function]] to being a [[concave function]] or vice versa.\n\n==Notation (details)==\n{{Main|Notation for differentiation}}\n\n===Leibniz's notation===\n{{Main|Leibniz's notation}}\n\nThe symbols <math>dx</math>, <math>dy</math>, and <math>\\frac{dy}{dx}</math> were introduced by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675.<ref>Manuscript of November 11, 1675 (Cajori vol. 2, page 204)</ref> It is still commonly used when the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} is viewed as a functional relationship between [[dependent and independent variables]]. Then the first derivative is denoted by\n\n: <math>\\frac{dy}{dx},\\quad\\frac{d f}{dx}, \\text{  or  }\\frac{d}{dx}f,</math>\n\nand was once thought of as an [[infinitesimal]] quotient.  Higher derivatives are expressed using the notation\n\n<!-- In the following formula, the function is a lower-case f, not an upper case F.

These are abbreviations for multiple applications of the derivative operator. For example,\n:<math>\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right).</math>\n\nWith Leibniz's notation, we can write the derivative of <math>y</math> at the point <math>x = a</math> in two different ways:\n\n: <math>\\left.\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right|_{x=a} = \\frac{dy}{dx}(a).</math>\n\nLeibniz's notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator), which is relevant in [[partial derivative|partial differentiation]].  It also makes the [[chain rule]] easier to remember:{{#tag:ref|In the formulation of calculus in terms of limits, the ''du'' symbol has been assigned various meanings by various authors.  Some authors do not assign a meaning to ''du'' by itself, but only as part of the symbol ''du''/''dx''.

The ''n''th derivative is denoted <math>D^nf</math>.\n\nIf {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} is a dependent variable, then often the subscript ''x'' is attached to the ''D'' to clarify the independent variable ''x''.\nEuler's notation is then written\n:<math>D_x y</math> &emsp; or &emsp; <math>D_x f(x)</math>,\nalthough this subscript is often omitted when the variable ''x'' is understood, for instance when this is the only independent variable present in the expression.\n\nEuler's notation is useful for stating and solving [[linear differential equation]]s.\n\n==Rules of computation==\n{{Main|Differentiation rules}}\nThe derivative of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition by considering the difference quotient, and computing its limit. In practice, once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using ''rules'' for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones.\n\n===Rules for basic functions===\nMost derivative computations eventually require taking the derivative of some common functions.

The known derivatives of the elementary functions ''x''<sup>2</sup>, ''x''<sup>4</sup>, sin(''x''), ln(''x'') and {{nowrap|1=exp(''x'') = ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}, as well as the constant 7, were also used.\n\n==In higher dimensions==\n{{See also|Vector calculus|Multivariable calculus}}\n\n===Vector-valued functions===\nA [[vector-valued function]] '''y''' of a real variable sends real numbers to vectors in some [[vector space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  A vector-valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions ''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ''y''<sub>2</sub>(''t''), ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''), meaning that {{nowrap|1='''y'''(''t'') = (''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''))}}.  This includes, for example, [[parametric curve]]s in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  The coordinate functions are real valued functions, so the above definition of derivative applies to them.  The derivative of '''y'''(''t'') is defined to be the [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], called the [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]], whose coordinates are the derivatives of the coordinate functions.  That is,\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t) = (y'_1(t), \\ldots, y'_n(t)).</math>\n\nEquivalently,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\mathbf{y}(t+h) - \\mathbf{y}(t)}{h},</math>\n\nif the limit exists.  The subtraction in the numerator is the subtraction of vectors, not scalars.  If the derivative of '''y''' exists for every value of ''t'', then '''y'''\u2032 is another vector-valued function.\n\nIf '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''e'''<sub>''n''</sub> is the standard basis for '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, then '''y'''(''t'') can also be written as {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>1</sub> + \u2026 + ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>}}. If we assume that the derivative of a vector-valued function retains the [[linearity of differentiation|linearity]] property, then the derivative of '''y'''(''t'') must be\n:<math>y'_1(t)\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\cdots + y'_n(t)\\mathbf{e}_n</math>\nbecause each of the basis vectors is a constant.\n\nThis generalization is useful, for example, if '''y'''(''t'') is the position vector of a particle at time ''t''; then the derivative '''y'''&prime;(''t'') is the [[velocity]] vector of the particle at time ''t''.\n\n===Partial derivatives===\n{{Main|Partial derivative}}\n\nSuppose that ''f'' is a function that depends on more than one variable\u2014for instance,\n:<math>f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\n''f'' can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables:\n:<math>f(x,y) = f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nIn other words, every value of ''x'' chooses a function, denoted ''f<sub>x</sub>'', which is a function of one real number.{{#tag:ref|This can also be expressed as the operation known as [[currying]].|group=Note}} That is,\n:<math>x \\mapsto f_x,</math>\n:<math>f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nOnce a value of ''x'' is chosen, say ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} determines a function ''f<sub>a</sub>'' that sends ''y'' to {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ay + ''y''<sup>2</sup>}}:\n:<math>f_a(y) = a^2 + ay + y^2.</math>\nIn this expression, ''a'' is a ''constant'', not a ''variable'', so ''f<sub>a</sub>'' is a function of only one real variable.  Consequently, the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies:\n:<math>f_a'(y) = a + 2y.</math>\nThe above procedure can be performed for any choice of ''a''.  Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function that describes the variation of ''f'' in the ''y'' direction:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y) = x + 2y.</math>\nThis is the partial derivative of ''f'' with respect to ''y''.  Here [[\u2202]] is a rounded ''d'' called the '''partial derivative symbol'''.  To distinguish it from the letter ''d'', \u2202 is sometimes pronounced \"der\", \"del\", or \"partial\" instead of \"dee\".\n\nIn general, the '''partial derivative''' of a function {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} in the direction ''x<sub>i</sub>'' at the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) is defined to be:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n) = \\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i+h,\\ldots,a_n) - f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i,\\ldots,a_n)}{h}.</math>\nIn the above difference quotient, all the variables except ''x<sub>i</sub>'' are held fixed.  That choice of fixed values determines a function of one variable\n:<math>f_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}(x_i) = f(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},x_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n),</math>\nand, by definition,\n:<math>\\frac{df_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}}{dx_i}(a_i) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n).</math>\nIn other words, the different choices of ''a'' index a family of one-variable functions just as in the example above.  This expression also shows that the computation of partial derivatives reduces to the computation of one-variable derivatives.\n\nAn important example of a function of several variables is the case of a [[scalar-valued function]] {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} on a domain in Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> (e.g., on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>). In this case ''f'' has a partial derivative \u2202''f''/\u2202''x''<sub>''j''</sub> with respect to each variable ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>. At the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>), these partial derivatives define the vector\n:<math>\\nabla f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n), \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)\\right).</math>\nThis vector is called the '''[[gradient]]''' of ''f'' at ''a''.  If ''f'' is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function \u2207''f'' that takes the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) to the vector \u2207''f''(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>).  Consequently, the gradient determines a [[vector field]].\n\n===Directional derivatives===\n{{Main|Directional derivative}}\n\nIf ''f'' is a real-valued function on '''R'''<sup>n</sup>, then the partial derivatives of ''f'' measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes.  For example, if ''f'' is a function of ''x'' and ''y'', then its partial derivatives measure the variation in ''f'' in the ''x'' direction and the ''y'' direction.  They do not, however, directly measure the variation of ''f'' in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}.  These are measured using directional derivatives.  Choose a vector\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1,\\ldots,v_n).</math>\nThe '''directional derivative''' of ''f'' in the direction of '''v''' at the point '''x''' is the limit\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}{\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + h\\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{h}}.</math>\nIn some cases it may be easier to compute or estimate the directional derivative after changing the length of the vector.  Often this is done to turn the problem into the computation of a directional derivative in the direction of a unit vector.  To see how this works, suppose that {{nowrap|1='''v''' = ''\u03bb'''''u'''}}.  Substitute {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''k''/''\u03bb''}} into the difference quotient.  The difference quotient becomes:\n:<math>\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + (k/\\lambda)(\\lambda\\mathbf{u})) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k/\\lambda}\n= \\lambda\\cdot\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + k\\mathbf{u}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k}.</math>\nThis is ''\u03bb'' times the difference quotient for the directional derivative of ''f'' with respect to '''u'''. Furthermore, taking the limit as ''h'' tends to zero is the same as taking the limit as ''k'' tends to zero because ''h'' and ''k'' are multiples of each other.  Therefore, {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') = \u03bb''D''<sub>'''u'''</sub>(''f'')}}.  Because of this rescaling property, directional derivatives are frequently considered only for unit vectors.\n\nIf all the partial derivatives of ''f'' exist and are continuous at '''x''', then they determine the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v''' by the formula:\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{j=1}^n v_j \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}.</math>\nThis is a consequence of the definition of the [[total derivative]].  It follows that the directional derivative is [[linear map|linear]] in '''v''', meaning that {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v''' + '''w'''</sub>(''f'') = ''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') + ''D''<sub>'''w'''</sub>(''f'')}}.\n\nThe same definition also works when ''f'' is a function with values in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. The above definition is applied to each component of the vectors.  In this case, the directional derivative is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.\n\n===Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix===\n{{Main|Total derivative}}\n\nWhen ''f'' is a function from an open subset of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, then the directional derivative of ''f'' in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at that point and in that direction.  But when {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}}, no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of ''f''. The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once.  That is, for any vector '''v''' starting at '''a''', the linear approximation formula holds:\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nJust like the single-variable derivative, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;&prime;('''a''')}} is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible.\n\nIf ''n'' and ''m'' are both one, then the derivative {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} is a number and the expression {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''v''}} is the product of two numbers. But in higher dimensions, it is impossible for {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} to be a number. If it were a number, then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} would be a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> while the other terms would be vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and therefore the formula would not make sense. For the linear approximation formula to make sense, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a function that sends vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} must denote this function evaluated at '''v'''.\n\nTo determine what kind of function it is, notice that the linear approximation formula can be rewritten as\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a}) \\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nNotice that if we choose another vector '''w''', then this approximate equation determines another approximate equation by substituting '''w''' for '''v'''. It determines a third approximate equation by substituting both '''w''' for '''v''' and {{nowrap|'''a''' + '''v'''}} for '''a'''. By subtracting these two new equations, we get\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a})\n\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{w} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.</math>\nIf we assume that '''v''' is small and that the derivative varies continuously in '''a''', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''' + '''v''')}} is approximately equal to {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}}, and therefore the right-hand side is approximately zero. The left-hand side can be rewritten in a different way using the linear approximation formula with {{nowrap|'''v''' + '''w'''}} substituted for '''v'''. The linear approximation formula implies:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n0\n&\\approx f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a}) \\\\\n&= (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) \\\\\n&\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis suggests that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a [[linear transformation]] from the vector space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to the vector space '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. In fact, it is possible to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations.  Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times ||'''v'''||, where the constant is independent of '''v''' but depends continuously on '''a'''. Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities.  In particular, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a linear transformation up to a small error term.  In the limit as '''v''' and '''w''' tend to zero, it must therefore be a linear transformation. Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as '''v''' goes to zero, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a linear transformation.\n\nIn one variable, the fact that the derivative is the best linear approximation is expressed by the fact that it is the limit of difference quotients.  However, the usual difference quotient does not make sense in higher dimensions because it is not usually possible to divide vectors. In particular, the numerator and denominator of the difference quotient are not even in the same vector space: The numerator lies in the codomain '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> while the denominator lies in the domain '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. Furthermore, the derivative is a linear transformation, a different type of object from both the numerator and denominator.  To make precise the idea that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is the best linear approximation, it is necessary to adapt a different formula for the one-variable derivative in which these problems disappear. If {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}}, then the usual definition of the derivative may be manipulated to show that the derivative of ''f'' at ''a'' is the unique number {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)}{h} = 0.</math>\nThis is equivalent to\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)|}{|h|} = 0</math>\nbecause the limit of a function tends to zero if and only if the limit of the absolute value of the function tends to zero.  This last formula can be adapted to the many-variable situation by replacing the absolute values with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s.\n\nThe definition of the '''total derivative''' of ''f'' at '''a''', therefore, is that it is the unique linear transformation {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''') : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{\\mathbf{h}\\to 0} \\frac{\\lVert f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{h}) - (f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{h})\\rVert}{\\lVert\\mathbf{h}\\rVert} = 0.</math>\nHere '''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  However, ''f''\u2032('''a''')'''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.  If ''v'' is a vector starting at ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is called the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of '''v''' by ''f'' and is sometimes written {{nowrap|''f''<sub>\u2217</sub>'''v'''}}.\n\nIf the total derivative exists at '''a''', then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of ''f'' exist at '''a''', and for all '''v''', {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v'''.  If we write ''f'' using coordinate functions, so that {{nowrap|1=''f'' = (''f''<sub>1</sub>, ''f''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''m''</sub>)}}, then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  This matrix is called the '''[[Jacobian matrix]]''' of ''f'' at '''a''':\n\n:<math>f'(\\mathbf{a}) = \\operatorname{Jac}_{\\mathbf{a}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}\\right)_{ij}.</math>\n\nThe existence of the total derivative ''f''\u2032('''a''') is strictly stronger than the existence of all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends continuously on '''a'''.\n\nThe definition of the total derivative subsumes the definition of the derivative in one variable.  That is, if ''f'' is a real-valued function of a real variable, then the total derivative exists if and only if the usual derivative exists.  The Jacobian matrix reduces to a 1\u00d71 matrix whose only entry is the derivative ''f''&prime;(''x'').  This 1\u00d71 matrix satisfies the property that {{nowrap|''f''(''a'' + ''h'') \u2212 (''f''(''a'') + ''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''h'')}} is approximately zero, in other words that\n\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h.</math>\n\nUp to changing variables, this is the statement that the function <math>x \\mapsto f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</math> is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at ''a''.\n\nThe total derivative of a function does not give another function in the same way as the one-variable case.  This is because the total derivative of a multivariable function has to record much more information than the derivative of a single-variable function.  Instead, the total derivative gives a function from the [[tangent bundle]] of the source to the tangent bundle of the target.\n\nThe natural analog of second, third, and higher-order total derivatives is not a linear transformation, is not a function on the tangent bundle, and is not built by repeatedly taking the total derivative. The analog of a higher-order derivative, called a [[jet (mathematics)|jet]], cannot be a linear transformation because higher-order derivatives reflect subtle geometric information, such as concavity, which cannot be described in terms of linear data such as vectors.  It cannot be a function on the tangent bundle because the tangent bundle only has room for the base space and the directional derivatives. Because jets capture higher-order information, they take as arguments additional coordinates representing higher-order changes in direction. The space determined by these additional coordinates is called the [[jet bundle]].  The relation between the total derivative and the partial derivatives of a function is paralleled in the relation between the ''k''th order jet of a function and its partial derivatives of order less than or equal to ''k''.\n\nBy repeatedly taking the total derivative, one obtains higher versions of the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]], specialized to '''R'''<sup>''p''</sup>. The ''k''th order total derivative may be interpreted as a map\n:<math>D^k f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to L^k(\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{R}^n, \\mathbb{R}^m)</math>\nwhich takes a point '''x''' in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and assigns to it an element of the space of ''k''-linear maps from '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> \u2013 the \"best\" (in a certain precise sense) ''k''-linear approximation to ''f'' at that point. By precomposing it with the [[Diagonal functor|diagonal map]] \u0394, {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2192 ('''x''', '''x''')}}, a generalized Taylor series may be begun as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n f(\\mathbf{x}) & \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x-a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\Delta(\\mathbf{x-a})) + \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x - a}) + \\left(D^2 f\\right)(\\mathbf{x - a}, \\mathbf{x - a})+ \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + \\sum_i (D f)_i (x_i-a_i) + \\sum_{j, k} \\left(D^2 f\\right)_{j k} (x_j-a_j) (x_k-a_k) + \\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere f('''a''') is identified with a constant function, {{nowrap|''x''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2212 ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are the components of the vector {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2212 '''a'''}}, and {{nowrap|(''Df'')<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{nowrap|(''D''<sup>2</sup>''f'')<sub>''jk''</sub>}} are the components of {{nowrap|''Df''}} and {{nowrap|''D''<sup>2</sup>''f''}} as linear transformations.\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{Main|Derivative (generalizations)}}\n\nThe concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a [[linear approximation]] of the function at that point.\n* An important generalization of the derivative concerns [[complex function]]s of [[Complex number|complex variable]]s, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers '''C''' to '''C'''. The notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If '''C''' is identified with '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by writing a complex number ''z'' as {{nowrap|''x'' + ''iy''}}, then a differentiable function from '''C''' to '''C''' is certainly differentiable as a function from '''R'''<sup>2</sup> to '''R'''<sup>2</sup> (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is ''complex linear'' and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]] \u2013 see [[holomorphic function]]s.\n* Another generalization concerns functions between [[smooth manifold|differentiable or smooth manifolds]]. Intuitively speaking such a manifold ''M'' is a space that can be approximated near each point ''x'' by a vector space called its [[tangent space]]: the prototypical example is a [[smooth surface]] in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. The derivative (or differential) of a (differentiable) map {{nowrap|''f'': ''M'' \u2192 ''N''}} between manifolds, at a point ''x'' in ''M'', is then a [[linear map]] from the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'' to the tangent space of ''N'' at ''f''(''x''). The derivative function becomes a map between the [[tangent bundle]]s of ''M'' and ''N''. This definition is fundamental in [[differential geometry]] and has many uses \u2013 see [[pushforward (differential)]] and [[pullback (differential geometry)]].\n* Differentiation can also be defined for maps between [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite dimensional]] [[vector space]]s such as [[Banach space]]s and [[Fr\u00e9chet space]]s.  There is a generalization both of the directional derivative, called the [[Gateaux derivative]], and of the differential, called the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]].\n* One deficiency of the classical derivative is that very many functions are not differentiable. Nevertheless, there is a way of extending the notion of the derivative so that all [[continuous function|continuous]] functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the [[weak derivative]]. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] and only require that a function is differentiable \"on average\".\n* The properties of the derivative have inspired the introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology \u2014 see, for example, [[differential algebra]].\n* The discrete equivalent of differentiation is [[finite difference]]s. The study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of finite differences in [[time scale calculus]].\n* Also see [[arithmetic derivative]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of calculus}}\n[[Calculus]], known in its early history as ''infinitesimal calculus'', is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline focused on [[limit (mathematics)|limits]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], derivatives, [[integral]]s, and [[infinite series]]. [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] independently discovered calculus in the mid-17th century. However, each inventor claimed the other stole his work in a [[Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy|bitter dispute]] that continued until the end of their lives.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Differential calculus#Applications of derivatives|Applications of derivatives]]\n* [[Automatic differentiation]]\n* [[Differentiability class]]\n* [[Differentiation rules]]\n* [[Differintegral]]\n* [[Fractal derivative]]\n* [[Generalizations of the derivative]]\n* [[Hasse derivative]]\n* [[History of calculus]]\n* [[Integral]]\n* [[Infinitesimal]]\n* [[Linearization]]\n* [[Mathematical analysis]]\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]\n* [[Numerical differentiation]]\n* [[Rate (mathematics)]]\n* [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem]]\n* [[Symmetric derivative]]\n* [[Schwarzian derivative]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Print===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Anton\n | first = Howard\n | last2 = Bivens\n | first2 = Irl\n | last3 = Davis\n | first3 = Stephen\n | date = February 2, 2005\n | title = Calculus: Early Transcendentals Single and Multivariable\n | place = New York\n | publisher = Wiley\n | edition = 8th\n | isbn  = 978-0-471-47244-5\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Apostol\n | first = Tom M.\n | author-link = Tom M.

{"title_page": "Quartal and quintal harmony", "text_new": "{{short description|Types of harmonic structures in music}}\n{{redirects|Fourth chord||Eleventh chord#Fourth}}\n\nIn [[music]], '''quartal harmony''' is the building of [[Harmony|harmonic]] structures built from the [[Interval (music)|intervals]] of the [[perfect fourth]], the [[tritone|augmented fourth]] and the [[diminished fourth]]. For instance, a three-note quartal chord on C can be built by stacking perfect fourths, C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}. \n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c f bes>1\n} }\n</score>\n\n'''Quintal harmony''' is harmonic structure preferring the [[perfect fifth]], the [[augmented fifth]] and the [[tritone|diminished fifth]]. For instance, a three-note quintal chord on C can be built by stacking perfect fifths, C\u2013G\u2013D. \n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c g' d'>1\n} }\n</score>\n\n== Properties ==\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <a d g c f bes es>1 <bes d f a c es g>\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=The notes in a quartal chord on A can be arranged to form a [[thirteenth|thirteenth chord]] on B{{music|b}} {{harv|Benward and Saker|2009|loc=279}}.}}\nUse of the terms ''quartal'' and ''quintal'' arises from a contrast, compositional or perceptual, with traditional [[tertian]] harmonic constructions. Listeners familiar with music of the (European) [[common practice period]] perceive [[tonality|tonal]] music as that which uses [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] [[chord (music)|chords]] and [[musical scale|scales]], wherein both the [[major third]] and [[minor third]] constitute the basic ''structural elements'' of the harmony. \n\nRegarding chords built from perfect fourths alone, composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] writes that:\n{{quote|Chords by perfect fourth are ambiguous in that, like all chords built by equidistant intervals ([[Diminished seventh chord|diminished seventh chords]] or [[Augmented triad|augmented triads]]), any member can function as the [[Root (chord)|root]]. The indifference of this rootless harmony to tonality places the burden of [[Key (music)|key]] verification upon the [[Part (music)|voice]] with the most active melodic line. {{harv|Persichetti|1961|loc=94}}|sign=|source=}}\n\n''Quintal harmony'' (the harmonic layering of fifths specifically) is a lesser-used term, and since the fifth is the [[Inversion (interval)|inversion]] or [[Complement (music)|complement]] of the fourth, it is usually considered indistinct from ''quartal harmony''. Because of this relationship, any quartal chord can be rewritten as a quintal chord by changing the order of its pitches.\n\nLike tertian chords, a given quartal or quintal chord can be written with different [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], some of which obscure its quartal structure. For instance, the quartal chord, C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}, can be written as<blockquote><score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c f bes>1 <f bes c> <bes c f> <f bes c f>\n} }\n</score></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]], simultaneous notes a fourth apart were heard as a consonance.  During the [[common practice period]] (between about 1600 and 1900), this interval came to be heard either as a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] (when appearing as a [[Suspension (music)|suspension]] requiring resolution in the [[voice leading]]) or as a [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] (when the root of the chord appears in parts higher than the fifth of the chord).  In the later 19th century, during the [[Emancipation of the dissonance|breakdown of tonality]] in [[classical music]], all intervallic relationships were once again reassessed.  Quartal harmony was developed in the early [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] as a result of this breakdown and reevaluation of tonality.\n\n===Precursors===\nThe [[Tristan chord]] is made up of the notes F{{music|natural}}, B{{music|natural}}, D{{music|sharp}} and G{{music|sharp}} and is the first chord heard in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.  \n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\voiceOne \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red gis4.->(~ gis4 a8 ais8-> b4~ b8) r r\n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4.5\n                \\once \\override DynamicText.X-offset = #-5\n                \\voiceTwo \\partial8 a\\pp( f'4.~\\< f4 e8 \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red dis2.)(\\> d!4.)~\\p d8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red <f b>2.( <e gis>4.)~ <e gis>8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\nThe bottom two notes make up an augmented fourth, while the upper two make up a perfect fourth. This layering of fourths in this context has been seen as highly significant.  The chord had been found in earlier works ({{harvnb|Vogel|1962|loc=12}}), notably [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 18 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 18]], but Wagner's use was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional [[tonal harmony]] and even towards [[atonality]], and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its [[Functional harmony|function]], a notion which was soon after to be explored by [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and others ({{harvnb|Erickson|1975}}, {{Page needed|date=June 2012}}).  \n\nDespite the layering of fourths, it is rare to find musicologists identifying this chord as \"quartal harmony\" or even as \"proto-quartal harmony\", since Wagner's musical language is still essentially built on thirds, and even an ordinary [[dominant seventh]] chord can be laid out as augmented fourth plus perfect fourth (F\u2013B\u2013D\u2013G). Wagner's unusual chord is really a device to draw the listener into the musical-dramatic argument which the composer is presenting to us.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, quartal harmony finally became an important element of harmony. [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] used a self-developed system of transposition using fourth-chords, like his [[Mystic chord]] (shown below) in his [[Piano Sonata No. 6 (Scriabin)|Piano Sonata No. 6]]. \n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c fis bes e a d>1\n} }\n</score>\n\nScriabin wrote this chord in his sketches alongside other quartal passages and more traditional [[tertian]] passages, often passing between systems, for example widening the six-note quartal sonority (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D) into a seven-note chord (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G). Scriabin's sketches for his unfinished work ''[[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]]'' show that he intended to develop the Mystic chord into a huge chord incorporating all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]] {{harv|Morrison|1998|loc=316}}.<!-- image may be allowed for this article only: see the licensing question on its page -->\n\nIn France, [[Erik Satie]] experimented with [[Parallel harmony|planing]] in the stacked fourths (not all perfect) of his 1891 score for ''[[Le Fils des \u00e9toiles]]'' {{harv|Solomon|2003}}. [[Paul Dukas]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (1897) has a rising repetition in fourths, as the tireless work of out-of-control walking brooms causes the water level in the house to \"rise and rise\". \n===20th- and 21st-century classical music===\nComposers who use the techniques of quartal harmony include [[Claude Debussy]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]] {{harv|Herder|1987|loc=78}}.\n\n==== Schoenberg ====\n[[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[Chamber Symphony No. 1|Chamber Symphony Op. 9]] (1906) displays quartal harmony: the first measures construct a five-part fourth chord with the notes C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E{{music|flat}}\u2013A{{music|flat}} distributed over several instruments.\n\n[[Image:SchoenbergOp9.png|thumb|280x280px|Vertical quartal-harmony in the opening measures of Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9 {{audio|SchoenbergOp9.mid|Play}}|alt=|center]]\n\n[[Image:Sch\u00f6nberg Kammersymhonie 9 for wikipedia.png|thumb|250x250px|Six-note horizontal fourth chord in Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9|alt=]]\n\nThe composer then picks out this vertical quartal harmony in a horizontal sequence of fourths from the horns, eventually leading to a passage of triadic quartal harmony (i.e., chords of three notes, each layer a fourth apart).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSchoenberg was also one of the first to write on the theoretical consequences of this harmonic innovation. In his ''Theory of Harmony'' (''Harmonielehre'') of 1911, he wrote:\n{{quote|The construction of chords by superimposing fourths can lead to a chord that contains all the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]]; hence, such construction does manifest a possibility for dealing systematically with those harmonic phenomena that already exist in the works of some of us: seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve-part chords\u2026 But the quartal construction makes possible, as I said, accommodation of all phenomena of harmony. {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=406\u2013407}}}}\n\nFor [[Anton Webern]], the importance of quartal harmony lay in the possibility of building new sounds. After hearing Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony, Webern wrote \"You must write something like that, too!\" ({{harvnb|Webern|1963|loc=48}}; \"So was mu\u00dft du auch machen!\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}<!--Source for the German text needed.-->)\n\n==== Others ====\nIn his ''Theory of Harmony'' {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=407}}: \"Besides myself my students Dr. Anton Webern and [[Alban Berg]] have written these harmonies (fourth chords), but also the Hungarian [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] or the Viennese [[Franz Schreker]], who both go a similar way to Debussy, Dukas and perhaps also [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], are not far off.\"<!--- (\u201eAu\u00dfer mir haben meine Sch\u00fcler Dr. Anton Webern und Alban Berg solche Kl\u00e4nge [gemeint sind Quartenkl\u00e4nge] geschrieben.

These steps are a restructuring of fourth chords (C\u2013D\u2013G becomes the fourth chord D\u2013G\u2013C), or other mixtures of fourths and fifths (D{{music|sharp}}\u2013A{{music|sharp}}\u2013D{{music|sharp}}\u2013G{{music|sharp}}\u2013C{{music|sharp}} in measure 3 of the example).\n\nHindemith was, however, not a proponent of an explicit quartal harmony. In his 1937 writing ''Unterweisung im Tonsatz'' (''The Craft of Musical Composition'', {{harvnb|Hindemith|1937}}), he wrote that \"notes have a family of relationships, that are the bindings of tonality, in which the ranking of intervals is unambiguous,\"<!--- (\u201edass die T\u00f6ne eine Familienzugeh\u00f6rigkeit besitzen, die sich in der Bindung an tonale Hauptt\u00f6ne \u00e4u\u00dfert, die eine unzweideutige Rangliste der Tonverwandschaften aufstellt.\u201c)---> so much so, indeed, that in the art of triadic composition \"\u2026the musician is bound by this, as the painter to his primary colours, the architect to the three dimensions.\"<!--- (\u201e... der Musiker ist an ihn gebunden, wie der Maler an die prim\u00e4ren Farben, der Architekt an die drei Dimensionen.\u201c)---> He lined up the harmonic and melodic aspects of music in a row in which the octave ranks first, then the fifth and the third, and then the fourth. \"The strongest and most unique harmonic interval after the octave is the fifth, the prettiest nevertheless is the third by right of the chordal effects of its [[Combination tone]]s.\"<!--- (\u201eDas st\u00e4rkste und eindeutige harmonische Intervall ist n\u00e4chst der alleinstehenden  Oktave die Quinte, das sch\u00f6nste jedoch die Terz wegen ihrer in den Kombinationst\u00f6nen begr\u00fcndeten Akkordwirkung.\u201c)--->\n\n[[Image:Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.png|thumb|center|378x378px|Quartal harmony in Hindemith's Flute Sonata, II with tonal center on B established by descent in left hand in [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and repeated B's and F{{music|sharp}}'s {{harv|Kostka, Payne, and Alm\u00e9n|2013|loc=Chapter twenty six: Materials and techniques, Chord structures, Quartal and secundal harmony, 469\u201370<!--  Meaningful subheadings simplify reference in translations and other editions (p. 498 in third ed.) -->}} {{Audio|Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.mid|Play}}|alt=]]The works of the Filipino composer [[Eliseo M.

Jazz musicians had a clear interest in harmonic richness of colour, for which quartal harmony provided possibilities, as used by [[pianist]]s and [[arranger]]s like [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Art Tatum]], [[Bill Evans]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Milt Buckner]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Chick Corea]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) [[Herbie Hancock]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) and especially [[McCoy Tyner]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=205}}).\n\n[[Image:II V I for wikipedia.png|thumb|right|275px|The [[II-V-I progression|ii\u2013V\u2013I cadence]] {{audio|II V9 I.MID|Play}}; the fourth-suspension or [[sus chord]] {{audio|II V9sus I.MID|Play}}]]\n\n[[Image:SenorBlues.png|thumb|380px|A typical [[hard bop]] brass part, from [[Horace Silver]]'s \"Se\u00f1or Blues\"]]\n\nThe [[hard bop]] of the 1950s made new applications of quartal harmony accessible to jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Quintet]] writing in which two brass instruments (commonly trumpet and saxophone) may proceed in fourths, while the piano (as a uniquely harmonic instrument) lays down chords, but sparsely, only hinting at the intended harmony. This style of writing, in contrast with that of the previous decade, preferred a moderate tempo. Thin-sounding unison bebop horn sections occur frequently, but these are balanced by bouts of very refined [[polyphony]] such as is found in [[cool jazz]].\n\n[[File:So What chord.png|thumb|100px|The [[So What chord|\"So What\" chord]] uses three intervals of a fourth.]]\n\nOn his watershed record ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', [[Miles Davis]] with pianist [[Bill Evans]] used a chord consisting of three perfect fourth intervals and a major third on the composition \"[[So What (composition)|So What]]\". This particular voicing is sometimes referred to as a [[So What chord]], and can be analyzed (without regard for added sixths, ninths, etc.) as a minor seventh with the root on the bottom, or as a major seventh with the third on the bottom {{harv|Levine|1989|loc=97}}.\n\nFrom the outset of the 1960s, the employment of quartal possibilities had become so familiar that the musician now felt the fourth chord existed as a separate entity, self standing and free of any need to resolve. The pioneering of quartal writing in later jazz and rock, like the pianist [[McCoy Tyner]]'s work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]]'s \"classic quartet\", was influential throughout this epoch. [[Oliver Nelson]] was also known for his use of fourth chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]] {{harv|Corozine|2002|loc=12}}. Floyd claims that the \"foundation of 'modern quartal harmony'\" began in the era when the [[Charlie Parker]]\u2013influenced John Coltrane added classically trained pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner to his ensemble {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}}.\n\nJazz guitarists cited as using chord voicings using quartal harmony include [[Johnny Smith]], [[Tal Farlow]], [[Chuck Wayne]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Joe Pass]], [[Jimmy Raney]], [[Wes Montgomery]], however all in a traditional manner, as major 9th, 13th and minor 11th chords {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}} (an octave and fourth equals an 11th). Jazz guitarists cited as using modern quartal harmony include [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] (especially [[Sonny Rollins]]'s ''[[The Bridge (Sonny Rollins album)|The Bridge]]''), [[George Benson]] (\"Skydive\"), [[Pat Martino]], [[Jack Wilkins]] (\"Windows\"), [[Joe Diorio]], [[Howard Roberts]] (\"Impressions\"), [[Kenny Burrell]] (\"So What\"), [[Wes Montgomery]] (\"Little Sunflower\"), [[Henry Johnson (guitarist)|Henry Johnson]], [[Russell Malone]], [[Jimmy Bruno]], [[Howard Alden]], [[Paul Bollenback]], [[Mark Whitfield]], and [[Rodney Jones (guitarist)|Rodney Jones]] {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}}.\n\nQuartal harmony was also explored as a possibility under new experimental [[Scale (music)|scale]] models as they were \"discovered\" by jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Musicians began to work extensively with the so-called [[Mode (music)|church modes]] of old European music, and they became firmly situated in their compositional process. Jazz was well-suited to incorporate the medieval use of fourths to thicken lines into its improvisation. The pianists [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Chick Corea]] are two musicians well known for their modal experimentation. Around this time, a style known as [[free jazz]] also came into being, in which quartal harmony had extensive use due to the wandering nature of its harmony.\n\n[[Image:Maiden Voyage2.png|thumb|center|400px|Fourths in Herbie Hancock's \"[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]\"{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}]]\n\nIn jazz, the way chords were built from a scale came to be called [[voicing (music)|voicing]], and specifically quartal harmony was referred to as fourth voicing.\n\n[[Image:Quartal voicings.png|thumb|center|400px|[[ii-V-I turnaround]] with fourth voicings: all chords are in fourth voicings {{audio|Quartal voicings.mid|Play}}; They are often ambiguous as, for example, the Dm11 and G9sus chords are here voiced identically and will thus be distinguished for the listener by the [[root (chord)|root]] movement of the [[bassist]] {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=94}}]]\n\nThus when the m11 and the dominant 7th sus (9sus above) chords in quartal voicings are used together they tend to \"blend into one overall sound\" sometimes referred to as modal voicings, and both may be applied where the m11 chord is called for during extended periods such as the entire chorus {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=95}}.\n\n===Rock music===\n[[image:Robert Fripp.jpg|right|thumb|Disliking the sound of thirds (in equal-temperament tuning), Robert Fripp builds chords with perfect intervals in his new&nbsp;standard tuning.]]\n{{See also|Progressive rock|Symphonic rock}}\n\nQuartal and quintal harmony have been used by [[Robert Fripp]], who has described himself as the <!-- self-described.

Fripp dislikes minor thirds and especially major thirds in [[equal temperament]] tuning, which is used by non-experimental guitars. Of course, [[just intonation]]'s perfect octaves, perfect fifths, and perfect fourths are well approximated in equal temperament tuning, and perfect fifths and octaves are highly consonant intervals. Fripp builds chords using perfect fifths, fourths, and octaves in his [[new&nbsp;standard tuning]]&nbsp;(NST), a [[regular tuning]] having perfect fifths between its successive [[open string (music)|open-string]]s ({{harvnb|Mulhern|1986}}, {{Page needed|date=January 2013}}<!--The specific page citation is needed here;

Listeners familiar with music of the (European) [[common practice period]] perceive [[tonality|tonal]] music as that which uses [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] [[chord (music)|chords]] and [[musical scale|scales]], wherein both the [[major third]] and [[minor third]] constitute the basic ''structural elements'' of the harmony. \n\nRegarding chords built from perfect fourths alone, composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] writes that:\n{{quote|Chords by perfect fourth are ambiguous in that, like all chords built by equidistant intervals ([[Diminished seventh chord|diminished seventh chords]] or [[Augmented triad|augmented triads]]), any member can function as the [[Root (chord)|root]]. The indifference of this rootless harmony to tonality places the burden of [[Key (music)|key]] verification upon the [[Part (music)|voice]] with the most active melodic line. {{harv|Persichetti|1961|loc=94}}|sign=|source=}}\n\n''Quintal harmony'' (the harmonic layering of fifths specifically) is a lesser-used term, and since the fifth is the [[Inversion (interval)|inversion]] or [[Complement (music)|complement]] of the fourth, it is usually considered indistinct from ''quartal harmony''. Because of this relationship, any quartal chord can be rewritten as a quintal chord by changing the order of its pitches.\n\nLike tertian chords, a given quartal or quintal chord can be written with different [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], some of which obscure its quartal structure. For instance, the quartal chord, C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}, can be written as<blockquote><score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c f bes>1 <f bes c> <bes c f> <f bes c f>\n} }\n</score></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]], simultaneous notes a fourth apart were heard as a consonance.  During the [[common practice period]] (between about 1600 and 1900), this interval came to be heard either as a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] (when appearing as a [[Suspension (music)|suspension]] requiring resolution in the [[voice leading]]) or as a [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] (when the root of the chord appears in parts higher than the fifth of the chord).  In the later 19th century, during the [[Emancipation of the dissonance|breakdown of tonality]] in [[classical music]], all intervallic relationships were once again reassessed.  Quartal harmony was developed in the early [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] as a result of this breakdown and reevaluation of tonality.\n\n===Precursors===\nThe [[Tristan chord]] is made up of the notes F{{music|natural}}, B{{music|natural}}, D{{music|sharp}} and G{{music|sharp}} and is the first chord heard in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.  \n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\voiceOne \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red gis4.->(~ gis4 a8 ais8-> b4~ b8) r r\n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4.5\n                \\once \\override DynamicText.X-offset = #-5\n                \\voiceTwo \\partial8 a\\pp( f'4.~\\< f4 e8 \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red dis2.)(\\> d!4.)~\\p d8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red <f b>2.( <e gis>4.)~ <e gis>8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\nThe bottom two notes make up an augmented fourth, while the upper two make up a perfect fourth. This layering of fourths in this context has been seen as highly significant.  The chord had been found in earlier works ({{harvnb|Vogel|1962|loc=12}}), notably [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 18 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 18]], but Wagner's use was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional [[tonal harmony]] and even towards [[atonality]], and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its [[Functional harmony|function]], a notion which was soon after to be explored by [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and others ({{harvnb|Erickson|1975}}, {{Page needed|date=June 2012}}).  \n\nDespite the layering of fourths, it is rare to find musicologists identifying this chord as \"quartal harmony\" or even as \"proto-quartal harmony\", since Wagner's musical language is still essentially built on thirds, and even an ordinary [[dominant seventh]] chord can be laid out as augmented fourth plus perfect fourth (F\u2013B\u2013D\u2013G). Wagner's unusual chord is really a device to draw the listener into the musical-dramatic argument which the composer is presenting to us.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, quartal harmony finally became an important element of harmony. [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] used a self-developed system of transposition using fourth-chords, like his [[Mystic chord]] (shown below) in his [[Piano Sonata No. 6 (Scriabin)|Piano Sonata No. 6]]. \n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c fis bes e a d>1\n} }\n</score>\n\nScriabin wrote this chord in his sketches alongside other quartal passages and more traditional [[tertian]] passages, often passing between systems, for example widening the six-note quartal sonority (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D) into a seven-note chord (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G). Scriabin's sketches for his unfinished work ''[[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]]'' show that he intended to develop the Mystic chord into a huge chord incorporating all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]] {{harv|Morrison|1998|loc=316}}.<!-- image may be allowed for this article only: see the licensing question on its page -->\n\nIn France, [[Erik Satie]] experimented with [[Parallel harmony|planing]] in the stacked fourths (not all perfect) of his 1891 score for ''[[Le Fils des \u00e9toiles]]'' {{harv|Solomon|2003}}. [[Paul Dukas]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (1897) has a rising repetition in fourths, as the tireless work of out-of-control walking brooms causes the water level in the house to \"rise and rise\". \n===20th- and 21st-century classical music===\nComposers who use the techniques of quartal harmony include [[Claude Debussy]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]] {{harv|Herder|1987|loc=78}}.\n\n==== Schoenberg ====\n[[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[Chamber Symphony No. 1|Chamber Symphony Op. 9]] (1906) displays quartal harmony: the first measures construct a five-part fourth chord with the notes C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E{{music|flat}}\u2013A{{music|flat}} distributed over several instruments.\n\n[[Image:SchoenbergOp9.png|thumb|280x280px|Vertical quartal-harmony in the opening measures of Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9 {{audio|SchoenbergOp9.mid|Play}}|alt=|center]]\n\n[[Image:Sch\u00f6nberg Kammersymhonie 9 for wikipedia.png|thumb|250x250px|Six-note horizontal fourth chord in Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9|alt=]]\n\nThe composer then picks out this vertical quartal harmony in a horizontal sequence of fourths from the horns, eventually leading to a passage of triadic quartal harmony (i.e., chords of three notes, each layer a fourth apart).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSchoenberg was also one of the first to write on the theoretical consequences of this harmonic innovation. In his ''Theory of Harmony'' (''Harmonielehre'') of 1911, he wrote:\n{{quote|The construction of chords by superimposing fourths can lead to a chord that contains all the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]]; hence, such construction does manifest a possibility for dealing systematically with those harmonic phenomena that already exist in the works of some of us: seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve-part chords\u2026 But the quartal construction makes possible, as I said, accommodation of all phenomena of harmony. {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=406\u2013407}}}}\n\nFor [[Anton Webern]], the importance of quartal harmony lay in the possibility of building new sounds. After hearing Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony, Webern wrote \"You must write something like that, too!\" ({{harvnb|Webern|1963|loc=48}}; \"So was mu\u00dft du auch machen!\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}<!--Source for the German text needed.-->)\n\n==== Others ====\nIn his ''Theory of Harmony'' {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=407}}: \"Besides myself my students Dr. Anton Webern and [[Alban Berg]] have written these harmonies (fourth chords), but also the Hungarian [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] or the Viennese [[Franz Schreker]], who both go a similar way to Debussy, Dukas and perhaps also [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], are not far off.\"<!--- (\u201eAu\u00dfer mir haben meine Sch\u00fcler Dr. Anton Webern und Alban Berg solche Kl\u00e4nge [gemeint sind Quartenkl\u00e4nge] geschrieben.

These steps are a restructuring of fourth chords (C\u2013D\u2013G becomes the fourth chord D\u2013G\u2013C), or other mixtures of fourths and fifths (D{{music|sharp}}\u2013A{{music|sharp}}\u2013D{{music|sharp}}\u2013G{{music|sharp}}\u2013C{{music|sharp}} in measure 3 of the example).\n\nHindemith was, however, not a proponent of an explicit quartal harmony. In his 1937 writing ''Unterweisung im Tonsatz'' (''The Craft of Musical Composition'', {{harvnb|Hindemith|1937}}), he wrote that \"notes have a family of relationships, that are the bindings of tonality, in which the ranking of intervals is unambiguous,\"<!--- (\u201edass die T\u00f6ne eine Familienzugeh\u00f6rigkeit besitzen, die sich in der Bindung an tonale Hauptt\u00f6ne \u00e4u\u00dfert, die eine unzweideutige Rangliste der Tonverwandschaften aufstellt.\u201c)---> so much so, indeed, that in the art of triadic composition \"\u2026the musician is bound by this, as the painter to his primary colours, the architect to the three dimensions.\"<!--- (\u201e... der Musiker ist an ihn gebunden, wie der Maler an die prim\u00e4ren Farben, der Architekt an die drei Dimensionen.\u201c)---> He lined up the harmonic and melodic aspects of music in a row in which the octave ranks first, then the fifth and the third, and then the fourth. \"The strongest and most unique harmonic interval after the octave is the fifth, the prettiest nevertheless is the third by right of the chordal effects of its [[Combination tone]]s.\"<!--- (\u201eDas st\u00e4rkste und eindeutige harmonische Intervall ist n\u00e4chst der alleinstehenden  Oktave die Quinte, das sch\u00f6nste jedoch die Terz wegen ihrer in den Kombinationst\u00f6nen begr\u00fcndeten Akkordwirkung.\u201c)--->\n\n[[Image:Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.png|thumb|center|378x378px|Quartal harmony in Hindemith's Flute Sonata, II with tonal center on B established by descent in left hand in [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and repeated B's and F{{music|sharp}}'s {{harv|Kostka, Payne, and Alm\u00e9n|2013|loc=Chapter twenty six: Materials and techniques, Chord structures, Quartal and secundal harmony, 469\u201370<!--  Meaningful subheadings simplify reference in translations and other editions (p. 498 in third ed.) -->}} {{Audio|Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.mid|Play}}|alt=]]The works of the Filipino composer [[Eliseo M.

In the first movement of his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]] altered fourth chords descend chromatically in the right hand with a chromatic scale leading upward in the left hand.\n\n===Jazz===\nThe style of jazz, having an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] harmonic orbit, was in its [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|early days]] overtaken (until perhaps the [[Swing (genre)|Swing]] of the 1930s) by the vocabulary of 19th-century European music.{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}<!--This makes almost no sense at all.

Jazz musicians had a clear interest in harmonic richness of colour, for which quartal harmony provided possibilities, as used by [[pianist]]s and [[arranger]]s like [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Art Tatum]], [[Bill Evans]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Milt Buckner]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Chick Corea]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) [[Herbie Hancock]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) and especially [[McCoy Tyner]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=205}}).\n\n[[Image:II V I for wikipedia.png|thumb|right|275px|The [[II-V-I progression|ii\u2013V\u2013I cadence]] {{audio|II V9 I.MID|Play}}; the fourth-suspension or [[sus chord]] {{audio|II V9sus I.MID|Play}}]]\n\n[[Image:SenorBlues.png|thumb|380px|A typical [[hard bop]] brass part, from [[Horace Silver]]'s \"Se\u00f1or Blues\"]]\n\nThe [[hard bop]] of the 1950s made new applications of quartal harmony accessible to jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Quintet]] writing in which two brass instruments (commonly trumpet and saxophone) may proceed in fourths, while the piano (as a uniquely harmonic instrument) lays down chords, but sparsely, only hinting at the intended harmony.

Thin-sounding unison bebop horn sections occur frequently, but these are balanced by bouts of very refined [[polyphony]] such as is found in [[cool jazz]].\n\n[[File:So What chord.png|thumb|100px|The [[So What chord|\"So What\" chord]] uses three intervals of a fourth.]]\n\nOn his watershed record ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', [[Miles Davis]] with pianist [[Bill Evans]] used a chord consisting of three perfect fourth intervals and a major third on the composition \"[[So What (composition)|So What]]\". This particular voicing is sometimes referred to as a [[So What chord]], and can be analyzed (without regard for added sixths, ninths, etc.) as a minor seventh with the root on the bottom, or as a major seventh with the third on the bottom {{harv|Levine|1989|loc=97}}.\n\nFrom the outset of the 1960s, the employment of quartal possibilities had become so familiar that the musician now felt the fourth chord existed as a separate entity, self standing and free of any need to resolve. The pioneering of quartal writing in later jazz and rock, like the pianist [[McCoy Tyner]]'s work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]]'s \"classic quartet\", was influential throughout this epoch. [[Oliver Nelson]] was also known for his use of fourth chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]] {{harv|Corozine|2002|loc=12}}. Floyd claims that the \"foundation of 'modern quartal harmony'\" began in the era when the [[Charlie Parker]]\u2013influenced John Coltrane added classically trained pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner to his ensemble {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}}.\n\nJazz guitarists cited as using chord voicings using quartal harmony include [[Johnny Smith]], [[Tal Farlow]], [[Chuck Wayne]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Joe Pass]], [[Jimmy Raney]], [[Wes Montgomery]], however all in a traditional manner, as major 9th, 13th and minor 11th chords {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}} (an octave and fourth equals an 11th). Jazz guitarists cited as using modern quartal harmony include [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] (especially [[Sonny Rollins]]'s ''[[The Bridge (Sonny Rollins album)|The Bridge]]''), [[George Benson]] (\"Skydive\"), [[Pat Martino]], [[Jack Wilkins]] (\"Windows\"), [[Joe Diorio]], [[Howard Roberts]] (\"Impressions\"), [[Kenny Burrell]] (\"So What\"), [[Wes Montgomery]] (\"Little Sunflower\"), [[Henry Johnson (guitarist)|Henry Johnson]], [[Russell Malone]], [[Jimmy Bruno]], [[Howard Alden]], [[Paul Bollenback]], [[Mark Whitfield]], and [[Rodney Jones (guitarist)|Rodney Jones]] {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}}.\n\nQuartal harmony was also explored as a possibility under new experimental [[Scale (music)|scale]] models as they were \"discovered\" by jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Musicians began to work extensively with the so-called [[Mode (music)|church modes]] of old European music, and they became firmly situated in their compositional process. Jazz was well-suited to incorporate the medieval use of fourths to thicken lines into its improvisation. The pianists [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Chick Corea]] are two musicians well known for their modal experimentation. Around this time, a style known as [[free jazz]] also came into being, in which quartal harmony had extensive use due to the wandering nature of its harmony.\n\n[[Image:Maiden Voyage2.png|thumb|center|400px|Fourths in Herbie Hancock's \"[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]\"{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}]]\n\nIn jazz, the way chords were built from a scale came to be called [[voicing (music)|voicing]], and specifically quartal harmony was referred to as fourth voicing.\n\n[[Image:Quartal voicings.png|thumb|center|400px|[[ii-V-I turnaround]] with fourth voicings: all chords are in fourth voicings {{audio|Quartal voicings.mid|Play}}; They are often ambiguous as, for example, the Dm11 and G9sus chords are here voiced identically and will thus be distinguished for the listener by the [[root (chord)|root]] movement of the [[bassist]] {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=94}}]]\n\nThus when the m11 and the dominant 7th sus (9sus above) chords in quartal voicings are used together they tend to \"blend into one overall sound\" sometimes referred to as modal voicings, and both may be applied where the m11 chord is called for during extended periods such as the entire chorus {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=95}}.\n\n===Rock music===\n[[image:Robert Fripp.jpg|right|thumb|Disliking the sound of thirds (in equal-temperament tuning), Robert Fripp builds chords with perfect intervals in his new&nbsp;standard tuning.]]\n{{See also|Progressive rock|Symphonic rock}}\n\nQuartal and quintal harmony have been used by [[Robert Fripp]], who has described himself as the <!-- self-described.

Fripp dislikes minor thirds and especially major thirds in [[equal temperament]] tuning, which is used by non-experimental guitars.
