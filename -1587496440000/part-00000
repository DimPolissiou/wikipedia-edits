The variety spoken in [[Zamboanga City]], located in the southern Philippine island group of Mindanao, has the highest concentration of speakers. Other currently existing varieties are found in Cavite City and Ternate, located in the Cavite province on the island of Luzon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/cbk|title=Chavacano|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}</ref> Chavacano is the only Spanish-based [[Creole language|creole]] in [[Asia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zamboanga.com/history/history_chabacano_versus_related_creoles.htm|title=The Early History of Chavacano de Zamboanga: Chabacano versus related creoles|website=www.zamboanga.com|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref>\n\nThe different varieties of Chavacano differ in certain aspects like vocabulary but they are generally [[mutually intelligible]] by speakers of these varieties, especially between neighboring varieties. While a majority of the lexicon of the different Chavacano varieties derive from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], their grammatical structures are generally similar to other [[Philippine languages]]. Among [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], it is the only one that is not an [[Austronesian language]], but like [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]], it uses [[reduplication]].\n\nThe word ''{{wiktes|chabacano|Chabacano}}'' is derived from Spanish, roughly meaning \"poor taste\" or \"vulgar\", though the term itself carries no negative connotations to contemporary speakers and has lost its original Spanish meaning.\n\n== Distribution and variants ==\n\n===Varieties===\n[[Image:Map chavacano.gif|thumb|right|190px|Native Zamboangue\u00f1o speakers in Mindanao]]\n\nLinguists have identified at least six Spanish Creole varieties in the Philippines. Their classification is based on their [[substratum|substrate languages]] and the regions where they are commonly spoken. The three known varieties of Chavacano with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] as their substrate language are the [[Luzon]]-based creoles of which are '''Cavite\u00f1o''' (spoken in [[Cavite City]]), '''Bahra''' or '''Ternate\u00f1o''' (spoken in [[Ternate, Cavite]]) and '''Ermite\u00f1o''' (once spoken in the old district of [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]] in [[Manila]] and is now extinct).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Variety\n! style=\"width:13%;\"| Places\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Native speakers\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Zamboangue\u00f1o (Zamboangue\u00f1o/Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano/Chabacano de Zamboanga)'''||'''[[Zamboanga City]], [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], [[Tawi-Tawi]], [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]],''' || 359,000 (Rubino 2008, citing 2000 census)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\">Ethnologue</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Cavite\u00f1o (Chabacano di Nisos/Chabacano de Cavite)'''||'''[[Cavite]]'''|| 4,000 (2013)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Cotabate\u00f1o (Chabacano de Cotabato)'''||'''[[Cotabato City]], [[Maguindanao]]'''|| Dead\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Castellano Abakay (Chabacano Davaoe\u00f1o)'''||'''[[Davao Region]],''' '''[[Davao City]]'''|| Extinct \n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Ternate\u00f1o (Bahra)'''||'''[[Ternate, Cavite|Ternate]]'''|| 3,000 (2013)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Ermite\u00f1o (Ermitense)'''||'''[[Ermita]]'''|| Extinct\n|}\n\nThere are a number of theories on how these different varieties of Chavacano have evolved and how they are related to one another. According to some linguists, Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano is believed to have been influenced by Cavite\u00f1o Chabacano as evidenced by prominent [[Zamboangue\u00f1o]] families who descended from Spanish Army officers (from [[Spain]] and [[Latin America]]), primarily Cavite\u00f1o mestizos, stationed at [[Fort Pilar]] in the 19th century. When Cavite\u00f1o officers recruited workers and technicians from [[Iloilo]] to man their [[sugar]] plantations and [[rice]] fields to reduce the local population's dependence on the Donativo de Zamboanga, the Spanish colonial government levied taxes on the islanders to support the fort's operations. With the subsequent migration of Ilonggo traders to Zamboanga, the Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano was infused with Hiligaynon words as the previous migrant community was assimilated.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205215037/http://www.zamboanga.org/chavacano/chabacano_by_ben_saavedra.htm|title=Mensajes Y Noticias|date=2005-02-05|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>\n\nMost of what appears to be [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] words in Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano are actually Hiligaynon. Although Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano's contact with Cebuano began much earlier when Cebuano soldiers were stationed at Fort Pilar during the Spanish colonial period, it was not until closer to the middle of the 20th century that borrowings from Cebuano accelerated from more migration from the Visayas as well as the current migration from other Visayan-speaking areas of the Zamboanga Peninsula.\n\n'''Zamboangue\u00f1o''' (Chavacano) is spoken in [[Zamboanga City]], [[Basilan]], parts of [[Sulu]] and [[Tawi-Tawi]], and [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]] and [[Zamboanga del Norte]]. Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano is the most dynamically spoken language of Philippine Creole Spanish. It is used as a lingua franca between both Muslim and Christians in the Southwestern Mindanao and Basilan Islands communities. Its influence has spread to other islands in the west, such as the Jolo Islands, as well as to Cotabato and Davao in Mindanao, and finally down south to Malaysia.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2005-06-01|title=The Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages and the Society for Pidgin and Creole Linguistics, In Retrospect|journal=Creole Language in Creole Literatures|volume=20|issue=1|pages=167\u2013174|doi=10.1075/jpcl.20.1.09gil|issn=0920-9034}}</ref> The other varieties of Chavacano with [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] as their primary substrate language are the [[Mindanao]]-based creoles of which are '''Castellano Abakay''' or '''Chavacano Davaoe\u00f1o''' (now extinct but was spoken in some areas of [[Davao City|Davao]]), influenced by [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and divided into two varieties, ''Castellano Abakay Chino'' and ''Castellano Abakay Jap\u00f3n'', and '''Cotabate\u00f1o''' (no longer spoken in [[Cotabato City]]). Both Cotabate\u00f1o and Davaoe\u00f1o are very similar to Zamboangue\u00f1o.\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe Chavacano languages in the Philippines are creoles based on [[Mexican Spanish]] and possibly, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. In some Chavacano languages, most words are common with [[Andalusian Spanish]], but there are many words borrowed from [[Nahuatl]], a language native to Central Mexico, which aren\u2019t found in Andalusian Spanish. Although the vocabulary is largely Mexican, its grammar is mostly based on other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], primarily [[Hiligaynon language|Ilonggo]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]. By way of Spanish, its vocabulary also has influences from the Native American languages [[Nahuatl]], [[Taino]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], etc. as can be evidenced by the words chongo (monkey, instead of Spanish '{{wiktspa|mono}}'), tiange (mini markets), etc.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn contrast with the Luzon-based dialects, the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety has the most borrowings and/or influence from other Philippine [[Austronesian languages]] including [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. Words of [[Malay language|Malay]] origin are present in the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety; the latter is included because although not local in Philippines, it was the lingua franca of [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. As the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety is also spoken by Muslims, the variety has some [[Arabic language|Arabic]] loanwords, most commonly [[Glossary of Islam|Islamic terms]].{{specify|date=February 2018}}{{dubious|date=February 2018}} In spite of this, it\u2019s difficult to trace whether these words have their origin in the local population or in Spanish itself, given that Spanish has about 6,000 words of Arabic origin. Chavacano also contains loanwords of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin which enter Chavacano via Malay and Arabic; both Persian and Spanish are [[Indo-European languages]].\n\n===Demographics===\nThe highest number of Chavacano speakers are found in '''[[Zamboanga City]]''' and in the island province of [[Basilan]]. A significant number of Chavacano speakers are found in Cavite City and Ternate. There are also speakers in some areas in the provinces of [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], Davao, and in Cotabato City. According to the official 2000 Philippine census, there were altogether 607,200 Chavacano speakers in the Philippines in that same year. The exact figure could be higher as the 2000 population of Zamboanga City, whose main language is Chavacano, far exceeded that census figure. Also, the figure doesn\u2019t include Chavacano speakers of the [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino diaspora]]. All the same, Zamboangue\u00f1o is the variety with the most number of speakers, being the official language of Zamboanga City whose population is now believed to be over a million; is also an official language in Basilan.\n\nChavacano speakers are also found in [[Semporna]] and elsewhere in Sabah as Sabah was under partial Spanish sovereignty and via Filipino refugees who escaped from [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] and predominantly Muslim areas of Mindanao like [[Sulu Archipelago]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Susanne Michaelis|title=Roots of Creole Structures: Weighing the Contribution of Substrates and Superstrates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPUeQLcGMOMC|year=2008|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-5255-6}}</ref>\n\nA small number of Zamboanga's indigenous peoples and of Basilan, such as the [[Taus\u016bg people|Tausug]]s, the [[Samal people|Samals]], and the [[Yakan]]s, majority of those people are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], also speak the language. In the close provinces of Sulu and [[Tawi-Tawi]] areas, there are Muslim speakers of the ''Chavacano de Zamboanga'', all of them are neighbors of Christians. Speakers of the ''Chavacano de Zamboanga'', both Christians and Muslims, also live in [[Lanao del Norte]] and [[Lanao del Sur]]. Christians and Muslims in [[Maguindanao]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Cotabato]], [[South Cotabato]], [[Cotabato City]], and [[Saranggani]] speak ''Chavacano de Zamboanga''. Take note that [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-tawi, [[Maguindanao]], [[Cotabato City]], [[Soccsksargen]] (region that composed of [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Cotabato]], [[South Cotabato]], and [[Saranggani]]) and Davao Region became part of short-lived [[Republic of Zamboanga]], which chose Chavacano as [[official language]].\n\n===Social significance===\nChavacano has been primarily and practically a spoken language. In the past, its use in literature was limited and chiefly local to the geographical location where the particular variety of the language was spoken. Its use as a spoken language far exceeds its use in literary work in comparison to the use of Spanish in the Philippines which was more successful as a written language than a spoken language. In recent years, there have been efforts to encourage the use of Chavacano as a written language, but the attempts were mostly minor attempts in folklore and religious literature and few pieces of written materials by the print media. In Zamboanga City, while the language is used by the mass media, the Catholic Church, education, and the local government, there have been few literary work written in Zamboangue\u00f1o and access to these resources by the general public isn\u2019t readily available; Bibles of Protestant Christians are also written in standard Chavacano. As Chavacano is spoken by Muslims as second language not only in Zamboanga City and Basilan but even in Sulu and Tawi-tawi, a number of [[Qur'an]] books are published in Chavacano.\n\nThe Zamboangue\u00f1o variety has been constantly evolving especially during half of the past century until the present. Zamboangue\u00f1o has been experiencing an infusion of English and more Tagalog words and from other languages worldwide in its vocabulary and there have been debates and discussions among older Chavacano speakers, new generation of Chavacano speakers, scholars, linguists, sociologists, historians, and educators regarding its preservation, cultivation, standardization, and its future as a Spanish-based creole. In 2000, The [[Instituto Cervantes]] in Manila hosted a conference entitled \"Shedding Light on the Chavacano Language\" at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. Starting school year 2012\u201313, the Zamboangue\u00f1o variant has also been taught at schools following the implementation of the Department of Education's policy of Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE). It serves as a medium of instruction from kindergarten to grade 3 and as a separate subject (Mother Tongue) from grades 1 to 3.\n\nBecause of the grammatical structures, Castilian usage, and archaic Spanish words and phrases that Chavacano (especially Zamboangue\u00f1o) uses, between speakers of both contemporary Spanish and Chavacano who are uninitiated, both languages appear to be non-intelligible to a large extent. For the initiated speakers, Chavacano can be intelligible to some Spanish speakers, and while most Spanish words can easily be understood by Chavacano speakers, many would struggle to understand a complete Spanish sentence.{{says who}}\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term '''Chavacano''' or '''Chabacano''' originated from the Spanish word ''{{wiktspa|chabacano}}'' which literally means \"poor taste\", \"vulgar\", \"common\", \"of low quality\", or \"coarse\". Chavacano has since evolved into a word of its own in different spellings with no negative connotation, but to simply being the name of the language itself.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, what is today called ''Chavacano'' was also called by the Spanish-speaking population as the \"''lenguaje de la calle''\", \"''lenguaje de parian''\" (language of the street), or \"''lenguaje de cocina''\" (kitchen Spanish) to refer to the Chabacano spoken by the people of Manila, particularly in Ermita) to distinguish it from the Spanish language spoken by those of the upper class, which consisted of Spaniards and educated Natives.\n\nLinguists use the term '''Philippine Creole Spanish''' which can be further divided into two geographic classifications: Manila Bay Creoles (which includes Ternate\u00f1o and Cavite\u00f1o) and Mindanao Creole (including Zamboangue\u00f1o). The varieties of the language are geographically related. The Manila Bay Creoles have Tagalog as their substrate language while The Mindanao Creoles have [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] (mostly [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Tausug language|Tausug]], and [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]), [[Subanon language|Subanon]], and [[Sama language|Sama]] as their substrate language(s). \n\nChavacano/Chabacano speakers themselves have different preferences on whether to spell the language with a V or a B.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Noun phrases in Creole languages : a multi-faceted approach|date=2007|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|others=Baptista, Marlyse., Gu\u00e9ron, Jacqueline.|isbn=9789027291820|location=Amsterdam|oclc=233632814}}</ref> They emphasise the difference between their variety and others using their own geographical location as a point of reference. Language speakers in Ternate also use the term Bahra to refer to their language and their city. Chavacano varieties usually have their area name attached to the language.\n\nIn Zamboanga City, most people are using the V in spelling the language as Chavacano. In the three-day Chavacano Orthography Congress held on Nov 19-21, 2014, wherein it included the presentation by researchers on Chavacano, mostly results from surveys conducted among selected respondents in the city, the newly organized Chavacano Orthography Council met with the officials of the Department of Education and agreed among others that the language is to be spelled with the V. Most people in support of this move would like to distance their language Chavacano to the word Chabacano which also means \u2018vulgar\u201d in Spanish.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Chavacano/Chabacano varieties and alternative names\n!Location\n!Geographical area\n!Alternative names and spellings\n|-\n|Zamboanga\n|Mindanao\n|Chavacano, Zamboangue\u00f1o, Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano\n|-\n|Cavite\n|Manila Bay\n|Chabacano de Cavite, Cavite\u00f1, Caviten, Linguaje de Niso\n|-\n|Basilan\n|Mindanao\n|Zamboangue\u00f1o, Chavacano de Zamboanga\n|-\n|Cotabato\n|Mindanao\n|Cotabate\u00f1, Cotabato Chavacano\n|-\n|Davao\n|Mindanao\n|Davaoe\u00f1o, Davaoe\u00f1o Zamboangue\u00f1o, Castellano Abakay, Davao Chavacano\n|-\n|Ermita\n|Manila Bay\n|Ermitense, Ermita Chabacano\n|-\n|Ternate\n|Manila Bay\n|Ternate\u00f1o, Ternate\u00f1o Chabacano, Bahra, Linguaje di Bahra\n|}\n\n==Historical background==\n\nThere is no definite conclusion on the precise history of how these different varieties of Chavacano developed.\n\nPrior to the formation of what is today the Philippines, what existed were a collection of various islands and different [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnolinguistic group]]s inhabiting them. The [[Spanish Colonisation of the Philippines|Spanish colonisation]] of the Philippine islands had led to the presence of the Spanish language in the islands. Though Spanish was the language of the government, the various languages originating and found in the islands remained the mother tongue of the various inhabitants. Instead of using Spanish to spread Christianity, Spanish missionaries preferred to learn the various local languages. With over 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, the Spanish language came to influence the various Philippine languages to varying degrees by way of aspects like new loanwords and expressions.\n\nCreole languages (such as [[French-based creole]]s) have formed at various points in time around the world due to colonialism. As a result of contact between speakers of two mutually non-intelligible languages, creole languages have evolved in some cases to facilitate communication. This usually involves taking the vocabulary of another language and grammatical features of the native language. In contrast to the numerous French-based creole languages, only three creole languages have been found to be Spanish-based or heavily influenced: [[Papiamento]], [[Palenquero]], and Chavacano. In the Philippines, a major difficulty in tracing the development of Chabacano is the confusion attributed to in accounts of travelers to the Philippines between a coherent creole language, `broken Spanish', and fluent Spanish.<ref>Lipski, J. M. Chabacano/Spanish and the Philippine linguistic identity.</ref> The earliest believed attestation of a coherent creole language spoken in Cavite City comes from the Augustinian priest Mart\u00ednez de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga who in his 1803 accounts of his travels in the Philippines, ''Estadismos de las Islas Filipinas'', notes that \"In Cavite and in its suburb of San Roque, a very corrupted Spanish is spoken, whose phraseology is entirely taken from the language of the country\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Mentions of a vernacular referred to as \"kitchen Spanish\" and \"language of the market\" (referring to the Manila variety), or other terms are found in a number of texts of the 19th century. However, the kind of vernacular referred to by these terms are imprecise and these terms may refer to a fully fledged creole or to a Spanish-pidgin spoken by Chinese and Filipino merchants.\n\nThe manner of formation of this type of speech found in a number of communities around the Philippines remains unclear today. A sample of what is today called ''Chabacano'' may be found in dialogues contained in chapters 18 (''Supercher\u00edas'') and 28 (''Tatakut'') of Filipino writer [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s 1891 work ''[[El Filibusterismo]]''.<ref>text reproduced by [https://filipinoscribbles.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/chabacano-in-el-filibusterismo/ Filipino Scribbles]</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.angelfire.com/art2/roger_santos/rizal.html | title=Chabacano - Cavite's Dialect}}</ref> The dialogue found in chapter 18 is:\n\n{{quote|''\u00bfPorque ba no di pod\u00ed nis\u00f3s entr\u00e1?'' preguntaba una voz de mujer.\n\n\u2015''Ab\u00e1, \u00f1ora, porque \u2018tall\u00e1 el man\u00e1 prailes y el man\u00e1 empleau'', contest\u00f3 un hombre; ''\u2018ta jas\u00ed solo para il\u00f3s el cabesa de espinge''.\n\n\u2015''\u00a1Curioso tambi\u00e9n el man\u00e1 prailes!'' dijo la voz de mujer alej\u00e1ndose; ''\u00a1no quiere pa que di sab\u00e9 nisos cuando ilos ta sali inga\u00f1au! \u00a1Cosa! \u00a1Querida be de praile el cabesa!''}}\n\nIn the 1883 work of German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]] ''Uber das Malaiospanische der Philippinen'', he presents fragments of texts and comments of what he calls \"Malayo-Spanish\". However, the first to give a general study and investigation of the varieties of Chavacano as a group was by Keith Whinnom in his 1956 work ''The Spanish Contact Vernaculars in the Philippine Islands ''. Whinnom gives an overall view of the history and grammar of what he calls \"Ermita\u00f1o\" of Ermita in Manila, \"Cavite\u00f1o\" of Cavite and \"Zamboangue\u00f1o\" of Zamboanga. In it, he also postulated his [[Monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] on the origin of these vernaculars.\n\nLinguists are unsettled on how these vernaculars formed and how they connect to one another, if any. There are many theories but the two main theories of the origin of Chavacano are: Whinnom's \"monogenetic theory\" and a \"parallel-development\" theory proposed by Frake in 1971.\n\n===Monogenetic theory===\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\nAccording to the Monogentic theory or one-way theory advanced by Whinnom, all varieties of Chavacano result from a single source and that varieties are related to each other.\n\n===Parallel-development theory===\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\nThe parallel development theory or two-way theory as advocated by Frake in 1971, the variants found in Luzon and Mindanao had evolved autonomously from each other.\n\n===Zamboangue\u00f1o===\n\nOn 23 June 1635, [[Zamboanga City]] became a permanent foothold of the Spanish government with the construction of the [[Fort Pilar|San Jos\u00e9 Fortress]]. Bombardment and harassment from pirates and raiders of the sultans of [[Mindanao]] and [[Jolo]] and the determination to spread Christianity further south (as Zamboanga was a crucial strategic location) of the Philippines forced the Spanish missionary friars to request reinforcements from the colonial government.\n\nThe military authorities decided to import labour from Luzon and the Visayas. Thus, the construction workforce eventually consisted of Spanish, Mexican and Peruvian soldiers, masons from Cavite (who comprised the majority), sacadas from Cebu and Iloilo, and those from the various local tribes of Zamboanga like the Samals and Subanons.\n\nLanguage differences made it difficult for one ethnic group to communicate with another. To add to this, work instructions were issued in Spanish. The majority of the workers were unschooled and therefore did not understand Spanish but needed to communicate with each other and the Spaniards. A [[pidgin]] developed and became a full-fledged [[creole language]] still in use today as a [[lingua franca]] and/or as [[official language]], mainly in [[Zamboanga City]].\n\nWhen the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] gave up its territories in [[Sulu Archipelago]] to Spain within late 1700s (Sulu Sultanate gave up Basilan to Spain in 1762, while Sulu and Tawi-tawi were not given up by sultanate because the Sulu Sultanate only recognised partial Spanish sovereignty to Sulu and Tawi-tawi), Spanish settlers and soldiers brought the language to the region until Spain, [[Germany]], and [[United Kingdom]] signed an agreement named the [[Madrid Protocol of 1885]] that recognised Spanish rule of Sulu Archipelago. Chavacano becomes a lingua franca of Sulu Archipelago (composing of Sulu, Tawi-tawi, Basilan); although North Borneo (now Sabah) is not included on the [[Spanish East Indies]] area as stated on the Protocol and control by the [[United Kingdom]], Chavacano has still a little impact in Semporna.\n\nFrom then on, constant Spanish military reinforcements as well as increased presence of Spanish religious and educational institutions have fostered the Spanish creole.\n\n===Cavite\u00f1o / Ternate\u00f1o{{anchor|Cavite\u00f1o}}===\nThe [[Merdicas]] (also spelled Mardicas or Mardikas) were [[Catholic]] natives of the islands of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] of the [[Moluccas]] in the vicinity of [[New Guinea]], converted during the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] occupation of the islands by [[Jesuit]] missionaries. The islands were later captured by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] who vied for their control with the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]]. In 1663, the Spanish garrison in Ternate were forced to pull out to defend [[Manila]] against an impending invasion by the Chinese pirate [[Koxinga]] (sacrificing the Moluccas to the Dutch in doing so). A number of Merdicas volunteered to help, eventually being resettled in a sandbar near the mouth of the [[Maragondon]] river (known as the ''Barra de Maragondon'') and [[Tanza, Cavite]], Manila.<ref name=\"lipski\">{{cite book|author=John.

The Merdicas community eventually integrated into the local population. Today, the place is called [[Ternate, Cavite|Ternate]] after the island of Ternate in the Moluccas, and the descendants of the Merdicas continue to use their Spanish creole (with Portuguese influence) which came to be known as Cavite\u00f1o or Ternate\u00f1o Chavacano.<ref name=\"lipski\"/>\n\n==Samples==\n\n===Zamboangue\u00f1o===\n\n;Donde tu hay anda?\n:Spanish: \u00bfA d\u00f3nde vas?\n: (\u2018Where are you going?\u2019)\n;Ya mir\u00e1 yo con Jos\u00e9.\n:Spanish: Yo vi a Jos\u00e9.\n: (\u2018I saw Jos\u00e9.\u2019)\n;Ya empez\u00e1 ele busc\u00e1 que busc\u00e1 entero lugar con el sal.\n:Spanish: El/Ella empez\u00f3 a buscar la sal en todas partes.\n: (\u2018He/She began to search everywhere for the salt.\u2019)\n;Ya and\u00e1 ele na escuela.\n:Spanish: El/Ella se fue a la escuela.\n: (\u2018He/She went to school.\u2019)\n;Si Mario ya dorm\u00ed na casa.\n:Spanish: Mario durmi\u00f3 en la casa.\n: (\u2018Mario slept in the house.\u2019)\n;El hombre, con quien ya man encuentro tu, es mi hermano.\n:Spanish: El hombre que encontraste, es mi hermano.\n:(The man [whom] you met is my brother.)\n;El persona con quien tu tan cuento, bien alegre gayot.\n:Spanish: La persona con la que est\u00e1s hablando es muy alegre. / La persona con quien t\u00fa est\u00e1s conversando es bien alegre.\n: (The person you are talking to is very happy indeed.)\n:\n\n====Another sample of Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano\n!Spanish\n!English\n|-\n|Treinta y cuatro kilometro desde el pueblo de Zamboanga el Bunguiao, un diutay barrio que estaba un desierto.

Broadly speaking, the formal register is closer to Spanish, and the colloquial register to the local Austronesian languages.\n\nIn the common, colloquial, vulgar or familiar register/sociolect, words of local origin or a mixture of local and Spanish words predominate. The common or familiar register is used ordinarily when conversing with people of equal or lower status in society. It is also used more commonly in the family, with friends and acquaintances. Its use is of general acceptance and usage.\n\nIn the formal register/sociolect, words of Spanish origin or Spanish words predominate. The formal register is used especially when conversing with people of higher status in society. It is also used when conversing with elders (especially in the family and with older relatives) and those in authority. It is more commonly used by older generations, by Zamboangue\u00f1o mestizos, and in the barrios. It is the form used in speeches, education, media, and writing. The formal register used in conversation is sometimes mixed with some degree of colloquial register.\n\nThe following examples show a contrast between the usage of formal words and common or familiar words in Chavacano:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Chavacano (formal)\n!Chavacano (common/colloquial/vulgar/familiar)\n!Spanish\n|-\n|slippery\n|resbalozo/resbaladizo\n|malandug\n|resbaloso/resbaladizo\n|-\n|rice\n|morisqueta\n|kanon/arroz\n|morisqueta (understood as a Filipino rice dish)/arroz\n|-\n|rain\n|lluvia/aguacero\n|aguacero/ulan\n|lluvia/aguacero\n|-\n|dish\n|vianda/comida\n|comida/ulam\n|vianda/comida\n|-\n|braggart/boastful\n|orgulloso(a)\n|bugalon(a)/ hambuguero(a)\n|orgulloso(a)\n|-\n|car\n|coche\n|auto\n|auto/coche\n|-\n|housemaid\n|muchacho (m)/muchacha (f)\n|ayudanta (female); ayudante (male)\n|muchacha(o)/ayudante\n|-\n|father\n|pap\u00e1 (tata)\n|p\u00e1pang (tata)\n|pap\u00e1 (padre)\n|-\n|mother\n|mam\u00e1 (nana)\n|m\u00e1mang (nana)\n|mam\u00e1 (madre)\n|-\n|grandfather\n|abuelo\n|abuelo/lolo\n|abuelo/lolo\n|-\n|grandmother\n|abuela\n|abuela/lola\n|abuela/lela\n|-\n|small\n|chico(a)/peque\u00f1o(a)\n|peque\u00f1o(a)/diutay\n|peque\u00f1o/chico\n|-\n|nuisance\n|fastidio\n|asarante / salawayun\n|fastidio\n|-\n|hard-headed\n|testarudo\n|duro cabeza/duro pulso\n|testarudo/cabeza dura\n|-\n|slippers\n|chancla\n|chinelas\n|chancla/chinelas\n|-\n|married\n|de estado/de estao\n|casado/casao\n|casado\n|-\n|(my) parents\n|(mis) padres\n|(mi) tata'y nana\n|(mis) padres\n|-\n|naughty\n|travieso(a)\n|guachi / guachinanggo(a)\n|travieso(a)\n|-\n|slide\n|rezbalasa/deslizar\n|landug\n|resbalar/deslizar\n|-\n|ugly\n|feo (masculine)/fea (feminine)\n|malacara, malacuka\n|feo(a)\n|-\n|rainshower\n|lluve\n|tal\u00edtih\n|lluvia\n|-\n|lightning\n|rayo\n|rayo/quirlat\n|rayo\n|-\n|thunder/thunderstorm\n|trueno\n|trueno\n|trueno\n|-\n|tornado\n|tornado/remolino, remulleno\n|ipo-ipo\n|tornado/remolino\n|-\n|thin (person)\n|delgado(a)/flaco(a)/chiquito(a)\n|flaco/flaquit\n|delgado/flaco/flaquito\n|}\n\n==Writing system==\n{{contradiction|Are there 29 or 30 letters--is <rr> a letter?|date=January 2016}}\n\nChavacano is written using the [[Latin script]]. As Chavacano has mostly been a [[spoken language]] than a written one, multiple ways of writing the different varieties of Chavacano exist. Most published Chavacano texts utilize spelling systems nearly identical to Spanish, adjusting certain spellings of words to reflect how they are pronounced by native Chavacano speakers. Since the propagation of the usage of the [[Filipino language]] in education and the media as the national language, Filipino's orthography has affected how certain persons might spell Chavacano, especially since recent generations have grown unfamiliar with Spanish orthography; Most published works, and the general media, however more often retain Spanish-based spelling systems.\n\nThe kind of writing system used to write Chavacano may differ according to the writer of the text. Writing may be written using a Spanish-derived writing system, where all words (including words of local origin) are spelled adhering to basic Spanish orthographic rules; it may also be written \"phonetically\", similar to the modern orthography of Filipino; another writing style uses a mixture of the two, spelling words based on an etymological approach, using phonetic spelling for words of Filipino origin and Spanish spelling rules for words of Spanish origin.\n\nin Zamboanga, an etymological-based approach was formally recently endorsed by the local city government and this is the system used in public schools as part of the mother-tongue policy of the Department of Education for kindergarten to grade 3. In principle, words of Spanish origin are to be spelled using Spanish rules while Chavacano words of local origin are spelled in the manner according to their origin. Thus, the letter ''k'' appear mostly in words of [[Austronesian]] origin or in loanwords from other Philippine languages (words such as ''kame'', ''kita'', ''kanamon'', ''kaninyo'').\n<!--Unsourced:\nSome additional characters like the ''\u00f1'' (''e\u00f1e'', representing the phoneme {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, a letter distinct from ''n'' but typographically composed of an ''n'' with a [[tilde]]), the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ch'' ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}), the ''ll'' ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}}), and the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''rr'' ({{lang|es|erre}} with strong ''r'') exist in Chavacano.-->\n\nIt is uncommon in modern written works to include the [[acute accent]] and the [[trema (diacritic)|trema]] in writing except in linguistic or highly formalized texts. Also, the letters ''\u00f1'' and ''ll'' are sometimes replaced by ''ny'' and ''ly'' in informal texts.\n\n===Alphabet===\n\nThe Chavacano alphabet has 30 letters, including <ch>, <ll>, <\u00f1> and <rr>:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Languages of the Southern Gateway: Chavacano, Sinama, Tausug, Yakan|last=Department of Education, Culture and Sports and The Summer Institute of Linguistics|publisher=The Summer Institute of Linguistics|year=1979|isbn=978-9711801311|location=Manila, Philippines|pages=}}</ref>\n\n'''a''', '''b''', '''c''', '''ch''', '''d''', '''e''', '''f''', '''g''', '''h''', '''i''', '''j''', '''k''', '''l''', '''ll''', '''m''', '''n''', '''\u00f1''', '''o''', '''p''', '''q''', '''r''', '''rr''', '''s''', '''t''', '''u''', '''v''', '''w''', '''x''', '''y''', '''z'''\n\n====Letters and letter names====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | A a || style=\"width: 17em;\" | '''a''' {{IPA|/a/}}\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | J j || style=\"width: 20em;\" | '''jota''' {{IPA|/\u02c8xota/}}\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | R r || style=\"width: 25em;\" | '''ere''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u027ee/}}\n|-\n| B b || '''be''' {{IPA|/be/}}<br>\n| K k || '''ka''' {{IPA|/ka/}}\n| Rr rr || '''erre''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ere/}}\n|-\n| C c || '''ce'''  {{IPA|/se/}}\n| L l || '''ele''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ele/}}\n| S s || '''ese''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ese/}}\n|-\n| Ch ch || '''che''' {{IPA|/t\u0283e/}}\n| Ll ll || '''elle''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u028ee/}}\n| T t || '''te''' {{IPA|/te/}}\n|-\n| D d || '''de''' {{IPA|/de/}}\n| M m || '''eme''' {{IPA|/\u02c8eme/}}\n| U u || '''u''' {{IPA|/u/}}\n|-\n| E e || '''e''' {{IPA|/e/}}\n| N n || '''ene''' {{IPA|/ene/}}\n| V v || '''uve''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ube/}}\n|-\n| F f || '''efe''' {{IPA|/\u02c8efe/}}\n| \u00d1 \u00f1 || '''e\u00f1e''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u0272e/}}\n| W w || '''doble u''' {{IPA|/\u02c8uve doble/}}<br>\n|-\n| G g || '''ge''' {{IPA|/xe/}}\n| O o || '''o''' {{IPA|/o/}}\n| X x || '''equis''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ekis/}}\n|-\n| H h || '''hache''' {{IPA|/\u02c8at\u0283e/}}\n| P p || '''pe''' {{IPA|/pe/}}\n| Y y || '''ye''' {{IPA|/\u025f\u029de/}}<br>\n|-\n| I i || '''i''' {{IPA|/i/}}<br>\n| Q q || '''cu''' {{IPA|/ku/}}\n| Z z || '''zeta''' {{IPA|/\u02c8seta/}}<br>'''zeda''' {{IPA|/\u02c8seda/}}\n|}\n\nOther letter combinations include ''rr'' (erre), which is pronounced {{IPA|/xr/}} or {{IPA|/r/}}, and ''ng,'' which is pronounced {{IPA|/\u014b\u0261/}}. Another combination was ''\u00f1g,'' which was pronounced {{IPA|/\u014b/}} but is now obsolete and is only written as ''ng''.\n\nSome sounds are not represented in the Chavacano written language. These sounds are mostly in words of Philippine and foreign origin. Furthermore, the pronunciation of some words of Spanish origin have become distorted or Philippinized in modern Chavacano. Some vowels have become allophonized ('e' and 'o' becomes 'i' and 'u' in some words) and some consonants have changed their pronunciation. (i.e. ''escoger'' became ''iscuj\u00ed'' in informal speech; ''tiene'' {{IPA|/t\u0283\u025bn\u025b/}}; ''Dios'' {{IPA|/d\u0292\u0254s/}}; ''Castilla'' became {{IPA|/kastilla/}} instead of {{IPA|/kasti\u028ea/}}).\n\nGlottal stops, as in Filipino languages, are not also indicated (\u00e2, \u00ea, \u00ee, \u00f4, \u00fb). These sounds are mainly found in words of Philippine origin and are only indicated in dictionaries (i.e. jend\u00ea = not; ol\u00ea = again) and when they are, the circumflex accent is used.\n\nOther pronunciation changes in some words of Spanish origin include:\n\n: f ~ {{IPA|/p/}}\n: j, g (before 'e' and 'i') ~ /{{IPA|h}}/ (in common with dialects of [[Caribbean Spanish|Caribbean]] and other areas of [[Spanish language in the Americas|Latin America]] and [[Andalusian Spanish|southern Spain]])\n: ch ~ {{IPA|/ts/}}\n: rr ~ {{IPA|/xr/}}\n: di, de ~ {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} (when followed or preceded by other vowels: Dios ~ /jos/ ; dejalo ~ /jalo/)\n: ti, te ~ {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} (when followed or preceded by other vowels: tierra ~ /chehra/; tiene ~ /chene/)\n: ci, si ~ {{IPA|/\u0283/}}  (when followed or preceded by other vowels: conciencia ~ /kon\u0283en\u0283a/)\n\n[b, d, g] between vowels which are [[fricatives|fricative]] [[allophones]] are pronounced as they are in Chavacano.\n\n===Other sounds===\n\n: -h {{IPA|/h/}} (glottal fricative in the final position); sometimes not written\n: -g {{IPA|/k/}}; sometimes written as just -k\n: -d {{IPA|/t/}}; sometimes written as just -t\n: -kh [{{IPA link|x}}]; only in loanwords of Arabic origin, mostly Islamic terms\n\n===Sounds from English===\n\n: \u201cv\u201d pronounced as English \u201cv\u201d (like: vase) (vi)\n: \u201cz\u201d pronounced as English \u201cz\u201d (like: zebra)  (zi)\n: \u201cx\u201d pronounced as English \u201cx\u201d (like: X-ray)  (ex/eks)\n: \u201ch\u201d like: house (/eitsh/); sometimes written as 'j'\n\n===Diphthongs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Letters\n!Pronunciation\n!Example\n!Significant\n|-\n|'''ae'''\n| aye\n| ca\u00e9\n| fall, to fall\n|-\n|'''ai'''\n| ay\n| caido\n| fallen, fell\n|-\n|'''ao'''\n| aow\n| cuidao\n| take care, cared\n|-\n|'''ea'''\n| eya\n| pat\u00e9a\n| kick, to kick\n|-\n|'''ei'''\n| ey\n| re\u00ed\n| laugh\n|-\n|'''eo'''\n| eyo\n| v\u00eddeo\n| video\n|-\n|'''ia'''\n| ya\n| advertencia\n| warning, notice\n|-\n|'''ie'''\n| ye\n| cien(to)\n| one hundred, hundred\n|-\n|'''io'''\n| yo\n| canci\u00f3n\n| song\n|-\n|'''iu'''\n| yu\n| saci\u00fat\n| to move the hips a little\n|-\n|'''uo'''\n| ow\n| institutuo\n| institute\n|-\n|'''qu'''\n| ke\n| qu\u00e9, que\n| what, that, than\n|-\n|'''gu'''\n| strong g\n| gu\u00eda\n| to guide, guide\n|-\n|'''ua'''\n| wa\n| agua\n| water\n|-\n|'''ue'''\n| we\n| cuento\n| story\n|-\n|'''ui'''\n| wi\n| cuid\u00e1\n| care, to take care\n|-\n|'''oi'''\n| oy\n| o\u00ed\n| hear, to hear\n|}\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Simple sentence structure (verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order)===\n\nChavacano is a language with the [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] sentence order. This is because it follows the Hiligaynon or Tagalog grammatical structures. However, the [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] order does exist in Chavacano but only for emphasis purposes (see below). New generations have been slowly and vigorously using the S-V-O pattern mainly because of the influence of the English language. These recent practices have been most prevalent and evident in the mass media particularly among Chavacano newswriters who translate news leads from English or Tagalog to Chavacano where the \"who\" is emphasized more than the \"what\". Because the mass media represent \"legitimacy\", it is understood by Chavacano speakers (particularly Zamboangue\u00f1os) that the S-V-O sentence structure used by Chavacano journalists is standardized.\n\n====Declarative affirmative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====\n\nChavacano generally follows the simple verb\u2013subject\u2013object or verb\u2013object\u2013subject sentence structure typical of Hiligaynon or Tagalog in declarative affirmative sentences:\n\n:'''Ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object).\n:'''Ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''tierra''' (object) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject).\n::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) ang mga manogbaligya (subject) sang duta (object).\n::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) sang duta (object) ang mga manogbaligya (subject).\n::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ang mga negosyante (subject) ng lupa (object).\n::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ng lupa (object) ang mga negosyante (subject).\n:::(\u2018The businessmen are buying land.\u2019)\n\nThe subject always appears after the verb, and in cases where pronominal subjects (such as personal pronouns) are used in sentences, they will never occur before the verb:\n\n:'''Ya and\u00e1 yo na iglesia enantes'''.\n::(\u2018I went to church a while ago.\u2019)\n\n====Declarative negative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====\n\nWhen the predicate of the sentence is negated, Chavacano uses the words '''jendeh''' (from Tagalog \u2019hindi\u2019 or Hiligaynon 'indi' which means \u2019no\u2019; the Cebuano uses 'dili', which shows its remoteness from Chavacano as compared to Hiligaynon) to negate the verb in the present tense, '''no hay''' (which literally means \u2019none\u2019) to negate the verb that was supposed to happen in the past, and '''jend\u00eah''' or '''nunca''' (which means \u2019no\u2019 or \u2019never\u2019) to negate the verb that will not or will never happen in the future respectively. This manner of negating the predicate always happens in the verb\u2013subject\u2013object or verb\u2013object\u2013subject sentence structure:\n\nPresent Tense\n\n:'''Jend\u00eah ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object).\n:'''Jend\u00eah ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''tierra''' (object) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject).\n::(Eng: The businessmen are not buying land.

Span: el hombre de negocio nunca comprar\u00e1 terreno)\n\n===Nouns and articles===\n\nThe Chavacano definite article '''el''' precedes a singular noun or a plural marker (for a plural noun). The indefinite article '''un''' stays constant for gender as 'una' has almost completely disappeared in Chavacano, except for some phrases like \"una vez\". It also stays constant for number as for singular nouns. In Chavacano, it is quite common for '''el''' and '''un''' to appear together before a singular noun, the former to denote certainty and the latter to denote number:\n\n:'''el caj\u00f3n''' (\u2019the box\u2019) \u2013 '''el maga/mana caj\u00f3n(es)''' (\u2019the boxes\u2019)\n:'''un soltero''' (\u2019a bachelor\u2019) \u2013 '''un soltera''' (\u2019a spinster\u2019)\n:'''el un soltero''' (\u2019the bachelor\u2019) \u2013 '''el un soltera''' (\u2019the spinster\u2019)\n\nNouns in Chavacano are not always preceded by articles. Without an article, a noun is a generic reference:\n\n:'''Jendeh yo ta llor\u00e1 lagrimas sino sangre'''.\n::(\u2019I do not cry tears but blood\u2019.)\n:'''Ta carg\u00e1 yo palo'''.\n::(\u2019I am carrying wood\u2019).\n\nProper names of persons are preceded by the definite article '''si''' or the phrase '''un tal''' functioning as an indefinite article would:\n\n:'''Un bonita candidata si Maria.'''.\n::(\u2019Maria is a beautiful candidate\u2019.)\n:'''un tal Juancho'''\n::(\u2019a certain Juancho\u2019)\n\n====Singular nouns====\n\nUnlike in Spanish, Chavacano [[nouns]] derived from Spanish do not follow gender rules in general. In Zamboangue\u00f1o, the [[article (grammar)|article]] 'el' basically precedes every singular noun. However, this rule is not rigid (especially in Zamboangue\u00f1o) because the formal vocabulary mode wherein Spanish words predominate almost always is the preferred mode especially in writing. The Spanish article 'la' for feminine singular nouns does exist in Chavacano, though it occurs rarely and mostly in the formal medium of writing, such as poems and lyrics. When accompanying a Spanish feminine noun, the 'la' as the article is more tolerated than acceptable.  Among the few exceptions where the 'la' occurs is as a formal prefix when addressing the Blessed Virgin Mary, perhaps more as an emphasis of her importance in Christian devotion. But the real article is still the 'el', which makes this use of a \"double article\" quite unique. Thus it is common to hear the Blessed Virgin addressed in Chavacano as 'el La Virgen Maria' (the \"L\" of the 'la' capitalized to signify its permanent position within the noun compound). In general, though, when in doubt, the article 'el' is always safe to use. Compare:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English singular noun\n!Chavacano singular noun (general and common)\n!Chavacano singular noun (accepted or uncommon)\n|-\n|the virgin\n|el virgen\n|la virgen (accepted)\n|-\n|the peace\n|el paz\n|la paz (accepted)\n|-\n|the sea\n|el mar\n|la mar (accepted)\n|-\n|the cat\n|el gato\n|el gato (la gata is uncommon)\n|-\n|the sun\n|el sol\n|el sol\n|-\n|the moon\n|el luna\n|el luna (la luna is uncommon)\n|-\n|the view\n|el vista\n|la vista (accepted)\n|-\n|the tragedy\n|el tragedia\n|el tragedia (la tragedia is uncommon)\n|-\n|the doctor\n|el doctor\n|el doctora (la doctora is uncommon)\n|}\n\nAnd just like Spanish, Chavacano nouns can have gender but only when referring to persons. However, they are always masculine in the sense (Spanish context) that they are generally preceded by the article 'el'. Places and things are almost always masculine. The -o is dropped in masculine nouns and -a is added to make the noun feminine:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English singular noun\n!Chavacano singular noun (masculine)\n!Chavacano singular noun (feminine)\n|-\n|the teacher\n|el maestro\n|el maestra\n|-\n|the witch\n|el burujo\n|el buruja\n|-\n|the engineer\n|el engeniero\n|el engeniera\n|-\n|the tailor/seamstress\n|el sastrero\n|el sastrera\n|-\n|the baby\n|el ni\u00f1o\n|el ni\u00f1a\n|-\n|the priest/nun\n|el padre / sacerdote\n|el madre / monja\n|-\n|the grandson/granddaughter\n|el nieto\n|el nieta\n|-\n|the professor\n|el profesor\n|el profesora\n|-\n|the councilor\n|el consejal\n|el consejala\n|}\n\nNot all nouns referring to persons can become feminine nouns. In Chavacano, some names of persons are masculine (because of the preceding article 'el' in Spanish context) but do not end in -o.\n\n:Examples: '''el alcalde''', '''el capitan''', '''el negociante''', '''el ayudante''', '''el chufer'''\n\nAll names of animals are always masculine\u2014in Spanish context\u2014preceded by the article 'el'.\n\n:Examples: '''el gato''' (gata is uncommon), '''el puerco''' (puerca is uncommon), '''el perro''' (perra is uncommon)\n\nNames of places and things can be either masculine or feminine, but they are considered masculine in the Spanish context because the article 'el' always precedes the noun:\n\n:'''el cocina''', '''el pantal\u00f3n''', '''el comida''', '''el camino''', '''el trapo''', '''el ventana''', '''el mar'''\n\n====Plural nouns====\n\nIn Chavacano, plural nouns (whether masculine or feminine in Spanish context) are preceded by the retained singular masculine Spanish article 'el'. The Spanish articles 'los' and 'las' have almost disappeared. They have been replaced by the modifier (a plural marker) 'maga/mana' which precedes the singular form of the noun. Maga comes from the native Hiligaynon 'maga' or the Tagalog 'mga'. The formation of the Chavacano plural form of the noun (el + maga/mana + singular noun form) applies whether in common, familiar or formal mode. It may be thought of as roughly equivalent to saying in English, \"the many (noun)\" instead of \"the (noun)s\", and in fact \"the many (noun)s\" is used more in [[Philippine English]] than elsewhere.\n\nThere are some Chavacano speakers (especially older Cavite\u00f1o or Zamboangue\u00f1o speakers) who would tend to say 'mana' for 'maga'. 'Mana' is accepted and quite common, especially among older speakers, but when in doubt, the modifier 'maga' to pluralize nouns is safer to use.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English plural noun\n!Chavacano plural noun (masculine)\n!Chavacano plural noun (feminine)\n|-\n|the teachers\n|el maga/mana maestro(s)\n|el maga/mana maestra(s)\n|-\n|the witches\n|el maga/mana burujo(s)\n|el maga/mana buruja(s)\n|-\n|the engineers\n|el maga/mana engeniero(s)\n|el maga/mana engeniera(s)\n|-\n|the tailors/seamstresses\n|el maga/mana sastrero(s)\n|el maga/mana sastrera(s)\n|-\n|the babies\n|el maga/mana ni\u00f1o(s)\n|el maga/mana ni\u00f1a(s)\n|-\n|the priests/nuns\n|el maga/mana padre(s)\n|el maga/mana madre(s)\n|-\n|the grandsons/granddaughters\n|el maga/mana nieto(s)\n|el maga/mana nieta(s)\n|-\n|the professors\n|el maga/mana professor(es)\n|el maga/mana profesora(s)\n|-\n|the councilors\n|el maga/mana consejal(es)\n|el maga/mana consejala(s)\n|}\n\nAgain, this rule is not rigid (especially in the Zamboangue\u00f1o formal mode). The articles 'los' or 'las' do exist sometimes before nouns that are pluralized in the Spanish manner, and their use is quite accepted:\n\n:'''los caballeros''', '''los dias''', '''las noches''', '''los chavacanos''', '''los santos''', '''las ma\u00f1anas''', '''las almujadas''', '''las mesas''', '''las plumas''', '''las cosas'''\n\nWhen in doubt, it is always safe to use 'el' and 'maga or mana' to pluralize singular nouns:\n\n:'''el maga/mana caballero(s)''', '''el maga/mana d\u00eda(s)''', '''el maga/mana noche(s)''', '''el maga/mana chavacano(s)''', '''el maga/mana santo(s)''', '''el maga/mana d\u00eda(s) que viene''' (this is a phrase; 'el maga/mana ma\u00f1ana' is uncommon), '''el maga/mana almujada(s)''', '''el maga/mana mesa(s)''', '''el maga/mana pluma(s)'''\n\nIn Chavacano, it is common for some nouns to become doubled when pluralized (called ''[[Reduplication]]'', a characteristic of the Malayo-Polynesian family of languages):\n\n:'''el maga cosa-cosa''' (el maga cosa/s is common), '''el maga casa casa''' (el maga casa is common), '''el maga gente gente''' (el maga gente is common), '''el maga juego juego''' (el maga juego is common)\n\nBut note that in some cases, this \"reduplication\" signifies a difference in meaning.  For example,  'el maga bata' means 'the children' but 'el maga bata-bata' means one's followers or subordinates, as is a gang or mob.\n\nIn general, the suffixes -s, -as, -os to pluralize nouns in Spanish have also almost disappeared in Chavacano. However, the formation of plural nouns with suffixes ending in -s, -as, and -os are accepted. Basically, the singular form of the noun is retained, and it becomes plural because of the preceding modifier/plural marker 'maga' or 'mana':\n\n:'''el maga/mana caballeros''' (accepted)\n:'''el maga/mana caballero''' (correct)\n:'''el maga/mana d\u00edas''' (accepted)\n:'''el maga/mana d\u00eda''' (correct)\n\nAdding the suffix -es to some nouns is quite common and accepted. Nouns ending in -cion can also be pluralized by adding the suffix -es:\n\n:'''el maga meses''', '''el maga mujeres''', '''el maga mayores''', '''el maga tentaciones''', '''el maga contestaciones''', '''el maga naciones''', '''el maga organizaciones'''\n\nHowever, it is safer to use the general rule (when in doubt) of retaining the singular form of the noun preceded by the modifier/plural marker 'maga' or 'mana':\n\n:'''el maga mes''', '''el maga mujer''', '''el maga mayor''', '''el maga tentaci\u00f3n''', '''el maga contestaci\u00f3n''', '''el maga naci\u00f3n''', '''el maga organizaci\u00f3n'''\n\n===Pronouns===\n\nChavacano pronouns are based on Spanish and native sources; many of the pronouns are not used in either but may be derived in part.\n\nIn contrast to the other varieties of Chavacano, the variety spoken in Zamboanga uses more pronouns derived from a native Philippine language (I.e. Hiligaynon) in addition to Spanish. In Zamboangue\u00f1o, there are three different levels of usage for certain pronouns depending on the level of familiarity between the speaker and the addressee, the status of both in family and society, or the mood of the speaker and addressee at the particular moment: ''common'', ''familiar'', and ''formal''. The common forms are, particularly in the second and third person plural, derived from Cebuano while most familiar and formal forms are from Spanish. The ''common forms'' are used to address a person below or of equal social or family status or to someone is who is acquainted. The common forms are used to regard no formality or courtesy in conversation. Its use can also mean rudeness, impoliteness or offensiveness. The ''familiar forms'' are used to address someone of equal social or family status. It indicates courteousness, and is commonly used in public conversations, the broadcast media, and in education. The ''formal forms'' are used to address someone older and/or higher in social or family status. It is the form used in writing.\n\nAdditionally, Zamboangue\u00f1o is the only variety of Chavacano which distinguishes between the [[inclusive and exclusive we|inclusive we]] (''kita'') \u2013 including the person spoken to (the addressee) \u2013 and the [[inclusive and exclusive we|exclusive we]] (''kame'') \u2013 excluding the person spoken to (the addressee) \u2013 in the first person plural except in the formal form where ''nosotros'' is used for both.\n\n====Personal (nominative/subjective case) pronouns====\n\nBelow is a table comparing the personal pronouns in three varieties of Chavacano.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o\n!Cavite\u00f1\n!Bahra\n!Castellano Abakay (de Davao)\n|-\n|'''1st person singular'''\n|yo\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | yo\n|yo (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\nako (Chino)\n|-\n|'''2nd person singular'''\n|[e]vo[s] (common)/(informal)<br>t\u00fa (familiar)<br>usted (formal)\n|vo/bo<br>tu<br>ust\u00e9\n|vo/bo<br>ust\u00e9\n|usted\nvos\n|-\n|'''3rd person singular'''\n|\u00e9l<br>ele\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | eli\n|\u00e9l\n|-\n|'''1st person plural'''\n|kam\u00e9 (exclusive/common/familiar)<br>kit\u00e1 (inclusive/common/familiar)<br>nosotros (formal)\n|nisos\n|mijotro<br>mihotro<br>motro\n|nosotros (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\n|-\n|'''2nd person plural'''\n|kam\u00f3 (common)<br> vosotros (familiar)<br> ustedes (formal)\n|vusos<br>busos\n|buhotro<br>bujotro<br>ustedi<br>tedi\n|ustedes\nvosotros\n|-\n|'''3rd person plural'''\n|sil\u00e1 (common/familiar)<br>ellos (formal)\n|ilos\n|lojotro<br>lohotro<br>lotro\n|ellos\n|}\n\n====Possessive pronouns (Chavacano de Zamboanga, Castellano Abakay)====\n\nThe usage modes also exist in the possessive pronouns especially in Zamboangue\u00f1o. ''Amon'', ''Aton'', ''ila'' and ''inyo'' are obviously of [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] but not [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] origins, and when used as pronouns, they are of either the common or familiar mode. The inclusive and exclusive characteristics peculiar to Zamboangue\u00f1o appear again in the 1st person plural. Below is a table of the possessive pronouns in the Chavacano de Zamboanga:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o\n!Castellano Abakay (de Davao)\n|-\n|'''1st person singular'''\n|mi<br>m\u00edo<br>de mi<br>de m\u00edo<br>di mio/di m\u00edo\n|mi\nm\u00edo\n|-\n|'''2nd person singular'''\n|de vos (''common'')<br>de tu (''familiar'')<br>tuyo (''familiar'')<br>de tuyo/di tuyo (''familiar'')<br>de usted (''formal'')\n|de tu\n|-\n|'''3rd person singular'''\n|su<br>suyo<br>de su<br>de suyo/di suyo\n|ese (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\nde iya (Chino)\n|-\n|'''1st person plural'''\n|de am\u00f3n/diamon (''common/familiar'') (exclusive)<br>de at\u00f3n/diaton (''common/familiar'') (inclusive)<br>nuestro (''formal'')<br>de/di nuestro (''formal'')\n|nuestro\n|-\n|'''2nd person plural'''\n|de i\u00f1o/di inyo (''common'')<br>de vosotros (''familiar'')<br>de ustedes (''formal'')\n|vos\n|-\n|'''3rd person plural'''\n|de ila (''common/familiar'')<br>de ellos/di ellos (''formal'')\n|de ellos\n|}\n\n===Verbs===\n\nIn Zamboangue\u00f1o, Chavacano verbs are mostly Spanish in origin. In contrast with the other varieties, there is rarely a Zamboangue\u00f1o verb that is based on or has its origin from other Philippine languages. Hence, verbs contribute much of the Spanish vocabulary in Chavacano de Zamboanga.\n\nGenerally, the simple form of the Zamboangue\u00f1o verb is based upon the infinitive of the Spanish verb, minus the final /r/. For example, ''continuar'', ''hablar'', ''poner'', ''recibir'', and ''llevar'' become ''continu\u00e1'', ''habl\u00e1'', ''pon\u00e9'', ''recib\u00ed'', and ''llev\u00e1'' with the accent called \"acento agudo\" on the final syllable.\n\nThere are some rare exceptions. Some verbs are not derived from infinitives but from words that are technically Spanish phrases or from other Spanish verbs. For example, ''dar'' (give) does not become 'da' but ''dale'' (give) (literally in Spanish, to \"give it\" [verb phrase]). In this case, ''dale'' has nothing to do with the Spanish infinitive ''dar''. The Chavacano ''brinca'' (to hop) is from Spanish ''brincar'' which means the same thing.\n\n====Verb tenses - simple tenses====\n\nChavacano of Zamboangue\u00f1o uses the words ''ya'' (from Spanish ''ya'' [already]), ''ta'' (from Spanish ''est\u00e1'' [is]), and ''ay'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o infinitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|ya cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|ay cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|ya beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|ay beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|ya dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|ay dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|ya ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|ay ped\u00ed\n|}\n\nCavite\u00f1 uses the words ''ya'', ''ta'', and ''di'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Cavite\u00f1 infinitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|ya cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|di cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|ya beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|di beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|ya dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|di dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|ya ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|di ped\u00ed\n|}\n\nWhile Bahra uses the words ''a'', ''ta'', and ''di'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Bahra ininitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|a cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|di cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|a beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|di beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|a dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|di dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|a ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|di ped\u00ed\n|}\nUnlike in the Zamboangue\u00f1o, Cavite\u00f1, and Bahra, Castellano Abakay (Davaoe\u00f1o) doesn't have the ''ya'' and ''ta'' prefix. The infinitives and their conjugations are somehow retained, and there are some that have simplified conjugations:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Castellano Abakay infinitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cantar\n|cant\u00f3\n|canta\n|cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beber\n|bib\u00edo\n|bebe\n|beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dormir\n|durmi\u00f3\n|duerme\n|dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|pedir\n|pidi\u00f3\n|pide\n|ped\u00ed\n|}\n\n=====Perfect constructions=====\n\nIn Zamboangue\u00f1o, there are three ways to express that the verb is in the [[present perfect]]. First, ''ya'' can appear both before and after the main verb to express that in the present perspective, the action has already been completed somewhere in the past with the accent falling on the final ''ya''. Second, ''ta'' and ''ya'' can appear before and after the verb respectively to express that the action was expected to happen in the past (but did not happen), is still expected to happen in the present, and actually the expectation has been met (the verb occurs in the present). And third, a verb between ''ta'' and ''pa'' means an action started in the past and still continues in the present:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o past perfect\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o present perfect\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o future perfect\n|-\n|ya cant\u00e1 ya.\n|ta cant\u00e1 pa. / ta canta ya.\n|ay cant\u00e1 ya.\n|-\n|ya beb\u00e9 ya.\n|ta beb\u00e9 pa. / ta Bebe ya.\n|ay beb\u00e9 ya.\n|-\n|ya dorm\u00ed ya.\n|ta dorm\u00ed pa. / ta dormi ya.\n|ay dorm\u00ed ya.\n|-\n|ya ped\u00ed ya.\n|ya ped\u00ed pa. / ya ped\u00ed ya.\n|ay ped\u00ed ya.\n|}\n\nThe [[past perfect]] exists in Zamboangue\u00f1o. The words ''antes'' (before) and ''despues'' (after) can be used between two sentences in the simple past form to show which verb came first. The words ''antes'' (before) and ''despues'' (after) can also be used between a sentence in the present perfect using ''ya'' + verb + ''ya'' and another sentence in the simple past tense:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Past perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Past perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ya mir\u00e1 kame el pel\u00edcula antes de ya compr\u00e1 con el maga chichir\u00edas.\n|We had watched the movie before we bought the snacks.\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Past perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Past perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ya mir\u00e1 ya kame el pel\u00edcula despu\u00e9s ya compr\u00e1 kame con el maga chichir\u00edas.\n|We had watched the movie and then we bought the snacks.\n|}\n\nZamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano uses a verb between \"hay\" and \"ya\" to denote the [[future perfect]] and [[past perfect]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Future perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Future perfect (English)\n|-\n|Hay mir\u00e1 ya kame el pel\u00edcula si hay lleg\u00e1 vosotros.\n|We will have watched the movie when you arrive.\n|}\n\nZamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano also uses a verb between \"ta\" and \"ya\" to denote the [[present perfect]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Present perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Present perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ta mir\u00e1 ya kame con el pel\u00edcula mientras ta esper\u00e1 con vosotros.\n|We are already watching the movie while waiting for you.\n|}\n\n====Passive and active voice====\n\nTo form the Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano active voice, Zamboangue\u00f1os follow the pattern:\n\n'''El maga soldao ya mata con el criminal'''\nThe soldiers killed the criminal.\n\nAs illustrated above, active (causative) voice is formed by placing the doer ''el maga soldao'' before the verb phrase ''ya mata'' and then the object ''el criminal'' as indicated by the particle ''con''\n\nTraditionally, Zamboangue\u00f1o does not have a passive construction of its own.<ref>Chabacano de Zamboanga Handbook</ref>\n\n==Archaic Spanish words and false friends==\n\nChabacano has preserved plenty of archaic Spanish phrases and words in its vocabulary that modern Spanish no longer uses; for example:\n\n:\"En denantes\" which means 'a while ago' (Spanish: \"hace un tiempo\"). Take note that \"En denantes\" is an archaic Spanish phrase. Modern Spanish would express the phrase as \"hace poco tiempo\" or \"hace un tiempo\", but Chabacano still retains this archaic Spanish phrase and many other archaic Spanish words. This word is still being used in some areas of southern Spain.\n\n:\"Masquen\"/\"Masquin\" means 'even (if)' or 'although'. In Spanish, \"mas que\" is an archaic Spanish phrase meaning 'although', nowadays replaced by the Spanish word \"aunque\".<ref>Brooks 1933, Vol. 16, 1st Ed.</ref>\n\n:In Chavacano, the Spanish language is commonly called \"castellano\". Chavacano speakers, especially older Zamboangue\u00f1os, call the language as \"castellano\" implying the original notion as the language of Castille while \"espa\u00f1ol\" is used to mean a Spaniard or a person from Spain.\n\n:The pronoun \"vos\" is alive in Chavacano. While \"vos\" was used in the highest form of respect before the 16th century in classical Spanish and is quite archaic nowadays in modern Spanish (much like the English \"thou\"), in Chavacano it is used at the common level of usage (lower than tu, which is used at the familiar level) in the same manner of [[Cervantes]] and in the same manner as in certain Latin American countries such as Argentina (informally and in contrast with usted, which is used formally). Chavacano followed the development of vos in same manner as in Latin America \u2013 (the [[voseo]]) or, incidentally, as with English \"thou\" vs. \"you\".\n\n:\"Ansina\" means 'like that' or 'that way'. In modern Spanish, \"as\u00ed\" is the evolved form of this archaic word. The word \"ansina\" can still be heard among the aged in [[Mexico]] and is the only way of expressing this meaning in [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]].\n\nOn the other hand, some words from the language spoken in Spain have evolved or have acquired totally different meanings in Chavacano. Hence, for Castillian speakers who would encounter Chavacano speakers, some words familiar to them have become [[false friends]]. Some examples of false friends are:\n\n:\"Siguro\"/\"Seguro\" means 'maybe'. In Spanish, \"seguro\" means 'sure', 'secure', or 'stable', although it could imply probability as well, as in the phrase, \"Seguramente vendr\u00e1\" (Probably he will come).\n\n:\"Siempre\" means 'of course'. In Spanish, \"siempre\" means 'always'.\n\n:\"Firmi\" means 'always'. In Spanish, \"firme\" means 'firm' or 'steady'.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Philippine Spanish]]\n*[[Spanish Filipino]]\n*[[Spanish-based creole languages]]\n*[[Spanish East Indies]]\n*[[Hispanic]]\n*[[Chavacano Wikipedia]]\n\n==Codes==\n:[[ISO 639-1]]: ''none''\n:[[ISO 639-2]]: '''crp'''<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n:[[ISO 639-3]]: '''cbk'''<ref name=\"SIL International\"/>\n:[[SIL code]]: '''cbk'''<ref name=\"SIL International\">SIL International</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=John|title=M\u00e1s que, mas que and mas \u00a1qu\u00e9!|journal=Hispania|volume=16|issue=1|pages=23\u201334|issn=00182133|doi=10.2307/332588|date=1 January 1933|jstor=332588}}\n*Castillo, Edwin Gabriel Ma., S.J. \"Glosario Liturgico: Liturgical Literacy in the Chavacano de Zamboanga\",(Unpublished) Archdiocese of Zamboanga.\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Chambers |editor1-first=John, S.J. |editor2-last=Wee |editor2-first=Salvador, S.J. |title=English-Chabacano Dictionary |date=2003 |publisher=Ateneo de Zamboanga University Press}}\n*Holm, J.

The variety spoken in [[Zamboanga City]], located in the southern Philippine island group of Mindanao, has the highest concentration of speakers. Other currently existing varieties are found in Cavite City and Ternate, located in the Cavite province on the island of Luzon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/cbk|title=Chavacano|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}</ref> Chavacano is the only Spanish-based [[Creole language|creole]] in [[Asia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zamboanga.com/history/history_chabacano_versus_related_creoles.htm|title=The Early History of Chavacano de Zamboanga: Chabacano versus related creoles|website=www.zamboanga.com|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref>\n\nThe different varieties of Chavacano differ in certain aspects like vocabulary but they are generally [[mutually intelligible]] by speakers of these varieties, especially between neighboring varieties. While a majority of the lexicon of the different Chavacano varieties derive from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], their grammatical structures are generally similar to other [[Philippine languages]]. Among [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], it is the only one that is not an [[Austronesian language]], but like [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]], it uses [[reduplication]].\n\nThe word ''{{wiktes|chabacano|Chabacano}}'' is derived from Spanish, roughly meaning \"poor taste\" or \"vulgar\", though the term itself carries no negative connotations to contemporary speakers and has lost its original Spanish meaning.\n\n== Distribution and variants ==\n\n===Varieties===\n[[Image:Map chavacano.gif|thumb|right|190px|Native Zamboangue\u00f1o speakers in Mindanao]]\n\nLinguists have identified at least six Spanish Creole varieties in the Philippines. Their classification is based on their [[substratum|substrate languages]] and the regions where they are commonly spoken. The three known varieties of Chavacano with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] as their substrate language are the [[Luzon]]-based creoles of which are '''Cavite\u00f1o''' (spoken in [[Cavite City]]), '''Bahra''' or '''Ternate\u00f1o''' (spoken in [[Ternate, Cavite]]) and '''Ermite\u00f1o''' (once spoken in the old district of [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]] in [[Manila]] and is now extinct).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Variety\n! style=\"width:13%;\"| Places\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Native speakers\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Zamboangue\u00f1o (Zamboangue\u00f1o/Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano/Chabacano de Zamboanga)'''||'''[[Zamboanga City]], [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], [[Tawi-Tawi]], [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]],''' || 359,000 (Rubino 2008, citing 2000 census)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\">Ethnologue</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Cavite\u00f1o (Chabacano di Nisos/Chabacano de Cavite)'''||'''[[Cavite]]'''|| 4,000 (2013)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Cotabate\u00f1o (Chabacano de Cotabato)'''||'''[[Cotabato City]], [[Maguindanao]]'''|| Dead\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Castellano Abakay (Chabacano Davaoe\u00f1o)'''||'''[[Davao Region]],''' '''[[Davao City]]'''|| Extinct \n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Ternate\u00f1o (Bahra)'''||'''[[Ternate, Cavite|Ternate]]'''|| 3,000 (2013)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Ermite\u00f1o (Ermitense)'''||'''[[Ermita]]'''|| Extinct\n|}\n\nThere are a number of theories on how these different varieties of Chavacano have evolved and how they are related to one another. According to some linguists, Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano is believed to have been influenced by Cavite\u00f1o Chabacano as evidenced by prominent [[Zamboangue\u00f1o]] families who descended from Spanish Army officers (from [[Spain]] and [[Latin America]]), primarily Cavite\u00f1o mestizos, stationed at [[Fort Pilar]] in the 19th century. When Cavite\u00f1o officers recruited workers and technicians from [[Iloilo]] to man their [[sugar]] plantations and [[rice]] fields to reduce the local population's dependence on the Donativo de Zamboanga, the Spanish colonial government levied taxes on the islanders to support the fort's operations. With the subsequent migration of Ilonggo traders to Zamboanga, the Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano was infused with Hiligaynon words as the previous migrant community was assimilated.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205215037/http://www.zamboanga.org/chavacano/chabacano_by_ben_saavedra.htm|title=Mensajes Y Noticias|date=2005-02-05|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>\n\nMost of what appears to be [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] words in Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano are actually Hiligaynon. Although Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano's contact with Cebuano began much earlier when Cebuano soldiers were stationed at Fort Pilar during the Spanish colonial period, it was not until closer to the middle of the 20th century that borrowings from Cebuano accelerated from more migration from the Visayas as well as the current migration from other Visayan-speaking areas of the Zamboanga Peninsula.\n\n'''Zamboangue\u00f1o''' (Chavacano) is spoken in [[Zamboanga City]], [[Basilan]], parts of [[Sulu]] and [[Tawi-Tawi]], and [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]] and [[Zamboanga del Norte]]. Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano is the most dynamically spoken language of Philippine Creole Spanish. It is used as a lingua franca between both Muslim and Christians in the Southwestern Mindanao and Basilan Islands communities. Its influence has spread to other islands in the west, such as the Jolo Islands, as well as to Cotabato and Davao in Mindanao, and finally down south to Malaysia.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2005-06-01|title=The Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages and the Society for Pidgin and Creole Linguistics, In Retrospect|journal=Creole Language in Creole Literatures|volume=20|issue=1|pages=167\u2013174|doi=10.1075/jpcl.20.1.09gil|issn=0920-9034}}</ref> The other varieties of Chavacano with [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] as their primary substrate language are the [[Mindanao]]-based creoles of which are '''Castellano Abakay''' or '''Chavacano Davaoe\u00f1o''' (now extinct but was spoken in some areas of [[Davao City|Davao]]), influenced by [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and divided into two varieties, ''Castellano Abakay Chino'' and ''Castellano Abakay Jap\u00f3n'', and '''Cotabate\u00f1o''' (no longer spoken in [[Cotabato City]]). Both Cotabate\u00f1o and Davaoe\u00f1o are very similar to Zamboangue\u00f1o.\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe Chavacano languages in the Philippines are creoles based on [[Mexican Spanish]] and possibly, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. In some Chavacano languages, most words are common with [[Andalusian Spanish]], but there are many words borrowed from [[Nahuatl]], a language native to Central Mexico, which aren\u2019t found in Andalusian Spanish. Although the vocabulary is largely Mexican, its grammar is mostly based on other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], primarily [[Hiligaynon language|Ilonggo]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]. By way of Spanish, its vocabulary also has influences from the Native American languages [[Nahuatl]], [[Taino]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], etc. as can be evidenced by the words chongo (monkey, instead of Spanish '{{wiktspa|mono}}'), tiange (mini markets), etc.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn contrast with the Luzon-based dialects, the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety has the most borrowings and/or influence from other Philippine [[Austronesian languages]] including [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. Words of [[Malay language|Malay]] origin are present in the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety; the latter is included because although not local in Philippines, it was the lingua franca of [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. As the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety is also spoken by Muslims, the variety has some [[Arabic language|Arabic]] loanwords, most commonly [[Glossary of Islam|Islamic terms]].{{specify|date=February 2018}}{{dubious|date=February 2018}} In spite of this, it\u2019s difficult to trace whether these words have their origin in the local population or in Spanish itself, given that Spanish has about 6,000 words of Arabic origin. Chavacano also contains loanwords of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin which enter Chavacano via Malay and Arabic; both Persian and Spanish are [[Indo-European languages]].\n\n===Demographics===\nThe highest number of Chavacano speakers are found in '''[[Zamboanga City]]''' and in the island province of [[Basilan]]. A significant number of Chavacano speakers are found in Cavite City and Ternate. There are also speakers in some areas in the provinces of [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], Davao, and in Cotabato City. According to the official 2000 Philippine census, there were altogether 607,200 Chavacano speakers in the Philippines in that same year. The exact figure could be higher as the 2000 population of Zamboanga City, whose main language is Chavacano, far exceeded that census figure. Also, the figure doesn\u2019t include Chavacano speakers of the [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino diaspora]]. All the same, Zamboangue\u00f1o is the variety with the most number of speakers, being the official language of Zamboanga City whose population is now believed to be over a million; is also an official language in Basilan.\n\nChavacano speakers are also found in [[Semporna]] and elsewhere in Sabah as Sabah was under partial Spanish sovereignty and via Filipino refugees who escaped from [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] and predominantly Muslim areas of Mindanao like [[Sulu Archipelago]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Susanne Michaelis|title=Roots of Creole Structures: Weighing the Contribution of Substrates and Superstrates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPUeQLcGMOMC|year=2008|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-5255-6}}</ref>\n\nA small number of Zamboanga's indigenous peoples and of Basilan, such as the [[Taus\u016bg people|Tausug]]s, the [[Samal people|Samals]], and the [[Yakan]]s, majority of those people are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], also speak the language. In the close provinces of Sulu and [[Tawi-Tawi]] areas, there are Muslim speakers of the ''Chavacano de Zamboanga'', all of them are neighbors of Christians. Speakers of the ''Chavacano de Zamboanga'', both Christians and Muslims, also live in [[Lanao del Norte]] and [[Lanao del Sur]]. Christians and Muslims in [[Maguindanao]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Cotabato]], [[South Cotabato]], [[Cotabato City]], and [[Saranggani]] speak ''Chavacano de Zamboanga''. Take note that [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-tawi, [[Maguindanao]], [[Cotabato City]], [[Soccsksargen]] (region that composed of [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Cotabato]], [[South Cotabato]], and [[Saranggani]]) and Davao Region became part of short-lived [[Republic of Zamboanga]], which chose Chavacano as [[official language]].\n\n===Social significance===\nChavacano has been primarily and practically a spoken language. In the past, its use in literature was limited and chiefly local to the geographical location where the particular variety of the language was spoken. Its use as a spoken language far exceeds its use in literary work in comparison to the use of Spanish in the Philippines which was more successful as a written language than a spoken language. In recent years, there have been efforts to encourage the use of Chavacano as a written language, but the attempts were mostly minor attempts in folklore and religious literature and few pieces of written materials by the print media. In Zamboanga City, while the language is used by the mass media, the Catholic Church, education, and the local government, there have been few literary work written in Zamboangue\u00f1o and access to these resources by the general public isn\u2019t readily available; Bibles of Protestant Christians are also written in standard Chavacano. As Chavacano is spoken by Muslims as second language not only in Zamboanga City and Basilan but even in Sulu and Tawi-tawi, a number of [[Qur'an]] books are published in Chavacano.\n\nThe Zamboangue\u00f1o variety has been constantly evolving especially during half of the past century until the present. Zamboangue\u00f1o has been experiencing an infusion of English and more Tagalog words and from other languages worldwide in its vocabulary and there have been debates and discussions among older Chavacano speakers, new generation of Chavacano speakers, scholars, linguists, sociologists, historians, and educators regarding its preservation, cultivation, standardization, and its future as a Spanish-based creole. In 2000, The [[Instituto Cervantes]] in Manila hosted a conference entitled \"Shedding Light on the Chavacano Language\" at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. Starting school year 2012\u201313, the Zamboangue\u00f1o variant has also been taught at schools following the implementation of the Department of Education's policy of Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE). It serves as a medium of instruction from kindergarten to grade 3 and as a separate subject (Mother Tongue) from grades 1 to 3.\n\nBecause of the grammatical structures, Castilian usage, and archaic Spanish words and phrases that Chavacano (especially Zamboangue\u00f1o) uses, between speakers of both contemporary Spanish and Chavacano who are uninitiated, both languages appear to be non-intelligible to a large extent. For the initiated speakers, Chavacano can be intelligible to some Spanish speakers, and while most Spanish words can easily be understood by Chavacano speakers, many would struggle to understand a complete Spanish sentence.{{says who}}\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term '''Chavacano''' or '''Chabacano''' originated from the Spanish word ''{{wiktspa|chabacano}}'' which literally means \"poor taste\", \"vulgar\", \"common\", \"of low quality\", or \"coarse\". Chavacano has since evolved into a word of its own in different spellings with no negative connotation, but to simply being the name of the language itself.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, what is today called ''Chavacano'' was also called by the Spanish-speaking population as the \"''lenguaje de la calle''\", \"''lenguaje de parian''\" (language of the street), or \"''lenguaje de cocina''\" (kitchen Spanish) to refer to the Chabacano spoken by the people of Manila, particularly in Ermita) to distinguish it from the Spanish language spoken by those of the upper class, which consisted of Spaniards and educated Natives.\n\nLinguists use the term '''Philippine Creole Spanish''' which can be further divided into two geographic classifications: Manila Bay Creoles (which includes Ternate\u00f1o and Cavite\u00f1o) and Mindanao Creole (including Zamboangue\u00f1o). The varieties of the language are geographically related. The Manila Bay Creoles have Tagalog as their substrate language while The Mindanao Creoles have [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] (mostly [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Tausug language|Tausug]], and [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]), [[Subanon language|Subanon]], and [[Sama language|Sama]] as their substrate language(s). \n\nChavacano/Chabacano speakers themselves have different preferences on whether to spell the language with a V or a B.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Noun phrases in Creole languages : a multi-faceted approach|date=2007|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|others=Baptista, Marlyse., Gu\u00e9ron, Jacqueline.|isbn=9789027291820|location=Amsterdam|oclc=233632814}}</ref> They emphasise the difference between their variety and others using their own geographical location as a point of reference. Language speakers in Ternate also use the term Bahra to refer to their language and their city. Chavacano varieties usually have their area name attached to the language.\n\nIn Zamboanga City, most people are using the V in spelling the language as Chavacano. In the three-day Chavacano Orthography Congress held on Nov 19-21, 2014, wherein it included the presentation by researchers on Chavacano, mostly results from surveys conducted among selected respondents in the city, the newly organized Chavacano Orthography Council met with the officials of the Department of Education and agreed among others that the language is to be spelled with the V. Most people in support of this move would like to distance their language Chavacano to the word Chabacano which also means \u2018vulgar\u201d in Spanish.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Chavacano/Chabacano varieties and alternative names\n!Location\n!Geographical area\n!Alternative names and spellings\n|-\n|Zamboanga\n|Mindanao\n|Chavacano, Zamboangue\u00f1o, Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano\n|-\n|Cavite\n|Manila Bay\n|Chabacano de Cavite, Cavite\u00f1, Caviten, Linguaje de Niso\n|-\n|Basilan\n|Mindanao\n|Zamboangue\u00f1o, Chavacano de Zamboanga\n|-\n|Cotabato\n|Mindanao\n|Cotabate\u00f1, Cotabato Chavacano\n|-\n|Davao\n|Mindanao\n|Davaoe\u00f1o, Davaoe\u00f1o Zamboangue\u00f1o, Castellano Abakay, Davao Chavacano\n|-\n|Ermita\n|Manila Bay\n|Ermitense, Ermita Chabacano\n|-\n|Ternate\n|Manila Bay\n|Ternate\u00f1o, Ternate\u00f1o Chabacano, Bahra, Linguaje di Bahra\n|}\n\n==Historical background==\n\nThere is no definite conclusion on the precise history of how these different varieties of Chavacano developed.\n\nPrior to the formation of what is today the Philippines, what existed were a collection of various islands and different [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnolinguistic group]]s inhabiting them. The [[Spanish Colonisation of the Philippines|Spanish colonisation]] of the Philippine islands had led to the presence of the Spanish language in the islands. Though Spanish was the language of the government, the various languages originating and found in the islands remained the mother tongue of the various inhabitants. Instead of using Spanish to spread Christianity, Spanish missionaries preferred to learn the various local languages. With over 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, the Spanish language came to influence the various Philippine languages to varying degrees by way of aspects like new loanwords and expressions.\n\nCreole languages (such as [[French-based creole]]s) have formed at various points in time around the world due to colonialism. As a result of contact between speakers of two mutually non-intelligible languages, creole languages have evolved in some cases to facilitate communication. This usually involves taking the vocabulary of another language and grammatical features of the native language. In contrast to the numerous French-based creole languages, only three creole languages have been found to be Spanish-based or heavily influenced: [[Papiamento]], [[Palenquero]], and Chavacano. In the Philippines, a major difficulty in tracing the development of Chabacano is the confusion attributed to in accounts of travelers to the Philippines between a coherent creole language, `broken Spanish', and fluent Spanish.<ref>Lipski, J. M. Chabacano/Spanish and the Philippine linguistic identity.</ref> The earliest believed attestation of a coherent creole language spoken in Cavite City comes from the Augustinian priest Mart\u00ednez de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga who in his 1803 accounts of his travels in the Philippines, ''Estadismos de las Islas Filipinas'', notes that \"In Cavite and in its suburb of San Roque, a very corrupted Spanish is spoken, whose phraseology is entirely taken from the language of the country\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Mentions of a vernacular referred to as \"kitchen Spanish\" and \"language of the market\" (referring to the Manila variety), or other terms are found in a number of texts of the 19th century. However, the kind of vernacular referred to by these terms are imprecise and these terms may refer to a fully fledged creole or to a Spanish-pidgin spoken by Chinese and Filipino merchants.\n\nThe manner of formation of this type of speech found in a number of communities around the Philippines remains unclear today. A sample of what is today called ''Chabacano'' may be found in dialogues contained in chapters 18 (''Supercher\u00edas'') and 28 (''Tatakut'') of Filipino writer [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s 1891 work ''[[El Filibusterismo]]''.<ref>text reproduced by [https://filipinoscribbles.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/chabacano-in-el-filibusterismo/ Filipino Scribbles]</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.angelfire.com/art2/roger_santos/rizal.html | title=Chabacano - Cavite's Dialect}}</ref> The dialogue found in chapter 18 is:\n\n{{quote|''\u00bfPorque ba no di pod\u00ed nis\u00f3s entr\u00e1?'' preguntaba una voz de mujer.\n\n\u2015''Ab\u00e1, \u00f1ora, porque \u2018tall\u00e1 el man\u00e1 prailes y el man\u00e1 empleau'', contest\u00f3 un hombre; ''\u2018ta jas\u00ed solo para il\u00f3s el cabesa de espinge''.\n\n\u2015''\u00a1Curioso tambi\u00e9n el man\u00e1 prailes!'' dijo la voz de mujer alej\u00e1ndose; ''\u00a1no quiere pa que di sab\u00e9 nisos cuando ilos ta sali inga\u00f1au! \u00a1Cosa! \u00a1Querida be de praile el cabesa!''}}\n\nIn the 1883 work of German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]] ''Uber das Malaiospanische der Philippinen'', he presents fragments of texts and comments of what he calls \"Malayo-Spanish\". However, the first to give a general study and investigation of the varieties of Chavacano as a group was by Keith Whinnom in his 1956 work ''The Spanish Contact Vernaculars in the Philippine Islands ''. Whinnom gives an overall view of the history and grammar of what he calls \"Ermita\u00f1o\" of Ermita in Manila, \"Cavite\u00f1o\" of Cavite and \"Zamboangue\u00f1o\" of Zamboanga. In it, he also postulated his [[Monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] on the origin of these vernaculars.\n\nLinguists are unsettled on how these vernaculars formed and how they connect to one another, if any. There are many theories but the two main theories of the origin of Chavacano are: Whinnom's \"monogenetic theory\" and a \"parallel-development\" theory proposed by Frake in 1971.\n\n===Monogenetic theory===\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\nAccording to the Monogentic theory or one-way theory advanced by Whinnom, all varieties of Chavacano result from a single source and that varieties are related to each other.\n\n===Parallel-development theory===\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\nThe parallel development theory or two-way theory as advocated by Frake in 1971, the variants found in Luzon and Mindanao had evolved autonomously from each other.\n\n===Zamboangue\u00f1o===\n\nOn 23 June 1635, [[Zamboanga City]] became a permanent foothold of the Spanish government with the construction of the [[Fort Pilar|San Jos\u00e9 Fortress]]. Bombardment and harassment from pirates and raiders of the sultans of [[Mindanao]] and [[Jolo]] and the determination to spread Christianity further south (as Zamboanga was a crucial strategic location) of the Philippines forced the Spanish missionary friars to request reinforcements from the colonial government.\n\nThe military authorities decided to import labour from Luzon and the Visayas. Thus, the construction workforce eventually consisted of Spanish, Mexican and Peruvian soldiers, masons from Cavite (who comprised the majority), sacadas from Cebu and Iloilo, and those from the various local tribes of Zamboanga like the Samals and Subanons.\n\nLanguage differences made it difficult for one ethnic group to communicate with another. To add to this, work instructions were issued in Spanish. The majority of the workers were unschooled and therefore did not understand Spanish but needed to communicate with each other and the Spaniards. A [[pidgin]] developed and became a full-fledged [[creole language]] still in use today as a [[lingua franca]] and/or as [[official language]], mainly in [[Zamboanga City]].\n\nWhen the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] gave up its territories in [[Sulu Archipelago]] to Spain within late 1700s (Sulu Sultanate gave up Basilan to Spain in 1762, while Sulu and Tawi-tawi were not given up by sultanate because the Sulu Sultanate only recognised partial Spanish sovereignty to Sulu and Tawi-tawi), Spanish settlers and soldiers brought the language to the region until Spain, [[Germany]], and [[United Kingdom]] signed an agreement named the [[Madrid Protocol of 1885]] that recognised Spanish rule of Sulu Archipelago. Chavacano becomes a lingua franca of Sulu Archipelago (composing of Sulu, Tawi-tawi, Basilan); although North Borneo (now Sabah) is not included on the [[Spanish East Indies]] area as stated on the Protocol and control by the [[United Kingdom]], Chavacano has still a little impact in Semporna.\n\nFrom then on, constant Spanish military reinforcements as well as increased presence of Spanish religious and educational institutions have fostered the Spanish creole.\n\n===Cavite\u00f1o / Ternate\u00f1o{{anchor|Cavite\u00f1o}}===\nThe [[Merdicas]] (also spelled Mardicas or Mardikas) were [[Catholic]] natives of the islands of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] of the [[Moluccas]] in the vicinity of [[New Guinea]], converted during the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] occupation of the islands by [[Jesuit]] missionaries. The islands were later captured by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] who vied for their control with the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]]. In 1663, the Spanish garrison in Ternate were forced to pull out to defend [[Manila]] against an impending invasion by the Chinese pirate [[Koxinga]] (sacrificing the Moluccas to the Dutch in doing so). A number of Merdicas volunteered to help, eventually being resettled in a sandbar near the mouth of the [[Maragondon]] river (known as the ''Barra de Maragondon'') and [[Tanza, Cavite]], Manila.<ref name=\"lipski\">{{cite book|author=John.

The Merdicas community eventually integrated into the local population. Today, the place is called [[Ternate, Cavite|Ternate]] after the island of Ternate in the Moluccas, and the descendants of the Merdicas continue to use their Spanish creole (with Portuguese influence) which came to be known as Cavite\u00f1o or Ternate\u00f1o Chavacano.<ref name=\"lipski\"/>\n\n==Samples==\n\n===Zamboangue\u00f1o===\n\n;Donde tu hay anda?\n:Spanish: \u00bfA d\u00f3nde vas?\n: (\u2018Where are you going?\u2019)\n;Ya mir\u00e1 yo con Jos\u00e9.\n:Spanish: Yo vi a Jos\u00e9.\n: (\u2018I saw Jos\u00e9.\u2019)\n;Ya empez\u00e1 ele busc\u00e1 que busc\u00e1 entero lugar con el sal.\n:Spanish: El/Ella empez\u00f3 a buscar la sal en todas partes.\n: (\u2018He/She began to search everywhere for the salt.\u2019)\n;Ya and\u00e1 ele na escuela.\n:Spanish: El/Ella se fue a la escuela.\n: (\u2018He/She went to school.\u2019)\n;Si Mario ya dorm\u00ed na casa.\n:Spanish: Mario durmi\u00f3 en la casa.\n: (\u2018Mario slept in the house.\u2019)\n;El hombre, con quien ya man encuentro tu, es mi hermano.\n:Spanish: El hombre que encontraste, es mi hermano.\n:(The man [whom] you met is my brother.)\n;El persona con quien tu tan cuento, bien alegre gayot.\n:Spanish: La persona con la que est\u00e1s hablando es muy alegre. / La persona con quien t\u00fa est\u00e1s conversando es bien alegre.\n: (The person you are talking to is very happy indeed.)\n:\n\n====Another sample of Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano\n!Spanish\n!English\n|-\n|Treinta y cuatro kilometro desde el pueblo de Zamboanga el Bunguiao, un diutay barrio que estaba un desierto.

Broadly speaking, the formal register is closer to Spanish, and the colloquial register to the local Austronesian languages.\n\nIn the common, colloquial, vulgar or familiar register/sociolect, words of local origin or a mixture of local and Spanish words predominate. The common or familiar register is used ordinarily when conversing with people of equal or lower status in society. It is also used more commonly in the family, with friends and acquaintances. Its use is of general acceptance and usage.\n\nIn the formal register/sociolect, words of Spanish origin or Spanish words predominate. The formal register is used especially when conversing with people of higher status in society. It is also used when conversing with elders (especially in the family and with older relatives) and those in authority. It is more commonly used by older generations, by Zamboangue\u00f1o mestizos, and in the barrios. It is the form used in speeches, education, media, and writing. The formal register used in conversation is sometimes mixed with some degree of colloquial register.\n\nThe following examples show a contrast between the usage of formal words and common or familiar words in Chavacano:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Chavacano (formal)\n!Chavacano (common/colloquial/vulgar/familiar)\n!Spanish\n|-\n|slippery\n|resbalozo/resbaladizo\n|malandug\n|resbaloso/resbaladizo\n|-\n|rice\n|morisqueta\n|kanon/arroz\n|morisqueta (understood as a Filipino rice dish)/arroz\n|-\n|rain\n|lluvia/aguacero\n|aguacero/ulan\n|lluvia/aguacero\n|-\n|dish\n|vianda/comida\n|comida/ulam\n|vianda/comida\n|-\n|braggart/boastful\n|orgulloso(a)\n|bugalon(a)/ hambuguero(a)\n|orgulloso(a)\n|-\n|car\n|coche\n|auto\n|auto/coche\n|-\n|housemaid\n|muchacho (m)/muchacha (f)\n|ayudanta (female); ayudante (male)\n|muchacha(o)/ayudante\n|-\n|father\n|pap\u00e1 (tata)\n|p\u00e1pang (tata)\n|pap\u00e1 (padre)\n|-\n|mother\n|mam\u00e1 (nana)\n|m\u00e1mang (nana)\n|mam\u00e1 (madre)\n|-\n|grandfather\n|abuelo\n|abuelo/lolo\n|abuelo/lolo\n|-\n|grandmother\n|abuela\n|abuela/lola\n|abuela/lela\n|-\n|small\n|chico(a)/peque\u00f1o(a)\n|peque\u00f1o(a)/diutay\n|peque\u00f1o/chico\n|-\n|nuisance\n|fastidio\n|asarante / salawayun\n|fastidio\n|-\n|hard-headed\n|testarudo\n|duro cabeza/duro pulso\n|testarudo/cabeza dura\n|-\n|slippers\n|chancla\n|chinelas\n|chancla/chinelas\n|-\n|married\n|de estado/de estao\n|casado/casao\n|casado\n|-\n|(my) parents\n|(mis) padres\n|(mi) tata'y nana\n|(mis) padres\n|-\n|naughty\n|travieso(a)\n|guachi / guachinanggo(a)\n|travieso(a)\n|-\n|slide\n|rezbalasa/deslizar\n|landug\n|resbalar/deslizar\n|-\n|ugly\n|feo (masculine)/fea (feminine)\n|malacara, malacuka\n|feo(a)\n|-\n|rainshower\n|lluve\n|tal\u00edtih\n|lluvia\n|-\n|lightning\n|rayo\n|rayo/quirlat\n|rayo\n|-\n|thunder/thunderstorm\n|trueno\n|trueno\n|trueno\n|-\n|tornado\n|tornado/remolino, remulleno\n|ipo-ipo\n|tornado/remolino\n|-\n|thin (person)\n|delgado(a)/flaco(a)/chiquito(a)\n|flaco/flaquit\n|delgado/flaco/flaquito\n|}\n\n==Writing system==\n{{contradiction|Are there 29 or 30 letters--is <rr> a letter?|date=January 2016}}\n\nChavacano is written using the [[Latin script]]. As Chavacano has mostly been a [[spoken language]] than a written one, multiple ways of writing the different varieties of Chavacano exist. Most published Chavacano texts utilize spelling systems nearly identical to Spanish, adjusting certain spellings of words to reflect how they are pronounced by native Chavacano speakers. Since the propagation of the usage of the [[Filipino language]] in education and the media as the national language, Filipino's orthography has affected how certain persons might spell Chavacano, especially since recent generations have grown unfamiliar with Spanish orthography; Most published works, and the general media, however more often retain Spanish-based spelling systems.\n\nThe kind of writing system used to write Chavacano may differ according to the writer of the text. Writing may be written using a Spanish-derived writing system, where all words (including words of local origin) are spelled adhering to basic Spanish orthographic rules; it may also be written \"phonetically\", similar to the modern orthography of Filipino; another writing style uses a mixture of the two, spelling words based on an etymological approach, using phonetic spelling for words of Filipino origin and Spanish spelling rules for words of Spanish origin.\n\nin Zamboanga, an etymological-based approach was formally recently endorsed by the local city government and this is the system used in public schools as part of the mother-tongue policy of the Department of Education for kindergarten to grade 3. In principle, words of Spanish origin are to be spelled using Spanish rules while Chavacano words of local origin are spelled in the manner according to their origin. Thus, the letter ''k'' appear mostly in words of [[Austronesian]] origin or in loanwords from other Philippine languages (words such as ''kame'', ''kita'', ''kanamon'', ''kaninyo'').\n<!--Unsourced:\nSome additional characters like the ''\u00f1'' (''e\u00f1e'', representing the phoneme {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, a letter distinct from ''n'' but typographically composed of an ''n'' with a [[tilde]]), the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ch'' ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}), the ''ll'' ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}}), and the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''rr'' ({{lang|es|erre}} with strong ''r'') exist in Chavacano.-->\n\nIt is uncommon in modern written works to include the [[acute accent]] and the [[trema (diacritic)|trema]] in writing except in linguistic or highly formalized texts. Also, the letters ''\u00f1'' and ''ll'' are sometimes replaced by ''ny'' and ''ly'' in informal texts.\n\n===Alphabet===\n\nThe Chavacano alphabet has 30 letters, including <ch>, <ll>, <\u00f1> and <rr>:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Languages of the Southern Gateway: Chavacano, Sinama, Tausug, Yakan|last=Department of Education, Culture and Sports and The Summer Institute of Linguistics|publisher=The Summer Institute of Linguistics|year=1979|isbn=978-9711801311|location=Manila, Philippines|pages=}}</ref>\n\n'''a''', '''b''', '''c''', '''ch''', '''d''', '''e''', '''f''', '''g''', '''h''', '''i''', '''j''', '''k''', '''l''', '''ll''', '''m''', '''n''', '''\u00f1''', '''o''', '''p''', '''q''', '''r''', '''rr''', '''s''', '''t''', '''u''', '''v''', '''w''', '''x''', '''y''', '''z'''\n\n====Letters and letter names====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | A a || style=\"width: 17em;\" | '''a''' {{IPA|/a/}}\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | J j || style=\"width: 20em;\" | '''jota''' {{IPA|/\u02c8xota/}}\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | R r || style=\"width: 25em;\" | '''ere''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u027ee/}}\n|-\n| B b || '''be''' {{IPA|/be/}}<br>\n| K k || '''ka''' {{IPA|/ka/}}\n| Rr rr || '''erre''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ere/}}\n|-\n| C c || '''ce'''  {{IPA|/se/}}\n| L l || '''ele''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ele/}}\n| S s || '''ese''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ese/}}\n|-\n| Ch ch || '''che''' {{IPA|/t\u0283e/}}\n| Ll ll || '''elle''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u028ee/}}\n| T t || '''te''' {{IPA|/te/}}\n|-\n| D d || '''de''' {{IPA|/de/}}\n| M m || '''eme''' {{IPA|/\u02c8eme/}}\n| U u || '''u''' {{IPA|/u/}}\n|-\n| E e || '''e''' {{IPA|/e/}}\n| N n || '''ene''' {{IPA|/ene/}}\n| V v || '''uve''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ube/}}\n|-\n| F f || '''efe''' {{IPA|/\u02c8efe/}}\n| \u00d1 \u00f1 || '''e\u00f1e''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u0272e/}}\n| W w || '''doble u''' {{IPA|/\u02c8uve doble/}}<br>\n|-\n| G g || '''ge''' {{IPA|/xe/}}\n| O o || '''o''' {{IPA|/o/}}\n| X x || '''equis''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ekis/}}\n|-\n| H h || '''hache''' {{IPA|/\u02c8at\u0283e/}}\n| P p || '''pe''' {{IPA|/pe/}}\n| Y y || '''ye''' {{IPA|/\u025f\u029de/}}<br>\n|-\n| I i || '''i''' {{IPA|/i/}}<br>\n| Q q || '''cu''' {{IPA|/ku/}}\n| Z z || '''zeta''' {{IPA|/\u02c8seta/}}<br>'''zeda''' {{IPA|/\u02c8seda/}}\n|}\n\nOther letter combinations include ''rr'' (erre), which is pronounced {{IPA|/xr/}} or {{IPA|/r/}}, and ''ng,'' which is pronounced {{IPA|/\u014b\u0261/}}. Another combination was ''\u00f1g,'' which was pronounced {{IPA|/\u014b/}} but is now obsolete and is only written as ''ng''.\n\nSome sounds are not represented in the Chavacano written language. These sounds are mostly in words of Philippine and foreign origin. Furthermore, the pronunciation of some words of Spanish origin have become distorted or Philippinized in modern Chavacano. Some vowels have become allophonized ('e' and 'o' becomes 'i' and 'u' in some words) and some consonants have changed their pronunciation. (i.e. ''escoger'' became ''iscuj\u00ed'' in informal speech; ''tiene'' {{IPA|/t\u0283\u025bn\u025b/}}; ''Dios'' {{IPA|/d\u0292\u0254s/}}; ''Castilla'' became {{IPA|/kastilla/}} instead of {{IPA|/kasti\u028ea/}}).\n\nGlottal stops, as in Filipino languages, are not also indicated (\u00e2, \u00ea, \u00ee, \u00f4, \u00fb). These sounds are mainly found in words of Philippine origin and are only indicated in dictionaries (i.e. jend\u00ea = not; ol\u00ea = again) and when they are, the circumflex accent is used.\n\nOther pronunciation changes in some words of Spanish origin include:\n\n: f ~ {{IPA|/p/}}\n: j, g (before 'e' and 'i') ~ /{{IPA|h}}/ (in common with dialects of [[Caribbean Spanish|Caribbean]] and other areas of [[Spanish language in the Americas|Latin America]] and [[Andalusian Spanish|southern Spain]])\n: ch ~ {{IPA|/ts/}}\n: rr ~ {{IPA|/xr/}}\n: di, de ~ {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} (when followed or preceded by other vowels: Dios ~ /jos/ ; dejalo ~ /jalo/)\n: ti, te ~ {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} (when followed or preceded by other vowels: tierra ~ /chehra/; tiene ~ /chene/)\n: ci, si ~ {{IPA|/\u0283/}}  (when followed or preceded by other vowels: conciencia ~ /kon\u0283en\u0283a/)\n\n[b, d, g] between vowels which are [[fricatives|fricative]] [[allophones]] are pronounced as they are in Chavacano.\n\n===Other sounds===\n\n: -h {{IPA|/h/}} (glottal fricative in the final position); sometimes not written\n: -g {{IPA|/k/}}; sometimes written as just -k\n: -d {{IPA|/t/}}; sometimes written as just -t\n: -kh [{{IPA link|x}}]; only in loanwords of Arabic origin, mostly Islamic terms\n\n===Sounds from English===\n\n: \u201cv\u201d pronounced as English \u201cv\u201d (like: vase) (vi)\n: \u201cz\u201d pronounced as English \u201cz\u201d (like: zebra)  (zi)\n: \u201cx\u201d pronounced as English \u201cx\u201d (like: X-ray)  (ex/eks)\n: \u201ch\u201d like: house (/eitsh/); sometimes written as 'j'\n\n===Diphthongs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Letters\n!Pronunciation\n!Example\n!Significant\n|-\n|'''ae'''\n| aye\n| ca\u00e9\n| fall, to fall\n|-\n|'''ai'''\n| ay\n| caido\n| fallen, fell\n|-\n|'''ao'''\n| aow\n| cuidao\n| take care, cared\n|-\n|'''ea'''\n| eya\n| pat\u00e9a\n| kick, to kick\n|-\n|'''ei'''\n| ey\n| re\u00ed\n| laugh\n|-\n|'''eo'''\n| eyo\n| v\u00eddeo\n| video\n|-\n|'''ia'''\n| ya\n| advertencia\n| warning, notice\n|-\n|'''ie'''\n| ye\n| cien(to)\n| one hundred, hundred\n|-\n|'''io'''\n| yo\n| canci\u00f3n\n| song\n|-\n|'''iu'''\n| yu\n| saci\u00fat\n| to move the hips a little\n|-\n|'''uo'''\n| ow\n| institutuo\n| institute\n|-\n|'''qu'''\n| ke\n| qu\u00e9, que\n| what, that, than\n|-\n|'''gu'''\n| strong g\n| gu\u00eda\n| to guide, guide\n|-\n|'''ua'''\n| wa\n| agua\n| water\n|-\n|'''ue'''\n| we\n| cuento\n| story\n|-\n|'''ui'''\n| wi\n| cuid\u00e1\n| care, to take care\n|-\n|'''oi'''\n| oy\n| o\u00ed\n| hear, to hear\n|}\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Simple sentence structure (verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order)===\n\nChavacano is a language with the [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] sentence order. This is because it follows the Hiligaynon or Tagalog grammatical structures. However, the [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] order does exist in Chavacano but only for emphasis purposes (see below). New generations have been slowly and vigorously using the S-V-O pattern mainly because of the influence of the English language. These recent practices have been most prevalent and evident in the mass media particularly among Chavacano newswriters who translate news leads from English or Tagalog to Chavacano where the \"who\" is emphasized more than the \"what\". Because the mass media represent \"legitimacy\", it is understood by Chavacano speakers (particularly Zamboangue\u00f1os) that the S-V-O sentence structure used by Chavacano journalists is standardized.\n\n====Declarative affirmative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====\n\nChavacano generally follows the simple verb\u2013subject\u2013object or verb\u2013object\u2013subject sentence structure typical of Hiligaynon or Tagalog in declarative affirmative sentences:\n\n:'''Ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object).\n:'''Ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''tierra''' (object) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject).\n::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) ang mga manogbaligya (subject) sang duta (object).\n::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) sang duta (object) ang mga manogbaligya (subject).\n::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ang mga negosyante (subject) ng lupa (object).\n::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ng lupa (object) ang mga negosyante (subject).\n:::(\u2018The businessmen are buying land.\u2019)\n\nThe subject always appears after the verb, and in cases where pronominal subjects (such as personal pronouns) are used in sentences, they will never occur before the verb:\n\n:'''Ya and\u00e1 yo na iglesia enantes'''.\n::(\u2018I went to church a while ago.\u2019)\n\n====Declarative negative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====\n\nWhen the predicate of the sentence is negated, Chavacano uses the words '''jendeh''' (from Tagalog \u2019hindi\u2019 or Hiligaynon 'indi' which means \u2019no\u2019; the Cebuano uses 'dili', which shows its remoteness from Chavacano as compared to Hiligaynon) to negate the verb in the present tense, '''no hay''' (which literally means \u2019none\u2019) to negate the verb that was supposed to happen in the past, and '''jend\u00eah''' or '''nunca''' (which means \u2019no\u2019 or \u2019never\u2019) to negate the verb that will not or will never happen in the future respectively. This manner of negating the predicate always happens in the verb\u2013subject\u2013object or verb\u2013object\u2013subject sentence structure:\n\nPresent Tense\n\n:'''Jend\u00eah ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object).\n:'''Jend\u00eah ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''tierra''' (object) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject).\n::(Eng: The businessmen are not buying land.

Span: el hombre de negocio nunca comprar\u00e1 terreno)\n\n===Nouns and articles===\n\nThe Chavacano definite article '''el''' precedes a singular noun or a plural marker (for a plural noun). The indefinite article '''un''' stays constant for gender as 'una' has almost completely disappeared in Chavacano, except for some phrases like \"una vez\". It also stays constant for number as for singular nouns. In Chavacano, it is quite common for '''el''' and '''un''' to appear together before a singular noun, the former to denote certainty and the latter to denote number:\n\n:'''el caj\u00f3n''' (\u2019the box\u2019) \u2013 '''el maga/mana caj\u00f3n(es)''' (\u2019the boxes\u2019)\n:'''un soltero''' (\u2019a bachelor\u2019) \u2013 '''un soltera''' (\u2019a spinster\u2019)\n:'''el un soltero''' (\u2019the bachelor\u2019) \u2013 '''el un soltera''' (\u2019the spinster\u2019)\n\nNouns in Chavacano are not always preceded by articles. Without an article, a noun is a generic reference:\n\n:'''Jendeh yo ta llor\u00e1 lagrimas sino sangre'''.\n::(\u2019I do not cry tears but blood\u2019.)\n:'''Ta carg\u00e1 yo palo'''.\n::(\u2019I am carrying wood\u2019).\n\nProper names of persons are preceded by the definite article '''si''' or the phrase '''un tal''' functioning as an indefinite article would:\n\n:'''Un bonita candidata si Maria.'''.\n::(\u2019Maria is a beautiful candidate\u2019.)\n:'''un tal Juancho'''\n::(\u2019a certain Juancho\u2019)\n\n====Singular nouns====\n\nUnlike in Spanish, Chavacano [[nouns]] derived from Spanish do not follow gender rules in general. In Zamboangue\u00f1o, the [[article (grammar)|article]] 'el' basically precedes every singular noun. However, this rule is not rigid (especially in Zamboangue\u00f1o) because the formal vocabulary mode wherein Spanish words predominate almost always is the preferred mode especially in writing. The Spanish article 'la' for feminine singular nouns does exist in Chavacano, though it occurs rarely and mostly in the formal medium of writing, such as poems and lyrics. When accompanying a Spanish feminine noun, the 'la' as the article is more tolerated than acceptable.  Among the few exceptions where the 'la' occurs is as a formal prefix when addressing the Blessed Virgin Mary, perhaps more as an emphasis of her importance in Christian devotion. But the real article is still the 'el', which makes this use of a \"double article\" quite unique. Thus it is common to hear the Blessed Virgin addressed in Chavacano as 'el La Virgen Maria' (the \"L\" of the 'la' capitalized to signify its permanent position within the noun compound). In general, though, when in doubt, the article 'el' is always safe to use. Compare:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English singular noun\n!Chavacano singular noun (general and common)\n!Chavacano singular noun (accepted or uncommon)\n|-\n|the virgin\n|el virgen\n|la virgen (accepted)\n|-\n|the peace\n|el paz\n|la paz (accepted)\n|-\n|the sea\n|el mar\n|la mar (accepted)\n|-\n|the cat\n|el gato\n|el gato (la gata is uncommon)\n|-\n|the sun\n|el sol\n|el sol\n|-\n|the moon\n|el luna\n|el luna (la luna is uncommon)\n|-\n|the view\n|el vista\n|la vista (accepted)\n|-\n|the tragedy\n|el tragedia\n|el tragedia (la tragedia is uncommon)\n|-\n|the doctor\n|el doctor\n|el doctora (la doctora is uncommon)\n|}\n\nAnd just like Spanish, Chavacano nouns can have gender but only when referring to persons. However, they are always masculine in the sense (Spanish context) that they are generally preceded by the article 'el'. Places and things are almost always masculine. The -o is dropped in masculine nouns and -a is added to make the noun feminine:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English singular noun\n!Chavacano singular noun (masculine)\n!Chavacano singular noun (feminine)\n|-\n|the teacher\n|el maestro\n|el maestra\n|-\n|the witch\n|el burujo\n|el buruja\n|-\n|the engineer\n|el engeniero\n|el engeniera\n|-\n|the tailor/seamstress\n|el sastrero\n|el sastrera\n|-\n|the baby\n|el ni\u00f1o\n|el ni\u00f1a\n|-\n|the priest/nun\n|el padre / sacerdote\n|el madre / monja\n|-\n|the grandson/granddaughter\n|el nieto\n|el nieta\n|-\n|the professor\n|el profesor\n|el profesora\n|-\n|the councilor\n|el consejal\n|el consejala\n|}\n\nNot all nouns referring to persons can become feminine nouns. In Chavacano, some names of persons are masculine (because of the preceding article 'el' in Spanish context) but do not end in -o.\n\n:Examples: '''el alcalde''', '''el capitan''', '''el negociante''', '''el ayudante''', '''el chufer'''\n\nAll names of animals are always masculine\u2014in Spanish context\u2014preceded by the article 'el'.\n\n:Examples: '''el gato''' (gata is uncommon), '''el puerco''' (puerca is uncommon), '''el perro''' (perra is uncommon)\n\nNames of places and things can be either masculine or feminine, but they are considered masculine in the Spanish context because the article 'el' always precedes the noun:\n\n:'''el cocina''', '''el pantal\u00f3n''', '''el comida''', '''el camino''', '''el trapo''', '''el ventana''', '''el mar'''\n\n====Plural nouns====\n\nIn Chavacano, plural nouns (whether masculine or feminine in Spanish context) are preceded by the retained singular masculine Spanish article 'el'. The Spanish articles 'los' and 'las' have almost disappeared. They have been replaced by the modifier (a plural marker) 'maga/mana' which precedes the singular form of the noun. Maga comes from the native Hiligaynon 'maga' or the Tagalog 'mga'. The formation of the Chavacano plural form of the noun (el + maga/mana + singular noun form) applies whether in common, familiar or formal mode. It may be thought of as roughly equivalent to saying in English, \"the many (noun)\" instead of \"the (noun)s\", and in fact \"the many (noun)s\" is used more in [[Philippine English]] than elsewhere.\n\nThere are some Chavacano speakers (especially older Cavite\u00f1o or Zamboangue\u00f1o speakers) who would tend to say 'mana' for 'maga'. 'Mana' is accepted and quite common, especially among older speakers, but when in doubt, the modifier 'maga' to pluralize nouns is safer to use.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English plural noun\n!Chavacano plural noun (masculine)\n!Chavacano plural noun (feminine)\n|-\n|the teachers\n|el maga/mana maestro(s)\n|el maga/mana maestra(s)\n|-\n|the witches\n|el maga/mana burujo(s)\n|el maga/mana buruja(s)\n|-\n|the engineers\n|el maga/mana engeniero(s)\n|el maga/mana engeniera(s)\n|-\n|the tailors/seamstresses\n|el maga/mana sastrero(s)\n|el maga/mana sastrera(s)\n|-\n|the babies\n|el maga/mana ni\u00f1o(s)\n|el maga/mana ni\u00f1a(s)\n|-\n|the priests/nuns\n|el maga/mana padre(s)\n|el maga/mana madre(s)\n|-\n|the grandsons/granddaughters\n|el maga/mana nieto(s)\n|el maga/mana nieta(s)\n|-\n|the professors\n|el maga/mana professor(es)\n|el maga/mana profesora(s)\n|-\n|the councilors\n|el maga/mana consejal(es)\n|el maga/mana consejala(s)\n|}\n\nAgain, this rule is not rigid (especially in the Zamboangue\u00f1o formal mode). The articles 'los' or 'las' do exist sometimes before nouns that are pluralized in the Spanish manner, and their use is quite accepted:\n\n:'''los caballeros''', '''los dias''', '''las noches''', '''los chavacanos''', '''los santos''', '''las ma\u00f1anas''', '''las almujadas''', '''las mesas''', '''las plumas''', '''las cosas'''\n\nWhen in doubt, it is always safe to use 'el' and 'maga or mana' to pluralize singular nouns:\n\n:'''el maga/mana caballero(s)''', '''el maga/mana d\u00eda(s)''', '''el maga/mana noche(s)''', '''el maga/mana chavacano(s)''', '''el maga/mana santo(s)''', '''el maga/mana d\u00eda(s) que viene''' (this is a phrase; 'el maga/mana ma\u00f1ana' is uncommon), '''el maga/mana almujada(s)''', '''el maga/mana mesa(s)''', '''el maga/mana pluma(s)'''\n\nIn Chavacano, it is common for some nouns to become doubled when pluralized (called ''[[Reduplication]]'', a characteristic of the Malayo-Polynesian family of languages):\n\n:'''el maga cosa-cosa''' (el maga cosa/s is common), '''el maga casa casa''' (el maga casa is common), '''el maga gente gente''' (el maga gente is common), '''el maga juego juego''' (el maga juego is common)\n\nBut note that in some cases, this \"reduplication\" signifies a difference in meaning.  For example,  'el maga bata' means 'the children' but 'el maga bata-bata' means one's followers or subordinates, as is a gang or mob.\n\nIn general, the suffixes -s, -as, -os to pluralize nouns in Spanish have also almost disappeared in Chavacano. However, the formation of plural nouns with suffixes ending in -s, -as, and -os are accepted. Basically, the singular form of the noun is retained, and it becomes plural because of the preceding modifier/plural marker 'maga' or 'mana':\n\n:'''el maga/mana caballeros''' (accepted)\n:'''el maga/mana caballero''' (correct)\n:'''el maga/mana d\u00edas''' (accepted)\n:'''el maga/mana d\u00eda''' (correct)\n\nAdding the suffix -es to some nouns is quite common and accepted. Nouns ending in -cion can also be pluralized by adding the suffix -es:\n\n:'''el maga meses''', '''el maga mujeres''', '''el maga mayores''', '''el maga tentaciones''', '''el maga contestaciones''', '''el maga naciones''', '''el maga organizaciones'''\n\nHowever, it is safer to use the general rule (when in doubt) of retaining the singular form of the noun preceded by the modifier/plural marker 'maga' or 'mana':\n\n:'''el maga mes''', '''el maga mujer''', '''el maga mayor''', '''el maga tentaci\u00f3n''', '''el maga contestaci\u00f3n''', '''el maga naci\u00f3n''', '''el maga organizaci\u00f3n'''\n\n===Pronouns===\n\nChavacano pronouns are based on Spanish and native sources; many of the pronouns are not used in either but may be derived in part.\n\nIn contrast to the other varieties of Chavacano, the variety spoken in Zamboanga uses more pronouns derived from a native Philippine language (I.e. Hiligaynon) in addition to Spanish. In Zamboangue\u00f1o, there are three different levels of usage for certain pronouns depending on the level of familiarity between the speaker and the addressee, the status of both in family and society, or the mood of the speaker and addressee at the particular moment: ''common'', ''familiar'', and ''formal''. The common forms are, particularly in the second and third person plural, derived from Cebuano while most familiar and formal forms are from Spanish. The ''common forms'' are used to address a person below or of equal social or family status or to someone is who is acquainted. The common forms are used to regard no formality or courtesy in conversation. Its use can also mean rudeness, impoliteness or offensiveness. The ''familiar forms'' are used to address someone of equal social or family status. It indicates courteousness, and is commonly used in public conversations, the broadcast media, and in education. The ''formal forms'' are used to address someone older and/or higher in social or family status. It is the form used in writing.\n\nAdditionally, Zamboangue\u00f1o is the only variety of Chavacano which distinguishes between the [[inclusive and exclusive we|inclusive we]] (''kita'') \u2013 including the person spoken to (the addressee) \u2013 and the [[inclusive and exclusive we|exclusive we]] (''kame'') \u2013 excluding the person spoken to (the addressee) \u2013 in the first person plural except in the formal form where ''nosotros'' is used for both.\n\n====Personal (nominative/subjective case) pronouns====\n\nBelow is a table comparing the personal pronouns in three varieties of Chavacano.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o\n!Cavite\u00f1\n!Bahra\n!Castellano Abakay (de Davao)\n|-\n|'''1st person singular'''\n|yo\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | yo\n|yo (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\nako (Chino)\n|-\n|'''2nd person singular'''\n|[e]vo[s] (common)/(informal)<br>t\u00fa (familiar)<br>usted (formal)\n|vo/bo<br>tu<br>ust\u00e9\n|vo/bo<br>ust\u00e9\n|usted\nvos\n|-\n|'''3rd person singular'''\n|\u00e9l<br>ele\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | eli\n|\u00e9l\n|-\n|'''1st person plural'''\n|kam\u00e9 (exclusive/common/familiar)<br>kit\u00e1 (inclusive/common/familiar)<br>nosotros (formal)\n|nisos\n|mijotro<br>mihotro<br>motro\n|nosotros (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\n|-\n|'''2nd person plural'''\n|kam\u00f3 (common)<br> vosotros (familiar)<br> ustedes (formal)\n|vusos<br>busos\n|buhotro<br>bujotro<br>ustedi<br>tedi\n|ustedes\nvosotros\n|-\n|'''3rd person plural'''\n|sil\u00e1 (common/familiar)<br>ellos (formal)\n|ilos\n|lojotro<br>lohotro<br>lotro\n|ellos\n|}\n\n====Possessive pronouns (Chavacano de Zamboanga, Castellano Abakay)====\n\nThe usage modes also exist in the possessive pronouns especially in Zamboangue\u00f1o. ''Amon'', ''Aton'', ''ila'' and ''inyo'' are obviously of [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] but not [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] origins, and when used as pronouns, they are of either the common or familiar mode. The inclusive and exclusive characteristics peculiar to Zamboangue\u00f1o appear again in the 1st person plural. Below is a table of the possessive pronouns in the Chavacano de Zamboanga:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o\n!Castellano Abakay (de Davao)\n|-\n|'''1st person singular'''\n|mi<br>m\u00edo<br>de mi<br>de m\u00edo<br>di mio/di m\u00edo\n|mi\nm\u00edo\n|-\n|'''2nd person singular'''\n|de vos (''common'')<br>de tu (''familiar'')<br>tuyo (''familiar'')<br>de tuyo/di tuyo (''familiar'')<br>de usted (''formal'')\n|de tu\n|-\n|'''3rd person singular'''\n|su<br>suyo<br>de su<br>de suyo/di suyo\n|ese (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\nde iya (Chino)\n|-\n|'''1st person plural'''\n|de am\u00f3n/diamon (''common/familiar'') (exclusive)<br>de at\u00f3n/diaton (''common/familiar'') (inclusive)<br>nuestro (''formal'')<br>de/di nuestro (''formal'')\n|nuestro\n|-\n|'''2nd person plural'''\n|de i\u00f1o/di inyo (''common'')<br>de vosotros (''familiar'')<br>de ustedes (''formal'')\n|vos\n|-\n|'''3rd person plural'''\n|de ila (''common/familiar'')<br>de ellos/di ellos (''formal'')\n|de ellos\n|}\n\n===Verbs===\n\nIn Zamboangue\u00f1o, Chavacano verbs are mostly Spanish in origin. In contrast with the other varieties, there is rarely a Zamboangue\u00f1o verb that is based on or has its origin from other Philippine languages. Hence, verbs contribute much of the Spanish vocabulary in Chavacano de Zamboanga.\n\nGenerally, the simple form of the Zamboangue\u00f1o verb is based upon the infinitive of the Spanish verb, minus the final /r/. For example, ''continuar'', ''hablar'', ''poner'', ''recibir'', and ''llevar'' become ''continu\u00e1'', ''habl\u00e1'', ''pon\u00e9'', ''recib\u00ed'', and ''llev\u00e1'' with the accent called \"acento agudo\" on the final syllable.\n\nThere are some rare exceptions. Some verbs are not derived from infinitives but from words that are technically Spanish phrases or from other Spanish verbs. For example, ''dar'' (give) does not become 'da' but ''dale'' (give) (literally in Spanish, to \"give it\" [verb phrase]). In this case, ''dale'' has nothing to do with the Spanish infinitive ''dar''. The Chavacano ''brinca'' (to hop) is from Spanish ''brincar'' which means the same thing.\n\n====Verb tenses - simple tenses====\n\nChavacano of Zamboangue\u00f1o uses the words ''ya'' (from Spanish ''ya'' [already]), ''ta'' (from Spanish ''est\u00e1'' [is]), and ''ay'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o infinitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|ya cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|ay cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|ya beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|ay beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|ya dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|ay dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|ya ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|ay ped\u00ed\n|}\n\nCavite\u00f1 uses the words ''ya'', ''ta'', and ''di'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Cavite\u00f1 infinitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|ya cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|di cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|ya beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|di beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|ya dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|di dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|ya ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|di ped\u00ed\n|}\n\nWhile Bahra uses the words ''a'', ''ta'', and ''di'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Bahra ininitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|a cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|di cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|a beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|di beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|a dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|di dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|a ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|di ped\u00ed\n|}\nUnlike in the Zamboangue\u00f1o, Cavite\u00f1, and Bahra, Castellano Abakay (Davaoe\u00f1o) doesn't have the ''ya'' and ''ta'' prefix. The infinitives and their conjugations are somehow retained, and there are some that have simplified conjugations:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Castellano Abakay infinitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cantar\n|cant\u00f3\n|canta\n|cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beber\n|bib\u00edo\n|bebe\n|beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dormir\n|durmi\u00f3\n|duerme\n|dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|pedir\n|pidi\u00f3\n|pide\n|ped\u00ed\n|}\n\n=====Perfect constructions=====\n\nIn Zamboangue\u00f1o, there are three ways to express that the verb is in the [[present perfect]]. First, ''ya'' can appear both before and after the main verb to express that in the present perspective, the action has already been completed somewhere in the past with the accent falling on the final ''ya''. Second, ''ta'' and ''ya'' can appear before and after the verb respectively to express that the action was expected to happen in the past (but did not happen), is still expected to happen in the present, and actually the expectation has been met (the verb occurs in the present). And third, a verb between ''ta'' and ''pa'' means an action started in the past and still continues in the present:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o past perfect\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o present perfect\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o future perfect\n|-\n|ya cant\u00e1 ya.\n|ta cant\u00e1 pa. / ta canta ya.\n|ay cant\u00e1 ya.\n|-\n|ya beb\u00e9 ya.\n|ta beb\u00e9 pa. / ta Bebe ya.\n|ay beb\u00e9 ya.\n|-\n|ya dorm\u00ed ya.\n|ta dorm\u00ed pa. / ta dormi ya.\n|ay dorm\u00ed ya.\n|-\n|ya ped\u00ed ya.\n|ya ped\u00ed pa. / ya ped\u00ed ya.\n|ay ped\u00ed ya.\n|}\n\nThe [[past perfect]] exists in Zamboangue\u00f1o. The words ''antes'' (before) and ''despues'' (after) can be used between two sentences in the simple past form to show which verb came first. The words ''antes'' (before) and ''despues'' (after) can also be used between a sentence in the present perfect using ''ya'' + verb + ''ya'' and another sentence in the simple past tense:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Past perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Past perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ya mir\u00e1 kame el pel\u00edcula antes de ya compr\u00e1 con el maga chichir\u00edas.\n|We had watched the movie before we bought the snacks.\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Past perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Past perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ya mir\u00e1 ya kame el pel\u00edcula despu\u00e9s ya compr\u00e1 kame con el maga chichir\u00edas.\n|We had watched the movie and then we bought the snacks.\n|}\n\nZamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano uses a verb between \"hay\" and \"ya\" to denote the [[future perfect]] and [[past perfect]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Future perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Future perfect (English)\n|-\n|Hay mir\u00e1 ya kame el pel\u00edcula si hay lleg\u00e1 vosotros.\n|We will have watched the movie when you arrive.\n|}\n\nZamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano also uses a verb between \"ta\" and \"ya\" to denote the [[present perfect]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Present perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Present perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ta mir\u00e1 ya kame con el pel\u00edcula mientras ta esper\u00e1 con vosotros.\n|We are already watching the movie while waiting for you.\n|}\n\n====Passive and active voice====\n\nTo form the Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano active voice, Zamboangue\u00f1os follow the pattern:\n\n'''El maga soldao ya mata con el criminal'''\nThe soldiers killed the criminal.\n\nAs illustrated above, active (causative) voice is formed by placing the doer ''el maga soldao'' before the verb phrase ''ya mata'' and then the object ''el criminal'' as indicated by the particle ''con''\n\nTraditionally, Zamboangue\u00f1o does not have a passive construction of its own.<ref>Chabacano de Zamboanga Handbook</ref>\n\n==Archaic Spanish words and false friends==\n\nChabacano has preserved plenty of archaic Spanish phrases and words in its vocabulary that modern Spanish no longer uses; for example:\n\n:\"En denantes\" which means 'a while ago' (Spanish: \"hace un tiempo\"). Take note that \"En denantes\" is an archaic Spanish phrase. Modern Spanish would express the phrase as \"hace poco tiempo\" or \"hace un tiempo\", but Chabacano still retains this archaic Spanish phrase and many other archaic Spanish words. This word is still being used in some areas of southern Spain.\n\n:\"Masquen\"/\"Masquin\" means 'even (if)' or 'although'. In Spanish, \"mas que\" is an archaic Spanish phrase meaning 'although', nowadays replaced by the Spanish word \"aunque\".<ref>Brooks 1933, Vol. 16, 1st Ed.</ref>\n\n:In Chavacano, the Spanish language is commonly called \"castellano\". Chavacano speakers, especially older Zamboangue\u00f1os, call the language as \"castellano\" implying the original notion as the language of Castille while \"espa\u00f1ol\" is used to mean a Spaniard or a person from Spain.\n\n:The pronoun \"vos\" is alive in Chavacano. While \"vos\" was used in the highest form of respect before the 16th century in classical Spanish and is quite archaic nowadays in modern Spanish (much like the English \"thou\"), in Chavacano it is used at the common level of usage (lower than tu, which is used at the familiar level) in the same manner of [[Cervantes]] and in the same manner as in certain Latin American countries such as Argentina (informally and in contrast with usted, which is used formally). Chavacano followed the development of vos in same manner as in Latin America \u2013 (the [[voseo]]) or, incidentally, as with English \"thou\" vs. \"you\".\n\n:\"Ansina\" means 'like that' or 'that way'. In modern Spanish, \"as\u00ed\" is the evolved form of this archaic word. The word \"ansina\" can still be heard among the aged in [[Mexico]] and is the only way of expressing this meaning in [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]].\n\nOn the other hand, some words from the language spoken in Spain have evolved or have acquired totally different meanings in Chavacano. Hence, for Castillian speakers who would encounter Chavacano speakers, some words familiar to them have become [[false friends]]. Some examples of false friends are:\n\n:\"Siguro\"/\"Seguro\" means 'maybe'. In Spanish, \"seguro\" means 'sure', 'secure', or 'stable', although it could imply probability as well, as in the phrase, \"Seguramente vendr\u00e1\" (Probably he will come).\n\n:\"Siempre\" means 'of course'. In Spanish, \"siempre\" means 'always'.\n\n:\"Firmi\" means 'always'. In Spanish, \"firme\" means 'firm' or 'steady'.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Filipino language]]\n*[[Spanish-based creole languages]]\n*[[List of loanwords in Tagalog]]\n*[[Chavacano Wikipedia]]\n\n==Codes==\n:[[ISO 639-1]]: ''none''\n:[[ISO 639-2]]: '''crp'''<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n:[[ISO 639-3]]: '''cbk'''<ref name=\"SIL International\"/>\n:[[SIL code]]: '''cbk'''<ref name=\"SIL International\">SIL International</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=John|title=M\u00e1s que, mas que and mas \u00a1qu\u00e9!|journal=Hispania|volume=16|issue=1|pages=23\u201334|issn=00182133|doi=10.2307/332588|date=1 January 1933|jstor=332588}}\n*Castillo, Edwin Gabriel Ma., S.J. \"Glosario Liturgico: Liturgical Literacy in the Chavacano de Zamboanga\",(Unpublished) Archdiocese of Zamboanga.\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Chambers |editor1-first=John, S.J. |editor2-last=Wee |editor2-first=Salvador, S.J. |title=English-Chabacano Dictionary |date=2003 |publisher=Ateneo de Zamboanga University Press}}\n*Holm, J.

Nodoka suffered from a respiratory condition so her parents decided to move to help her recovery. Nodoka takes in her new surroundings, eager to help out and meet new people. While relaxing in the park, Nodoka suddenly witnesses a monster attack and upon hearing of a dog in trouble, goes off to find it. Nodoka finds the dog along with three Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran. The Animals explain that the dog is named Princess Latte and that they all come from the Healing Garden, a place in the center of the Earth that helps keep the planet healthy. However the garden is under a threat from the Bj\u00f6gens, who wants to infect the world with disease. The Bj\u00f6gen General Daruizen created the monster, known as a MegaBj\u00f6gen, by infecting an elemental spirit. The Animals were asked by Latte's mother, Queen Tiatine, to find those destined to be their partners and become the Legendary Precure and fight the Bj\u00f6gens. Latte is sensitive to the monster attacks and becomes sick when one appears. However, Nodoka's feelings of wanting to help resonate with Rabirin and allow her to transform into Cure Grace. Cure Grace then defeats the MegaBj\u00f6gen and purifies the Flower spirit, making Latte healthy again.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = No Longer Partners!?

Nodoka discovers she is in the same class as Chiyu Sawaizumi and Hinata Hiramitsu, two girls she met the previous day. After school, Nodoka is asked if she wants to join one of the sports clubs. While enthusiastic about it, Nodoka soon reveals she is poorly unskilled at everything, much to Rabirin's dismay.

In 1684, [[Zhuluo County]] was established, encompassing the underdeveloped northern two-thirds of Taiwan. Modern-day Taichung traces its beginnings to a settlement named ''Toatun'' ({{zh|t=\u5927\u58a9|p=D\u00e0d\u016bn|w=Ta<sup>4</sup>-tun<sup>1</sup>|poj=To\u0101-tun|l=large mound}}) in 1705. To strengthen Qing control, a garrison was established in 1721 near the site of present-day [[Taichung Park]] by Lan Ting-chen.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=27}}\n\nNorth of the city, on the [[Tachia River|Dajia River]], an aboriginal revolt broke out in 1731 after Chinese officials moved in and compelled them to provide labor. The revolt spread through the city as far south as [[Changhua County#Qing Dynasty|Changhua County]] in May 1732 before the rebels were chased into the mountains by Qing forces.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=22}} In 1786, another rebellion against the Qing, known as the [[Lin Shuangwen rebellion]], began as an attempt to overthrow the government and restore the [[Ming dynasty]]. Unfortunately, as the rebels moved northward, they turned to slaughter and looting. They were eventually defeated by a coalition of Qing forces, [[Hakka people|Hakka]], [[Quanzhou]] [[Fujian]]ese descendants, and aboriginal volunteers.{{sfnp|Gardella|1999|p=164}}\n\nWhen [[Taiwan Province#Qing Dynasty|Taiwan Province]] was declared an independent province in 1887, the government intended to construct its capital city at the centrally located ''Toatun'', which was also designated as the seat of [[Taiwan Prefecture]].{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=245|ps=: \"...the seat of government (which had been formerly at the old town of Taiwan-fu in the south, which city had been in turn the capital of the Dutch, Koxinga, and the Chinese,) was now removed temporarily to the new city of [[Taipei|Taipeh]], which had been lately in course of construction&nbsp;... In connection with this, it is necessary to go further and explain that it was the intention of the government to build a new capital city in the center of the island near Changwha. Accordingly, the new city was laid out and the construction of official yamens commenced. The name of the new city became Taiwan-fu, or the capital city of Taiwan (Formosa), and it was also to be the seat of a new prefecture called [[Taiwan Prefecture|Taiwan [Prefecture]]].\"}} Thus the city took the title of \"Taiwan-fu\", meaning \"capital city of Taiwan\", from modern-day [[Tainan]], which had held the title for more than 200 years. Qing official [[Liu Ming-chuan]] received permission to oversee development of the area, which included constructing a railway through the city.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|pp=247-8|ps= :\"To obtain Imperial sanction to the undertaking, Governor Liu represented to the authorities that, if the capital was removed into the interior as they had recommended, it would be necessary, as there were no roads, to construct a railway from the new capital to one of the coast ports, preferably Kelung in the north. This proposition met with sonic opposition in [[Beijing|Peking]], but eventually Imperial approbation was obtained.\" }} However, the provincial capital was ultimately moved to [[Taipei]].\n\n===Empire of Japan===\nAfter China lost the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan by the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], and the name of the city was changed to {{nihongo||\u81fa\u4e2d|Taich\u016b|lead=yes}}. The Japanese sought to develop the city to make it the first \"modern\" area of Taiwan{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=36}} and invested in roads, dams, and levees. In 1901, {{nihongo4||\u81fa\u4e2d\u5ef3|Taich\u016b Ch\u014d}} was established as one of twenty local administrative districts on the island. In 1904, the town of Taich\u016b had a population of 6,423, and Taich\u016b District had more than 207,000.{{sfnp|Takekoshi|1907|pp=199-200}}\n\n[[Taichung Park|Taich\u016b Park]] was completed in 1903.

[[Taichung Railway Station (TRA)|Taich\u016b Train Station]] was completed and began operation in 1917,<ref name=\"city_history_website\" /> and still operates today.

The city became a center of Taiwanese culture and nationalism.<ref name=\"city_history_website\" />\n\nFrom 1926 to 1945, [[Taich\u016b Prefecture]] covered modern-day Taichung as well as [[Changhua County]] and [[Nantou County]].\n\n===Republic of China===\nAt the end of the war, Japan [[History of Taiwan since 1945|handed over]] control of Taiwan. In 1947 the first Mayor of Taichung County (which included Taichung City) was Lai Tien Shen. The position was appointed by the government to rule during the interim period.

Nearly every intersection in the downtown area has signs in Hanyu Pinyin.

In 1684, [[Zhuluo County]] was established, encompassing the underdeveloped northern two-thirds of Taiwan. Modern-day Taichung traces its beginnings to a settlement named ''Toatun'' ({{zh|t=\u5927\u58a9|p=D\u00e0d\u016bn|w=Ta<sup>4</sup>-tun<sup>1</sup>|poj=To\u0101-tun|l=large mound}}) in 1705. To strengthen Qing control, a garrison was established in 1721 near the site of present-day [[Taichung Park]] by Lan Ting-chen.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=27}}\n\nNorth of the city, on the [[Tachia River|Dajia River]], an aboriginal revolt broke out in 1731 after Chinese officials moved in and compelled them to provide labor. The revolt spread through the city as far south as [[Changhua County#Qing Dynasty|Changhua County]] in May 1732 before the rebels were chased into the mountains by Qing forces.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=22}} In 1786, another rebellion against the Qing, known as the [[Lin Shuangwen rebellion]], began as an attempt to overthrow the government and restore the [[Ming dynasty]]. Unfortunately, as the rebels moved northward, they turned to slaughter and looting. They were eventually defeated by a coalition of Qing forces, [[Hakka people|Hakka]], [[Quanzhou]] [[Fujian]]ese descendants, and aboriginal volunteers.{{sfnp|Gardella|1999|p=164}}\n\nWhen [[Taiwan Province#Qing Dynasty|Taiwan Province]] was declared an independent province in 1887, the government intended to construct its capital city at the centrally located ''Toatun'', which was also designated as the seat of [[Taiwan Prefecture]].{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=245|ps=: \"...the seat of government (which had been formerly at the old town of Taiwan-fu in the south, which city had been in turn the capital of the Dutch, Koxinga, and the Chinese,) was now removed temporarily to the new city of [[Taipei|Taipeh]], which had been lately in course of construction&nbsp;... In connection with this, it is necessary to go further and explain that it was the intention of the government to build a new capital city in the center of the island near Changwha. Accordingly, the new city was laid out and the construction of official yamens commenced. The name of the new city became Taiwan-fu, or the capital city of Taiwan (Formosa), and it was also to be the seat of a new prefecture called [[Taiwan Prefecture|Taiwan [Prefecture]]].\"}} Thus the city took the title of \"Taiwan-fu\", meaning \"capital city of Taiwan\", from modern-day [[Tainan]], which had held the title for more than 200 years. Qing official [[Liu Ming-chuan]] received permission to oversee development of the area, which included constructing a railway through the city.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|pp=247-8|ps= :\"To obtain Imperial sanction to the undertaking, Governor Liu represented to the authorities that, if the capital was removed into the interior as they had recommended, it would be necessary, as there were no roads, to construct a railway from the new capital to one of the coast ports, preferably Kelung in the north.

However, there are still signs displaying spellings from previously used romanization systems, as well as [[Tongyong Pinyin]] and systems that do not conform to any standard system.<ref name=\"pinyin\">{{cite web|url=http://webeng.tccg.gov.tw/general.php?page=general_brief_01&id=15&pid=15|title=Romanization of Taichung's top 50 Main Roads|accessdate=2006-09-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206162332/http://webeng.tccg.gov.tw/general.php?page=general_brief_01&id=15&pid=15|archive-date=2006-02-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> Unlike [[Taipei]], which uses a capital letter at the beginning of every syllable, Taichung City uses the standard form of Hanyu Pinyin on street signs erected in recent years. However, the municipal website uses the Taipei system. Most major intersections have at least one sign containing some form of romanization.  Nearly every intersection in the downtown area has signs in Hanyu Pinyin. However, outside of the downtown area, while coverage by Hanyu Pinyin signs is improving, many intersections have signs in other romanization systems (especially Wade\u2013Giles and MPS2) or no Romanized signs at all.\n\n==Culture and recreation==\n\n===Museums and cultural centers===\n[[File:NTMoFA-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts]]]]\n\n*The [[National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts]] houses the world's largest collection of Taiwanese art.\n*[[National Museum of Natural Science]] together with [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]] and the [[National Science and Technology Museum]] in [[Kaohsiung]] are called \"the Museums of Taiwan\".

On May 4, 2007, Dr. Tsai presented the project plan and officially invited Mr. Tadao Ando to design an art museum for Asia University. Therefore, the main purpose of inviting Tadao Ando to design the museum was to educate students and create the opportunity for them to have contact with art works from masters of international status. This museum provides various and amazing exhibitions which are related to Asian art and modern art.\n\n===Temples===\n{{Main|Temples of Taichung}}\nTemples can be found all over the city of Taichung.
