There are any number ways of winning - and hopefully there'll be any number of ways of losing too.\"<ref name=prerelease /> ''Robin Hood'' was created using a custom adventure-creation [[Game engine|engine]] created by Grand, titled ''Gulliver'', and formerly titled ''Microcosm''.<ref name=prerelease />\n\nGrand cites the ''Gulliver'' engine's [[Non-player character|NPC]] management as an advantage that it has over other engines, stating that \"All the people [in the game] are behaving consistently all the time, they're all there, they're all doing things off stage. It's not like rooms [which] disappear when you're not in them.\" Grand furthermore notes how NPCs 'notice' other NPCs and interact with one another, expressing that \"What's clever about it is that there are 40 people in there who can see or not see, hear or not hear eachother [''sic''] - that's proper interaction and the system doesn't cheat.\"<ref name=prerelease /> Every [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] in ''Robin Hood'' is marked with AI routines, and Grand states that \"The whole system is object oriented, they've all got their own [[Logic programming|rule bases]].\"<ref name=prerelease /> At that stage of development, ''Robin Hood'' was stated to be coded with 600 rules, with this number projected to 'about 1,500' when the game was finished.<ref name=prerelease /> Each of the 'around forty' characters and objects in ''Robin Hood'' have AI routines for different scenarios, and every sprite has 32 attributes.<ref name=prerelease /> In the case of characters, these attributes are stated by Grand to \"make up their soul\", and determine factors such as \"how hungry they are, how optimistic they're feeling, who they like, [and] what sort of people they are\".<ref name=prerelease /> The values for these attributes change frequently due to every decision being determined by one or more attributes, and these decisions are impacted by what characters are nearby.<ref name=prerelease /> Grand expresses that his long-term goal for ''Robin Hood'' was for it feel like an [[open world]] game, stating that \"Ultimately what I want to do is write a computer game with no plot in it whatsoever. I just want to build the world and put the people in it so that you can do whatever you want to do.\"<ref name=prerelease />\n\n''Robin Hood'' has a total of 64 different locations, and Grand expresses that while \"[[Isometric video game graphics|Isometric]] [graphics are] a bit dated\", \"it's a good way of getting 3D on the cheap. At the moment the system can't do [[First-person (video games)|first person]] 3D fast enough - even now about 90 percent of the processing time is just taken up by plotting screens.\"<ref name=prerelease /> Memory restrictions were noted as a difficulty in ''Robin Hood's'' development, and an example is given of a [[swan]] that 'doubles as' a [[coffin]]; if a character dies and the coffin is loaded into memory, the swan disappears.<ref name=prerelease /> ''Robin Hood's'' graphics were first drafted by Steve Grand, and then finalized by graphic artist Robin Chapman.<ref name=prerelease>{{cite magazine|title = Making Merry|date = April 1991|url = https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-31/page/n19/mode/2up|magazine = The One|publisher = emap Images|last = Hamza|first = Kati|issue = 31|pages = 20\u201322}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| rev1 = ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]''\n| rev1Score = 820/1000 (MS-DOS)<ref name=ACE />\n| rev2 = ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]''\n| rev2Score = 80% (Amiga)<ref name=theone />\n}}\n\nReviewer [[Gary Whitta]] gave the PC version 820 out of a possible 1000 points, praising the graphics, controls and sense of involvement.<ref name=ACE>Whitta, Gary (October 1991).

''The One'' praises the game's flavor text and sense of humour, expressing that humour \"is very difficult to achieve in a computer game\". ''The One'' compares the game's graphics to ''Populous'', but states that the gameplay is dissimilar, as \"the map is much smaller and the action is directed towards achieving one specific goal.\" ''The One'' also praises the amount of content and ''Robin Hood's'' replayability, noting the amount of dialogue with NPCs and the ability to solve puzzles differently. ''The One'' criticises the amount of time it takes to get to different locations, saying that \"it can be annoying waiting for Robin to cross from one side of the map to the other, particularly because he can only walk in four directions.\"<ref name=theone>{{cite magazine|title = Review|date = September 1991|url = https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-36/page/n65|magazine = The One|first = Gordon|last = Houghton|publisher = emap Images|issue = 36|pages = 66\u201367}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*Upchurch, David (July 1991).

There are any number ways of winning - and hopefully there'll be any number of ways of losing too.\"<ref name=prerelease /> ''Robin Hood'' was created using a custom adventure-creation [[Game engine|engine]] created by Grand, titled ''Gulliver'', and formerly titled ''Microcosm''.<ref name=prerelease />\n\nGrand cites the ''Gulliver'' engine's [[Non-player character|NPC]] management as an advantage that it has over other engines, stating that \"All the people [in the game] are behaving consistently all the time, they're all there, they're all doing things off stage. It's not like rooms [which] disappear when you're not in them.\" Grand furthermore notes how NPCs 'notice' other NPCs and interact with one another, expressing that \"What's clever about it is that there are 40 people in there who can see or not see, hear or not hear eachother [''sic''] - that's proper interaction and the system doesn't cheat.\"<ref name=prerelease /> Every [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] in ''Robin Hood'' is marked with AI routines, and Grand states that \"The whole system is object oriented, they've all got their own [[Logic programming|rule bases]].\"<ref name=prerelease /> At that stage of development, ''Robin Hood'' was stated to be coded with 600 rules, with this number projected to 'about 1,500' when the game was finished.<ref name=prerelease /> Each of the 'around fourty' characters and objects in ''Robin Hood'' have AI routines for different scenarios, and every sprite has 32 attributes.<ref name=prerelease /> In the case of characters, these attributes are stated by Grand to \"make up their soul\", and determine factors such as \"how hungry they are, how optimistic they're feeling, who they like, [and] what sort of people they are\".<ref name=prerelease /> The values for these attributes change frequently due to every decision being determined by one or more attributes, and these decisions are impacted by what characters are nearby.<ref name=prerelease /> Grand expresses that his long-term goal for ''Robin Hood'' was for it feel like an [[open world]] game, stating that \"Ultimately what I want to do is write a computer game with no plot in it whatsoever. I just want to build the world and put the people in it so that you can do whatever you want to do.\"<ref name=prerelease />\n\n''Robin Hood'' has a total of 64 different locations, and Grand expresses that while \"[[Isometric video game graphics|Isometric]] [graphics are] a bit dated\", \"it's a good way of getting 3D on the cheap. At the moment the system can't do [[First-person (video games)|first person]] 3D fast enough - even now about 90 percent of the processing time is just taken up by plotting screens.\"<ref name=prerelease /> Memory restrictions were noted as a difficulty in ''Robin Hood's'' development, and an example is given of a [[swan]] that 'doubles as' a [[coffin]]; if a character dies and the coffin is loaded into memory, the swan disappears.<ref name=prerelease /> ''Robin Hood's'' graphics were first drafted by Steve Grand, and then finalized by graphic artist Robin Chapman.<ref name=prerelease>{{cite magazine|title = Making Merry|date = April 1991|url = https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-31/page/n19/mode/2up|magazine = The One|publisher = emap Images|last = Hamza|first = Kati|issue = 31|pages = 20\u201322}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| rev1 = ''[[ACE (magazine)|ACE]]''\n| rev1Score = 820/1000 (MS-DOS)<ref name=ACE />\n| rev2 = ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]''\n| rev2Score = 80% (Amiga)<ref name=theone />\n}}\n\nReviewer [[Gary Whitta]] gave the PC version 820 out of a possible 1000 points, praising the graphics, controls and sense of involvement.<ref name=ACE>Whitta, Gary (October 1991).

''The One'' praises the game's flavor text and sense of humour, expressing that humour \"is very difficult to achieve in a computer game\". ''The One'' compares the game's graphics to ''Populous'', but states that the gameplay is dissimilar, as \"the map is much smaller and the action is directed towards achieving one specific goal.\" ''The One'' also praises the amount of content and ''Robin Hood's'' replayability, noting the amount of dialogue with NPCs and the ability to solve puzzles differently. ''The One'' criticises the amount of time it takes to get to different locations, saying that \"it can be annoying waiting for Robin to cross from one side of the map to the other, particularly because he can only walk in four directions.\"<ref name=theone>{{cite magazine|title = Review|date = September 1991|url = https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-36/page/n65|magazine = The One|first = Gordon|last = Houghton|publisher = emap Images|issue = 36|pages = 66\u201367}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*Upchurch, David (July 1991).

For the purposes of this list eligible cars are defined in the [[List of fastest production cars#List rules|list's rules]]. This list uses a different definition to the [[List of automotive superlatives]]. The variation is because the term [[production car]] is otherwise undefined.\n\n== List rules ==\n{{See|List of automotive superlatives}}\nBecause of the inconsistencies with the various definitions of production cars, dubious claims by manufacturers and self-interest groups, and inconsistent or changing application of the definitions this list has a defined set of requirements. For further explanation of how these were arrived at see the above link.\n\n=== Post 1945 and over {{convert|124|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} only ===\nThis list is also limited to post [[World War II]] production road cars which reached more than {{convert|124|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}, older cars are excluded even if they were faster. The Benz Velo as the first petrol driven car is the only exception.\n\n=== Production car definition ===\nFor the purposes of this list, a production car is defined as a vehicle that is:\n\n# constructed principally for retail sale to consumers, for their personal use, to transport people on public roads (no commercial or industrial vehicles are eligible)\n# available for commercial sale to the public in the same specification as the vehicle used to achieve the record\n# manufactured in the record-claiming specification by a manufacturer whose WMI number is shown on the VIN, including vehicles that are modified by either professional tuners or others that result in a VIN with a WMI number in their name (for example, if a Porsche-based car is remanufactured by RUF and has RUF's WMI W09, it is eligible; but if it has Porsche's WMI, WP0, it is not eligible)\n# pre-1981 vehicles must be made by the original vehicle manufacturer and not modified by either professional tuners or individuals\n# street-legal in its intended markets, having fulfilled the homologation tests or inspections required under either a) United States of America, b) European Union law, or (c) Japan) to be granted this status\n# sold in more than one national market.\n\n=== Measurement of top speed ===\nTo establish the top speed for cars at least since the 1990s the requirement is, in addition to the above, an independent road test with a two-way run. The mean of the top speed for both runs is taken as the car's top speed.<ref name=\"Nunez_20140224\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fia.com/sports/fia-world-land-speed-records |title=FIA World Land Speed Records |publisher=Federation Internationale de l'Automobile |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101124551/https://www.fia.com/sports/fia-world-land-speed-records |archive-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> In instances where the top speed has been determined by removing the limiter, the test met these requirements, and the car is sold with the limiter on then the limited speed is accepted as meeting this requirement. For the ''McLaren F1'' the estimation by ''Car and Driver'' about the speed at the rev-limiter is used.\n\n== Record-breaking production vehicles ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

For the purposes of this list eligible cars are defined in the [[List of fastest production cars#List rules|list's rules]]. This list uses a different definition to the [[List of automotive superlatives]]. The variation is because the term [[production car]] is otherwise undefined.\n\n== List rules ==\n{{See|List of automotive superlatives}}\nBecause of the inconsistencies with the various definitions of production cars, dubious claims by manufacturers and self-interest groups, and inconsistent or changing application of the definitions this list has a defined set of requirements. For further explanation of how these were arrived at see the above link.\n\n=== Post 1945 and over {{convert|124|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} only ===\nThis list is also limited to post [[World War II]] production road cars which reached more than {{convert|124|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}, older cars are excluded even if they were faster. The Benz Velo as the first petrol driven car is the only exception.\n\n=== Production car definition ===\nFor the purposes of this list, a production car is defined as a vehicle that is:\n\n# constructed principally for retail sale to consumers, for their personal use, to transport people on public roads (no commercial or industrial vehicles are eligible)\n# available for commercial sale to the public in the same specification as the vehicle used to achieve the record\n# manufactured in the record-claiming specification by a manufacturer whose WMI number is shown on the VIN, including vehicles that are modified by either professional tuners or others that result in a VIN with a WMI number in their name (for example, if a Porsche-based car is remanufactured by RUF and has RUF's WMI W09, it is eligible; but if it has Porsche's WMI, WP0, it is not eligible)\n# pre-1981 vehicles must be made by the original vehicle manufacturer and not modified by either professional tuners or individuals\n# street-legal in its intended markets, having fulfilled the homologation tests or inspections required under either a) United States of America, b) European Union law, or (c) Japan) to be granted this status\n# sold in more than one national market.\n\n=== Measurement of top speed ===\nTo establish the top speed for cars at least since the 1990s the requirement is, in addition to the above, an independent road test with a two-way run. The mean of the top speed for both runs is taken as the car's top speed.<ref name=\"Nunez_20140224\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fia.com/sports/fia-world-land-speed-records |title=FIA World Land Speed Records |publisher=Federation Internationale de l'Automobile |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101124551/https://www.fia.com/sports/fia-world-land-speed-records |archive-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> In instances where the top speed has been determined by removing the limiter, the test met these requirements, and the car is sold with the limiter on then the limited speed is accepted as meeting this requirement.

A one-woman show, it has been performed by a number of female singers/actors, most notably [[Marti Webb]]. A one-act [[song cycle]], it tells the story of an ordinary [[English people|English]] girl from [[Muswell Hill]], who journeys to the United States in search of love. Her romantic misadventures begin in [[New York City]], lead her to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], and eventually take her back to [[Manhattan]].\n\n==Background==\nThe musical is based on an idea originally conceived by [[Tim Rice]], who intended to develop it as a cycle of television shows with songwriting partner Andrew Lloyd Webber. The two relished working on a small-scale project following ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]''. Shortly after they began working, however, Lloyd Webber realized Rice was writing specifically for [[Elaine Paige]], with whom the married father of two young children was having a blatant affair. Lloyd Webber felt that allowing Paige to appear in the series would suggest he approved of the relationship, so he decided to look for a new lyricist. He opted for [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] who, following a successful stint in Hollywood (including an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for [[Born Free (song)|\"Born Free\"]]), had begun writing for the theatre. Although it had proven to be unsuccessful, his ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy (musical)|Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'' had impressed Lloyd Webber, who thought Black would be a good match.<ref>Citron, Stephen. ''Sondheim & Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical''. New York, New York: Oxford University Press 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-509601-0}} pp. 262-63</ref>\n\nRice's original concept had kept 'the girl' in the UK. It was Black who suggested she emigrate to the States. He quickly began writing lyrics for several tunes Lloyd Webber already had composed. It was their intent to present as complete a work as possible at the [[Sydmonton Festival]] in September 1979. The two decided to cast [[Marti Webb]], who was portraying [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] at the matinee performances of ''Evita'', as their heroine,<ref>Citron, p. 264</ref> and the show was first presented at the [[Sydmonton Festival]] in 1979.\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Original album and broadcast===\nThe positive reception at Sydmonton led to the show being recorded as an [[Tell Me on a Sunday (1980 album)|album]]. Following this, a special performance was filmed at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in London on 28 January 1980, and later broadcast on the [[BBC]] on 12 February. The broadcast was a critical success and garnered high ratings, leading it to be repeated the following month.<ref>Citron, p. 266</ref> Following its transmission, the album reached #2 on the UK charts, and the single release of \"[[Take That Look Off Your Face]]\" reached #3. This success propelled [[Marti Webb]] into a household name, despite being in the theatrical business for twenty years. She followed this with a number of her own albums and two further top 20 singles.\n\n===''Song and Dance''===\n{{main|Song and Dance}}\nLloyd Webber decided the piece could work well on the stage if paired with another one-act piece. He previously had considered writing a brief operatic piece about the friendship between [[Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo]], going so far as to compose a melody that would later become [[Memory (Cats song)|\"Memory\"]], but decided it would not fit well with 'the girl's' saga. He tried adapting the [[Charles Dickens]] work ''[[The Signal-Man]]'', but decided it was too gloomy and rejected it as well. Eventually he and Black set aside ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' and turned to other projects.<ref>Citron, p.266-67</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the creative team decided to combine ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' with a [[ballet]] choreographed to Lloyd Webber's ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]'', a classical piece based on the A Minor Caprice No. 24 by [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini|Paganini]] that had debuted at Sydmonton in 1977. Following some revisions, including a new song \"The Last Man in My Life\" and several changes to the lyrics, ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' became Act I of ''[[Song and Dance]]'', which was staged at the [[West End theatre|West End]] with Marti Webb again starring as 'the girl'. Over the course of its run, she was succeeded by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Gemma Craven]], [[Liz Robertson]], and [[Sarah Brightman]].\n\nThree years later, lyricist [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] was brought in to help adapt the show for an American audience, in anticipation of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run. [[Bernadette Peters]] was chosen for the role of 'the girl', who was now renamed Emma. It opened on 18 September 1985 to mixed reviews. Writing in the ''[[New York Post]]'', [[Clive Barnes (critic)|Clive Barnes]] thought it was \"the best thing that Lloyd Webber has written for the theater,\" but [[Frank Rich]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' was not impressed, observing that \"empty material remains empty, no matter how talented those who perform it. Emma is a completely synthetic, not to mention insulting, creation whom no performer could redeem.\"<ref>Citron, p. 309</ref> Peters went on to win the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]], but the show failed to win Best Musical or Best Original Score. Black, unimpressed that Peters had insisted on gathering background information about the character, later said he preferred the original London production and Webb's performance.<ref>Inverne, James, ''Wrestling With Elephants: The Authorised Biography of Don Black''. London: Sanctuary Publishing Ltd. 2003. {{ISBN|1-86074-468-0}}, p. 137</ref>\n\n===Subsequent productions as a stand-alone piece===\nReverting to its one-act format, ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' was substantially rewritten, with five new songs and additional material by [[Jackie Clune]], for a 2003 London production at the [[Gielgud Theatre]]. The BBC critic observed, \"this may be the smallest show Lloyd Webber's ever written, but the score (to appropriately conversational lyrics by Don Black) contains several of his very best songs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/entertainment/theatre/tellme_160403.shtml|title=BBC - London - Entertainment - Theatre - Tell Me On A Sunday, a first night review -|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Directed by Christopher Luscombe and starring [[Denise Van Outen]], it ran for ten months.

A one-woman show, it has been performed by a number of female singers/actors, most notably [[Marti Webb]]. A one-act [[song cycle]], it tells the story of an ordinary [[English people|English]] girl from [[Muswell Hill]], who journeys to the United States in search of love. Her romantic misadventures begin in [[New York City]], lead her to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], and eventually take her back to [[Manhattan]].\n\n==Background==\nThe musical is based on an idea originally conceived by [[Tim Rice]], who intended to develop it as a cycle of television shows with songwriting partner Andrew Lloyd Webber. The two relished working on a small-scale project following ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]''. Shortly after they began working, however, Lloyd Webber realized Rice was writing specifically for [[Elaine Paige]], with whom the married father of two young children was having a blatant affair. Lloyd Webber felt that allowing Paige to appear in the series would suggest he approved of the relationship, so he decided to look for a new lyricist. He opted for [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] who, following a successful stint in Hollywood (including an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for [[Born Free (song)|\"Born Free\"]]), had begun writing for the theatre. Although it had proven to be unsuccessful, his ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy (musical)|Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'' had impressed Lloyd Webber, who thought Black would be a good match.<ref>Citron, Stephen. ''Sondheim & Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical''. New York, New York: Oxford University Press 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-509601-0}} pp. 262-63</ref>\n\nRice's original concept had kept 'the girl' in the UK. It was Black who suggested she emigrate to the States. He quickly began writing lyrics for several tunes Lloyd Webber already had composed. It was their intent to present as complete a work as possible at the [[Sydmonton Festival]] in September 1979. The two decided to cast [[Marti Webb]], who was portraying [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] at the matinee performances of ''Evita'', as their heroine,<ref>Citron, p. 264</ref> and the show was first presented at the [[Sydmonton Festival]] in 1979.\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Original album and broadcast===\nThe positive reception at Sydmonton led to the show being recorded as an [[Tell Me on a Sunday (1980 album)|album]]. Following this, a special performance was filmed at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in London on 28 January 1980, and later broadcast on the [[BBC]] on 12 February. The broadcast was a critical success and garnered high ratings, leading it to be repeated the following month.<ref>Citron, p. 266</ref> Following its transmission, the album reached #2 on the UK charts, and the single release of \"[[Take That Look Off Your Face]]\" reached #3. This success propelled [[Marti Webb]] into a household name, despite being in the theatrical business for twenty years. She followed this with a number of her own albums and two further top 20 singles.\n\n===''Song and Dance''===\n{{main|Song and Dance}}\nLloyd Webber decided the piece could work well on the stage if paired with another one-act piece. He previously had considered writing a brief operatic piece about the friendship between [[Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo]], going so far as to compose a melody that would later become [[Memory (Cats song)|\"Memory\"]], but decided it would not fit well with 'the girl's' saga. He tried adapting the [[Charles Dickens]] work ''[[The Signal-Man]]'', but decided it was too gloomy and rejected it as well. Eventually he and Black set aside ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' and turned to other projects.<ref>Citron, p.266-67</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the creative team decided to combine ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' with a [[ballet]] choreographed to Lloyd Webber's ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]'', a classical piece based on the A Minor Caprice No. 24 by [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini|Paganini]] that had debuted at Sydmonton in 1977. Following some revisions, including a new song \"The Last Man in My Life\" and several changes to the lyrics, ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' became Act I of ''[[Song and Dance]]'', which was staged at the [[West End theatre|West End]] with Marti Webb again starring as 'the girl'. Over the course of its run, she was succeeded by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Gemma Craven]], [[Liz Robertson]], and [[Sarah Brightman]].\n\nThree years later, lyricist [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] was brought in to help adapt the show for an American audience, in anticipation of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run. [[Bernadette Peters]] was chosen for the role of 'the girl', who was now renamed Emma. It opened on 18 September 1985 to mixed reviews. Writing in the ''[[New York Post]]'', [[Clive Barnes (critic)|Clive Barnes]] thought it was \"the best thing that Lloyd Webber has written for the theater,\" but [[Frank Rich]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' was not impressed, observing that \"empty material remains empty, no matter how talented those who perform it. Emma is a completely synthetic, not to mention insulting, creation whom no performer could redeem.\"<ref>Citron, p. 309</ref> Peters went on to win the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]], but the show failed to win Best Musical or Best Original Score. Black, unimpressed that Peters had insisted on gathering background information about the character, later said he preferred the original London production and Webb's performance.<ref>Inverne, James, ''Wrestling With Elephants: The Authorised Biography of Don Black''. London: Sanctuary Publishing Ltd. 2003. {{ISBN|1-86074-468-0}}, p. 137</ref>\n\n===Subsequent productions as a stand-alone piece===\nReverting to its one-act format, ''Tell Me on a Sunday'' was substantially rewritten, with five new songs and additional material by [[Jackie Clune]], for a 2003 London production at the [[Gielgud Theatre]]. The BBC critic observed, \"this may be the smallest show Lloyd Webber's ever written, but the score (to appropriately conversational lyrics by Don Black) contains several of his very best songs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/entertainment/theatre/tellme_160403.shtml|title=BBC - London - Entertainment - Theatre - Tell Me On A Sunday, a first night review -|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Directed by Christopher Luscombe and starring [[Denise Van Outen]], it ran for ten months.
