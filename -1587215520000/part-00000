He was the first arachnologist and conchologist, and provided an unprecedented picture of a seventeenth-century virtuoso. Lister is recognized for his discovery of [[Ballooning (spider)|ballooning spider]]s and as the father of [[conchology]], but it is less well known that he invented the [[histogram]], provided Newton with alloys, and donated the first significant natural history collections to the Ashmolean Museum. Just as Lister was the first to make a systematic study of spiders and their webs, this biography is the first to analyze the significant webs of knowledge, patronage, and familial and gender relationships that governed his life as a scientist and physician. His principal works were ''Historiae animalium Angliae tres tractatus'' (1678) which was the first organised, systematic publication on shells;<ref>[http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/nat_hist&CISOPTR=2392&REC=4 Historiae Conchyliorum, Vol. 1 and 2 (1685)] \u2013 digital facsimile, Linda Hall Library]</ref> ''Historiae Conchyliorum'' (1685 1692), and ''Conchyliorum Bivalvium'' (1696). As a [[conch]]ologist he was held in high esteem, but while he recognised the similarity of [[fossil]] [[mollusc]]a to living forms, he regarded them as inorganic imitations produced in the rocks.

It travels through the states of [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], serving several large cities on the U.S. West Coast, including [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Seattle]]. It is the only continuous Interstate highway to touch both the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican]] and the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canadian]] borders. Upon crossing the Mexican border at its southern terminus, I-5 continues to [[Tijuana]], Baja California, as [[Mexico Federal Highway 1]] (Fed.&nbsp;1). Upon crossing the Canadian border at its northern terminus, it continues to [[Vancouver]] as [[British Columbia Highway 99]] (BC&nbsp;99).\n\nI-5 was originally created in 1956 as part of the Interstate Highway System, but it was predated by several auto trails and highways built in the early 20th century. The Pacific Highway auto trail was built in the 1910s and 1920s by the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, and was later incorporated into [[U.S. Route 99]] (US&nbsp;99) in 1926. I-5 largely follows the route of US&nbsp;99, with the exception of a portion in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of California. The freeway was built in segments between 1956 and 1978, including expressway sections of US&nbsp;99 that were built earlier to bypass various towns along the route.\n\n==Route description==\n{{lengths table|length_ref=<ref name=\"fhwa\" />}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in California|CA]]\n|{{convert|796.53|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in Oregon|OR]]\n|{{convert|308.14|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in Washington|WA]]\n|{{convert|276.62|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|Total\n|{{convert|1381.29|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|}\n\n===California===\n[[File:Interstate5newhallpass.JPG|thumb|right|I-5 in the [[Newhall Pass Interchange]] where it intersects with [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|I-210]] and [[California State Route 14|State Route 14]] near [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] ]]\n{{main|Interstate 5 in California}}\nThe southernmost point of I-5 is at the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican border]] at the [[San Ysidro Port of Entry]], one of the busiest border crossings in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-005.html |title=Busiest border crossing |publisher=Interstate-guide.com |date= |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|failed=y|date=March 2014}}</ref> Beginning at the border in [[San Ysidro, San Deigeo|San Ysidro]] which is part of the city of [[San Diego]], as the [[John J. Montgomery Freeway]], I-5 goes through the suburbs of [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] and [[National City, California|National City]] before reaching downtown San Diego. It then parallels the Pacific coastline, going through the northern suburbs of San Diego, bisecting the [[University of California, San Diego]] campus, and passing the I-805 merge (where it becomes the widest Interstate in the United States for a short stretch), before passing through several [[North County (San Diego area)|North County]] coastal suburbs and then through {{convert|18|mi|km}} of [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] Base [[Camp Pendleton, California|Camp Pendleton]] in northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]]. Here I-5 is also known as the San Diego Freeway.\n\nAt [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]], I-5 turns inland and heads due north through [[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo]] to the [[El Toro Y]] interchange in southeastern [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]. I-5 becomes the [[Santa Ana Freeway]] as it runs southeast to northwest, passing through major cities and suburbs in [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and [[Los Angeles County, California|Southern Los Angeles]] counties. Southern Californians often refer to it as \"the 5\" or as the Santa Ana Freeway in the Los Angeles area. From this point, the San Diego Freeway continues northward as I-405.\n\nWhen the freeway reaches the [[East Los Angeles Interchange]] {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} east of downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], I-5 becomes the [[Golden State Freeway]]. The route continues through the [[San Fernando Valley]] and then crosses the [[Newhall Pass]] through the [[Santa Susana Mountains]] into the [[Santa Clarita Valley]]. The interchange with [[California State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14) is unusual in that truck traffic is separated into its own lanes for both the mainline of the freeway and the transition ramps to and from SR&nbsp;14. For about a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} stretch between the Santa Clarita Valley and [[Pyramid Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Pyramid Lake]], the northbound and southbound lanes separate and cross sides, with the southbound lanes running to the east of the northbound ones. At that point, the Golden State Freeway rises sharply to the north through [[Ridge Route#Features|the Grapevine]] to eventually reach the second-highest point of its entire length, the [[Tejon Pass]] (elevation {{convert|4144|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Through the [[Tehachapi Mountains]]. [[Path 26]] [[electric power transmission|power lines]] generally follow the freeway along this stretch. The freeway then descends sharply for {{convert|12|mi|km}} at Tejon Pass to around {{convert|1500|ft|m}} at Grapevine near the southernmost point of the [[San Joaquin Valley]], approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} south from where [[California State Route 99|SR&nbsp;99]] splits away from it in [[Wheeler Ridge, California|Wheeler Ridge]].\n\n[[File:I-5 near Shasta.jpg|thumb|left|I-5 south approaching Weed and Mount Shasta]]\n\nFrom SR&nbsp;99 to south of [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], I-5 skirts along the far more remote western edge of the great [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], and thus here is removed from population centers such as [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]; other state highways provide these connections. This part of I-5 is known as the West Side Freeway, and is a major connector between the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and Southern California. [[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]] splits from I-5 at a point south of Tracy as the West Side Freeway Scenic Byway, the last stretch of the West Side Freeway\u2014providing a loop-route connection to the San Francisco Bay Area. East of Tracy, I-5 intersects with I-205, another freeway that links I-5 to the Bay Area and passes through Tracy. After passing Tracy, I-5 heads north through [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] before turning west to [[Woodland, California|Woodland]]. At Woodland, the Interstate heads northwest again towards [[Dunnigan, California|Dunnigan]], where it converges with [[Interstate 505|I-505]].\n\nFrom Dunnigan, I-5 skirts north along the western edge of the [[Sacramento Valley]] to [[Red Bluff, California|Red Bluff]]. I-5 then enters the [[Shasta Cascade]] region, passing through [[Redding, California|Redding]] and [[Shasta Lake]] before climbing up to near the foot of [[Mount Shasta]]. The interstate then travels to [[Weed, California|Weed]] and [[Yreka, California|Yreka]] before reaching the Oregon border.\n\n===Oregon===\n{{main|Interstate 5 in Oregon}}\n[[File:I5inPortlandNight.jpg|right|thumb|I-5 running adjacent to the [[Willamette River]] and passes by the [[Moda Center]], and [[Oregon Convention Center]] in Downtown Portland]]\nAbout {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} north of the California border, the highway crosses {{convert|4310|ft|m}} [[Siskiyou Summit]], the highest point on I-5, and then drops down into the [[Rogue Valley]] through Oregon's southern mountains and towns such as [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]] and [[Grants Pass, Oregon|Grants Pass]]. Turning north across three passes to the Umpqua Valley and through [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], the mountains tend to turn into hills, and as it reaches Cottage Grove, the road enters the [[Willamette Valley|Willamette River Valley]]. At [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] the highway intersects [[Oregon Route 126|I-105]], a short spur route into Downtown [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. Some city highways intersect on I-5 in the Eugene Metro. The Interstate then heads almost due north, skirting [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] and [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], passing through [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], and crossing through [[Woodburn, Oregon|Woodburn]]. There were plans to build a spur, called [[Interstate 305 (Oregon)|I-305]], into Salem. I-5 covers {{convert|308|mi|km}} in [[Oregon]].\n\nJust north of Salem, between mile markers 259 and 260 just short of mile marker 260, signs in the median and on both shoulders mark the place where the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] crosses I-5. It reads \"45th Parallel half way between the Equator and the North Pole\".\n\nThe highway then tracks a little to the northeast, and [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]] splits off south of the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] metro area. From here I-5 passes through Tualatin and Tigard along former [[U.S. Route 99W (Oregon)|U.S. Route 99W]] (US&nbsp;99W) before hitting the southern terminus of [[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|I-405]] and the [[Marquam Bridge]]. Also planned was a spur in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] off I-405, called [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|I-505]], but it was never built and has been removed from city plans. A stub of I-505 exists as a long exit ramp to [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]].\n\nAfter crossing the Willamette River on the [[Marquam Bridge]], I-5 has junctions at the western end of [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] and the northern end of I-405. It then continues through the northern parts of the city of Portland, and crosses into Washington via the [[Interstate Bridge]].\n\n===Washington===\n{{main|Interstate 5 in Washington}}\n[[File:SeattleI5Skyline.jpg|thumb|right|I-5 passing through downtown Seattle]]\nThe highway continues over the [[Columbia River]] and drops down into the city of [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]]. About {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} into the state, it reaches the northern terminus of [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]], which is on the eastern edge of the Portland\u2013Vancouver metropolitan area. It then tracks north by northwest through [[Woodland, Washington|Woodland]] to [[Kelso, Washington|Kelso]] and [[Longview, Washington|Longview]], at which point it ceases to parallel a large bend of the Columbia River. Continuing north between the [[Willapa Hills]] and the Cascade foothills, the freeway eventually reaches [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], where it bends sharply east. The highway passes through the northern end of [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord]] (formerly [[Fort Lewis]] and [[McChord Field|McChord Air Force Base]]) and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], where it bends sharply north again to reach [[Seattle]]. The [[Ship Canal Bridge]] carries it over [[Portage Bay]] in Seattle. The freeway continues north out of the Seattle\u2013Tacoma\u2013[[Everett, Washington|Everett]] metro area, crosses the floodplains of three rivers, through the Skagit Valley and the Mount Vernon\u2013Burlington Metropolitan Area to the northern city of [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], to arrive at the [[Peace Arch]] Canada\u2013US border crossing between [[Blaine, Washington]], and [[Surrey, British Columbia]]. [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] continues northwest from the border into [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC]].

By the 1820s, trappers from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] were the first non-Native Americans to use the route of today's I-5 to move between today's Washington State and California. During the second half of the 19th century, mule trains, stagecoaches, and the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] railroad also followed the route of the Siskiyou Trail.<ref name=\"siskiyou\" /> By the early 20th century, pioneering automobile roads were built along the path of the Siskiyou Trail, notably the [[Pacific Highway (United States)|Pacific Highway]]. The Pacific Highway ran from [[British Columbia]] to [[San Diego]], California, and was the immediate predecessor of much of [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]]. The route of US&nbsp;99 was in turn used as a basis for much of the route of today's I-5.\n\nA major deviation from the old US&nbsp;99 route is the Westside Freeway portion of I-5 in California's Central Valley. To provide a faster and more direct north\u2013south route through the state, the decision was made to build a new freeway to the west and bypass [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], and the rest of population centers in the area instead of upgrading the existing highway (which was re-designated as part of [[California State Route 99|SR&nbsp;99]]).<ref name=\"cahighways_5\"/>\nThis re-route through California's Central Valley was the last section of I-5 to be constructed, with the final segment dedicated and opened to traffic near [[Stockton, California]], on October 12, 1979.

It travels through the states of [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], serving several large cities on the U.S. West Coast, including [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Seattle]]. It is the only continuous Interstate highway to touch both the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican]] and the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canadian]] borders. Upon crossing the Mexican border at its southern terminus, I-5 continues to [[Tijuana]], Baja California, as [[Mexico Federal Highway 1]] (Fed.&nbsp;1). Upon crossing the Canadian border at its northern terminus, it continues to [[Vancouver]] as [[British Columbia Highway 99]] (BC&nbsp;99).\n\nI-5 was originally created in 1956 as part of the Interstate Highway System, but it was predated by several auto trails and highways built in the early 20th century. The Pacific Highway auto trail was built in the 1910s and 1920s by the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, and was later incorporated into [[U.S. Route 99]] (US&nbsp;99) in 1926. I-5 largely follows the route of US&nbsp;99, with the exception of a portion in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of California. The freeway was built in segments between 1956 and 1978, including expressway sections of US&nbsp;99 that were built earlier to bypass various towns along the route.\n\n==Route description==\n{{lengths table|length_ref=<ref name=\"fhwa\" />}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in California|CA]]\n|{{convert|796.53|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in Oregon|OR]]\n|{{convert|308.14|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in Washington|WA]]\n|{{convert|276.62|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|Total\n|{{convert|1381.29|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|}\n\n===California===\n[[File:Interstate5newhallpass.JPG|thumb|right|I-5 in the [[Newhall Pass Interchange]] where it intersects with [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|I-210]] and [[California State Route 14|State Route 14]] near [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] ]]\n{{main|Interstate 5 in California}}\nThe southernmost point of I-5 is at the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican border]] at the [[San Ysidro Port of Entry]], one of the busiest border crossings in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-005.html |title=Busiest border crossing |publisher=Interstate-guide.com |date= |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|failed=y|date=March 2014}}</ref> Beginning at the border in [[San Ysidro, San Deigeo|San Ysidro]] which is part of the city of [[San Diego]], as the [[John J. Montgomery Freeway]], I-5 goes through the suburbs of [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] and [[National City, California|National City]] before reaching downtown San Diego. It then parallels the Pacific coastline, going through the northern suburbs of San Diego, bisecting the [[University of California, San Diego]] campus, and passing the I-805 merge (where it becomes the widest Interstate in the United States for a short stretch), before passing through several [[North County (San Diego area)|North County]] coastal suburbs and then through {{convert|18|mi|km}} of [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] Base [[Camp Pendleton, California|Camp Pendleton]] in northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]]. Here I-5 is also known as the San Diego Freeway.\n\nAt [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]], I-5 turns inland and heads due north through [[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo]] to the [[El Toro Y]] interchange in southeastern [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]. I-5 becomes the [[Santa Ana Freeway]] as it runs southeast to northwest, passing through major cities and suburbs in [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and [[Los Angeles County, California|Southern Los Angeles]] counties. Southern Californians often refer to it as \"the 5\" or as the Santa Ana Freeway in the Los Angeles area. From this point, the San Diego Freeway continues northward as I-405.\n\nWhen the freeway reaches the [[East Los Angeles Interchange]] {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} east of downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], I-5 becomes the [[Golden State Freeway]]. The route continues through the [[San Fernando Valley]] and then crosses the [[Newhall Pass]] through the [[Santa Susana Mountains]] into the [[Santa Clarita Valley]]. The interchange with [[California State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14) is unusual in that truck traffic is separated into its own lanes for both the mainline of the freeway and the transition ramps to and from SR&nbsp;14. For about a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} stretch between the Santa Clarita Valley and [[Pyramid Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Pyramid Lake]], the northbound and southbound lanes separate and cross sides, with the southbound lanes running to the east of the northbound ones. At that point, the Golden State Freeway rises sharply to the north through [[Ridge Route#Features|the Grapevine]] to eventually reach the second-highest point of its entire length, the [[Tejon Pass]] (elevation {{convert|4144|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Through the [[Tehachapi Mountains]]. [[Path 26]] [[electric power transmission|power lines]] generally follow the freeway along this stretch. The freeway then descends sharply for {{convert|12|mi|km}} at Tejon Pass to around {{convert|1500|ft|m}} at Grapevine near the southernmost point of the [[San Joaquin Valley]], approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} south from where [[California State Route 99|SR&nbsp;99]] splits away from it in [[Wheeler Ridge, California|Wheeler Ridge]].\n\n[[File:I-5 near Shasta.jpg|thumb|left|I-5 south approaching Weed and Mount Shasta]]\n\nFrom SR&nbsp;99 to south of [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], I-5 skirts along the far more remote western edge of the great [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], and thus here is removed from population centers such as [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]; other state highways provide these connections. This part of I-5 is known as the West Side Freeway, and is a major connector between the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and Southern California. [[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]] splits from I-5 at a point south of Tracy as the West Side Freeway Scenic Byway, the last stretch of the West Side Freeway\u2014providing a loop-route connection to the San Francisco Bay Area. East of Tracy, I-5 intersects with I-205, another freeway that links I-5 to the Bay Area and passes through Tracy. After passing Tracy, I-5 heads north through [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] before turning west to [[Woodland, California|Woodland]]. At Woodland, the Interstate heads northwest again towards [[Dunnigan, California|Dunnigan]], where it converges with [[Interstate 505|I-505]].\n\nFrom Dunnigan, I-5 skirts north along the western edge of the [[Sacramento Valley]] to [[Red Bluff, California|Red Bluff]]. I-5 then enters the [[Shasta Cascade]] region, passing through [[Redding, California|Redding]] and [[Shasta Lake]] before climbing up to near the foot of [[Mount Shasta]]. The interstate then travels to [[Weed, California|Weed]] and [[Yreka, California|Yreka]] before reaching the Oregon border.\n\n===Oregon===\n{{main|Interstate 5 in Oregon}}\n[[File:I5inPortlandNight.jpg|right|thumb|I-5 running adjacent to the [[Willamette River]] and passes by the [[Moda Center]], and [[Oregon Convention Center]] in Downtown Portland]]\nAbout {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} north of the California border, the highway crosses {{convert|4310|ft|m}} [[Siskiyou Summit]], the highest point on I-5, and then drops down into the [[Rogue Valley]] through Oregon's southern mountains and towns such as [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]] and [[Grants Pass, Oregon|Grants Pass]]. Turning north across three passes to the Umpqua Valley and through [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], the mountains tend to turn into hills, and as it reaches Cottage Grove, the road enters the [[Willamette Valley|Willamette River Valley]]. At [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] the highway intersects [[Oregon Route 126|I-105]], a short spur route into Downtown [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. Some city highways intersect on I-5 in the Eugene Metro. The Interstate then heads almost due north, skirting [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] and [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], passing through [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], and crossing through [[Woodburn, Oregon|Woodburn]]. There were plans to build a spur, called [[Interstate 305 (Oregon)|I-305]], into Salem. I-5 covers {{convert|308|mi|km}} in [[Oregon]].\n\nJust north of Salem, between mile markers 259 and 260 just short of mile marker 260, signs in the median and on both shoulders mark the place where the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] crosses I-5. It reads \"45th Parallel half way between the Equator and the North Pole\".\n\nThe highway then tracks a little to the northeast, and [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]] splits off south of the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] metro area. From here I-5 passes through Tualatin and Tigard along former [[U.S. Route 99W (Oregon)|U.S. Route 99W]] (US&nbsp;99W) before hitting the southern terminus of [[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|I-405]] and the [[Marquam Bridge]]. Also planned was a spur in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] off I-405, called [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|I-505]], but it was never built and has been removed from city plans. A stub of I-505 exists as a long exit ramp to [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]].\n\nAfter crossing the Willamette River on the [[Marquam Bridge]], I-5 has junctions at the western end of [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] and the northern end of I-405. It then continues through the northern parts of the city of Portland, and crosses into Washington via the [[Interstate Bridge]].\n\n===Washington===\n{{main|Interstate 5 in Washington}}\n[[File:SeattleI5Skyline.jpg|thumb|right|I-5 passing through downtown Seattle]]\nThe highway continues over the [[Columbia River]] and drops down into the city of [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]]. About {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} into the state, it reaches the northern terminus of [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]], which is on the eastern edge of the Portland\u2013Vancouver metropolitan area. It then tracks north by northwest through [[Woodland, Washington|Woodland]] to [[Kelso, Washington|Kelso]] and [[Longview, Washington|Longview]], at which point it ceases to parallel a large bend of the Columbia River. Continuing north between the [[Willapa Hills]] and the Cascade foothills, the freeway eventually reaches [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], where it bends sharply east. The highway passes through the northern end of [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord]] (formerly [[Fort Lewis]] and [[McChord Field|McChord Air Force Base]]) and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], where it bends sharply north again to reach [[Seattle]]. The [[Ship Canal Bridge]] carries it over [[Portage Bay]] in Seattle. The freeway continues north out of the Seattle\u2013Tacoma\u2013[[Everett, Washington|Everett]] metro area, crosses the floodplains of three rivers, through the Skagit Valley and the Mount Vernon\u2013Burlington Metropolitan Area to the northern city of [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], to arrive at the [[Peace Arch]] Canada\u2013US border crossing between [[Blaine, Washington]], and [[Surrey, British Columbia]]. [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] continues northwest from the border into [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC]]. I-5 covers {{convert|277|mi|km}} in Washington.\n\n==History==\n{{imageframe|width=100|content=[[File:US&nbsp;99 (1961).svg|100px]]|caption=The shield for US&nbsp;99|align=left}}\n[[File:Dead-Man's Curve in Lebec, California, 2010.jpg|thumb|right|A section of the 1915 Ridge Route in [[Lebec, California]], abandoned when US&nbsp;99 (later upgraded to I-5) was constructed over the [[Tejon Pass]] in order to make the travel straighter and safer.]]\nAn extensive section of this highway (over {{convert|600|mi|km}}), from approximately [[Stockton, California]], to [[Portland, Oregon]], follows very closely the track of the [[Siskiyou Trail]].<ref name=\"siskiyou\">{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsiskiyoutrail.org |title=Museum of the Siskiyou Trail |publisher=Museumsiskiyoutrail.org |accessdate=November 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415171721/http://www.museumsiskiyoutrail.org/ |archivedate=April 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This trail was based on an ancient network of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] footpaths connecting the [[Pacific Northwest]] with California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. By the 1820s, trappers from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] were the first non-Native Americans to use the route of today's I-5 to move between today's Washington State and California. During the second half of the 19th century, mule trains, stagecoaches, and the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] railroad also followed the route of the Siskiyou Trail.<ref name=\"siskiyou\" /> By the early 20th century, pioneering automobile roads were built along the path of the Siskiyou Trail, notably the [[Pacific Highway (United States)|Pacific Highway]]. The Pacific Highway ran from [[British Columbia]] to [[San Diego]], California, and was the immediate predecessor of much of [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]]. The route of US&nbsp;99 was in turn used as a basis for much of the route of today's I-5.\n\nA major deviation from the old US&nbsp;99 route is the Westside Freeway portion of I-5 in California's Central Valley. To provide a faster and more direct north\u2013south route through the state, the decision was made to build a new freeway to the west and bypass [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], and the rest of population centers in the area instead of upgrading the existing highway (which was re-designated as part of [[California State Route 99|SR&nbsp;99]]).<ref name=\"cahighways_5\"/>\nThis re-route through California's Central Valley was the last section of I-5 to be constructed, with the final segment dedicated and opened to traffic near [[Stockton, California]], on October 12, 1979.

He took the name Tippy from the initials for his real name Antonio Pilliteri, or Tony Pilliteri. He got the name Larkin from his older brother Frank who had boxed as Bobby Larkin.<ref name=\"Obituaries pg. 9, 13\">\"Obituaries, Elsewhere\", ''Asbury Park Press'', Asbury, New Jersey, pg. 9, 13 December 1991</ref>\n\nIn 1934, at the age of seventeen, the young Larkin went off to work for a camp of the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) during America's great depression, and soon helped to start inter-camp boxing matches with his co-workers. According to the legend he scored nine straight knockouts in these first amateur bouts.<ref name=\"Fraley, Oscar pg. 37, 16\">Fraley, Oscar, \"Former CCC Worker Started Career With Bluff\", ''Pittsburgh Press'', Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 37, 16 December 1942</ref>\n\nBetween March 1935 and October 1936, he won twenty-nine straight fights, many by knockout. His winning record throughout his early career was remarkable.<ref name =BR/>\n\nBy December 19, 1938, Larkin was rated sixth in the World among American Lightweights, with Henry Armstrong as Champion and Lou Ambers rated first.<ref>\"Bettina Follows Fox Who Trails\", ''The Palm Beach Post'', West Palm Beach, Florida, pg. 6, 19 December 1938</ref>\n\nDemonstrating he was not invincible, on March 8, 1940, Texan Lew Jenkins knocked him out in the first round at Madison Square Garden.  Jenkins was considered a knockout specialist. \"Tearing out with the bell, the slugger from the Southwest (Jenkins) took command immediately. He threw both fists without a stop, finally connecting with a series of solid lefts and rights and Larkin dropped in his corner.\"<ref>Feder, Sid, \"Tippy Larkin Goes to Sleep During First Round\", ''Santa Cruz Sentinel'', Santa Cruz, California, pg. 4, 9 March 1940</ref>\n\nAfter an eight-month lay off to recover from an illness, Larkin stopped Joey Silva on March 13, 1941, in a fourth-round technical knockout in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The bout was stopped at 1:49 into the fourth round by the referee because of a cut near Silva's eye.<ref>\"Tippy Larkin Stops Silva in Return to Boxing\", ''The News Journal'', Wilmington, Delaware, pg. 26, 14 March 1941</ref>\n\nIn the Spring of 1942, Larkin shot himself in the shoulder while cleaning his 22 rifle at home.  He fought only once between February and May of that year, but was not badly injured and resumed his boxing career with considerable success by June.<ref name=Arizona>\"Angott's Retirement Starts Another Meet\", ''Arizona Republic'', Phoenix, Arizona, pg. 13, 1 December 1942</ref>\n\nIn a ramp up to the NYSAC Lightweight Championship, on October 26, 1942, Larkin knocked out Abe Denner in 2:53 of the second round at Laurel Garden in New Jersey. Denner had been down for a count of eight in the second round, before the knockout. Larkin weighed 137 for the bout, actually two pounds over the lightweight limit.<ref>\"Tippy Larkin Chills Denner in Second\", ''The Decatur Daily Review'', Decatur, Illinois, pg. 6, 27 October 1942</ref>\n\n==World Light title attempt==\nOn December 18, 1942, he fought Beau Jack for the New York State Athletic Commission's World Lightweight Title, losing in a third-round knockout at Madison Square Garden. The bout was the first in an elimination tournament for the Lightweight Championship staged by the NYAC, after [[Sammy Angott]] had vacated the title.<ref name=\"Fraley, Oscar pg. 37, 16\"/><ref name=Arizona/>  Larkin was knocked out by a right from Jack near a neutral corner in one minute and nineteen seconds of the third round, but had gone down for a one count in the first round.  The fighting was fierce with many punches connecting, and few pauses from the constant punching by both opponents.  Both boxers weighed between 133-34, in the lightweight range.  A large crowd of 18,817 were on hand to see the bout at the Garden.<ref>Feder, Sid, \"Augusta Golf Club Boy is Champion\", ''The Independent Record'', Helena, Montana, pg. 8, 19 December 1942</ref>\n\n==Loss to Henry Armstrong==\n[[Image:Henry Armstrong.jpg|220 px|left|thumb|Henry Armstrong]]\nOn March 9, 1943, he lost to former triple World Champion [[Henry Armstrong]] in a second-round knockout before a crowd of 8,000 in Civic Auditorium in San Francisco.  Armstrong was attempting a comeback and had formerly held the record for the most consecutive defenses of the World Welterweight Title.  Though Armstrong was a strong draw in his native state, the Light Welterweight division was not. Armstrong knocked out Larkin in one minute and nine seconds of the second round.  Both boxers were weighed in at the light welterweight range of around 140 pounds. Losing to Armstrong was no disgrace, as the great champion [[Barney Ross]] discovered in his career ending bout with Armstrong in May 1938.<ref>\"Henry Armstrong Kayos Tippy Armstrong in Second Round\", ''The Daily InterLake'', Kalispell, Montana, pg. 6, 9 March 1943</ref>\n\n==Important opponents, 1943\u201344==\nOn November 15, 1943, Larkin gained a ten-round points decision over Rhode Island native Al Costa, in Providence, Rhode Island, giving \"an almost perfect exhibition of boxing skill\".  Costa was considered a competent welterweight. Larkin was already boxing at 142 pounds, well into the welterweight range.<ref>\"Tippy Larkin Wins Ten Round Decision\", ''Reno Gazette Journal'', Reno, Nevada, pg. 14, 16 November 1943</ref>\n\nOn December 10, 1943, Larkin knocked out \"Doll\" Rafferty halfway through the second round of a scheduled ten round bout at the Mechanic's Building in Boston.  Larkin's weight was 136, near the top of the lightweight limit.  Rafferty was down twice, once for a count of nine, before the blow which put him on the canvas for the count of ten.<ref>\"Rafferty Knockout Out in Second Round\", ''Ironwood Daily Globe'', Ironwood, Michigan, pg. 8, 11 December 1943</ref>\n\nOn January 14, 1944, Larkin fought a rough ten-round draw against Bobby Ruffin at Madision Square Garden.  A very substantial crowd of 15,323 watched the close bout at the Garden, and the bout gained a greater audience as it was one of the first widely televised boxing matches. Ruffin's manager, Maurie Waxman, was displeased with the Draw ruling.<ref>\"Ruffin, Manager, Turn Silent Sams After Tippy Larkin Draw\", ''The Independent Record'', Helena, Montana, pg. 8, 15 January 1944</ref>\n\n===Win over LuLu Constantino===\nOn February 9, 1944, Larkin easily won a ten-round points decision against LuLu Constantino, considered an important opponent, at Madison Square Garden.  A crowd of 11,535 watched the bout. Tippy boxed at just under 140 pounds, and took a penalty for not being able to make 137.  Using his longer reach, he landed solidly, and rocked Constantino in the fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rounds.<ref>\"New York Begins Ring Innovation\", ''The Evening News'', Hanover, Pennsylvania, pg. 8, 10 February 1944</ref>\n\n===Win over Allie Stoltz===\nOn March 23, 1944, he defeated Allie Stolz, a well rated lightweight, at Madison Square Garden.  Stoltz had the better of the bout in the first two rounds, then overconfident and taunting in the third, he took two hard rights to the chin spaced apart, going down for both before the referee stopped the bout. Larkin was slightly over the lightweight limit at 137 pounds, and into light welterweight territory.  The bout was fought before 15,373 fans at the Garden, a sizable crowd. Larkin would have trouble staying within the lightweight and later junior welterweight limit in his career.<ref>\"Stolz Jeers Tippy Larkin and Wakes Up a Loser\", ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 33, 24 March 1944</ref>\n\nOn June 2, 1944, Larkin achieved an eighth-round technical knockout over Freddie Archer at Madison Square Garden.  He stopped Archer with a very strong straight right arm and the fight eventually ended when the referee stopped the fight one minute and twenty four seconds into the eighth round.  Archer was briefly unconscious on the ropes after the blow, and was hospitalized overnight.<ref>\"Tippy Larkin Stops Archer\", \"Belvidere Daily Republican'', Belvidere, Illinois, pg. 3, 3 June 1944</ref>\n\nLarkin appeared on the cover of ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine in July 1944, gaining recognition as an up-and-coming boxer who was a candidate for the Lightweight championship.<ref name=BR/>\n\n==World Light Welter champ, 1945==\nLarkin first met Joyce on August 3, 1945, in a ten-round unanimous decision at Madison Square Garden.

From 1935 to 1946, Larkin's record was 114-9. He had Angelo Pucci as manager throughout his career, and during the nineteen bouts he had at [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name=BR>\n{{cite web|title=Tippy Larkin|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/9619|publisher=BoxRec|accessdate=8 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828025422/http://boxrec.com/boxer/9619|archive-date=2016-08-28|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>Fought nineteen times at Madison Square Garden in \"Tippy Larkin KO'd Retires Again\", ''Asbury Park Press'', Asbury, New Jersey, pg. 15, 30 December 1952</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nLarkin was born on December 11, 1917 to an Italian family in Garfield, New Jersey.  He took the name Tippy from the initials for his real name Antonio Pilliteri, or Tony Pilliteri. He got the name Larkin from his older brother Frank who had boxed as Bobby Larkin.<ref name=\"Obituaries pg. 9, 13\">\"Obituaries, Elsewhere\", ''Asbury Park Press'', Asbury, New Jersey, pg. 9, 13 December 1991</ref>\n\nIn 1934, at the age of seventeen, the young Larkin went off to work for a camp of the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) during America's great depression, and soon helped to start inter-camp boxing matches with his co-workers. According to the legend he scored nine straight knockouts in these first amateur bouts.<ref name=\"Fraley, Oscar pg. 37, 16\">Fraley, Oscar, \"Former CCC Worker Started Career With Bluff\", ''Pittsburgh Press'', Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 37, 16 December 1942</ref>\n\nBetween March 1935 and October 1936, he won twenty-nine straight fights, many by knockout. His winning record throughout his early career was remarkable.<ref name =BR/>\n\nBy December 19, 1938, Larkin was rated sixth in the World among American Lightweights, with Henry Armstrong as Champion and Lou Ambers rated first.<ref>\"Bettina Follows Fox Who Trails\", ''The Palm Beach Post'', West Palm Beach, Florida, pg. 6, 19 December 1938</ref>\n\nDemonstrating he was not invincible, on March 8, 1940, Texan Lew Jenkins knocked him out in the first round at Madison Square Garden.  Jenkins was considered a knockout specialist. \"Tearing out with the bell, the slugger from the Southwest (Jenkins) took command immediately. He threw both fists without a stop, finally connecting with a series of solid lefts and rights and Larkin dropped in his corner.\"<ref>Feder, Sid, \"Tippy Larkin Goes to Sleep During First Round\", ''Santa Cruz Sentinel'', Santa Cruz, California, pg. 4, 9 March 1940</ref>\n\nAfter an eight-month lay off to recover from an illness, Larkin stopped Joey Silva on March 13, 1941, in a fourth-round technical knockout in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The bout was stopped at 1:49 into the fourth round by the referee because of a cut near Silva's eye.<ref>\"Tippy Larkin Stops Silva in Return to Boxing\", ''The News Journal'', Wilmington, Delaware, pg. 26, 14 March 1941</ref>\n\nIn the Spring of 1942, Larkin shot himself in the shoulder while cleaning his 22 rifle at home.  He fought only once between February and May of that year, but was not badly injured and resumed his boxing career with considerable success by June.<ref name=Arizona>\"Angott's Retirement Starts Another Meet\", ''Arizona Republic'', Phoenix, Arizona, pg. 13, 1 December 1942</ref>\n\nIn a ramp up to the NYSAC Lightweight Championship, on October 26, 1942, Larkin knocked out Abe Denner in 2:53 of the second round at Laurel Garden in New Jersey. Denner had been down for a count of eight in the second round, before the knockout. Larkin weighed 137 for the bout, actually two pounds over the lightweight limit.<ref>\"Tippy Larkin Chills Denner in Second\", ''The Decatur Daily Review'', Decatur, Illinois, pg. 6, 27 October 1942</ref>\n\n==World Light title attempt==\nOn December 18, 1942, he fought Beau Jack for the New York State Athletic Commission's World Lightweight Title, losing in a third-round knockout at Madison Square Garden. The bout was the first in an elimination tournament for the Lightweight Championship staged by the NYAC, after [[Sammy Angott]] had vacated the title.<ref name=\"Fraley, Oscar pg. 37, 16\"/><ref name=Arizona/>  Larkin was knocked out by a right from Jack near a neutral corner in one minute and nineteen seconds of the third round, but had gone down for a one count in the first round.  The fighting was fierce with many punches connecting, and few pauses from the constant punching by both opponents.  Both boxers weighed between 133-34, in the lightweight range.  A large crowd of 18,817 were on hand to see the bout at the Garden.<ref>Feder, Sid, \"Augusta Golf Club Boy is Champion\", ''The Independent Record'', Helena, Montana, pg. 8, 19 December 1942</ref>\n\n==Loss to Henry Armstrong==\n[[Image:Henry Armstrong.jpg|220 px|left|thumb|Henry Armstrong]]\nOn March 9, 1943, he lost to former triple World Champion [[Henry Armstrong]] in a second-round knockout before a crowd of 8,000 in Civic Auditorium in San Francisco.  Armstrong was attempting a comeback and had formerly held the record for the most consecutive defenses of the World Welterweight Title.  Though Armstrong was a strong draw in his native state, the Light Welterweight division was not. Armstrong knocked out Larkin in one minute and nine seconds of the second round.  Both boxers were weighed in at the light welterweight range of around 140 pounds. Losing to Armstrong was no disgrace, as the great champion [[Barney Ross]] discovered in his career ending bout with Armstrong in May 1938.<ref>\"Henry Armstrong Kayos Tippy Armstrong in Second Round\", ''The Daily InterLake'', Kalispell, Montana, pg. 6, 9 March 1943</ref>\n\n==Important opponents, 1943\u201344==\nOn November 15, 1943, Larkin gained a ten-round points decision over Rhode Island native Al Costa, in Providence, Rhode Island, giving \"an almost perfect exhibition of boxing skill\".  Costa was considered a competent welterweight. Larkin was already boxing at 142 pounds, well into the welterweight range.<ref>\"Tippy Larkin Wins Ten Round Decision\", ''Reno Gazette Journal'', Reno, Nevada, pg. 14, 16 November 1943</ref>\n\nOn December 10, 1943, Larkin knocked out \"Doll\" Rafferty halfway through the second round of a scheduled ten round bout at the Mechanic's Building in Boston.  Larkin's weight was 136, near the top of the lightweight limit.  Rafferty was down twice, once for a count of nine, before the blow which put him on the canvas for the count of ten.<ref>\"Rafferty Knockout Out in Second Round\", ''Ironwood Daily Globe'', Ironwood, Michigan, pg. 8, 11 December 1943</ref>\n\nOn January 14, 1944, Larkin fought a rough ten-round draw against Bobby Ruffin at Madision Square Garden.  A very substantial crowd of 15,323 watched the close bout at the Garden, and the bout gained a greater audience as it was one of the first widely televised boxing matches. Ruffin's manager, Maurie Waxman, was displeased with the Draw ruling.<ref>\"Ruffin, Manager, Turn Silent Sams After Tippy Larkin Draw\", ''The Independent Record'', Helena, Montana, pg. 8, 15 January 1944</ref>\n\n===Win over LuLu Constantino===\nOn February 9, 1944, Larkin easily won a ten-round points decision against LuLu Constantino, considered an important opponent, at Madison Square Garden.  A crowd of 11,535 watched the bout. Tippy boxed at just under 140 pounds, and took a penalty for not being able to make 137.  Using his longer reach, he landed solidly, and rocked Constantino in the fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rounds.<ref>\"New York Begins Ring Innovation\", ''The Evening News'', Hanover, Pennsylvania, pg. 8, 10 February 1944</ref>\n\n===Win over Allie Stoltz===\nOn March 23, 1944, he defeated Allie Stolz, a well rated lightweight, at Madison Square Garden.  Stoltz had the better of the bout in the first two rounds, then overconfident and taunting in the third, he took two hard rights to the chin spaced apart, going down for both before the referee stopped the bout. Larkin was slightly over the lightweight limit at 137 pounds, and into light welterweight territory.  The bout was fought before 15,373 fans at the Garden, a sizable crowd. Larkin would have trouble staying within the lightweight and later junior welterweight limit in his career.<ref>\"Stolz Jeers Tippy Larkin and Wakes Up a Loser\", ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 33, 24 March 1944</ref>\n\nOn June 2, 1944, Larkin achieved an eighth-round technical knockout over Freddie Archer at Madison Square Garden.  He stopped Archer with a very strong straight right arm and the fight eventually ended when the referee stopped the fight one minute and twenty four seconds into the eighth round.  Archer was briefly unconscious on the ropes after the blow, and was hospitalized overnight.<ref>\"Tippy Larkin Stops Archer\", \"Belvidere Daily Republican'', Belvidere, Illinois, pg. 3, 3 June 1944</ref>\n\nLarkin appeared on the cover of ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine in July 1944, gaining recognition as an up-and-coming boxer who was a candidate for the Lightweight championship.<ref name=BR/>\n\n==World Light Welter champ, 1945==\nLarkin first met Joyce on August 3, 1945, in a ten-round unanimous decision at Madison Square Garden.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Carper served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1983 to 1993 and was the [[List of governors of Delaware|71st governor of Delaware]] from 1993 to 2001.\n\nA native of [[Beckley, West Virginia]], Carper graduated from [[Ohio State University]]. Serving as a [[Naval Flight Officer]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] from 1968 until 1973, he flew the [[P-3 Orion]] as a Tactical Coordinator/Mission Commander<ref>\"Navy Submarine to Bear Delaware's Name,\" Wilmington (Delaware) News Journal, 19 Nov 2012</ref> and saw active duty in the [[Vietnam War]]. After leaving the active duty Navy, he remained in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] for another 18 years and eventually retired with the rank of [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] (O-6). Upon receiving his [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[University of Delaware]] in 1975, Carper went to work for the State of Delaware in its economic development office. He was elected State Treasurer, serving from 1977 to 1983 and leading the development of Delaware's first cash management system.\n\nEncouraged by local politicians, Carper successfully ran for Delaware's only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982. He served five terms in the House, where he chaired the Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization. In 1992 he arranged a swap with term-limited Governor [[Mike Castle]], and the two were easily elected to each other's seats. Carper governed for two terms as a moderate, business-oriented [[New Democrat]], following the lead of the two previous Republican governors.\n\nCarper was elected to the U.S. Senate in [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2000|2000]], defeating Republican incumbent [[William V. Roth, Jr.]]. He was reelected by landslides in [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2006|2006]], [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2012|2012]] and [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2018|2018]]. He serves as one of four Deputy Democratic Whips, the ranking member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]] and on the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]]. Carper is the senior senator in [[United States congressional delegations from Delaware|Delaware's congressional delegation]].\n\n==Early years and personal life==\nCarper was born in [[Beckley, West Virginia|Beckley]], West Virginia, the son of Mary Jean (n\u00e9e Patton) and Wallace Richard Carper. He grew up in [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]], Virginia, and graduated from [[Whetstone High School (Columbus, Ohio)|Whetstone High School]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]]. He then graduated from the [[Ohio State University]] in 1968, where he was a midshipman in the [[Naval ROTC]] and earned a degree in economics. At Ohio State, Carper became a member of the Beta Phi Chapter of the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity.\n\nServing as a [[Naval Flight Officer]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] from 1968 until 1973, he served three tours of duty in [[Southeast Asia]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. He remained in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] as a [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 aircraft]] mission commander for another 18 years and retired with the rank of [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain (O-6)]].<ref>https://carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/biography-and-pictures</ref> Meanwhile, he moved to Delaware and earned a [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[University of Delaware]] in 1975, after which time he went to work for the economic development office for the State of [[Delaware]].\n\nCarper married Martha Ann Stacy in 1985, and with her he had two children, Christopher and Benjamin. The family are members of Westminster Presbyterian Church in [[Wilmington, Delaware]].\n\n==Professional and early political career==\nWhile in college at the Ohio State University, Carper worked on the presidential campaign of U.S. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]], the Minnesota peace candidate. In Delaware he worked as the campaign treasurer for University of Delaware professor James R. Soles in his unsuccessful 1974 bid for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].\n\nAfter receiving his MBA degree in 1975, Carper went to work for the State of Delaware's economic development office. In 1976, after developing good relationships with members of the state party leadership, he took out a $5,000 personal loan to fund his campaign for the Treasurer of Delaware. After convincing the party leaders, and later the voters, that he was the right person to be [[State treasurer|Delaware State Treasurer]], he defeated the favored Republican Party candidate, Theodore Jones. He served three terms, from January 18, 1977 through January 3, 1983, during which time he oversaw the development of Delaware's first cash management system.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n[[File:Tom Carper 102nd Congressional portrait.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Carper during his time in the House of Representatives]]\nIt took a considerable amount of persuasion on the part of U.S. Senator [[Joe Biden]] and others to convince Carper to leave his obscure, but safe, position as Treasurer and compete for Delaware's only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982. [[Thomas B. Evans, Jr.]], the incumbent Republican, was running again, and although he had been caught in a compromising \"association\" on a golfing trip with the young lobbyist Paula Parkinson, he was still a formidable and well-connected politician.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Baker|first=Donald P.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/03/07/congressmen-shared-house-with-female-lobbyist/b7e72e4f-410b-4187-a8be-91fec3aeca42/|title=Congressmen Shared House With Female Lobbyist|date=1981-03-07|work=Washington Post|access-date=2020-03-06|last2=story|first2=Washington Post Staff Writer; Washington Post Staff Writer Eugene L. Meyer also contributed to this|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\nThe campaign was going well for Carper until three weeks before Election Day, when the ''[[New York Post]]'' published an article claiming that the \"dirtiest campaign in the country is being waged in tiny Delaware.\" Retelling the well-known story of Evans' golfing trip, it went on to accuse Carper of abusing his wife and stepchildren. But the story actually ended up working to Carper's political advantage when suspicions spread that the allegations had been planted by an Evans supporter and when public opinion seemed to conclude that the allegations were inappropriately exploiting a private issue.<ref name=OnlyinDelaware>{{cite book |title=Only in Delaware, Politics and Politicians in the First State |date=2002|last=Cohen |first=Celia |pages=293\u2013295}}</ref><ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/365035-dem-senator-denies-report-claiming-he-lied-about-abusing-his \"Dem senator denies report claiming he lied about abusing his wife\" By John Bowden of The Hill]</ref>\n\nCarper went on to serve five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. He won his second term in 1984, by defeating Elise R.W. du Pont, the wife of former Governor [[Pete du Pont|Pierre S. du Pont, IV]]. He then enjoyed easy victories over Republicans Thomas S. Neuberger in 1986, James P. Krapf in 1988 and Ralph O. Williams in 1990. A U.S. Representative, he was a member of the [[U.S. House Committee on Financial Services|U.S. House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs]] and the [[U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|U.S House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries]]. He chaired the House Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization. In these positions he worked to allow banks into the securities business and to discourage the dumping of sludge into the ocean.\n\nDuring his years in the U.S. House of Representatives Carper sought to gain better control of the Democratic Party organization in Delaware in hopes of someday becoming governor. Heavily Democratic and with over half of the population of the state, [[New Castle County]] was the key. Its Democratic organization was controlled by Eugene T. Reed, a former ironworker, and an old-time political party boss who was then among several politicians in both parties implicated in illegal money raising practices. To address this corruption and rescue the reputation of the Democratic Party, Carper recruited Joseph E. Reardon, a [[DuPont Company]] chemist, as a candidate for New Castle County Democratic Party chairman. By early 1989, he had succeeded in getting Reardon elected, and Reardon replaced Reed at the head of a newly reformed party organization. In 1990 Carper faced a primary challenge from a Reed ally, Daniel D. Rappa, after winning, he went on to win election to his fifth term as U.S. Representative.\n\n==Governor of Delaware==\nIn the small and intimate political community of Delaware, important decisions are often made by a consensus of leaders from both parties. So it was in 1992, when popular incumbent (Republican) Governor [[Mike Castle|Michael Castle]] was forced to retire owing to [[term limits]]. The result was what became known as \"the Swap.\" Castle ran for Carper's seat in the U.S. House of Representatives and Carper ran for Governor. Neither faced any significant opposition and Delaware retained the services of two very popular office holders representing both major parties.\n\nThus, in 1992, Carper was elected Governor of Delaware, defeating the Republican candidate, B. Gary Scott. He ended up serving two terms. As a moderate, business-oriented Democrat who followed two very competent and popular Republican administrations, those of [[Pete du Pont|Pierre S. du Pont, IV]] and Castle, Carper chose to govern in much the same way they had over their combined 16 years in office, adding to the mix his special interest in and talent for economic development and business recruitment. Two particular successes were his prevention of the closure of the [[General Motors]] automobile operation near [[Newport, Delaware]] and the state's victory in the competition with Pennsylvania for the location of the headquarters of the pharmaceutical giant, [[AstraZeneca]].\n\nContinuing du Pont's tax cutting policies, Carper led an ongoing effort to reduce [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] rates, eliminate the [[marriage penalty]] and [[estate tax]], cut the public [[utility tax]], and eliminate the [[gross receipts tax]] for many small businesses. By doing so, his administration improved the state's credit rating from among the worst in the nation to an excellent \"AAA\". He also retained Castle's standards-based education programs, raising standards, testing students, and pushing through a teacher accountability bill. Other programs included a fully funded [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] program and the creation of a prescription-drug benefit for seniors.\n\nCarper's independent, [[New Democrat]] approach made him popular among voters, but caused grumbling among old line Democrats, particularly union leaders, who complained that not enough of them were being awarded patronage jobs after the many years of Republican control.<ref name=OnlyinDelaware/> In an era of increasingly bitter, partisan politics, Carper's actions and policies placed him at the political center, in keeping with Delaware's consensus style of governing. One atypical example of Carper's bipartisan cooperation occurred in 1995, when Carper's former House colleague [[Bob Dornan]] was running as a candidate in the [[1996 Republican Party presidential primaries|1996 Republican primary for the Presidential nomination]]. At a stop in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] for a train on which Dornan was traveling, Carper was waiting on the platform, dressed as a pregnant woman, carrying a sign that said \"Dornan Is the One\". Dornan recognized Carper, and went along with the joke, which Carper had coordinated with the [[Republican State Committee of Delaware]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Martinez |first1=Gebe |title=Dornan's Presidential Bid Off to Bizarre Start : Politics: Governor of Delaware greets him dressed as pregnant woman. Long-shot campaign relies on family. |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-17/news/mn-55699_1_bob-dornan |accessdate=February 22, 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 17, 1995}}</ref>\n\nThe most poignant event during this period was the murder of Carper's personal scheduler, Anne Marie Fahey, and the eventual conviction of [[Thomas J. Capano]] for the crime. Capano was a wealthy, well-connected lawyer, known to nearly everyone in Delaware's political community. Fahey, a 30-year-old member of another well-known family, was attempting to end a romantic relationship with the married Capano, when he murdered her and dumped her body in the Atlantic Ocean. [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[Colm F. Connolly]] built the case against Capano, who was tried and convicted, then sentenced by [[Delaware Superior Court]] Judge [[William Swain Lee]].\n\nAs a tribute to Fahey, who had been a youth [[mentorship|mentor]], then-Governor Carper also became a mentor, and began actively promoting mentoring programs throughout Delaware's business community. As a result, by the end of his last term, Delaware held the highest per-capita ratio of youth mentors in the country. Carper also established the Delaware Mentoring Council to help sustain this important legacy.\n\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:94%; margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Delaware General Assembly<br /> ''(sessions while Governor)''\n|-\n!'''Year'''\n!'''Assembly'''\n!\n!'''Senate Majority'''\n!'''President<br />''pro tempore'''''\n!\n!'''House Majority'''\n!'''Speaker'''\n|-\n|1993\u20131994\n|[[Delaware General Assembly|137th]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |Richard S.

For 16 years, the same four people had held the four major statewide positions&nbsp;\u2014 Governor Carper and fellow Democratic Senator [[Joe Biden]], and Republicans U.S. Representative [[Mike Castle|Michael Castle]] and Senator [[William Roth|William V. Roth, Jr]]. Because of gubernatorial term limits, Carper had to retire from the post. He wanted to run for the Senate against the incumbent Roth. Roth would not retire voluntarily and fellow Republican Castle would not force him into a primary. Carper declared his candidacy in September 1999.<ref>{{cite news| title=Delaware governor to challenge Roth |url=http://articles.cnn.com/1999-09-21/politics/senate.2000_delaware.senate_1_delaware-governor-sixth-senate-term-delaware-residents?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003081751/http://articles.cnn.com/1999-09-21/politics/senate.2000_delaware.senate_1_delaware-governor-sixth-senate-term-delaware-residents?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS |date=21 September 2012 |archive-date=3 October 2012 |publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref> In a contest between two popular and respected politicians, the issue seemed to be Roth's age: Roth was 79, versus Carper's relative youth.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Carper served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1983 to 1993 and was the [[List of governors of Delaware|71st governor of Delaware]] from 1993 to 2001.\n\nA native of [[Beckley, West Virginia]], Carper graduated from [[Ohio State University]]. Serving as a [[Naval Flight Officer]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] from 1968 until 1973, he flew the [[P-3 Orion]] as a Tactical Coordinator/Mission Commander<ref>\"Navy Submarine to Bear Delaware's Name,\" Wilmington (Delaware) News Journal, 19 Nov 2012</ref> and saw active duty in the [[Vietnam War]]. After leaving the active duty Navy, he remained in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] for another 18 years and eventually retired with the rank of [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] (O-6). Upon receiving his [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[University of Delaware]] in 1975, Carper went to work for the State of Delaware in its economic development office. He was elected State Treasurer, serving from 1977 to 1983 and leading the development of Delaware's first cash management system.\n\nEncouraged by local politicians, Carper successfully ran for Delaware's only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982. He served five terms in the House, where he chaired the Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization. In 1992 he arranged a swap with term-limited Governor [[Mike Castle]], and the two were easily elected to each other's seats. Carper governed for two terms as a moderate, business-oriented [[New Democrat]], following the lead of the two previous Republican governors.\n\nCarper was elected to the U.S. Senate in [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2000|2000]], defeating Republican incumbent [[William V. Roth, Jr.]]. He was reelected by landslides in [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2006|2006]], [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2012|2012]] and [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2018|2018]]. He serves as one of four Deputy Democratic Whips, the ranking member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]] and on the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committe]]. Carper is the senior senator in [[United States congressional delegations from Delaware|Delaware's congressional delegation]].\n\n==Early years and personal life==\nCarper was born in [[Beckley, West Virginia|Beckley]], West Virginia, the son of Mary Jean (n\u00e9e Patton) and Wallace Richard Carper. He grew up in [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]], Virginia, and graduated from [[Whetstone High School (Columbus, Ohio)|Whetstone High School]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]]. He then graduated from the [[Ohio State University]] in 1968, where he was a midshipman in the [[Naval ROTC]] and earned a degree in economics. At Ohio State, Carper became a member of the Beta Phi Chapter of the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity.\n\nServing as a [[Naval Flight Officer]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] from 1968 until 1973, he served three tours of duty in [[Southeast Asia]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. He remained in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] as a [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 aircraft]] mission commander for another 18 years and retired with the rank of [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain (O-6)]].<ref>https://carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/biography-and-pictures</ref> Meanwhile, he moved to Delaware and earned a [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[University of Delaware]] in 1975, after which time he went to work for the economic development office for the State of [[Delaware]].\n\nCarper married Martha Ann Stacy in 1985, and with her he had two children, Christopher and Benjamin. The family are members of Westminster Presbyterian Church in [[Wilmington, Delaware]].\n\n==Professional and early political career==\nWhile in college at the Ohio State University, Carper worked on the presidential campaign of U.S. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]], the Minnesota peace candidate. In Delaware he worked as the campaign treasurer for University of Delaware professor James R. Soles in his unsuccessful 1974 bid for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].\n\nAfter receiving his MBA degree in 1975, Carper went to work for the State of Delaware's economic development office. In 1976, after developing good relationships with members of the state party leadership, he took out a $5,000 personal loan to fund his campaign for the Treasurer of Delaware. After convincing the party leaders, and later the voters, that he was the right person to be [[State treasurer|Delaware State Treasurer]], he defeated the favored Republican Party candidate, Theodore Jones. He served three terms, from January 18, 1977 through January 3, 1983, during which time he oversaw the development of Delaware's first cash management system.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n[[File:Tom Carper 102nd Congressional portrait.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Carper during his time in the House of Representatives]]\nIt took a considerable amount of persuasion on the part of U.S. Senator [[Joe Biden]] and others to convince Carper to leave his obscure, but safe, position as Treasurer and compete for Delaware's only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982. [[Thomas B. Evans, Jr.]], the incumbent Republican, was running again, and although he had been caught in a compromising \"association\" on a golfing trip with the young lobbyist Paula Parkinson, he was still a formidable and well-connected politician.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Baker|first=Donald P.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/03/07/congressmen-shared-house-with-female-lobbyist/b7e72e4f-410b-4187-a8be-91fec3aeca42/|title=Congressmen Shared House With Female Lobbyist|date=1981-03-07|work=Washington Post|access-date=2020-03-06|last2=story|first2=Washington Post Staff Writer; Washington Post Staff Writer Eugene L. Meyer also contributed to this|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\nThe campaign was going well for Carper until three weeks before Election Day, when the ''[[New York Post]]'' published an article claiming that the \"dirtiest campaign in the country is being waged in tiny Delaware.\" Retelling the well-known story of Evans' golfing trip, it went on to accuse Carper of abusing his wife and stepchildren. But the story actually ended up working to Carper's political advantage when suspicions spread that the allegations had been planted by an Evans supporter and when public opinion seemed to conclude that the allegations were inappropriately exploiting a private issue.<ref name=OnlyinDelaware>{{cite book |title=Only in Delaware, Politics and Politicians in the First State |date=2002|last=Cohen |first=Celia |pages=293\u2013295}}</ref><ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/365035-dem-senator-denies-report-claiming-he-lied-about-abusing-his \"Dem senator denies report claiming he lied about abusing his wife\" By John Bowden of The Hill]</ref>\n\nCarper went on to serve five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. He won his second term in 1984, by defeating Elise R.W. du Pont, the wife of former Governor [[Pete du Pont|Pierre S. du Pont, IV]]. He then enjoyed easy victories over Republicans Thomas S. Neuberger in 1986, James P. Krapf in 1988 and Ralph O. Williams in 1990. A U.S. Representative, he was a member of the [[U.S. House Committee on Financial Services|U.S. House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs]] and the [[U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|U.S House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries]]. He chaired the House Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization. In these positions he worked to allow banks into the securities business and to discourage the dumping of sludge into the ocean.\n\nDuring his years in the U.S. House of Representatives Carper sought to gain better control of the Democratic Party organization in Delaware in hopes of someday becoming governor. Heavily Democratic and with over half of the population of the state, [[New Castle County]] was the key. Its Democratic organization was controlled by Eugene T. Reed, a former ironworker, and an old-time political party boss who was then among several politicians in both parties implicated in illegal money raising practices. To address this corruption and rescue the reputation of the Democratic Party, Carper recruited Joseph E. Reardon, a [[DuPont Company]] chemist, as a candidate for New Castle County Democratic Party chairman. By early 1989, he had succeeded in getting Reardon elected, and Reardon replaced Reed at the head of a newly reformed party organization. In 1990 Carper faced a primary challenge from a Reed ally, Daniel D. Rappa, after winning, he went on to win election to his fifth term as U.S. Representative.\n\n==Governor of Delaware==\nIn the small and intimate political community of Delaware, important decisions are often made by a consensus of leaders from both parties. So it was in 1992, when popular incumbent (Republican) Governor [[Mike Castle|Michael Castle]] was forced to retire owing to [[term limits]]. The result was what became known as \"the Swap.\" Castle ran for Carper's seat in the U.S. House of Representatives and Carper ran for Governor. Neither faced any significant opposition and Delaware retained the services of two very popular office holders representing both major parties.\n\nThus, in 1992, Carper was elected Governor of Delaware, defeating the Republican candidate, B. Gary Scott. He ended up serving two terms. As a moderate, business-oriented Democrat who followed two very competent and popular Republican administrations, those of [[Pete du Pont|Pierre S. du Pont, IV]] and Castle, Carper chose to govern in much the same way they had over their combined 16 years in office, adding to the mix his special interest in and talent for economic development and business recruitment. Two particular successes were his prevention of the closure of the [[General Motors]] automobile operation near [[Newport, Delaware]] and the state's victory in the competition with Pennsylvania for the location of the headquarters of the pharmaceutical giant, [[AstraZeneca]].\n\nContinuing du Pont's tax cutting policies, Carper led an ongoing effort to reduce [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] rates, eliminate the [[marriage penalty]] and [[estate tax]], cut the public [[utility tax]], and eliminate the [[gross receipts tax]] for many small businesses. By doing so, his administration improved the state's credit rating from among the worst in the nation to an excellent \"AAA\". He also retained Castle's standards-based education programs, raising standards, testing students, and pushing through a teacher accountability bill. Other programs included a fully funded [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] program and the creation of a prescription-drug benefit for seniors.\n\nCarper's independent, [[New Democrat]] approach made him popular among voters, but caused grumbling among old line Democrats, particularly union leaders, who complained that not enough of them were being awarded patronage jobs after the many years of Republican control.<ref name=OnlyinDelaware/> In an era of increasingly bitter, partisan politics, Carper's actions and policies placed him at the political center, in keeping with Delaware's consensus style of governing. One atypical example of Carper's bipartisan cooperation occurred in 1995, when Carper's former House colleague [[Bob Dornan]] was running as a candidate in the [[1996 Republican Party presidential primaries|1996 Republican primary for the Presidential nomination]]. At a stop in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] for a train on which Dornan was traveling, Carper was waiting on the platform, dressed as a pregnant woman, carrying a sign that said \"Dornan Is the One\". Dornan recognized Carper, and went along with the joke, which Carper had coordinated with the [[Republican State Committee of Delaware]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Martinez |first1=Gebe |title=Dornan's Presidential Bid Off to Bizarre Start : Politics: Governor of Delaware greets him dressed as pregnant woman. Long-shot campaign relies on family. |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-17/news/mn-55699_1_bob-dornan |accessdate=February 22, 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 17, 1995}}</ref>\n\nThe most poignant event during this period was the murder of Carper's personal scheduler, Anne Marie Fahey, and the eventual conviction of [[Thomas J. Capano]] for the crime. Capano was a wealthy, well-connected lawyer, known to nearly everyone in Delaware's political community. Fahey, a 30-year-old member of another well-known family, was attempting to end a romantic relationship with the married Capano, when he murdered her and dumped her body in the Atlantic Ocean. [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[Colm F. Connolly]] built the case against Capano, who was tried and convicted, then sentenced by [[Delaware Superior Court]] Judge [[William Swain Lee]].\n\nAs a tribute to Fahey, who had been a youth [[mentorship|mentor]], then-Governor Carper also became a mentor, and began actively promoting mentoring programs throughout Delaware's business community. As a result, by the end of his last term, Delaware held the highest per-capita ratio of youth mentors in the country. Carper also established the Delaware Mentoring Council to help sustain this important legacy.\n\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:94%; margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Delaware General Assembly<br /> ''(sessions while Governor)''\n|-\n!'''Year'''\n!'''Assembly'''\n!\n!'''Senate Majority'''\n!'''President<br />''pro tempore'''''\n!\n!'''House Majority'''\n!'''Speaker'''\n|-\n|1993\u20131994\n|[[Delaware General Assembly|137th]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |Richard S.

Roth would not retire voluntarily and fellow Republican Castle would not force him into a primary.

He also joined the youth team at [[Basingstoke R.F.C.|Basingstoke RFC]] the following year. Under the guidance of Andy Bloodworth (of Chineham RFC) and Dave Luff, Rees progressed in the sport, initially playing in the [[Rugby union positions#13. Outside centre .26 12.

Rees was eventually selected for England U16s, where he was awarded player of the year, and which led to his receiving offers from many Rugby-playing grammar schools: he chose to attend [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe|The Royal Grammar School]] in High Wycombe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrum.com/premiership/rugby/player/15445.html|title=Tom Rees|accessdate=1 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rees: I want to follow in old boys' footsteps|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/sport/576106.0/|publisher=[[Bucks Free Press]]|date=4 March 2005}}</ref> Rees went on to play for England U18s and then U19s, being the first-choice openside flanker in both sides.

Early Tour riders consumed [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and used [[diethyl ether|ether]], among other substances, as a means of dulling the pain of competing in endurance cycling.<ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/187085/202-7384003-1751816As{{dead link|date=April 2020}} ''History, Drugs and the Tour de France'' by [[Tim Moore (writer)|Tim Moore]]</ref> Riders began using substances as a means of increasing performance rather than dulling the senses, and organizing bodies such as the ''Tour'' and the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|International Cycling Union]] (UCI), as well as government bodies, enacted policies to combat the practice.\n\n[[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|Use of performance-enhancing drugs]] in cycling predates the Tour de France. Cycling, having been from the start a sport of extremes, whether of speed by being paced by tandems, motorcycles and even cars, or of distance, the suffering involved encouraged the means to alleviate it. Not until after World War II were sporting or even particularly health issues raised. Those came shortly before the [[death of Tom Simpson]] in the Tour de France of 1967. Max Novich referred to the Tour de France in a 1973 issue of ''New York State Journal of Medicine'' as \"a cycling nightmare\".<ref>Novich, Max M: Drug abuse and drugs in sports, ''New York State Journal of Medicine'', vol 73, no 21, 1 November 1973</ref> Journalist Hans Halter wrote in 1998 that \"For as long as the Tour has existed, since 1903, its participants have been doping themselves. For 60 years doping was allowed. For the past 30 years it has been officially prohibited. Yet the fact remains; great cyclists have been doping themselves, then and now.\"<ref>Halter, Hans: 'Alles verstehen, alles verzeihen', ''Der Spiegel'', Germany 3 August 1998</ref>\n\n== Early doping in cycling ==\n{{See also|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport}}\n[[File:Paris2.jpg|thumb|right|Major Taylor racing in Paris 1908]]\nDrug-taking in cycling predates the Tour de France. \"It existed, it has always existed\", said the French reporter and author, [[Pierre Chany]], who followed 49 Tours before his death in 1996.<ref>Penot, Christophe: ''Pierre Chany, l'homme aux 50 Tours de France'', \u00c9ditions Cristel, France, 1996</ref> The exhaustion of [[six-day racing|six-day races]] on the track was countered by the riders' soigneurs (the French word for \"carer\"), helpers akin to seconds in [[boxing]]. Among the treatments they supplied was [[nitroglycerine]], a drug used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and which was credited with improving riders' breathing.<ref>Novich, Max M., ''Abbotempo'', UK, 1964</ref> Riders suffered hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs. The American champion [[Major Taylor]] refused to continue the New York race, saying: \"I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand.\"<ref>Bearings, US, 24 December 1896, cited Ritchie, Andrew, ''Major Taylor'', Bicycle Books, US, 1988</ref>\n\nAlso used was [[strychnine]], which in small doses tightened tired muscles. A track rider of the era said he had developed such a tolerance to the drug that he took doses large enough to kill smaller men.<ref name=dope>Woodland, Les (1980) ''Dope, the use of drugs in sport'', David and Charles, UK</ref> The use of strychnine, far from being banned, was thought necessary to survive demanding races, says the sports historian Alain Lunzenfichter.<ref>Lunzenfichter, Alain: ''C'est pas du Jeu!'', ''L'\u00c9quipe'', France, 10 December 2007</ref>\n\nThe American specialist in doping, Max M. Novich, wrote: \"Trainers of the old school who supplied treatments which had cocaine as their base declared with assurance that a rider tired by a six-day race would get his second breath after absorbing these mixtures.\"<ref>Novich, ibid. Cited De Mondenard, Dr Jean-Pierre: ''Dopage, l'imposture des performances,  Chiron, France, 2000</ref> [[John Hoberman]], a professor at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas, said six-day races were \"de facto experiments investigating the physiology of stress as well as the substances that might alleviate exhaustion.\"<ref>Hoberman, John; \"[https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19462071/ Dopers on Wheels: The Tour's sorry history]\". Retrieved December 2007</ref>\n\nThe first backers of races on the road were newspapers. Although ''Le V\u00e9locip\u00e8de Illustr\u00e9'', which was behind the world's first long-distance road race in November 1869, said its purpose was \"to further the good cause of the bicycle\" because \"it must be determined that the bicycle can be raced over considerable distances with incomparably less fatigue than running\",<ref>''Le V\u00e9locip\u00e8de Illustr\u00e9'', Paris, 1 April 1869</ref> backing the race would also boost the newspaper's sales. In an era before radio and television, newspapers could build the drama of a race for weeks, rely on customers buying a further copy on the day to prepare for the riders to pass and then another next day to see what had become of them. Few people had travelled 130&nbsp;km, at least not often, and the idea of doing it by bicycle and at as high a speed as possible when the roads were potholed and bicycles had wooden wheels and metal tyres was exciting. The result was that newspapers outdid each other in promotions. In 1891 came a race from [[Bordeaux]] to Paris. In the same year, ''Le Petit Journal'' went twice as far by running [[Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris]] over 1,200&nbsp;km.\n\nDuring a meeting at ''L'Auto'' in Paris, journalist [[G\u00e9o Lef\u00e8vre]] suggested a race right round France, not just one day but six, \"like the six-day races on the track.\"<ref name=Chany>Chany, Pierre: ''La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France'', \u00c9ditions La Martini\u00e8re, France, 1988</ref> The idea of bringing the excess of the indoors to the roads of the outdoors was born. And with it came the practices which had seen riders through their suffering.\n\n== 1903-1940s: Doping as acceptable means ==\nThe strongest drug in the early Tour de France was strychnine. Other than that, riders would take anything to survive the tedium, the pain and the exhaustion of stages that could last more than 300&nbsp;km. That included alcohol, which was already strong in French culture and sometimes purer than water after World War I destroyed water pipes and polluted water tables, and ether. There are photographs of riders holding ether-soaked handkerchiefs to their mouths, or leaving them knotted under the chin so the fumes would deaden the pain in their legs.<ref>''Coups de P\u00e9dales'', Belgium, 2006</ref> The smell, enough to turn a man's stomach said Pierre Chany,<ref>Penot, Christophe (1996) ''Pierre Chany, l'homme aux 50 Tours de France'', \u00c9ditions Cristel, France</ref> discouraged some but also showed the extent of suffering by others. [[Roger Lap\u00e9bie]], winner of the Tour in 1937, said he smelled ether \"in the bunch near the finish; it used to be taken in a little bottle called a ''topette''.\"<ref>Tour Guide, UK, 1992</ref> Its use lasted decades; riders were caught using it as late as 1963.\n\nThe acceptance of drug-taking in the Tour de France was so complete by 1930, when the race changed to national teams that were to be paid for by the organisers, that the rule book distributed to riders by the organiser, [[Henri Desgrange]], reminded them that drugs were not among items with which they would be provided.<ref>Maso, Benji:Zweet van de Goden, Holland</ref> In a 1949 interview with Fausto Coppi, the 1949 and 1952 Tour winner, he admitted to [[amphetamine]] use and said \"those who claim [that cyclists do not take amphetamine], it's not worth talking to them about cycling\".<ref>Archive extract from Quando Volava l'Airone, part of a programme called Format, Rai Tre television, 1998</ref>\n\n=== The Convicts of the Road ===\nIn 1924 the journalist [[Albert Londres]] followed the Tour de France for the French newspaper, ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]''. At [[Coutances]] he heard that the previous year's winner, [[Henri P\u00e9lissier]], his brother [[Francis P\u00e9lissier|Francis]] and a third rider, [[Maurice Ville]], had pulled out after a row with the organiser, [[Henri Desgrange]]. Henri P\u00e9lissier explained the problem \u2013 whether or not he had the right to take off a jersey \u2013 and went on to talk of drugs, reported in Londres' race diary, in which he coined the phrase ''Les For\u00e7ats de la Route'' (The Convicts of the Road):\n\n[[File:1919pelissier.jpg|thumb|Right|250px|Henri Pelissier, 1919]]\n:\"You have no idea what the Tour de France is\", Henri said. \"It's a Calvary. Worse than that, because the road to the Cross has only 14 stations and ours has 15. We suffer from the start to the end. You want to know how we keep going? Here...\" He pulled a phial from his bag. \"That's cocaine, for our eyes. This is chloroform, for our gums.\"\n\n:\"This\", Ville said, emptying his shoulder bag \"is liniment to put warmth back into our knees.\"\n\n:\"And pills. Do you want to see pills? Have a look, here are the pills.\" Each pulled out three boxes.\n\n:\"The truth is\", Francis said, \"that we keep going on dynamite.\"\n\nHenri spoke of being as white as shrouds once the dirt of the day had been washed off, then of their bodies being drained by diarrhoea, before continuing:\n\n:\"At night, in our rooms, we can't sleep. We twitch and dance and jig about as though we were doing [[Dancing mania|St Vitus's Dance]]...\"\n\n:\"There's less flesh on our bodies than on a skeleton\", Francis said.<ref>Londres, Albert: Les fr\u00e8res P\u00e9lissier et leur camarade Ville abandonnent, ''Le Petit Parisien'', 27 June 1924, France</ref>\n\nFrancis P\u00e9lissier said much later: \"Londres was a famous reporter but he didn't know about cycling. We kidded him a bit with our cocaine and our pills. Even so, the Tour de France in 1924 was no picnic.\"<ref name=yellow>Woodland, Les ''Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', Yellow Jersey, London</ref><ref name=Dopage>De Mondenard, Dr Jean-Pierre: ''Dopage, l'imposture des performances'',  Chiron, France, 2000</ref>\n\n== 1950s\u20131960s: Early anti-doping stance ==\n[[Pierre Dumas]] was the first doctor to campaign for the testing and suppression of doping, both within cycling and then at international level at the Olympic Games. Dumas came to the Tour de France in 1952 when the original doctor pulled out. Dumas was a [[Judoka#Judoka (practitioner)|judoka]] rather than a cyclist and had none of the preconceptions established in cycling. He discovered a world in which \"there were soigneurs, fakirs, who came from the six-days. Their value was in the contents of their case. Riders took anything they were given, even bee stings and toad extract.\" He spoke of \"medicine from the heart of Africa... healers laying on hands or giving out irradiating balms, feet plunged into unbelievable mixtures which could lead to eczema, so-called magnetised diets and everything else you could imagine.

I always left frightened after these visits.\"<ref name=yellow /> At the 1956 Tour, it was evident how much drug-taking and the \"care\" of riders had changed.

Ten kilometres from the summit, said the journalist Jacques Augendre, French rider [[Jean Mall\u00e9jac]] was: \"Streaming with sweat, haggard and comatose, he was zigzagging and the road wasn't wide enough for him... He was already no longer in the real world, still less in the world of cyclists and the Tour de France.\"<ref name=yellow /> Mall\u00e9jac collapsed, falling to the ground with one foot still trapped in a pedal. The other leg pedalled on in the air. He was, said Pierre Chany, \"completely unconscious, his face the colour of a corpse, a freezing sweat ran on his forehead.<ref name=Chany />\n\nMall\u00e9jac was hauled to the side of the road by Sauveur Ducazeaux, an official of another team, and Dumas summoned. Georges Pahnoud of the ''T\u00e9l\u00e9gramme de Brest'' reported:\n\n:He had to force [Mall\u00e9jec's] jaws apart to try to make him drink and it was a quarter of an hour later, after he had received an injection of solucamphor and been given oxygen, that Mall\u00e9jac regained consciousness. Taken by ambulance, he hadn't however completely recovered. He fought, he gesticulated, he shouted, demanded his bike, wanted to get out.\n\nDumas had to strap Mall\u00e9jac down for the journey to hospital at Avignon. Mallejac insisted that he had been given a drugged bottle from a soigneur, whom he did not name, and said that while his other belongings had reached the hospital intact, the bottle had been emptied and could not be analysed.<ref>Zoom, ORTF, France, 11 July 1967</ref> Mall\u00e9jac insisted that he wanted to start legal proceedings, and Dumas said: \"I'm prepared to call for a charge of attempted murder.\" The incident was never resolved, however, with Mallejac returning for subsequent Tours and denying any wrongdoing for the rest of his life.\n\n=== Too drugged to pull on the brakes ===\nIn the 1960 Tour, [[Roger Rivi\u00e8re]] was second to the Italian [[Gastone Nencini]], a rider he planned to beat by tagging along with him in the mountains and then speeding away on the flat. The problem was that Nencini was lighter and a better climber and that he was such a fast descender that, in the view of another French rider, [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]], \"the only reason to follow Nencini downhill is if you've got a death wish.\"\n\n[[File:A la memoire de Roger Riviere 2.JPG|thumb|A monument recording the fall of Rivi\u00e8re.]]\nRivi\u00e8re was able to stay with Nencini on the climb to the [[Col de Perjuret]], as the pair crossed the summit together. Then came a series of descending zigzags. Nencini took the perfect line and Rivi\u00e8re, trying to match him, overshot a bend, fell into a ravine, and broke his back. There he was found by his teammate, [[Louis Rostollan]].\n\nRivi\u00e8re quickly passed the blame for his fall and his broken back on the team mechanic, accusing him of leaving oil on the wheels and the brakes for not working. The mechanic was outraged, and the doctors soon found the real reason \u2013 that so much painkiller was in Rivi\u00e8re's blood that his hands were too slow to operate the brakes. He had taken a heavy dose of the [[opioid]] painkiller [[dextromoramide]] (Palfium), to help him stay with Nencini on Col de Perjuret.<ref name=\"minovi\" /> Rivi\u00e8re later admitted to being a drug addict, telling a newspaper how he had doped to beat the world hour record,<ref>France Dimanche, France, cited Cycling, UK, 4 November 1967, p17</ref> and admitted downing thousands of tablets a year.\n\n=== Wiel's affair ===\nThe stage from Luchon to Carcassonne in 1962 set off 10 minutes later than scheduled because the German rider, [[Hans Junkermann]], had been ill most of the night. At first he was not going to start. When he said that after all he felt well enough, the organisers gave him the extra time to get ready. Junkermann was leader of the Wiel's-Groene Leeuw team and was allowed his privilege because he was in eighth position.\n\nJunkermann soon dropped to the back of the field and after 50&nbsp;km he lost contact. On the first hill he got off his bike and sat by the roadside. \"I ate bad fish at the hotel last night\", he told onlookers. The same complaint came all day. A total twenty riders fell ill, and eleven others abandoned the Tour that day, including the former leader, [[Willy Schroeders]], the 1960 winner Gastone Nencini and a future leader, [[Karl-Heinz Kunde]].\n\n[[Jacques Goddet]] wrote that he suspected doping but nothing was proven \u2013 other than that none of the hotels the previous night had served fish, the hoteliers being anxious to clear their reputation. Pierre Dumas spoke of \"certain preparations\" and speculated the riders were given the same tainted drug by one of the soigneurs.<ref name=\"minovi\" /> Team managers grew angry at the several days of newspaper reporting that followed and came close to calling for a strike.\n\n== 1965: Criminalization of doping ==\nIn 1960, the Danish rider [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] collapsed during the 100&nbsp;km team time trial at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]] in Rome and died later in hospital. The autopsy showed he had taken amphetamine and another drug, Ronicol, which dilates the blood vessels. Pierre Dumas then led a committee of doctors demanding tests at the following Games. A national anti-doping law entered French legislation in June 1965.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120804002349/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&dateJO=19650602&numTexte=&pageDebut=04531&pageFin= Loi n\u00b065\u2013412 du 1 juin 1965 tendant \u00e0 la r\u00e9pression de l'usage des stimulants \u00e0 l'occasion des comp\u00e9titions sportives]</ref> Performance-enhancing drugs were now illegal in France, and the first anti-doping testing began at the 1966 Tour. That year, amphetamine use in France was running at almost a third of those tested.<ref name=Dopage />\n\nAlec Taylor, team manager of rider [[Tom Simpson]] who died following doping usage in the 1967 Tour, said officials treated controls in fear, knowing what was there, afraid of what they might find.\n\n:Race officials, federations, even the law on the Continent have been lax. Before Tom's death I saw on the Continent the overcautious way riders were tested for dope, as if the authorities feared to lift the veil, scared of how to handle the results; knowing all the while what they would be. They called on the law to act, enabling them to shelter under its wing and feel secure from interminable court actions and claims. They let the show carry on while the law acted light-heartedly, without vigour and purpose \u2013 and its deterrent had no effect.<ref>Taylor, Alec, ''Cycling'', August 1967</ref>\n\n=== First anti-doping test and a strike ===\nTesters arrived at the Tour de France for the first time in 1966, in Bordeaux, although only after word had spread and many riders had left their hotels. The first competitor they found was [[Raymond Poulidor]], who became the first rider to be tested in the Tour. He said:\n\n:\"I was strolling down the corridor in ordinary clothes when I came across two guys in plain clothes. They showed me their cards and said to me: 'You're riding the Tour?'\n:\"I said: 'Yes'.\n:'You're a rider?'\n:\"I said: 'Yes'.\n:'OK, come with us.'\n:\"I swear it happened just like that. They made me go into a room, I pissed into some bottles and they closed them without sealing them. Then they took my name, my date of birth, without asking for anything to check my identity. I could have been anyone, and they could have done anything they liked with the bottles.\"<ref>Poulidor, Raymond: ''J'appartiens \u00e0 le l\u00e9gende'', L'\u00c9quipe, France, 12 July 1999</ref>\n\nA few other riders were found, including [[Rik Van Looy]]; some obliged and others refused. Next morning, the race left the city on the way to the Pyrenees and stopped in the suburb of Gradignan, in the university area of La House. The riders climbed off and began walking, shouting protests in general and in particular abuse at Pierre Dumas, whom some demanded should also take a test to see if he had been drinking wine or taking aspirin to make his own job easier.\n\n=== Death of Tom Simpson ===\n{{Main|Death of Tom Simpson}}\n[[Tom Simpson]] was the leader of the British team in the 1967 Tour de France. At the start of stage 13 on Thursday 13 July, he was still suffering the effects of a stomach bug he had endured earlier in the race. It was a blisteringly hot day, and he was seen to drink brandy during the early parts of the stage.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In those years, the organisers limited each rider to four bottles of water each, about two litres \u2013 the effects of [[dehydration]] being poorly understood. During races, riders often raided roadside bars and cafes for drinks, and filled their bottles from fountains.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nAbout two kilometres from the summit of the day's main climb, [[Mont Ventoux]], Simpson began to zig-zag across the road, eventually falling against an embankment.While his team-car helpers wanted him to retire from the race, Simpson insisted on being put back on his cycle and he continued for another 500&nbsp;m or so before again beginning to falter; he toppled unconscious into the arms of his helpers, still gripping his handlebars.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} A motorcycle policeman summoned Pierre Dumas, who took over team officials' first attempts at saving Simpson, including [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Dumas massaged Simpson's heart and gave him oxygen. A race helicopter then took Simpson to hospital but Simpson was declared dead soon after his arrival.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nDrug usage was only hinted at in the news coverage, particularly by [[Jacques Goddet]], who referred in L'\u00c9quipe to Simpson's \"errors in the way he looked after himself.\" Then a British reporter, J. L. Manning, broke the news that two empty tubes and a third full of amphetamines were found in the pocket of his jersey.<ref>Manning, J. L., 'Simpson was killed by drug', ''Daily Mail'', UK, 31 July 1967</ref> Manning was a serious and well-respected journalist. His exposure, the first time a formal connection had been made between drugs and Simpson's death, set off a wave of similar reporting in Britain and elsewhere. The following month, Manning went further, in a piece headed \"Evidence in the case of Simpson who crossed the frontier of endurance without being able to know he had 'had enough'\":\n\n:The question of whether Tommy Simpson's death in the Tour de France might have been prevented has one clear answer. Yes, and it should have been. Three days after this year's race, the French authorities announced that next October and November a French and Italian rider would be prosecuted for alleged doping offences in last year's Tour. France had surrendered the need rigrously to prevent doping to the discreet requirement of not tackling it on a big tourist occasion until a year had safely passed. It takes two days at most to analyse samples: it took a year for France to authorise prosecutions.\n\n:[\u2026] Is France trying to hush up the scandals of the Tour? I say yes. The first act of hushing up is not to attempt detection, let alone waiting a year before taking action. How much husher can you get?\n\n=== Steroids and allied drugs ===\n[[File:Eddy Merckx Canada 1974 WK.jpg|thumb|300px|Merckx at the 1974 World Cycling Championships held in Montreal.|right]]\nDuring 1974, a number of riders failed tests for amphetamines, including [[Claude Tollet]] at the Tour. In 1977, a test for amphetamine-like drug Pemoline was perfected, catching five-time Tour de France winner [[Eddy Merckx]] among others. Far from abandoning drugs, riders and their helpers concentrated on finding alternatives that could not be detected. Five-time Tour de France winner [[Jacques Anquetil]] argued that stopping riders using amphetamine would not stop doping, but merely lead riders to use more dangerous drugs. In the 1970s, cycling moved into the [[steroid]] era. According to Dr Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, steroids were not used to build muscle bulk, but rather to improve recovery and thereby let competitors train harder and longer and with less rest. There is also a secondary stimulant effect.\n\nDe Mondenard argued that such was the acceptance of steroids and then of corticoids that only the cost \u2013 which he put in prices of the time as between 35,000 and 50,000 French francs \u2013 was likely to restrict use. Only the richest or the most ambitious riders could afford that. And the rewards could be high: [[Bernard Th\u00e9venet]] won the 1975 and 1977 Tour de France editions by using [[cortisone]]. \"I was doped with cortisone for three years and there were many like me\", he said.<ref name=\"Thev01\" /> The experience had ruined his health, he said.\n\nSpanish rider [[Luis Oca\u00f1a]] failed tests in his last participation in the Tour de France in 1977 which was called the Tour of Doping.<ref>[http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1977/07/22/pagina-23/1028989/pdf.html?search=Oca%C3%B1a Thevenet: \"He ganado la revancha al infortunio] {{in lang|es}}.

''El Pais''. Retrieved 12 May 2012.</ref>\n\nTesting took time to adapt, but in 1978 Belgian rider [[Jean-Luc van den Broucke]] failed tests for steroid use, and said:\n\n:In the Tour de France, I took steroids. That is not a stimulant, just a strengthener. If I hadn't, I would have had to give up. [\u2026] On the first rest day, before we went into the Pyrenees, I had a first hormone injection. I had another one on the second day, at the start of the last week. You can't call that medically harmful, not if it's done under a doctor's control and within reason.\n\n:There was a mass of steroids used in the Tour, everyone will admit that. How can we stay at the top otherwise? Even at Munich [at the world track championship] it was used a lot. I hope the riders will get together next season and take action. Who can ride classics and long-distance Tours the whole year through without strengtheners?<ref>Soetaert, Eddy: De biecht van Jean-Luc van den Broucke, ''Het Volk'', Belgium, 18 October 1978.</ref>\n\n=== Pollentier incident ===\nRiders became adept at circumventing controls. Their advisers learned to calculate how long it would take a drug to move from blood into urine, and therefore how much time a rider could risk waiting before going to a drugs test. Sometimes, riders simply cheated, as was revealed to the world in 1978.\n\nThe rider was [[Michel Pollentier]], who that year was the Belgian national champion and therefore wearing his [[national colours]] of red, yellow and black. By the end of the stage which finished on [[Alpe d'Huez]] he had taken the race lead and could change his champion's jersey for the yellow jersey as leader of the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]].\n\nPollentier was called to the drugs test with [[Jos\u00e9 Nazabal]] and [[Antoine Gutierrez]]. Nazabal gave his sample but left the race that night. When Gutierrez went to provide his sample, the doctor \u2013 a man called Le Calvez spending his first day with the race \u2013 grew suspicious and tugged up his jersey, revealing a system of tubes and a bottle of urine. He then pulled down Pollentier's shorts and found him similarly equipped. Reports in the press called the supply of urine \u2013 somebody else's urine \u2013 as being in a bottle. Riders called it a \"pear\". In fact it was a condom. The tube ran from there to the riders' shorts so that pressure on the condom, held under the armpit, would give the impression of urinating.<ref name=Wilcockson>Wilcockson, John: The Tour de Farce \u2013 Pollentier, pills and that plastic tube, ''Sunday Times'', UK, 23 July 1978</ref>\n\nPollentier's manager, [[Fred De Bruyne]], who was in the test caravan, told a news conference:\n\n:I congratulated Michel and then sat down. On my left was Gutierrez, trying to provide a sample for the doctor, while Pollentier was in the other corner. They both had difficulty in urinating... Suddenly, the doctor cried out: 'What are you doing?' to Gutierrez. I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube had been in his pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.<ref name=Wilcockson />\n\nThe doctor said that Pollentier had not actually used the tube and so the test would go ahead as normal. At 8pm, the organiser, [[F\u00e9lix L\u00e9vitan]], told the press that the UCI had ruled that Pollentier would be fined 5,000 Swiss francs and start an immediate suspension of two months. The question was obvious: if a rider was prepared to take drugs and win a stage, knowing he would be tested, how many times had the ruse been shown to work before?\n\n== 1990s: The era of EPO ==\nWhen other drugs became detectable, riders began achieving the effects of transfusion more effectively by using [[erythropoietin]], known as EPO, a drug to increase red-cell production in anaemia sufferers. EPO became widespread, as a flurry of exposures and confessions revealed in 2006 and 2007. \"When I saw riders with fat arses climbing cols like aeroplanes, I understood what was happening\", said the Colombian rider, [[Luis Herrera (cyclist)|Luis Herrera]].\n\nEPO's problem for testers was that like testosterone and, before that, cortisone, they could not distinguish it from what the body produced naturally. For the first time, said Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, authorities had to settle not for the presence of a drug but its presence in unusual quantities. Testers set a haematocrit limit of 50 per cent and \"rested\" riders who exceeded it. [[Bjarne Riis]], the Danish rider who won the Tour in 1996, was known as \"Mr 60 per cent\" among riders.<ref>''Je ne cherche pas \u00e0 \u00eatre aim\u00e9'', Le Journal du Dimanche, France, 9 July 2007</ref> On 25 May 2007, he admitted he had used EPO from 1993 to 1998, including 1996 when he won the Tour.\n\nCynicism set in among both riders and officials. [[Jacques Goddet]], organiser of the Tour from 1936 to 1987, said in 1999:\n\n:I brought controls to the Tour in the wake of Tom Simpson's death in 1967 \u2013 and the riders went on strike. After the discoveries made [into the so-called 1998 Festina scandal, see below], I feel real resentment towards the medical and scientific powers who deceived us for 30 years. The controls are almost always negative, which means that the labs have been making serious mistakes, mistakes that have only served to speed up the growth of this evil. The controls we developed after Simpson's death were a lie, covered up by the highest scientific and medical authorities, and I condemn them.<ref>Goddet, Jacques, ''Procycling'', UK, December 1999</ref>\n\nSince 1997, the [[Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses]] is the testing laboratory of the [[Tour de France]].<ref>[http://www.doping.chuv.ch/en/lad_home/lad-qui-sommes-nous/lad-qui-sommes-nous-historique.htm History of the Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329193259/http://www.doping.chuv.ch/en/lad_home/lad-qui-sommes-nous/lad-qui-sommes-nous-historique.htm |date=29 March 2016 }}, www.doping.chuv.ch (page visited on 11 June 2014).</ref>\n\n=== 1998 Festina scandal ===\n{{Main|Festina affair|Doping at the 1998 Tour de France}}\n{{see also|Doping at the 1999 Tour de France}}\nOn 8 July 1998, French [[Customs (tax)|Customs]] arrested [[Willy Voet]], a soigneur for the [[Festina (cycling team)|Festina]] team, for the possession of illegal drugs, including [[narcotic]]s, [[erythropoietin]] (EPO), [[growth hormone]]s, [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]], and amphetamines. Voet later described many common doping practices in his book, ''Massacre \u00e0 la Cha\u00eene''.<ref>Voet, Willy (1999). ''Massacre \u00e0 la Cha\u00eene'' {{ISBN|2-290-30062-4}}. Translated as \"Breaking the Chain\", {{ISBN|0-224-06056-2}}</ref> On 23 July 1998, French police raided several teams' hotels and found drugs in the possession of the [[TVM (cycling team)|TVM]] team. As news spread, riders staged a sit-down strike during the 17th stage. After mediation by [[Jean-Marie Leblanc]], the director of the Tour, police agreed to limit the most heavy-handed tactics and riders agreed to continue. Many riders and teams had already abandoned the race and only 111 riders completed the stage. In a 2000 trial, it became clear that the management and health officials of Festina had organized drug-taking within the team. [[Richard Virenque]], a top Festina rider, finally confessed after being ridiculed for maintaining that if he was doping he was somehow not consciously aware of it \u2013 as the satirical television programme, ''[[Les Guignols de l'Info]]'', put it: \"\u00e0 l'insu de mon plein gr\u00e9\" (\"of my own free will but without my knowing\").\n\nIn the years following the 1998 [[Festina affair]], anti-doping measures were put into effect by race organizers and the UCI, including more frequent testing and new tests for [[blood doping]] [[blood transfusion|transfusions]] and EPO use. The [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) was also created to help governments in anti-doping.\n\nEvidence of drugs persisted and in 2004 came new allegations. In January, [[Philippe Gaumont]], a rider with the [[Cofidis (cycling team)|Cofidis]] team, told investigators and the press that [[steroid]]s, [[growth hormone|human growth hormone]], EPO, and amphetamines were endemic to the team. In June, British cyclist [[David Millar]], also of Cofidis, and [[time trial]] [[world cycling championship|world champion]], was detained by French police, his apartment searched and two used EPO syringes found. [[Jesus Manzano]], a Spanish rider then recently dismissed by the Kelme team, told the Madrid sports newspaper ''[[AS (newspaper)|AS]]'' he had been forced by his former team to take banned substances and that they had taught him to evade detection. The Kelme team itself was ultimately a casualty of the disclosures, which Manzano judged to be \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\"<ref>[http://velonews.competitor.com/2004/03/news/road/ex-kelme-rider-promises-doping-revelations_5743 \u201cEx-Kelme rider promises doping revelations\u201d] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328011750/http://velonews.competitor.com/2004/03/news/road/ex-kelme-rider-promises-doping-revelations_5743 |date=28 March 2016 }} Velo News, 20 March 2004.</ref>\n\n=== Lance Armstrong ===\n{{See also|L.

Suspicions arose initially over his association with Italian physician [[Michele Ferrari]] and his extraordinary achievements on the road. In 1999, Armstrong failed tests for a [[glucocorticosteroid]] hormone. Armstrong explained he had used an external [[cortisone]] ointment to treat a saddle sore and produced a prescription for it. The amount detected was below the threshold and said to be consistent with the amount used for a topical skin cream, but UCI rules required that prescriptions be shown to sports authorities in advance of use. Armstrong's former assistant, Mike Anderson, stated that Armstrong used a substance with a trade name similar to \"androstenine\".

allegations of doping in the [[Tour de France]] since the race began in 1903. Early Tour riders consumed [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and used [[diethyl ether|ether]], among other substances, as a means of dulling the pain of competing in endurance cycling.<ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/187085/202-7384003-1751816As{{dead link|date=April 2020}} ''History, Drugs and the Tour de France'' by [[Tim Moore (writer)|Tim Moore]]</ref> Riders began using substances as a means of increasing performance rather than dulling the senses, and organizing bodies such as the ''Tour'' and the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|International Cycling Union]] (UCI), as well as government bodies, enacted policies to combat the practice.\n\n[[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|Use of performance-enhancing drugs]] in cycling predates the Tour de France. Cycling, having been from the start a sport of extremes, whether of speed by being paced by tandems, motorcycles and even cars, or of distance, the suffering involved encouraged the means to alleviate it. Not until after World War II were sporting or even particularly health issues raised. Those came shortly before the [[death of Tom Simpson]] in the Tour de France of 1967. Max Novich referred to the Tour de France in a 1973 issue of ''New York State Journal of Medicine'' as \"a cycling nightmare\".<ref>Novich, Max M: Drug abuse and drugs in sports, ''New York State Journal of Medicine'', vol 73, no 21, 1 November 1973</ref> Journalist Hans Halter wrote in 1998 that \"For as long as the Tour has existed, since 1903, its participants have been doping themselves. For 60 years doping was allowed. For the past 30 years it has been officially prohibited. Yet the fact remains; great cyclists have been doping themselves, then and now.\"<ref>Halter, Hans: 'Alles verstehen, alles verzeihen', ''Der Spiegel'', Germany 3 August 1998</ref>\n\n== Early doping in cycling ==\n{{See also|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport}}\n[[File:Paris2.jpg|thumb|right|Major Taylor racing in Paris 1908]]\nDrug-taking in cycling predates the Tour de France. \"It existed, it has always existed\", said the French reporter and author, [[Pierre Chany]], who followed 49 Tours before his death in 1996.<ref>Penot, Christophe: ''Pierre Chany, l'homme aux 50 Tours de France'', \u00c9ditions Cristel, France, 1996</ref> The exhaustion of [[six-day racing|six-day races]] on the track was countered by the riders' soigneurs (the French word for \"carer\"), helpers akin to seconds in [[boxing]]. Among the treatments they supplied was [[nitroglycerine]], a drug used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and which was credited with improving riders' breathing.<ref>Novich, Max M., ''Abbotempo'', UK, 1964</ref> Riders suffered hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs. The American champion [[Major Taylor]] refused to continue the New York race, saying: \"I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand.\"<ref>Bearings, US, 24 December 1896, cited Ritchie, Andrew, ''Major Taylor'', Bicycle Books, US, 1988</ref>\n\nAlso used was [[strychnine]], which in small doses tightened tired muscles. A track rider of the era said he had developed such a tolerance to the drug that he took doses large enough to kill smaller men.<ref name=dope>Woodland, Les (1980) ''Dope, the use of drugs in sport'', David and Charles, UK</ref> The use of strychnine, far from being banned, was thought necessary to survive demanding races, says the sports historian Alain Lunzenfichter.<ref>Lunzenfichter, Alain: ''C'est pas du Jeu!'', ''L'\u00c9quipe'', France, 10 December 2007</ref>\n\nThe American specialist in doping, Max M. Novich, wrote: \"Trainers of the old school who supplied treatments which had cocaine as their base declared with assurance that a rider tired by a six-day race would get his second breath after absorbing these mixtures.\"<ref>Novich, ibid. Cited De Mondenard, Dr Jean-Pierre: ''Dopage, l'imposture des performances,  Chiron, France, 2000</ref> [[John Hoberman]], a professor at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas, said six-day races were \"de facto experiments investigating the physiology of stress as well as the substances that might alleviate exhaustion.\"<ref>Hoberman, John; \"[https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19462071/ Dopers on Wheels: The Tour's sorry history]\". Retrieved December 2007</ref>\n\nThe first backers of races on the road were newspapers. Although ''Le V\u00e9locip\u00e8de Illustr\u00e9'', which was behind the world's first long-distance road race in November 1869, said its purpose was \"to further the good cause of the bicycle\" because \"it must be determined that the bicycle can be raced over considerable distances with incomparably less fatigue than running\",<ref>''Le V\u00e9locip\u00e8de Illustr\u00e9'', Paris, 1 April 1869</ref> backing the race would also boost the newspaper's sales. In an era before radio and television, newspapers could build the drama of a race for weeks, rely on customers buying a further copy on the day to prepare for the riders to pass and then another next day to see what had become of them. Few people had travelled 130&nbsp;km, at least not often, and the idea of doing it by bicycle and at as high a speed as possible when the roads were potholed and bicycles had wooden wheels and metal tyres was exciting. The result was that newspapers outdid each other in promotions. In 1891 came a race from [[Bordeaux]] to Paris. In the same year, ''Le Petit Journal'' went twice as far by running [[Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris]] over 1,200&nbsp;km.\n\nDuring a meeting at ''L'Auto'' in Paris, journalist [[G\u00e9o Lef\u00e8vre]] suggested a race right round France, not just one day but six, \"like the six-day races on the track.\"<ref name=Chany>Chany, Pierre: ''La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France'', \u00c9ditions La Martini\u00e8re, France, 1988</ref> The idea of bringing the excess of the indoors to the roads of the outdoors was born. And with it came the practices which had seen riders through their suffering.\n\n== 1903-1940s: Doping as acceptable means ==\nThe strongest drug in the early Tour de France was strychnine. Other than that, riders would take anything to survive the tedium, the pain and the exhaustion of stages that could last more than 300&nbsp;km. That included alcohol, which was already strong in French culture and sometimes purer than water after World War I destroyed water pipes and polluted water tables, and ether. There are photographs of riders holding ether-soaked handkerchiefs to their mouths, or leaving them knotted under the chin so the fumes would deaden the pain in their legs.<ref>''Coups de P\u00e9dales'', Belgium, 2006</ref> The smell, enough to turn a man's stomach said Pierre Chany,<ref>Penot, Christophe (1996) ''Pierre Chany, l'homme aux 50 Tours de France'', \u00c9ditions Cristel, France</ref> discouraged some but also showed the extent of suffering by others. [[Roger Lap\u00e9bie]], winner of the Tour in 1937, said he smelled ether \"in the bunch near the finish; it used to be taken in a little bottle called a ''topette''.\"<ref>Tour Guide, UK, 1992</ref> Its use lasted decades; riders were caught using it as late as 1963.\n\nThe acceptance of drug-taking in the Tour de France was so complete by 1930, when the race changed to national teams that were to be paid for by the organisers, that the rule book distributed to riders by the organiser, [[Henri Desgrange]], reminded them that drugs were not among items with which they would be provided.<ref>Maso, Benji:Zweet van de Goden, Holland</ref> In a 1949 interview with Fausto Coppi, the 1949 and 1952 Tour winner, he admitted to [[amphetamine]] use and said \"those who claim [that cyclists do not take amphetamine], it's not worth talking to them about cycling\".<ref>Archive extract from Quando Volava l'Airone, part of a programme called Format, Rai Tre television, 1998</ref>\n\n=== The Convicts of the Road ===\nIn 1924 the journalist [[Albert Londres]] followed the Tour de France for the French newspaper, ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]''. At [[Coutances]] he heard that the previous year's winner, [[Henri P\u00e9lissier]], his brother [[Francis P\u00e9lissier|Francis]] and a third rider, [[Maurice Ville]], had pulled out after a row with the organiser, [[Henri Desgrange]]. Henri P\u00e9lissier explained the problem \u2013 whether or not he had the right to take off a jersey \u2013 and went on to talk of drugs, reported in Londres' race diary, in which he coined the phrase ''Les For\u00e7ats de la Route'' (The Convicts of the Road):\n\n[[File:1919pelissier.jpg|thumb|Right|250px|Henri Pelissier, 1919]]\n:\"You have no idea what the Tour de France is\", Henri said. \"It's a Calvary. Worse than that, because the road to the Cross has only 14 stations and ours has 15. We suffer from the start to the end. You want to know how we keep going? Here...\" He pulled a phial from his bag. \"That's cocaine, for our eyes. This is chloroform, for our gums.\"\n\n:\"This\", Ville said, emptying his shoulder bag \"is liniment to put warmth back into our knees.\"\n\n:\"And pills. Do you want to see pills? Have a look, here are the pills.\" Each pulled out three boxes.\n\n:\"The truth is\", Francis said, \"that we keep going on dynamite.\"\n\nHenri spoke of being as white as shrouds once the dirt of the day had been washed off, then of their bodies being drained by diarrhoea, before continuing:\n\n:\"At night, in our rooms, we can't sleep. We twitch and dance and jig about as though we were doing [[Dancing mania|St Vitus's Dance]]...\"\n\n:\"There's less flesh on our bodies than on a skeleton\", Francis said.<ref>Londres, Albert: Les fr\u00e8res P\u00e9lissier et leur camarade Ville abandonnent, ''Le Petit Parisien'', 27 June 1924, France</ref>\n\nFrancis P\u00e9lissier said much later: \"Londres was a famous reporter but he didn't know about cycling. We kidded him a bit with our cocaine and our pills. Even so, the Tour de France in 1924 was no picnic.\"<ref name=yellow>Woodland, Les ''Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', Yellow Jersey, London</ref><ref name=Dopage>De Mondenard, Dr Jean-Pierre: ''Dopage, l'imposture des performances'',  Chiron, France, 2000</ref>\n\n== 1950s\u20131960s: Early anti-doping stance ==\n[[Pierre Dumas]] was the first doctor to campaign for the testing and suppression of doping, both within cycling and then at international level at the Olympic Games. Dumas came to the Tour de France in 1952 when the original doctor pulled out. Dumas was a [[Judoka#Judoka (practitioner)|judoka]] rather than a cyclist and had none of the preconceptions established in cycling. He discovered a world in which \"there were soigneurs, fakirs, who came from the six-days. Their value was in the contents of their case. Riders took anything they were given, even bee stings and toad extract.\" He spoke of \"medicine from the heart of Africa... healers laying on hands or giving out irradiating balms, feet plunged into unbelievable mixtures which could lead to eczema, so-called magnetised diets and everything else you could imagine. In 1953 and 1954 it was all magic, medicine and sorcery. After that, they started reading Vidal [the French medicine directory].\"<ref>Council of Europe report, cited: Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France, Les Woodland, Yellow Jersey, London</ref>\n\nSuch was the extent to which stronger drugs entered cycling that the French team manager, [[Marcel Bidot]], was cited to an inquiry by the [[Council of Europe]] as saying: \"Three-quarters of riders were doped. I am well placed to know that since I visited their rooms each evening during the Tour. I always left frightened after these visits.\"<ref name=yellow /> At the 1956 Tour, it was evident how much drug-taking and the \"care\" of riders had changed. After stage 14, all members of the Belgian team chose to abandon the race following a \"mystery illness\". Insiders suspected doping usage as the real reason, while the team attributed the illness to a dinner of 'bad fish' they had eaten,<ref name=\"minovi\">[http://www.abcc.co.uk/Articles/DrgsTdeF.html Association of British Cycling Coaches (ABCC), Drugs and the Tour De France by Ramin Minovi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627210659/http://www.abcc.co.uk/Articles/DrgsTdeF.html |date=27 June 2007 }}</ref> an excuse which was reused in both 1962 and 1991.\n\nIn 1960, Pierre Dumas walked into a hotel bedroom on his nightly tour of teams to find eventual winner [[Gastone Nencini]] prone on his bed with a plastic tube running from each arm to a bottle containing hormones.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160115110423/https://books.google.com/books?id=RjAInSNJkbYC&pg=RA1-PA896&lpg=RA1-PA896&dq=les+deux+bras+reli%C3%A9s+%C3%A0+un+bocal,+se+pr%C3%AAtant+%C3%A0+une+double+perfusion+de+s%C3%A9rum+%C3%A0+base+d%E2%80%99hormones+m%C3%A2les&source=bl&ots=1f3IR-2gEH&sig=-eonYF8opzTe1mFN-mHOGyK2CQY&hl=da&ei=mv7GS563OMqBOLqXuZ4N&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, \"Dictionnaire du dopage\" (2004), p.896]</ref> However, the hormone injection was not illegal at the time, and indeed only few were disqualified or sanctioned whenever they were found out to use doping.<ref name=\"minovi\" />\n\n=== Mall\u00e9jac incident ===\nOn stage 12 of the 1955 Tour, the riders went over [[Mount Ventoux]]. Ten kilometres from the summit, said the journalist Jacques Augendre, French rider [[Jean Mall\u00e9jac]] was: \"Streaming with sweat, haggard and comatose, he was zigzagging and the road wasn't wide enough for him... He was already no longer in the real world, still less in the world of cyclists and the Tour de France.\"<ref name=yellow /> Mall\u00e9jac collapsed, falling to the ground with one foot still trapped in a pedal. The other leg pedalled on in the air. He was, said Pierre Chany, \"completely unconscious, his face the colour of a corpse, a freezing sweat ran on his forehead.<ref name=Chany />\n\nMall\u00e9jac was hauled to the side of the road by Sauveur Ducazeaux, an official of another team, and Dumas summoned. Georges Pahnoud of the ''T\u00e9l\u00e9gramme de Brest'' reported:\n\n:He had to force [Mall\u00e9jec's] jaws apart to try to make him drink and it was a quarter of an hour later, after he had received an injection of solucamphor and been given oxygen, that Mall\u00e9jac regained consciousness. Taken by ambulance, he hadn't however completely recovered. He fought, he gesticulated, he shouted, demanded his bike, wanted to get out.\n\nDumas had to strap Mall\u00e9jac down for the journey to hospital at Avignon. Mallejac insisted that he had been given a drugged bottle from a soigneur, whom he did not name, and said that while his other belongings had reached the hospital intact, the bottle had been emptied and could not be analysed.<ref>Zoom, ORTF, France, 11 July 1967</ref> Mall\u00e9jac insisted that he wanted to start legal proceedings, and Dumas said: \"I'm prepared to call for a charge of attempted murder.\" The incident was never resolved, however, with Mallejac returning for subsequent Tours and denying any wrongdoing for the rest of his life.\n\n=== Too drugged to pull on the brakes ===\nIn the 1960 Tour, [[Roger Rivi\u00e8re]] was second to the Italian [[Gastone Nencini]], a rider he planned to beat by tagging along with him in the mountains and then speeding away on the flat. The problem was that Nencini was lighter and a better climber and that he was such a fast descender that, in the view of another French rider, [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]], \"the only reason to follow Nencini downhill is if you've got a death wish.\"\n\n[[File:A la memoire de Roger Riviere 2.JPG|thumb|A monument recording the fall of Rivi\u00e8re.]]\nRivi\u00e8re was able to stay with Nencini on the climb to the [[Col de Perjuret]], as the pair crossed the summit together. Then came a series of descending zigzags. Nencini took the perfect line and Rivi\u00e8re, trying to match him, overshot a bend, fell into a ravine, and broke his back. There he was found by his teammate, [[Louis Rostollan]].\n\nRivi\u00e8re quickly passed the blame for his fall and his broken back on the team mechanic, accusing him of leaving oil on the wheels and the brakes for not working. The mechanic was outraged, and the doctors soon found the real reason \u2013 that so much painkiller was in Rivi\u00e8re's blood that his hands were too slow to operate the brakes. He had taken a heavy dose of the [[opioid]] painkiller [[dextromoramide]] (Palfium), to help him stay with Nencini on Col de Perjuret.<ref name=\"minovi\" /> Rivi\u00e8re later admitted to being a drug addict, telling a newspaper how he had doped to beat the world hour record,<ref>France Dimanche, France, cited Cycling, UK, 4 November 1967, p17</ref> and admitted downing thousands of tablets a year.\n\n=== Wiel's affair ===\nThe stage from Luchon to Carcassonne in 1962 set off 10 minutes later than scheduled because the German rider, [[Hans Junkermann]], had been ill most of the night. At first he was not going to start. When he said that after all he felt well enough, the organisers gave him the extra time to get ready. Junkermann was leader of the Wiel's-Groene Leeuw team and was allowed his privilege because he was in eighth position.\n\nJunkermann soon dropped to the back of the field and after 50&nbsp;km he lost contact. On the first hill he got off his bike and sat by the roadside. \"I ate bad fish at the hotel last night\", he told onlookers. The same complaint came all day. A total twenty riders fell ill, and eleven others abandoned the Tour that day, including the former leader, [[Willy Schroeders]], the 1960 winner Gastone Nencini and a future leader, [[Karl-Heinz Kunde]].\n\n[[Jacques Goddet]] wrote that he suspected doping but nothing was proven \u2013 other than that none of the hotels the previous night had served fish, the hoteliers being anxious to clear their reputation. Pierre Dumas spoke of \"certain preparations\" and speculated the riders were given the same tainted drug by one of the soigneurs.<ref name=\"minovi\" /> Team managers grew angry at the several days of newspaper reporting that followed and came close to calling for a strike.\n\n== 1965: Criminalization of doping ==\nIn 1960, the Danish rider [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] collapsed during the 100&nbsp;km team time trial at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]] in Rome and died later in hospital. The autopsy showed he had taken amphetamine and another drug, Ronicol, which dilates the blood vessels. Pierre Dumas then led a committee of doctors demanding tests at the following Games. A national anti-doping law entered French legislation in June 1965.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120804002349/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&dateJO=19650602&numTexte=&pageDebut=04531&pageFin= Loi n\u00b065\u2013412 du 1 juin 1965 tendant \u00e0 la r\u00e9pression de l'usage des stimulants \u00e0 l'occasion des comp\u00e9titions sportives]</ref> Performance-enhancing drugs were now illegal in France, and the first anti-doping testing began at the 1966 Tour. That year, amphetamine use in France was running at almost a third of those tested.<ref name=Dopage />\n\nAlec Taylor, team manager of rider [[Tom Simpson]] who died following doping usage in the 1967 Tour, said officials treated controls in fear, knowing what was there, afraid of what they might find.\n\n:Race officials, federations, even the law on the Continent have been lax. Before Tom's death I saw on the Continent the overcautious way riders were tested for dope, as if the authorities feared to lift the veil, scared of how to handle the results; knowing all the while what they would be. They called on the law to act, enabling them to shelter under its wing and feel secure from interminable court actions and claims. They let the show carry on while the law acted light-heartedly, without vigour and purpose \u2013 and its deterrent had no effect.<ref>Taylor, Alec, ''Cycling'', August 1967</ref>\n\n=== First anti-doping test and a strike ===\nTesters arrived at the Tour de France for the first time in 1966, in Bordeaux, although only after word had spread and many riders had left their hotels. The first competitor they found was [[Raymond Poulidor]], who became the first rider to be tested in the Tour. He said:\n\n:\"I was strolling down the corridor in ordinary clothes when I came across two guys in plain clothes. They showed me their cards and said to me: 'You're riding the Tour?'\n:\"I said: 'Yes'.\n:'You're a rider?'\n:\"I said: 'Yes'.\n:'OK, come with us.'\n:\"I swear it happened just like that. They made me go into a room, I pissed into some bottles and they closed them without sealing them. Then they took my name, my date of birth, without asking for anything to check my identity. I could have been anyone, and they could have done anything they liked with the bottles.\"<ref>Poulidor, Raymond: ''J'appartiens \u00e0 le l\u00e9gende'', L'\u00c9quipe, France, 12 July 1999</ref>\n\nA few other riders were found, including [[Rik Van Looy]]; some obliged and others refused. Next morning, the race left the city on the way to the Pyrenees and stopped in the suburb of Gradignan, in the university area of La House. The riders climbed off and began walking, shouting protests in general and in particular abuse at Pierre Dumas, whom some demanded should also take a test to see if he had been drinking wine or taking aspirin to make his own job easier.\n\n=== Death of Tom Simpson ===\n{{Main|Death of Tom Simpson}}\n[[Tom Simpson]] was the leader of the British team in the 1967 Tour de France. At the start of stage 13 on Thursday 13 July, he was still suffering the effects of a stomach bug he had endured earlier in the race. It was a blisteringly hot day, and he was seen to drink brandy during the early parts of the stage.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In those years, the organisers limited each rider to four bottles of water each, about two litres \u2013 the effects of [[dehydration]] being poorly understood. During races, riders often raided roadside bars and cafes for drinks, and filled their bottles from fountains.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nAbout two kilometres from the summit of the day's main climb, [[Mont Ventoux]], Simpson began to zig-zag across the road, eventually falling against an embankment.While his team-car helpers wanted him to retire from the race, Simpson insisted on being put back on his cycle and he continued for another 500&nbsp;m or so before again beginning to falter; he toppled unconscious into the arms of his helpers, still gripping his handlebars.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} A motorcycle policeman summoned Pierre Dumas, who took over team officials' first attempts at saving Simpson, including [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Dumas massaged Simpson's heart and gave him oxygen. A race helicopter then took Simpson to hospital but Simpson was declared dead soon after his arrival.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nDrug usage was only hinted at in the news coverage, particularly by [[Jacques Goddet]], who referred in L'\u00c9quipe to Simpson's \"errors in the way he looked after himself.\" Then a British reporter, J. L. Manning, broke the news that two empty tubes and a third full of amphetamines were found in the pocket of his jersey.<ref>Manning, J. L., 'Simpson was killed by drug', ''Daily Mail'', UK, 31 July 1967</ref> Manning was a serious and well-respected journalist. His exposure, the first time a formal connection had been made between drugs and Simpson's death, set off a wave of similar reporting in Britain and elsewhere. The following month, Manning went further, in a piece headed \"Evidence in the case of Simpson who crossed the frontier of endurance without being able to know he had 'had enough'\":\n\n:The question of whether Tommy Simpson's death in the Tour de France might have been prevented has one clear answer. Yes, and it should have been. Three days after this year's race, the French authorities announced that next October and November a French and Italian rider would be prosecuted for alleged doping offences in last year's Tour. France had surrendered the need rigrously to prevent doping to the discreet requirement of not tackling it on a big tourist occasion until a year had safely passed. It takes two days at most to analyse samples: it took a year for France to authorise prosecutions.\n\n:[\u2026] Is France trying to hush up the scandals of the Tour? I say yes. The first act of hushing up is not to attempt detection, let alone waiting a year before taking action. How much husher can you get?\n\n=== Steroids and allied drugs ===\n[[File:Eddy Merckx Canada 1974 WK.jpg|thumb|300px|Merckx at the 1974 World Cycling Championships held in Montreal.|right]]\nDuring 1974, a number of riders failed tests for amphetamines, including [[Claude Tollet]] at the Tour. In 1977, a test for amphetamine-like drug Pemoline was perfected, catching five-time Tour de France winner [[Eddy Merckx]] among others. Far from abandoning drugs, riders and their helpers concentrated on finding alternatives that could not be detected. Five-time Tour de France winner [[Jacques Anquetil]] argued that stopping riders using amphetamine would not stop doping, but merely lead riders to use more dangerous drugs. In the 1970s, cycling moved into the [[steroid]] era. According to Dr Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, steroids were not used to build muscle bulk, but rather to improve recovery and thereby let competitors train harder and longer and with less rest. There is also a secondary stimulant effect.\n\nDe Mondenard argued that such was the acceptance of steroids and then of corticoids that only the cost \u2013 which he put in prices of the time as between 35,000 and 50,000 French francs \u2013 was likely to restrict use. Only the richest or the most ambitious riders could afford that. And the rewards could be high: [[Bernard Th\u00e9venet]] won the 1975 and 1977 Tour de France editions by using [[cortisone]]. \"I was doped with cortisone for three years and there were many like me\", he said.<ref name=\"Thev01\" /> The experience had ruined his health, he said.\n\nSpanish rider [[Luis Oca\u00f1a]] failed tests in his last participation in the Tour de France in 1977 which was called the Tour of Doping.<ref>[http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1977/07/22/pagina-23/1028989/pdf.html?search=Oca%C3%B1a Thevenet: \"He ganado la revancha al infortunio] {{in lang|es}}.

''El Pais''. Retrieved 12 May 2012.</ref>\n\nTesting took time to adapt, but in 1978 Belgian rider [[Jean-Luc van den Broucke]] failed tests for steroid use, and said:\n\n:In the Tour de France, I took steroids. That is not a stimulant, just a strengthener. If I hadn't, I would have had to give up. [\u2026] On the first rest day, before we went into the Pyrenees, I had a first hormone injection. I had another one on the second day, at the start of the last week. You can't call that medically harmful, not if it's done under a doctor's control and within reason.\n\n:There was a mass of steroids used in the Tour, everyone will admit that. How can we stay at the top otherwise? Even at Munich [at the world track championship] it was used a lot. I hope the riders will get together next season and take action. Who can ride classics and long-distance Tours the whole year through without strengtheners?<ref>Soetaert, Eddy: De biecht van Jean-Luc van den Broucke, ''Het Volk'', Belgium, 18 October 1978.</ref>\n\n=== Pollentier incident ===\nRiders became adept at circumventing controls. Their advisers learned to calculate how long it would take a drug to move from blood into urine, and therefore how much time a rider could risk waiting before going to a drugs test. Sometimes, riders simply cheated, as was revealed to the world in 1978.\n\nThe rider was [[Michel Pollentier]], who that year was the Belgian national champion and therefore wearing his [[national colours]] of red, yellow and black. By the end of the stage which finished on [[Alpe d'Huez]] he had taken the race lead and could change his champion's jersey for the yellow jersey as leader of the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]].\n\nPollentier was called to the drugs test with [[Jos\u00e9 Nazabal]] and [[Antoine Gutierrez]]. Nazabal gave his sample but left the race that night. When Gutierrez went to provide his sample, the doctor \u2013 a man called Le Calvez spending his first day with the race \u2013 grew suspicious and tugged up his jersey, revealing a system of tubes and a bottle of urine. He then pulled down Pollentier's shorts and found him similarly equipped. Reports in the press called the supply of urine \u2013 somebody else's urine \u2013 as being in a bottle. Riders called it a \"pear\". In fact it was a condom. The tube ran from there to the riders' shorts so that pressure on the condom, held under the armpit, would give the impression of urinating.<ref name=Wilcockson>Wilcockson, John: The Tour de Farce \u2013 Pollentier, pills and that plastic tube, ''Sunday Times'', UK, 23 July 1978</ref>\n\nPollentier's manager, [[Fred De Bruyne]], who was in the test caravan, told a news conference:\n\n:I congratulated Michel and then sat down. On my left was Gutierrez, trying to provide a sample for the doctor, while Pollentier was in the other corner. They both had difficulty in urinating... Suddenly, the doctor cried out: 'What are you doing?' to Gutierrez. I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube had been in his pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.<ref name=Wilcockson />\n\nThe doctor said that Pollentier had not actually used the tube and so the test would go ahead as normal. At 8pm, the organiser, [[F\u00e9lix L\u00e9vitan]], told the press that the UCI had ruled that Pollentier would be fined 5,000 Swiss francs and start an immediate suspension of two months. The question was obvious: if a rider was prepared to take drugs and win a stage, knowing he would be tested, how many times had the ruse been shown to work before?\n\n== 1990s: The era of EPO ==\nWhen other drugs became detectable, riders began achieving the effects of transfusion more effectively by using [[erythropoietin]], known as EPO, a drug to increase red-cell production in anaemia sufferers. EPO became widespread, as a flurry of exposures and confessions revealed in 2006 and 2007. \"When I saw riders with fat arses climbing cols like aeroplanes, I understood what was happening\", said the Colombian rider, [[Luis Herrera (cyclist)|Luis Herrera]].\n\nEPO's problem for testers was that like testosterone and, before that, cortisone, they could not distinguish it from what the body produced naturally. For the first time, said Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, authorities had to settle not for the presence of a drug but its presence in unusual quantities. Testers set a haematocrit limit of 50 per cent and \"rested\" riders who exceeded it. [[Bjarne Riis]], the Danish rider who won the Tour in 1996, was known as \"Mr 60 per cent\" among riders.<ref>''Je ne cherche pas \u00e0 \u00eatre aim\u00e9'', Le Journal du Dimanche, France, 9 July 2007</ref> On 25 May 2007, he admitted he had used EPO from 1993 to 1998, including 1996 when he won the Tour.\n\nCynicism set in among both riders and officials. [[Jacques Goddet]], organiser of the Tour from 1936 to 1987, said in 1999:\n\n:I brought controls to the Tour in the wake of Tom Simpson's death in 1967 \u2013 and the riders went on strike. After the discoveries made [into the so-called 1998 Festina scandal, see below], I feel real resentment towards the medical and scientific powers who deceived us for 30 years. The controls are almost always negative, which means that the labs have been making serious mistakes, mistakes that have only served to speed up the growth of this evil. The controls we developed after Simpson's death were a lie, covered up by the highest scientific and medical authorities, and I condemn them.<ref>Goddet, Jacques, ''Procycling'', UK, December 1999</ref>\n\nSince 1997, the [[Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses]] is the testing laboratory of the [[Tour de France]].<ref>[http://www.doping.chuv.ch/en/lad_home/lad-qui-sommes-nous/lad-qui-sommes-nous-historique.htm History of the Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329193259/http://www.doping.chuv.ch/en/lad_home/lad-qui-sommes-nous/lad-qui-sommes-nous-historique.htm |date=29 March 2016 }}, www.doping.chuv.ch (page visited on 11 June 2014).</ref>\n\n=== 1998 Festina scandal ===\n{{Main|Festina affair|Doping at the 1998 Tour de France}}\n{{see also|Doping at the 1999 Tour de France}}\nOn 8 July 1998, French [[Customs (tax)|Customs]] arrested [[Willy Voet]], a soigneur for the [[Festina (cycling team)|Festina]] team, for the possession of illegal drugs, including [[narcotic]]s, [[erythropoietin]] (EPO), [[growth hormone]]s, [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]], and amphetamines. Voet later described many common doping practices in his book, ''Massacre \u00e0 la Cha\u00eene''.<ref>Voet, Willy (1999). ''Massacre \u00e0 la Cha\u00eene'' {{ISBN|2-290-30062-4}}. Translated as \"Breaking the Chain\", {{ISBN|0-224-06056-2}}</ref> On 23 July 1998, French police raided several teams' hotels and found drugs in the possession of the [[TVM (cycling team)|TVM]] team. As news spread, riders staged a sit-down strike during the 17th stage. After mediation by [[Jean-Marie Leblanc]], the director of the Tour, police agreed to limit the most heavy-handed tactics and riders agreed to continue. Many riders and teams had already abandoned the race and only 111 riders completed the stage. In a 2000 trial, it became clear that the management and health officials of Festina had organized drug-taking within the team. [[Richard Virenque]], a top Festina rider, finally confessed after being ridiculed for maintaining that if he was doping he was somehow not consciously aware of it \u2013 as the satirical television programme, ''[[Les Guignols de l'Info]]'', put it: \"\u00e0 l'insu de mon plein gr\u00e9\" (\"of my own free will but without my knowing\").\n\nIn the years following the 1998 [[Festina affair]], anti-doping measures were put into effect by race organizers and the UCI, including more frequent testing and new tests for [[blood doping]] [[blood transfusion|transfusions]] and EPO use. The [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) was also created to help governments in anti-doping.\n\nEvidence of drugs persisted and in 2004 came new allegations. In January, [[Philippe Gaumont]], a rider with the [[Cofidis (cycling team)|Cofidis]] team, told investigators and the press that [[steroid]]s, [[growth hormone|human growth hormone]], EPO, and amphetamines were endemic to the team. In June, British cyclist [[David Millar]], also of Cofidis, and [[time trial]] [[world cycling championship|world champion]], was detained by French police, his apartment searched and two used EPO syringes found. [[Jesus Manzano]], a Spanish rider then recently dismissed by the Kelme team, told the Madrid sports newspaper ''[[AS (newspaper)|AS]]'' he had been forced by his former team to take banned substances and that they had taught him to evade detection. The Kelme team itself was ultimately a casualty of the disclosures, which Manzano judged to be \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\"<ref>[http://velonews.competitor.com/2004/03/news/road/ex-kelme-rider-promises-doping-revelations_5743 \u201cEx-Kelme rider promises doping revelations\u201d] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328011750/http://velonews.competitor.com/2004/03/news/road/ex-kelme-rider-promises-doping-revelations_5743 |date=28 March 2016 }} Velo News, 20 March 2004.</ref>\n\n=== Lance Armstrong ===\n{{See also|L.

Suspicions arose initially over his association with Italian physician [[Michele Ferrari]] and his extraordinary achievements on the road. In 1999, Armstrong failed tests for a [[glucocorticosteroid]] hormone. Armstrong explained he had used an external [[cortisone]] ointment to treat a saddle sore and produced a prescription for it. The amount detected was below the threshold and said to be consistent with the amount used for a topical skin cream, but UCI rules required that prescriptions be shown to sports authorities in advance of use. Armstrong's former assistant, Mike Anderson, stated that Armstrong used a substance with a trade name similar to \"androstenine\". This resulted in a lawsuit against Anderson and a countersuit against Armstrong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7349292/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403035553/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7349292/|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 April 2005|title=Armstrong's lawyer: We won't be 'blackmailed'|publisher=MSNBC|date=2 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn late August 2005, one month after Lance Armstrong's seventh consecutive Tour victory, the French sports newspaper ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' claimed evidence that Armstrong had used EPO in the [[1999 Tour de France]].<ref>[http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/8740.0.html \u201cL'\u00c9quipe alleges Armstrong samples show EPO use in 99 Tour\u201d] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215122725/http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/8740.0.html |date=15 February 2006 }} Velo News, 23 August 2005.</ref> The claim was based on urine samples archived by the French National Laboratory for Doping Detection ([[LNDD]]) for research.

In addition, every rider is tested before the first day's stage, normally a short time-trial. Most teams are tested in their entirety at some point during the three-week race. Additional testing may take place during the off-season, and riders are expected to keep their national cycling federation informed of their whereabouts so they can be located.\nMany teams have their own drug testing programs to keep the team name clean.  Teams, such as Quick-Step, have pulled riders before they compete in major competitions.  Tom Boonen was pulled for cocaine before the 2008 Tour de France.\n\n== Status of Tour de France winners since 1961 ==\n14 of the 25 most recent winners (56%) have either failed tests or have confessed to have used doping.
