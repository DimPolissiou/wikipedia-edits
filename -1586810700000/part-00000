The four-year-old boy (Mummudi) Krishna Raja Wadiyar III, son of the last Wadiyar king, Khasa Chamaraja Wadiyar VIII, was anointed as the King of Mysore. Wadiyars were now subsidiaries of the British Raj and had to pay an annual subsidy to the British. However the British took over the administration of the kingdom on a specious plea of non-payment of the subsidy by Mummudi Krishna Raja Wadiyar in 1831, and British-appointed commissioners were then in charge of the kingdom.\n\nBritish commissioners administered Mysore from 1831\u20131881. [[Mark Cubbon]] (1834\u20131861) and [[L. B. Bowring]] (1861\u20131870) are among the well-known commissioners of the period.\n\nIn 1868, the British Parliament heeded the king's plea and decided to restore the kingdom to his adopted son Chamaraja Wadiyar IX. In 1881, the transfer of power back to the Wadiyars heralded an important phase in the making of modern Mysore. For the first time in India, democratic experiments were introduced by the establishment of a representative assembly. The next king, Nalvadi Krishna Raja Wadiyar, earned great fame as a saintly King-Rajarishi, and his kingdom was hailed as Ramarajya by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] as an ideal kingdom comparable to the one ruled by the historical hero [[Lord Rama]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nUnder British hegemony, the Wadiyars, freed from security concerns, shifted their attention to the patronage of the fine arts. They made Mysore a cultural center of Karnataka, fostering a number of famous musicians, writers and painters.\n\nThe last king of the Wadiyar dynasty was [[Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar]], who ruled from 1940 until Indian independence from British rule. In the year 1947, after India attained independence, he ceded his kingdom to the Dominion of India, but continued as the Maharajah until India became a Republic in 1950. He became the Raja Pramukh\u2014a constitutional position\u2014as the head of Mysore State in the Republic of India from 1950\u20131956. After the reorganization of the Indian states on a linguistic basis, he was appointed Governor of the integrated Mysore State (present Karnataka State) in 1956 and held the post until 1964.\n\nThen he was Governor of Madras state (now [[Tamil Nadu]]) for two years. The Indian Constitution continued to recognize him as the Maharajah of Mysore, until 1971, when [[Indira Gandhi|Mrs. Indira Gandhi]], then Prime Minister of India, abolished the titles and Privy Purse of over 560 Maharajahs. The Maharajah died in 1974. His only son, Srikantadatta Narasimha Raja Wadiyar (1953\u20132013), was a member of the Indian Parliament for many years.\n\n== Wadiyars Of Mysore ==\n{{for|details|Maharaja of Mysore}}\n\n== Curse on Wadiyars ==\n\nA curse was believed to be cast on the Wadiyars in 1612 by Alamelamma, wife of King Tirumalaraja, who ruled the [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. It is believed that when her jewels were being taken under the orders of the Wodeyar ruler, she ran over to a cliff overlooking the Kaveri river and cursed before jumping to death \u2014 \"Talakadu MaraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysooru Arasarige Makkalaagadirali\" (May [[Talakadu]] become a barren land, Malangi turn into a whirlpool and may Mysore kings never beget children). 400 years since, the Wadiyar dynasty never had any children for alternate generations. Hence the adopted child becomes the king. Even till date, most parts of Talakadu (Talakad) lie under sand, and Malangi village in present Mysore district is slowly eroding due to whirlpools.<ref>{{cite web | title = Does Alamelamma's curse continue to haunt Wadiyars? | url = http://www.deccanherald.com/content/373910/does-alamelamma039s-curse-continue-haunt.html |work=Deccan Herald|date=10 December 2013| accessdate = 2015-10-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = 400-year-old curse haunts Wodeyar royals of erstwhile princely state of Mysore|work=India Today | url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/wadiyar-royals-mysore-vijayanagara-empire-tirumalaraja-alamelamma-talakadu/1/330702.html |date=12 December 2013| accessdate = 2015-10-11}}</ref>{{cleanup section|reason=Needs to be rewritten|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe Mysore kingdom, founded by Yaduraya in the year 1399, consisted of only the areas surrounding the present Mysore City. The original fort was supposed to have been at a place known as haDadana \u2014 now a small village on the southern side of [[Chamundi Hill]]. The Wadiyars, like others at that time, were under the [[suzerainty]] of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Viceroy of the Vijayanagar kingdom was headquartered at [[Srirangapatna]]. Under Yaduraya, the Wadiyars increased their influence and territory over the next 200 years. Raja Wadiyar, the ninth ruler of the dynasty, was known for his valour and patronage of art and culture. He ruled from 1578 to 1617. In 1610, he conquered the fort of Srirangapatna from Tirumala, then Viceroy of Vijayanagar. Tirumala is said to have retired to Talakad with his two wives. One of them, Alamelamma, was a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki, the consort of Sri Ranganatha, the presiding deity of the famous Adi-Ranga temple in the island fortress of [[Srirangapatna]].\n\nTirumala suffered from a terminal disease on his back known as the \"disease of the kings\". The condition of Tirumala deteriorated and he died. Alamelamma had a large amount of precious jewellery, including a fine nose ring studded with a large pearl. As a widow she was no longer permitted jewellery. She donated the jewels to the temple of Sri Ranganayaki. Every Friday and Tuesday Sri Ranaganayaki was decorated with a large pearl-studded nose ring and other precious jewellery, which was put into the safe custody of Alamelamma the rest of the week, since she was known to be a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki.\n\nThe temple authorities requested Raja Wadiyar to give them the custody of the jewels, as was the normal practice. The treasury officials informed the king of this fact. Raja Wadiyar thought these jewels were of no value to Alamelamma, as she was now a widow and didn't have children, she would no longer need them. Raja Wadiyar sent emissaries to Malangi, where Alamelamma was staying, with a request to return the jewels. Only the pearl-studded nose ring was returned by Alamelamma. Raja Wadiyar then sent his army to Talakad to ask her once again and, if she refused, to seize them by force. To escape the wrath of the Mysore army, Alamelamma uttered the legendary curse on Raja Wadiyar and jumped into a whirlpool in the river Kaveri at Talakadu with the rest of the jewels and escaped unscathed. The curse, as passed down in folklore over the last 400 years, is:\n\n{{cquote|\u0ca4\u0cb2\u0c95\u0cbe\u0ca1\u0cc1 \u0cae\u0cb0\u0cb3\u0cbe\u0c97\u0cb2\u0cbf, \u0cae\u0cbe\u0cb2\u0c82\u0c97\u0cbf \u0cae\u0ca1\u0cc1\u0cb5\u0cbe\u0c97\u0cb2\u0cbf, \u0cae\u0cc8\u0cb8\u0cc2\u0cb0\u0cc1 \u0ca6\u0cca\u0cb0\u0cc6\u0c97\u0cb3\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cc6 \u0cae\u0c95\u0ccd\u0c95\u0cb3\u0cbf\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0ca6\u0cc6 \u0cb9\u0ccb\u0c97\u0cb2\u0cbf}}\n{{cquote|Talakadu maraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysuru Doregalige Makkallilade Hogali}}\n{{cquote|May Talakad turn into (a barren expanse of) sand, may Malangi turn into a whirlpool, may the Rajas of Mysore not have children (for all time to come).}}\n\nHearing of this extreme step taken by Alamelamma, Raja Wadiyar was truly repentant. He wanted to return the jewellery to the temple and not confiscate it for his own use. In his grief he had an idol of Alamelamma made in gold, installed it in the palace, and worshiped it as a deity. A remnant of her hair was preserved in a box. To this day, Alamelamma\u2019s idol can be found inside the Mysore Palace and is worshiped by the royal family. One can see the same huge pearl nose-stud adorning the Goddess Ranganayaki and Alamelamma today.\n\nThe Dasara festivities inside the palace end on the evening of Navarathri with a formal pooja to Alamelamma, and the kankana worn by the royal couple is removed thereafter paving the way for the Vijaya Dashami \u2013 Sami pooja the next day. For these nine days the royal couple are required to stay inside the precincts of the palace. Another interesting part of the story is that this Alamelamma temple is under the care of the legal heirs of Alamelamma: They live inside the Mysore Palace fort. Strangely, these priests/caretakers appear to be cursed, and they do not beget children and follow the same pattern afflicting the Wodeyars.\n\n==The Curse from the Time of Raja Wadiyar==\n\nAfter shifting to Srirangapatna, Raja Wadiyar is credited with holding the famous Dasara festivities for the first time in 1610. His only surviving son, Narasaraja Wadiyar, died (believed to be an effect of the curse in folklore) just a day before the commencement of Navaratri, but the king after consulting experts laid down the rule that the celebration of the ceremonies was not to be interrupted even by the death of members of the royal family. Raja Wadiyar was a devoted Vaishnavaite, and he donated the famous bejewelled crown to Lord Cheluvarayaswami of Melukote that is a feature of the Raja Mudi car festival even today. This is contrary to his own lineage as the Wadiyars regarded the temple of Karigiri Lakshmi Narasimha (Devarayana Durga, Tumkur) as their household deity. The mere fact that all the Wadiyars end their names by -\"Narasimharaja Wadiyar\" stands testimony to what was previously stated. This crown was confiscated from the royal Family by the Karnataka Government during an emergency. Legend has it that Raja Wadiyar, having entered the garbha\u2013gruha (sanctum sanctorum) of Cheluvarayaswami Temple on 20 June 1617, became one with the deity (aikya). Even today one can find a Bhakthi Vigraha of the King inside the Temple. Another Bhakthi Vigraha of the King can be found inside the Lakshmi-Narayanaswami Temple inside the Mysore Palace Fort. Malangi and Talakad are two small towns near [[Tirumakudalu Narasipura]] on the banks of the Kaveri where the river takes a bend. Talakad's temples lie buried in a vast expanse of sand and are dug up and exposed every 12 years. At Malangi, on the other hand, the river is at its deepest. Whether these phenomena appeared only after Alamelamma's curse in 1610 is a matter of conjecture. What can be stated with certainty is that the curse on the royal family seems to have come true. Their chief courtier Ram Nath Molahalli was the army head.\n\nFrom Raja Wadiyar\u2019s death in 1617 to that of [[Chikka Devaraja|Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar]] in 1704 (there were four rulers in between) the kingdom was ruled by the surviving descendants of Yaduraya, but none could beget legal heirs. Incidentally, Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar is credited with the composition of Gita Gopala \u2013 an opera in Kannada. The sole exception to the curse was Chikka Devaraja's deaf and mute son Kantheerava Narasaraja Wodeyar II, also known as Mookarasu. He was succeeded by his son Dodda Krushna Raja Wodeyar, who ruled from 1714 to 1732. With him Yaduraya\u2019s direct lineage came to an end. What followed was a succession of nominal rulers adopted by the surviving queens to continue the tradition. Traditional army commanders known as Dalvoys virtually ruled the kingdom and paved the way for the ascendancy of a foot soldier like Hyder Ali by 1762. There were five rulers from 1732 to 1796. In this period a definite pattern emerged under which no natural heir to the throne born to a king (adopted or otherwise) could beget children, whereas one who became king by virtue of adoption or other indirect inheritance was blessed with a legal heir. Hyder and Tipu continued the tradition of having a nominal Wodeyar King on the throne, and even the Dasara Celebrations continued as usual. After the famous [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] and the death of Tipu Sultan, a British army, in which the legendary [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] (later Duke of Wellington, also known as the Iron Duke) was serving, conquered Srirangapatna in 1799.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kingdom of Mysore]]\n* [[Mysore State]]\n* [[Hyderabad State]]\n* [[Baroda State]]\n* [[Gwalior State]]\n* [[Karnataka]]\n* [[Mysore]]\n* [[Talakad]]\n* [[Srirangapatna]]\n* [[C.

However the British took over the administration of the kingdom on a specious plea of non-payment of the subsidy by Mummudi Krishna Raja Wadiyar in 1831, and British-appointed commissioners were then in charge of the kingdom.\n\nBritish commissioners administered Mysore from 1831\u20131881. [[Mark Cubbon]] (1834\u20131861) and [[L. B. Bowring]] (1861\u20131870) are among the well-known commissioners of the period.\n\nIn 1868, the British Parliament heeded the king's plea and decided to restore the kingdom to his adopted son Chamaraja Wadiyar IX. In 1881, the transfer of power back to the Wadiyars heralded an important phase in the making of modern Mysore. For the first time in India, democratic experiments were introduced by the establishment of a representative assembly. The next king, Nalvadi Krishna Raja Wadiyar, earned great fame as a saintly King-Rajarishi, and his kingdom was hailed as Ramarajya by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] as an ideal kingdom comparable to the one ruled by the historical hero [[Lord Rama]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nUnder British hegemony, the Wadiyars, freed from security concerns, shifted their attention to the patronage of the fine arts. They made Mysore a cultural center of Karnataka, fostering a number of famous musicians, writers and painters.\n\nThe last king of the Wadiyar dynasty was [[Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar]], who ruled from 1940 until Indian independence from British rule. In the year 1947, after India attained independence, he ceded his kingdom to the Dominion of India, but continued as the Maharajah until India became a Republic in 1950. He became the Raja Pramukh\u2014a constitutional position\u2014as the head of Mysore State in the Republic of India from 1950\u20131956. After the reorganization of the Indian states on a linguistic basis, he was appointed Governor of the integrated Mysore State (present Karnataka State) in 1956 and held the post until 1964.\n\nThen he was Governor of Madras state (now [[Tamil Nadu]]) for two years. The Indian Constitution continued to recognize him as the Maharajah of Mysore, until 1971, when [[Indira Gandhi|Mrs. Indira Gandhi]], then Prime Minister of India, abolished the titles and Privy Purse of over 560 Maharajahs. The Maharajah died in 1974. His only son, Srikantadatta Narasimha Raja Wadiyar (1953\u20132013), was a member of the Indian Parliament for many years.\n\n== Wadiyars Of Mysore ==\n{{for|details|Maharaja of Mysore}}\n\n== Curse on Wadiyars ==\n\nA curse was believed to be cast on the Wadiyars in 1612 by Alamelamma, wife of King Tirumalaraja, who ruled the [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. It is believed that when her jewels were being taken under the orders of the Wodeyar ruler, she ran over to a cliff overlooking the Kaveri river and cursed before jumping to death \u2014 \"Talakadu MaraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysooru Arasarige Makkalaagadirali\" (May [[Talakadu]] become a barren land, Malangi turn into a whirlpool and may Mysore kings never beget children). 400 years since, the Wadiyar dynasty never had any children for alternate generations. Hence the adopted child becomes the king. Even till date, most parts of Talakadu (Talakad) lie under sand, and Malangi village in present Mysore district is slowly eroding due to whirlpools.<ref>{{cite web | title = Does Alamelamma's curse continue to haunt Wadiyars? | url = http://www.deccanherald.com/content/373910/does-alamelamma039s-curse-continue-haunt.html |work=Deccan Herald|date=10 December 2013| accessdate = 2015-10-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = 400-year-old curse haunts Wodeyar royals of erstwhile princely state of Mysore|work=India Today | url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/wadiyar-royals-mysore-vijayanagara-empire-tirumalaraja-alamelamma-talakadu/1/330702.html |date=12 December 2013| accessdate = 2015-10-11}}</ref>{{cleanup section|reason=Needs to be rewritten|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe Mysore kingdom, founded by Yaduraya in the year 1399, consisted of only the areas surrounding the present Mysore City. The original fort was supposed to have been at a place known as haDadana \u2014 now a small village on the southern side of [[Chamundi Hill]]. The Wadiyars, like others at that time, were under the [[suzerainty]] of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Viceroy of the Vijayanagar kingdom was headquartered at [[Srirangapatna]]. Under Yaduraya, the Wadiyars increased their influence and territory over the next 200 years. Raja Wadiyar, the ninth ruler of the dynasty, was known for his valour and patronage of art and culture. He ruled from 1578 to 1617. In 1610, he conquered the fort of Srirangapatna from Tirumala, then Viceroy of Vijayanagar. Tirumala is said to have retired to Talakad with his two wives. One of them, Alamelamma, was a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki, the consort of Sri Ranganatha, the presiding deity of the famous Adi-Ranga temple in the island fortress of [[Srirangapatna]].\n\nTirumala suffered from a terminal disease on his back known as the \"disease of the kings\". The condition of Tirumala deteriorated and he died. Alamelamma had a large amount of precious jewellery, including a fine nose ring studded with a large pearl. As a widow she was no longer permitted jewellery. She donated the jewels to the temple of Sri Ranganayaki. Every Friday and Tuesday Sri Ranaganayaki was decorated with a large pearl-studded nose ring and other precious jewellery, which was put into the safe custody of Alamelamma the rest of the week, since she was known to be a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki.\n\nThe temple authorities requested Raja Wadiyar to give them the custody of the jewels, as was the normal practice. The treasury officials informed the king of this fact. Raja Wadiyar thought these jewels were of no value to Alamelamma, as she was now a widow and didn't have children, she would no longer need them. Raja Wadiyar sent emissaries to Malangi, where Alamelamma was staying, with a request to return the jewels. Only the pearl-studded nose ring was returned by Alamelamma. Raja Wadiyar then sent his army to Talakad to ask her once again and, if she refused, to seize them by force. To escape the wrath of the Mysore army, Alamelamma uttered the legendary curse on Raja Wadiyar and jumped into a whirlpool in the river Kaveri at Talakadu with the rest of the jewels and escaped unscathed. The curse, as passed down in folklore over the last 400 years, is:\n\n{{cquote|\u0ca4\u0cb2\u0c95\u0cbe\u0ca1\u0cc1 \u0cae\u0cb0\u0cb3\u0cbe\u0c97\u0cb2\u0cbf, \u0cae\u0cbe\u0cb2\u0c82\u0c97\u0cbf \u0cae\u0ca1\u0cc1\u0cb5\u0cbe\u0c97\u0cb2\u0cbf, \u0cae\u0cc8\u0cb8\u0cc2\u0cb0\u0cc1 \u0ca6\u0cca\u0cb0\u0cc6\u0c97\u0cb3\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cc6 \u0cae\u0c95\u0ccd\u0c95\u0cb3\u0cbf\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0ca6\u0cc6 \u0cb9\u0ccb\u0c97\u0cb2\u0cbf}}\n{{cquote|Talakadu maraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysuru Doregalige Makkallilade Hogali}}\n{{cquote|May Talakad turn into (a barren expanse of) sand, may Malangi turn into a whirlpool, may the Rajas of Mysore not have children (for all time to come).}}\n\nHearing of this extreme step taken by Alamelamma, Raja Wadiyar was truly repentant. He wanted to return the jewellery to the temple and not confiscate it for his own use. In his grief he had an idol of Alamelamma made in gold, installed it in the palace, and worshiped it as a deity. A remnant of her hair was preserved in a box. To this day, Alamelamma\u2019s idol can be found inside the Mysore Palace and is worshiped by the royal family. One can see the same huge pearl nose-stud adorning the Goddess Ranganayaki and Alamelamma today.\n\nThe Dasara festivities inside the palace end on the evening of Navarathri with a formal pooja to Alamelamma, and the kankana worn by the royal couple is removed thereafter paving the way for the Vijaya Dashami \u2013 Sami pooja the next day. For these nine days the royal couple are required to stay inside the precincts of the palace. Another interesting part of the story is that this Alamelamma temple is under the care of the legal heirs of Alamelamma: They live inside the Mysore Palace fort. Strangely, these priests/caretakers appear to be cursed, and they do not beget children and follow the same pattern afflicting the Wodeyars.\n\n==The Curse from the Time of Raja Wadiyar==\n\nAfter shifting to Srirangapatna, Raja Wadiyar is credited with holding the famous Dasara festivities for the first time in 1610. His only surviving son, Narasaraja Wadiyar, died (believed to be an effect of the curse in folklore) just a day before the commencement of Navaratri, but the king after consulting experts laid down the rule that the celebration of the ceremonies was not to be interrupted even by the death of members of the royal family. Raja Wadiyar was a devoted Vaishnavaite, and he donated the famous bejewelled crown to Lord Cheluvarayaswami of Melukote that is a feature of the Raja Mudi car festival even today. This is contrary to his own lineage as the Wadiyars regarded the temple of Karigiri Lakshmi Narasimha (Devarayana Durga, Tumkur) as their household deity. The mere fact that all the Wadiyars end their names by -\"Narasimharaja Wadiyar\" stands testimony to what was previously stated. This crown was confiscated from the royal Family by the Karnataka Government during an emergency. Legend has it that Raja Wadiyar, having entered the garbha\u2013gruha (sanctum sanctorum) of Cheluvarayaswami Temple on 20 June 1617, became one with the deity (aikya). Even today one can find a Bhakthi Vigraha of the King inside the Temple. Another Bhakthi Vigraha of the King can be found inside the Lakshmi-Narayanaswami Temple inside the Mysore Palace Fort. Malangi and Talakad are two small towns near [[Tirumakudalu Narasipura]] on the banks of the Kaveri where the river takes a bend. Talakad's temples lie buried in a vast expanse of sand and are dug up and exposed every 12 years. At Malangi, on the other hand, the river is at its deepest. Whether these phenomena appeared only after Alamelamma's curse in 1610 is a matter of conjecture. What can be stated with certainty is that the curse on the royal family seems to have come true. Their chief courtier Ram Nath Molahalli was the army head.\n\nFrom Raja Wadiyar\u2019s death in 1617 to that of [[Chikka Devaraja|Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar]] in 1704 (there were four rulers in between) the kingdom was ruled by the surviving descendants of Yaduraya, but none could beget legal heirs. Incidentally, Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar is credited with the composition of Gita Gopala \u2013 an opera in Kannada. The sole exception to the curse was Chikka Devaraja's deaf and mute son Kantheerava Narasaraja Wodeyar II, also known as Mookarasu. He was succeeded by his son Dodda Krushna Raja Wodeyar, who ruled from 1714 to 1732. With him Yaduraya\u2019s direct lineage came to an end. What followed was a succession of nominal rulers adopted by the surviving queens to continue the tradition. Traditional army commanders known as Dalvoys virtually ruled the kingdom and paved the way for the ascendancy of a foot soldier like Hyder Ali by 1762. There were five rulers from 1732 to 1796. In this period a definite pattern emerged under which no natural heir to the throne born to a king (adopted or otherwise) could beget children, whereas one who became king by virtue of adoption or other indirect inheritance was blessed with a legal heir. Hyder and Tipu continued the tradition of having a nominal Wodeyar King on the throne, and even the Dasara Celebrations continued as usual. After the famous [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] and the death of Tipu Sultan, a British army, in which the legendary [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] (later Duke of Wellington, also known as the Iron Duke) was serving, conquered Srirangapatna in 1799.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kingdom of Mysore]]\n* [[Mysore State]]\n* [[Hyderabad State]]\n* [[Baroda State]]\n* [[Gwalior State]]\n* [[Karnataka]]\n* [[Mysore]]\n* [[Talakad]]\n* [[Srirangapatna]]\n* [[C.

The majority of these tombs were destroyed during the sixteenth through seventeenth century demolition of [[old St. Peter's Basilica]], except for one which was destroyed during the [[Arab raid against Rome|Saracen Sack of the church]] in 846. The remainder were transferred in part to new [[St. Peter's Basilica]], which stands on the site of the original basilica, and a handful of other [[churches of Rome]].\n\n==History==\nAlong with the repeated translations from the ancient [[catacombs of Rome]] and two fourteenth century fires in the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], the rebuilding of St. Peter's is responsible for the destruction of approximately half of all [[List of extant papal tombs|papal tombs]].

The majority of these tombs were destroyed during the sixteenth through seventeenth century demolition of [[old St. Peter's Basilica]], except for one which was destroyed during the [[Arab raid against Rome|Saracen Sack of the church]] in 846. The remainder were transferred in part to new [[St. Peter's Basilica]], which stands on the site of the original basilica, and a handful of other [[churches of Rome]].\n\n==History==\nAlong with the repeated translations from the ancient [[catacombs of Rome]] and two fourteenth century fires in the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], the rebuilding of St. Peter's is responsible for the destruction of approximately half of all [[List of extant papal tombs|papal tombs]]. As a result, [[Donato Bramante]], the chief architect of modern St. Peter's Basilica, has been remembered as \"''Mastro Ruinante''\".\n\nAlthough the original basilica's construction was begun during the reign of emperor [[Constantine I]] and completed in the fourth century, [[Pope Leo I]] (440\u2013461) was the first pope buried in the Constantian basilica.<ref name=\"rear40\">Reardon, 2004, p. 40.</ref> Over the centuries, both the atrium, chapels, and the nave of the basilica were packed with papal tombs, which were juggled between different sections of the church as construction took place on each section of the basilica. All that remains of the original tombs are a few sarcophagi and sculptural fragments.<ref name=\"r272\">Reardon, 2004, p. 272.</ref> Allegedly, [[Pope Julius II]], the pope who initiated the destruction of the Constantinian basilica, wished to clear space for a \"monstrous\" tomb of his own by [[Michelangelo]].<ref name=\"r274\">Reardon, 2004, p. 274.</ref>\n\nVery little is known about the placement and appearance of the original tombs: one of the most valuable accounts is that of church canon and historian [[Giacomo Grimaldi]] (a senator of Genoa and the father of [[Girolamo Grimaldi-Cavalleroni]]), who sketched the tombs as they were moved around the basilica on the way to their destruction;<ref>Grimaldi, Giacomo. Ed. R. Niggl. 1972. ''Descrizione della Basilica Antica di S. Pietro in Vaticano: Codice Barberini Latino 2733''. Vatican City.</ref> Grimaldi's sketches record the shape and complexity of the early tombs, many of which were three-tiered.<ref name=\"r272\"/> A few destroyed papal tombs are also detailed in the writings of [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]].<ref>Reardon, 2004, p. 12.</ref>\n\nNot all popes were buried in Rome.

Widely regarded as one of Australian football's finest centre half-backs, despite suffering numerous injuries, Knights was recognized for his contribution to the game when he was among the inaugural inductees into the [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]] in 1996<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/players/tabid/856/default.aspx Players in the Australian Football Hall of Fame]</ref> and later in the Hawthorn Team of the Century.<ref>[http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/team%20of%20the%20century/tabid/4819/default.aspx Hawthorn Team of the Century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223123516/http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/team%20of%20the%20century/tabid/4819/default.aspx |date=23 February 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Playing career ==\nKnights was raised on a dairy farm in [[Longwarry]], where he played for the local football club and attended school in neighbouring [[Drouin, Victoria|Drouin]].<ref name=\"knightsfarewell\">{{cite news|first=Hannah|last=Driscoll|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/sport/country-football/hawthorn-legend-peter-knights-prepares-for-vic-country-final-farewell/news-story/3d93377b409bd146e4c143889699853d|title=Hawthorn legend Peter Knights prepares for Vic Country final farewell|publisher=The Weekly Times|date=8 July 2016}}</ref> In his first two seasons at {{AFL Haw}}, Knights would get a taxi to training, then on the weekends would be driven to games by his parents. To make it easier for him to play without having to make long commutes to and from home, Knights was billeted with a family in Melbourne and finished his education at [[Camberwell High School]].<ref name=\"knightsfarewell\"/> He was in his own words a \"quiet and shy\" country kid when he arrived at Hawthorn, and it would be champion rover [[Peter Crimmins]] who helped Knights settle in at the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-10-07/crimmos-cup|date=7 October 2016|title=Crimmo's Cup - The story behind the Hawks' 1976 triumph and the famous photo|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au|first=Ashley|last=Browne}}</ref> He became easily identifiable on the field with his blond hair and his ability to frequently take spectacular high [[Mark (Australian football)|marks]]. He was also a great exponent of the drop kick and the torpedo punt kick.\n\nAfter playing only five games in his debut season, Knights established himself in the first team in 1970. The following year he did so well in that position that he was chosen for Victoria, winning the Simpson Medal for the best on ground in the match against [[Western Australia Australian rules football team|Western Australia]] in Perth. However, he missed out on Hawthorn's [[1971 VFL Grand Final|1971 premiership]] success due to a knee injury.\n\nKnights was moved briefly to full-forward in 1972 after a serious knee injury to [[Peter Hudson]] forced Hawthorn to experiment in the position before finally settling on [[Michael Moncrieff]]. He actually finished as Hawthorn's leading goal-kicking with 46 goals, but was moved back to defence before the season was over. After injury problems restricted his 1973 season, for the next three years Knights was rated the best centre half-back in the game. In 1975, Knights finally had the chance to participate in the first of four Grand Finals. [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] were too good on the day, winning their first-ever Premiership. Knights was Hawthorn's best player on the day, and capped off a fine personal year by winning the club Best and Fairest award.\n\nKnights' stellar form continued into 1976 before he suffered a broken [[collarbone]] early in the match against {{AFL Foo}} in Round 14, which ruled him out for the next seven matches.<ref>{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Allsop|title=Footy Flashbacks: Round 14|date=22 June 2016|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-06-22/footy-flashbacks-round-14}}</ref> Despite this, Knights still managed to come second in the [[1976 Brownlow Medal]] count, polling an astonishing 45 votes to finish three votes behind Essendon's [[Graham Moss]]. He shrugged off that disappointment to be one of Hawthorn's best players in the [[1976 VFL Grand Final]] triumph, later joining some of his teammates at [[Peter Crimmins]]' bedside.\n\nFrom 1977 onwards Knights was frequently rested up forward to reduce the risk of injuries, but still did enough great work at centre half-back to finish one vote behind [[Malcolm Blight]] in the [[1978 Brownlow Medal]] count. He would shrug off the disappointment of finishing runner-up in the Brownlow by starring in the [[1978 VFL Grand Final]]. After being knocked out while playing in defence, Knights was moved forward in the last quarter, where he took a series of fine marks and kicked two goals to help secure Hawthorn's fourth Premiership. During his stellar 1978 season Knights also claimed his second Simpson Medal with a dominant display for Victoria against WA in Perth.\n\nThe litany of injuries that Knights had suffered through his career began to catch up with him, and from 1979 to 1981, he played in only 26 out of a possible 66 games. Amid rumours of retirement, Knights rebounded to play impressive football in his final years. In 1983, he booted six goals in the Qualifying Final to guide Hawthorn to a thrilling four-point win against [[Fitzroy Lions|Fitzroy]], and was again among the best players on the field as the Hawks crushed {{AFL Ess}} in the [[1983 VFL Grand Final|Grand Final]]. \nKnights reached the 250-game milestone the following season against {{AFL StK}}, gathering 23 possessions and kicking two goals,<ref>{{cite web|title=The best 250th in Hawthorn history?|date=30 May 2016|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-05-30/the-best-250th-in-hawthorn-history|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au}}</ref> but a knee injury restricted him to just three further games. In 1985, Knights showed traces of brilliant form \u2013 kicking nine goals against {{AFL Car}} in Round 10. The Preliminary Final against {{AFL Foo}} would turn out to be his final VFL game. He had just four disposals, and was dropped for the Grand Final, a surprising decision for some people, given his reputation as a performer on the VFL's biggest stage. Yet again, Knights would bounce back from the disappointment to finish his career in a semblance of style, kicking a bag of goals to help Hawthorn defeat Carlton in the reserves Grand Final.\n\n== Coaching career ==\nAlthough Knights enjoyed spectacular success on the field, it was a different story as a coach. However, it should also be remembered that he was in charge of teams that were either relatively new and inexperienced (Brisbane), or undergoing restructuring (Hawthorn).\n\nIn 1986, the VFL decided to expand and include one team each from [[Western Australia]] and [[Queensland]]. The [[Brisbane Bears]], based on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[South East Queensland]], recruited Knights as their inaugural coach, despite his lack of coaching experience. The club won their first game, and although expectations of the new side were low, it was considered a significant achievement that the team was able to avoid finishing last in their first season.\n\nDespite this, the Bears' results in 1988 and 1989 failed to improve, with the club suffering regular thrashings. Besides the substandard quality of the training and playing facilities, lack of assistance from the VFL, and squad disharmony, Knights also had limited control over team selection; part way through the [[1988 VFL season]], he wanted star signing [[Warwick Capper]] dropped from the senior team due to poor form, but was overruled by club president [[Paul Cronin]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Pierik|publisher=The Age|date=6 May 2014|title=Warwick Capper's life with bad-news Bears|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/warwick-cappers-life-with-badnews-bears-20140506-zr5hn.html}}</ref> Knights was dismissed as coach with seven games remaining in the 1989 season<ref>[https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=hJsQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aZEDAAAAIBAJ&dq=peter-knights%20sacked&pg=6691%2C6848905 Shock and tears at golden boy's demise]</ref> and replaced with team [[psychologist]], [[Paul Feltham]]. Knights was considered to have been unlucky, as ineffective club management and poor relationships amongst his underperforming players seen as major contributing factors in the club's performance.\n\nAfter a brief coaching stint at Tasmanian club [[Devonport Football Club|Devonport]] from 1990 to 1993,<ref>http://www.devonportfc.com.au/history/listOnePositionType?positiontype=Senior%20Coach</ref> Knights returned to Hawthorn as senior coach for the 1994 AFL season. He managed to lead the team into the finals series, but were knocked out by {{AFL NM}} in the first final.

Widely regarded as one of Australian football's finest centre half-backs, despite suffering numerous injuries, Knights was recognized for his contribution to the game when he was among the inaugural inductees into the [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]] in 1996<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/players/tabid/856/default.aspx Players in the Australian Football Hall of Fame]</ref> and later in the Hawthorn Team of the Century.<ref>[http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/team%20of%20the%20century/tabid/4819/default.aspx Hawthorn Team of the Century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223123516/http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/team%20of%20the%20century/tabid/4819/default.aspx |date=23 February 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Playing career ==\nKnights was raised on a dairy farm in [[Longwarry]], where he played for the local football club and attended school in neighbouring [[Drouin, Victoria|Drouin]].<ref name=\"knightsfarewell\">{{cite news|first=Hannah|last=Driscoll|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/sport/country-football/hawthorn-legend-peter-knights-prepares-for-vic-country-final-farewell/news-story/3d93377b409bd146e4c143889699853d|title=Hawthorn legend Peter Knights prepares for Vic Country final farewell|publisher=The Weekly Times|date=8 July 2016}}</ref> In his first two seasons at {{AFL Haw}}, Knights would get a taxi to training, then on the weekends would be driven to games by his parents. To make it easier for him to play without having to make long commutes to and from home, Knights was billeted with a family in Melbourne and finished his education at [[Camberwell High School]].<ref name=\"knightsfarewell\"/> He was in his own words a \"quiet and shy\" country kid when he arrived at Hawthorn, and it would be champion rover [[Peter Crimmins]] who helped Knights settle in at the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-10-07/crimmos-cup|date=7 October 2016|title=Crimmo's Cup - The story behind the Hawks' 1976 triumph and the famous photo|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au|first=Ashley|last=Browne}}</ref> He became easily identifiable on the field with his blond hair and his ability to frequently take spectacular high [[Mark (Australian football)|marks]]. He was also a great exponent of the drop kick and the torpedo punt kick.\n\nAfter playing only five games in his debut season, Knights established himself in the first team in 1970. The following year he did so well in that position that he was chosen for Victoria, winning the Simpson Medal for the best on ground in the match against [[Western Australia Australian rules football team|Western Australia]] in Perth. However, he missed out on Hawthorn's [[1971 VFL Grand Final|1971 premiership]] success due to a knee injury.\n\nKnights was moved briefly to full-forward in 1972 after a serious knee injury to [[Peter Hudson]] forced Hawthorn to experiment in the position before finally settling on [[Michael Moncrieff]]. He actually finished as Hawthorn's leading goal-kicking with 46 goals, but was moved back to defence before the season was over. After injury problems restricted his 1973 season, for the next three years Knights was rated the best centre half-back in the game. In 1975, Knights finally had the chance to participate in the first of four Grand Finals. [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] were too good on the day, winning their first-ever Premiership. Knights was Hawthorn's best player on the day, and capped off a fine personal year by winning the club Best and Fairest award.\n\nKnights' stellar form continued into 1976 before he suffered a broken [[collarbone]] early in the match against {{AFL Foo}} in Round 14, which ruled him out for the next seven matches.<ref>{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Allsop|title=Footy Flashbacks: Round 14|date=22 June 2016|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-06-22/footy-flashbacks-round-14}}</ref> Despite this, Knights still managed to come second in the [[1976 Brownlow Medal]] count, polling an astonishing 45 votes to finish three votes behind Essendon's [[Graham Moss]]. He shrugged off that disappointment to be one of Hawthorn's best players in the [[1976 VFL Grand Final]] triumph, later joining some of his teammates at [[Peter Crimmins]]' bedside.\n\nFrom 1977 onwards Knights was frequently rested up forward to reduce the risk of injuries, but still did enough great work at centre half-back to finish one vote behind [[Malcolm Blight]] in the [[1978 Brownlow Medal]] count. He would shrug off the disappointment of finishing runner-up in the Brownlow by starring in the [[1978 VFL Grand Final]]. After being knocked out while playing in defence, Knights was moved forward in the last quarter, where he took a series of fine marks and kicked two goals to help secure Hawthorn's fourth Premiership. During his stellar 1978 season Knights also claimed his second Simpson Medal with a dominant display for Victoria against WA in Perth.\n\nThe litany of injuries that Knights had suffered through his career began to catch up with him, and from 1979 to 1981, he played in only 26 out of a possible 66 games. Amid rumours of retirement, Knights rebounded to play impressive football in his final years. In 1983, he booted six goals in the Qualifying Final to guide Hawthorn to a thrilling four-point win against [[Fitzroy Lions|Fitzroy]], and was again among the best players on the field as the Hawks crushed {{AFL Ess}} in the [[1983 VFL Grand Final|Grand Final]]. \nKnights reached the 250-game milestone the following season against {{AFL StK}}, gathering 23 possessions and kicking two goals,<ref>{{cite web|title=The best 250th in Hawthorn history?|date=30 May 2016|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-05-30/the-best-250th-in-hawthorn-history|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au}}</ref> but a knee injury restricted him to just three further games. In 1985, Knights showed traces of brilliant form \u2013 kicking nine goals against {{AFL Car}} in Round 10. The Preliminary Final against {{AFL Foo}} would turn out to be his final VFL game. He had just four disposals, and was dropped for the Grand Final, a surprising decision for some people, given his reputation as a performer on the VFL's biggest stage. Yet again, Knights would bounce back from the disappointment to finish his career in a semblance of style, kicking a bag of goals to help Hawthorn defeat Carlton in the reserves Grand Final.\n\n== Coaching career ==\nAlthough Knights enjoyed spectacular success on the field, it was a different story as a coach. However, it should also be remembered that he was in charge of teams that were either relatively new and inexperienced (Brisbane), or undergoing restructuring (Hawthorn).\n\nIn 1986, the VFL decided to expand and include one team each from [[Western Australia]] and [[Queensland]]. The [[Brisbane Bears]], based on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[South East Queensland]], recruited Knights as their inaugural coach, despite his lack of coaching experience. The club won their first game, and although expectations of the new side were low, it was considered a significant achievement that the team was able to avoid finishing last in their first season.\n\nDespite this, the Bears' results in 1988 and 1989 failed to improve, with the club suffering regular thrashings. Besides the substandard quality of the training and playing facilities, lack of assistance from the VFL, and squad disharmony, Knights also had limited control over team selection; part way through the [[1988 VFL season]], he wanted star signing [[Warwick Capper]] dropped from the senior team due to poor form, but was overruled by club president [[Paul Cronin]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Pierik|publisher=The Age|date=6 May 2014|title=Warwick Capper's life with bad-news Bears|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/warwick-cappers-life-with-badnews-bears-20140506-zr5hn.html}}</ref> Knights was dismissed as coach with seven games remaining in the 1989 season<ref>[https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=hJsQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aZEDAAAAIBAJ&dq=peter-knights%20sacked&pg=6691%2C6848905 Shock and tears at golden boy's demise]</ref> and replaced with team [[psychologist]], [[Paul Feltham]]. Knights was considered to have been unlucky, as ineffective club management and poor relationships amongst his underperforming players seen as major contributing factors in the club's performance.\n\nAfter a brief coaching stint at Tasmanian club [[Devonport Football Club|Devonport]] from 1990 to 1993,<ref>http://www.devonportfc.com.au/history/listOnePositionType?positiontype=Senior%20Coach</ref> Knights returned to Hawthorn as senior coach for the 1994 AFL season. He managed to lead the team into the finals series, but were knocked out by {{AFL NM}} in the first final. The following year the team finished second last, however, and Knights was again sacked.\n\nIn 2009, Knights was appointed senior representative coach of the [[Victorian Country Football League]] and held the position until 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hawthorn great Peter Knights to call it a day|date=29 April 2016|first=Hannah|last=Driscoll|publisher=The Weekly Times|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/sport/country-football/hawthorn-great-peter-knights-to-call-it-a-day/news-story/6215bc33e92cd6766ea78986ff3af82d}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n: ''Statistics are correct to the end of the 2016 season''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/P/Peter_Knights.html|title=Peter Knights \u2013 Stats|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{AFL player statistics legend}}\n{{AFL player statistics start}}\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1969 VFL season|1969]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 5 || 3 || 1 || 34 || 9 || 43 || 10 || - || 0.6 || 0.2 || 6.8 || 1.8 || 8.6 || 2.0 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1970 VFL season|1970]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 5 || 0 || 265 || 28 || 293 || 84 || - || 0.3 || 0.0 || 14.7 || 1.6 || 16.3 || 4.7 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1971 VFL season|1971]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 22 || 4 || 1 || 320 || 29 || 349 || 130 || - || 0.2 || 0.0 || 14.5 || 1.3 || 15.9 || 5.9 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1972 VFL season|1972]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 20 || 46 || 27 || 247 || 15 || 262 || 111 || - || 2.3 || 1.4 || 12.4 || 0.8 || 13.1 || 5.6 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1973 VFL season|1973]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 15 || 8 || 5 || 157 || 30 || 187 || 50 || - || 0.5 || 0.3 || 10.5 || 2.0 || 12.5 || 3.3 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1974 VFL season|1974]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 24 || 1 || 1 || 328 || 39 || 367 || 121 || - || 0.0 || 0.0 || 13.7 || 1.6 || 15.3 || 5.0 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1975 VFL season|1975]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 23 || 3 || 4 || 326 || 35 || 361 || 123 || - || 0.1 || 0.2 || 14.2 || 1.5 || 15.7 || 5.3 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1976 VFL season|1976]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 2 || 0 || 241 || 46 || 287 || 76 || - || 0.1 || 0.0 || 13.4 || 2.6 || 15.9 || 4.2 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1977 VFL season|1977]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 19 || 15 || 8 || 222 || 70 || 292 || 82 || - || 0.8 || 0.4 || 11.7 || 3.7 || 15.4 || 4.3 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1978 VFL season|1978]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 22 || 8 || 10 || 329 || 105 || 434 || 142 || - || 0.4 || 0.5 || 15.0 || 4.8 || 19.7 || 6.5 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1979 VFL season|1979]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 11 || 10 || 7 || 143 || 54 || 197 || 53 || - || 0.9 || 0.6 || 13.0 || 4.9 || 17.9 || 4.8 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1980 VFL season|1980]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 7 || 1 || 3 || 79 || 24 || 103 || 25 || - || 0.1 || 0.4 || 11.3 || 3.4 || 14.7 || 3.6 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1981 VFL season|1981]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 8 || 1 || 2 || 91 || 39 || 130 || 47 || - || 0.1 || 0.3 || 11.4 || 4.9 || 16.3 || 5.9 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1982 VFL season|1982]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 14 || 14 || 18 || 141 || 52 || 193 || 54 || - || 1.0 || 1.3 || 10.1 || 3.7 || 13.8 || 3.9 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1983 VFL season|1983]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 21 || 38 || 29 || 279 || 108 || 387 || 144 || - || 1.8 || 1.4 || 13.3 || 5.1 || 18.4 || 6.9 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1984 VFL season|1984]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 4 || 5 || 3 || 33 || 13 || 46 || 21 || - || 1.3 || 0.8 || 8.3 || 3.3 || 11.5 || 5.3 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1985 VFL season|1985]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 13 || 37 || 19 || 121 || 23 || 144 || 75 || - || 2.8 || 1.5 || 9.3 || 1.8 || 11.1 || 5.8 || -\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 264\n! 201\n! 138\n! 3356\n! 719\n! 4075\n! 1348\n! -\n! 0.8\n! 0.5\n! 12.7\n! 2.7\n! 15.4\n! 5.1\n! -\n|}\n\n== Personal life ==\nKnights had a son, Benjamin, in 1978 with his first wife Julie.

The community thought that they were in conspiracy with [[Hugh le Despenser the Younger]].

Southampton is home to the headquarters of both the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] and the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] of the Department for Transport in addition to cruise operator [[Carnival UK]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2007/12/12/26148/carnival-uk-signs-for-new-southampton-cruise-terminal.html |title=Carnival UK signs for new Southampton cruise terminal |publisher=TravelWeekly |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721203022/http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2007/12/12/26148/carnival-uk-signs-for-new-southampton-cruise-terminal.html |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businesssouthampton.com/content/default.asp?PageId=255 |title=Carnival UK |publisher=businesssouthampton.com |accessdate=5 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214052257/http://www.businesssouthampton.com/content/default.asp?PageId=255 |archive-date=14 December 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuring the latter half of the 20th century, a more diverse range of industry also came to the city, including aircraft and car manufacture, cables, electrical engineering products, and petrochemicals.

Two of these, a [[RORO|car ferry]] service and a fast [[catamaran]] passenger ferry service, provide links to [[Cowes|East Cowes]] and [[Cowes]], respectively, on the [[Isle of Wight]] and are operated by [[Red Funnel]]. The third ferry is the [[Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry|Hythe Ferry]], providing a passenger service to [[Hythe, Hampshire|Hythe]] on the other side of [[Southampton Water]].\n\nSouthampton used to be home to a number of ferry services to the continent, with destinations such as [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]], [[Lisbon]], [[Tangier]] and [[Casablanca]]. A ferry port was built during the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.plimsoll.org/Southampton/TheDocks/EasternDocks/OuterDock3.asp The result appeared to be very successful] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416223023/http://www.plimsoll.org/Southampton/TheDocks/EasternDocks/OuterDock3.asp |date=16 April 2008 }} Retrieved 2 January 2008</ref> However, a number of these relocated to Portsmouth and by 1996, there were no longer any car ferries operating from Southampton with the exception of services to the [[Isle of Wight]]. The land used for Southampton Ferry Port was sold off and a retail and housing development was built on the site. The Princess Alexandra Dock was converted into a marina. Reception areas for new cars now fill the Eastern Docks where passengers, dry docks and trains used to be.\n\n===Bus===\n[[File:Buses by Guildhall.jpg|thumb|Bluestar and First Southampton buses outside the Guildhall]]\nThe main [[bus]] operators are [[First Hampshire & Dorset|First Southampton]], [[Bluestar (bus company)|Bluestar]], [[Xelabus]] and Wheelers.

This is funded by the council and operated by SCA Support Services.\n\nThere are two main termini for bus services. First uses stops around Pound Tree Road and Vincent's Walk, except the X4 to Portsmouth and X5 to Gosport, which start and end their journeys from Westquay. This leaves the other terminal of West Quay available for other operators. [[Unilink]] passes West Quay in both directions, and the Salisbury Reds X7 service to Salisbury drops passengers off and pick them up there, terminating at a series of bus stands along the road. Certain Bluestar services also do this, while others stop at Bargate and some loop round West Quay, stopping at Hanover Buildings.\n\n===Tram===\n{{main|Southampton Corporation Tramways}}\nThere was a [[Southampton Corporation Tramways|tram system]] from 1879 to 1949.
