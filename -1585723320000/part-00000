Refrigerator cars differ from simple [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] boxcars and [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilated]] boxcars (commonly used for transporting [[fruit]]), neither of which are fitted with cooling apparatus. Reefers can be [[ice]]-[[Refrigeration|cooled]], come equipped with any one of a variety of mechanical refrigeration systems, or utilize [[carbon dioxide]] (either as [[dry ice]], or in liquid form) as a cooling agent. [[Milk car]]s (and other types of \"express\" reefers) may or may not include a cooling system, but are equipped with high-speed [[bogie|trucks]] and other modifications that allow them to travel with [[train|passenger trains]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background: North America===\n[[File:Illinois Central Railroad 14713.jpg|thumb|[[Illinois Central Railroad]] #14713, a ventilated fruit car dating from 1893]]\n\nAfter the end of the [[American Civil War]], [[Chicago, Illinois]] emerged as a major [[railway]] center for the [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of livestock raised on the [[Great Plains]] to Eastern markets.<ref>Boyle and Estrada</ref> Transporting the animals to market required herds to be driven up to {{convert|1200|mi|km}} to [[railhead]]s in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] or other locations in the midwest, such as Abilene and Dodge City, Kansas, where they were loaded into specialized [[Stock car (rail)|stock car]]s and [[transport]]ed live (\"on-the-hoof\") to regional processing centers. Driving cattle across the plains also caused tremendous weight loss, with some animals dying in transit.\n\nUpon arrival at the local processing facility, livestock were either [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]ed by wholesalers and delivered fresh to nearby butcher shops for retail sale, smoked, or packed for shipment in barrels of salt. Costly inefficiencies were inherent in transporting live animals by rail, particularly the fact that approximately 60% of the animal's mass is inedible.  The death of animals weakened by the long drive further increased the per-unit shipping cost. Meat processors sought a method to ship dressed meats from their Chicago packing plants to eastern markets.\n\n===Early attempts at refrigerated transport===\n[[File:Tiffany ad 1879 CBD.jpg|thumb|left|An advertisement taken from the 1st edition (1879) of the ''Car-Builders Dictionary'' for the '''Tiffany Refrigerator Car Company''', a pioneer in the design of refrigerated railroad cars]]\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, attempts were made to ship [[agriculture|agricultural]] products by rail. As early as 1842, the [[Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] was reported in the June 15 edition of the ''Boston Traveler'' to be experimenting with innovative [[freight car]] designs capable of carrying all types of perishable goods without spoilage.<ref>White, p. 31</ref> The first refrigerated boxcar entered service in June 1851, on the [[Northern Railroad (New York)]] (or NRNY, which later became part of the [[Rutland Railroad]]). This \"icebox on wheels\" was a limited success since it was only functional in cold weather. That same year, the [[Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad]] (O&LC) began shipping butter to Boston in purpose-built freight cars, utilizing ice for cooling.\n\n====Meat====\n{{anchor|meat|beef}}\nThe first consignment of dressed beef left the [[Union Stock Yards|Chicago stock yards]] in 1857 in ordinary [[boxcar]]s retrofitted with bins filled with ice. Placing meat directly against ice resulted in discoloration and affected the taste, proving to be impractical. During the same period [[Gustavus Franklin Swift|Gustavas Swift]] experimented by moving cut meat using a string of ten boxcars with their doors removed, and made a few test shipments to New York during the winter months over the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR). The method proved too limited to be practical.\n\n[[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit's]] William Davis patented a refrigerator car that employed metal racks to suspend the carcasses above a frozen mixture of ice and salt. In 1868, he sold the design  to [[George Hammond (industrialist)|George H. Hammond]], a Detroit meat packer, who built a set of cars to transport his products to Boston using ice from the [[Great Lakes]] for cooling.<ref>White, p. 33</ref> The load had the tendency of swinging to one side when the car entered a curve at high speed, and use of the units was discontinued after several derailments. In 1878 Swift hired engineer Andrew Chase to design a ventilated car that was well insulated, and positioned the ice in a compartment at the top of the car, allowing the chilled air to flow naturally downward.<ref>White, p. 45</ref> The meat was packed tightly at the bottom of the car to keep the [[center of gravity]] low and to prevent the cargo from shifting. Chase's design proved to be a practical solution, providing temperature-controlled carriage of dressed meats, This allowed [[Swift and Company]] to ship their products across the United States and internationally.\n\n{{anchor|Swift}}\nSwift's attempts to sell Chase's design to major railroads were rebuffed, as the companies feared that they would jeopardize their considerable investments in [[Stock car (rail)|stock cars]], animal pens, and feedlots if refrigerated meat transport gained wide acceptance. In response, Swift financed the initial production run on his own, then&nbsp;\u2014 when the American roads refused his business&nbsp;\u2014 he contracted with the GTR (a railroad that derived little income from transporting live cattle) to haul the cars into [[Michigan]] and then eastward through Canada. In 1880 the [[Peninsular Car Company]] (subsequently purchased by ACF) delivered the first of these units to Swift, and the Swift Refrigerator Line (SRL) was created.  Within a year, the Line's roster had risen to nearly 200 units, and Swift was transporting an average of 3,000 carcasses a week to [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Competing firms such as [[Armour and Company]] quickly followed suit. By 1920, the SRL owned and operated 7,000 of the ice-cooled rail cars. The [[General American Transportation Corporation]] would assume ownership of the line in 1930.\n\n[[File:Swift Refrigerator Line car, 1899.jpg|thumb|A [[builder's photo]] of one of the first refrigerator cars to come out of the [[Detroit]] plant of the [[American Car and Foundry Company]] (ACF), built for the [[Swift Refrigerator Line]] in 1899]]\n\n{{anchor|data}}\n'''Live cattle and dressed beef deliveries to New York ([[short ton]]s):'''\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n|\n|align=center | <small>''(Stock Cars)''</small>\n|align=center | <small>''(Refrigerator Cars)''</small>\n|-\n|align=center | &nbsp; '''Year &nbsp;'''\n|align=center | '''Live Cattle &nbsp;'''\n|align=center | '''Dressed Beef'''\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1882\n|align=center | 366,487\n|align=center | 2,633\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1883\n|align=center | 392,095\n|align=center | 16,365\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1884\n|align=center | 328,220\n|align=center | 34,956\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1885\n|align=center | 337,820\n|align=center | 53,344\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1886\n|align=center | 280,184\n|align=center | 69,769\n|}\n\n<small>The subject cars travelled on the [[Erie Railroad|Erie]], [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Lackawanna]], [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]], and [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]] railroads.</small>\n\n<small>Source: ''Railway Review'', January 29, 1887, p.&nbsp;62.</small>\n\n[[File:Early refrigerator car design circa 1870.jpg|thumb|A ''circa'' 1870 refrigerator car design.

In 1875, he invented a refrigerated railcar and crates that allowed him to grow peaches on a very large scale and ship them to distant markets. He was the first to achieve this. His innovations created Georgia's fame for peaches, a crop now eclipsed economically by blueberries.<ref name=\"georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu\">[http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/gahistmarkers/samuelrumphhistmarker.htm]</ref><ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/ga-blueberry-knocks-peach-off-top-fruit-pile-153423288.html Ga. blueberry knocks peach off top of fruit pile, Associated Press, July 21, 2013, published by Yahoo News on-line, retrieved July 21, 2013]</ref>\n\n[[Edwin T. Earl|Edwin Tobias Earl]] was born on a fruit ranch near Red Bluff, California on May 30, 1858. His father was Joseph Earl, his mother Adelia Chaffee, and his brother was Guy Chaffee Earl. He started his career in the shipping of fruits. By 1886, he was President of the Earl Fruit Company. In 1890, he invented the refrigerator car to transport fruits to the East Coast of the United States. He established the Continental Fruit Express and invested US$2,000,000 in refrigerator cars. In 1901, he sold his refrigerator cars to Armour and Company of Chicago and became a millionaire.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, manufactured ice became more common. The [[Pacific Fruit Express]] (PFE) - a joint venture between the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] and [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroads, with a fleet of 6,600 refrigerator cars built by the [[American Car and Foundry Company]] (ACF)<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventory of the Pacific Fruit Express Company Collection, 1906-1989|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf7199n8cr/|publisher=Online Archive of California|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> - maintained seven natural harvesting facilities, and operated 18 artificial ice plants. Their largest plant (located in [[Roseville, California]]) produced {{convert|1200|ST|t|lk=on}} of ice daily, and Roseville's docks could accommodate up to 254 cars. At the industry's peak, {{convert|1300000|ST|t}} of ice was produced for refrigerator car use annually.\n\n====Ice====\n{{anchor|ice}}\nThe use of ice to refrigerate and preserve food dates back to prehistoric times. Through the ages, the [[Ice trade|seasonal harvesting]] of snow and ice was a regular practice of many cultures. China, [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] stored ice and snow in caves, dugouts or [[Ice house (building)|ice houses]] lined with straw or other insulating materials. Rationing of the ice allowed the preservation of foods during hot periods, a practice that was successfully employed for centuries. For most of the 19th century, natural ice (harvested from ponds and lakes) was used to supply refrigerator cars. At high altitudes or northern latitudes, one foot tanks were often filled with water and allowed to freeze. Ice was typically cut into blocks during the winter and stored in insulated warehouses for later use, with sawdust and hay packed around the ice blocks to provide additional insulation. A late-19th century wood-bodied reefer required re-icing every {{convert|250|mi|km}} to {{convert|400|mi|km}}.\n{{anchor|Top icing}}\nTop icing is the practice of placing a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} to {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} layer of crushed ice on top of agricultural products that have high respiration rates, need high relative humidity, and benefit from having the cooling agent sit directly atop the load (or within individual boxes). Cars with pre-cooled fresh produce were top iced just before shipment. Top icing added considerable dead weight to the load. Top-icing a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} reefer required in excess of {{convert|10000|lb|kg|lk=on}} of ice. It had been postulated that as the ice melts, the resulting chilled water would trickle down through the load to continue the cooling process. It was found, however, that top-icing only benefited the uppermost layers of the cargo, and that the water from the melting ice often passed through spaces between the cartons and pallets with little or no cooling effect. It was ultimately determined that top-icing is useful only in preventing an increase in temperature, and was eventually discontinued.\n\n<gallery class=center>\nFile:Ice Harvesting on Lake St Clair Michigan circa 1905--photograph courtesy Detroit Publishing Company.jpg|Men harvest ice on [[Michigan|Michigan's]] [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake Saint Clair]], ''circa'' 1905.

The use of similar \"billboard\" [[advertising]] on [[freight car]]s was banned by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] in 1937, and thereafter cars so decorated could no longer be accepted for interchange between roads\n</gallery>\n\n{{anchor|insulation}}\nRefrigerator cars required effective insulation to protect their contents from temperature extremes. \"[[felt|Hairfelt]]\" derived from compressed cattle hair, sandwiched into the floor and walls of the car, was inexpensive, yet flawed&nbsp; over its three- to four-year service life it would decay, rotting out the car's wooden partitions and tainting the cargo with a foul odor. The higher cost of other materials such as \"Linofelt\" (woven from [[flax]] fibers) or [[cork (material)|cork]] prevented their widespread adoption. Synthetic materials such as [[fiberglass]] and [[polystyrene]] foam, both introduced after [[World War II]], offered the most cost-effective and practical solution.\n\nThe United States Office of Defense Transportation implemented mandatory pooling of class RS produce refrigerator cars from 1941 through 1948. [[World War II]] experience found the cars spending 60 percent of their time traveling loaded, 30 percent traveling empty, and 10 percent idle; and indicated the average 14 loads each car carried per year included 5 requiring bunker icing, 1 requiring heating, and 8 using ventilation or top icing.<ref name=rmc>{{cite journal |last1=Lambert |first1=Dave |last2=Lambert |first2=Jenny |year=1994 |title=The post war refrigerator car -- a brief history: part I |journal=Railroad Model Craftsman |volume= |issue=March |pages=86\u201394 |publisher=Carstens Publications }}</ref>\n{{anchor|features}}\n\nFollowing experience with assorted car specifications, the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association (UFF&VA) listed what they considered the best features of ice refrigerator cars in 1948:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lambert |first1=Dave |last2=Lambert |first2=Jenny |year=1994 |title=The post war refrigerator car -- a brief history: part II |journal=Railroad Model Craftsman |volume= |issue=April |pages=86\u201393 |publisher=Carstens Publications }}</ref>\n* Steel cars (vs wood) for better insulation protection and greater rigidity resulting in reduced leakage around doors\n* A minimum of {{convert|4|in|cm}} insulation thickness with all insulation protected from moisture\n* Cushioned trucks and [[draft gear]] to minimize jarring and bruising of produce\n* Standardized interior dimensions to allow improved loading methods with standardized containers\n* Adjustable ice bunker bulkheads to allow greater floor space for shippers using top icing alone\n* Vertically adjustable grates within the ice bunkers to allow half-stage icing to reduce icing charges where appropriate\n* Forced air circulation within the car\n* An additional lining to allow side wall flues circulating air around all cargo preventing contact with exterior car walls\n* Perforated floor racks providing similar protection and air circulation under the cargo\n* Provisions for pre-cooling the cars with a portable unit at the loading platforms.\n\n===Mechanical refrigeration===\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, mechanical refrigeration began to replace ice-based systems. Soon after, mechanical refrigeration units replaced the \"armies\" of personnel required to re-ice the cars. The [[Bus doors#Sliding plug doors|sliding plug door]] was introduced experimentally by P.F.E. (Pacific Fruit Express) in April 1947, when one of their R-40-10 series cars, #42626, was equipped with one. P.F.E.'s R-40-26 series reefers, designed in 1949 and built in 1951, were the first production series cars to be so equipped. In addition, the Santa Fe Railroad first used plug doors on their SFRD RR-47 series cars, which were also built in 1951. This type of door provided a larger six foot opening to facilitate car loading and unloading. These tight-fitting doors were better insulated and could maintain an even temperature inside the car. By the mid-1970s, the few remaining ice bunker cars were relegated to \"top-ice\" service, where crushed ice was applied atop the commodity.\n\n===Cryogenic refrigeration===\nThe [[Topeka, Kansas]] shops of the Santa Fe Railway built five experimental refrigerator cars employing [[liquid nitrogen]] as the cooling agent in 1965. A mist induced by liquified nitrogen was released throughout the car if the temperature rose above a pre-determined level. Each car carried {{convert|3000|lb|kg}} of refrigerant and could maintain a temperature of minus 20 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (&minus;30&nbsp;\u00b0C). During the 1990s, a few railcar manufacturers experimented with the use of [[liquid carbon dioxide]] (CO<small><sub >2</sub></small>) as a cooling agent. The move was in response to rising fuel costs, and was an attempt to eliminate the standard mechanical refrigeration systems that required periodic maintenance. The CO<small><sub >2</sub></small> system can keep the cargo frozen solid as long as 14 to 16 days.\n\nSeveral hundred \"[[cryogenic]]\" refrigerator cars were placed in service transporting frozen foodstuffs, though they failed to gain wide acceptance (due, in part, to the rising cost of liquid carbon dioxide). Because cryogenic refrigeration is a proven technology and environmentally friendly, the rising price of fuel and the increased availability of carbon dioxide from [[Kyoto Protocol]]-induced capturing techniques may lead to a resurgence in cryogenic railcar usage.\n\n===Experimentation===\n\n====Aluminum and stainless steel====\nSeveral experimental cars were built when wartime production restrictions were relaxed in 1946:\n\n* [[Illinois Central Railroad]] number 51000 was built in the [[McComb, Mississippi]] <ref>http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/rspicture.aspx?id=64684</ref> shops with an aluminum superstructure to reduce weight with steel where required for strength and provided the standard dimensions, cushioned draft gear, easy-riding trucks, minimum {{convert|4|in|cm}} of insulation, adjustable ice bunker bulkheads and half-stage icing racks with forced air circulation through side wall flues and floor racks recommended by UFF&VA.<ref name=rmc/>\n* [[Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch]] number 13000 was built of [[stainless steel]] by the [[Consolidated Steel Corporation]] of [[Wilmington, California]] with convertible ice bunkers, side ventilation ducts, and axle-driven circulation fans. It was thought that stainless steel would better resist the corrosive deterioration resulting from salting the ice. The one-of-a-kind unit entered service as #13000, but was subsequently redesignated as #1300, and later given #4150 in 1955.<ref>Hendrickson and Scholz, p. 8</ref> The car spent most of its life in express service. Cost was cited as the reason no additional units were ordered. The car was dismantled at [[Clovis, New Mexico]] in February 1964.\n* Pacific Fruit Express rebuilt two steel-sided ventilator refrigerator cars in their [[Los Angeles]] shops with aluminum car bodies to test durability of lightweight alloys versus that of steel.<ref name=rmc/> It was hoped that weight savings (the units weighed almost {{convert|10000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} less than a like-sized all-steel car) and better corrosion resistance would offset the higher initial cost. [[Alcoa]] provided the body for number 44739, and [[Reynolds Metals|Reynolds Aluminum Company]] provided number 45698. The cars (outfitted with state-of-the-art fiberglass insulation and axle-driven fans for internal air circulation) traveled throughout the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific systems, where they were displayed to promote PFE's post-[[World War II]] modernization. Though both units remained in service over 15 years (#45698 was destroyed in a wreck in May 1962, while #44739 was scrapped in 1966), no additional aluminum reefers were constructed.\n* [[Fruit Growers Express]] number 38374 was equipped with an experimental aluminum body in the [[Indiana Harbor, Indiana]] shops.<ref name=rmc/>\n\n====\"Depression Baby\"====\nDuring the 1930s, the [[North American Car Company]] produced a one-of-a-kind, four-wheeled ice bunker reefer intended to serve the needs of specialized shippers who did not generate sufficient product to fill a full-sized refrigerator car. NADX #10000 was a {{convert|22|ft|m|2|adj=on}}<!-- rather short??? -->-long, all-steel car that resembled the [[forty-and-eights]] used in Europe during [[World War I]]. The prototype weighed {{convert|13.5|ST|t LT}} and was outfitted with a {{convert|1500|lb|abbr=on}} ice bunker at each end. The car was leased to [[Hormel]] and saw service between [[Chicago, Illinois]] and the southern United States. The concept failed to gain acceptance with eastern railroads and no additional units were built.\n\n====Dry ice====\nThe Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch (SFRD) briefly experimented with [[dry ice]] as a cooling agent in 1931. The compound was readily available and seemed like an ideal replacement for frozen water. Dry ice melts at {{convert|-109|\u00b0F|2|disp=or}} (versus {{convert|32|\u00b0F|disp=or}} for conventional ice) and was twice as effective thermodynamically. Overall weight was reduced as the need for brine and water was eliminated. While the higher cost of dry ice was certainly a drawback, logistical issues in loading long lines of cars efficiently prevented it from gaining acceptance over conventional ice. Worst of all, it was found that dry ice can adversely affect the color and flavor of certain foods if placed too closely to them.\n\n====Hopper cars====\nIn 1969, the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] ordered a number of modified [[covered hopper]] cars from [[American Car and Foundry]] for transporting perishable food in bulk. The {{convert|55|ft|m|2|adj=on}}-long  cars were blanketed with a layer of insulation, equipped with roof hatches for loading, and had centerflow openings along the bottom for fast discharge. A mechanical refrigeration unit was installed at each end of the car, where sheet metal ducting forced cool air into the cargo compartments.\n\nThe units, rated at {{convert|100|ST|t LT}} capacity (more than twice that of the largest conventional refrigerator car of the day) were economical to load and unload, as no secondary packaging was required. Apples, carrots, onions, and potatoes were transported in this manner with moderate success. Oranges, on the other hand, tended to burst under their own weight, even after wooden baffles were installed to better distribute the load. The Santa Fe Railway leased 100 of the hoppers from ACF, and in April 1972 purchased 100 new units, known as \"Conditionaire\" cars.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.kansasmemory.org/mobile/i/213800\n|title = Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe covered Hopper Conditionaire car\n|publisher = Kansas Historical Society\n|date =  2007\u20132012\n|accessdate = 2012-04-01}}</ref>\n\nThe cars' irregular, orange-colored outer surface (though darker than the standard AT&SF yellow-orange used on reefers) tended to collect dirt easily, and proved difficult to clean. Santa Fe eventually relegated the cars to more typical, non-refrigerated applications.\n\n===Preservation===\nExamples of many styles of refrigerator and ice cars can be found at railroad museums around the world.\n\nThe [[Western Pacific Railroad Museum]] at [[Portola, California]] features a very complete roster of 20th century cars, including wood bodied ice cars, steel bodied ice cars, one of the earliest mechanical refrigerator cars, later mechanical refrigerator cars and a cryogenic reefer, as well as several \"insulated\" boxcars also used for food transport.\n\n==Refrigerator cars in Japan==\nThe first refrigerated cars in Japan entered service in 1908 for fish transport. Many of these cars were equipped with ice bunkers, however the bunkers were not used generally. Fish were packed in wooden or foam polystyrene boxes with crushed ice.\n\nFruit and meat transportation in refrigerated rail cars was not common in Japan. For fruits and vegetables, ventilator cars were sufficient due to the short distances involved in transportation. Meat required low temperature storage, transported by ship, since most major Japanese cities are located along the coast.\n\nRefrigerator cars suffered heavy damage in [[World War II]]. After the war, the occupation forces confiscated many cars for their own use, utilizing the ice bunkers as originally intended. Supplies were landed primarily at [[Yokohama]], and reefer trains ran from the port to U.S. bases around Japan.\n\nIn 1966, [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] developed \"resa 10000\" and \"remufu 10000\" type refrigerated cars that could travel at {{convert|62|mph|abbr=on}} They were used in fish freight express trains. \"Tobiuo\" ([[Flying fish]]) train from Shimonoseki to Tokyo, and \"Ginrin\" (Silver [[Scale (zoology)|scale]]) train from Hakata to Tokyo, were operated.\n\nBy the 1960s, refrigerator trucks had begun to displace railcars. Strikes in the 1970s resulted in the loss of reliability and punctuality, important to fish transportation. In 1986, the last refrigerated cars were replaced by reefer containers.\n\nMost Japanese reefers were four-wheeled due to small traffic demands. There were very few bogie wagons in late years. The total number of Japanese reefers numbered approximately 8,100. At their peak, about 5,000 refrigerated cars operated in the late 1960s. Mechanical refrigerators were tested, but did not see widespread use.\n\nThere were no privately owned reefers in Japan. This is because fish transportation was protected by national policies and rates were kept low, and there was little profit in refrigerated car ownership.\n\n==Refigerated trains in the United Kingdom==\n[[File:GWR wagon X7 77933.jpg|thumb|right|1925 GWR Mica A ice-chilled van as preserved at [[Didcot Railway Centre]]. Preserved as a Tevan used for non-refrigerated perishable traffic such as dried tea]]\nDue to the shorter distanse to be travelled in the [[United Kingdom]], the need for refrigeration was limited to specialised goods, which could in express-train format - mostly run overnight to avoid delays from passenger traffic - be transported in suitable timescales of less than a day from the area of production to processing, or onwards to the point of consumer consumption.\n\nHence whilst similar cattle, fish, fruit and farm-fresh produce shipping requirements existed, the need to refrigerate was often minimised by the use of non-stop express train service to the required destination. In example, the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]] ran specialised express trains from meat producer hubs in [[Scotland]] and the North of England to the [[Smithfield Market|Smithfield Meat Market]] in [[London]], with a dedicated goods station located below ground level directly into the market's slaughtering house. The LMS and the LNER also ran express fish trains from Fleetwood and Grimsby to [[Broad Street railway station (England)|Broad Street]] to access [[Billingsgate Market|Billingsgate Fish Market]].<ref>Title:LONDON MIDLAND & SCOTTISH|author=Bill Horsfall|page=79</ref>\n\nThe big four railway companies standardised within their own networks their own ice-chilled wagons, which being built with more insulation again minimised the need for onboard mechanical refrigeration. The [[Great Western Railway]] designed and built their own Mica A (ventilated) and Mica B (Non-vetilated) vans for such express produce trains, with ice supplied by the original product producer from their own plant.\n\nOne specialised form of fresh produce train which existed in the UK was the [[British railway milk trains|milk train]], which through use of specialised chilled glass-lined wagons remained in service until 1981.\n\nLike many railways around the world, modern UK railways do ship specialised refrigerated containers on intermodal trains, with such trains now taking-over the roll again from long-distance trucking on hub-to-hub routes to reduce carbon foot print. [[DB Cargo UK]] runs Europe's longest-distance single-operator handled train from [[Valencia]], [[Spain]] to [[Barking, London|Barking]] in [[East London]] twice weekly, in partnership with [[Eddie Stobart Logistics]] and retailler [[Tesco]]'s, shipping fresh fruit and produce 1,800&nbsp;km in refrigerated ISO containers.<ref>https://uk.dbcargo.com/resource/blob/1420568/b2e5cc755d75b8b7d947a61567bd1243/railways_032010-data.pdf</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n{{Further|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}\n*1842: The [[Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] experimented with innovative freight car designs capable of carrying all types of perishable goods without spoilage.\n*1851: The first refrigerated boxcar entered service on the [[Northern Railroad (New York)]].\n*1857: The first consignment of refrigerated, dressed beef traveled from Chicago to the East Coast in ordinary box cars packed with ice.\n*1866: Horticulturist [[Parker Earle]] shipped strawberries in iced boxes by rail from southern Illinois to Chicago on the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].\n*1867: First U.S. refrigerated railroad car patent was issued.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=FJgAAAAAEBAJ Improved Refrigerator Car].

[[Florida]] oranges were shipped to New York under refrigeration for the first time.\n*1889: The first cooled shipment of fruit from California was sold on the New York market.\n*1898: [[Russia|Russia's]] first refrigerator cars entered service. The country's inventory reached 1,900 by 1908, 3,000 two years later, and peaked at approximately 5,900 by 1916. The cars were utilized mainly for transporting butter from [[Siberia]] to the [[Baltic Sea]], a 12-day journey.\n*1899: Refrigerated fruit traffic within the U.S. reached {{convert|90000|ST|t LT|0}} per year; Transport from California to NY averaged 12 days in 1900.\n*1901: Carl von Linde equipped a Russian train with a mobile, central mechanical refrigeration plant to distribute cooling to cars carrying perishable goods.

The tight-fitting doors were better insulated and allowed the car to be maintained at a more even temperature. Early example is the DT&I XL-1 car by Evans.\n*1966: [[Japanese National Railways]] started operation of fish freight express trains by newly built \"resa 10000\" type refers.\n*1969: ACF constructed several experimental center flow hopper cars incorporating mechanical cooling systems and insulated cargo cells.

The cars did not come into general use until the early 20th century. Most units designed for express service are larger than their standard counterparts, and are typically constructed more along the lines of [[baggage car]]s than freight equipment. Cars must be equipped with speed-rated trucks and brakes, and&nbsp;\u2014 if they are to be run ahead of the passenger car, must also incorporate an air line for pneumatic braking, a communication signal air line, and a steam line for train heating. Express units were typically painted in passenger car colors, such as [[Pullman Company|Pullman]] green.\n\nThe first purpose-built express reefer emerged from the [[Erie Railroad]] Susquehanna Shops on August 1, 1886. By 1927, some 2,218 express cars traveled America's rails, and three years later that number rose to 3,264. In 1940, private rail lines began to build and operate their own reefers, the [[Railway Express Agency]] (REA) being by far the largest. In 1948, the REA roster (which would continue to expand into the 1950s) numbered approximately 1,800 cars, many of which were [[World War II]] \"[[troop sleeper]]s\" modified for express refrigerated transport. By 1965, due to a decline in refrigerated traffic, many express reefers were leased to railroads for use as bulk mail carriers.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Intermodal===\nFor many years, virtually all of the perishable traffic in the United States was carried by the railroads. While railroads were subject to government regulation regarding shipping rates, trucking companies could set their own rate for hauling agricultural products, giving them a competitive advantage. In March 1979, the [[Interstate Commerce Commission|ICC]] exempted rail transportation of fresh fruits and vegetables from all economic regulation. Once the \"Agricultural Exemption Clause\" was removed from the ''Interstate Commerce Act'', railroads began aggressively pursuing trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) business (a form of [[intermodal freight transport]]) for refrigerated trailers. Taking this one step further, a number of carriers (including the PFE and SFRD) purchased their own refrigerated trailers to compete with interstate trucks.\n\n===Tropicana \"Juice Train\"===\n{{Main|Juice Train}}\n[[File:TPIX 250.JPG|thumb|Former Tropicana refrigerator car]]\n\nIn 1970, Tropicana orange juice was shipped in bulk via [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] [[boxcars]] in one weekly round-trip from [[Bradenton, Florida]], to [[Kearny, New Jersey]]. By the following year, the company was operating two 60-car unit trains a week, each carrying around {{convert|1000000|gal|L impgal}} of juice. On June 7, 1971, the \"Great White Juice Train\" (the first unit train in the food industry, consisting of 150 {{convert|100|ST|t LT|adj=on}} insulated boxcars fabricated in the [[Alexandria, Virginia]], shops of [[Fruit Growers Express]]) commenced service over the {{convert|1250|mi|km}} route. An additional 100 cars were soon added, and small mechanical refrigeration units were installed to keep temperatures constant. Tropicana saved $40 million in fuel costs during the first ten years in operation.\n\n===Railex and other unit trains===\nIn 2006 [[Railex]] LLC launched service in partnership with the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] between [[Wallula, Washington]], and [[Rotterdam, New York]], followed in 2008 by a [[Delano, California]], to NY line, and [[Jacksonville, Florida]] service from the west coast in 2014.

Refrigerator cars differ from simple [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] boxcars and [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilated]] boxcars (commonly used for transporting [[fruit]]), neither of which are fitted with cooling apparatus. Reefers can be [[ice]]-[[Refrigeration|cooled]], come equipped with any one of a variety of mechanical refrigeration systems, or utilize [[carbon dioxide]] (either as [[dry ice]], or in liquid form) as a cooling agent. [[Milk car]]s (and other types of \"express\" reefers) may or may not include a cooling system, but are equipped with high-speed [[bogie|trucks]] and other modifications that allow them to travel with [[train|passenger trains]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background: North America===\n[[File:Illinois Central Railroad 14713.jpg|thumb|[[Illinois Central Railroad]] #14713, a ventilated fruit car dating from 1893]]\n\nAfter the end of the [[American Civil War]], [[Chicago, Illinois]] emerged as a major [[railway]] center for the [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of livestock raised on the [[Great Plains]] to Eastern markets.<ref>Boyle and Estrada</ref> Transporting the animals to market required herds to be driven up to {{convert|1200|mi|km}} to [[railhead]]s in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] or other locations in the midwest, such as Abilene and Dodge City, Kansas, where they were loaded into specialized [[Stock car (rail)|stock car]]s and [[transport]]ed live (\"on-the-hoof\") to regional processing centers. Driving cattle across the plains also caused tremendous weight loss, with some animals dying in transit.\n\nUpon arrival at the local processing facility, livestock were either [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]ed by wholesalers and delivered fresh to nearby butcher shops for retail sale, smoked, or packed for shipment in barrels of salt. Costly inefficiencies were inherent in transporting live animals by rail, particularly the fact that approximately 60% of the animal's mass is inedible.  The death of animals weakened by the long drive further increased the per-unit shipping cost. Meat processors sought a method to ship dressed meats from their Chicago packing plants to eastern markets.\n\n===Early attempts at refrigerated transport===\n[[File:Tiffany ad 1879 CBD.jpg|thumb|left|An advertisement taken from the 1st edition (1879) of the ''Car-Builders Dictionary'' for the '''Tiffany Refrigerator Car Company''', a pioneer in the design of refrigerated railroad cars]]\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, attempts were made to ship [[agriculture|agricultural]] products by rail. As early as 1842, the [[Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] was reported in the June 15 edition of the ''Boston Traveler'' to be experimenting with innovative [[freight car]] designs capable of carrying all types of perishable goods without spoilage.<ref>White, p. 31</ref> The first refrigerated boxcar entered service in June 1851, on the [[Northern Railroad (New York)]] (or NRNY, which later became part of the [[Rutland Railroad]]). This \"icebox on wheels\" was a limited success since it was only functional in cold weather. That same year, the [[Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad]] (O&LC) began shipping butter to Boston in purpose-built freight cars, utilizing ice for cooling.\n\n====Meat====\n{{anchor|meat|beef}}\nThe first consignment of dressed beef left the [[Union Stock Yards|Chicago stock yards]] in 1857 in ordinary [[boxcar]]s retrofitted with bins filled with ice. Placing meat directly against ice resulted in discoloration and affected the taste, proving to be impractical. During the same period [[Gustavus Franklin Swift|Gustavas Swift]] experimented by moving cut meat using a string of ten boxcars with their doors removed, and made a few test shipments to New York during the winter months over the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR). The method proved too limited to be practical.\n\n[[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit's]] William Davis patented a refrigerator car that employed metal racks to suspend the carcasses above a frozen mixture of ice and salt. In 1868, he sold the design  to [[George Hammond (industrialist)|George H. Hammond]], a Detroit meat packer, who built a set of cars to transport his products to Boston using ice from the [[Great Lakes]] for cooling.<ref>White, p. 33</ref> The load had the tendency of swinging to one side when the car entered a curve at high speed, and use of the units was discontinued after several derailments. In 1878 Swift hired engineer Andrew Chase to design a ventilated car that was well insulated, and positioned the ice in a compartment at the top of the car, allowing the chilled air to flow naturally downward.<ref>White, p. 45</ref> The meat was packed tightly at the bottom of the car to keep the [[center of gravity]] low and to prevent the cargo from shifting. Chase's design proved to be a practical solution, providing temperature-controlled carriage of dressed meats, This allowed [[Swift and Company]] to ship their products across the United States and internationally.\n\n{{anchor|Swift}}\nSwift's attempts to sell Chase's design to major railroads were rebuffed, as the companies feared that they would jeopardize their considerable investments in [[Stock car (rail)|stock cars]], animal pens, and feedlots if refrigerated meat transport gained wide acceptance. In response, Swift financed the initial production run on his own, then&nbsp;\u2014 when the American roads refused his business&nbsp;\u2014 he contracted with the GTR (a railroad that derived little income from transporting live cattle) to haul the cars into [[Michigan]] and then eastward through Canada. In 1880 the [[Peninsular Car Company]] (subsequently purchased by ACF) delivered the first of these units to Swift, and the Swift Refrigerator Line (SRL) was created.  Within a year, the Line's roster had risen to nearly 200 units, and Swift was transporting an average of 3,000 carcasses a week to [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Competing firms such as [[Armour and Company]] quickly followed suit. By 1920, the SRL owned and operated 7,000 of the ice-cooled rail cars. The [[General American Transportation Corporation]] would assume ownership of the line in 1930.\n\n[[File:Swift Refrigerator Line car, 1899.jpg|thumb|A [[builder's photo]] of one of the first refrigerator cars to come out of the [[Detroit]] plant of the [[American Car and Foundry Company]] (ACF), built for the [[Swift Refrigerator Line]] in 1899]]\n\n{{anchor|data}}\n'''Live cattle and dressed beef deliveries to New York ([[short ton]]s):'''\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n|\n|align=center | <small>''(Stock Cars)''</small>\n|align=center | <small>''(Refrigerator Cars)''</small>\n|-\n|align=center | &nbsp; '''Year &nbsp;'''\n|align=center | '''Live Cattle &nbsp;'''\n|align=center | '''Dressed Beef'''\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1882\n|align=center | 366,487\n|align=center | 2,633\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1883\n|align=center | 392,095\n|align=center | 16,365\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1884\n|align=center | 328,220\n|align=center | 34,956\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1885\n|align=center | 337,820\n|align=center | 53,344\n|-\n|&nbsp; 1886\n|align=center | 280,184\n|align=center | 69,769\n|}\n\n<small>The subject cars travelled on the [[Erie Railroad|Erie]], [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Lackawanna]], [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]], and [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]] railroads.</small>\n\n<small>Source: ''Railway Review'', January 29, 1887, p.&nbsp;62.</small>\n\n[[File:Early refrigerator car design circa 1870.jpg|thumb|A ''circa'' 1870 refrigerator car design.

His innovations created Georgia's fame for peaches, a crop now eclipsed economically by blueberries.<ref name=\"georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu\">[http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/gahistmarkers/samuelrumphhistmarker.htm]</ref><ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/ga-blueberry-knocks-peach-off-top-fruit-pile-153423288.html Ga. blueberry knocks peach off top of fruit pile, Associated Press, July 21, 2013, published by Yahoo News on-line, retrieved July 21, 2013]</ref>\n\n[[Edwin T. Earl|Edwin Tobias Earl]] was born on a fruit ranch near Red Bluff, California on May 30, 1858. His father was Joseph Earl, his mother Adelia Chaffee, and his brother was Guy Chaffee Earl. He started his career in the shipping of fruits. By 1886, he was President of the Earl Fruit Company. In 1890, he invented the refrigerator car to transport fruits to the East Coast of the United States. He established the Continental Fruit Express and invested US$2,000,000 in refrigerator cars. In 1901, he sold his refrigerator cars to Armour and Company of Chicago and became a millionaire.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, manufactured ice became more common. The [[Pacific Fruit Express]] (PFE) - a joint venture between the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] and [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroads, with a fleet of 6,600 refrigerator cars built by the [[American Car and Foundry Company]] (ACF)<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventory of the Pacific Fruit Express Company Collection, 1906-1989|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf7199n8cr/|publisher=Online Archive of California|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> - maintained seven natural harvesting facilities, and operated 18 artificial ice plants. Their largest plant (located in [[Roseville, California]]) produced {{convert|1200|ST|t|lk=on}} of ice daily, and Roseville's docks could accommodate up to 254 cars. At the industry's peak, {{convert|1300000|ST|t}} of ice was produced for refrigerator car use annually.\n\n====Ice====\n{{anchor|ice}}\nThe use of ice to refrigerate and preserve food dates back to prehistoric times. Through the ages, the [[Ice trade|seasonal harvesting]] of snow and ice was a regular practice of many cultures. China, [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] stored ice and snow in caves, dugouts or [[Ice house (building)|ice houses]] lined with straw or other insulating materials. Rationing of the ice allowed the preservation of foods during hot periods, a practice that was successfully employed for centuries. For most of the 19th century, natural ice (harvested from ponds and lakes) was used to supply refrigerator cars. At high altitudes or northern latitudes, one foot tanks were often filled with water and allowed to freeze. Ice was typically cut into blocks during the winter and stored in insulated warehouses for later use, with sawdust and hay packed around the ice blocks to provide additional insulation. A late-19th century wood-bodied reefer required re-icing every {{convert|250|mi|km}} to {{convert|400|mi|km}}.\n{{anchor|Top icing}}\nTop icing is the practice of placing a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} to {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} layer of crushed ice on top of agricultural products that have high respiration rates, need high relative humidity, and benefit from having the cooling agent sit directly atop the load (or within individual boxes). Cars with pre-cooled fresh produce were top iced just before shipment. Top icing added considerable dead weight to the load. Top-icing a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} reefer required in excess of {{convert|10000|lb|kg|lk=on}} of ice. It had been postulated that as the ice melts, the resulting chilled water would trickle down through the load to continue the cooling process. It was found, however, that top-icing only benefited the uppermost layers of the cargo, and that the water from the melting ice often passed through spaces between the cartons and pallets with little or no cooling effect. It was ultimately determined that top-icing is useful only in preventing an increase in temperature, and was eventually discontinued.\n\n<gallery class=center>\nFile:Ice Harvesting on Lake St Clair Michigan circa 1905--photograph courtesy Detroit Publishing Company.jpg|Men harvest ice on [[Michigan|Michigan's]] [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake Saint Clair]], ''circa'' 1905.

The use of similar \"billboard\" [[advertising]] on [[freight car]]s was banned by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] in 1937, and thereafter cars so decorated could no longer be accepted for interchange between roads\n</gallery>\n\n{{anchor|insulation}}\nRefrigerator cars required effective insulation to protect their contents from temperature extremes. \"[[felt|Hairfelt]]\" derived from compressed cattle hair, sandwiched into the floor and walls of the car, was inexpensive, yet flawed&nbsp; over its three- to four-year service life it would decay, rotting out the car's wooden partitions and tainting the cargo with a foul odor. The higher cost of other materials such as \"Linofelt\" (woven from [[flax]] fibers) or [[cork (material)|cork]] prevented their widespread adoption. Synthetic materials such as [[fiberglass]] and [[polystyrene]] foam, both introduced after [[World War II]], offered the most cost-effective and practical solution.\n\nThe United States Office of Defense Transportation implemented mandatory pooling of class RS produce refrigerator cars from 1941 through 1948. [[World War II]] experience found the cars spending 60 percent of their time traveling loaded, 30 percent traveling empty, and 10 percent idle; and indicated the average 14 loads each car carried per year included 5 requiring bunker icing, 1 requiring heating, and 8 using ventilation or top icing.<ref name=rmc>{{cite journal |last1=Lambert |first1=Dave |last2=Lambert |first2=Jenny |year=1994 |title=The post war refrigerator car -- a brief history: part I |journal=Railroad Model Craftsman |volume= |issue=March |pages=86\u201394 |publisher=Carstens Publications }}</ref>\n{{anchor|features}}\n\nFollowing experience with assorted car specifications, the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association (UFF&VA) listed what they considered the best features of ice refrigerator cars in 1948:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lambert |first1=Dave |last2=Lambert |first2=Jenny |year=1994 |title=The post war refrigerator car -- a brief history: part II |journal=Railroad Model Craftsman |volume= |issue=April |pages=86\u201393 |publisher=Carstens Publications }}</ref>\n* Steel cars (vs wood) for better insulation protection and greater rigidity resulting in reduced leakage around doors\n* A minimum of {{convert|4|in|cm}} insulation thickness with all insulation protected from moisture\n* Cushioned trucks and [[draft gear]] to minimize jarring and bruising of produce\n* Standardized interior dimensions to allow improved loading methods with standardized containers\n* Adjustable ice bunker bulkheads to allow greater floor space for shippers using top icing alone\n* Vertically adjustable grates within the ice bunkers to allow half-stage icing to reduce icing charges where appropriate\n* Forced air circulation within the car\n* An additional lining to allow side wall flues circulating air around all cargo preventing contact with exterior car walls\n* Perforated floor racks providing similar protection and air circulation under the cargo\n* Provisions for pre-cooling the cars with a portable unit at the loading platforms.\n\n===Mechanical refrigeration===\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, mechanical refrigeration began to replace ice-based systems. Soon after, mechanical refrigeration units replaced the \"armies\" of personnel required to re-ice the cars. The [[Bus doors#Sliding plug doors|sliding plug door]] was introduced experimentally by P.F.E. (Pacific Fruit Express) in April 1947, when one of their R-40-10 series cars, #42626, was equipped with one. P.F.E.'s R-40-26 series reefers, designed in 1949 and built in 1951, were the first production series cars to be so equipped. In addition, the Santa Fe Railroad first used plug doors on their SFRD RR-47 series cars, which were also built in 1951. This type of door provided a larger six foot opening to facilitate car loading and unloading. These tight-fitting doors were better insulated and could maintain an even temperature inside the car. By the mid-1970s, the few remaining ice bunker cars were relegated to \"top-ice\" service, where crushed ice was applied atop the commodity.\n\n===Cryogenic refrigeration===\nThe [[Topeka, Kansas]] shops of the Santa Fe Railway built five experimental refrigerator cars employing [[liquid nitrogen]] as the cooling agent in 1965. A mist induced by liquified nitrogen was released throughout the car if the temperature rose above a pre-determined level. Each car carried {{convert|3000|lb|kg}} of refrigerant and could maintain a temperature of minus 20 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (&minus;30&nbsp;\u00b0C). During the 1990s, a few railcar manufacturers experimented with the use of [[liquid carbon dioxide]] (CO<small><sub >2</sub></small>) as a cooling agent. The move was in response to rising fuel costs, and was an attempt to eliminate the standard mechanical refrigeration systems that required periodic maintenance. The CO<small><sub >2</sub></small> system can keep the cargo frozen solid as long as 14 to 16 days.\n\nSeveral hundred \"[[cryogenic]]\" refrigerator cars were placed in service transporting frozen foodstuffs, though they failed to gain wide acceptance (due, in part, to the rising cost of liquid carbon dioxide). Because cryogenic refrigeration is a proven technology and environmentally friendly, the rising price of fuel and the increased availability of carbon dioxide from [[Kyoto Protocol]]-induced capturing techniques may lead to a resurgence in cryogenic railcar usage.\n\n===Experimentation===\n\n====Aluminum and stainless steel====\nSeveral experimental cars were built when wartime production restrictions were relaxed in 1946:\n\n* [[Illinois Central Railroad]] number 51000 was built in the [[McComb, Mississippi]] <ref>http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/rspicture.aspx?id=64684</ref> shops with an aluminum superstructure to reduce weight with steel where required for strength and provided the standard dimensions, cushioned draft gear, easy-riding trucks, minimum {{convert|4|in|cm}} of insulation, adjustable ice bunker bulkheads and half-stage icing racks with forced air circulation through side wall flues and floor racks recommended by UFF&VA.<ref name=rmc/>\n* [[Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch]] number 13000 was built of [[stainless steel]] by the [[Consolidated Steel Corporation]] of [[Wilmington, California]] with convertible ice bunkers, side ventilation ducts, and axle-driven circulation fans. It was thought that stainless steel would better resist the corrosive deterioration resulting from salting the ice. The one-of-a-kind unit entered service as #13000, but was subsequently redesignated as #1300, and later given #4150 in 1955.<ref>Hendrickson and Scholz, p. 8</ref> The car spent most of its life in express service. Cost was cited as the reason no additional units were ordered. The car was dismantled at [[Clovis, New Mexico]] in February 1964.\n* Pacific Fruit Express rebuilt two steel-sided ventilator refrigerator cars in their [[Los Angeles]] shops with aluminum car bodies to test durability of lightweight alloys versus that of steel.<ref name=rmc/> It was hoped that weight savings (the units weighed almost {{convert|10000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} less than a like-sized all-steel car) and better corrosion resistance would offset the higher initial cost. [[Alcoa]] provided the body for number 44739, and [[Reynolds Metals|Reynolds Aluminum Company]] provided number 45698. The cars (outfitted with state-of-the-art fiberglass insulation and axle-driven fans for internal air circulation) traveled throughout the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific systems, where they were displayed to promote PFE's post-[[World War II]] modernization. Though both units remained in service over 15 years (#45698 was destroyed in a wreck in May 1962, while #44739 was scrapped in 1966), no additional aluminum reefers were constructed.\n* [[Fruit Growers Express]] number 38374 was equipped with an experimental aluminum body in the [[Indiana Harbor, Indiana]] shops.<ref name=rmc/>\n\n====\"Depression Baby\"====\nDuring the 1930s, the [[North American Car Company]] produced a one-of-a-kind, four-wheeled ice bunker reefer intended to serve the needs of specialized shippers who did not generate sufficient product to fill a full-sized refrigerator car. NADX #10000 was a {{convert|22|ft|m|2|adj=on}}<!-- rather short??? -->-long, all-steel car that resembled the [[forty-and-eights]] used in Europe during [[World War I]]. The prototype weighed {{convert|13.5|ST|t LT}} and was outfitted with a {{convert|1500|lb|abbr=on}} ice bunker at each end. The car was leased to [[Hormel]] and saw service between [[Chicago, Illinois]] and the southern United States. The concept failed to gain acceptance with eastern railroads and no additional units were built.\n\n====Dry ice====\nThe Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch (SFRD) briefly experimented with [[dry ice]] as a cooling agent in 1931. The compound was readily available and seemed like an ideal replacement for frozen water. Dry ice melts at {{convert|-109|\u00b0F|2|disp=or}} (versus {{convert|32|\u00b0F|disp=or}} for conventional ice) and was twice as effective thermodynamically. Overall weight was reduced as the need for brine and water was eliminated. While the higher cost of dry ice was certainly a drawback, logistical issues in loading long lines of cars efficiently prevented it from gaining acceptance over conventional ice. Worst of all, it was found that dry ice can adversely affect the color and flavor of certain foods if placed too closely to them.\n\n====Hopper cars====\nIn 1969, the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] ordered a number of modified [[covered hopper]] cars from [[American Car and Foundry]] for transporting perishable food in bulk. The {{convert|55|ft|m|2|adj=on}}-long  cars were blanketed with a layer of insulation, equipped with roof hatches for loading, and had centerflow openings along the bottom for fast discharge. A mechanical refrigeration unit was installed at each end of the car, where sheet metal ducting forced cool air into the cargo compartments.\n\nThe units, rated at {{convert|100|ST|t LT}} capacity (more than twice that of the largest conventional refrigerator car of the day) were economical to load and unload, as no secondary packaging was required. Apples, carrots, onions, and potatoes were transported in this manner with moderate success. Oranges, on the other hand, tended to burst under their own weight, even after wooden baffles were installed to better distribute the load. The Santa Fe Railway leased 100 of the hoppers from ACF, and in April 1972 purchased 100 new units, known as \"Conditionaire\" cars.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.kansasmemory.org/mobile/i/213800\n|title = Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe covered Hopper Conditionaire car\n|publisher = Kansas Historical Society\n|date =  2007\u20132012\n|accessdate = 2012-04-01}}</ref>\n\nThe cars' irregular, orange-colored outer surface (though darker than the standard AT&SF yellow-orange used on reefers) tended to collect dirt easily, and proved difficult to clean. Santa Fe eventually relegated the cars to more typical, non-refrigerated applications.\n\n===Preservation===\nExamples of many styles of refrigerator and ice cars can be found at railroad museums around the world.\n\nThe [[Western Pacific Railroad Museum]] at [[Portola, California]] features a very complete roster of 20th century cars, including wood bodied ice cars, steel bodied ice cars, one of the earliest mechanical refrigerator cars, later mechanical refrigerator cars and a cryogenic reefer, as well as several \"insulated\" boxcars also used for food transport.\n\n==Refrigerator cars in Japan==\nThe first refrigerated cars in Japan entered service in 1908 for fish transport. Many of these cars were equipped with ice bunkers, however the bunkers were not used generally. Fish were packed in wooden or foam polystyrene boxes with crushed ice.\n\nFruit and meat transportation in refrigerated rail cars was not common in Japan. For fruits and vegetables, ventilator cars were sufficient due to the short distances involved in transportation. Meat required low temperature storage, transported by ship, since most major Japanese cities are located along the coast.\n\nRefrigerator cars suffered heavy damage in [[World War II]]. After the war, the occupation forces confiscated many cars for their own use, utilizing the ice bunkers as originally intended. Supplies were landed primarily at [[Yokohama]], and reefer trains ran from the port to U.S. bases around Japan.\n\nIn 1966, [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] developed \"resa 10000\" and \"remufu 10000\" type refrigerated cars that could travel at {{convert|62|mph|abbr=on}} They were used in fish freight express trains. \"Tobiuo\" ([[Flying fish]]) train from Shimonoseki to Tokyo, and \"Ginrin\" (Silver [[Scale (zoology)|scale]]) train from Hakata to Tokyo, were operated.\n\nBy the 1960s, refrigerator trucks had begun to displace railcars. Strikes in the 1970s resulted in the loss of reliability and punctuality, important to fish transportation. In 1986, the last refrigerated cars were replaced by reefer containers.\n\nMost Japanese reefers were four-wheeled due to small traffic demands. There were very few bogie wagons in late years. The total number of Japanese reefers numbered approximately 8,100. At their peak, about 5,000 refrigerated cars operated in the late 1960s. Mechanical refrigerators were tested, but did not see widespread use.\n\nThere were no privately owned reefers in Japan. This is because fish transportation was protected by national policies and rates were kept low, and there was little profit in refrigerated car ownership.\n\n==Refigerated trains in the United Kingdom==\n[[File:GWR wagon X7 77933.jpg|thumb|right|1925 GWR Mica A ice-chilled van as preserved at [[Didcot Railway Centre]]. Preserved as a Tevan used for non-refrigerated perishable traffic such as dried tea]]\nDue to the shorter distanse to be travelled in the [[United Kingdom]], the need for refrigeration was limited to specialised goods, which could in express-train format - mostly run overnight to avoid delays from passenger traffic - be transported in suitable timescales of less than a day from the area of production to processing, or onwards to the point of consumer consumption.\n\nHence whilst similar cattle, fish, fruit and farm-fresh produce shipping requirements existed, the need to refrigerate was often minimalised by the use of non-stop express train service to the required destination. In example, the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]] ran specialised express trains from meat producer hubs in [[Scotland]] and the North of England to the [[Smithfield Market|Smithfield Meat Market]] in [[London]], with a dedicated goods station located below ground level directly into the market's slaughtering house. The LMS and the LNER also ran express fish trains from Fleetwood and Grimsby to [[Broad Street railway station (England)|Broad Street]] to access [[Billingsgate Market|Billingsgate Fish Market]].<ref>Title:LONDON MIDLAND & SCOTTISH|author=Bill Horsfall|page=79</ref>\n\nThe big four railway companies standardised within their own networks their own ice-chilled wagons, which being built with more insulation again minimised the need for onboard mechanical refrigeration. The [[Great Western Railway]] designed and built their own Mica A (ventilated) and Mica B (Non-vetilated) vans for such express produce trains, with ice supplied by the original product producer from their own plant.\n\nOne specialised form of fresh produce train which existed in the UK was the [[British railway milk trains|milk train]], which through use of specialised chilled glass-lined wagons remained in service until 1981.\n\nLike many railways around the world, modern UK railways do ship specialised refrigerated containers on intermodal trains, with such trains now taking-over the roll again from long-distance trucking on hub-to-hub routes to reduce carbon foot print. [[DB Cargo UK]] runs Europe's longest-distance single-operator handled train from [[Valencia]], [[Spain]] to [[Barking, London|Barking]] in [[East London]] twice weekly, in partnership with [[Eddie Stobart Logistics]] and retailler [[Tesco]]'s, shipping fresh fruit and produce 1,800&nbsp;km in refrigerated ISO containers.<ref>https://uk.dbcargo.com/resource/blob/1420568/b2e5cc755d75b8b7d947a61567bd1243/railways_032010-data.pdf</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n{{Further|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}\n*1842: The [[Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] experimented with innovative freight car designs capable of carrying all types of perishable goods without spoilage.\n*1851: The first refrigerated boxcar entered service on the [[Northern Railroad (New York)]].\n*1857: The first consignment of refrigerated, dressed beef traveled from Chicago to the East Coast in ordinary box cars packed with ice.\n*1866: Horticulturist [[Parker Earle]] shipped strawberries in iced boxes by rail from southern Illinois to Chicago on the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].\n*1867: First U.S. refrigerated railroad car patent was issued.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=FJgAAAAAEBAJ Improved Refrigerator Car].

The units were intended for shipment of bulk perishables.\n*1971: The last ice-cooled reefers were retired.\n*1980: The U.S. refrigerator car roster dropped to 80,000.\n*1986: The last reefers in Japan were replaced by [[Reefer (container)|reefer containers]].\n*1990s: The first cryogenically cooled reefers entered service.\n*2001: The number of refrigerator cars in the United States bottomed out at approximately 8,000.\n*2005: The number of reefers in the United States climbs to approximately 25,000, due to significant new refrigerator car orders.\n*2006 [[Railex]] launches 55-car unit train reefer service between U.S. west coast and New York.\n*2013 Additional unit train reefer services to Florida and Chicago are announced.\n\n==Specialized applications==\n\n===Express service===\nStandard refrigerated transport is often utilized for goods with less than 14 days of refrigerated \"shelf life\"&nbsp;\u2014  avocados, [[cut flowers]], green leafy vegetables, lettuce, mangoes, meat products, mushrooms, peaches and nectarines, pineapples and papayas, sweet cherries, and tomatoes. \"Express\" reefers are typically employed in the transport of special perishables: commodities with a refrigerated shelf life of less than seven days, such as human blood, fish, [[scallions|green onions]], milk, strawberries, and certain pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe earliest express-service refrigerator cars entered service around 1890, shortly after the first express train routes were established in North America. The cars did not come into general use until the early 20th century. Most units designed for express service are larger than their standard counterparts, and are typically constructed more along the lines of [[baggage car]]s than freight equipment. Cars must be equipped with speed-rated trucks and brakes, and&nbsp;\u2014 if they are to be run ahead of the passenger car, must also incorporate an air line for pneumatic braking, a communication signal air line, and a steam line for train heating. Express units were typically painted in passenger car colors, such as [[Pullman Company|Pullman]] green.\n\nThe first purpose-built express reefer emerged from the [[Erie Railroad]] Susquehanna Shops on August 1, 1886. By 1927, some 2,218 express cars traveled America's rails, and three years later that number rose to 3,264. In 1940, private rail lines began to build and operate their own reefers, the [[Railway Express Agency]] (REA) being by far the largest. In 1948, the REA roster (which would continue to expand into the 1950s) numbered approximately 1,800 cars, many of which were [[World War II]] \"[[troop sleeper]]s\" modified for express refrigerated transport. By 1965, due to a decline in refrigerated traffic, many express reefers were leased to railroads for use as bulk mail carriers.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Intermodal===\nFor many years, virtually all of the perishable traffic in the United States was carried by the railroads. While railroads were subject to government regulation regarding shipping rates, trucking companies could set their own rate for hauling agricultural products, giving them a competitive advantage. In March 1979, the [[Interstate Commerce Commission|ICC]] exempted rail transportation of fresh fruits and vegetables from all economic regulation. Once the \"Agricultural Exemption Clause\" was removed from the ''Interstate Commerce Act'', railroads began aggressively pursuing trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) business (a form of [[intermodal freight transport]]) for refrigerated trailers. Taking this one step further, a number of carriers (including the PFE and SFRD) purchased their own refrigerated trailers to compete with interstate trucks.\n\n===Tropicana \"Juice Train\"===\n{{Main|Juice Train}}\n[[File:TPIX 250.JPG|thumb|Former Tropicana refrigerator car]]\n\nIn 1970, Tropicana orange juice was shipped in bulk via [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] [[boxcars]] in one weekly round-trip from [[Bradenton, Florida]], to [[Kearny, New Jersey]]. By the following year, the company was operating two 60-car unit trains a week, each carrying around {{convert|1000000|gal|L impgal}} of juice. On June 7, 1971, the \"Great White Juice Train\" (the first unit train in the food industry, consisting of 150 {{convert|100|ST|t LT|adj=on}} insulated boxcars fabricated in the [[Alexandria, Virginia]], shops of [[Fruit Growers Express]]) commenced service over the {{convert|1250|mi|km}} route. An additional 100 cars were soon added, and small mechanical refrigeration units were installed to keep temperatures constant. Tropicana saved $40 million in fuel costs during the first ten years in operation.\n\n===Railex and other unit trains===\nIn 2006 [[Railex]] LLC launched service in partnership with the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] between [[Wallula, Washington]], and [[Rotterdam, New York]], followed in 2008 by a [[Delano, California]], to NY line, and [[Jacksonville, Florida]] service from the west coast in 2014.

It is one of the few musical instruments that still uses watch-key or [[Preston tuners]]. It is iconically associated with the musical genre known as [[Fado]], and is now an icon for anything Portuguese.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Port-guitar-silva-1796.jpg|thumb|Portuguese guitar]]\nThe Portuguese guitar now known has undergone considerable technical modification in the last century (dimensions, mechanical tuning system, etc.) although it has kept the same number of courses, the string tuning and the finger technique characteristic of this type of instrument.\n\nIt is a descendant of the [[Medieval]] [[citole]], based on evidence of its use in Portugal since the thirteenth century (then known as 'c\u00edtole' in Portuguese) amongst [[troubadour]] and minstrel circles and in the [[Renaissance]] period, although initially it was restricted to noblemen in court circles. Later it became popular and references have been found to [[citterns]] being played in the theater, in taverns and barbershops in the seventeenth and eighteenth century in particular.\n\nIn 1582, Friar Phillipe de Caverell visited Lisbon and described its customs; he mentions the Portuguese people\u2019s love for the [[cittern]] and other musical instruments. In 1649 was published the catalogue of the Royal Music Library of [[King John IV of Portugal]] containing the best known books of cittern music from foreign composers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which the complexity and technical difficulty of the pieces allow us to believe that there had been highly skilled players in Portugal.\n[[File:Jose malhoa fado.jpg|thumb|''Fado'', by [[Jos\u00e9 Malhoa]] (1910)]]\nThe angel playing the cittern (c.1680), a sculpture of large dimensions in the [[Alcoba\u00e7a Monastery]], depicts in detail the direct ancestor of the Portuguese guitar. In the first half of the eighteenth century, [[Ant\u00f3nio Nunes Ribeiro Sanches|Ribeiro Sanches]] (1699\u20131783) had cittern lessons in the town of [[Guarda, Portugal]], as he mentions in a letter from [[St. Petersburg]] in 1735.\n\nIn the same period there are other evidence to the use of the cittern alluding to a repertoire of sonatas, minuets, etc. shared with other instruments such as the harpsichord or the guitar.\nLater in the century (c. 1750), the so-called [[English guitar|English guittar]] made its appearance in Portugal. By 1786 those made by Simpson, an English luthier, became highly popular, and it was noted that he could also provide reliable nickel-silver strings. There was a type of cittern locally modified by German, English, Scottish and Dutch makers and enthusiastically greeted by the new mercantile bourgeoisie of the city of [[Porto]] who used it in the domestic context of [[Hausmusik]] practice. This consisted of the \"languid Modinhas\", the \"lingering Minuets\" and the \"risqu\u00e9 Lunduns\", as they were then called.<ref>See [http://imslp.org/wiki/Estudo_de_guitarra_%28Leite,_Ant%C3%B3nio_da_Silva%29 ''Estudo de Guitarra (...)''] by Ant\u00f3nio da Silva Leite (1759-1833) published in Oporto in 1796.</ref> The use of this type of guitar never became widespread. It disappeared in the second half of the nineteenth century when the popular version of the cittern came into fashion again by its association with the Lisbon song (''fado'') accompaniment. \n\nThe last detailed reference to the c\u00edtara appeared in 1858 in J.F. F\u00e8tis' book ''The Music Made Easy''. The Portuguese translation includes a glossary describing the various characteristics (tunings, social status, repertoire, etc.) of both cittern and \"English\" guitar of the time.\n\nGradually the Simpson design was transformed by Portuguese luthiers, with a wider body, longer scale length, and a wider fingerboard, made more manageable by using a large radius, rather than a flat fingerboard.\n\nThe Portuguese guitar is used for solo music (''guitarradas'') as well as the accompaniment, which it shares with a steel strung classical guitar (''viola de fado'') and occasional double bass or guitar-bass,  and its wide repertoire is often presented in concert halls and in the context of classical and world music festivals all around the world.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/6020994/The_Portuguese_Guitar_History_and_Transformation_of_an_Instrument_Associated_with_Fado%7C|title=The Portuguese Guitar: History and Transformation of an Instrument Associated with Fado|first=Nuno|last=Cristo|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\nThere are two distinct Portuguese guitar models: the [[Lisbon|Lisboa]] and the [[Coimbra]].\n\nThe differences between the two models are the scale length (445&nbsp;mm of free string length in Lisboa guitars and 470&nbsp;mm in Coimbra guitars), body measurements, and other finer construction details. Overall, the Coimbra model is of simpler construction than the Lisboa model. Visually and most distinctively, the Lisboa model can easily be differentiated from the Coimbra model by its larger soundboard and the scroll ornament (''caracois -'' snail) that usually adorns the tuning machine, in place of Coimbra's teardrop-shaped (''lagrima'') motif. Lisboa guitars usually employ a narrower neck profile as well. Both models have a very distinct timbre, the Lisboa model having a more bright and resonant sound, and the choice between the both of them falls upon each player's preferences.\n\nAs early as 1905 [[luthiers]] were building larger Portuguese guitars (called ''guitarr\u00e3o'', the plural being ''guitarr\u00f5es''), seemingly in very small numbers and with limited success. Recently, the famed luthier Gilberto Gr\u00e1cio has built a ''guitarr\u00e3o'', which he named a ''[[guitol\u00e3o]]'' instead; this instrument which allows for a wider timbric range, on the low and the high end, than a regular Portuguese guitar.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fernandezmusic.com/PortugueseGuitarMethod.html|title=Portuguese Guitar Method|website=www.fernandezmusic.com}}</ref>\n\n==Technique==\nThe techniques employed to play the Portuguese guitar are what are historically called ''figueta'' and ''dedilho''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fernandezmusic.com/Portuguesemethodpage2.html|title=Portuguesemethodpage2|website=www.fernandezmusic.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> ''Figueta'' technique comprises playing solely with the thumb and the index fingers and it was inspired by the technique used to play [[Viola_da_terra|Viola da Terra]].  ''Dedilho'' technique concentrates on up and down strokes of the index finger to play complex passages.  On the Portuguese guitar the strings are picked with the corner of the fingernails, avoiding contact of the flesh with the strings. The unused fingers of the picking hand rest below the strings, on the ''guarda-unhas'' on the soundboard. Most players use various materials in place of natural fingernails; these fingerpicks (''unhas'') were traditionally made of tortoiseshell, but today are usually nylon or plastic.  While Lisbon ''unhas'' are commonly rectangular shaped for a clearer attack, Coimbra ''unhas'' tend to follow the natural curve of the fingernail.\n\nTechnique basics are the ''fado maior, fado menor'' and ''fado Mouraria''. Then one masters the ''trinado'' (a triplet ornament), slides, picking individual strings (instead of both in a course), and intense characteristic vibrato to embellish the melody. Finally, in addition to the ''fados'', there are traditional virtuosic pieces\u2014the ''fado Lopes'', and ''Varia\u00e7oes'' em ''Re Menor'', ''La Menor'', ''Mi Menor'' and ''Si Menor.''\n\nA good ''guitarrista'' should know at least a hundred of the over two hundred standard ''fados''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Antonio|first=Parreira|title=\"O livro dos fados -- 180 Fados Tradicionais em partituras\"|publisher=Museu de Fado|year=2014|isbn=978-989-96629-9-5|location=Lisbon|pages=}}</ref> in any key requested by the ''fadista''.\n\n=== Lisboa ===\nThe Lisboa style of playing traditionally utilizes the Guitarra de Lisboa, but today it is increasingly more common to see musicians with Guitarra de Coimbra tuned tighter to accommodate the Lisboa tuning.<ref name=\":0\" />  In accompanying Lisbon Fado the ''guitarrista'' plays the introduction, traditionally based on the second half of the vocal melody, then alternates between the techniques described above and short expressive phrases answering the ''fadista's'' phrases in a musical call-and-response. In faster ''fados'' the ''guitarra'' often improvises virtuosically throughout, including soloing over the ''fadista's'' singing.\n\n=== Coimbra ===\nThe Coimbra style of playing, popularized by [[Artur Paredes|Artur]] and [[Carlos Paredes]], originates with the university students from the historic [[University of Coimbra|Universidade de Coimbra]].  The male students and graduates would traditionally play a [[Coimbra Fado]] at night or ''serenata'' (serenade) for a woman to be courted.\n\nInstead of bridging the gap between a singer's phrases, in Coimbra Fado, the ''guitarra'' plays the chordal accompaniment alongside the Acoustic guitar.  As opposed to the rapid, more technically challenging Lisbon Fado, the ''guitarrista'' plays a downstroke with the thumb followed by a rolled chord across all the strings which ends with the index finger crossed in front of the thumb.  This pattern is easily modified to fit the time signature of the specific Coimbra Fado being played.\n\n==Notable artists==\n[[File:Antonio Chainho.jpg|thumb|200px|Ant\u00f3nio Chainho and his Portuguese guitar (Lisbon model)]]\n\n[[Armandinho (fado guitarist)|Armandinho]], born in 1891, became one of the most influential guitar players in Lisbon, leaving a vast repertoire of variations and ''fados'' behind. Following in his footsteps came other guitarists, such as [[Jaime Santos]], Raul Nery, Jos\u00e9 Nunes, Carlos Gon\u00e7alves and [[Fontes Rocha]]. [[Artur Paredes]], born in 1899, was an equally important player in the city of Coimbra.  Many of today's Coimbra guitar features can be traced back to his contact with local luthiers.  His son [[Carlos Paredes]] was a virtuoso and attained great popularity, becoming the most internationally known Portuguese guitar player.  His compositions on the Portuguese guitar go beyond the traditional use of the instrument in ''fado'' musicianship giving him (and the instrument) a status above folk or regional music. This soloistic tradition has been followed till today by several outstanding musicians such as Pedro Caldeira Cabral, Antonio Chainho, Ricardo Rocha, Paulo Soares, and several other virtuoso guitarists of the younger generation. The first concerto for Portuguese guitar and orchestra in history was composed and premiered by Pedro Henriques da Silva on December 5th, 2017 with the Orchestra of the Swan at Stratford ArtsHouse in Stratford-upon-Avon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planethugill.com/2017/12/concerto-first-pedro-da-silva-oots.html|title=Concerto first: Pedro Da Silva & OOTS premiere work for Portuguese guitar|website=www.planethugill.com}}</ref>.\n\nMany leading ''guitarristas'' in Lisboa\u2014Mario Pacheco, Luis Guerreiro, Jose Manuel Neto, Henrique Leit\u00e3o, Bruno Chaveiro, Paulo de Castro, Ricardo Martins and Custodio Castelo - now use Oscar Cardoso ''guitarras'', which feature the extraordinary innovation of a cutaway in the back of the ''guitarra'', and a Coimbra string length but with Lisboa tuning. The virtuosity of these artists has changed the sound of ''fado'' radically, and their speed is extraordinary. Rocha has composed highly avant-garde pieces, and the original ''guitarradas'' of Pacheco, Castelo and Martins have become common repertoire in Lisboa, as those of Soares have become in Coimbra. Most advanced players will learn some of Carlos Paredes' difficult works. Marta Pereira Da Costa has achieved prominence as the first female virtuoso ''guitarrista.''\n\n===Outside Portuguese music===\nThe Portuguese guitar played a small role in Celtic and western folk music following the folk revival.

The Gr\u00e1cio family and \u00c1lvaro Ferreira's instruments are usually considered as the pinnacle in terms of quality, although these instruments are very hard to find and can be quite expensive. \n\nAntonio Pinto de Carvalho's APC luthiery is one of the largest in Europe, and produces thousands of traditional Portuguese stringed instruments. \n\n==Tuning==\n[[File:LisboaTuning.png|thumb|Afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Lisboa (Lisboa tuning)]]\n[[File:CoimbraTuning.png|thumb|Afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Coimbra (Coimbra tuning)]]\n[[File:NaturalTuning.png|thumb|Afina\u00e7\u00e3o natural (Natural tuning)]]\n\nThe tuning chiefly employed on the Portuguese guitar was historically called ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o do fado'' or ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o do fado corrido''. It was probably developed in the early 19th century, as it was already largely adopted by Lisbon's ''fadistas'' by the mid-century. With the diminishing use of the natural tuning (see below) by players, this tuning came to simply be called either ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Lisboa'', when tuned high, in D, or ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Coimbra'', when tuned low, in C; this stems from the fact that while most Lisbon Fado players tuned their guitars in D, in Coimbra the students came to tune theirs in C as standard practice, mainly through the influence of Artur Paredes. It is important to note, however, that regardless of the difference in pitch between the two variations of the tuning, in practice, the latter still makes use of the former's aural conventions, as such a ''do/''C is called ''re/''D, a D is called ''mi/''E, etc., by the players (essentially making a Coimbra-tuned Portuguese guitar a [[transposing instrument]] similar to a B-flat trumpet in that a given note is referred to by the note name a whole step higher than the note name that [[Concert pitch|concert-pitch]] conventions would use).\n\nThe natural tuning, inherited from the [[English guitar|English guittar]] of the 18th century, was also very frequently employed up to the first half of the 20th century, being preferred to the former by some late-19th-century players; it was frequently tuned in E instead of C, as this simplified the change between the ''fado'' tuning for players who used both. Some variations of this tuning were also adopted, such as the ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o natural com 4\u00aa'', also known as ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o da Mouraria'', or the ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Jo\u00e3o de Deus'', also known as ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o natural menor''. The natural tuning and its variations have been for the most part, out of practice for several decades.\n\n== Notation ==\nThe Portuguese guitar can read Portuguese guitar tablature, sheet music in treble, or a combination of both.  The ''dedilho'' technique is notated with up and down arrows over multiple notes corresponding to a downstroke or upstroke of the index finger.  An \"i\" is used to indicate a stroke with the index finger, or ''indicador'', and a \"p\" is used for the thumb, or ''pulgar''.  The middle finger is rarely used but notated with an \"m\" for ''m\u00e9dio''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Soares|first=Paulo|title=M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa|publisher=Paulo Soares|year=1997|isbn=|location=Coimbra|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWhile one can find many virtuosic Coimbra pieces written out as sheet music, ''fados'' are generally improvised and require no music for a good ''guitarrista'' to play.  The chord progression to each specific ''fado'' should be understood by the good ''guitarrista''.  While this skill has traditionally been acquired by younger players playing alongside a more advanced ''guitarrista'' in an ensemble, it was only in the early 2000s that the first ''fado'' school had been established to formally teach the improvisational style alongside the written version.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Anaia Cristo|first=Nuno Jos\u00e9 dos Santos|date=JANUARY 2014|title=THE PORTUGUESE GUITAR:\nHISTORY AND TRANSFORMATION OF AN INSTRUMENT ASSOCIATED WITH FADO|url=yorkspace.library.yorku.ca|journal=A THESIS SUBMITTED TO\nTHE FACULTY OF GRADUATE STUDIES\nIN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF\nMASTER OF ARTS|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n | title = A Guitarra Portuguesa,\n | first = Pedro\n | last = Caldeira Cabral\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Ediclube\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 972-719-077-4\n}} &mdash; THE PORTUGUESE GUITAR\n* {{cite book\n | title = The Portuguese Guitar Chord Bible: Lisboa Tuning 1,728 Chords\n | first = Tobe A.\n | last = Richards\n | location = United Kingdom\n | publisher = Cabot Books\n | year = 2009\n | isbn = 978-1-906207-13-7\n}} &mdash; A comprehensive chord dictionary for the Portuguese Lisboa Guitar\n* {{cite book\n | title = M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa Vol. 1: Bases para a Guitarra de Coimbra\n | first = Paulo\n | last = Soares\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Paulo Soares\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 972-97496-0-4\n}} &mdash; Basic techniques for the Portuguese Coimbra Guitar {{in lang|pt}}\n* {{cite book\n | title = M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa, Vol. 2: Dom\u00ednio dos Acordes\n | first = Paulo\n | last = Soares\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Paulo Soares\n | year = 2007\n | isbn = 978-972-97496-1-2\n}} &mdash; Chord building {{in lang|pt}}\n* {{cite book\n | title = Guitarra Magica Fado\n | first = Eurico Augusto\n | last = Cebolo\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Unknown\n | isbn = 972-8019-07-6\n}} &mdash; Basic techniques for the Portuguese Coimbra Guitar {{in lang|pt}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bandolim]]\n*[[Viola braguesa]]\n*[[Rabeca]]\n*[[Gaita transmontana]]\n*[[Cavaquinho]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110926110703/http://www.musinaction.pt/media/site_docs/pdf_67_16928_PGAcoustics_-_Part_1.pdf Acoustic analysis of Portuguese guitars] <sup>(Retrieved on 24-09-2013)</sup>\n* [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.vu.carlosfernandes.guitarraportuguesa Portuguese Guitar for Android]\n{{Guitars}}\n\n{{Portugal topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Portuguese Guitar}}\n[[Category:Fado]]\n[[Category:Guitars]]\n[[Category:Portuguese musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Necked box lutes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox instrument\n|name=Portuguese Guitar<br/>''Guitarra Portuguesa''\n|names=\n|image=2 Portuguese guitars.jpg\n|image_capt=Left: Coimbra guitar; right: Lisbon guitar\n|background=string\n|classification=[[String instrument]] \n|hornbostel_sachs=\n|hornbostel_sachs_desc=\n|range= \n|related= [[Guitar]] - [[Cittern]]\n|articles=\n}}\n\nThe '''Portuguese guitar''' or '''Portuguese guitarra''' ({{lang-pt|'''guitarra portuguesa'''}}, {{IPA-pt|\u0261i\u02c8ta\u0281\u0250 pu\u027etu\u02c8\u0263ez\u0250|pron}}) is a plucked string instrument with twelve steel strings, strung in six [[course (music)|courses]] of two strings. It is one of the few musical instruments that still uses watch-key or [[Preston tuners]]. It is iconically associated with the musical genre known as [[Fado]], and is now an icon for anything Portuguese.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Port-guitar-silva-1796.jpg|thumb|Portuguese guitar]]\nThe Portuguese guitar now known has undergone considerable technical modification in the last century (dimensions, mechanical tuning system, etc.) although it has kept the same number of courses, the string tuning and the finger technique characteristic of this type of instrument.\n\nIt is a descendant of the [[Medieval]] [[citole]], based on evidence of its use in Portugal since the thirteenth century (then known as 'c\u00edtole' in Portuguese) amongst [[troubadour]] and minstrel circles and in the [[Renaissance]] period, although initially it was restricted to noblemen in court circles. Later it became popular and references have been found to [[citterns]] being played in the theater, in taverns and barbershops in the seventeenth and eighteenth century in particular.\n\nIn 1582, Friar Phillipe de Caverell visited Lisbon and described its customs; he mentions the Portuguese people\u2019s love for the [[cittern]] and other musical instruments. In 1649 was published the catalogue of the Royal Music Library of [[King John IV of Portugal]] containing the best known books of cittern music from foreign composers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which the complexity and technical difficulty of the pieces allow us to believe that there had been highly skilled players in Portugal.\n[[File:Jose malhoa fado.jpg|thumb|''Fado'', by [[Jos\u00e9 Malhoa]] (1910)]]\nThe angel playing the cittern (c.1680), a sculpture of large dimensions in the [[Alcoba\u00e7a Monastery]], depicts in detail the direct ancestor of the Portuguese guitar. In the first half of the eighteenth century, [[Ant\u00f3nio Nunes Ribeiro Sanches|Ribeiro Sanches]] (1699\u20131783) had cittern lessons in the town of [[Guarda, Portugal]], as he mentions in a letter from [[St. Petersburg]] in 1735.\n\nIn the same period there are other evidence to the use of the cittern alluding to a repertoire of sonatas, minuets, etc. shared with other instruments such as the harpsichord or the guitar.\nLater in the century (c. 1750), the so-called [[English guitar|English guittar]] made its appearance in Portugal. By 1786 those made by Simpson, an English luthier, became highly popular, and it was noted that he could also provide reliable nickel-silver strings. There was a type of cittern locally modified by German, English, Scottish and Dutch makers and enthusiastically greeted by the new mercantile bourgeoisie of the city of [[Porto]] who used it in the domestic context of [[Hausmusik]] practice. This consisted of the \"languid Modinhas\", the \"lingering Minuets\" and the \"risqu\u00e9 Lunduns\", as they were then called.<ref>See [http://imslp.org/wiki/Estudo_de_guitarra_%28Leite,_Ant%C3%B3nio_da_Silva%29 ''Estudo de Guitarra (...)''] by Ant\u00f3nio da Silva Leite (1759-1833) published in Oporto in 1796.</ref> The use of this type of guitar never became widespread. It disappeared in the second half of the nineteenth century when the popular version of the cittern came into fashion again by its association with the Lisbon song (''fado'') accompaniment. \n\nThe last detailed reference to the c\u00edtara appeared in 1858 in J.F. F\u00e8tis' book ''The Music Made Easy''. The Portuguese translation includes a glossary describing the various characteristics (tunings, social status, repertoire, etc.) of both cittern and \"English\" guitar of the time.\n\nGradually the Simpson design was transformed by Portuguese luthiers, with a wider body, longer scale length, and a wider fingerboard, made more manageable by using a large radius, rather than a flat fingerboard.\n\nThe Portuguese guitar is used for solo music (''guitarradas'') as well as the accompaniment, which it shares with a steel strung classical guitar (''viola de fado'') and occasional double bass or guitar-bass,  and its wide repertoire is often presented in concert halls and in the context of classical and world music festivals all around the world.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/6020994/The_Portuguese_Guitar_History_and_Transformation_of_an_Instrument_Associated_with_Fado%7C|title=The Portuguese Guitar: History and Transformation of an Instrument Associated with Fado|first=Nuno|last=Cristo|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\nThere are two distinct Portuguese guitar models: the [[Lisbon|Lisboa]] and the [[Coimbra]].\n\nThe differences between the two models are the scale length (445&nbsp;mm of free string length in Lisboa guitars and 470&nbsp;mm in Coimbra guitars), body measurements, and other finer construction details. Overall, the Coimbra model is of simpler construction than the Lisboa model. Visually and most distinctively, the Lisboa model can easily be differentiated from the Coimbra model by its larger soundboard and the scroll ornament (''caracois -'' snail) that usually adorns the tuning machine, in place of Coimbra's teardrop-shaped (''lagrima'') motif. Lisboa guitars usually employ a narrower neck profile as well. Both models have a very distinct timbre, the Lisboa model having a more bright and resonant sound, and the choice between the both of them falls upon each player's preferences.\n\nAs early as 1905 [[luthiers]] were building larger Portuguese guitars (called ''guitarr\u00e3o'', the plural being ''guitarr\u00f5es''), seemingly in very small numbers and with limited success. Recently, the famed luthier Gilberto Gr\u00e1cio has built a ''guitarr\u00e3o'', which he named a ''[[guitol\u00e3o]]'' instead; this instrument which allows for a wider timbric range, on the low and the high end, than a regular Portuguese guitar.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fernandezmusic.com/PortugueseGuitarMethod.html|title=Portuguese Guitar Method|website=www.fernandezmusic.com}}</ref>\n\n==Technique==\nThe techniques employed to play the Portuguese guitar are what are historically called ''figueta'' and ''dedilho''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fernandezmusic.com/Portuguesemethodpage2.html|title=Portuguesemethodpage2|website=www.fernandezmusic.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> ''Figueta'' technique comprises playing solely with the thumb and the index fingers and it was inspired by the technique used to play [[Viola_da_terra|Viola da Terra]].  ''Dedilho'' technique concentrates on up and down strokes of the index finger to play complex passages.  On the Portuguese guitar the strings are picked with the corner of the fingernails, avoiding contact of the flesh with the strings. The unused fingers of the picking hand rest below the strings, on the ''guarda-unhas'' on the soundboard. Most players use various materials in place of natural fingernails; these fingerpicks (''unhas'') were traditionally made of tortoiseshell, but today are usually nylon or plastic.  While Lisbon ''unhas'' are commonly rectangular shaped for a clearer attack, Coimbra ''unhas'' tend to follow the natural curve of the fingernail.\n\n=== Lisboa ===\nThe Lisboa style of playing traditionally utilizes the Guitarra de Lisboa, but today it is increasingly more common to see musicians with Guitarra de Coimbra tuned tighter to accommodate the Lisboa tuning.<ref name=\":0\" />  In accompanying Lisbon Fado the ''guitarrista'' plays the introduction, traditionally based on the second half of the vocal melody, then alternates between the techniques described above and short expressive phrases answering the faddist's phrases in a musical call-and-response. In faster fados the guitarra often improvises virtuosically throughout, including soloing over the fadista's singing.\n\nTechnique basics are the ''fado maior, fado menor'' and ''fado Mouraria''. Then one masters the ''trinado'' (plucking forward and backward with the index nail or plastic ''unha'')'', and appogiaturas''  and trills to embellish the ''dedilhos''. Then there are traditional virtuosic pieces\u2014the fado Lopes, and ''Varia\u00e7oes'' in Dm, Am, Em and Bm.\n\nA good guitarrista should know at least a hundred of the over two hundred standard fados<ref>{{Cite book|last=Antonio|first=Parreira|title=\"O livro dos fados -- 180 Fados Tradicionais em partituras\"|publisher=Museu de Fado|year=2014|isbn=978-989-96629-9-5|location=Lisbon|pages=}}</ref> in any key requested by the fadista.\n\n=== Coimbra ===\nThe Coimbra style of playing, popularized by [[Artur Paredes|Artur]] and [[Carlos Paredes]], originates with the university students from the historic [[University of Coimbra|Universidade de Coimbra]].  The male students and graduates would traditionally play a Coimbra Fado at night or ''serenata'' (serenade) for a woman to be courted.\n\nInstead of bridging the gap between a singer's phrases, in Coimbra Fado, the Guitarra plays the chordal accompaniment alongside the Acoustic guitar.  As opposed to the rapid, more technically challenging Lisbon Fado, the ''guitarrista'' player plays a downstroke with the thumb followed by a rolled chord across all the strings which ends with the index finger crossed in front of the thumb.  This pattern is easily modified to fit the time signature of the specific Coimbra Fado being played.\n\n==Notable artists==\n[[File:Antonio Chainho.jpg|thumb|200px|Ant\u00f3nio Chainho and his Portuguese guitar (Lisbon model)]]\n\n[[Armandinho (fado guitarist)|Armandinho]], born in 1891, became one of the most influential guitar players in Lisbon, leaving a vast repertoire of variations and fados behind. Following in his footsteps came other guitarists, such as [[Jaime Santos]], Raul Nery, Jos\u00e9 Nunes, Carlos Gon\u00e7alves and [[Fontes Rocha]]. [[Artur Paredes]], born in 1899, was an equally important player in the city of Coimbra.  Many of today's Coimbra guitar features can be traced back to his contact with local luthiers.  His son [[Carlos Paredes]] was a virtuoso and attained great popularity, becoming the most internationally known Portuguese guitar player.  His compositions on the Portuguese guitar go beyond the traditional use of the instrument in ''fado'' musicianship giving him (and the instrument) a status above folk or regional music. This soloistic tradition has been followed till today by several outstanding musicians such as Pedro Caldeira Cabral, Antonio Chainho, Ricardo Rocha, Paulo Soares, and several other virtuoso guitarists of the younger generation. The first concerto for Portuguese guitar and orchestra in history was composed and premiered by Pedro Henriques da Silva on December 5th, 2017 with the Orchestra of the Swan at Stratford ArtsHouse in Stratford-upon-Avon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planethugill.com/2017/12/concerto-first-pedro-da-silva-oots.html|title=Concerto first: Pedro Da Silva & OOTS premiere work for Portuguese guitar|website=www.planethugill.com}}</ref>.\n\nMany leading guitarristas in Lisboa\u2014Mario Pacheco, Luis Guerreiro, Jose Manuel Neto, Henrique Leit\u00e3o, Bruno Chaveiro, Paulo de Castro, Ricardo Martins and Custodio Castelo - now use Oscar Cardoso guitarras, which feature the extraordinary innovation of a cutaway in the back of the guitarra, and a Coimbra string length but with Lisboa tuning. The virtuosity of these artists has changed the sound of ''fado'' radically, and their speed is extraordinary. Rocha has composed highly avant-garde pieces, and the original ''guitarradas'' of Pacheco, Castelo and Martins have become common repertoire in Lisboa, as those of Soares have become in Coimbra. Most advanced players will learn some of Carlos Paredes' difficult works. Marta Pereira Da Costa has achieved prominence as the first female virtuoso ''guitarrista.''\n\n===Outside Portuguese music===\nThe Portuguese guitar played a small role in Celtic and western folk music following the folk revival.

The middle finger is rarely used but notated with an \"m\" for ''m\u00e9dio''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Soares|first=Paulo|title=M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa|publisher=Paulo Soares|year=1997|isbn=|location=Coimbra|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWhile one can find many virtuosic Coimbra pieces written out as sheet music, fados are generally improvised and require no music for a good ''guitarrista'' to play.  The chord progression to each specific fado should be understood by the good ''guitarrista''.  While this skill has traditionally been acquired by younger players playing alongside a more advanced ''guitarrista'' in an ensemble, it was only in the early 2000s that the first Fado school had been established to formally teach the improvisational style alongside the written version.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Anaia Cristo|first=Nuno Jos\u00e9 dos Santos|date=JANUARY 2014|title=THE PORTUGUESE GUITAR:\nHISTORY AND TRANSFORMATION OF AN INSTRUMENT ASSOCIATED WITH FADO|url=yorkspace.library.yorku.ca|journal=A THESIS SUBMITTED TO\nTHE FACULTY OF GRADUATE STUDIES\nIN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF\nMASTER OF ARTS|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n | title = A Guitarra Portuguesa,\n | first = Pedro\n | last = Caldeira Cabral\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Ediclube\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 972-719-077-4\n}} &mdash; THE PORTUGUESE GUITAR\n* {{cite book\n | title = The Portuguese Guitar Chord Bible: Lisboa Tuning 1,728 Chords\n | first = Tobe A.\n | last = Richards\n | location = United Kingdom\n | publisher = Cabot Books\n | year = 2009\n | isbn = 978-1-906207-13-7\n}} &mdash; A comprehensive chord dictionary for the Portuguese Lisboa Guitar\n* {{cite book\n | title = M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa Vol. 1: Bases para a Guitarra de Coimbra\n | first = Paulo\n | last = Soares\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Paulo Soares\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 972-97496-0-4\n}} &mdash; Basic techniques for the Portuguese Coimbra Guitar {{in lang|pt}}\n* {{cite book\n | title = M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa, Vol. 2: Dom\u00ednio dos Acordes\n | first = Paulo\n | last = Soares\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Paulo Soares\n | year = 2007\n | isbn = 978-972-97496-1-2\n}} &mdash; Chord building {{in lang|pt}}\n* {{cite book\n | title = Guitarra Magica Fado\n | first = Eurico Augusto\n | last = Cebolo\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Unknown\n | isbn = 972-8019-07-6\n}} &mdash; Basic techniques for the Portuguese Coimbra Guitar {{in lang|pt}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bandolim]]\n*[[Viola braguesa]]\n*[[Rabeca]]\n*[[Gaita transmontana]]\n*[[Cavaquinho]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110926110703/http://www.musinaction.pt/media/site_docs/pdf_67_16928_PGAcoustics_-_Part_1.pdf Acoustic analysis of Portuguese guitars] <sup>(Retrieved on 24-09-2013)</sup>\n* [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.vu.carlosfernandes.guitarraportuguesa Portuguese Guitar for Android]\n{{Guitars}}\n\n{{Portugal topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Portuguese Guitar}}\n[[Category:Fado]]\n[[Category:Guitars]]\n[[Category:Portuguese musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Necked box lutes]]\n", "name_user": "Ufoshowlloao", "label": "safe", "comment": "italicized Portuguese terms", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_guitar"}

The toys are enjoyed by a wide variety of age groups and are similar to many other small plush toys; however, each Webkinz toy has an attached tag with a unique \"Secret Code\" printed on it that allows you to play with your pet in the \"Webkinz World\" [[website]]. On Webkinz World, the Secret Code allows the user to own a [[digital pet|virtual version]] of the pet for online play. Lil' Kinz are smaller, less expensive versions of Webkinz, while the Signature collection is larger, higher-quality, and slightly more expensive. Sales of plush Webkinz toys are limited to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], but international users can buy virtual pets from the online eStore.<ref name=\"Webkinz eStore\">[http://www.webkinzestore.com Webkinz eStore]</ref> In 2006, Webkinz had one million online accounts, and according to one estimate published in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' they made $100 million in 2006.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/news/2007/07/webkinz?currentPage=all |title=How to Take Money From Kids: Sell Toys Both Physical and Virtual |date=August 13, 2007 |work=Wired |accessdate=September 19, 2010}}</ref> In 2011, Webkinz made its first commercial on TV. Webkinz was updated in 2015 to Webkinz X, making it more kid-friendly.\n\n== Types of Webkinz==\n{{main|List of Webkinz stuffed animals}}\nThere are many types of Webkinz: regular pets, wild animals, mythical creatures, and made-up ones. They all come with codes that can be entered on the computer at '''www.webkinz.com''' Along with the regular Webkinz toys, there are also smaller, less expensive versions called Lil' Kinz as well as larger, slightly more expensive versions in the Signature collection launched in April 2009. The Signature collection later ended in December 2013. In May 2009, Birthstone Pets were released. One new Birthstone Pet was released for every month. In April 2010, Ganz replaced the Birthstone Pets with the Zodiac Pets. Again, one Zodiac Pet will be released every month. In 2011, CandyKinz were released. In June 2012, Rockerz Pets were released. In 2019, Ganz announced that no new plush pets would be released as of now, but purely virtual pets can still be purchased, accounts can be made, and the website still operates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webkinznewz.ganzworld.com/announcements/official-statement-on-the-future-of-webkinz-plush-toys/|title=Official Statement on the Future of Webkinz Plush Toys {{!}} WKN: Webkinz Newz|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nEach Webkinz [[stuffed animal]] and Webkinz accessory comes with an 8-character [[code]]. By registering this code at www.webkinz.com, the customer \"[[adopt]]s\" this pet in the [[virtuality|virtual]] '''Webkinz World'''. Without the code, the user will not get access to the full Webkinz World, but they can create a free account. On January 19, 2011, Ganz announced that Webkinz World accounts would no longer expire, meaning users would not have to buy a new pet each year to renew their account. However, some games, furniture, and other features are limited with a free account. Young adults who had active accounts on the website, have even revisited their pets to catch up on their health as an online trend.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBgF8l08SR4</ref>\n\nThe Webkinz World is an [[online play]] area with its own [[economy]] completely controlled by Ganz. The user receives money (called '''KinzCash''') by adopting new pets, playing [[online games]], answering general knowledge questions, and through daily activities like clicking \"I love my Webkinz!\", spinning the ''Wheel of WOW'', playing ''Wishing Well 2'', or completing jobs (minigames) available once every 8 hours. Each day, there is a Game of the Day which can be played for bonus KinzCash, and other bonuses are available each hour, full days on weekends and afternoons only on weekdays. With each Webkinz toy purchased, more KinzCash, rooms, and items are added to the user's account.\n\nThe online world also contains many rare or exclusive items. Some of these items require developing a friendship with the Curio Shop owner to purchase, while others are obtained by registering other Webkinz accessories purchased in the real world. Each type of pet gets a special item and food available exclusively for them. Also, a Pet of the Month is announced at the beginning of each month. If a person registers the announced pet in that month, they will receive other exclusive items.\n\nMany of the tasks in Webkinz World involve collecting items. For example, [[recipe]]s are released for the players through [[cookbook]]s or one of the TV shows called ''The Secret Chef''. \"Gems\" can be mined once a day at the ''Curio Shop'', with a full set of gems being turned into the ''Webkinz Crown of Wonder'' and buy exclusive items. A similar feature called ''Alyssa's Star Challenge'', involves users clicking on colored stars to find valuable stars.\n\nOther features of Webkinz include:\n* The ability to create shows with the [[Webkinz#Webkinz Studio|Webkinz Studio]], and enter to be chosen to appear on the Webkinz TV.\n* Buying a [[swimming pool]], a trampoline, and a treadmill where Webkinz can improve their health.\n* Sending gifts or letters to friends on a peer-to-peer network.\n* Inviting a friend over to your house, where you can chat and interact with some board games and items.\n* Participate in the hourly events, which can earn you prizes, KinzCash, and coupons, among other things.\n* Brushing, washing, and bathing your pet.\n* Setting up a party, inviting guests, playing games and giving out loot bags. (a Party Pack costs 750 to 1000 KinzCash)\n* Playing a variety of games such as gem mining.\n*Trading items with other players in a safe and fun way.\n* Reading virtual books exclusive to the Webkinz World.\n* Enrolling your virtual pet in school, or \"The Kinzville Academy\" where your pet can learn and develop skills to help them compete in tournaments.\n* Decorating your pets' home. Furniture can be purchased via the W-shop in the Webkinz World.\n* Interacting with other players via the Webkinz Clubhouse, where players can play games such as \"Link'd\" (Connect four), Checkers, and much more.\n* Shopping for clothes with your pet.\n\n=== Webkinz Studio ===\n* The Webkinz Studio generally costs 1000 KinzCash in the W Shop.\n* There are currently 18 characters and 9 sets. One can buy more from the W Shop.\n* In 2008, a very strict dictionary was added to secure the words used in the studio.\n* In March 2010, Webkinz announced that the Studio had been \"enhanced\" with more features, including \"slide transitions\", the \"who speaks first\" option, and character entrances and exits.\n* Also, the Studio can be found in the Curio Shop on a rare basis for less than 1000 KinzCash.\n\n== Membership ==\nWhen a pet is registered at www.webkinz.com (or \"adopted\"), it gives or renews an account's full membership features for one year. When the membership of a pet expires, the account becomes a free account, missing the ability to play some games, buy certain items, and do other things in the world. However, a player can renew their account again whenever.\n\nThere is also an upgrade to regular memberships called the Deluxe Membership which is available at the [http://www.ganzestore.com/estore/membership/catalog/Deluxe%20Membership?productsSize=15 Ganz eStore]. This is a premium membership with many features, benefits, games, and prizes to which regular accounts do not have access. Deluxe Members also receive free Webkinz eStore points at the time of purchase and at the beginning of each month afterward for the extent of the Deluxe Membership.\n\nIf one wants to register an account at www.webkinz.com without a pet code, they are permitted to select from 9 Ganz eStore Pets. Several limitations exist on free accounts that make many challenges and activities impossible. Free accounts can be upgraded to regular memberships or Deluxe Memberships at any time.<ref>http://webkinznewz.ganzworld.com/announcements/help/</ref>\n\n== W-Plus & Trading Cards ==\nAside from the Webkinz, Lil' Kinz, Signature, and Rockerz Pets, Ganz also has made other toys that can be used on Webkinz World. These are called W-Plus items, and all W-Plus items come with a secret code that can be used in the Code Shop in Webkinz World. These codes unlock items for the Webkinz Pets, like new room themes, clothing for pets, KinzCash, and other prizes.\n\n=== W-Plus ===\nThese are all of the W-Plus items Ganz has released:<ref>[http://customerservice.webkinz.com/collectionscatalog/us_en/index_acc.html Webkinz Collection Catalog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* Body spray and lip gloss\u2014unlocks a piece of furniture for the Glam Boutique theme\n* Clothing for the Webkinz stuffed toys\u2014unlocks the KinzStyle bag, which can be used to access the KinzStyle Shop.

The cards come in booster packs, with 5 playing cards and a code card in each pack. In these packs, there are also chances of getting special cards as well, like free pet codes. In Series 1, you can also get Curio Shop Curiosities and Webkinz Doodlez.<ref>[http://www.webkinz.com/us_en/TC_about.html Webkinz - Webkinz Trading Cards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In Series 2, there is At Paw Level and W-Tales Snapshots instead. These special cards are foil. For Series 1, 80 base cards have been released, 12 challenges, 8 Curio Shop Curiosities, and 8 Webkinz Doodlez. In Series 2, there are 85 base cards, 15 challenges, 8 At Paw Levels and 8 W-Tales Snapshots.<ref>[http://www.webkinz.com/us_en/bulletinz_tcg2.html Webkinz - Trading Cards Series II Available Now! Read all about it!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The cards are also W-Plus items, and they each come with 2-5 codes. 1 code on each card is for a virtual pack of Trading Cards, while the other 1-4 can unlock prizes like rare and exclusive themes or coupons. Series 3 changed the format, with only 1 feature code per pack, and no code for a virtual pack.  The packs also included stickers and a chance to win a previously unheard-of Pet, the Magical Retriever.  Also, Ganz has said that each Series 3 code gives you an item you cannot find anywhere else in Webkinz World. Series 4 has also been released, and the prize Pet, the Mystical Panda, replaces the Magical Retriever.\n\n== Ganz eStore ==\nThe Ganz eStore is targeted to an older audience of the website, it can be used to purchase virtual pets,  furniture and items with real currency. Sales of plush Webkinz and Lil' Kinz are limited to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], however, virtual pets can be purchased from the Ganz eStore by international residents. Secret Codes issued in conjunction with virtual pets can be used the same way as Secret Codes attached to plush pets.<ref name=\"Webkinz eStore\"/>\n\nDeluxe Members get free Ganz eStore points every month.\n\n== Webkinz games ==\nWebkinz World has many games in which players can play to earn KinzCash. The website also has a wide range of multiplayer games for users to play against their friends and anyone else who wants to play at the time. There are some games specifically reserved for a premium tier of users, called Deluxe Membership.\n\n== Criticism ==\nConcerns have been raised about children's use and overuse of the toys. Parents may worry that children will become [[Behavioral addiction|addicted]] to the game.<ref name=\"ABC\">{{cite web|title=Is the Webkinz Craze Bad for Kids?|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=2007-04-23|date=2007-04-12|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=33380}}</ref> Some parents have voiced concerns about the website's [[online chat]] system.

A similar feature called ''Alyssa's Star Challenge'', involves users clicking on colored stars to find valuable stars.\n\nOther features of Webkinz include:\n* The ability to create shows with the [[Webkinz#Webkinz Studio|Webkinz Studio]], and enter to be chosen to appear on the Webkinz TV.\n* Buying a [[swimming pool]], a trampoline, and a treadmill where Webkinz can improve their health.\n* Sending gifts or letters to friends on a peer-to-peer network.\n* Inviting a friend over to your house, where you can chat and interact with some board games and items.\n* Participate in the hourly events, which can earn you prizes, KinzCash, and coupons, among other things.\n* Brushing, washing, and bathing your pet.\n* Setting up a party, inviting guests, playing games and giving out loot bags. (a Party Pack costs 750 to 1000 KinzCash)\n* Playing a variety of games such as gem mining.\n*Trading items with other players in a safe and fun way.\n* Reading virtual books exclusive to the Webkinz World.\n* Enrolling your virtual pet in school, or \"The Kinzville Academy\" where your pet can learn and develop skills to help them compete in tournaments.\n* Decorating your pets' home. Furniture can be purchased via the W-shop in the Webkinz World.\n* Interacting with other players via the Webkinz Clubhouse, where players can play games such as \"Link'd\" (Connect four), Checkers, and much more.\n* Shopping for clothes with your pet.\n\n=== Webkinz Studio ===\n* The Webkinz Studio generally costs 1000 KinzCash in the W Shop.\n* There are currently 18 characters and 9 sets. One can buy more from the W Shop.\n* In 2008, a very strict dictionary was added to secure the words used in the studio.\n* In March 2010, Webkinz announced that the Studio had been \"enhanced\" with more features, including \"slide transitions\", the \"who speaks first\" option, and character entrances and exits.\n* Also, the Studio can be found in the Curio Shop on a rare basis for less than 1000 KinzCash.\n\n== Membership ==\nWhen a pet is registered at www.webkinz.com (or \"adopted\"), it gives or renews an account's full membership features for one year. When the membership of a pet expires, the account becomes a free account, missing the ability to play some games, buy certain items, and do other things in the world. However, a player can renew their account again whenever.\n\nThere is also an upgrade to regular memberships called the Deluxe Membership which is available at the [http://www.ganzestore.com/estore/membership/catalog/Deluxe%20Membership?productsSize=15 Ganz eStore]. This is a premium membership with many features, benefits, games, and prizes to which regular accounts do not have access. Deluxe Members also receive free Webkinz eStore points at the time of purchase and at the beginning of each month afterward for the extent of the Deluxe Membership.\n\nIf one wants to register an account at www.webkinz.com without a pet code, they are permitted to select from 9 Ganz eStore Pets. Several limitations exist on free accounts that make many challenges and activities impossible. Free accounts can be upgraded to regular memberships or Deluxe Memberships at any time.<ref>http://webkinznewz.ganzworld.com/announcements/help/</ref>\n\n== W-Plus & Trading Cards ==\nAside from the Webkinz, Lil' Kinz, Signature, and Rockerz Pets, Ganz also has made other toys that can be used on Webkinz World. These are called W-Plus items, and all W-Plus items come with a secret code that can be used in the Code Shop in Webkinz World. These codes unlock items for the Webkinz Pets, like new room themes, clothing for pets, KinzCash, and other prizes.\n\n=== W-Plus ===\nThese are all of the W-Plus items Ganz has released:<ref>[http://customerservice.webkinz.com/collectionscatalog/us_en/index_acc.html Webkinz Collection Catalog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* Body spray and lip gloss\u2014unlocks a piece of furniture for the Glam Boutique theme\n* Clothing for the Webkinz stuffed toys\u2014unlocks the KinzStyle bag, which can be used to access the KinzStyle Shop.

The cards come in booster packs, with 5 playing cards and a code card in each pack. In these packs, there are also chances of getting special cards as well, like free pet codes. In Series 1, you can also get Curio Shop Curiosities and Webkinz Doodlez.<ref>[http://www.webkinz.com/us_en/TC_about.html Webkinz - Webkinz Trading Cards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In Series 2, there is At Paw Level and W-Tales Snapshots instead. These special cards are foil. For Series 1, 80 base cards have been released, 12 challenges, 8 Curio Shop Curiosities, and 8 Webkinz Doodlez. In Series 2, there are 85 base cards, 15 challenges, 8 At Paw Levels and 8 W-Tales Snapshots.<ref>[http://www.webkinz.com/us_en/bulletinz_tcg2.html Webkinz - Trading Cards Series II Available Now! Read all about it!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The cards are also W-Plus items, and they each come with 2-5 codes. 1 code on each card is for a virtual pack of Trading Cards, while the other 1-4 can unlock prizes like rare and exclusive themes or coupons. Series 3 changed the format, with only 1 feature code per pack, and no code for a virtual pack.  The packs also included stickers and a chance to win a previously unheard-of Pet, the Magical Retriever.  Also, Ganz has said that each Series 3 code gives you an item you cannot find anywhere else in Webkinz World. Series 4 has also been released, and the prize Pet, the Mystical Panda, replaces the Magical Retriever.\n\n== Ganz eStore ==\nThe Ganz eStore is targeted to an older audience of the website, it can be used to purchase virtual pets,  furniture and items with real currency. Sales of plush Webkinz and Lil' Kinz are limited to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], however, virtual pets can be purchased from the Ganz eStore by international residents. Secret Codes issued in conjunction with virtual pets can be used the same way as Secret Codes attached to plush pets.<ref name=\"Webkinz eStore\"/>\n\nDeluxe Members get free Ganz eStore points every month.\n\n== Webkinz games ==\nWebkinz World has many games in which players can play to earn KinzCash. The website also has a wide range of multiplayer games for users to play against their friends and anyone else who wants to play at the time. There are some games specifically reserved for a premium tier of users, called Deluxe Membership.\n\n== Criticism ==\nConcerns have been raised about children's use and overuse of the toys. Parents may worry that children will become [[Behavioral addiction|addicted]] to the game.<ref name=\"ABC\">{{cite web|title=Is the Webkinz Craze Bad for Kids?|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=2007-04-23|date=2007-04-12|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=33380}}</ref> Some parents have voiced concerns about the website's [[online chat]] system.

Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks and was made a [[brigadier general]] by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with [[Napoleon]] was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a [[Marshal of the Empire]] on the proclamation of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], and was made [[Principality of Pontecorvo|Prince of Pontecorvo]] as a reward.\n\nIn 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the [[heir-presumptive]] to the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], thanks to the advocacy of Baron [[Carl Otto M\u00f6rner]], a Swedish courtier and obscure member of the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].{{sfn|Cronholm|1902|pp=249\u201371}} He assumed the name Charles John and became the ''[[de facto]]'' regent and head of state. In 1813, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of [[Swedish Pomerania]], Crown Prince Charles John aligned Sweden with Napoleon's enemies in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], wherein he authored the Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. He went on to defeat Denmark and forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] in 1818, Charles John ascended to the throne as the first monarch from the [[House of Bernadotte]]. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Pau Bernadotte.JPG|100px|thumb|left|Bernadotte's birthplace in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France]]\nBernadotte was born in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, as the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711\u20131780), [[prosecutor]] at Pau, and his wife (married at [[Boeil-Bezing|Boeil]], 20 February 1754) Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728\u20131809), [[niece]] of the [[Lay Abbot]] of [[Sireix]]. The family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadotte\u2014a surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean \u00c9vangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under [[Napoleon I]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}\n\nAt the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local attorney. However, the death of his father when Bernadotte was just 17 stopped the youth from following his father's career.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 6</ref>\n\n==Early military career==\nBernadotte joined the army as a private in the [[R\u00e9giment Royal\u2013La Marine]] on 3 September 1780,<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 5</ref> and first served in the newly conquered territory of [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Subsequently, the R\u00e9giment stationed in [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[Grenoble]], [[Vienne]], [[Marseille]] and [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 8\u201313</ref><ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 14</ref> He reached the rank of sergeant in August 1785 and was nicknamed ''Sergeant Belle-Jambe'', for his smart appearance.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 11</ref> In early 1790 he was promoted to [[Adjudant-Major]], the highest rank for [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the Ancien R\u00e9gime.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 15</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary Wars==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Bernadotte's promotions came both from the esteem of his commanders as well as from his men; having been elected to the rank of lieutenant colonel and colonel by his men, though he refused both nominations in favor of traditional advancement.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 50\u201352, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period of rapid advancement that the military qualities he became known for, daring assaults and Gasconades, came to the fore. Of the latter, Bernadotte was gifted in his ability to inspire his men to prodigious feats of valor. As Colonel and commander of the 71st Demi-Brigade, Bernadotte rallied his men, who were retreating in disorder before an Austrian attack, by tearing off his epaulettes, throwing them to the ground before his men and shouting \u201cIf you dishonor yourselves by flight, I refuse to remain your colonel!\u201d Soldiers left the ranks, gathered his epaulettes, pressed them into his hands, formed ranks and reformed the line and counter-attacked.<ref>Ibid, pp. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nBy 1794 he was promoted to brigadier, attached to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} After [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] (26 June 1794), where he distinguished himself with a decisive attack and seizure of key terrain that led to the Austrian retreat, he then became a divisional general.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 92\u201394</ref>\n\nBernadotte played key roles throughout the next 18 months during the three French invasions into Germany; often employed in the place of honor during offensives leading the vanguard, and in retreat as a defensive specialist commanding the rearguard.<ref>Ibid. pp. 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Theiningen]] (1796), Bernadotte contributed, more than anyone else, to the successful retreat of the French army over the [[Rhine]] after its defeat by the [[Archduke Charles of Austria]].<ref>Ibid. pp. 110\u201314.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1797 he was ordered by the Directory to march with 20,000 men as reinforcements to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army in Italy.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} His successful crossing of the Alps through the storm in midwinter was highly praised but coldly received by the Italian Army.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 42</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 42</ref> Upon receiving insult from [[Dominique Martin Dupuy]], the commander of Milan, Bernadotte was to arrest him for insubordination.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 42\u201343</ref> However, Dupuy was a close friend of [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and this started a long-lasting feud between Bernadotte and Napoleon's Chief of Staff.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 44</ref>\n\nHe had his first interview with Napoleon in Mantua and was appointed the commander of the 4th division.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 43</ref> During the invasion of Friuli and Istria, Bernadotte distinguished himself greatly at the passage of the [[Tagliamento]] where he led the vanguard, and at the capture of the fortress of Gradisca (19 March 1797).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|18th Fructidor]], Napoleon ordered his generals to collect from their respective divisions' addresses in favor of the coup d'\u00e9tat of that day; but Bernadotte sent an address to the directory different from that which Napoleon wished for and without conveying it through Napoleon's hands.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter the [[treaty of Campo Formio]], Napoleon gave Bernadotte a friendly visit at his headquarters at Udine, but immediately after deprived him of half his division of the army of the Rhine, and commanded him to march the other half back to France.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} [[Paul Barras]], one of five directors, was cautious that Napoleon would overturn the Republic, so he appointed Bernadotte commander-in-chief of the Italian Army in order to offset Napoleon's power.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 60\u201361</ref> Bernadotte was pleased with this appointment but Napoleon lobbied [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to appoint him to the embassy of [[Vienna]] instead.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 61</ref> Bernadotte was very dissatisfied; he finally accepted the post in Vienna, but had to quit owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] over the [[embassy]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter returning from Vienna, he resided in Paris. He married [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]] in August 1798, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant and [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s sister-in-law.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} In November of the same year he was made commander of the army of observation on the upper Rhine. Although solicited to do so by Barras and Joseph Bonaparte, he did not take part in [[Coup of 30 Prairial VII|the coup d'\u00e9tat of the 30th Prairial]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 84</ref> From 2 July to 14 September he was [[List of Defence Ministers of France|Minister of War]], in which capacity he displayed great ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} However, his popularity and contacts with radical Jacobins aroused antipathy towards him in the government.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 88</ref> On the morning of 13 September he found his resignation announced in the Moniteur before he was aware that he had tendered it. This was a trick; played upon him by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] and [[Roger Ducos]], the directors allied to Napoleon.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHe declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of November 1799]] but nevertheless accepted employment from the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and from April 1800 to 18 August 1801 Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the West, in the rebellious [[Vend\u00e9e]], and successfully restored its tranquility.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed that Bernadotte head to New France to serve as governor of [[Louisiana]], which was to be transferred back to French control following the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. In accepting the position, Bernadotte requested additional soldiers, settlers, and funding to support the colony, but Napoleon refused. In response, Bernadotte, declined the posting and instead was named plenipotentiary ambassador to the United States.

In this capacity, as well as during his later command of the army of northern Germany, he created for himself a reputation for independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and administrative ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nDuring the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte, with his army corps from Hanover formed into the I Corps, commanded the Left Wing of the Grand Army overseeing Marmont's II Corps and having the majority of the Bavarian Army attached to his command; some 65,000 men or 1/4th of the Army. Bernadotte was also tasked with assuring France's newest ally, the Elector of Bavaria, [[Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria|Maximillian Joseph]], that the Austrians would be driven from his country.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 150-151</ref><ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 106-109</ref>\n\nBernadotte, with Davout's III Corps attached to his command, and the Bavarians, gained a victory over the Austrians driving them out of Munich on October 12th, taking some 3000 prisoners and 19 guns and installing Maximillian Joseph back onto his throne.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 108-109</ref> I Corps then co-operated in the great movement which resulted in the shutting off of [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] in the Battle of [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]]. Bernadotte's troops then captured [[Salzburg]] on 30 October.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 222-226</ref>\n\nIn the Battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (2 December 1805) he was posted with his corps in the center between [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] and [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], and contributed to defeating the attempt of the right wing of the allies to outflank the French army.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} As a reward for his services at Austerlitz, he became the 1st Sovereign [[Prince]] of [[Ponte Corvo]] (5 June 1806), a district of Naples formerly subject to the Pope.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHowever, during the campaign against [[Prussia]], in the same year, he was severely reproached by Napoleon for not participating with his army corps in the battles of [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] and [[Battle of Auerst\u00e4dt|Auerst\u00e4dt]] (14 October 1806).{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Napoleon, on the night of 13 October, thinking he had faced the whole Prussian army at Jena, sent orders to Bernadotte and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] to fall back from [[Naumburg]] and get across the Prussian line of retreat. In pursuance of these orders, Bernadotte, separately from Davout, left Naumburg at dawn on the morning of the 14th for [[Dornburg]] and marched towards [[Apolda]], which he reached by 16:00.

However, Bernadotte maintained strict discipline amongst his troops and his good treatment of the Danes made him popular with the populace and Danish Royal Family. Upon his departure from Denmark he was one of few Frenchmen of the period to be awarded the [[Order of the Elephant]].<ref>Barton, pp. 194\u201396</ref>\n\nDuring Bernadotte's time as governor of the Hanseatic cities, the [[Abdications of Bayonne]] occurred, an event that triggered the [[Peninsular War]] that would play so large a role in Napoleon's defeat. For a time Napoleon considered the notion of placing Bernadotte on the Spanish throne; going so far as to hint at it in a letter to him. However, Bernadotte made it known to Napoleon that he didn't want the Spanish Crown.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 192\u201393.</ref> [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Bernadotte's friend and brother-in-law, was chosen instead. It was not the first, or last time, that Napoleon thought of placing Bernadotte on a foreign throne. Indeed, Napoleon on several occasions, both during his days as First Consul and then as Emperor, thought of naming Bernadotte (Napoleon also considered Murat) as his successor by adoption. Despite their rivalry, Napoleon felt that Bernadotte alone had the popularity, administrative and military skill to safeguard the Empire he had built. However, the birth of the [[Napoleon II|King of Rome]] put an end to Napoleon's need for an heir.<ref>Ibid. p. 209.</ref> Ironically, Bernadotte did eventually wear a crown, not through the auspices of Napoleon, but as an enemy of France.<ref>Ibid, pp. 192\u201395</ref>\n\nBeing recalled to Germany to assist in the new war between France and Austria, he received the command of the 9th Corps, which was mainly composed of [[Saxony|Saxons]].{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}  Further difficulties with Berthier, and being saddled with ill-prepared Saxons, combined with an illness, compelled Bernadotte to beg for release from service.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}} Bernadotte wrote to Napoleon that \"I see my efforts perpetually paralyzed by a hidden force over which I can not prevail.\"{{sfn|Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket |1930|pp=216\u201317}} Napoleon disregarded these appeals and Bernadotte proceeded with the campaign, commanding mostly foreign troops with few French troops under his command.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|pp=284\u201385}}\nAt the [[Battle of Wagram]] (5 July 1809), he entered battle with his Saxon corps, to which the division of [[Pierre-Louis Dupas|Dupas]] was attached and which formed his reserve. Resting on the French Left, Bernadotte's corps was battered during the night but resisted the full fury of the Austrian attack facing superior numbers. At a critical moment he ordered Dupas forward to his support; the latter replied that he had orders from the emperor to remain where he was. Having been badly mauled, and fully exposed ahead of the main French line, IX Corps withdrew from the village of Aderklaa against Napoleon's orders. On the second day of battle, 6 July 1809, IX Corps, having been mauled the night before, wherein Bernadotte struggled to rally his demoralized Saxons, was attacked by two Austrian corps, as part of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles's]] effort to break the French line. This time Bernadotte's depleted forces - he had only 6,000 infantry left - broke and fled (Bernadotte's Corps was not the only one to have broken that day, Mass\u00e9na's troops were also routed by the attack). The routed Saxons retreated in disorder toward Raasdorf as Bernadotte attempted to rally his men, where he encountered Napoleon. IX Corps rallied and played a further role in the battle. Rumors that Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command on the spot at Raasdorf have long been the stuff of legend, but are not verified.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 223\u201325.</ref> After the battle, Bernadotte complained to Napoleon for having, in violation of all military rules, ordered Dupas to act independently of his command, and for having thereby caused great loss of life to the Saxons, and tendered his resignation. Napoleon accepted after he had become aware of an order of the day issued by Bernadotte in which he gave the Saxons credit for their courage in terms inconsistent with the emperor's official bulletin.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Accounts of Bernadotte's role at Wagram are contradictory. While it is true that IX Corps broke on 6 July, as did other French formations, they later rallied and played a part in the victory. Moreover, Bernadotte fought with exceptional personal courage, at the head of his troops, and narrowly averted death when attacked by Austrian cavalry. It is likely that IX Corps' poor performance would have been forgotten, and Bernadotte would have retained his command, had he never published the controversial Order of the Day.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 227\u201328.</ref> However, Bernadotte's praise for the Saxons, as well as his mild and courteous treatment of them while under his command, was never forgotten by the Saxon officers and this would later have disastrous consequences for the French when a whole Saxon division defected to Bernadotte's Army of the North during a key moment of the [[Battle of Leipzig]].<ref>Smith, Digby (2001). pp. 225\u201329</ref>\n\nWith Bernadotte having returned to Paris, the [[Walcheren Campaign]] (July 1809) caused the French ministry in the absence of the emperor to entrust him with the defense of [[Antwerp]] with both regular French and Dutch troops along with the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 153</ref> Bernadotte, with his customary skill, took command of a chaotic situation wherein troops from all over the Empire and its vassal states, and raw conscripts, were sent to Holland under divided command. He re-organized and trained his forces, named by the Emperor as the Army of Antwerp, by instilling discipline in old soldiers too long at the depots and teaching raw conscripts their trade. Everywhere he instilled a fighting spirit, making an army out of a mob, and thus he rapidly brought the defenses of Antwerp to a high order of readiness.<ref>Barton, Plunkett (1921). pp. 237\u201340</ref> With Antwerp bristling with cannon and numerous defenders, and with the Army of Antwerp whipped into fighting shape, the British, vexed by poor leadership and with half the army immobilized with fever thanks to the insalubrious islands upon which they were quartered, realized that it was no longer possible to close the [[Scheldt]], or take Antwerp, and withdrew their forces.<ref>Howard, Martin (2012). pp. 139\u201347.</ref> In a proclamation issued to his troops at Antwerp he made an implied charge against Napoleon of having neglected to prepare the proper means of defense for the Belgian coast.

He was also childless; [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Charlotte]] had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child.

However, Eug\u00e8ne, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon's brothers was interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Charles died prematurely.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 250\u201356, 268\u201372.</ref> The matter was decided by an obscure Swedish courtier, son of Baron Gustav M\u00f6rner, a commander of the Swedish force captured by Bernadotte at L\u00fcbeck, Baron [[Karl Otto M\u00f6rner]], who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte.

The keynote of his whole policy was the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland and Bernadotte proved anything but a puppet of France.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland, which had been ceded to Russia; however, the Crown Prince was aware of its difficulty for reasons of the desperate situation of the state finance and the reluctance of the Finnish people to return to Sweden.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). p. 39</ref> Even if Finland was regained, he thought, it would put Sweden into a new cycle of conflicts with a powerful neighbor because there was no guarantee Russia would accept the loss as final.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 181</ref> Therefore, he made up his mind to make a united [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian peninsula]], which was easier to defend, by taking Norway (intentionally without the ancient and remote provinces of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]) from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden.

This demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and the Swedish population. Sweden reluctantly declared war against Great Britain but it was treated by both countries as being merely nominal, although Swedish imports of British goods decreased from \u00a34,871 million in 1810 to \u00a3523 million in the following year.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 259</ref>\n\nIn January 1812, French troops suddenly invaded [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[island of R\u00fcgen]].<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 265</ref> The decisive reason was that Napoleon, before marching to Moscow, had to secure his rear and dared not trust a Swedish continental foothold behind him.<ref name=\"Scott, Franklin D.1988.

The Norwegian constitution gave the Norwegian parliament, the [[Storting]], more power than any legislature in Europe.  While Charles John had the power of absolute veto in Sweden, he only had a suspensive veto in Norway.  He demanded that the Storting give him the power of absolute veto, but was forced to back down.<ref name=Norway/> Charles John's difficult relationship with Norway was also demonstrated by the Storting's unwillingness to grant funds for the construction of a [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] in the Norwegian capital [[Oslo]]. The construction began in 1825, but the [[Storting]] halted the funding after the costly foundation was laid and demanded that the appointed architect, [[Hans Linstow]], construct a simpler palace. This was seen by many as a protest against unnecessary spending and the king's authority. The palace itself was not completed until 1849, long after the death of Charles John, and was inaugurated by [[Oscar I of Sweden|Oscar I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/artikkel.html?tid=33470&sek=33469|title=History of the Royal Palace|website=www.kongehuset.no|language=no|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref> The main street in Oslo, ''Slottsgate''n, would later be named after Charles John as [[Karl Johans gate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/artikkel.html?tid=28686|title=King Carl Johan (1763\u20131844)|website=www.kongehuset.no|language=no|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nHis popularity decreased for a time in the 1830s, culminating in the [[Rabulist riots]] after the [[L\u00e8se-majest\u00e9]] conviction of the journalist [[Magnus Jacob Crusenstolpe]], and some calls for his abdication.<ref name=Britannica/> Charles John survived the abdication controversy and he went on to have his [[silver jubilee]], which was celebrated with great enthusiasm on 18 February 1843.

Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks and was made a [[brigadier general]] by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with [[Napoleon]] was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a [[Marshal of the Empire]] on the proclamation of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], and was made [[Principality of Pontecorvo|Prince of Pontecorvo]] as a reward.\n\nIn 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the [[heir-presumptive]] to the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], thanks to the advocacy of Baron [[Carl Otto M\u00f6rner]], a Swedish courtier and obscure member of the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].{{sfn|Cronholm|1902|pp=249\u201371}} He assumed the name Charles John and became the ''[[de facto]]'' regent and head of state. In 1813, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of [[Swedish Pomerania]], Crown Prince Charles John aligned Sweden with Napoleon's enemies in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], wherein he authored the Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. He went on to defeat Denmark and forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] in 1818, Charles John ascended to the throne as the first monarch from the [[House of Bernadotte]]. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Pau Bernadotte.JPG|100px|thumb|left|Bernadotte's birthplace in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France]]\nBernadotte was born in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, as the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711\u20131780), [[prosecutor]] at Pau, and his wife (married at [[Boeil-Bezing|Boeil]], 20 February 1754) Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728\u20131809), [[niece]] of the [[Lay Abbot]] of [[Sireix]]. The family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadotte\u2014a surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean \u00c9vangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under [[Napoleon I]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}\n\nAt the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local attorney. However, the death of his father when Bernadotte was just 17 stopped the youth from following his father's career.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 6</ref>\n\n==Early military career==\nBernadotte joined the army as a private in the [[R\u00e9giment Royal\u2013La Marine]] on 3 September 1780,<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 5</ref> and first served in the newly conquered territory of [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Subsequently, the R\u00e9giment stationed in [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[Grenoble]], [[Vienne]], [[Marseille]] and [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 8\u201313</ref><ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 14</ref> He reached the rank of sergeant in August 1785 and was nicknamed ''Sergeant Belle-Jambe'', for his smart appearance.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 11</ref> In early 1790 he was promoted to [[Adjudant-Major]], the highest rank for [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the Ancien R\u00e9gime.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 15</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary Wars==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Bernadotte's promotions came both from the esteem of his commanders as well as from his men; having been elected to the rank of lieutenant colonel and colonel by his men, though he refused both nominations in favor of traditional advancement.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 50\u201352, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period of rapid advancement that the military qualities he became known for, daring assaults and Gasconades, came to the fore. Of the latter, Bernadotte was gifted in his ability to inspire his men to prodigious feats of valor. As Colonel and commander of the 71st Demi-Brigade, Bernadotte rallied his men, who were retreating in disorder before an Austrian attack, by tearing off his epaulettes, throwing them to the ground before his men and shouting \u201cIf you dishonor yourselves by flight, I refuse to remain your colonel!\u201d Soldiers left the ranks, gathered his epaulettes, pressed them into his hands, formed ranks and reformed the line and counter-attacked.<ref>Ibid, pp. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nBy 1794 he was promoted to brigadier, attached to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} After [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] (26 June 1794), where he distinguished himself with a decisive attack and seizure of key terrain that led to the Austrian retreat, he then became a divisional general.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 92\u201394</ref>\n\nBernadotte played key roles throughout the next 18 months during the three French invasions into Germany; often employed in the place of honor during offensives leading the vanguard, and in retreat as a defensive specialist commanding the rearguard.<ref>Ibid. pp. 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Theiningen]] (1796), Bernadotte contributed, more than anyone else, to the successful retreat of the French army over the [[Rhine]] after its defeat by the [[Archduke Charles of Austria]].<ref>Ibid. pp. 110\u201314.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1797 he was ordered by the Directory to march with 20,000 men as reinforcements to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army in Italy.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} His successful crossing of the Alps through the storm in midwinter was highly praised but coldly received by the Italian Army.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 42</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 42</ref> Upon receiving insult from [[Dominique Martin Dupuy]], the commander of Milan, Bernadotte was to arrest him for insubordination.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 42\u201343</ref> However, Dupuy was a close friend of [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and this started a long-lasting feud between Bernadotte and Napoleon's Chief of Staff.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 44</ref>\n\nHe had his first interview with Napoleon in Mantua and was appointed the commander of the 4th division.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 43</ref> During the invasion of Friuli and Istria, Bernadotte distinguished himself greatly at the passage of the [[Tagliamento]] where he led the vanguard, and at the capture of the fortress of Gradisca (19 March 1797).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|18th Fructidor]], Napoleon ordered his generals to collect from their respective divisions' addresses in favor of the coup d'\u00e9tat of that day; but Bernadotte sent an address to the directory different from that which Napoleon wished for and without conveying it through Napoleon's hands.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter the [[treaty of Campo Formio]], Napoleon gave Bernadotte a friendly visit at his headquarters at Udine, but immediately after deprived him of half his division of the army of the Rhine, and commanded him to march the other half back to France.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} [[Paul Barras]], one of five directors, was cautious that Napoleon would overturn the Republic, so he appointed Bernadotte commander-in-chief of the Italian Army in order to offset Napoleon's power.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 60\u201361</ref> Bernadotte was pleased with this appointment but Napoleon lobbied [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to appoint him to the embassy of [[Vienna]] instead.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 61</ref> Bernadotte was very dissatisfied; he finally accepted the post in Vienna, but had to quit owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] over the [[embassy]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter returning from Vienna, he resided in Paris. He married [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]] in August 1798, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant and [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s sister-in-law.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} In November of the same year he was made commander of the army of observation on the upper Rhine. Although solicited to do so by Barras and Joseph Bonaparte, he did not take part in [[Coup of 30 Prairial VII|the coup d'\u00e9tat of the 30th Prairial]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 84</ref> From 2 July to 14 September he was [[List of Defence Ministers of France|Minister of War]], in which capacity he displayed great ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} However, his popularity and contacts with radical Jacobins aroused antipathy towards him in the government.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 88</ref> On the morning of 13 September he found his resignation announced in the Moniteur before he was aware that he had tendered it. This was a trick; played upon him by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] and [[Roger Ducos]], the directors allied to Napoleon.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHe declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of November 1799]] but nevertheless accepted employment from the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and from April 1800 to 18 August 1801 Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the West, in the rebellious [[Vend\u00e9e]], and successfully restored its tranquility.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed that Bernadotte head to New France to serve as governor of [[Louisiana]], which was to be transferred back to French control following the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. In accepting the position, Bernadotte requested additional soldiers, settlers, and funding to support the colony, but Napoleon refused. In response, Bernadotte, declined the posting and instead was named plenipotentiary ambassador to the United States. His posting was cancelled, however, after the [[Louisiana Purchase|Sale of Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite conference | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00974220/document | title = Bernadotte, Bonaparte, and Louisiana: the last dream of a French Empire in North America | first = Jean-Marc | last = Olivier | date = 2010 | editor-last = Belaubre | editor-first = Christope | editor-last2 = Dym | editor-first2 = Jordana | editor-last3 = Savage | editor-first3 = John | book-title = Napoleon's Atlantic: The Impact of Napoleonic Empire in the Atlantic World | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden, Netherlands | pages = 141\u201350 | format = PDF | isbn = 978-9004181540 | access-date = 11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Marshal of the French Empire==\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte.jpg|180px|thumbnail|left|Bernadotte as a Marshal of the Empire]]On the introduction of the [[First French Empire]], Bernadotte became one of the eighteen [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshals of the Empire]], and from June 1804 to September 1805 served as governor of the recently occupied [[Hanover]]. In this capacity, as well as during his later command of the army of northern Germany, he created for himself a reputation for independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and administrative ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nDuring the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte, with his army corps from Hanover formed into the I Corps, commanded the Left Wing of the Grand Army overseeing Marmont's II Corps and having the majority of the Bavarian Army attached to his command; some 65,000 men or 1/4th of the Army. Bernadotte was also tasked with assuring France's newest ally, the Elector of Bavaria, [[Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria|Maximillian Joseph]], that the Austrians would be driven from his country.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 150-151</ref><ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 106-109</ref>\n\nBernadotte, with Davout's III Corps attached to his command, and the Bavarians, gained a victory over the Austrians driving them out of Munich on October 12th, taking some 3000 prisoners and 19 guns and installing Maximillian Joseph back onto his throne.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 108-109</ref> I Corps then co-operated in the great movement which resulted in the shutting off of [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] in the Battle of [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]]. Bernadotte's troops then captured [[Salzburg]] on 30 October.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 222-226</ref>\n\nIn the Battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (2 December 1805) he was posted with his corps in the center between [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] and [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], and contributed to defeating the attempt of the right wing of the allies to outflank the French army.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} As a reward for his services at Austerlitz, he became the 1st Sovereign [[Prince]] of [[Ponte Corvo]] (5 June 1806), a district of Naples formerly subject to the Pope.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHowever, during the campaign against [[Prussia]], in the same year, he was severely reproached by Napoleon for not participating with his army corps in the battles of [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] and [[Battle of Auerst\u00e4dt|Auerst\u00e4dt]] (14 October 1806).{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Napoleon, on the night of 13 October, thinking he had faced the whole Prussian army at Jena, sent orders to Bernadotte and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] to fall back from [[Naumburg]] and get across the Prussian line of retreat. In pursuance of these orders, Bernadotte, separately from Davout, left Naumburg at dawn on the morning of the 14th for [[Dornburg]] and marched towards [[Apolda]], which he reached by 16:00. Hampered by the very poor state of the roads, he could not engage in the Battle of Jena, though he effectively compelled the Prussians to retreat from both battlefields by posting his troops on the heights of Apolda.{{sfn|Titeux, Eugene|1903|pp=86\u2013104}}{{sfn|Foucart, Paul Jean|1887|pp=694\u201397}}{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|pp=758, 764\u201365}}\nAfterwards, Bernadotte was accused of deliberately refusing to support Davout, who had unexpectedly encountered the Prussian main army at Auerst\u00e4dt, out of jealousy, and Napoleon, if reminiscences from St. Helena may be believed, once intended to put Bernadotte before a court-martial.{{sfn|Favier, Franck|2010|pp=137\u201339}}{{sfn|Palmer, Alan|1990|p=135}} In fact, he did what he had been ordered to do, and more fundamental responsibility for his absence rests upon the ambiguous and indirect orders issued by Berthier and Napoleon's unawareness of the Prussian position.{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|p=765}}{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Jena, Bernadotte crushed the Prussian Reserve Army, all fresh troops fortified behind a marsh and the River Saale, under [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1758\u20131822)|Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg]] at [[Battle of Halle|Halle]] (17 October 1806), though Imperial Headquarters did not much appreciate this victory.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 193</ref> When visiting Halle after the battle, and commenting on the degree of difficulty of storming a fortified position accessible only by a single bridge, Napoleon enigmatically commented \"Bernadotte stops at nothing.

Plunkett (1921) pp. 172\u201376</ref> Napoleon, having received word of the Russian offensive, gave word to Bernadotte to retreat West as to draw the Russians toward him so that Napoleon could then cut-off and surround the Russians.

As a consequence, Bernadotte's I Corps was too far away to take part in the [[Battle of Eylau]] (7 to 8 February 1807).

However, Bernadotte maintained strict discipline amongst his troops and his good treatment of the Danes made him popular with the populace and Danish Royal Family. Upon his departure from Denmark he was one of few Frenchmen of the period to be awarded the [[Order of the Elephant]].<ref>Barton, pp. 194\u201396</ref>\n\nDuring Bernadotte's time as governor of the Hanseatic cities, the [[Abdications of Bayonne]] occurred, an event that triggered the [[Peninsular War]] that would play so large a role in Napoleon's defeat. For a time Napoleon considered the notion of placing Bernadotte on the Spanish throne; going so far as to hint at it in a letter to him. However, Bernadotte made it known to Napoleon that he didn't want the Spanish Crown.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 192\u201393.</ref> [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Bernadotte's friend and brother-in-law, was chosen instead. It was not the first, or last time, that Napoleon thought of placing Bernadotte on a foreign throne. Indeed, Napoleon on several occasions, both during his days as First Consul and then as Emperor, thought of naming Bernadotte (Napoleon also considered Murat) as his successor by adoption. Despite their rivalry, Napoleon felt that Bernadotte alone had the popularity, administrative and military skill to safeguard the Empire he had built. However, the birth of the [[Napoleon II|King of Rome]] put an end to Napoleon's need for an heir.<ref>Ibid. p. 209.</ref> Ironically, Bernadotte did eventually wear a crown, not through the auspices of Napoleon, but as an enemy of France.<ref>Ibid, pp. 192\u201395</ref>\n\nBeing recalled to Germany to assist in the new war between France and Austria, he received the command of the 9th Corps, which was mainly composed of [[Saxony|Saxons]].{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}  Further difficulties with Berthier, and being saddled with ill-prepared Saxons, combined with an illness, compelled Bernadotte to beg for release from service.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}} Bernadotte wrote to Napoleon that \"I see my efforts perpetually paralyzed by a hidden force over which I can not prevail.\"{{sfn|Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket |1930|pp=216\u201317}} Napoleon disregarded these appeals and Bernadotte proceeded with the campaign, commanding mostly foreign troops with few French troops under his command.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|pp=284\u201385}}\nAt the [[Battle of Wagram]] (5 July 1809), he entered battle with his Saxon corps, to which the division of [[Pierre-Louis Dupas|Dupas]] was attached and which formed his reserve. Resting on the French Left, Bernadotte's corps was battered during the night but resisted the full fury of the Austrian attack facing superior numbers. At a critical moment he ordered Dupas forward to his support; the latter replied that he had orders from the emperor to remain where he was. Having been badly mauled, and fully exposed ahead of the main French line, IX Corps withdrew from the village of Aderklaa against Napoleon's orders. On the second day of battle, 6 July 1809, IX Corps, having been mauled the night before, wherein Bernadotte struggled to rally his demoralized Saxons, was attacked by two Austrian corps, as part of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles's]] effort to break the French line. This time Bernadotte's depleted forces - he had only 6,000 infantry left - broke and fled (Bernadotte's Corps was not the only one to have broken that day, Mass\u00e9na's troops were also routed by the attack). The routed Saxons retreated in disorder toward Raasdorf as Bernadotte attempted to rally his men, where he encountered Napoleon. IX Corps rallied and played a further role in the battle. Rumors that Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command on the spot at Raasdorf have long been the stuff of legend, but are not verified.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 223\u201325.</ref> After the battle, Bernadotte complained to Napoleon for having, in violation of all military rules, ordered Dupas to act independently of his command, and for having thereby caused great loss of life to the Saxons, and tendered his resignation. Napoleon accepted after he had become aware of an order of the day issued by Bernadotte in which he gave the Saxons credit for their courage in terms inconsistent with the emperor's official bulletin.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Accounts of Bernadotte's role at Wagram are contradictory. While it is true that IX Corps broke on 6 July, as did other French formations, they later rallied and played a part in the victory. Moreover, Bernadotte fought with exceptional personal courage, at the head of his troops, and narrowly averted death when attacked by Austrian cavalry. It is likely that IX Corps' poor performance would have been forgotten, and Bernadotte would have retained his command, had he never published the controversial Order of the Day.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 227\u201328.</ref> However, Bernadotte's praise for the Saxons, as well as his mild and courteous treatment of them while under his command, was never forgotten by the Saxon officers and this would later have disastrous consequences for the French when a whole Saxon division defected to Bernadotte's Army of the North during a key moment of the [[Battle of Leipzig]].<ref>Smith, Digby (2001). pp. 225\u201329</ref>\n\nWith Bernadotte having returned to Paris, the [[Walcheren Campaign]] (July 1809) caused the French ministry in the absence of the emperor to entrust him with the defense of [[Antwerp]] with both regular French and Dutch troops along with the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 153</ref> Bernadotte, with his customary skill, took command of a chaotic situation wherein troops from all over the Empire and its vassal states, and raw conscripts, were sent to Holland under divided command. He re-organized and trained his forces, named by the Emperor as the Army of Antwerp, by instilling discipline in old soldiers too long at the depots and teaching raw conscripts their trade. Everywhere he instilled a fighting spirit, making an army out of a mob, and thus he rapidly brought the defenses of Antwerp to a high order of readiness.<ref>Barton, Plunkett (1921). pp. 237\u201340</ref> With Antwerp bristling with cannon and numerous defenders, and with the Army of Antwerp whipped into fighting shape, the British, vexed by poor leadership and with half the army immobilized with fever thanks to the insalubrious islands upon which they were quartered, realized that it was no longer possible to close the [[Scheldt]], or take Antwerp, and withdrew their forces.<ref>Howard, Martin (2012). pp. 139\u201347.</ref> In a proclamation issued to his troops at Antwerp he made an implied charge against Napoleon of having neglected to prepare the proper means of defense for the Belgian coast.

He was also childless; [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Charlotte]] had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child.

However, Eug\u00e8ne, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon's brothers was interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Charles died prematurely.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 250\u201356, 268\u201372.</ref> The matter was decided by an obscure Swedish courtier, son of Baron Gustav M\u00f6rner, a commander of the Swedish force captured by Bernadotte at L\u00fcbeck, Baron [[Karl Otto M\u00f6rner]], who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte.

The keynote of his whole policy was the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland and Bernadotte proved anything but a puppet of France.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland, which had been ceded to Russia; however, the Crown Prince was aware of its difficulty for reasons of the desperate situation of the state finance and the reluctance of the Finnish people to return to Sweden.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). p. 39</ref> Even if Finland was regained, he thought, it would put Sweden into a new cycle of conflicts with a powerful neighbor because there was no guarantee Russia would accept the loss as final.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 181</ref> Therefore, he made up his mind to make a united [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian peninsula]], which was easier to defend, by taking Norway (intentionally without the ancient and remote provinces of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]) from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden.

This demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and the Swedish population. Sweden reluctantly declared war against Great Britain but it was treated by both countries as being merely nominal, although Swedish imports of British goods decreased from \u00a34,871 million in 1810 to \u00a3523 million in the following year.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 259</ref>\n\nIn January 1812, French troops suddenly invaded [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[island of R\u00fcgen]].<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 265</ref> The decisive reason was that Napoleon, before marching to Moscow, had to secure his rear and dared not trust a Swedish continental foothold behind him.<ref name=\"Scott, Franklin D.1988.

The construction began in 1825, but the [[Storting]] halted the funding after the costly foundation was laid and demanded that the appointed architect, [[Hans Linstow]], construct a simpler palace.

But due to flooding in the area on the 4 July 1802, they decided to move five miles to the east keeping the same margin between them and the Rio Grande. It was not until 1926 that the state government recognized Reynosa as a city.\n\nReynosa was first named ''Villa de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe de Reinosa''. The pioneers of the Villa proceeded from El Nuevo Reino de Le\u00f3n, especially from Monterrey, Cadereyta, Cerralvo and El Pil\u00f3n. The town was composed of 50 families. It was given the name of Reynosa as a tribute to the [[Reinosa|town with the same name]] in Spain, the birthplace of the [[Viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire|Viceroy]] [[Juan Francisco de G\u00fcemes, 1st Count of Revillagigedo|de G\u00fcemes y Horcasitas]].\n\n===Current===\nReynosa extends across 3,156.34 sq kilometers (1218.66 sq. miles), representing 3.7 per cent of the [[Tamaulipas]] territory.

It is also the municipal seat of [[Reynosa Municipality]].\n\nThe city is located on the southern bank of the [[Rio Grande]] in the international [[Reynosa\u2013McAllen Metropolitan Area]], directly across of the [[Mexico-U.S. border]] from [[Hidalgo, Texas]]. \n\nAs of 2013, the city of Reynosa has a population of 672,183.<ref name=\"Mexico Census\"/>   If the [[floating population]] is included in the census count, the population can reach up to approximately 1,000,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=INEGI cont\u00f3 mal en Reynosa: Alcalde|url=http://www.hoytamaulipas.net/notas/31372/INEGI-conto-mal-en-Reynosa-Alcalde.html|newspaper=Hoy Tamaulipas|date=4 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nReynosa was founded on 14 March 1749 with 297 inhabitants by Carlos Cant\u00fa under the command of [[Jos\u00e9 de Escand\u00f3n y Helguera]] the Count of [[Sierra Gorda]]. But due to flooding in the area on the 4 July 1802, they decided to move five miles to the east keeping the same margin between them and the Rio Grande. It was not until 1926 that the state government recognized Reynosa as a city.\n\nReynosa was first named ''Villa de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe de Reinosa''. The pioneers of the Villa proceeded from El Nuevo Reino de Le\u00f3n, especially from Monterrey, Cadereyta, Cerralvo and El Pil\u00f3n. The town was composed of 50 families. It was given the name of Reynosa as a tribute to the [[Reinosa|town with the same name]] in Spain, the birthplace of the [[Viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire|Viceroy]] [[Juan Francisco de G\u00fcemes, 1st Count of Revillagigedo|de G\u00fcemes y Horcasitas]].\n\n===Current===\nReynosa extends across 3,156.34 sq kilometers (1218.66 sq. miles), representing 3.7 per cent of the [[Tamaulipas]] territory.

They combined their initials to create the brand \"A&W\" and inspired a [[A&W Restaurants|restaurant chain]], also founded in 1922. Originally, A&W root beer drinks sold for five cents.<ref name=\"Keurig Dr Pepper Brands\">[http://www.drpeppersnapplegroup.com/brands/aw/ Our Brands \u2013 Keurig Dr Pepper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOutside Canada, the rights to the A&W brand are owned by [[Keurig Dr Pepper]], which in turn, licenses the brand to the similarly named U.S.-based restaurant chain; A&W products are distributed via various U.S. bottlers. [[A&W (Canada)|A&W Food Services of Canada]], which is independent of both Keurig Dr Pepper and the U.S. chain, is responsible for the restaurants and the marketing of root beer products in that country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awincomefund.ca/aboutaw/default.asp |author=A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund |title=About A&W Food Services of Canada Inc. |accessdate=2011-02-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164821/http://www.awincomefund.ca/aboutaw/default.asp |archivedate=2011-07-06 }}</ref> with retail products bottled and distributed by [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. The U.S. variant is also sold as an import drink in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Italy]] (where A&W has restaurants), as well as [[Australia]], and [[Chile]], among other countries.\n\n== History ==\n\nOn June 20, 1919, [[Roy W. Allen]] opened a roadside root beer stand in [[Lodi, California]], using a formula he had purchased from a pharmacist.<ref name=encyc>Smith, Andrew F., Encyclopedia of Junk Food and Fast Food, Greenwood Press, 2006. pp. 44\u201345.</ref> He soon opened stands in [[Stockton, California]], and five stands in nearby [[Sacramento]], home of the country's first [[drive-in]] featuring \"tray-boys\" for curbside service. In 1920, Allen became partners with Frank Wright and the two combined their initials and called their product A&W Root Beer. A mistaken notion is that the initials were derived from Alice and [[J. Willard Marriott|Willard Marriott]]. This mistake arose owing to Marriott's first business, an A&W franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gourmetrootbeer.com/history.html|title=The History of Root Beer}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Allen bought Wright's share, obtained a trademark, and began selling restaurant [[Franchising|franchises]]. A&W was one of the first franchised [[Chain store|restaurant chains]] in the United States. Franchise owners could use the A&W name and logo and purchased concentrated root beer syrup from Allen. By 1933, there were more than 170 A&W franchised outlets. There was no common menu, architecture, or procedures shared by the franchisees and some chose to sell food with the root beer.<ref name=encyc/>\n\nFranchises struggled with labor shortages and sugar rationing during [[World War II]], but following the war, the number of A&W outlets tripled as GI loans paved the way for private enterprise. Driven by the popularity of the automobile and the new mobile society, more than 450 A&W Root Beer stands were operating by 1950. In that same year, Allen retired and sold the business to [[Nebraska]]n Gene Hurtz, who formed the A&W Root Beer Company. The first A&W Root Beer outlet in Canada opened in 1956.\n\nBy 1960, the number of A&W restaurants swelled to more than 2,000. In 1963, the A&W Root Beer Company was sold to the J. Hungerford Smith Company, which had produced Allen's concentrate since 1921. In the same year, the first overseas A&W restaurant opened its doors in [[Guam]].\n\nIn 1963, the company was sold to the [[United Fruit Company]], then renamed the [[Chiquita Brands International|United Brands Company]]. In 1971, United Brands formed a wholly owned subsidiary, A&W Distributing Co., for the purpose of making A&W Root Beer available in bottles on the grocery shelf. After a test run in [[Arizona]] and California, the products were distributed nationally in the United States, along with sugar-free, low-sodium, and caffeine-free versions. In 1974, A&W introduced \"The Great Root Bear,\" a mascot that served as a goodwill ambassador for the brand.\n\nIn the late 1970s, [[A&W Restaurants]] was formed to manage restaurant franchising. It was bought in 1982 by [[A. Alfred Taubman]].\n\nThe bear and the tuba jingle that accompanied him became a long-running campaign (the tune, entitled \"Ba-Dum, Ba-Dum\", was released as a single by Attic Records, credited to \"Major Ursus\", a play on Ursa Major or \"great bear\"). The famous Canadian composer and B.C. Hall of Fame winner Robert Buckley helped compose the song. The mascot was so successful that he was eventually adopted as the mascot by the American A&W chain as well. The famous tuba jingle was played by famed Vancouver jazz, classical and session trombonist Sharman King. King also did the ads for the \"Book Warehouse\" chain of discount book stores, which he owned.\n\nIn 1986, A&W Cream Soda and A&W Diet Cream Soda were introduced and distributed nationally, followed in 1987 by the reformulation of sugar-free A&W as Diet A&W.\n\nIn October 1993, A&W Beverages was folded into [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury]] Beverages.

They combined their initials to create the brand \"A&W\" and inspired a [[A&W Restaurants|restaurant chain]], also founded in 1922. Originally, A&W root beer drinks sold for five cents.<ref name=\"Keurig Dr Pepper Brands\">[http://www.drpeppersnapplegroup.com/brands/aw/ Our Brands \u2013 Keurig Dr Pepper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOutside Canada, the rights to the A&W brand are owned by [[Keurig Dr Pepper]], which in turn, licenses the brand to the similarly named U.S.-based restaurant chain; A&W products are distributed via various U.S. bottlers. [[A&W (Canada)|A&W Food Services of Canada]], which is independent of both Keurig Dr Pepper and the U.S. chain, is responsible for the restaurants and the marketing of root beer products in that country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awincomefund.ca/aboutaw/default.asp |author=A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund |title=About A&W Food Services of Canada Inc. |accessdate=2011-02-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164821/http://www.awincomefund.ca/aboutaw/default.asp |archivedate=2011-07-06 }}</ref> with retail products bottled and distributed by [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. The U.S. variant is also sold as an import drink in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Italy]] (where A&W has restaurants), as well as [[Australia]], and [[Chile]], among other countries.\n\n== History ==\n\nOn June 20, 1919, [[Roy W. Allen]] opened a roadside root beer stand in [[Lodi, California]], using a formula he had purchased from a pharmacist.<ref name=encyc>Smith, Andrew F., Encyclopedia of Junk Food and Fast Food, Greenwood Press, 2006. pp. 44\u201345.</ref> He soon opened stands in [[Stockton, California]], and five stands in nearby [[Sacramento]], home of the country's first [[drive-in]] featuring \"tray-boys\" for curbside service. In 1920, Allen became partners with Frank Wright and the two combined their initials and called their product A&W Root Beer. A mistaken notion is that the initials were derived from Alice and [[J. Willard Marriott|Willard Marriott]]. This mistake arose owing to Marriott's first business, an A&W franchise<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gourmetrootbeer.com/history.html|title=The History of Root Beer}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Allen bought Wright's share, obtained a trademark, and began selling restaurant [[Franchising|franchises]]. A&W was one of the first franchised [[Chain store|restaurant chains]] in the United States. Franchise owners could use the A&W name and logo and purchased concentrated root beer syrup from Allen. By 1933, there were more than 170 A&W franchised outlets. There was no common menu, architecture, or procedures shared by the franchisees and some chose to sell food with the root beer.<ref name=encyc/>\n\nFranchises struggled with labor shortages and sugar rationing during [[World War II]], but following the war, the number of A&W outlets tripled as GI loans paved the way for private enterprise. Driven by the popularity of the automobile and the new mobile society, more than 450 A&W Root Beer stands were operating by 1950. In that same year, Allen retired and sold the business to [[Nebraska]]n Gene Hurtz, who formed the A&W Root Beer Company. The first A&W Root Beer outlet in Canada opened in 1956.\n\nBy 1960, the number of A&W restaurants swelled to more than 2,000. In 1963, the A&W Root Beer Company was sold to the J. Hungerford Smith Company, which had produced Allen's concentrate since 1921. In the same year, the first overseas A&W restaurant opened its doors in [[Guam]].\n\nIn 1963, the company was sold to the [[United Fruit Company]], then renamed the [[Chiquita Brands International|United Brands Company]]. In 1971, United Brands formed a wholly owned subsidiary, A&W Distributing Co., for the purpose of making A&W Root Beer available in bottles on the grocery shelf. After a test run in [[Arizona]] and California, the products were distributed nationally in the United States, along with sugar-free, low-sodium, and caffeine-free versions. In 1974, A&W introduced \"The Great Root Bear,\" a mascot that served as a goodwill ambassador for the brand.\n\nIn the late 1970s, [[A&W Restaurants]] was formed to manage restaurant franchising. It was bought in 1982 by [[A. Alfred Taubman]].\n\nThe bear and the tuba jingle that accompanied him became a long-running campaign (the tune, entitled \"Ba-Dum, Ba-Dum\", was released as a single by Attic Records, credited to \"Major Ursus\", a play on Ursa Major or \"great bear\"). The famous Canadian composer and B.C. Hall of Fame winner Robert Buckley helped compose the song. The mascot was so successful that he was eventually adopted as the mascot by the American A&W chain as well. The famous tuba jingle was played by famed Vancouver jazz, classical and session trombonist Sharman King. King also did the ads for the \"Book Warehouse\" chain of discount book stores, which he owned.\n\nIn 1986, A&W Cream Soda and A&W Diet Cream Soda were introduced and distributed nationally, followed in 1987 by the reformulation of sugar-free A&W as Diet A&W.\n\nIn October 1993, A&W Beverages was folded into [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury]] Beverages. That company would spin off its US beverages business as [[Keurig Dr Pepper]] in 2008.\n\nIn March 2005, A&W began to appear in the Vintage Bottle, a 20-ounce bottle with graphics reminiscent of an old fashioned root beer barrel. The brand's current tagline is, \"Classic American Refreshment Since 1919.\"\n\nIn July 2017, A&W Canada reformulated its root beer, dropping [[High Fructose Corn Syrup]] and some flavors from the recipe, substituting [[cane sugar]], sarsaparilla root, [[licorice]], [[birch bark]], and [[anise]].
