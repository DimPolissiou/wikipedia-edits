As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet.

He often [[Auto-Tune]]s his vocals. Others who has he impersonated multiple times include [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Michael Jackson]].

{"title_page": "Policy", "text_new": "{{distinguish-otheruses2|Police|Policy}}\n{{Selfref|For policies regarding Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:List of policies]] or kijl[[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]].}}\n{{short description|Principle or protocol to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes}}\n{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Policy}} \nA '''policy''' is a [[Deliberation|deliberate]] system of [[principle]]s to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a [[governance]] body within an organization. Policies can assist in both ''subjective'' and ''objective'' [[decision making]]. Policies to assist in subjective decision making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result are often hard to test objectively, e.g. [[work-life balance]] policy. In contrast policies to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested, e.g. password policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/legal/policy/what/index.shtml|title=What is policy|first=Publications|last=Office|date=|website=sydney.edu.au|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe term may apply to government, private sector organizations and groups, as well as individuals. [[Executive order (United States)|Presidential executive orders]], [[privacy policy|corporate privacy policies]], and parliamentary [[rules of order]] are all examples of policy. Policy differs from [[rule of law|rules]] or [[law]]. While law can compel or prohibit behaviors (e.g. a law requiring the payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve a desired outcome.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nPolicy or [[policy study]] may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have. Policies can be understood as political, [[management|managerial]], financial, and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals. In public corporate finance, a [[critical accounting policy]] is a policy for a firm/company or an industry that is considered to have a notably high subjective element, and that has a material impact on the [[financial statement]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Impact==\n\n===Intended effects===\nThe intended effects of a policy vary widely according to the organization and the context in which they are made. Broadly, policies are typically instituted to avoid some negative effect that has been noticed in the \norganization, or to seek some positive benefit. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nCorporate [[Purchasing process|purchasing policies]] provide an example of how organizations attempt to avoid negative  effects. Many large companies have policies that all purchases above a certain value must be performed through a purchasing process. By requiring this standard purchasing process through policy, the organization can limit waste and standardize the way purchasing is done. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nThe State of [[California]] provides an example of benefit-seeking policy. In recent years, the numbers of [[hybrid cars]] in California has increased dramatically, in part because of policy changes in [[Federal law]] that provided USD $1,500 in tax credits (since phased out) as well as the use of [[HOV|high-occupancy vehicle]] lanes to hybrid owners (no loew hybrid vehicles). In this case, the organization (state and/or federal government) created an effect (increased ownership and use of hybrid vehicles) through policy (tax breaks, highway lanes). {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n===Unintended effects===\nPolicies frequently have side effects or [[unintended consequences]].  Because the environments that policies seek to influence or manipulate are typically [[complex adaptive systems]] (e.g. governments, societies, large companies), making a policy change can have [[counterintuitive]] results.

A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a [[governance]] body within an organization. Policies can assist in both ''subjective'' and ''objective'' [[decision making]]. Policies to assist in subjective decision making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result are often hard to test objectively, e.g. [[work-life balance]] policy. In contrast policies to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested, e.g. password policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/legal/policy/what/index.shtml|title=What is policy|first=Publications|last=Office|date=|website=sydney.edu.au|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe term may apply to government, private sector organizations and groups, as well as individuals. [[Executive order (United States)|Presidential executive orders]], [[privacy policy|corporate privacy policies]], and parliamentary [[rules of order]] are all examples of policy. Policy differs from [[rule of law|rules]] or [[law]]. While law can compel or prohibit behaviors (e.g. a law requiring the payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve a desired outcome.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nPolicy or [[policy study]] may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have. Policies can be understood as political, [[management|managerial]], financial, and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals. In public corporate finance, a [[critical accounting policy]] is a policy for a firm/company or an industry that is considered to have a notably high subjective element, and that has a material impact on the [[financial statement]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Impact==\n\n===Intended effects===\nThe intended effects of a policy vary widely according to the organization and the context in which they are made. Broadly, policies are typically instituted to avoid some negative effect that has been noticed in the \norganization, or to seek some positive benefit. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nCorporate [[Purchasing process|purchasing policies]] provide an example of how organizations attempt to avoid negative  effects. Many large companies have policies that all purchases above a certain value must be performed through a purchasing process. By requiring this standard purchasing process through policy, the organization can limit waste and standardize the way purchasing is done. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nThe State of [[California]] provides an example of benefit-seeking policy. In recent years, the numbers of [[hybrid cars]] in California has increased dramatically, in part because of policy changes in [[Federal law]] that provided USD $1,500 in tax credits (since phased out) as well as the use of [[HOV|high-occupancy vehicle]] lanes to hybrid owners (no loew hybrid vehicles). In this case, the organization (state and/or federal government) created an effect (increased ownership and use of hybrid vehicles) through policy (tax breaks, highway lanes). {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n===Unintended effects===\nPolicies frequently have side effects or [[unintended consequences]].  Because the environments that policies seek to influence or manipulate are typically [[complex adaptive systems]] (e.g. governments, societies, large companies), making a policy change can have [[counterintuitive]] results.  For example, a government may make a policy decision to raise taxes, in hopes of increasing overall tax revenue.  Depending on the size of the tax increase, this may have the overall effect of reducing tax revenue by causing [[capital flight]] or by creating a rate so high that citizens are deterred from earning the money that is taxed.

For example, the equal opportunity policy of a company shows that the company aims to treat all its staff equally.\n\nThe actions the organization actually takes may often vary significantly from stated policy. This difference is sometimes caused by [[Horse trading|political compromise]] over policy, while in other situations it is caused by lack of policy implementation and enforcement. Implementing policy may have unexpected results, stemming from a policy whose reach extends further than the problem it was originally crafted to address. Additionally, unpredictable results may arise from selective or idiosyncratic enforcement of policy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTypes of [[policy analysis]] include: <!-- explain them!-->\n\n* Causal (resp. non-causal)\n* Deterministic (resp. stochastic, randomized and sometimes non-deterministic)\n* Index\n* Memoryless (''e.g.'', non-stationary)\n* Opportunistic (resp. non-opportunistic)\n* Stationary (resp. non-stationary)\n\nThese qualifiers can be combined, so one could, for example, have a stationary-memoryless-index policy.\n\n==Specific policy types==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Corporate governance|Company policy]]\n* Communications and [[information policy]]\n* [[Human resource policies]]\n* [[Privacy policy]]\n* [[Public policy]]\n* [[Defense policy]]\n* [[Domestic policy]]\n* [[Economic policy]]\n* [[Education policy]]\n* [[Energy policy]]\n* [[Environmental policy]]\n* [[Foreign policy]]\n* [[Forest]] policy\n* [[Health policy]]\n* [[Macroeconomic policy]]\n* [[Monetary policy]]\n* [[Plan]]\n* [[Human population control|Population policy]]\n* [[Public policy (law)|Public policy in law]]\n* [[Science policy]]\n* [[Security policy]]\n* [[Social policy]]\n* [[Urban planning|Urban policy]]\n* [[Transport policy]]\n* [[Water policy]]\n\n}}\n\n==Other uses of the term==\n* In [[enterprise architecture]] for systems design, [[policy appliances]] are technical control and logging mechanisms to enforce or reconcile policy (systems use) rules and to ensure accountability in [[information systems]].\n* In [[insurance]], policies are contracts between insurer and insured used to [[Indemnity|indemnify]] (protect) against potential loss from specified perils.

[[Saw Gerrera]], having been sent to Geonosis to investigate, deduced the Empire possesses a superweapon and resolved to discover the Death Star as depicted in the final season two-parter \"In the Name of the Rebellion.\" Though it was a dead-end, finding only scientists being abducted by the Empire, Saw learned the weapon is powered by kyber crystals taken from the Jedha system.\n\nThe [[Star Wars#Anthology films|anthology film]] ''[[Rogue One]]'' focuses on a band of Rebels stealing the plans for the first Death Star prior to the events of ''A New Hope''. The Death Star project was overseen by [[Orson Krennic]], the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military. Under Krennic's supervision, the project was beset by constant delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons designer Galen Erso (the father of Jyn Erso, the movie's main protagonist) to complete the design; nevertheless, it was another fifteen years before the Death Star was operational. The Death Star's primary laser was powered by kyber crystals mined from the desert moon of [[Jedha]], and is first used to destroy Jedha City both as a response to a violent insurgency on the planet, and as a display of the Death Star's operational status to restore the Empire's confidence in the project. Grand Moff Tarkin assumes control over the Death Star while Krennic investigates security breaches in the design project. It is subsequently revealed that Galen discreetly sabotaged the design by building a vulnerability into the reactor. This is the same vulnerability that Luke Skywalker takes advantage of during the events of ''A New Hope''. After the Death Star plans are stolen from the Scarif vault, Tarkin fires the Death Star's superlaser on the base killing Krennic, as well as Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor.<ref name=\"rogue-one-film\" /> ''Rogue One'' also reveals that the Death Star's superlaser is powered by multiple reactors, allowing it to vary its destructive power depending on the target. Skeptical of the station's power, Tarkin ordered that it first be tested on Jedha City using a single reactor. Near the end of ''Rogue One'', a second single-reactor test would destroy their installation on Scarif, along with the Rebel strike force who had successfully stolen the station's plans. This is consistent with the canon continuity in ''Star Wars'', since the destruction of the planet Alderaan would be the first time the Death Star fired the superlaser with ''all'' reactors employed so Tarkin could declare the battlestation \"fully operational\".\n\nThe canonical population of the first Death Star was 1.7 million military personnel, 400,000 maintenance droids, and 250,000 civilians/ associated contractors.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Complete Locations\"/><ref name=\"Star Wars: Death Star Battles\"/>\nThe first Death Star was defended by thousands of turbolasers, ion cannons and laser cannons, plus a complement of seven to nine thousand TIE fighters, along with tens of thousands of support craft. It also had several massive docking bays, including dry docks capable of accommodating Star Destroyers.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe 2014 book ''[[Star Wars: Tarkin]]'' detailed the life of Grand Moff Tarkin, and prominently featured the first Death Star. The theme of the construction of the Death Star is continued in the 2016 book, ''[[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel]]'', which tells the story of the development of the Death Star's superweapon by the scientist, Galen Erso and Krennic's deception of him.

[[Emperor Palpatine]] and Darth Vader send the Rebels false information that the station's weapons systems are not yet operational in order to lure the Alliance fleet into a trap, resulting in the decisive Battle of Endor. Compared to its predecessor, the second Death Star's superlaser is more advanced as it can be fired every few minutes instead of needing 24 hours to recharge, while improved targeting computers could track smaller targets such as capital ships. The unfinished battle station had been protected by a planetary shield projector deployed on the forest moon of Endor, but this was taken out by a ground assault team led by Han Solo with the help of the native [[Ewok]]s. Rebel pilots [[Wedge Antilles]] and [[Lando Calrissian]] flew into the reactor core, with Antilles in his X-wing first taking out the power regulator with proton torpedoes, and Calrissian in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' (co-piloted by [[Nien Nunb]]) striking the main reactor with concussion missiles, setting off a chain reaction that destroyed the battle station.<ref name=\"star wars 6\">{{cite AV media|people=Marquand, Richard (Director)|title=[[Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=May 25, 1983|medium=DVD|edition=2004}}</ref>\n\nAn early draft of the film featured two Death Stars at various stages of completion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-star-wars-ret-1383276948|title=10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Star Wars: Return of the Jedi|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|website=[[Gizmodo]]|date=September 25, 2013|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe second Death Star is featured in the cover of the book ''[[Star Wars: Aftermath]]'' (2015), which also features many flashbacks to the destruction of the second Death Star, as well as the events directly after its destruction.

It was constructed by Bevel Lemelisk and his engineers at the Empire's secret Maw Installation. The prototype measured 120 kilometers in diameter. Its superlaser was only powerful enough to destroy a planet's core, rendering it an uninhabitable \"dead planet\". The targeting system on the prototype was never calibrated and the superlaser was inefficient, leaving the weapon's batteries drained. The prototype had no interior except a slave-linked control room, hyperdrive engines and other components; the station operated with skeleton-crew of 75 personnel.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAlthough ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] confirmed that the plans featured in ''Attack of the Clones'' and the under-construction facility in ''Revenge of the Sith'' was the original Death Star,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} ''Star Wars: The New Essential Chronology'' [[retcon]]ned the DS-X prototype into being separate from the main Death Star.\n\n====Death Star III====\nIn the Disney attraction ''[[Star Tours - The Adventures Continue]]'', guests can travel inside an incomplete Death Star during one of the randomized ride sequences. In the original Star Tours, a '''''Death Star III''''' is seen and destroyed during the ride sequence by the New Republic. [[Leland Chee]] originally created the third Death Star to explain why a Death Star is present on the ''[[Star Tours]]'' ride when both of the stations in the movies were destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/convenient-daily-departures-the-history-of-star-tours|title=Convenient Daily Departures: The History of Star Tours - StarWars.com|date=22 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> The station being built near the Forest Moon of Endor like the second Death Star before. It is similar to an original concept for ''Return of the Jedi'', where two Death Stars would have been built near Had Abbadon (then the Imperial capital world). The ''Habitation'' spheres, based on the Imperials' suspicious claims that they were designed strictly for peaceful purposes, were suggested by some fans to have been the origin for the Death Star III. This was later revealed to be the case in Part 2 of the StarWars.com Blog series ''The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire''. In the ''Legends'' game ''[[Star Wars: Tiny Death Star]]'', a random HoloNet entry states that one of the residents of the Death Star is simply staying there until he can afford to stay at the third Death Star.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n====Other superweapons====\nA prototype version of the Death Star can be found in Kevin J.

The prototype was ineffective, missing its target and instead destroying an Imperial garrison moon the sole time it was fired in combat. After this, the prototype was later destroyed when it was led into the black holes of the cluster.\n\nIn the original Marvel [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|''Star Wars'' comic series]], a superweapon called \"The Tarkin\" is built. It is described as being similar to the Death Star but with more energy. Darth Vader commands it and Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, {{nowrap|C-3PO}}, and R2-D2 sabotage it with Lando's help. It is finally destroyed by an Imperial officer attempting to use an ionic weapon to both attack the escaping Rebels and assassinate Vader.\n\nIn the ''[[Dark Empire]]'' comic series (1991\u201395), the reborn Emperor Palpatine's flagships ''Eclipse'' and ''Eclipse II'' Super Star Destroyers (Star Dreadnoughts) have a miniaturized version of the Death Star superlaser.<ref>https://www.theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/saxton.asp</ref> The first ''Eclipse'' was under construction at the time of the Emperor's death at Endor; shortly thereafter, it was briefly captured by pirates, who quickly abandoned it as an obvious target for the Rebels. The vessel was retrieved by remnants of the Empire and completed, and later served as the flagship of the resurrected Palpatine. It was destroyed by a Force storm enhanced by Luke and Leia, who had been brought aboard by the Emperor in hopes that they could be converted to the dark side. The ''Eclipse II'' was mostly identical to its predecessor save for a handful of visual changes, and fulfilled the same purpose. It was later destroyed when an errant projectile from the destroyed Galaxy Gun, another superweapon developed under the returned Palpatine, fell onto the ship and caused a massive explosion that destroyed not only the ship and its accompanying fleet, but also the nearby Imperial citadel of [[Byss]].\n\nIn Kevin J. Anderson's novel ''[[Darksaber (novel)|Darksaber]]'' (1995), Death Star designer Bevel Lemelisk is recruited by the Hutts to build a superlaser weapon. Due to their refusal to sufficiently fund and supply the project, the resultant 'superweapon' is quickly destroyed by a combination of the tumultuous Hoth asteroid field in which it was built and the efforts of the New Republic.

To mark the Death Star being fully operational, Tarkin orders the Death Star to destroy Leia's home world of [[Alderaan]] in an attempt to press her into giving him the location of the secret Rebel headquarters; she gives them the location of [[Dantooine]] which housed a now-deserted Rebel base, but Tarkin has Alderaan destroyed anyway as a demonstration of the Empire's resolve. Later, [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[C-3PO]], and [[R2-D2]] are pulled aboard the station by a [[tractor beam]], where they discover and manage to rescue Princess Leia.

(Director)|title=[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|date=December 18, 2015}}</ref> (The Planet Ilum)\n\nIn the animated series ''Star Wars Rebels'', the two-part episode \"Ghost of Geonosis\" hinted that the Geonosians were nearly wiped out to extinction out of the Empire's need for secrecy. [[Saw Gerrera]], having been sent to Geonosis to investigate, deduced the Empire possesses a superweapon and resolved to discover the Death Star as depicted in the final season two-parter \"In the Name of the Rebellion.\" Though it was a dead-end, finding only scientists being abducted by the Empire, Saw learned the weapon is powered by kyber crystals taken from the Jedha system.\n\nThe [[Star Wars#Anthology films|anthology film]] ''[[Rogue One]]'' focuses on a band of Rebels stealing the plans for the first Death Star prior to the events of ''A New Hope''. The Death Star project was overseen by Orson Krennic, the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military. Under Krennic's supervision, the project was beset by constant delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons designer Galen Erso (the father of Jyn Erso, the movie's main protagonist) to complete the design; nevertheless, it was another fifteen years before the Death Star was operational. The Death Star's primary laser was powered by kyber crystals mined from the desert moon of [[Jedha]], and is first used to destroy Jedha City both as a response to a violent insurgency on the planet, and as a display of the Death Star's operational status to restore the Empire's confidence in the project. Grand Moff Tarkin assumes control over the Death Star while Krennic investigates security breaches in the design project. It is subsequently revealed that Galen discreetly sabotaged the design by building a vulnerability into the reactor. This is the same vulnerability that Luke Skywalker takes advantage of during the events of ''A New Hope''. After the Death Star plans are stolen from the Scarif vault, Tarkin fires the Death Star's superlaser on the base killing Krennic, as well as Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor.<ref name=\"rogue-one-film\" /> ''Rogue One'' also reveals that the Death Star's superlaser is powered by multiple reactors, allowing it to vary its destructive power depending on the target. Skeptical of the station's power, Tarkin ordered that it first be tested on Jedha City using a single reactor. Near the end of ''Rogue One'', a second single-reactor test would destroy their installation on Scarif, along with the Rebel strike force who had successfully stolen the station's plans. This is consistent with the canon continuity in ''Star Wars'', since the destruction of the planet Alderaan would be the first time the Death Star fired the superlaser with ''all'' reactors employed so Tarkin could declare the battlestation \"fully operational\".\n\nThe canonical population of the first Death Star was 1.7 million military personnel, 400,000 maintenance droids, and 250,000 civilians/ associated contractors.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Complete Locations\"/><ref name=\"Star Wars: Death Star Battles\"/>\nThe first Death Star was defended by thousands of turbolasers, ion cannons and laser cannons, plus a complement of seven to nine thousand TIE fighters, along with tens of thousands of support craft. It also had several massive docking bays, including dry docks capable of accommodating Star Destroyers.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe 2014 book ''[[Star Wars: Tarkin]]'' detailed the life of Grand Moff Tarkin, and prominently featured the first Death Star. The theme of the construction of the Death Star is continued in the 2016 book, ''[[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel]]'', which tells the story of the development of the Death Star's superweapon by the scientist, Galen Erso and Krennic's deception of him.

[[Emperor Palpatine]] and Darth Vader send the Rebels false information that the station's weapons systems are not yet operational in order to lure the Alliance fleet into a trap, resulting in the decisive Battle of Endor. Compared to its predecessor, the second Death Star's superlaser is more advanced as it can be fired every few minutes instead of needing 24 hours to recharge, while improved targeting computers could track smaller targets such as capital ships. The unfinished battle station had been protected by a planetary shield projector deployed on the forest moon of Endor, but this was taken out by a ground assault team led by Han Solo with the help of the native [[Ewok]]s. Rebel pilots [[Wedge Antilles]] and [[Lando Calrissian]] flew into the reactor core, with Antilles in his X-wing first taking out the power regulator with proton torpedoes, and Calrissian in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' (co-piloted by [[Nien Nunb]]) striking the main reactor with concussion missiles, setting off a chain reaction that destroyed the battle station.<ref name=\"star wars 6\">{{cite AV media|people=Marquand, Richard (Director)|title=[[Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=May 25, 1983|medium=DVD|edition=2004}}</ref>\n\nAn early draft of the film featured two Death Stars at various stages of completion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-star-wars-ret-1383276948|title=10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Star Wars: Return of the Jedi|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|website=[[Gizmodo]]|date=September 25, 2013|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe second Death Star is featured in the cover of the book ''[[Star Wars: Aftermath]]'' (2015), which also features many flashbacks to the destruction of the second Death Star, as well as the events directly after its destruction.

In the ''Legends'' game ''[[Star Wars: Tiny Death Star]]'', a random HoloNet entry states that one of the residents of the Death Star is simply staying there until he can afford to stay at the third Death Star.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n====Other superweapons====\nA prototype version of the Death Star can be found in Kevin J. Anderson's novel ''[[Jedi Search]]'' (1994).<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Kevin J.|title=Jedi Search|year=1994|isbn=0-553-29798-8|page=271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSbTCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA271}}</ref> It was kept at the Maw Installation, an Imperial research institute in a cluster of black holes, and later deployed by Tol Sivron after the Maw Installation was invaded by the New Republic. The prototype was ineffective, missing its target and instead destroying an Imperial garrison moon the sole time it was fired in combat. After this, the prototype was later destroyed when it was led into the black holes of the cluster.\n\nIn the original Marvel [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|''Star Wars'' comic series]], a superweapon called \"The Tarkin\" is built. It is described as being similar to the Death Star but with more energy. Darth Vader commands it and Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, {{nowrap|C-3PO}}, and R2-D2 sabotage it with Lando's help. It is finally destroyed by an Imperial officer attempting to use an ionic weapon to both attack the escaping Rebels and assassinate Vader.\n\nIn the ''[[Dark Empire]]'' comic series (1991\u201395), the reborn Emperor Palpatine's flagships ''Eclipse'' and ''Eclipse II'' Super Star Destroyers (Star Dreadnoughts) have a miniaturized version of the Death Star superlaser.<ref>https://www.theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/saxton.asp</ref> The first ''Eclipse'' was under construction at the time of the Emperor's death at Endor; shortly thereafter, it was briefly captured by pirates, who quickly abandoned it as an obvious target for the Rebels. The vessel was retrieved by remnants of the Empire and completed, and later served as the flagship of the resurrected Palpatine. It was destroyed by a Force storm enhanced by Luke and Leia, who had been brought aboard by the Emperor in hopes that they could be converted to the dark side. The ''Eclipse II'' was mostly identical to its predecessor save for a handful of visual changes, and fulfilled the same purpose. It was later destroyed when an errant projectile from the destroyed Galaxy Gun, another superweapon developed under the returned Palpatine, fell onto the ship and caused a massive explosion that destroyed not only the ship and its accompanying fleet, but also the nearby Imperial citadel of [[Byss]].\n\nIn Kevin J. Anderson's novel ''[[Darksaber (novel)|Darksaber]]'' (1995), Death Star designer Bevel Lemelisk is recruited by the Hutts to build a superlaser weapon. Due to their refusal to sufficiently fund and supply the project, the resultant 'superweapon' is quickly destroyed by a combination of the tumultuous Hoth asteroid field in which it was built and the efforts of the New Republic. Lemelisk is captured and incarcerated by the Republic, and is later executed for his hand in the design and construction of Imperial superweapons.\n\nThe novel ''[[Children of the Jedi]]'' (1995) involves the return of ''Eye of Palpatine'', a \"colossal, asteroid-shaped\" super dreadnaught constructed at the behest of Emperor Palpatine during the second year of the Galactic Civil War. The Imperials lost control of the ''Eye'' when a Jedi used the Force to hijack the main computer with their spirits.\n\nIn [[Sonic The Hedgehog 2]], Dr. Eggman  constructs the \"Death Egg\" as a version of the Death Star for Sonic.\n\n==Cultural influence==\n{{Main|Cultural impact of Star Wars}}\nThe Death Star placed ninth in a 2008 [[20th Century Fox]] poll of the most popular movie weapons.<ref>{{cite news | author = Sophie Borland | title = Lightsabre wins the battle of movie weapons | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | date = 2008-01-21 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1576154/Lightsabre-wins-the-battle-of-movie-weapons.html | accessdate=2015-04-16 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nIt has been referred to outside of the ''Star Wars'' context in such examples as:\n\n* [[AT&T Corporation]]'s logo introduced in 1982 is [[AT&T Information Systems|informally referred to as the \"Death Star\"]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatriceco.com/bti/porticus/bell/bell_logos.html |title=Bell System Memorial- Bell Logo History |website= beatriceco.com|publisher=Porticus.org |date= |accessdate=January 13, 2018|quote=  sterling silver American Bell logo (which we recognize as the post-divestiture AT&T \"death star\" logo)}}</ref> ''[[Ars Technica]]'' referred to \"the AT&T Death Star\" in an article criticizing a company data policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/att-have-you-no-shame/2/|page=2|title=AT&T, have you no shame?|first=Nate|last=Anderson|date=2012-08-23|accessdate=2012-08-23|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications]]|work=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref> Competitor [[T-Mobile]] mocked AT&T's \"Death Star\" logo and \"Empire-like reputation\" in a press release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consumerist.com/2014/01/29/t-mobile-claims-att-dismantles-death-star-in-mocking-press-release/|title=T-Mobile Claims \"AT&T Dismantles Death Star\" In Mocking Press Release|first=Chris|last=Morran|date=January 29, 2014|accessdate=January 29, 2014|work=[[The Consumerist]]|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]}}</ref>\n* In [[Kevin Smith]]'s first feature film, ''[[Clerks]]'' (1994), one of the main characters points out that many independent contractors would have been killed in the second Death Star's destruction.<ref>{{cite web |last=White |first=Brett |title='Clerks' Changed the Way We Talk About Pop Culture with Its Iconic 'Star Wars' Convo |url=https://decider.com/2018/08/02/clerks-star-wars-contractors-kevin-smith/ |website=Decider |accessdate=September 13, 2019 |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[KTCK (AM)|KTCK]] (SportsRadio 1310 The Ticket) in Dallas were the first to use the term \"Death Star\" to describe the new mammoth Cowboys Stadium, now [[AT&T Stadium]], in [[Arlington, Texas]].

The name is thought to refer to a pool gate or gap in a cliff where pools of water are found, often allowing swimmers to jump in. The cliffs of the [[Isle of Thanet]] are composed of chalk, a fossil-bearing rock.\n\nMargate gives its name to the relatively unknown yet influential [[Battle of Margate]], starting on 24 March 1387, it was the last major [[Naval warfare|naval battle]] of the [[Caroline War]] phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Despite the battle being named after Margate, very little actually happened near the coastal town - the battle is named after Margate as this was where an [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of 51 [[Naval vessel|vessels]] that was anchored at Margate [[Roadstead]] first spotted a [[Kingdom of France|Franco]]-[[Crown of Castile|Castilian]]-[[County of Flanders|Flemish]] [[wine]] [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of around 250-360 [[Marine vessel|vessels]]. The English gave chase after the undermanned wine fleet and finally defeated the fleet a day later on the 25 March 1387 off the coast of [[Cadzand]], [[Zeeland]], [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe town's history is tied closely to the sea and it has a proud maritime tradition. Margate was a \"limb\" of [[Dover]] in the ancient confederation of the [[Cinque Port|Cinque ports]]. It was added to the confederation in the 15th century. Margate has been a leading seaside resort for at least 250&nbsp;years. Like its neighbour [[Ramsgate]], it has been a traditional holiday destination for [[London]]ers drawn to its sandy beaches. Margate had a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] jetty which was largely destroyed by a [[1978 North Sea storm surge|storm in 1978]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://piers.org.uk/pierpages/NPSmargate.html|title=National Piers Society ''(retrieved 6 January 2011)''|access-date=6 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824114827/http://piers.org.uk/pierpages/NPSmargate.html|archive-date=24 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLike [[Brighton]] and [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend]], Margate was infamous for gang violence between [[mods and rockers]] in the 1960s, and [[Mod (subculture)|mods]] and [[skinheads]] in the 1980s.<ref>There is an unflattering portrait of skinheads and a [[Cockney]]fied Margate in [[Paul Theroux]], ''The Kingdom by the Sea'', 1983:24-26.</ref>\n\nThe [[Turner Contemporary]] art gallery occupies a prominent position next to the harbour.

Turner described the Thanet skies as the \"loveliest in all Europe.\" In 1994 Crofts became increasingly determined to create such a gallery and in 1998 the Leader of [[Kent County Council]] met a number of people from the art world to discuss the idea. They hoped that the centre would regenerate the once-thriving town of Margate and offer an alternative to Margate's traditional tourist trade. In the late 1990s, the County Council offered to fund the building of the Turner Gallery. Additional funding was contributed by the [[Arts Council England]] and [[South East England Development Agency]]. In 2001 the Turner Contemporary was officially established. The view from the gallery is similar to that seen by Turner from his lodging house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-13013824|title=Margate's Turner Contemporary art gallery set to open|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> The site initially proposed formed part of the harbour itself, but some critics questioned the prudence of placing part of Britain's national art treasures in a spot that was exposed to the full fury of the [[North Sea]]. To reduce the cost, [[Thanet District Council]] chose a new site inland from the harbour wall. The scheme was supported by the artist [[Tracey Emin]], who was brought up in Margate. The building itself was designed by [[David Chipperfield Architects]] after the abandonment of the design by Sn\u00f8hetta + Spence architects. Building work started in 2008 but the project's initiator, John Crofts, died in 2009. The Turner Contemporary Gallery officially opened on 16 April 2011. It is hoped the gallery will help regenerate the town in the same way [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] has benefited from the introduction of the [[Tate Gallery]].\n\nAcross the road from the gallery in Margate Old Town there is a community of independent shops. Accessed from the seafront via Market Street, Duke Street and King Street this area is clustered around the Old Town Hall and Market Place. There is also a small museum in the Market Place which provides information about the history of Margate. In 2012 Margate was chosen as one of the towns to benefit from the Portas Pilot Scheme aimed at regenerating some of Britain's run-down High Streets.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[File:Draper's mill.jpg|thumb|[[Draper's Mill, Margate|Draper's Mill]]]]\n\n===Films===\n[[J.

The name is thought to refer to a pool gate or gap in a cliff where pools of water are found, often allowing swimmers to jump in. The cliffs of the [[Isle of Thanet]] are composed of chalk, a fossil-bearing rock.\n\nMargate gives its name to the relatively unknown yet influential [[Battle of Margate]], starting on 24 March 1387, it was the last major [[Naval warfare|naval battle]] of the [[Caroline War]] phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Despite the battle being named after Margate, very little actually happened near the coastal town - the battle is named after Margate as this was where an [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of 51 [[Naval vessel|vessels]] that was anchored at Margate [[Roadstead]] first spotted a [[Kingdom of France|Franco]]-[[Crown of Castile|Castilian]]-[[County of Flanders|Flemish]] [[wine]] [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of around 250-360 [[Marine vessel|vessels]]. The English gave chase after the undermanned wine fleet and finally defeated the fleet a day later on the 25 March 1387 off the coast of [[Cadzand]], [[Zeeland]], [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe town's history is tied closely to the sea and it has a proud maritime tradition. Margate was a \"limb\" of [[Dover]] in the ancient confederation of the [[Cinque Port|Cinque ports]]. It was added to the confederation in the 15th century. Margate has been a leading seaside resort for at least 250&nbsp;years. Like its neighbour [[Ramsgate]], it has been a traditional holiday destination for [[London]]ers drawn to its sandy beaches. Margate had a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] jetty which was largely destroyed by a [[1978 North Sea storm surge|storm in 1978]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://piers.org.uk/pierpages/NPSmargate.html|title=National Piers Society ''(retrieved 6 January 2011)''|access-date=6 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824114827/http://piers.org.uk/pierpages/NPSmargate.html|archive-date=24 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLike [[Brighton]] and [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend]], Margate was infamous for gang violence between [[mods and rockers]] in the 1960s, and [[Mod (subculture)|mods]] and [[skinheads]] in the 1980s.<ref>There is an unflattering portrait of skinheads and a [[Cockney]]fied Margate in [[Paul Theroux]], ''The Kingdom by the Sea'', 1983:24-26.</ref>\n\nThe [[Turner Contemporary]] art gallery occupies a prominent position next to the harbour.

This was abolished in 1974, since which date Margate has been part of the [[Thanet District|Thanet]] district of [[Kent]]. The town contains the seven electoral [[Ward (politics)|wards]] of Margate Central, [[Cliftonville]] West, Cliftonville East (both Cliftonville wards were formally [[Margate Cliftonville]] from 1973 to 2003), Westbrook, Garlinge, Dane Valley and Salmestone.

Turner described the Thanet skies as the \"loveliest in all Europe.\" In 1994 Crofts became increasingly determined to create such a gallery and in 1998 the Leader of [[Kent County Council]] met a number of people from the art world to discuss the idea. They hoped that the centre would regenerate the once-thriving town of Margate and offer an alternative to Margate's traditional tourist trade. In the late 1990s, the County Council offered to fund the building of the Turner Gallery. Additional funding was contributed by the [[Arts Council England]] and [[South East England Development Agency]]. In 2001 the Turner Contemporary was officially established. The view from the gallery is similar to that seen by Turner from his lodging house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-13013824|title=Margate's Turner Contemporary art gallery set to open|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> The site initially proposed formed part of the harbour itself, but some critics questioned the prudence of placing part of Britain's national art treasures in a spot that was exposed to the full fury of the [[North Sea]]. To reduce the cost, [[Thanet District Council]] chose a new site inland from the harbour wall. The scheme was supported by the artist [[Tracey Emin]], who was brought up in Margate. The building itself was designed by [[David Chipperfield Architects]] after the abandonment of the design by Sn\u00f8hetta + Spence architects. Building work started in 2008 but the project's initiator, John Crofts, died in 2009. The Turner Contemporary Gallery officially opened on 16 April 2011. It is hoped the gallery will help regenerate the town in the same way [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] has benefited from the introduction of the [[Tate Gallery]].\n\nAcross the road from the gallery in Margate Old Town there is a community of independent shops. Accessed from the seafront via Market Street, Duke Street and King Street this area is clustered around the Old Town Hall and Market Place. There is also a small museum in the Market Place which provides information about the history of Margate. In 2012 Margate was chosen as one of the towns to benefit from the Portas Pilot Scheme aimed at regenerating some of Britain's run-down High Streets.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[File:Draper's mill.jpg|thumb|[[Draper's Mill, Margate|Draper's Mill]]]]\n\n===Films===\n[[J.
