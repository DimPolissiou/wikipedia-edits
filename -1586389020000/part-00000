They introduced Edmondson to several artist friends, including Starr's boyhood friend Meyer (Mike) Wolfe and his wife [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]]. Dahl-Wolfe was a photographer who had recently begun work for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' fashion magazine in [[New York City|New York]]. She made over a hundred of photographs of Edmondson's at work in his backyard shop, which she presented to the editor of Harper's Bazaar''.'' She attempted to publish his work but newspaper chain mogul [[William Randolph Hearst]], had a prejudice against showing Negro art as he seen them as nothing other than servants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/william-edmondson-down-home-artist-forging-beauty-stone|title=William Edmondson, a down home artist forging beauty from stone|work=aaregistry.org|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" /> She then brought Edmondson's work to the attention of fellow Tennessean Thomas Mabry and his boss [[Alfred Barr]], the director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA)<ref name=\":1\" />.    \n\nEdmondson's career lasted for about fifteen years. His work never commanded large sums during his lifetime. In 1939 and again in 1941, he worked under the [[Works Progress Administration]], a government-sponsored relief program that included artists. In the late 1940s, his health began to fail and his artistic production slowed. Edmondson professed to be uninterested in fame, and he appears to have struggled financially for the final years of his life. He is believed to have created about 300 works during his working lifetime.  \n\n== Exhibitions ==\n[[File:Bird_ca._1937.jpg|alt=|thumb|291x291px|Bird ca. 1937, carved limestone, gift from Margaret Z. Robson]]\nEdmondson was given a one-man show, the first by an African American artist, at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] from October 20 to December 1, 1937.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1938, through MoMA's influence, William Edmondson's sculpture was included in the \"Three Centuries of Art in the United States\" in [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Interest in his work on the national and international stage was short-lived, and he was viewed primarily as a novelty, or exemplar of the \"primitive\" race-memory of an untutored, naive old Negro stone carver. Locally, Alfred Starr continued to promote Edmondson's work to his artistic friends and acquaintances, who bought work directly from Edmondson's \"sculpture yard\" or through the local Lyzon Gallery. Starr introduced the famed modernist photographer [[Edward Weston]] to Edmondson in 1941, and Weston made several striking photographs of Edmondson at work in his shop and yard. Also in 1941, he received the only other solo show accorded during his lifetime, at the Nashville Art Gallery. \n\nAfter very sporadic exhibition through the 1950s and 1960s (mostly as part of \"folk art\" exhibits), collector [[Edmund Fuller]] wrote a biography of Edmondson which was published in 1973. His sculpture was included in the influential \"[[Two Centuries of Black American Art]]\" exhibition curated by [[Fisk University]] Art Department chairman [[David Driskell]] in 1976.  In 1981 the new [[Tennessee State Museum]] opened with a permanent solo exhibition with six of Edmondson's sculptures featuring loaned sculptures from Elizabeth Starr's personal collection<ref name=\":1\" />, and the essays in the accompanying catalog sought to elevate appreciation of Edmondson's work as fine art. Through the 1980s and 1990s Edmondson's sculptures were exhibited extensively, though often in the limiting context of the labels \"outsider\", \"folk art\", \"self-taught\", and \"naive\". In 1999, Nashville's [[Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art|Cheekwood Museum of Art]] mounted a major traveling retrospective exhibition and catalog that included in-depth biographical and critical essays on his life and work This exhibit also sculptures from Elizabeth Starrs personal collection of which she donated to the museum.<ref name=\":1\" /> A 2006 exhibition, \"William Edmondson, Bill Traylor, and the Modernist Impulse,\" paired Edmondson with another well-known self-taught artist and argued for Edmondson's acceptance as an artist without limiting labels. This exhibit displayed twenty-one of Edmondson's sculptures which is the largest collection of Edmondson's art in the country.<ref name=\":4\" /> In 2016 the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] received one of its largest gifts of folk art work from Margaret Z. Robson, among them were three of Edmondson's sculptures<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/smithsonian-american-art-museum-acquires-major-collection-self-taught-american-art|title=Smithsonian American Art Museum Acquires Major Collection of Self-Taught American Art|last=Baptiste|first=Laura|date=December 13, 2016|website=Smithsonian|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \n\nEdmondson's art is displayed permanently at the [[The Newark Museum of Art]],  [[American Folk Art Museum]], the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], the [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the Montclair Museum in New Jersey<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\n== Legacy ==\nOn August 20, 2014, Mayor [[Karl Dean]] opened Nashville's first arts park, named in Edmondson's honor. The park, managed by the Nashville Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency, includes sculptures by [[Thornton Dial]] and [[Lonnie Holley]] inspired by the work of William Edmondson. The park is located in a traditionally African-American neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edmondson Park dedication officially opens city's first arts park |url=http://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/3178/Edmondson-Park-dedication-officially-opens-citys-first-arts-park.aspx |website=Nashville.gov |publisher=Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |date=August 20, 2014}}</ref>  Even though the site of Edmondson's house at 1434 Fourteenth Avenue South is now a public school, it has been officially recognized with a Tennessee historical marker.<ref name=\":1\" /> About a few miles away, some of Edmondson's tombstones are on display at a local cemetery.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nSince his death, Edmondson's work has gradually come to be highly appreciated by critics and collectors, and his sculptures garner up to $70,000-$300,000 at auction<ref name=\":4\" />.

They introduced Edmondson to several artist friends, including Starr's boyhood friend Meyer (Mike) Wolfe and his wife [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]]. Dahl-Wolfe was a photographer who had recently begun work for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' fashion magazine in [[New York City|New York]]. She made over a hundred of photographs of Edmondson's at work in his backyard shop, which she presented to the editor of Harper's Bazaar''.'' She attempted to publish his work but newspaper chain mogul [[William Randolph Hearst]], had a prejudice against showing Negro art as he seen them as nothing other than servants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/william-edmondson-down-home-artist-forging-beauty-stone|title=William Edmondson, a down home artist forging beauty from stone|work=aaregistry.org|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" /> She then brought Edmondson's work to the attention of fellow Tennessean Thomas Mabry and his boss [[Alfred Barr]], the director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA)<ref name=\":1\" />.    \n\nEdmondson's career lasted for about fifteen years. His work never commanded large sums during his lifetime. In 1939 and again in 1941, he worked under the [[Works Progress Administration]], a government sponsored relief program that included artists. In the late 1940s, his health began to fail and his artistic production slowed. Edmondson professed to be uninterested in fame, and he appears to have struggled financially for the final years of his life. He is believed to have created about 300 works during his working lifetime.  \n\n== Exhibitions ==\n[[File:Bird_ca._1937.jpg|alt=|thumb|291x291px|Bird ca. 1937, carved limestone, gift from Margaret Z. Robson]]\nEdmondson was given a one-man show, the first by an African American artist, at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] from October 20th to December 1st 1937<ref name=\":1\" />. In 1938, through MoMA's influence, William Edmondson's sculpture was included in the \"Three Centuries of Art in the United States\" in [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Interest in his work on the national and international stage was short-lived, and he was viewed primarily as a novelty, or exemplar of the \"primitive\" race-memory of an untutored, naive old Negro stone carver. Locally, Alfred Starr continued to promote Edmondson's work to his artistic friends and acquaintances, who bought work directly from Edmondson's \"sculpture yard\" or through the local Lyzon Gallery. Starr introduced the famed modernist photographer [[Edward Weston]] to Edmondson in 1941, and Weston made several striking photographs of Edmondson at work in his shop and yard. Also in 1941, he received the only other solo show accorded during his lifetime, at the Nashville Art Gallery. \n\nAfter very sporadic exhibition through the 1950s and 1960s (mostly as part of \"folk art\" exhibits), collector [[Edmund Fuller]] wrote a biography of Edmondson which was published in 1973. His sculpture was included in the influential \"[[Two Centuries of Black American Art]]\" exhibition curated by [[Fisk University]] Art Department chairman [[David Driskell]] in 1976.  In 1981 the new [[Tennessee State Museum]] opened with a permanent solo exhibition with six of Edmondson's sculptures featuring loaned sculptures from Elizabeth Starr's personal collection<ref name=\":1\" />, and the essays in the accompanying catalog sought to elevate appreciation of Edmondson's work as fine art. Through the 1980s and 1990s Edmondson's sculptures were exhibited extensively, though often in the limiting context of the labels \"outsider\", \"folk art\", \"self-taught\", and \"naive\". In 1999, Nashville's [[Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art|Cheekwood Museum of Art]] mounted a major traveling retrospective exhibition and catalog that included in-depth biographical and critical essays on his life and work This exhibit also sculptures from Elizabeth Starrs personal collection of which she donated to the museum.<ref name=\":1\" /> A 2006 exhibition, \"William Edmondson, Bill Traylor, and the Modernist Impulse,\" paired Edmondson with another well-known self-taught artist and argued for Edmondson's acceptance as an artist without limiting labels. This exhibit displeayed twenty-one of Edmondon's sculptures which is the largest collection of Edmondson's art in the country<ref name=\":4\" />. In 2016 the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] received one of its largest gifts of folk art work from Margaret Z. Robson, among them were three of Edmondson's sculptures<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/smithsonian-american-art-museum-acquires-major-collection-self-taught-american-art|title=Smithsonian American Art Museum Acquires Major Collection of Self-Taught American Art|last=Baptiste|first=Laura|date=December 13, 2016|website=Smithsonian|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \n\nEdmondson's art is displayed permanently at the [[The Newark Museum of Art]],  [[American Folk Art Museum]], the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], the [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the Montclair Musuem in New Jersey<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\n== Legacy ==\nOn August 20, 2014, Mayor [[Karl Dean]] opened Nashville's first arts park, named in Edmondson's honor. The park, managed by the Nashville Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency, includes sculptures by [[Thornton Dial]] and [[Lonnie Holley]] inspired by the work of William Edmondson. The park is located in a traditionally African-American neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edmondson Park dedication officially opens city's first arts park |url=http://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/3178/Edmondson-Park-dedication-officially-opens-citys-first-arts-park.aspx |website=Nashville.gov |publisher=Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |date=August 20, 2014}}</ref>  Even though the site of Edmondson's house at 1434 Fourteenth Avenue South is now a public school, it has been officially recognized with a Tennessee historical marker.<ref name=\":1\" /> About a few miles away, some of Edmondson's tombstones are on display at a local cemetery.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nSince his death, Edmondson's work has gradually come to be highly appreciated by critics and collectors, and his sculptures garner up to $70,000-$300,000 at auction<ref name=\":4\" />.

It was sponsored by [[Procter & Gamble]] in its Sunday night, 8:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time period. The series is set in the post Civil War old west. The show starred [[Chuck Connors]] as Jason McCord, a [[United States Army]] [[cavalry]] [[Captain (land)|captain]] who had been [[court-martialed]] and [[Drumming out|drummed out]] of the service following an unjust accusation of [[cowardice]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Chuck Connors Branded 1965.JPG|thumb|180px|left|McCord leaving the fort as the gates close behind him]]\nThe opening title credits of each episode in the series feature a depiction of McCord's [[cashiering]] and [[drumming out]] of the military.  He is then sent out of the fort where this ceremony occurred, and the gates are closed behind him. Although the exact date of McCord's cashiering is never given, events and people depicted in episodes place the events of the series itself as sometime during the first administration of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (1869\u201372) and after [[William Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska purchase]]. The name and location of the fort are also not given; but since [[Bitter Creek (Wyoming)|Bitter Creek]], where the battle that caused McCord's discharge took place, is in southern [[Wyoming]], the location of the fort is presumably within what was in 1869 the [[Wyoming Territory]]. U.S. military forts known to be in operation at that time in the territory included [[Fort Bridger]], [[Fort Fetterman]] and [[Fort Laramie]].\n\nIn the pilot episode, \"The Vindicator,\" McCord is confronted by a newspaper reporter ([[Claude Akins]]) who wants a follow-up story on the Bitter Creek massacre. McCord refuses to cooperate. He knows that General James Reed, McCord's mentor, was on a peace mission to meet representatives of the Cheyenne nation at Bitter Creek. His unit of 31 men was attacked by a group of renegade Indians known as [[Dog Soldiers]]. During the attack, McCord realized that the old general had taken leave of his senses. McCord assumed command, but it was too late. McCord was wounded in the battle and left for dead, the only survivor. He remained in a coma for 10 days after the attack. McCord was later charged with desertion, convicted at court-martial, and cashiered out of the Army.\n\nThe reporter tracks down a widow of the Bitter Creek massacre ([[June Lockhart]]). Her husband was third in command and had written several letters questioning Reed's mental state. Those letters would have been enough to grant McCord a new trial and possibly exonerate him, but McCord convinced the widow to burn the letters to protect Reed's reputation. McCord feared that if Reed's reputation were <!-- subjunctive --> damaged, certain people in Washington, DC, would try to start a new war with the Apaches. McCord chose never to speak about what really happened at Bitter Creek.\n\nMcCord retained the handle of his broken saber with attached [[pommel (sword)|pommel]]. He had the remaining blade sharpened into a long knife, which he used in many episodes. He traveled throughout the [[Old West]], continually confronted by people who refused to believe his innocence, requiring him to prove them wrong.\n\n[[John Pickard (American actor)|John M. Pickard]] appeared in six episodes as General [[Phil Sheridan]]. Other notable guest stars included [[Chris Alcaide]], [[Russ Conway (actor)|Russ Conway]], [[Don Collier]], [[Burgess Meredith]], [[John Carradine]], [[Pat Conway]], [[Alex Cord]], [[Janet De Gore]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], [[Chad Everett]], [[I. Stanford Jolley]], [[Martin Landau]], [[June Lockhart]], [[Gregg Palmer]], [[Larry Pennell]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Lee Van Cleef]], [[Bruce Dern]], and [[Michael Rennie]].\n\n==Production==\nCreated by [[Larry Cohen]], the show was co-produced for most of its run by [[Goodson-Todman Productions|Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions]] in association with Sentinel Productions, Inc. Goodson-Todman was primarily known for game and panel shows such as ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', and ''[[Match Game]]''; those are under [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]] now. Present-day U.S. rights to ''Branded'' came into the ownership of [[King World]] before it became [[CBS Television Distribution]]. Many stations that carry ''Branded'' today usually schedule the program alongside others about drifters in the Old West including [[Aaron Spelling]]'s ''[[The Guns of Will Sonnett]]'', which starred [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Dack Rambo]]; as with ''Branded'', King World / CBS also distributed ''Will Sonnett'' in syndication.\n\nParts of the series were filmed at the [[Kanab movie fort]] and Kanab Canyon in [[Utah]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nThe series followed Connors' series ''[[The Rifleman]]'', but it did not have that show's longevity, lasting only 48 episodes over two seasons. The first season was shot in black and white (with the exception of the three-part story \"The Mission,\" which was shot in color), and the second season of 32 episodes was made in color.\n\nAndrew J. Fenady served as the producer, later executive producer, on the series. Fenady was also the producer of [[The Rebel (TV series)|''The Rebel'']].\n\n==Episode list==\n\n===Season 1 (1965)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No. in<br />season \n! style=\"background:#;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Survival\n |DirectedBy=[[Richard Whorf]]\n |WrittenBy=[[Larry Cohen]]\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1965|1|24}}\n |ShortSummary=\n |LineColor=\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=2\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=The Vindicator\n |DirectedBy=[[Joseph H.

It was sponsored by [[Procter & Gamble]] in its Sunday night, 8:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time period. The series is set in the post Civil War old west. The show starred [[Chuck Connors]] as Jason McCord, a [[United States Army]] [[cavalry]] [[Captain (land)|captain]] who had been [[court-martialed]] and [[Drumming out|drummed out]] of the service following an unjust accusation of [[cowardice]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Chuck Connors Branded 1965.JPG|thumb|180px|left|McCord leaving the fort as the gates close behind him]]\nThe opening title credits of each episode in the series feature a depiction of McCord's [[cashiering]] and [[drumming out]] of the military.  He is then sent out of the fort where this ceremony occurred, and the gates are closed behind him. Although the exact date of McCord's cashiering is never given, events and people depicted in episodes place the events of the series itself as sometime during the first administration of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (1869-72) and after [[William Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska purchase]]. The name and location of the fort are also not given; but since [[Bitter Creek (Wyoming)|Bitter Creek]], where the battle that caused McCord's discharge took place, is in southern [[Wyoming]], the location of the fort is presumably within what was in 1869 the [[Wyoming Territory]]. U.S. military forts known to be in operation at that time in the territory included [[Fort Bridger]], [[Fort Fetterman]] and [[Fort Laramie]].\n\nIn the pilot episode, \"The Vindicator,\" McCord is confronted by a newspaper reporter ([[Claude Akins]]) who wants a follow-up story on the Bitter Creek massacre. McCord refuses to cooperate. He knows that General James Reed, McCord's mentor, was on a peace mission to meet representatives of the Cheyenne nation at Bitter Creek. His unit of 31 men was attacked by a group of renegade Indians known as [[Dog Soldiers]]. During the attack, McCord realized that the old general had taken leave of his senses. McCord assumed command, but it was too late. McCord was wounded in the battle and left for dead, the only survivor. He remained in a coma for 10 days after the attack. McCord was later charged with desertion, convicted at court-martial, and cashiered out of the Army.\n\nThe reporter tracks down a widow of the Bitter Creek massacre ([[June Lockhart]]). Her husband was third in command and had written several letters questioning Reed's mental state. Those letters would have been enough to grant McCord a new trial and possibly exonerate him, but McCord convinced the widow to burn the letters to protect Reed's reputation. McCord feared that if Reed's reputation were <!-- subjunctive --> damaged, certain people in Washington, DC, would try to start a new war with the Apaches. McCord chose never to speak about what really happened at Bitter Creek.\n\nMcCord retained the handle of his broken saber with attached [[pommel (sword)|pommel]]. He had the remaining blade sharpened into a long knife, which he used in many episodes. He traveled throughout the [[Old West]], continually confronted by people who refused to believe his innocence, requiring him to prove them wrong.\n\n[[John Pickard (American actor)|John M. Pickard]] appeared in six episodes as General [[Phil Sheridan]]. Other notable guest stars included [[Chris Alcaide]], [[Russ Conway (actor)|Russ Conway]], [[Don Collier]], [[Burgess Meredith]], [[John Carradine]], [[Pat Conway]], [[Alex Cord]], [[Janet De Gore]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], [[Chad Everett]], [[I. Stanford Jolley]], [[Martin Landau]], [[June Lockhart]], [[Gregg Palmer]], [[Larry Pennell]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Lee Van Cleef]], [[Bruce Dern]], and [[Michael Rennie]].\n\n==Production==\nCreated by [[Larry Cohen]], the show was co-produced for most of its run by [[Goodson-Todman Productions|Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions]] in association with Sentinel Productions, Inc. Goodson-Todman was primarily known for game and panel shows such as ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', and ''[[Match Game]]''; those are under [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]] now. Present-day U.S. rights to ''Branded'' came into the ownership of [[King World]] before it became [[CBS Television Distribution]]. Many stations that carry ''Branded'' today usually schedule the program alongside others about drifters in the Old West including [[Aaron Spelling]]'s ''[[The Guns of Will Sonnett]]'', which starred [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Dack Rambo]]; as with ''Branded'', King World / CBS also distributed ''Will Sonnett'' in syndication.\n\nParts of the series were filmed at the [[Kanab movie fort]] and Kanab Canyon in [[Utah]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nThe series followed Connors' series ''[[The Rifleman]]'', but it did not have that show's longevity, lasting only 48 episodes over two seasons. The first season was shot in black and white (with the exception of the three-part story \"The Mission,\" which was shot in color), and the second season of 32 episodes was made in color.\n\nAndrew J. Fenady served as the producer, later executive producer, on the series. Fenady was also the producer of [[The Rebel (TV series)|''The Rebel'']].\n\n==Episode list==\n\n===Season 1 (1965)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No. in<br />season \n! style=\"background:#;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Survival\n |DirectedBy=[[Richard Whorf]]\n |WrittenBy=[[Larry Cohen]]\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1965|1|24}}\n |ShortSummary=\n |LineColor=\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=2\n |EpisodeNumber2=2\n |Title=The Vindicator\n |DirectedBy=[[Joseph H.

He is sometimes called Kami (Kei) by his fans. Kageyama got his big break at age 16, as lead singer of the rock band [[Lazy (band)|Lazy]]. By the early '80s, the band split and Kageyama went solo. He found major success once he started to sing the theme songs of [[anime]] and [[tokusatsu]] shows. Becoming immensely popular soon after, Kageyama went on to be dubbed the \"Prince of Anime/Tokusatsu Songs\" and is a main fixture for shows to this day. He also got the nickname \"Mr. DBZ\" by fans of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' as he did the most songs for that anime. He is the original member and current leader of the [[Music in Japanese animation|anisong]] band [[JAM Project]]. Also, along with [[Masaaki Endoh]], he hosts ''Anipara Ongakukan'', a TV show aired on the Kids Station Channel that shows live performances of the theme songs of recent anime and tokusatsu shows.\n\nHe is also the voice of Zaruba, a talking ring and sidekick to the titular hero of the [[tokusatsu]] franchise ''[[Garo (TV series)|Garo]]'', for which JAM Project has performed the opening themes.\n\n== Original ==\n* Ky\u014d wo Ikiy\u014d (Solo Debut Song)\n* Suki Suki Suki\n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Original albums ===\n* [1981.12.01] [[Broken Heart (Hironobu Kageyama album)|BROKEN HEART]]\n* [1982.04.01] [[It's LIVE Runnin]]\n* [1982.12.15] [[FIRST AT LAST]]\n* [1983.08.25] [[Horizon (Hironobu Kageyama album)|HORIZON]]\n* [1985.06.21] [[Born Again (Hironobu Kageyama album)|BORN AGAIN]]\n* [2000.04.26] [[I'm in You (Hironobu Kageyama album)|I'm in you.]]\n* [2005.12.07] [[Cold Rain]]\n* [2007.07.25] [[30years3ounce]]\n* [2012.02.08] [[ROCK JAPAN]]\n* [2017.07.25] [[A.O.R]]\n\n=== Mini albums ===\n* [2008.07.23] [[Super Survivor]]\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n* [1989.02.25] THE BEST OF HIRONOBU KAGEYAMA\n* [1992.03.21] Stardust Boys\n* [1994.04.21] CYVOX\n* [1996.04.20] [[Hironobu Kageyama Best Album 3: Mixture]]\n* [1997.08.21] Hironobu Kageyama Eternity 20th Anniversary BOX\n* [2004.04.07] BEST & LIVE\n* [2004.12.22] GOLDEN\u2606BEST\n* [2018.08.06] Kage chan Pack ~Kimi to Boku no Daikoushin~\n\n=== Live albums ===\n* [1995.09.30] POWER LIVE'95 CYVOX \u301cCOMPLETE VERSION\u301c\n* [1998.11.18] POWER LIVE '98\n* [2002.02.06] Akogi na futaritabi daze!!

He is sometimes called Kami (Kei) by his fans. Kageyama got his big break at age 16, as lead singer of the rock band [[Lazy (band)|Lazy]]. By the early '80s, the band split and Kageyama went solo. He found major success once he started to sing the theme songs of [[anime]] and [[tokusatsu]] shows. Becoming immensely popular soon after, Kageyama went on to be dubbed the \"Prince of Anime/Tokusatsu Songs\" and is a main fixture for shows to this day. He also got the nickname \"Mr. DBZ\" by fans of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' as he did the most songs for that anime. He is the original member and current leader of the [[Music in Japanese animation|anisong]] band [[JAM Project]]. Also, along with [[Masaaki Endoh]], he hosts ''Anipara Ongakukan'', a TV show aired on the Kids Station Channel that shows live performances of the theme songs of recent anime and tokusatsu shows.\n\nHe is also the voice of Zaruba, a talking ring and sidekick to the titular hero of the [[tokusatsu]] franchise ''[[Garo (TV series)|Garo]]'', for which JAM Project has performed the opening themes.\n\n== Original ==\n* Ky\u014d wo Ikiy\u014d (Solo Debut Song)\n* Suki Suki Suki\n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Original albums ===\n* [1981.12.01] [[Broken Heart (Hironobu Kageyama album)|BROKEN HEART]]\n* [1982.04.01] [[It's LIVE Runnin]]\n* [1982.12.15] [[FIRST AT LAST]]\n* [1983.08.25] [[Horizon (Hironobu Kageyama album)|HORIZON]]\n* [1985.06.21] [[Born Again (Hironobu Kageyama album)|BORN AGAIN]]\n* [2000.04.26] [[I'm in You (Hironobu Kageyama album)|I'm in you.]]\n* [2005.12.07] [[Cold Rain]]\n* [2007.07.25] [[30years3ounce]]\n* [2012.02.08] [[ROCK JAPAN]]\n* [2017.07.25] [[A.O.R]]\n\n=== Mini albums ===\n* [2008.07.23] [[Super Survivor]]\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n* [1989.02.25] THE BEST OF HIRONOBU KAGEYAMA\n* [1992.03.21] Stardust Boys\n* [1994.04.21] CYVOX\n* [1996.04.20] [[Hironobu Kageyama Best Album 3: Mixture]]\n* [1997.08.21] Hironobu Kageyama Eternity 20th Anniversary BOX\n* [2004.04.07] BEST & LIVE\n* [2004.12.22] GOLDEN\u2606BEST\n* [2018.08.06] Kage chan Pack ~Kimi to Boku no Daikoushin~\n\n=== Live albums ===\n* [1995.09.30] POWER LIVE'95 CYVOX \u301cCOMPLETE VERSION\u301c\n* [1998.11.18] POWER LIVE '98\n* [2002.02.06] Akogi na futaritabi daze!!

In Manchester, he fell in with a group of aspiring actors and film makers, and his acting efforts began to become productive. He started to write and perform his own short films and plays. While performing a one-person show 'BUZZIN', based on his performance poetry, Jim was discovered by an acting agent.

Sturgess co-starred in the epic science fiction film ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]'', which began filming in September 2011 and was released in October 2012.\n\n==Personal life==\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\nSturgess was born in [[Wandsworth]], London, but grew up in [[Farnham]], [[Surrey]], where he attended [[Frensham Heights School]]. He spent most of his youth skateboarding in local car parks and started his first band when he was about 15 years old. The band played gigs in and around his local area. Sturgess's first acting experience came when a local theatre group came to his school looking for children to audition for a play. Sturgess went along to the audition and landed one of the parts in the play.\n\nSturgess moved to [[Manchester]] to attend the [[University of Salford]] in the hope that it would enable him to continue his music and take part in the Manchester music scene. In Manchester, he fell in with a group of aspiring actors and film makers, and his acting efforts began to become productive. He started to write and perform his own short films and plays. While performing a one-person show 'BUZZIN', based on his performance poetry, Jim was discovered by an acting agent. He graduated from the University of Salford in 1999 with an HND in Media and Performance.<ref name=\"wusvus\"/>\n\nIn July 2019, Sturgess married theatre producer [[Dina Mousawi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/jim-sturgess-brings-hoax-with-a-painful-legacy-to-life-in-new-jt-leroy-biopic-a4215026.html/ | title=Jim Sturgess brings hoax with a painful legacy to life in new JT LeRoy biopic |date=2015-03-12 |accessdate=2019-08-16}}</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nIn 2007, he was cast in [[Julie Taymor]]'s musical ''[[Across the Universe (film)|Across the Universe]]'', portraying Jude Feeny, a young man who travels to the US amid the raging throes of the late 1960s and falls in love with a sheltered American teenager, Lucy, played by [[Evan Rachel Wood]].\n\nIn 2008, he appeared in the historical drama ''[[The Other Boleyn Girl (2008 film)|The Other Boleyn Girl]]'' in the supporting role of [[George Boleyn]] opposite [[Natalie Portman]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], and [[Eric Bana]]. He also played the male lead role of Ben Campbell in ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]'', a film about five [[MIT Blackjack Team|MIT students]] who, by counting cards, take [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casinos for millions. Sturgess's co-stars in ''21'' include [[Kevin Spacey]] and [[Laurence Fishburne]].\n\nIn 2009, he played Gavin Kossef in ''[[Crossing Over (film)|Crossing Over]]'', appearing with [[Harrison Ford]], [[Ray Liotta]], and [[Ashley Judd]]. Set in Los Angeles, the story revolves around immigrants from different countries and backgrounds who share a common bond: they are all desperately trying to gain legal-immigrant status. Also in 2009, he starred in [[Kari Skogland]]'s critically acclaimed \u2018'[[Fifty Dead Men Walking]]'\u2019, loosely based on the true story related in a best-selling book by [[Martin McGartland]], of a young [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irishman]] who is recruited by the British police to infiltrate and spy on the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Irish Republican Army]], and who in the process ends up saving about 50 innocent lives.\n\n''[[Heartless (2009 film)|Heartless]]'', a film directed by [[Philip Ridley]], premiered on 31 August 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frightfest.co.uk/09films/film25.html |title=film25 |publisher=[[London FrightFest Film Festival]] |date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718101046/http://www.frightfest.co.uk/09films/film25.html |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}</ref> at the [[London FrightFest Film Festival]], a popular horror film festival. Sturgess appears as Jamie Morgan, a young man whose life has always been blighted by the large, heart-shaped port wine birthmark on his face and sells his soul to the devil. Jim Sturgess won the Best Actor Award at the 2010 [[Fantasporto]] Film Festival for his role. The film also won the Best Film Award and the Best Director Award for [[Philip Ridley]].\n\nIn 2010, Sturgess starred in the film ''[[The Way Back (2010 film)|The Way Back]]'', directed by [[Peter Weir]] and based on a true story. The character Sturgess plays is based on [[S\u0142awomir Rawicz]], a young Polish officer who escaped from a Russian [[gulag]] during World War II.
