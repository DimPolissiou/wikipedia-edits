Ratan decides to protect the good name of the family and does not tell anyone about the suicide note to anyone, including Hema. Shortly thereafter, Ratan is approached by a blackmailer named Shekhar, who threatens to expose Ratan's secret if Ratan does not participate in a bank robbery that will take place two days before the final audit.

{"title_page": "History of the Knights of Columbus", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2019}}\n{{main|Knights of Columbus}}\n\nThe '''history of the Knights of Columbus''' begins with its founding in 1882 by Father [[Michael J. McGivney]] at [[St. Mary's Church (New Haven, Connecticut)|St. Mary's Parish]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The organization was initially a mutual [[benefit society]] for a membership of practicing male Catholics. Today, it advocates for Catholic causes and provides a range of philanthropic and support services to Catholic institutions worldwide. It is also one of the world's largest insurance companies and operates the shrine to Pope John Paul II in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Order was designed to foster members' pride in both their Catholic and American heritages and to establish standards of behavior for Catholic gentlemen. It expanded beyond Connecticut and the United States to establish its first international councils by 1905. The organization provided relief to soldiers in wars throughout the 20th century and fought anti-Catholic and racial prejudice. Its substantial membership and financial resources have enabled it to exercise considerable influence within the Catholic church and to promote Catholic views in social and political discourse.\n\n==Early history==\n===Founding===\n[[File:Father McGivney 300.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of the Michael J. McGivney|[[Michael J. McGivney]], founder of the Knights of Columbus]]\n{{Main|Michael J. McGivney}}\n\n[[Michael J. McGivney]], an Irish\u2013American Catholic priest, founded the Knights of Columbus in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. He gathered a group of men from [[St. Mary's Church (New Haven, Connecticut)|St. Mary's Parish]] for an organizational meeting on October 2, 1881. It was incorporated on March 29, 1882. McGivney had originally conceived of the name \"Sons of Columbus\". [[James T. Mullen]], who later led the organization, coined the name \"Knights of Columbus\", which expressed the ritualistic nature of the new organization and drew from positive historical associations.<ref>[https://connecticuthistory.org/knights-of-columbus-chartered-today-in-history/ \"Knights of Columbus Chartered \u2013 Today in History: March 29\", Connecticut History.org]</ref>\n\nThe Order was intended to be a mutual benefit society. As a parish priest in an immigrant community, McGivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died. This was before most government support programs were established. He wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind.

Numerous state councils and the Supreme Council believed that this \"violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives\". They believed publication would stop if the KKK were assessed fines or punished by jail time assessed. They began suing distributors for [[libel]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=277}} The KKK ended its publication of the false oath. As the Order did not wish to appear motivated by a \"vengeful spirit\", it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=277}}\n\nTo help combat this misconception, the K of C submitted the actual oath of Fourth Degree members for examination by various groups of prominent non-Catholic men around the country. Many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the Knights.{{sfn|Egan|Kennedy|1920|p=122}} After examining the true oath, a committee of high-ranking California Freemasons, a group identified as a target in the bogus oath, declared in 1914: \n<blockquote>The ceremonial of the Order [of the Knights of Columbus] teaches a high and noble patriotism, instills a love of country, inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds up the Constitution of our Country as the richest and most precious possession of a Knight of the Order.{{sfn|Egan|Kennedy|1920|p=127}}</blockquote>\n\nIn [[Muncie, Indiana]], a local council organized a march of 750 people to protest the KKK.{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=34}}\n\n==''Pierce v. Society of Sisters''==\n\nAfter World War I, many native-born Americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about \"foreign\" values; they wanted public schools to teach children to be American. Numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture, and in 1922, the voters of Oregon passed the [[Oregon Compulsory Education Act]]. The law was primarily aimed at eliminating [[parochial school]]s, including Catholic schools.<ref name=\"pierce\"/><ref name=\"oregon\"/> It was promoted by groups such as the [[Knights of Pythias]], the Federation of Patriotic Societies, the Oregon Good Government League, the [[Orange Order]], and the Ku Klux Klan.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=282}}\n\nThe Compulsory Education Act required almost all children in Oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] by 1926.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=282}} [[Roger Nash Baldwin]], an associate director of the [[ACLU]] and a personal friend of then-Supreme Advocate and future Supreme Knight [[Luke E. Hart]], offered to join forces with the Order to challenge the law. The Knights of Columbus pledged an immediate $10,000 to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=283}}\n\nThe case became known as ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'', a seminal [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that significantly expanded coverage of the [[Due Process|Due Process Clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, not the state, had the authority to educate children as they thought best.<ref name=alley/> It upheld the religious freedom of parents to educate their children in religious schools.\n\n==Racial integration in the U.S.==\n\nTo combat the animus targeted at racial and religious minorities, including Catholics, the Order formed a historical commission which published a series of books on their contributions, among other activities.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=269\u2013270}}{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=31}} The \"Knights of Columbus Racial Contributions Series\" of books included three titles: ''The Gift of Black Folk'', by [[W.

Given the history of slavery and early development in the U.S., most African Americans were Protestant. But many in former French or Spanish territories had grown up Catholic. Church officials and organizations encouraged integration. By the end of the 1950s, Supreme Knight [[Luke E. Hart]] was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=396}} In 1963, Hart attended a special meeting at the White House hosted by President [[John F. Kennedy]] to discuss [[civil rights]] with other religious leaders. A few months later, a local KofC council rejected a black man's application because of his race, notwithstanding that he was a graduate of [[Notre Dame University]]. Six council officers resigned in protest, and the incident made national news. Hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next Supreme Convention, but died before he could see it take place.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=397}}\n\nThe 1964 Supreme Convention was scheduled to be held at the Roosevelt Hotel in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. A few days before the Convention, new Supreme Knight [[John W. McDevitt]] learned the hotel admitted only white guests, under the state's racial segregation policy. He threatened to move the Convention to another venue. The hotel changed its policy and so did the Order. The Convention amended the admissions rule to require that a new applicant could not be rejected by less than one-third of those voting. In 1972 the Supreme Convention amended its rules again, requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=400}}\n\n==Recent history==\n\nAccording to [[Massimo Faggioli]], the Knights of Columbus are \"'an extreme version' of a post-Vatican{{nbsp}}II phenomenon, the rise of discrete lay groups that have become centers of power themselves\".<ref name=financial/>\n\nIn 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] sent an aide to represent him at a Fourth Degree banquet in honor of the [[Golden Jubilee]] of the Order's entry into Cuba.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=391}} Supreme Knight [[Luke E.

McGivney]] at [[St. Mary's Church (New Haven, Connecticut)|St. Mary's Parish]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The organization was initially a mutual [[benefit society]] for a membership of practicing male Catholics. Today, it advocates for Catholic causes and provides a range of philanthropic and support services to Catholic institutions worldwide. It is also one of the world's largest insurance companies and operates the shrine to Pope John Paul II in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Order was designed to foster members' pride in both their Catholic and American heritages and to establish standards of behavior for Catholic gentlemen. It expanded beyond Connecticut and the United States to establish its first international councils by 1905. The organization provided relief to soldiers in wars throughout the 20th century and fought anti-Catholic and racial prejudice. Its substantial membership and financial resources have enabled it to exercise considerable influence within the Catholic church and to promote Catholic views in social and political discourse.\n\n==Early history==\n===Founding===\n[[File:Father McGivney 300.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of the Michael J.

He gathered a group of men from [[St. Mary's Church (New Haven, Connecticut)|St. Mary's Parish]] for an organizational meeting on October 2, 1881. It was incorporated on March 29, 1882. McGivney had originally conceived of the name \"Sons of Columbus\". [[James T. Mullen]], who later led the organization, coined the name \"Knights of Columbus\", which expressed the ritualistic nature of the new organization and drew from positive historical associations.<ref>[https://connecticuthistory.org/knights-of-columbus-chartered-today-in-history/ \"Knights of Columbus Chartered \u2013 Today in History: March 29\", Connecticut History.org]</ref>\n\nThe Order was intended to be a mutual benefit society. As a parish priest in an immigrant community, McGivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died. This was before most government support programs were established. He wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind. In his own life, he temporarily had to suspend his seminary studies to care for his family after his father died.{{sfn|Brinkley|Fenster|2006|p=51}}\n[[File:NewHavenStMarys.JPG|thumb|left|St. Mary's Church]]\n\nBecause of religious and ethnic discrimination, Roman Catholics in the late 19th century were regularly excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=8\u20139}} [[Papal encyclicals]] issued by the [[Holy See]] also prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within [[Freemasonry]]. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization. He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism were compatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud of their American\u2013Catholic heritage.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=17}}\n\nFraternal organizations, which combined social aspects and ritual, were especially flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century, the so-called \"[[Golden age of fraternalism|Golden Age of Fraternalism]].<ref name=glenn/> New Haven's Irish Catholic men of the era could have joined one of many other organizations,{{efn|For example, the [[Knights of St. Patrick]], the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]], the [[Friendly Sons of St. Patrick]], the Sons of Erin, the [[Catholic Order of Foresters]], the [[Red Knights (fraternal society)|Red Knights]], the [[Irish Catholic Benevolent Union]], the [[Hibernian Society]], the [[Catholic Benevolent League]], the [[Ancient Order of Foresters]], the [[St. Vincent's Death Benefit League]], any number of local parish total abstinence societies.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}}}} and Catholics of other ethnicities had additional options.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}}\n\nMcGivney traveled to Boston to examine the Massachusetts [[Catholic Order of Foresters]] and to Brooklyn, New York to learn about the recently established Catholic Benevolent League, both of which offered insurance benefits. He found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day. He explored establishing a New Haven Court of the Foresters, but the group's charter in Massachusetts limited them to operating within that Commonwealth. McGivney's committee of St. Mary's parishioners decided to form a new club.{{sfn|Brinkley|Fenster|2006|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\n\n===Catholic and American===\n\n[[File:Ridolfo Ghirlandaio Columbus.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of Christopher Columbus.|[[Christopher Columbus]] is the patron and namesake of the Knights.]]\n\nTaking the name of Columbus was partially intended as a mild rebuke to [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] leaders, who upheld the explorer (a [[Genoa|Genovese]] Italian Catholic who had worked for Catholic Spain) as an American hero, yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent Catholic immigrants.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|}}<ref name=\"FonerFredrickson2004\"/> In taking Columbus as their patron, the founders expressed their belief that not only could Catholics be full members of American society, they were instrumental in its foundation.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=174}}{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|}}<ref name=\"FonerFredrickson2004\"/>\n\nOf the first 28 members of the first council, 16 were born in Ireland.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}} A majority of the first generation of Knights across the Order were immigrants.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}} Joining the Knights gave the recent immigrants a mantle of \"middle-class American respectability without forfeiting their preexisting ethnic and religious identities\", and gave them \"a rhetorical foundation for claims to full American citizenship\".{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}}\n\nUnlike many other Catholic organizations of the time, though, the Knights placed a greater emphasis on loyalty to their new world republics than they did on old ethnic divisions of the old world.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=173}}{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=9}} McGivney envisioned an organization that would imbue members \"with a zealous pride in one's American\u2013Catholic heritage\".{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=173}}{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=17}} In Canada, a similar sentiment held among early members.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}}\n\nThe model of Christian knighthood promoted by the Order \"provided Catholic men with a positive interpretation of the separation they would have experienced relative to the Protestant-dominated social and political context in New Haven.\"{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}} The Order effused a sense that as Catholic gentlemen and Knights of Columbus they should be regarded as exemplars of virtue, not aberrations from the dominant Protestant model of manhood.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}}\n\n===High standards for members===\n\nMembership was limited to \"practical\" Catholic men or \"Catholics in good standing\" at the time of their application.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}} Only \"worthy\" men were permitted to join.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}} As Catholics in parishes that were predominately Irish and Irish-American, the demands placed on them by the church would be well known to them.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}}\n\nPerhaps to counteract the perception of the Irish as drunks or lower class, sobriety was demanded of members.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}} The Order was the only fraternal organization in America at the time whose constitution did not exclude African American members,{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=32\u201333}} but \"liquor dealers\" were expressly prohibited from joining.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}} Newspapers at the time published \"sensationalized accounts of inebriated soirees\" held by other organizations for Irishmen, but the \"Knights' social functions\u2014formal dinners, balls, and cotillions\u2014also reflected members' aspirations toward middle-class refinement.\"{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}}\n\nAt the Board of Government convention in 1887, a proposal was made to admit non-Catholics, but was strongly opopsed by Supreme Knight [[John J.

Our laws design us to be Catholics pure and simple.\"{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}}\n\n===Growth===\n\nAlthough its first councils were all in Connecticut, the Order spread throughout [[New England]] and the United States in subsequent years. The Order experienced \"unparalleled success\" in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}} It outpaced all other Catholic fraternities of the era.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}} By 1904, only five states had no council.<ref name=tampa/>\n\nBy the time of the first annual convention in 1884, the Order was prospering.

To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a ten-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico\", the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=Pelowski />\n\nIn 1926, a delegation of Supreme Council officers met with President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to share with him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico. The order subsequently launched a $1{{nbsp}}million campaign to educate Americans about the attacks on Catholics and the church in the [[Cristero War]].<ref name=\"legacy\"/> The organization produced pamphlets in English and Spanish denouncing the anticlerical Mexican government and its policies.

In addition, they purportedly were prepared to [[Flaying|flay]], burn alive, boil, kill, and otherwise [[torture]] anyone, including women and children, when called upon to do so by church authorities.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=171}}{{sfn|Egan|Kennedy|1920|p=120}} \"It is a strange paradox,\" according to some commentators, that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of anti-Americanism.{{sfn|Egan|Kennedy|1920|p=121}}\n\nThe \"bogus oath\" was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] more than three centuries earlier.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=169}} The [[Ku Klux Klan]], which was growing into a newly powerful force through the 1920s, spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their contemporary campaign against Catholics (which was part of a campaign against immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, of whom many were Catholic).{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=276}}<ref name=fry/><ref name=Mecklin/> During the [[1928 Presidential election]], the Klan printed and distributed a million copies of the oath in an effort to defeat Catholic Democratic candidate [[Al Smith]]. [[Thomas S. Butler]] (R), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania, read it into the [[Congressional Record]].<ref name=\"fake\"/> The bogus oath was refuted by the [[Committee of Public Information]], a propaganda agency of the U.S. Government established during World War{{nbsp}}I.{{sfn|Egan|Kennedy|1920|p=121}}\n\nMisunderstanding Catholicism, the Klan alleged that Knights were only loyal to the Pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the United States government.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=277}} Across the country, local, state, and the Supreme Councils offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath was authentic.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=278}} No one could, but that did not stop the Klan from continuing to publish and distribute copies. Numerous state councils and the Supreme Council believed that this \"violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives\". They believed publication would stop if the KKK were assessed fines or punished by jail time assessed. They began suing distributors for [[libel]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=277}} The KKK ended its publication of the false oath. As the Order did not wish to appear motivated by a \"vengeful spirit\", it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=277}}\n\nTo help combat this misconception, the K of C submitted the actual oath of Fourth Degree members for examination by various groups of prominent non-Catholic men around the country. Many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the Knights.{{sfn|Egan|Kennedy|1920|p=122}} After examining the true oath, a committee of high-ranking California Freemasons, a group identified as a target in the bogus oath, declared in 1914: \n<blockquote>The ceremonial of the Order [of the Knights of Columbus] teaches a high and noble patriotism, instills a love of country, inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds up the Constitution of our Country as the richest and most precious possession of a Knight of the Order.{{sfn|Egan|Kennedy|1920|p=127}}</blockquote>\n\nIn [[Muncie, Indiana]], a local council organized a march of 750 people to protest the KKK.{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=34}}\n\n==''Pierce v. Society of Sisters''==\n\nAfter World War I, many native-born Americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about \"foreign\" values; they wanted public schools to teach children to be American. Numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture, and in 1922, the voters of Oregon passed the [[Oregon Compulsory Education Act]]. The law was primarily aimed at eliminating [[parochial school]]s, including Catholic schools.<ref name=\"pierce\"/><ref name=\"oregon\"/> It was promoted by groups such as the [[Knights of Pythias]], the Federation of Patriotic Societies, the Oregon Good Government League, the [[Orange Order]], and the Ku Klux Klan.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=282}}\n\nThe Compulsory Education Act required almost all children in Oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] by 1926.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=282}} [[Roger Nash Baldwin]], an associate director of the [[ACLU]] and a personal friend of then-Supreme Advocate and future Supreme Knight [[Luke E. Hart]], offered to join forces with the Order to challenge the law. The Knights of Columbus pledged an immediate $10,000 to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=283}}\n\nThe case became known as ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'', a seminal [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that significantly expanded coverage of the [[Due Process|Due Process Clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, not the state, had the authority to educate children as they thought best.<ref name=alley/> It upheld the religious freedom of parents to educate their children in religious schools.\n\n==Racial integration in the U.S.==\n\nTo combat the animus targeted at racial and religious minorities, including Catholics, the Order formed a historical commission which published a series of books on their contributions, among other activities.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=269\u2013270}}{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=31}} The \"Knights of Columbus Racial Contributions Series\" of books included three titles: ''The Gift of Black Folk'', by [[W.

Given the history of slavery and early development in the U.S., most African Americans were Protestant. But many in former French or Spanish territories had grown up Catholic. Church officials and organizations encouraged integration. By the end of the 1950s, Supreme Knight [[Luke E. Hart]] was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=396}} In 1963, Hart attended a special meeting at the White House hosted by President [[John F. Kennedy]] to discuss [[civil rights]] with other religious leaders. A few months later, a local KofC council rejected a black man's application because of his race, notwithstanding that he was a graduate of [[Notre Dame University]]. Six council officers resigned in protest, and the incident made national news. Hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next Supreme Convention, but died before he could see it take place.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=397}}\n\nThe 1964 Supreme Convention was scheduled to be held at the Roosevelt Hotel in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. A few days before the Convention, new Supreme Knight [[John W. McDevitt]] learned the hotel admitted only white guests, under the state's racial segregation policy. He threatened to move the Convention to another venue. The hotel changed its policy and so did the Order. The Convention amended the admissions rule to require that a new applicant could not be rejected by less than one-third of those voting. In 1972 the Supreme Convention amended its rules again, requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=400}}\n\n==Recent history==\n\nAccording to [[Massimo Faggioli]], the Knights of Columbus are \"'an extreme version' of a post-Vatican{{nbsp}}II phenomenon, the rise of discrete lay groups that have become centers of power themselves\".<ref name=financial/>\n\nIn 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] sent an aide to represent him at a Fourth Degree banquet in honor of the [[Golden Jubilee]] of the Order's entry into Cuba.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=391}} Supreme Knight [[Luke E.

His interest in drawing came from long periods of illness; as a child he suffered from [[pleurisy]].\n\nHe studied art in his native New York as a teenager, sketching the city, and joined the [[Art Students League of New York]] in 1900. For his livelihood, he worked in a bronze [[foundry]] by day, studying drawing and sculptural modelling at night. Epstein's first major commission was to illustrate [[Hutchins Hapgood]]'s 1902 book ''Spirit of the Ghetto''. Epstein used the money from the commission to move to Paris.\n\n==Move to Europe==\n\nMoving to Europe in 1902, he studied in Paris at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] and the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts|\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]].

He served briefly in the 38th Battalion of the [[Royal Fusiliers]], known as the [[Jewish Legion]] during World War I; following a breakdown, he was discharged in 1918 without having left England.\n\n===Work===\nIn London, Epstein involved himself with a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and artistic crowd. Revolting against ornate, pretty art, he made bold, often harsh and massive forms of bronze or stone. His sculpture is distinguished by its vigorous rough-hewn [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. [[Avant-garde]] in concept and style, his works often shocked his audience. This was not only a result of their (often explicit) sexual content, but also because they deliberately abandoned the conventions of classical Greek sculpture favoured by [[Academic art|European Academic sculptors]] to experiment instead with the aesthetics of art traditions as diverse as those of India, West Africa, and the Pacific Islands.<ref>Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

Oxford University Press, 2011, pp.103\u2013164.</ref> People in [[Liverpool]], however, nicknamed his nude male sculpture over the door of [[Lewis's]] department store \"Dickie Lewis\". Such factors may have focused disproportionate attention on certain aspects of Epstein's long and productive career, throughout which he aroused hostility, especially challenging taboos surrounding the depiction of sexuality.\n\n[[File:Jacob Epstein (1934).jpg|upright|left|thumb|Jacob Epstein in 1934, photograph by [[Carl Van Vechten]]]]\n[[File:Jan Smuts statue.JPG|upright|thumb|right|''[[Jan Smuts]]'' in [[Parliament Square]], London]]\nLondon was not ready for Epstein's first major commission \u2013 18 large nude sculptures made in 1908 for the fa\u00e7ade of [[Charles Holden]]'s building for the [[British Medical Association]] on [[Strand, London|The Strand]] (now [[Zimbabwe House]]) were initially considered shocking to [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] sensibilities, again mainly due to the perception that they were sexually over-explicit. In art-historical terms, however, the Strand sculptures were controversial for quite a different reason: they represented Epstein's first thoroughgoing attempt to break away from traditional European iconography in favour of elements derived from an alternative sculptural milieu \u2013 that of [[Sculpture in India|classical India]]. The female figures in particular may be seen deliberately to incorporate the posture and hand gestures of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art from the subcontinent in no uncertain terms.<ref>[http://www.burlington.org.uk/magazine/back-issues/2010/201004/.html \"Jacob Epstein \u2013 the Indian connection\"], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', November 2008.</ref><ref>[http://vimeo.com/arrowsmith/cosmopolitanism-and-modernism Video of a Lecture detailing Epstein's Debts to Indian Temple Sculpture], ''[[London University School of Advanced Study]]'', March 2012. For another perception on these sculptures and on Indian influence on Epstein, see: Gilboa, \"Unto Heaven will I ascend\", pp.124-5.</ref>  The current, mutilated condition of many of the sculptures is also not entirely connected with prudish censorship; the damage was caused in the 1930s when possibly dangerous projecting features were hacked off after pieces fell from one of the statues.\n\nOne of the most famous of Epstein's early commissions is ''[[Oscar Wilde's tomb]]'' in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]], Paris, \"which was condemned as indecent and at one point was covered in tarpaulin by the French police.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n[[File:Rock Drill by Jacob Epstein.jpg|thumb|right|Epstein's 1913 sculpture ''[[Rock Drill (Jacob Epstein)|The Rock Drill]]'' in its original form. It is now lost.]]\n\nBetween 1913 and 1915, Epstein was associated with the short-lived [[Vorticism]] movement and produced one of his best known sculptures ''[[Rock Drill (Jacob Epstein)|The Rock Drill]]''.\n\nIn 1915, [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], wealthy American collector and patron to the modernists, bought some Epstein sculptures to add to his private collection.<ref>Stock, Noel (1970). ''The Life of Ezra Pound''. Pantheon Books. p. 202</ref>\n\nIn 1916, Epstein was commissioned by [[Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar|Viscount Tredegar]] to produce a bronze head of Newport poet [[W. H. Davies]]. The bronze, regarded by many as the most accurate artistic impression of Davies and a copy of which Davies owned himself, may be found at [[Newport Museum|Newport Museum and Art Gallery]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/27348|title='William Henry Davies' by Jacob Epstein, January 1917|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1928, Epstein sculpted the head of the popular singer and film star [[Paul Robeson]]. A commission from Holden for the new headquarters building of the [[London Electric Railway]] generated another controversy in 1929. His nude sculptures ''Day'' and ''Night'' above the entrances of [[55 Broadway]] were again considered indecent and a debate raged for some time regarding demands to remove the offending statues which had been carved ''in-situ''. Eventually a compromise was reached to modify the smaller of the two figures represented on ''Day''. But the controversy affected his commissions for public work which dried up until World War II.\n\nBetween the late 1930s and the mid-1950s, numerous works by Epstein were exhibited in [[Blackpool]]. ''Adam'', ''Consummatum Est'', ''Jacob and the Angel and Genesis'', and other works, were initially displayed in an old drapery shop surrounded by red velvet curtains. The crowds were ushered in at the cost of a shilling by a barker on the street. After a small tour of American fun fairs, the works were returned to Blackpool and were exhibited in the anatomical curiosities section of [[Louis Tussaud]]'s waxworks. The works were displayed alongside dancing [[marionette]]s, diseased body parts and [[Conjoined twins|conjoined (\"Siamese\") twin]] babies in jars. Placing Epstein within the context of freakish curiosity perhaps added to Epstein's decision not to create further large-scale [[direct carving]]s.\n\n[[File:Statue of St Michael and the devil - Coventry Cathedral 14d06.jpg|left|thumb|''[[St Michael's Victory over the Devil]]'' (1958), on the new [[Coventry Cathedral]]]]\n\nBronze portrait sculpture formed one of Epstein's staple products, and perhaps the best known. These sculptures were often executed with roughly textured surfaces, expressively manipulating small surface planes and facial details. Some fine examples are in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]. Another example is the bust of the Arsenal manager [[Herbert Chapman]] that sat in the marble halls of [[Highbury]] for many years before being moved to the new [[Emirates Stadium]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Epstein was asked to undertake six commissions for the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]].  After completing bronze busts of Admiral of the Fleet Sir [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], General Sir [[Alan Cunningham]], and Air Marshal Sir [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Charles Portal]] - and [[Ernest Bevin]], Epstein accepted a commission to create busts of [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. He completed a [[bust of Winston Churchill (Epstein)|bust of Winston Churchill]] in early 1947.\n\nEpstein's aluminium figure of Christ in Majesty (1954\u201355), is suspended above the nave in [[Llandaff Cathedral]], [[Cardiff]], on a concrete arch designed by [[George Pace]].\n\nHis larger sculptures were his most expressive and experimental, but also his most vulnerable. His depiction of Rima, one of author [[W. H. Hudson]]'s most famous characters, graces a serene enclosure in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Even here, a visitor became so outraged as to defile it with paint. He was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the [[3rd Sculpture International]], which was organised by the Fairmount Park Association (now the [[Association for Public Art]]) and held at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in the summer of 1949.\n\nEpstein would often sculpt the images of friends, casual acquaintances, and even people dragged from the street into his studio almost at random.

For his livelihood, he worked in a bronze [[foundry]] by day, studying drawing and sculptural modelling at night.

Revolting against ornate, pretty art, he made bold, often harsh and massive forms of bronze or stone. His sculpture is distinguished by its vigorous rough-hewn [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. [[Avant-garde]] in concept and style, his works often shocked his audience. This was not only a result of their (often explicit) sexual content, but also because they deliberately abandoned the conventions of classical Greek sculpture favoured by [[Academic art|European Academic sculptors]] to experiment instead with the aesthetics of art traditions as diverse as those of India, West Africa, and the Pacific Islands.<ref>Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

In art-historical terms, however, the Strand sculptures were controversial for quite a different reason: they represented Epstein's first thoroughgoing attempt to break away from traditional European iconography in favour of elements derived from an alternative sculptural milieu \u2013 that of [[Sculpture in India|classical India]]. The female figures in particular may be seen deliberately to incorporate the posture and hand gestures of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art from the subcontinent in no uncertain terms.<ref>[http://www.burlington.org.uk/magazine/back-issues/2010/201004/.html \"Jacob Epstein \u2013 the Indian connection\"], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', November 2008.</ref><ref>[http://vimeo.com/arrowsmith/cosmopolitanism-and-modernism Video of a Lecture detailing Epstein's Debts to Indian Temple Sculpture], ''[[London University School of Advanced Study]]'', March 2012. For another perception on these sculptures and on Indian influence on Epstein, see: Gilboa, \"Unto Heaven will I ascend\", pp.124-5.</ref>  The current, mutilated condition of many of the sculptures is also not entirely connected with prudish censorship; the damage was caused in the 1930s when possibly dangerous projecting features were hacked off after pieces fell from one of the statues.\n\nOne of the most famous of Epstein's early commissions is ''[[Oscar Wilde's tomb]]'' in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]], Paris, \"which was condemned as indecent and at one point was covered in tarpaulin by the French police.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n[[File:Rock Drill by Jacob Epstein.jpg|thumb|right|Epstein's 1913 sculpture ''[[Rock Drill (Jacob Epstein)|The Rock Drill]]'' in its original form. It is now lost.]]\n\nBetween 1913 and 1915, Epstein was associated with the short-lived [[Vorticism]] movement and produced one of his best known sculptures ''[[Rock Drill (Jacob Epstein)|The Rock Drill]]''.\n\nIn 1915, [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], wealthy American collector and patron to the modernists, bought some Epstein sculptures to add to his private collection.<ref>Stock, Noel (1970). ''The Life of Ezra Pound''. Pantheon Books. p. 202</ref>\n\nIn 1916, Epstein was commissioned by [[Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar|Viscount Tredegar]] to produce a bronze head of Newport poet [[W. H. Davies]]. The bronze, regarded by many as the most accurate artistic impression of Davies and a copy of which Davies owned himself, may be found at [[Newport Museum|Newport Museum and Art Gallery]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/27348|title='William Henry Davies' by Jacob Epstein, January 1917|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1928, Epstein sculpted the head of the popular singer and film star [[Paul Robeson]]. A commission from Holden for the new headquarters building of the [[London Electric Railway]] generated another controversy in 1929. His nude sculptures ''Day'' and ''Night'' above the entrances of [[55 Broadway]] were again considered indecent and a debate raged for some time regarding demands to remove the offending statues which had been carved ''in-situ''. Eventually a compromise was reached to modify the smaller of the two figures represented on ''Day''. But the controversy affected his commissions for public work which dried up until World War II.\n\nBetween the late 1930s and the mid-1950s, numerous works by Epstein were exhibited in [[Blackpool]]. ''Adam'', ''Consummatum Est'', ''Jacob and the Angel and Genesis'', and other works, were initially displayed in an old drapery shop surrounded by red velvet curtains. The crowds were ushered in at the cost of a shilling by a barker on the street. After a small tour of American fun fairs, the works were returned to Blackpool and were exhibited in the anatomical curiosities section of [[Louis Tussaud]]'s waxworks. The works were displayed alongside dancing [[marionette]]s, diseased body parts and [[Conjoined twins|conjoined (\"Siamese\") twin]] babies in jars. Placing Epstein within the context of freakish curiosity perhaps added to Epstein's decision not to create further large-scale [[direct carving]]s.\n\n[[File:Statue of St Michael and the devil - Coventry Cathedral 14d06.jpg|left|thumb|''[[St Michael's Victory over the Devil]]'' (1958), on the new [[Coventry Cathedral]]]]\n\nBronze portrait sculpture formed one of Epstein's staple products, and perhaps the best known. These sculptures were often executed with roughly textured surfaces, expressively manipulating small surface planes and facial details. Some fine examples are in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]. Another example is the bust of the Arsenal manager [[Herbert Chapman]] that sat in the marble halls of [[Highbury]] for many years before being moved to the new [[Emirates Stadium]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Epstein was asked to undertake six commissions for the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]].  After completing bronze busts of Admiral of the Fleet Sir [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], General Sir [[Alan Cunningham]], and Air Marshal Sir [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Charles Portal]] - and [[Ernest Bevin]], Epstein accepted a commission to create busts of [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. He completed a [[bust of Winston Churchill (Epstein)|bust of Winston Churchill]] in early 1947.\n\nEpstein's aluminium figure of Christ in Majesty (1954\u201355), is suspended above the nave in [[Llandaff Cathedral]], [[Cardiff]], on a concrete arch designed by [[George Pace]].\n\nHis larger sculptures were his most expressive and experimental, but also his most vulnerable. His depiction of Rima, one of author [[W. H. Hudson]]'s most famous characters, graces a serene enclosure in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Even here, a visitor became so outraged as to defile it with paint. He was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the [[3rd Sculpture International]], which was organised by the Fairmount Park Association (now the [[Association for Public Art]]) and held at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in the summer of 1949.\n\nEpstein would often sculpt the images of friends, casual acquaintances, and even people dragged from the street into his studio almost at random. He worked even on his dying day. He also painted; many of his watercolours and gouaches were of [[Epping Forest]], where he lived (at [[Loughton]]) and sculpted. These were often exhibited at the [[Leicester Galleries]] in London. His ''Monkwood Autumn'' and ''Pool, Epping Forest'' date from 1944\u201345.\n\nEpstein was Jewish,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748615,00.html \"ART: Familiar Sensation\"], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', 25 March 1935. \"The spectacle to which he referred was an 11-ft., 7-ton statue of Christ propped against the wall in London's swank [[Leicester Galleries]], the latest work of a heavyset, U.S.-born Jewish sculptor, Jacob Epstein.\"</ref><ref>Ezra Mendelsohn, ''Painting a People: Maurycy Gottlieb and Jewish Art'', [[University Press of New England]], 2002, p. 240. \"In his discussion of the American-born Jewish sculptor Jacob Epstein, Hutchins Hapgood writes\"</ref><ref>Alyson Pendlebury, ''Portraying 'the Jew' in First World War Britain'', Vallentine Mitchell, 2006, p. 165. \"Among the most striking of these is an image of the Anglo-Jewish sculptor Jacob Epstein, a private in the 38th battalion, modelling a human figure out of sand\"</ref><ref>Peter Lawson, Anthony Rudolf, ''Anglo-Jewish Poetry from Isaac Rosenberg to Elaine Feinstein'', Vallentine Mitchell, 2006, p. 84. \"with the American-Jewish sculptor Jacob Epstein\"</ref> and negative reviews of his work sometimes took on an [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] flavour, though he did not attribute the \"average unfavorable criticism\" of his work to antisemitism.<ref>Epstein, Jacob.

He remembered his meeting with Einstein as, \"His glance contained a mixture of the humane, the humorous and the profound. This was a combination which delighted me.
