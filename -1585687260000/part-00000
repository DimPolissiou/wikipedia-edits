He came from a wealthy planter family, and shortly before the war he was one of the largest slaveholders in the Southeast as well as a state legislator. During the American Civil War, he served in the Confederate [[cavalry]], where he reached the rank of [[lieutenant general]].\n\nAt the end of [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction]], with the withdrawal of federal troops from the state, Hampton was leader of the [[Redeemers]] who restored white rule. His campaign for governor was marked by extensive violence by the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a [[paramilitary]] group that served the Democratic Party by disrupting elections and suppressing black and Republican voting in the state.  He was elected Governor, serving 1876 to 1879. After that, he served two terms as [[U.S. Senator]], from 1879 to 1891.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Col. William Rhett House Charleston.jpg|thumb|left|The Col. [[William Rhett]] House, 54 Hasell St., Charleston, South Carolina, the birthplace of Wade Hampton III]]\nWade Hampton III was born in 1818 at [[Col. William Rhett House|54 Hasell St.]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the eldest son of \"Colonel\" [[Wade Hampton II]] (1791&ndash;1858) and Ann (n\u00e9e Fitzsimmons) Hampton. His mother was from a wealthy family in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].<ref name=Tagg359>Tagg, p. 359.</ref> After the War of 1812, his father had built his own fortune on land speculation in the Southeast.{{citation needed|date = July 2019}}\n\nThe senior Hampton was an officer of [[dragoon]]s in the [[War of 1812]], and an aide to General [[Andrew Jackson]] at the [[Battle of New Orleans]]. The boy was the grandson of [[Wade Hampton I|Wade Hampton]] (1754&ndash;1835), [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] of cavalry in the [[American War of Independence]], member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], and [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[War of 1812]]. Wade III's uncle by marriage, [[James Henry Hammond]], was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], [[Governor of South Carolina]] and, in the late 1850s, elected to the [[South Carolina Senate]].{{citation needed|date = July 2019}}\n\nWade Hampton III grew up in a wealthy planter family, receiving private instruction. He had four younger sisters. His was an active outdoor life; he rode horses and hunted, especially at his family's [[North Carolina]] summer retreat, [[High Hampton Inn Historic District|High Hampton]].<ref>[http://www.highhamptoninn.com/history.aspx High Hampton history].</ref> The youth was known for taking hunting trips alone into the woods, hunting [[American black bear]]s with only a knife. Some accounts credit him with killing as many as 80 bears.<ref>Ackerman, p. 16, cites [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s ''The Wilderness Hunter'' for the figure of 80. Although Ackerman suggests 80 may be exaggerated, Hampton was considered \"an excellent and fearless hunter\".</ref>\n\nIn 1836 Hampton graduated from South Carolina College (now the [[University of South Carolina]]), and was trained for the law, although he never practiced. His father assigned certain [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] to him to manage in South Carolina and [[Mississippi]].<ref name=Tagg359/> The younger man also became active in Democratic state politics.{{citation needed|date = July 2019}}\n\nHe was elected to the [[South Carolina General Assembly]] in 1852 and served as a state Senator from 1858 to 1861. After Hampton's father died in 1858, the son inherited his vast fortune, his plantations, and his slaves.{{citation needed|date = July 2019}}\n\n==Civil War==\nAlthough Hampton was conservative on issues of secession and slavery, and he had opposed the division of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a legislator, when war began, he was loyal to his state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knowsouthernhistory.net/Biographies/Wade_Hampton/|title=Wade Hampton|website=www.knowsouthernhistory.net|access-date=2017-10-23}}</ref> He resigned from the South Carolina Senate and enlisted at the age of 42 as a private in the South Carolina Militia.

As was also the case in northern regiments, the elite were commissioned based on their social standing and were also expected to finance military units. Hampton organized and partially financed the unit known as \"[[Hampton's Legion]],\" which consisted of six companies of infantry, four companies of cavalry, and one battery of artillery. He personally paid for all the weapons for the Legion.\n\nHampton was a natural cavalryman&mdash;brave, audacious, and already a superb horseman. Of officers without previous military experience, he was one of three to achieve the rank of [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]], the others being [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] and [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]].\n\nHampton's first combat came at the [[First Battle of Manassas]], where he deployed his Legion at a decisive moment, reinforcing a Confederate line that was retreating from Buck Hill, giving the brigade of [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] time to reach the field and make a defensive stand. A bullet creased Hampton's forehead when he led a charge against a Union artillery position. It was the first of five wounds he would receive during the war.\n\nDuring the winter of 1861-62, Hampton's Legion was assigned to the command of [[Gustavus W. Smith]]. Smith's division accompanied the rest of [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] down the Virginia Peninsula to aid in the [[Siege of Yorktown (1862)]] before Johnston withdrew to Richmond. On May 23, 1862, Hampton was promoted to [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]]. At the [[Battle of Seven Pines]] on May 31, 1862, he was severely wounded in the foot, but while still under fire, remained on his horse while the foot was treated. Hampton returned to duty in time to fill in as leader of an infantry brigade for Stonewall Jackson at the end of the [[Seven Days Battles]], although the brigade was not significantly engaged.\n\nAfter the Peninsula Campaign, General [[Robert E. Lee]] reorganized his cavalry forces as a division under the command of [[J.E.B. Stuart]], who selected Hampton as his senior subordinate, to command one of two cavalry brigades. Hampton's brigade was left in Richmond to keep eyes on McClellan's withdrawal from the Peninsula, while the rest of the army participated in the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]]. Thus, Hampton and his men missed the [[Second Battle of Manassas]], re-joining the army shortly thereafter; but were present on the extreme left of the Confederate line at [[Battle of Antietam|Sharpsburg]]. His brigade was selected to participate in Stuart's [[Chambersburg Raid]] in October 1862, in which Hampton was briefly appointed \"military governor\" of the town following its surrender to the Confederate cavalry.<ref>Foote, Shelby. The Civil War: A Narrative. Vol. 1, Fort Sumter to Perryville. New York: Random House, 1958. {{ISBN|0-394-49517-9}}.</ref> During the winter of 1862, Hampton led a series of cavalry raids behind enemy lines and captured numerous prisoners and supplies without suffering any casualties, earning a commendation from General Lee. In November 1862, he captured 137 men of the [[3rd Pennsylvania Cavalry]] at [[Hartwood Presbyterian Church]].<ref name=VAnom>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Stafford/089-0082_Hartwood_Presbyterian_Church_1989_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Hartwood Presbyterian Church|author=John N. Pearce |date=February 1989|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources}}</ref>\n\nHampton was not present at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], or [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] due to being detached for raids elsewhere.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Brandy Station]], the war's largest predominantly cavalry battle, Hampton was slightly wounded and his younger brother Frank, was killed. Immediately thereafter, Hampton's brigade participated in Stuart's raid in Pennsylvania, swinging around the Union army and losing contact with Lee. Stuart and Hampton reached the vicinity of [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], late on July 2, 1863. While just outside town, Hampton was confronted by a Union cavalryman pointing a rifle at him from 200 yards. Hampton charged the trooper before he could fire his rifle, but another trooper blindsided Hampton with a saber cut to the back of his head. On July 3, Hampton led the cavalry attack to the east of Gettysburg, attempting to disrupt the Union rear areas, but colliding with Union cavalry. He received two more saber cuts to the front of his head, but continued fighting until he was wounded again with a piece of shrapnel to the hip. He was carried back to Virginia in the same ambulance as General [[John Bell Hood]]. On August 3, 1863, Hampton was promoted to [[Major General (CSA)|major general]] and received command of a cavalry division. As his wounds from Gettysburg were slow to heal, he could not return to duty until November.\n\nDuring the [[Overland Campaign]] of 1864, Hampton's cavalry fought at [[Battle of Todd's Tavern|Todd's Tavern]] during [[Battle of the Wilderness|The Wilderness]], and patrolled the left flank of the Confederate position at [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]], during which time J.E.B. Stuart was killed at the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern|Yellow Tavern]]. Hampton escorted Lee's withdrawal to Richmond, fighting at [[Battle of North Anna|North Anna]] and [[Battle of Haw's Shop|Haw's Shop]] before being detached from Lee's army to deal with Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]]'s cavalry destroying railroad in central Virginia. He distinguished himself further with a successful strategic victory at the bloody [[Battle of Trevilian Station]], the war's largest all cavalry battle. After his return to Richmond, he fought at [[Battle of Nance's Shop|Nance's Shop]], and was given command of the Cavalry Corps on August 11, 1864. For the rest of the war, Hampton lost no cavalry battles. In September, Hampton conducted what became known as the \"[[Beefsteak Raid]]\", where his troopers captured over 2400 head of cattle and more than 300 prisoners behind enemy lines.\n\nIn October 1864, near [[Petersburg, Virginia]], Hampton sent his son, T. Preston Hampton, a lieutenant serving as one of his aides, to deliver a message. Shortly afterward, Hampton and his other son, Wade IV, rode in the same direction. Before traveling 200 yards, they came across Preston lying on the ground; he was fatally wounded and soon died. As young Wade dismounted, he was also shot but survived.<ref>''New York Times,'' June 27, 1897.</ref>\n\nWhile Lee's army was bottled up in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], in January 1865, Hampton returned to South Carolina to recruit soldiers. He was promoted to lieutenant general on February 14, 1865, but eventually surrendered to the Union along with General [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s Army of Tennessee at [[Bennett Place]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. Hampton was reluctant to surrender, and nearly got into a personal fight with Union Brig. Gen. [[Judson Kilpatrick]] (often called \"Kill-Cavalry\") at the Bennett Farm.\n\n==Postwar years==\nTogether with Lt. Gen. [[Jubal A. Early]], Hampton became a proponent of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] movement. He worked to explain the Confederacy's loss of the war and deeply regretted the loss of the secure life he had before the war. He strongly resented the use of [[African-American|black]] troops as part of the Federal government's occupying force in South Carolina.\n\n[[File:Wade Hampton III - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|Senator Wade Hampton]]\nHampton was offered the nomination for [[Governor of South Carolina|governor]] in 1865, but refused because he believed Northerners would be suspicious of a former Confederate general seeking political office only months after the end of the Civil War. Hampton campaigned to ask supporters ''not'' to vote for him in the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1865|gubernatorial election]]. In 1868, he became the chairman of the [[South Carolina Democratic Party|state Democratic Party]] central committee. That year, the [[Radical Republicans]] took the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1868|election]].\n\nHe essentially ceased most overt political activity until 1876. He helped raise money for legal defense funds after the Federal government started to enforce anti-Klan legislation of 1870 and 1871 to suppress the violence of its members against [[freedmen]] and white Republicans. He was not known to have active involvement within the organization.<ref>Andrew, Rod Jr., ''Wade Hampton: Confederate Warrior to Southern Redeemer'', University of North Carolina Press, 2008, pages 343-4</ref> Hampton supported [[Matthew Calbraith Butler]] in the [[Union Reform Party of South Carolina|Union Reform]] [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1870|campaign of 1870]].\n\nOther insurgent groups rapidly formed to replace the KKK. In South Carolina and other states, groups of men calling themselves \"rifle clubs\" formed to act as [[vigilante]]s in the years after the war. In 1876, an estimated 20,000 men in South Carolina were members of rifle clubs in the state.<ref name=\"cisco\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=uqKmExW5vE8C&pg=PA272&dq=Wade+Hampton+accusations&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UkV8UpWAJcbmyQG_n4CAAw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=REd%20Shirts&f=false Walter Brian Cisco, ''Wade Hampton: Confederate Warrior, Conservative Statesman''], Potomac Books, 2004, p. 260</ref> Political campaigns were increasingly violent as whites tried to suppress black voting.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1870s, the Democratic [[paramilitary]] group known as the [[Red Shirts (South Carolina)|Red Shirts]] developed chapters in most South Carolina counties (they had originated in Mississippi), and were similar to rifle clubs. These groups acted as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> They marched in parades during campaigns, openly disrupted Republican meetings, and worked to suppress black voting in the state by violence and intimidation.<ref name=\"lane\">Charles Lane, ''The Day Freedom Died,'' (2008) p. 247</ref> By 1876, there were estimated to be 20,000 men who were members of rifle clubs in the state.<ref name=\"cisco\"/>\n\nHampton opposed the Radical Republicans' [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] policies in the South. He re-entered South Carolina politics in 1876, running in opposition to those policies. Hampton, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], ran against Republican incumbent governor [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain]].\n\nHampton used [[Grace Peixotto]]'s \"Big Brick House,\" a prominent [[brothel]] located at 11 Fulton Street in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], to assure complete privacy for the Red Shirts' meetings; it mainly served as campaign headquarters.<ref>Jones 2006: 22-23</ref> The [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876|1876 South Carolina gubernatorial election]] is thought to be the bloodiest in the history of the state. The Red Shirts had used violence in every county to suppress black Republican voting. \"An anti-Reconstruction historian later estimated that 150 Negroes were murdered in South Carolina during the campaign.\"<ref>[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar Straus & Giroux, Paperback, 2007, p.174</ref>\n\nBoth parties claimed victory. For more than six months, there were two legislatures in the state, both claiming to be authentic. Eventually, the [[South Carolina Supreme Court]] ruled that Hampton was the winner of the election, the first Democratic governor in South Carolina since the end of the Civil War. The national election of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] as [[President of the United States|President]] was settled by a compromise among Democrats, by which the national party agreed to end formally the [[Reconstruction era]]. In 1877 Hayes ordered the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, essentially leaving freedmen to deal with whites on their own.\n\nAfter the election, Hampton became known as the \"Savior of South Carolina\"; he was one of those Democrats elected who were called \"[[Redeemers]].\" He was re-elected in [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1878|1878]]; the Red Shirts gave support but less violence was required.<ref name=\"lane\"/> Two days later, he was thrown from a mule while deer hunting and broke his right leg. Several weeks later, his right leg was amputated due to complications arising from this injury.\n\nDespite refusing to announce his candidacy for the Senate, Hampton was elected to the [[United States Senate]] by the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] on the same day his leg was amputated. He resigned from the governorship to serve two terms in the Senate, until 1891. He was a [[Bourbon Democrat]] who appealed to some [[freedmen]] in support of his win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thisweekinthecivilwar.com/?p=923/Lieutenant|title=Lieutenant General Wade Hampton III, C.S.A.

The town of Hampton Courthouse, later shortened to [[Hampton, South Carolina|Hampton]], was incorporated on December 23, 1879, to serve as the [[county seat]] of Hampton County.\n\nAcross South Carolina, many towns and cities renamed streets for him.

He came from a wealthy planter family, and shortly before the war he was one of the largest slaveholders in the Southeast as well as a state legislator. During the American Civil War, he served in the Confederate [[cavalry]], where he reached the rank of [[lieutenant general]].\n\nAt the end of [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction]], with the withdrawal of federal troops from the state, Hampton was leader of the [[Redeemers]] who restored white rule. His campaign for governor was marked by extensive violence by the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a [[paramilitary]] group that served the Democratic Party by disrupting elections and suppressing black and Republican voting in the state.  He was elected Governor, serving 1876 to 1879. After that, he served two terms as [[U.S. Senator]], from 1879 to 1891.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Col.

He had four younger sisters. His was an active outdoor life; he rode horses and hunted, especially at his family's [[North Carolina]] summer retreat, [[High Hampton Inn Historic District|High Hampton]].<ref>[http://www.highhamptoninn.com/history.aspx High Hampton history].</ref> The youth was known for taking hunting trips alone into the woods, hunting [[American black bear]]s with only a knife. Some accounts credit him with killing as many as 80 bears.<ref>Ackerman, p. 16, cites [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s ''The Wilderness Hunter'' for the figure of 80. Although Ackerman suggests 80 may be exaggerated, Hampton was considered \"an excellent and fearless hunter\".</ref>\n\nIn 1836 Hampton graduated from South Carolina College (now the [[University of South Carolina]]), and was trained for the law, although he never practiced. His father assigned certain [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] to him to manage in South Carolina and [[Mississippi]].<ref name=Tagg359/> The younger man also became active in Democratic state politics.{{citation needed|date = July 2019}}\n\nHe was elected to the [[South Carolina General Assembly]] in 1852 and served as a state Senator from 1858 to 1861.

As was also the case in northern regiments, the elite were commissioned based on their social standing and were also expected to finance military units. Hampton organized and partially financed the unit known as \"[[Hampton's Legion]],\" which consisted of six companies of infantry, four companies of cavalry, and one battery of artillery. He personally paid for all the weapons for the Legion.\n\nHampton was a natural cavalryman&mdash;brave, audacious, and already a superb horseman. Of officers without previous military experience, he was one of three to achieve the rank of [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]], the others being [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] and [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]].\n\nHampton's first combat came at the [[First Battle of Manassas]], where he deployed his Legion at a decisive moment, reinforcing a Confederate line that was retreating from Buck Hill, giving the brigade of [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] time to reach the field and make a defensive stand. A bullet creased Hampton's forehead when he led a charge against a Union artillery position. It was the first of five wounds he would receive during the war.\n\nDuring the winter of 1861-62, Hampton's Legion was assigned to the command of [[Gustavus W. Smith]]. Smith's division accompanied the rest of [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] down the Virginia Peninsula to aid in the [[Siege of Yorktown (1862)]] before Johnston withdrew to Richmond. On May 23, 1862, Hampton was promoted to [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]]. At the [[Battle of Seven Pines]] on May 31, 1862, he was severely wounded in the foot, but while still under fire, remained on his horse while the foot was treated. Hampton returned to duty in time to fill in as leader of an infantry brigade for Stonewall Jackson at the end of the [[Seven Days Battles]], although the brigade was not significantly engaged.\n\nAfter the Peninsula Campaign, General [[Robert E. Lee]] reorganized his cavalry forces as a division under the command of [[J.E.B. Stuart]], who selected Hampton as his senior subordinate, to command one of two cavalry brigades. Hampton's brigade was left in Richmond to keep eyes on McClellan's withdrawal from the Peninsula, while the rest of the army participated in the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]]. Thus, Hampton and his men missed the [[Second Battle of Manassas]], re-joining the army shortly thereafter; but were present on the extreme left of the Confederate line at [[Battle of Antietam|Sharpsburg]]. His brigade was selected to participate in Stuart's [[Chambersburg Raid]] in October 1862, in which Hampton was briefly appointed \"military governor\" of the town following its surrender to the Confederate cavalry.<ref>Foote, Shelby. The Civil War: A Narrative. Vol. 1, Fort Sumter to Perryville. New York: Random House, 1958. {{ISBN|0-394-49517-9}}.</ref> During the winter of 1862, Hampton led a series of cavalry raids behind enemy lines and captured numerous prisoners and supplies without suffering any casualties, earning a commendation from General Lee. In November 1862, he captured 137 men of the [[3rd Pennsylvania Cavalry]] at [[Hartwood Presbyterian Church]].<ref name=VAnom>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Stafford/089-0082_Hartwood_Presbyterian_Church_1989_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Hartwood Presbyterian Church|author=John N. Pearce |date=February 1989|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources}}</ref>\n\nHampton was not present at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], or [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] due to being detached for raids elsewhere.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Brandy Station]], the war's largest predominantly cavalry battle, Hampton was slightly wounded and his younger brother Frank, was killed. Immediately thereafter, Hampton's brigade participated in Stuart's raid in Pennsylvania, swinging around the Union army and losing contact with Lee. Stuart and Hampton reached the vicinity of [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], late on July 2, 1863. While just outside town, Hampton was confronted by a Union cavalryman pointing a rifle at him from 200 yards. Hampton charged the trooper before he could fire his rifle, but another trooper blindsided Hampton with a saber cut to the back of his head. On July 3, Hampton led the cavalry attack to the east of Gettysburg, attempting to disrupt the Union rear areas, but colliding with Union cavalry. He received two more saber cuts to the front of his head, but continued fighting until he was wounded again with a piece of shrapnel to the hip. He was carried back to Virginia in the same ambulance as General [[John Bell Hood]]. On August 3, 1863, Hampton was promoted to [[Major General (CSA)|major general]] and received command of a cavalry division. As his wounds from Gettysburg were slow to heal, he could not return to duty until November.\n\nDuring the [[Overland Campaign]] of 1864, Hampton's cavalry fought at [[Battle of Todd's Tavern|Todd's Tavern]] during [[Battle of the Wilderness|The Wilderness]], and patrolled the left flank of the Confederate position at [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]], during which time J.E.B. Stuart was killed at the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern|Yellow Tavern]]. Hampton escorted Lee's withdrawal to Richmond, fighting at [[Battle of North Anna|North Anna]] and [[Battle of Haw's Shop|Haw's Shop]] before being detached from Lee's army to deal with Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]]'s cavalry destroying railroad in central Virginia. He distinguished himself further with a successful strategic victory at the bloody [[Battle of Trevilian Station]], the war's largest all cavalry battle. After his return to Richmond, he fought at [[Battle of Nance's Shop|Nance's Shop]], and was given command of the Cavalry Corps on August 11, 1864. For the rest of the war, Hampton lost no cavalry battles. In September, Hampton conducted what became known as the \"[[Beefsteak Raid]]\", where his troopers captured over 2400 head of cattle and more than 300 prisoners behind enemy lines.\n\nIn October 1864, near [[Petersburg, Virginia]], Hampton sent his son, T. Preston Hampton, a lieutenant serving as one of his aides, to deliver a message. Shortly afterward, Hampton and his other son, Wade IV, rode in the same direction. Before traveling 200 yards, they came across Preston lying on the ground; he was fatally wounded and soon died. As young Wade dismounted, he was also shot but survived.<ref>''New York Times,'' June 27, 1897.</ref>\n\nWhile Lee's army was bottled up in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], in January 1865, Hampton returned to South Carolina to recruit soldiers. He was promoted to lieutenant general on February 14, 1865, but eventually surrendered to the Union along with General [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s Army of Tennessee at [[Bennett Place]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. Hampton was reluctant to surrender, and nearly got into a personal fight with Union Brig. Gen. [[Judson Kilpatrick]] (often called \"Kill-Cavalry\") at the Bennett Farm.\n\n==Postwar years==\nTogether with Lt. Gen. [[Jubal A. Early]], Hampton became a proponent of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] movement. He worked to explain the Confederacy's loss of the war and deeply regretted the loss of the secure life he had before the war. He strongly resented the use of [[African-American|black]] troops as part of the Federal government's occupying force in South Carolina.\n\n[[File:Wade Hampton III - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|Senator Wade Hampton]]\nHampton was offered the nomination for [[Governor of South Carolina|governor]] in 1865, but refused because he believed Northerners would be suspicious of a former Confederate general seeking political office only months after the end of the Civil War. Hampton campaigned to ask supporters ''not'' to vote for him in the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1865|gubernatorial election]]. In 1868, he became the chairman of the [[South Carolina Democratic Party|state Democratic Party]] central committee. That year, the [[Radical Republicans]] took the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1868|election]].\n\nHe essentially ceased most overt political activity until 1876. He helped raise money for legal defense funds after the Federal government started to enforce anti-Klan legislation of 1870 and 1871 to suppress the violence of its members against [[freedmen]] and white Republicans. He was not known to have active involvement within the organization.<ref>Andrew, Rod Jr., ''Wade Hampton: Confederate Warrior to Southern Redeemer'', University of North Carolina Press, 2008, pages 343-4</ref> Hampton supported [[Matthew Calbraith Butler]] in the [[Union Reform Party of South Carolina|Union Reform]] [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1870|campaign of 1870]].\n\nOther insurgent groups rapidly formed to replace the KKK. In South Carolina and other states, groups of men calling themselves \"rifle clubs\" formed to act as [[vigilante]]s in the years after the war. In 1876, an estimated 20,000 men in South Carolina were members of rifle clubs in the state.<ref name=\"cisco\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=uqKmExW5vE8C&pg=PA272&dq=Wade+Hampton+accusations&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UkV8UpWAJcbmyQG_n4CAAw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=REd%20Shirts&f=false Walter Brian Cisco, ''Wade Hampton: Confederate Warrior, Conservative Statesman''], Potomac Books, 2004, p. 260</ref> Political campaigns were increasingly violent as whites tried to suppress black voting.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1870s, the Democratic [[paramilitary]] group known as the [[Red Shirts (South Carolina)|Red Shirts]] developed chapters in most South Carolina counties (they had originated in Mississippi), and were similar to rifle clubs. These groups acted as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> They marched in parades during campaigns, openly disrupted Republican meetings, and worked to suppress black voting in the state by violence and intimidation.<ref name=\"lane\">Charles Lane, ''The Day Freedom Died,'' (2008) p. 247</ref> By 1876, there were estimated to be 20,000 men who were members of rifle clubs in the state.<ref name=\"cisco\"/>\n\nHampton opposed the Radical Republicans' [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] policies in the South. He re-entered South Carolina politics in 1876, running in opposition to those policies. Hampton, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], ran against Republican incumbent governor [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain]].\n\nHampton used [[Grace Peixotto]]'s \"Big Brick House,\" a prominent [[brothel]] located at 11 Fulton Street in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], to assure complete privacy for the Red Shirts' meetings; it mainly served as campaign headquarters.<ref>Jones 2006: 22-23</ref> The [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876|1876 South Carolina gubernatorial election]] is thought to be the bloodiest in the history of the state. The Red Shirts had used violence in every county to suppress black Republican voting. \"An anti-Reconstruction historian later estimated that 150 Negroes were murdered in South Carolina during the campaign.\"<ref>[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar Straus & Giroux, Paperback, 2007, p.174</ref>\n\nBoth parties claimed victory. For more than six months, there were two legislatures in the state, both claiming to be authentic. Eventually, the [[South Carolina Supreme Court]] ruled that Hampton was the winner of the election, the first Democratic governor in South Carolina since the end of the Civil War. The national election of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] as [[President of the United States|President]] was settled by a compromise among Democrats, by which the national party agreed to end formally the [[Reconstruction era]]. In 1877 Hayes ordered the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, essentially leaving freedmen to deal with whites on their own.\n\nAfter the election, Hampton became known as the \"Savior of South Carolina\"; he was one of those Democrats elected who were called \"[[Redeemers]].\" He was re-elected in [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1878|1878]]; the Red Shirts gave support but less violence was required.<ref name=\"lane\"/> Two days later, he was thrown from a mule while deer hunting and broke his right leg. Several weeks later, his right leg was amputated due to complications arising from this injury.\n\nDespite refusing to announce his candidacy for the Senate, Hampton was elected to the [[United States Senate]] by the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] on the same day his leg was amputated. He resigned from the governorship to serve two terms in the Senate, until 1891. He was a [[Bourbon Democrat]] who appealed to some [[freedmen]] in support of his win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thisweekinthecivilwar.com/?p=923/Lieutenant|title=Lieutenant General Wade Hampton III, C.S.A.

In 1899, his home in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], was destroyed by fire. An elderly man, he then had limited funds and few means to find a new home. Over his strong protests, a group of friends raised enough funds to build him one.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nHe was a hereditary member of the South Carolina [[Society of the Cincinnati]].\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1838, Hampton married Margaret Preston (1818-1852).

Their children were: George McDuffie Hampton (1859-1917), Mary Singleton \"Daisy\" Hampton (1861-1934), Alfred Hampton (1863-1942), and Catherine Fisher Hampton (born and died 1867)\n\nIn 1890, Hampton's niece [[Caroline Hampton|Caroline]], an operating room nurse, married [[William Halsted]], later known as the \"father of American [[surgery]]\" for his contributions.

The town of Hampton Courthouse, later shortened to [[Hampton, South Carolina|Hampton]], was incorporated on December 23, 1879, to serve as the [[county seat]] of Hampton County.\n\nAcross South Carolina, many towns and cities renamed streets for him. At least eight municipalities in South Carolina have a street named \"Wade Hampton\" ([[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Duncan, South Carolina|Duncan]], [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]], [[Greer, South Carolina|Greer]], Hampton, [[Taylors, South Carolina|Taylors]], and [[Walterboro, South Carolina|Walterboro]]) and approximately 47 towns in the state have streets named \"Hampton\". Two high schools in South Carolina are named Wade Hampton High School: in Greenville and in [[Varnville, South Carolina|Varnville]]. A residence hall at Hampton's alma mater, the [[University of South Carolina]], was named for him.\n\nA [[Hampton Park (Charleston)|Hampton Park]] was dedicated in Charleston and another in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] in his honor. The historic [[Hampton Heights]] neighborhood in [[Spartanburg]] is named after him. In 1964, Wade Hampton Academy was started in [[Orangeburg, South Carolina|Orangeburg]], considered a [[segregation academy]]. The school merged with Willington Academy in 1986 to become [[Orangeburg Preparatory Schools, Inc.]]\n\nIn 1913, Judge [[John Randolph Tucker (judge)|John Randolph Tucker]] named the [[Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska|Wade Hampton Census Area]] in [[Alaska]] to commemorate his father-in-law (it was renamed Kusilvak Census Area in 2015 to remove the blemish of having a place named for a slave-holding Confederate general).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.adn.com/article/20150702/wade-hampton-no-more-alaska-census-area-named-confederate-officer-gets-new-moniker|title=Wade Hampton no more: Alaska census area named for confederate officer gets new moniker|date=July 2, 2015|accessdate=July 2, 2015|first=Lisa|last=Demer|work=Alaska Dispatch News}}</ref>\n\nAn artillery battery was named after Wade Hampton at [[Fort Crockett]], built on [[Galveston Island]], Texas. The Wade Hampton Battery was one of four coastal artillery batteries and contained two 10-inch guns. During World War II, the SS ''Wade Hampton'', a [[Liberty ship]] named in honor of the general, was sunk off the coast of [[Greenland]] by a German [[U-boat]].\n\nIn [[Greenville County, South Carolina]], the section of [[U.S. Route 29]] that connects the city of Greenville to Spartanburg is called Wade Hampton Boulevard. There is also a fire district ([[Wade Hampton, South Carolina|Wade Hampton Fire Department]]) named in his honor placed on the east side of Greenville, adjoining the Greenville city limits, which include Wade Hampton High School.\n\nThe [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] awarded Hampton with its [[Confederate Medal of Honor]], created in 1977.<ref name=\"Tucker2013\">{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C.|title=American Civil War: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection &#91;6 volumes&#93;: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dvYAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2202|date=30 September 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-682-4|page=2202}}</ref>\n\n==In fiction==\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', [[Scarlett O'Hara]]'s first husband, Charles Hamilton, serves in Hampton's regiment.

In the film version of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With The Wind]],'' the letter sent to Scarlett advising her of Charles' death is shown to be signed by Hampton.\n\nIn the ''[[North and South (trilogy)|North and South]]'' [[trilogy]] by [[John Jakes]], the character Charles Main serves with Hampton's cavalry throughout the Civil War.\n\nHampton appears in a small role in ''[[How Few Remain]]'', the first novel in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Southern Victory Series]],'' an [[alternate history]] in which the South wins the [[American Civil War]].

They are usually contracted by either an insect vector or by contact with an infected substance or surface and include organisms that are now classified in the supergroups [[Excavata]], [[Amoebozoa]], [[SAR supergroup|SAR]], and [[Archaeplastida]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Prescott's Microbiology|last=Wiley, Sandman, Wood|first=K, J, D|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\n\nProtozoan infections are responsible for diseases that affect many different types of organisms, including plants, animals, and some marine life. Many of the most prevalent and deadly human diseases are caused by a protozoan infection, including [[African trypanosomiasis|African Sleeping Sickness]], [[Amoebiasis|amoebic dysentery]], and [[malaria]].\n\nThe species originally termed \"protozoa\" are not closely related to each other and only have superficial similarities ([[eukaryotic]], [[unicellular]], [[motile]], though with exceptions). The terms \"protozoa\" (and [[protist]]) are usually discouraged in the modern [[biosciences]]. However, this terminology is still encountered in [[medicine]]. This is partially because of the conservative character of [[medical classification]] and partially due to the necessity of making identifications of organisms based upon morphology.\n\nWithin the taxonomic classification, the four protist supergroups (Amoebozoa, Excavata, SAR, and Archaeplastida) fall under the Domain Eukarya. Protists are an artificial grouping of over 64,000 different single-celled life forms. This means that it is difficult to define protists due to their extreme differences and uniqueness. Protists are a ''polyphyletic'' [(of a group of organisms) derived from more than one common evolutionary ancestor or ancestral group and therefore not suitable for placing in the same taxon]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polyphyletic|title=Definition of POLYPHYLETIC|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> a collection of organisms and they are unicellular, which means that they lack the level of tissue organization which is present in more complex eukaryotes. Protists grow in a wide variety of moist habitats and a majority of them are free-living organisms. In these moist environments, plankton and terrestrial forms can also be found. Protists are ''chemoorganotrophic'' [<nowiki/>[[organism]]s which oxidize the chemical bonds in [[organic compound]]s as their energy source]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chemoorganotrophic|title=Definition of CHEMOORGANOTROPHIC|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> and are responsible for recycling nitrogen and phosphorus. Parasites also are responsible for causing disease in humans and domesticated animals.\n\nProtozoa are ''chemoorganotrophic'' protists and have three different ways of acquiring nutrients. The first method of acquiring nutrients is through saprotrophic nutrition. In saprotrophic nutrition, nutrients are obtained from dead organic matter through enzymatic degradation. The second method of acquiring nutrients is through osmotrophic nutrition. In osmotrophic nutrition, nutrients are obtained through absorbing soluble products. The third method of acquiring nutrients is through holozoic nutrition. In holozoic nutrition, solid nutrients are absorbed through phagocytosis<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nSome protozoa are ''photoautotrophic'' protists. These protists include strict aerobes, and use photosystems I and II in order to carry out photosynthesis which produces oxygen<ref name=\":0\" />. \n[[File:Plasmodium-BIO FINAL (1).svg|thumb|Diagram of ''Plasmodium'' structure]]\n''Mixotrophic'' protists obtain nutrients through organic and inorganic carbon compounds simultaneously<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nAll cells have a plasma membrane. In a protist, the plasma membrane is also known as the plasmalemma. Just below the plasma membrane, and in the inner fluid region, cytoplasm can be found. The pellicle structure in the protist is a thin layer of protein that helps provide the cell with some support and protection.\u00a0 In addition to the plasma membrane, protists contain two different types of vacuoles. Contractile vacuoles help to maintain osmoregulation, and phagocytic vacuoles allow select protists to ingest food. In some protists, flagella and/or cilia may be present to help with motility and nutrient intake. The flagella/cilia create water currents that assist in feeding and respiration. Energy intake is necessary for protists\u2019 survival. Aerobic chemoorganotrophic protists produce energy through the use of their mitochondria. The mitochondria then generates energy for the protist to keep up with cellular life functions. Photosynthetic protists produce energy through the use of their mitochondria and chloroplasts. Finally, anaerobic chemoorganotrophs produce energy through the use of hydrogenosomes, which is a membrane enclosed organelle that releases molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nEncystment is when a protist becomes a dormant cyst with a cell wall; during encystment, the cyst has decreased complexity and metabolic activity relative to the protist. Encystment protects the protist from environmental changes, the cyst can be a site for nuclear reorganization and cell division, and it can act as a host cell in order to transfer parasitic species. Excystment is when a return to favorable conditions may cause a cyst to return to its original state. In parasitic protists, excystment may occur when the cyst is ingested by a new host<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nProtists reproduce asexually or sexually. If the protists reproduce asexually, they do so through binary fission, multiple fission, budding, and fragmentation. If the protists reproduce sexually, they do so through a syngamy process where there is a fusion of the gametes. If this occurs in an individual it is recognized as autogamy. If this occurs between individuals, it is known as conjugation<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n== Supergroup ''Excavata''==\n<br />''[[Excavata]]'' are considered primitive eukaryotes. They are characterized by a feeding groove with a posteriorly located flagella, which allows them to create a current that captures small food particles<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology2/chapter/excavata/|title=Excavata {{!}} Biology for Majors II|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. The cytostome is the specialized structure that allows the protists this function. This supergroup ''Excavata'' includes the subgroups ''Diplomonads (Fornicata)'', ''Parabasalids'', and ''Euglenozoans''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book:_General_Biology_(Boundless)/23:_Protists/23.3:_Groups_of_Protists/23.3A:_Excavata|title=23.3A: Excavata|last=|first=|date=|website=Lumen Learning|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11/12/2019}}</ref>. \n\n=== Diplomonads ===\n[[Diplomonad|Dipolomonads]] used to be defined as ''Fornicata'', but their characteristics remain the same despite their renaming. They are microaerophilic protists. ''Diplomonads'' were previously defined by the lack of a mitochondria, but recent studies have found that they have a nonfunctional, mitochondrial remnant organelle called a mitosome. Most are harmless except for ''Giardia'', ''Hexamita salmonis'', and ''Histomonas meleagridis''. ''Giardia'' causes diarrhea, ''Hexamita'' ''salmonis'' is a fish parasite, and ''Histomonas meleagridis'' is a turkey pathogen.\n\n''[[Giardia intestinalis]]'' is a human pathogen, which is transmitted by cyst contaminated water. It causes epidemic diarrhea from contaminated water. You can tell you may be infected by the observation of cysts or trophozoites in stools and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test. To prevent contamination, avoid any possibly contaminated water, and if contaminated water is the only thing available to drink, a slow sand filter should be used. A study found that the chlorination of water and nutritional intervention had no effect on childhood giardia infection. Only handwashing and hygienic sanitation interventions reduced infection rates in children<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Audrie|last2=Ercumen|first2=Ayse|last3=Benjamin-Chung|first3=Jade|last4=Arnold|first4=Benjamin F.|last5=Das|first5=Shimul|last6=Haque|first6=Rashidul|last7=Ashraf|first7=Sania|last8=Parvez|first8=Sarker M.|last9=Unicomb|first9=Leanne|last10=Rahman|first10=Mahbubur|last11=Hubbard|first11=Alan E.|date=2018-10-30|title=Effects of Water, Sanitation, Handwashing, and Nutritional Interventions on Child Enteric Protozoan Infections in Rural Bangladesh: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial|url=https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/67/10/1515/4969830|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=67|issue=10|pages=1515\u20131522|doi=10.1093/cid/ciy320|pmid=29669039|pmc=6206106|issn=1058-4838}}</ref>. \n\n''Hexamita'' ''salmonis'' is a common flagellated fish pathogen.

They lack a distinct cytostome, which means they must use phagocytosis to engulf food. There are two subgroups: ''Trichonympha'' and ''Trichomonadida''. ''Trichonympha'' are obligate mutualists of wood-eating insects such as termites. They secrete cellulose, which is used for digesting wood. The next subgroup, ''Trichomonadida'', does not require oxygen and possesses hydrogenosomes. They only reproduce through asexual reproduction and some strains are human pathogens. There are three types of pathogenic parabasalia: ''Trichomonas foetus, Dientamoeba fragilis'', and ''Trichomonas vaginalis''. ''Trichomonas foetus'' causes spontaneous abortion in cattle, ''Dientamoeba fragilis'' causes diarrhea in humans, and ''Trichomonas vaginalis'' is a sexually transmitted disease<ref name=\":0\" />.\n[[File:Tritrichomonas foetus (259 26) Cultured.jpg|thumb|Image of a cultured ''Tritrichomonas foetus'']]\n''Trichomonas foetus'' is a parasite that resides in the urogenital tract of cattle and causes bovine trichomoniasis.

No one knows how ''D. fragilis'' is spread, possibly due to swallowing contaminated water or food. Many people who are infected with this parasite, show no signs of being infected. Sometimes the infection can be observed, the most common symptoms include diarrhea, stomach pains, loss of appetite, nausea, and fatigue<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dientamoeba-fragilis-infection|title=Dientamoeba Fragilis Infection|website=WebMD|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. \n\n''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]'' is a sexually transmitted disease. Men who are infected rarely show any symptoms (asymptomatic). Women who are infected usually show signs of soreness, inflammation, and redness around the vagina and a possible change in vaginal discharge. ''Trichomonas vaginalis'' can be treated with a course of antibiotics<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/trichomoniasis.html|title=Trichomoniasis|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. \n\n=== Euglenozoa ===\nMost Euglenozoa are [[Phototroph|photoautotrophic]], but some are [[Chemoorganotroph|chemoorganotrophs]] (saprophytic). They are commonly found in freshwater. The members of the phylum Euglenozoa have a [[Pellicle (biology)|pellicle]] for support, a red eye spot called a stigma to orient the cell toward light, chlorophyll a and b to assist in the process of photosynthesis, contractile vacuoles, and flagella.\n[[File:Leishmania braziliensis Peru.jpg|thumb|''Leishmaniasis'' lesion on adult human forearm|260x260px]]\nOne major pathogen from the phylum Euglenozoa is ''Leishmania.'' ''Leishmania'' causes leishmaniasis. The symptoms of leishmaniasis include systemic and skin/membrane damage. Leishmania parasites spread by phlebotomine sand flies in the tropics, subtropics, and southern Europe<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/index.html|title=CDC - Leishmaniasis|last=Prevention|first=CDC-Centers for Disease Control and|date=2019-02-27|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>.  They may manifest cutaneously (cutaneous leishmaniasis) as skin sores with as scab a few weeks after the bite or internally (visceral leishmaniasis), affecting the organs, which can be life-threatening.

''Trypanosoma cruzi'' causes Chagas disease and is transmitted by the reduviid bug, also known as the \u201ckissing bug.\u201d\u00a0 Chagas disease is diagnosed using a physical exam and blood test<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/chagasdisease.html|title=Chagas Disease|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. The only treatment includes antiparasitics only from the CDC, which are not FDA approved<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20356218|title=Chagas disease - Diagnosis and treatment - Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. Acute Chagas disease has a quick onset, the trypanosomes enter the bloodstream, they become amastigotes, and replicate. Acute Chagas disease can be treated using benznidazole or nifurtimox. Chronic chagas disease is asymptomatic and causes heart and gastrointestinal cells to be affected. Currently, there are only investigational treatments for this disease. Unfortunately, vaccines are not effective with Chagas disease due to antigenic variation. This pathogen causes damage to the nervous system.\n\n[[African trypanosomiasis|African Sleeping Sickness]] is caused by ''Trypanosoma brucei rhodensiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense'', and is transmitted by the tsetse fly. It is diagnosed by a physical exam and blood test.  African sleeping sickness causes interstitial inflammation, lethargy, brain swelling, and death within one to three years. Drug therapy, using Eflornithine and Melarsoprol Pentamidine for ''T. gambiense'' and Suramin(Antrypol) for either ''Trypanosoma brucei rhodensiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense'', or combinations of these medications, can help treat this disease, but vaccines can not be used due to antigenic variation. \n\n== Supergroup ''Amoebozoa''==\n[[File:Amoebiasis; x-ray of colon. Photograph, 1930. Wellcome V0047842.jpg|thumb|X-ray of colon infected with ''E. histolytica'']]\n''[[Amoebozoa]]'' are characterized by the use of pseudopodia for movement and feeding. These protists reproduce by binary or multiple fission. \n\n=== Entamoebida ===\n[[Entamoebidae|Entamoebida]] lack mitochondria and possess mitosomes. ''Entamoeba histolytica'' is pathogenic. It causes amoebic dysentery, which is the third leading cause of parasitic deaths. It is diagnosed by obtaining stool samples<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/amebiasis/fact_sheet.htm|title=Amebiasis (amebic dysentery)|website=www.health.ny.gov|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. Amoebic dysentery is caused by consuming water contaminated with feces. The water ingested contains dormant cysts which then become active when consumed. Symptoms of this pathogen include diarrhea, which contain blood and mucus, and can alternate between constipation and remission, abdominal pain, and fever. Symptoms can progress to ameboma, fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon, and colonic ulcers and can lead to perforation. Amoebic dysentery can be treated with Ornidazole, Secnidazole, and Tinidazole. Tinidazole may be effective in curing children<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dans|first=Leonila F|last2=Mart\u00ednez|first2=Elizabeth G|date=2007-01-01|title=Amoebic dysentery|journal=BMJ Clinical Evidence|volume=2007|issn=1752-8526|pmc=2943803|pmid=19454043}}</ref>.\u00a0Amoebic meningoencephalitis and keratitis is a brain-eating amoeba caused by free-living ''Naeglaria'' and ''Acanthomoeba.'' One way this pathogen can be acquired is by soaking contact lenses in water instead of contact solution. This will result in progressive ulceration of the cornea<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/naegleria-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20375470|title=Naegleria infection - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. This pathogen can be diagnosed by demonstration of amoebae in clinical specimens. There is currently no drug therapy available for amoebic meningoencephalitis and keratitis.\n\n== Supergroup SAR ==\nThe supergroup SAR includes Rhizaria, Alveolata, and Stramenopiles and is distinguished by fine pseudopodia which can be branched, simple, or connected.\n\n=== Stramenopila ===\nSome members of ''[[Stramenopila]]'' are brown algae, diatoms, and water molds. An example of Stramenopila are ''Peronosporomycetes''. The most well-known example of ''Peronosporomycetes'' is ''Phytophthora infestans''. This organism caused the Irish potato famine in the 1850s<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://plantclinic.cornell.edu/factsheets/lateblight.pdf|title=Late Blight|last=|first=|date=2018|website=plantclinic.cornell.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \n\n=== Alveolata ===\n[[Alveolate|Alveolata]] is a large group, which includes Dinoflagellata, Ciliophora, and Apicomplexa. Dinoflagellates are protists whose toxins can affect the nervous system and they cause red tides.  \n[[File:Toxoplasmosis life cycle de.svg|thumb|Toxoplasmosis life cycle between humans and animals]]\n''Balantidium Coli'' (Balantidiasis) is an example of a member of the phylum Ciliophora.

Apicomplexans are parasites of animals and contain an arrangement of organelles called the apical complex. One example of an apicomplexan is Malaria. Five species of plasmodium cause malaria in animals. Malaria is transmitted by the bite of an infected female mosquito. Symptoms of malaria include: periodic chills and fever, anemia, and hypertrophy of the liver and spleen. Cerebral malaria can occur in children. In order to diagnose Malaria, doctors will look for parasites in Wright-or-Giemsa-stained red blood cells and serological tests. Treatment includes antimalarial drugs, however, resistance has been observed. New vaccines are being discovered to this day. Preventative measures that can be taken include sleeping with netting and using insecticide to prevent mosquitoes. Eimeria is another example of an apicomplexan pathogen. This pathogen causes cecal coccidiosis in chickens. Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease of the intestinal tract<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-barc/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/animal-parasitic-diseases-laboratory/docs/coccidiosis/|title=Coccidiosis : USDA ARS|website=www.ars.usda.gov|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>.  This disease is treated by placing anticoccidials in the chickens\u2019 feed. It also causes malabsorption, diarrhea, and sometimes bloody diarrhea in animals. ''Theileria parva & T. annulata'' are tick-borne parasites which cause fatal East Coast fever in cattle. East Coast fever is transmitted by the bite of the three-host tick ''Phipicephalus appendiculatus'' and results in respiratory failure and death in African cattle. Most hosts of ''P. appendiculatus'' succumb to pulmonary edema and die within three weeks of infection. The severity of the infection can be lessened by treatment with antiprotozoal drugs like buparvaquone. Toxoplasma causes toxoplasmosis and can be acquired from undercooked meat or cat feces containing ''Toxoplasma gondii''. The majority of the 60 million Americans infected with ''T. gondii'' are asymptomatic. The group most vulnerable to this pathogen are the fetuses of mothers who have been infected with the parasite for the first time during pregnancy. This can result in damage to the fetus\u2019s brain, eyes, and other organs. Treatment is available for pregnant women and the immunosuppressed<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/toxoplasmosis.html|title=Toxoplasmosis|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. Cryptosporidiosis can be contracted through contact with water, food, soil, or surfaces contaminated with feces containing the ''Cryptosporidium.'' Immunocompromised people are the most susceptible. Cryptosporidiosis causes watery diarrhea and can resolve itself without medical intervention. It is diagnosed by examining stool samples, and diarrhea can be treated using Nitazoxanide<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/general-info.html|title=General Information for the Public {{!}} Cryptosporidium {{!}} Parasites {{!}} CDC|date=2019-01-07|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>.\n\n=== Rhizaria ===\nPlasmodiophorids and Halosporidians are two examples of parasitic Rhizaria. Plasmodiophorids cause infections in crops such as ''Spongospora subterranea''. They cause powdery scabs and galls and disrupt growth. Halosporidians cause infections in marine invertebrates such as ''Mikrocytos mackini'' in Pacific oysters. ''Mikrocytos mackini'' are abscesses or green pustules on palps and mantles of certain molluscs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurl-mollusc.eu/Main-activities/Tutorials/Mikrocytos-mackini|title=Mikrocytos mackini|website=EURL for Molluscs Diseases|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. \n\n== Archaeplastida ==\nThe supergroup ''[[Archaeplastida]]'' includes red algae, green algae and land plants. Each of these three groups have multicellular species and the green and red algae have many single-celled species. The land plants are not considered protists<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://basicbiology.net/micro/microorganisms/protists|title=Protists|website=Basic Biology|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. \n\nRed algae are primarily multicellular, lack flagella, and range in size from microscopic, unicellular to large, multicellular forms. Some species of red algae contain phycoerythrins, photosynthetic accessory pigments that are red in color and outcompete the green tint of chlorophyll, making these species appear as varying shades of red. This group doesn\u2019t include many pathogens<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology2/chapter/archaeplastida/|title=Archaeplastida {{!}} Biology for Majors II|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>.\n\nGreen algae exhibit similar features to the land plants, particularly in terms of chloroplast structure. The green algae are subdivided into the chlorophytes and charophytes. It is very rare for green algae to become parasitic. \n\n''Prototheca moriformis'' belongs to the subdivision Chloroplastida. ''P. moriformis'' is a green algae that lacks chlorophyll and has turned to parasitism. It is found in sewage and the soil. ''P. moriformis'' causes a disease called protothecosis. This disease mainly infects cattle and dogs.

They are usually contracted by either an insect vector or by contact with an infected substance or surface and include organisms that are now classified in the supergroups [[Excavata]], [[Amoebozoa]], [[SAR supergroup|SAR]], and [[Archaeplastida]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Prescott's Microbiology|last=Wiley, Sandman, Wood|first=K, J, D|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\n\nProtozoan infections are responsible for diseases that affect many different types of organisms, including plants, animals, and some marine life. Many of the most prevalent and deadly human diseases are caused by a protozoan infection, including [[African trypanosomiasis|African Sleeping Sickness]], [[Amoebiasis|amoebic dysentery]], and [[malaria]].\n\nThe species originally termed \"protozoa\" are not closely related to each other and only have superficial similarities ([[eukaryotic]], [[unicellular]], [[motile]], though with exceptions). The terms \"protozoa\" (and [[protist]]) are usually discouraged in the modern [[biosciences]]. However, this terminology is still encountered in [[medicine]]. This is partially because of the conservative character of [[medical classification]] and partially due to the necessity of making identifications of organisms based upon morphology.\n\nWithin the taxonomic classification, the four protist supergroups (Amoebozoa, Excavata, SAR, and Archaeplastida) fall under the Domain Eukarya. Protists are an artificial grouping of over 64,000 different single-celled life forms. This means that it is difficult to define protists due to their extreme differences and uniqueness. Protists are a ''polyphyletic'' [(of a group of organisms) derived from more than one common evolutionary ancestor or ancestral group and therefore not suitable for placing in the same taxon]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polyphyletic|title=Definition of POLYPHYLETIC|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> a collection of organisms and they are unicellular, which means that they lack the level of tissue organization which is present in more complex eukaryotes. Protists grow in a wide variety of moist habitats and a majority of them are free-living organisms. In these moist environments, plankton and terrestrial forms can also be found. Protists are ''chemoorganotrophic'' [<nowiki/>[[organism]]s which oxidize the chemical bonds in [[organic compound]]s as their energy source]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chemoorganotrophic|title=Definition of CHEMOORGANOTROPHIC|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> and are responsible for recycling nitrogen and phosphorus. Parasites also are responsible for causing disease in humans and domesticated animals.\n\nProtozoa are ''chemoorganotrophic'' protists and have three different ways of acquiring nutrients. The first method of acquiring nutrients is through saprotrophic nutrition. In saprotrophic nutrition, nutrients are obtained from dead organic matter through enzymatic degradation. The second method of acquiring nutrients is through osmotrophic nutrition. In osmotrophic nutrition, nutrients are obtained through absorbing soluble products. The third method of acquiring nutrients is through holozoic nutrition. In holozoic nutrition, solid nutrients are absorbed through phagocytosis<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nSome protozoa are ''photoautotrophic'' protists. These protists include strict aerobes, and use photosystems I and II in order to carry out photosynthesis which produces oxygen<ref name=\":0\" />. \n[[File:Plasmodium-BIO FINAL (1).svg|thumb|Diagram of ''Plasmodium'' structure]]\n''Mixotrophic'' protists obtain nutrients through organic and inorganic carbon compounds simultaneously<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nAll cells have a plasma membrane. In a protist, the plasma membrane is also known as the plasmalemma. Just below the plasma membrane, and in the inner fluid region, cytoplasm can be found. The pellicle structure in the protist is a thin layer of protein that helps provide the cell with some support and protection.\u00a0 In addition to the plasma membrane, protists contain two different types of vacuoles. Contractile vacuoles help to maintain osmoregulation, and phagocytic vacuoles allow select protists to ingest food. In some protists, flagella and/or cilia may be present to help with motility and nutrient intake. The flagella/cilia create water currents that assist in feeding and respiration. Energy intake is necessary for protists\u2019 survival. Aerobic chemoorganotrophic protists produce energy through the use of their mitochondria. The mitochondria then generates energy for the protist to keep up with cellular life functions. Photosynthetic protists produce energy through the use of their mitochondria and chloroplasts. Finally, anaerobic chemoorganotrophs produce energy through the use of hydrogenosomes, which is a membrane enclosed organelle that releases molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nEncystment is when a protist becomes a dormant cyst with a cell wall; during encystment, the cyst has decreased complexity and metabolic activity relative to the protist. Encystment protects the protist from environmental changes, the cyst can be a site for nuclear reorganization and cell division, and it can act as a host cell in order to transfer parasitic species. Excystment is when a return to favorable conditions may cause a cyst to return to its original state. In parasitic protists, excystment may occur when the cyst is ingested by a new host<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nProtists reproduce asexually or sexually. If the protists reproduce asexually, they do so through binary fission, multiple fission, budding, and fragmentation. If the protists reproduce sexually, they do so through a syngamy process where there is a fusion of the gametes. If this occurs in an individual it is recognized as autogamy. If this occurs between individuals, it is known as conjugation<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n== Supergroup ''Excavata''==\n<br />''[[Excavata]]'' are considered primitive eukaryotes. They are characterized by a feeding groove with a posteriorly located flagella, which allows them to create a current that captures small food particles<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology2/chapter/excavata/|title=Excavata {{!}} Biology for Majors II|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. The cytostome is the specialized structure that allows the protists this function. This supergroup ''Excavata'' includes the subgroups ''Diplomonads (Fornicata)'', ''Parabasalids'', and ''Euglenozoans''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book:_General_Biology_(Boundless)/23:_Protists/23.3:_Groups_of_Protists/23.3A:_Excavata|title=23.3A: Excavata|last=|first=|date=|website=Lumen Learning|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11/12/2019}}</ref>. \n\n=== Diplomonads ===\n[[Diplomonad|Dipolomonads]] used to be defined as ''Fornicata'', but their characteristics remain the same despite their renaming. They are microaerophilic protists. ''Diplomonads'' were previously defined by the lack of a mitochondria, but recent studies have found that they have a nonfunctional, mitochondrial remnant organelle called a mitosome. Most are harmless except for ''Giardia'', ''Hexamita salmonis'', and ''Histomonas meleagridis''. ''Giardia'' causes diarrhea, ''Hexamita'' ''salmonis'' is a fish parasite, and ''Histomonas meleagridis'' is a turkey pathogen.\n\n''[[Giardia intestinalis]]'' is a human pathogen, which is transmitted by cyst contaminated water. It causes epidemic diarrhea from contaminated water. You can tell you may be infected by the observation of cysts or trophozoites in stools and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test. To prevent contamination, avoid any possibly contaminated water, and if contaminated water is the only thing available to drink, a slow sand filter should be used. A study found that the chlorination of water and nutritional intervention had no effect on childhood giardia infection. Only handwashing and hygienic sanitation interventions reduced infection rates in children<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Audrie|last2=Ercumen|first2=Ayse|last3=Benjamin-Chung|first3=Jade|last4=Arnold|first4=Benjamin F.|last5=Das|first5=Shimul|last6=Haque|first6=Rashidul|last7=Ashraf|first7=Sania|last8=Parvez|first8=Sarker M.|last9=Unicomb|first9=Leanne|last10=Rahman|first10=Mahbubur|last11=Hubbard|first11=Alan E.|date=2018-10-30|title=Effects of Water, Sanitation, Handwashing, and Nutritional Interventions on Child Enteric Protozoan Infections in Rural Bangladesh: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial|url=https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/67/10/1515/4969830|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=67|issue=10|pages=1515\u20131522|doi=10.1093/cid/ciy320|pmid=29669039|pmc=6206106|issn=1058-4838}}</ref>. \n\n''Hexamita'' ''salmonis'' is a common flagellated fish pathogen.

They lack a distinct cytostome, which means they must use phagocytosis to engulf food. There are two subgroups: ''Trichonympha'' and ''Trichomonadida''. ''Trichonympha'' are obligate mutualists of wood-eating insects such as termites. They secrete cellulose, which is used for digesting wood. The next subgroup, ''Trichomonadida'', does not require oxygen and possesses hydrogenosomes. They only reproduce through asexual reproduction and some strains are human pathogens. There are three types of pathogenic parabasalia: ''Trichomonas foetus, Dientamoeba fragilis'', and ''Trichomonas vaginalis''. ''Trichomonas foetus'' causes spontaneous abortion in cattle, ''Dientamoeba fragilis'' causes diarrhea in humans, and ''Trichomonas vaginalis'' is a sexually transmitted disease<ref name=\":0\" />.\n[[File:Tritrichomonas foetus (259 26) Cultured.jpg|thumb|Image of a cultured ''Tritrichomonas foetus'']]\n''Trichomonas foetus'' is a parasite that resides in the urogenital tract of cattle and causes bovine trichomoniasis.

No one knows how ''D. fragilis'' is spread, possibly due to swallowing contaminated water or food. Many people who are infected with this parasite, show no signs of being infected. Sometimes the infection can be observed, the most common symptoms include diarrhea, stomach pains, loss of appetite, nausea, and fatigue<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dientamoeba-fragilis-infection|title=Dientamoeba Fragilis Infection|website=WebMD|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. \n\n''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]'' is a sexually transmitted disease. Men who are infected rarely show any symptoms (asymptomatic). Women who are infected usually show signs of soreness, inflammation, and redness around the vagina and a possible change in vaginal discharge. ''Trichomonas vaginalis'' can be treated with a course of antibiotics<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/trichomoniasis.html|title=Trichomoniasis|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. \n\n=== Euglenozoa ===\nMost Euglenozoa are [[Phototroph|photoautotrophic]], but some are [[Chemoorganotroph|chemoorganotrophs]] (saprophytic). They are commonly found in freshwater. The members of the phylum Euglenozoa have a [[Pellicle (biology)|pellicle]] for support, a red eye spot called a stigma to orient the cell toward light, chlorophyll a and b to assist in the process of photosynthesis, contractile vacuoles, and flagella.\n[[File:Leishmania braziliensis Peru.jpg|thumb|''Leishmaniasis'' lesion on adult human forearm|260x260px]]\nOne major pathogen from the phylum Euglenozoa is ''Leishmania.''

This pathogen causes damage to the nervous system.\n\n[[African trypanosomiasis|African Sleeping Sickness]] is caused by ''Trypanosoma brucei rhodensiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense'', and is transmitted by the tsetse fly. It is diagnosed by a physical exam and blood test.  African sleeping sickness causes interstitial inflammation, lethargy, brain swelling, and death within one to three years. Drug therapy, using Eflornithine and Melarsoprol Pentamidine for ''T. gambiense'' and Suramin(Antrypol) for either ''Trypanosoma brucei rhodensiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense'', or combinations of these medications, can help treat this disease, but vaccines can not be used due to antigenic variation. \n\n== Supergroup ''Amoebozoa''==\n[[File:Amoebiasis; x-ray of colon. Photograph, 1930. Wellcome V0047842.jpg|thumb|X-ray of colon infected with ''E. histolytica'']]\n''[[Amoebozoa]]'' are characterized by the use of pseudopodia for movement and feeding. These protists reproduce by binary or multiple fission. \n\n=== Entamoebida ===\n[[Entamoebidae|Entamoebida]] lack mitochondria and possess mitosomes. ''Entamoeba histolytica'' is pathogenic. It causes amoebic dysentery, which is the third leading cause of parasitic deaths. It is diagnosed by obtaining stool samples<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/amebiasis/fact_sheet.htm|title=Amebiasis (amebic dysentery)|website=www.health.ny.gov|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. Amoebic dysentery is caused by consuming water contaminated with feces. The water ingested contains dormant cysts which then become active when consumed. Symptoms of this pathogen include diarrhea, which contain blood and mucus, and can alternate between constipation and remission, abdominal pain, and fever. Symptoms can progress to ameboma, fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon, and colonic ulcers and can lead to perforation. Amoebic dysentery can be treated with Ornidazole, Secnidazole, and Tinidazole. Tinidazole may be effective in curing children<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dans|first=Leonila F|last2=Mart\u00ednez|first2=Elizabeth G|date=2007-01-01|title=Amoebic dysentery|journal=BMJ Clinical Evidence|volume=2007|issn=1752-8526|pmc=2943803|pmid=19454043}}</ref>.\u00a0Amoebic meningoencephalitis and keratitis is a brain-eating amoeba caused by free-living ''Naeglaria'' and ''Acanthomoeba.'' One way this pathogen can be acquired is by soaking contact lenses in water instead of contact solution. This will result in progressive ulceration of the cornea<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/naegleria-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20375470|title=Naegleria infection - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. This pathogen can be diagnosed by demonstration of amoebae in clinical specimens. There is currently no drug therapy available for amoebic meningoencephalitis and keratitis.\n\n== Supergroup SAR ==\nThe supergroup SAR includes Rhizaria, Alveolata, and Stramenopiles and is distinguished by fine pseudopodia which can be branched, simple, or connected.\n\n=== Stramenopila ===\nSome members of ''[[Stramenopila]]'' are brown algae, diatoms, and water molds. An example of Stramenopila are ''Peronosporomycetes''. The most well-known example of ''Peronosporomycetes'' is ''Phytophthora infestans''. This organism caused the Irish potato famine in the 1850s<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://plantclinic.cornell.edu/factsheets/lateblight.pdf|title=Late Blight|last=|first=|date=2018|website=plantclinic.cornell.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \n\n=== Alveolata ===\n[[Alveolate|Alveolata]] is a large group, which includes Dinoflagellata, Ciliophora, and Apicomplexa. Dinoflagellates are protists whose toxins can affect the nervous system and they cause red tides.  \n[[File:Toxoplasmosis life cycle de.svg|thumb|Toxoplasmosis life cycle between humans and animals]]\n''Balantidium Coli'' (Balantidiasis) is an example of a member of the phylum Ciliophora. Balantidiasis is the only ciliate known to be capable of infecting humans, and swine are the primary reservoir host<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/balantidium/biology.html|title=CDC - Balatidiasis - Biology|last=Prevention|first=CDC-Centers for Disease Control and|date=2019-06-12|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. Balantidiasis is opportunistic and rare in Western countries<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/809/balantidiasis|title=Balantidiasis {{!}} Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) \u2013 an NCATS Program|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>.  Apicomplexans are parasites of animals and contain an arrangement of organelles called the apical complex. One example of an apicomplexan is Malaria. Five species of plasmodium cause malaria in animals. Malaria is transmitted by the bite of an infected female mosquito. Symptoms of malaria include: periodic chills and fever, anemia, and hypertrophy of the liver and spleen. Cerebral malaria can occur in children. In order to diagnose Malaria, doctors will look for parasites in Wright-or-Giemsa-stained red blood cells and serological tests. Treatment includes antimalarial drugs, however, resistance has been observed. New vaccines are being discovered to this day. Preventative measures that can be taken include sleeping with netting and using insecticide to prevent mosquitoes. Eimeria is another example of an apicomplexan pathogen. This pathogen causes cecal coccidiosis in chickens. Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease of the intestinal tract<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-barc/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/animal-parasitic-diseases-laboratory/docs/coccidiosis/|title=Coccidiosis : USDA ARS|website=www.ars.usda.gov|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>.  This disease is treated by placing anticoccidials in the chickens\u2019 feed. It also causes malabsorption, diarrhea, and sometimes bloody diarrhea in animals. ''Theileria parva & T. annulata'' are tick-borne parasites which cause fatal East Coast fever in cattle. East Coast fever is transmitted by the bite of the three-host tick ''Phipicephalus appendiculatus'' and results in respiratory failure and death in African cattle. Most hosts of ''P. appendiculatus'' succumb to pulmonary edema and die within three weeks of infection. The severity of the infection can be lessened by treatment with antiprotozoal drugs like buparvaquone. Toxoplasma causes toxoplasmosis and can be acquired from undercooked meat or cat feces containing ''Toxoplasma gondii''. The majority of the 60 million Americans infected with ''T. gondii'' are asymptomatic. The group most vulnerable to this pathogen are the fetuses of mothers who have been infected with the parasite for the first time during pregnancy. This can result in damage to the fetus\u2019s brain, eyes, and other organs. Treatment is available for pregnant women and the immunosuppressed<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/toxoplasmosis.html|title=Toxoplasmosis|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. Cryptosporidiosis can be contracted through contact with water, food, soil, or surfaces contaminated with feces containing the ''Cryptosporidium.'' Immunocompromised people are the most susceptible. Cryptosporidiosis causes watery diarrhea and can resolve itself without medical intervention. It is diagnosed by examining stool samples, and diarrhea can be treated using Nitazoxanide<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/general-info.html|title=General Information for the Public {{!}} Cryptosporidium {{!}} Parasites {{!}} CDC|date=2019-01-07|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>.\n\n=== Rhizaria ===\nPlasmodiophorids and Halosporidians are two examples of parasitic Rhizaria. Plasmodiophorids cause infections in crops such as ''Spongospora subterranea''. They cause powdery scabs and galls and disrupt growth. Halosporidians cause infections in marine invertebrates such as ''Mikrocytos mackini'' in Pacific oysters. ''Mikrocytos mackini'' are abscesses or green pustules on palps and mantles of certain molluscs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurl-mollusc.eu/Main-activities/Tutorials/Mikrocytos-mackini|title=Mikrocytos mackini|website=EURL for Molluscs Diseases|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. \n\n== Archaeplastida ==\nThe supergroup ''[[Archaeplastida]]'' includes red algae, green algae and land plants. Each of these three groups have multicellular species and the green and red algae have many single-celled species. The land plants are not considered protists<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://basicbiology.net/micro/microorganisms/protists|title=Protists|website=Basic Biology|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>. \n\nRed algae are primarily multicellular, lack flagella, and range in size from microscopic, unicellular to large, multicellular forms. Some species of red algae contain phycoerythrins, photosynthetic accessory pigments that are red in color and outcompete the green tint of chlorophyll, making these species appear as varying shades of red. This group doesn\u2019t include many pathogens<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology2/chapter/archaeplastida/|title=Archaeplastida {{!}} Biology for Majors II|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>.\n\nGreen algae exhibit similar features to the land plants, particularly in terms of chloroplast structure. The green algae are subdivided into the chlorophytes and charophytes. It is very rare for green algae to become parasitic. \n\n''Prototheca moriformis'' belongs to the subdivision Chloroplastida. ''P. moriformis'' is a green algae that lacks chlorophyll and has turned to parasitism. It is found in sewage and the soil. ''P. moriformis'' causes a disease called protothecosis. This disease mainly infects cattle and dogs. Cattle can be affected by protothecal enteritis and mastitis<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Osterstock|first=Jason B.|last2=Mansell|first2=Joanne L.|last3=Roussel|first3=Allen J.|date=2005-11-01|title=Protothecal enteritis as a cause of protein-losing enteropathy in a bull|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=227|issue=9|pages=1476\u20131479, 1418|doi=10.2460/javma.2005.227.1476|issn=0003-1488|pmid=16279394}}</ref>.

The plaintiffs, Michael Moore (not the [[Michael Moore|famous filmmaker]]), Mary Shepard and the Second Amendment Foundation, sought an injunction against Illinois attorney general [[Lisa Madigan]], Illinois Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Patrick Quinn]], and other named defendants, barring them from enforcing two key provisions of the Illinois Statutes prohibiting public possession of a firearm or other weapon.\n\nThe case was initially dismissed by the Illinois Federal District Court, but a 3-judge panel of the 7th Circuit reversed, and an [[en banc]] rehearing was declined by the full Circuit. Madigan and other named Defendants were considering an appeal to the [[United States Supreme Court]] prior to July 2013, but the legal case became [[mootness|mooted]] once the Illinois legislature passed a ''[[shall issue]]'' concealed carry law that month.\n\n==Background==\nIllinois State Statutes \u00a7720 ILCS 5/24-1 and \u00a7720 ILCS 5/24-1.6 define the crimes of \"Unlawful Use of Weapons\" and \"Aggravated Unlawful Use of Weapons\". In part, they state that a person commits a gross [[misdemeanor]] when he knowingly \"Carries or possesses in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person except when on his land or in his own abode, legal dwelling, or fixed place of business, or on the land or in the legal dwelling of another person as an invitee with that person\u2019s permission, any pistol, revolver, stun gun or taser or other firearm . . . or . . . Carries or possesses on or about his person, upon any public street, alley, or other public lands within the corporate limits of a city, village or incorporated town, except when an invitee thereon or therein, for the purpose of the display of such weapon or the lawful commerce in weapons, or except when on his land or in his own abode, legal dwelling, or fixed place of business, or on the land or in the legal dwelling of another person as an invitee with that person\u2019s permission, any pistol, revolver, stun gun or taser or other firearm...\". The offense is a Class 4 [[felony]] for a first offense and a Class 2 felony thereafter under the \"Aggravated\" variation if, at any time, the weapon possessed by the person was uncased and either loaded or with the ammunition \"immediately accessible\". Coupled with lack of exemption based on a carry permit, the like of which did not exist in Illinois, the Statutes effectively prohibit all forms of defensive weapons carry by private citizens.\n\n===Shepard v. Madigan, 11-CV-405-WDS===\nIn 2009, Mary E. Shepard, a member of the advocacy group the Illinois State Rifle Association, was performing volunteer duties as treasurer at her church, when she was assaulted and beaten by an intruder and left for dead. Her injuries were numerous and major, including skull fractures, hearing loss, shattered teeth, and vertebral damage, which required many surgeries and extensive physical therapy. An 83-year-old coworker, unnamed in the suit, was also brutalized and badly injured in the attack. Despite possessing a handgun and maintaining the State-required Firearms Owner Identification card (FOID), Shepard was unarmed as required by Illinois statutes during the attack, and asserts that if she had had access to her weapon, she could have fought off her assailant and avoided the injuries to herself and her co-worker. Shepard and the Second Amendment Foundation filed suit in 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, seeking an injunction barring Lisa Madigan, in her capacity as Attorney General for the State of Illinois, from enforcing the sections of the Illinois State Statutes that prohibit public carry of a loaded, functional firearm.<ref name=\"ShepardOrder\">[http://www.nraila.org/media/6380581/memorandum_and_order._pdf.pdf Shepard v.

Madigan, 11-CV-03134===\nOn May 12, 2011, plaintiffs Michael Moore, Charles Hooks, IllinoisCarry, and the Second Amendment Foundation filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, Springfield Division, alleging that the same areas of the Illinois State Statutes mentioned in ''Shepard'' were facially violative of the [[U.S. Constitution]], specifically the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] as interpreted by the landmark Supreme Court Cases [[D.C. v. Heller]] and [[McDonald v. Chicago]], and sought an injunction barring enforcement of the statutes.<ref name=\"MooreDistrictComplaint\">[https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.ilcd.52015 Moore v. Madigan - Complaint, USDC, CD Illinois, Springfield Div.]</ref>\n\nMoore, a Cook County Sheriff's Deputy who retired after 30 years of service, had attempted to obtain the ability to carry a concealed firearm as a retired law enforcement officer under HR 218, the [[Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act]], but Cook County Sheriff [[Tom Dart]] declined to issue him one, stating that Deputy Moore had been employed as a corrections deputy, not a \"road\" deputy and did not meet the standard. In 2010, Moore and four other retired officers filed a suit in Federal Court against the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board (the agency that administers LEOSA in Illinois) challenging the ID card requirement of LEOSA.<ref>[https://casetext.com/case/moore-v-trent/ ''Moore v. Trent'', 09 C 1712. (N.D. Ill. Dec. 16, 2010)], ''Casetext''. Retrieved April 19, 2017.</ref> The Court ruled that the plaintiffs had no standing, specifically \"absent clear statutory intent, a court is precluded from creating a private right of action...\" and that \"LEOSA does not provide for a mechanism enabling Plaintiffs to sue\".\n\n==District Court==\nIn an opinion dated March 30, 2012, Judge William D. Stiehl, presiding for the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Illinois, dismissed the complaint in ''Shepard v. Madigan''. Among his findings were that the ''Heller'', ''McDonald'' and subsequent relevant 7th Circuit decisions failed to address the specific assertion of the Plaintiffs, specifically that the right to keep and bear arms outside one's own home is a \"core\" protection of the Second Amendment (one whose restriction would be subject to [[strict scrutiny]] upon review). Absent such decision, and with text from ''Heller'' stating that the historical review in that case did not support the claim that \"the Second Amendment necessarily extends the right to keep and bear arms to the unfettered right to carry weapons in public\", Judge Stiehl asserted that in fact this right is not a \"core\" protected right of the Second Amendment, and therefore the purpose of the Illinois Statutes, to reduce gun-related crime by restricting the carry of weapons in public to law enforcement officers only, is \"reasonably adapted to a substantial government interest\" as required by [[intermediate scrutiny]], and is thus constitutional.<ref name=\"ShepardOrder\"/>\n\nSimilarly, in ''Moore v.

Therefore, the court found, the Plaintiffs would be unlikely to prevail with their lawsuit, and so the preliminary injunction motion was denied.

Madigan - 7th Circuit Opinion and Order]</ref>\n\nIn a 2-1 decision (Williams dissenting), the court reversed both District Courts' decisions and orders. Judge Posner, writing for the majority, notes that while the ''Heller'' and ''McDonald'' decisions did say that the need for self-defense is most acute inside the home, that doesn't mean it is not also acute outside the home. \"Confrontations are not limited to the home\".<ref name=\"CircuitDecision\"/> The distinct use of the words \"keep\" and \"bear\" in the text of the Second Amendment, the court reasoned, implied the right to carry outside one's home, as in historical context, the meaning of the word did not limit it to the home and it would be awkward to attempt to assign that connotation to documents of the time period. The court also reasoned that this limitation would not have been rational as of the ratification of the Bill of Rights, because in what was then the Wild West - including the Ohio River Valley - settlers would have had to contend with native Indians, and such confrontations would be more likely, and more dangerous to an unarmed settler, outside the home rather than in. This negated the Defendants/Appellees' claim that the Blackstone writings and other documents of English origin pointed to a more [[castle doctrine]]-based interpretation of the Second Amendment as it would have been understood by the American colonists. While twenty-first century Illinois has no marauding Indian tribes, the threat, from gangs and street thugs, continues, and, says the decision, \"a Chicagoan is a good deal more likely to be attacked on a sidewalk in a rough neighborhood than in his apartment on the 35th floor of the Park Tower.\"\n\nThe decision also rejected the argument that the Illinois laws had an effect on gun crime, noting that Chicago's criminal element was undeterred by the ban on handguns overturned by ''McDonald''. Citing the study, \"Firearms Laws and the Reduction of Violence: A Systematic Review\", and several other published studies, the court found that evidence did not support a link between gun regulations and crime rates in either direction. The court, again from the ''Heller'' decision, stated \"Anyway the Supreme Court made clear in Heller that it wasn\u2019t going to make the right to bear arms depend on casualty counts. (554 U.S. at 636). If the mere possibility that allowing guns to be carried in public would increase the crime or death rates sufficed to justify a ban,  Heller would have been decided the other way, for that possibility was as great in the District of Columbia as it is in Illinois.\"\n\nAs such, the court held that although the State of Illinois would logically have a substantial interest in reducing gun-related crime and injury/death, the carry ban is not reasonably adapted to this goal and therefore fails even [[intermediate scrutiny]].\n\nThe Circuit Court ordered the cases remanded to their respective District Courts, with orders that those courts find the laws unconstitutional and institute permanent injunctions. However, as they realized this would leave the State virtually without any gun laws at all (the overwhelming majority of its policy on the subject hinging on these two overturned sections of law), the Court of Appeals stayed these mandates for 180 days, allowing the Illinois Legislature sufficient time to attempt to craft a law that met constitutional review, implying that such laws would have to allow the public carry of firearms in some form. That 180-day stay expires on June 8, 2013; should the Legislature not act by that time, the injunction would take effect and the State of Illinois would technically become an \"unrestricted\" state with regard to concealed carry.\n\nOn March 13, 2013, the 7th Circuit denied the Defendants' petition for [[en banc]] rehearing before the full 10-judge Court, tacitly affirming the panel decision. Four of the ten judges dissented in that decision.\n\nOn April 29, 2013 Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan asked the Supreme Court of the United States for an extension to file a writ of certiorari.<ref name=\"extension\">[http://capitolfax.com/093565_9900001.00000_20130429120156617_00000001-c.pdf Moore v.

However, in concession to the interests of the Chicago area, mass transit buses and trains, schools, other government buildings, parks, hospitals and street festivals are designated \"gun-free\". The bill passed both the State House and Senate by large margins (89-28 and 45-12 respectively, well over the 2/3 margin required to override a veto), but as of June 11, still awaited action by Governor Patrick Quinn, named in ''Moore'' and who supports an appeal to SCOTUS.<ref>{{cite news |title=Concealed Carry Bill Sent to Governor |url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/illinois-concealed-carry-5/1973448/ |accessdate=31 March 2020 |publisher=NBC Chicago |date=May 31, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331112056/https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/illinois-concealed-carry-5/1973448/ |archivedate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn June 4, the 7th Circuit issued one 30-day extension of the original stay, allowing Governor Quinn and his staff time to review the law passed by the Legislature and decide on a course of action.

The plaintiffs, Michael Moore (not the [[Michael Moore|famous filmmaker]]), Mary Shepard and the Second Amendment Foundation, sought an injunction against Illinois attorney general [[Lisa Madigan]], Illinois Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Patrick Quinn]], and other named defendants, barring them from enforcing two key provisions of the Illinois Statutes prohibiting public possession of a firearm or other weapon.\n\nThe case was initially dismissed by the Illinois Federal District Court, but a 3-judge panel of the 7th Circuit reversed, and an [[en banc]] rehearing was declined by the full Circuit. Madigan and other named Defendants were considering an appeal to the [[United States Supreme Court]] prior to July 2013, but the legal case became [[mootness|mooted]] once the Illinois legislature passed a ''[[shall issue]]'' concealed carry law that month.\n\n==Background==\nIllinois State Statutes \u00a7720 ILCS 5/24-1 and \u00a7720 ILCS 5/24-1.6 define the crimes of \"Unlawful Use of Weapons\" and \"Aggravated Unlawful Use of Weapons\". In part, they state that a person commits a gross [[misdemeanor]] when he knowingly \"Carries or possesses in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person except when on his land or in his own abode, legal dwelling, or fixed place of business, or on the land or in the legal dwelling of another person as an invitee with that person\u2019s permission, any pistol, revolver, stun gun or taser or other firearm . . . or . . . Carries or possesses on or about his person, upon any public street, alley, or other public lands within the corporate limits of a city, village or incorporated town, except when an invitee thereon or therein, for the purpose of the display of such weapon or the lawful commerce in weapons, or except when on his land or in his own abode, legal dwelling, or fixed place of business, or on the land or in the legal dwelling of another person as an invitee with that person\u2019s permission, any pistol, revolver, stun gun or taser or other firearm...\". The offense is a Class 4 [[felony]] for a first offense and a Class 2 felony thereafter under the \"Aggravated\" variation if, at any time, the weapon possessed by the person was uncased and either loaded or with the ammunition \"immediately accessible\". Coupled with lack of exemption based on a carry permit, the like of which did not exist in Illinois, the Statutes effectively prohibit all forms of defensive weapons carry by private citizens.\n\n===Shepard v. Madigan, 11-CV-405-WDS===\nIn 2009, Mary E. Shepard, a member of the advocacy group the Illinois State Rifle Association, was performing volunteer duties as treasurer at her church, when she was assaulted and beaten by an intruder and left for dead. Her injuries were numerous and major, including skull fractures, hearing loss, shattered teeth, and vertebral damage, which required many surgeries and extensive physical therapy. An 83-year-old coworker, unnamed in the suit, was also brutalized and badly injured in the attack. Despite possessing a handgun and maintaining the State-required Firearms Owner Identification card (FOID), Shepard was unarmed as required by Illinois statutes during the attack, and asserts that if she had had access to her weapon, she could have fought off her assailant and avoided the injuries to herself and her co-worker. Shepard and the Second Amendment Foundation filed suit in 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, seeking an injunction barring Lisa Madigan, in her capacity as Attorney General for the State of Illinois, from enforcing the sections of the Illinois State Statutes that prohibit public carry of a loaded, functional firearm.<ref name=\"ShepardOrder\">[http://www.nraila.org/media/6380581/memorandum_and_order._pdf.pdf Shepard v.

Madigan, 11-CV-03134===\nOn May 12, 2011, plaintiffs Michael Moore, Charles Hooks, IllinoisCarry, and the Second Amendment Foundation filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, Springfield Division, alleging that the same areas of the Illinois State Statutes mentioned in ''Shepard'' were facially violative of the [[U.S. Constitution]], specifically the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] as interpreted by the landmark Supreme Court Cases [[D.C. v. Heller]] and [[McDonald v. Chicago]], and sought an injunction barring enforcement of the statutes.<ref name=\"MooreDistrictComplaint\">[https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.ilcd.52015 Moore v.

Among his findings were that the ''Heller'', ''McDonald'' and subsequent relevant 7th Circuit decisions failed to address the specific assertion of the Plaintiffs, specifically that the right to keep and bear arms outside one's own home is a \"core\" protection of the Second Amendment (one whose restriction would be subject to [[strict scrutiny]] upon review).

The bill passed both the State House and Senate by large margins (89-28 and 45-12 respectively, well over the 2/3 margin required to override a veto), but as of June 11, still awaited action by Governor Patrick Quinn, named in ''Moore'' and who supports an appeal to SCOTUS.<ref>{{cite news |title=Concealed Carry Bill Sent to Governor |url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/illinois-concealed-carry-5/1973448/ |accessdate=31 March 2020 |publisher=NBC Chicago |date=May 31, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331112056/https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/illinois-concealed-carry-5/1973448/ |archivedate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn June 4, the 7th Circuit issued one 30-day extension of the original stay, allowing Governor Quinn and his staff time to review the law passed by the Legislature and decide on a course of action. The 7th Circuit's ruling invalidating former Illinois law did not take effect until July 9, 2013. The court indicated it would not extend the stay again, so were the law not passed, in order for the State to maintain the ban, SCOTUS would have had to stay the Circuit Court's ruling.\n\nOn July 9, 2013 the Illinois General Assembly voted to override Governor Quinn's veto of the bill passed in early June, now giving Illinois a legal framework for issuing [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed carry permits]].\nIllinois was the last [[U.S. state]] to allow concealed carry of guns.<ref>{{cite web |title=Illinois Firearm Concealed Carry Act Will Require Employers to Take Action |url=http://www.hklaw.com/publications/Illinois-Firearm-Concealed-Carry-Act-Will-Require-Employers-to-Take-Action-08-05-2013/ |publisher=Holland & Koch |accessdate=November 4, 2013 |author=Todd D.
