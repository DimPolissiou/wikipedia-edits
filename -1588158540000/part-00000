The single, released on July 10, 1967, was a number-one hit in the US within three weeks of release and a big international seller. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked the record as the No. 3 song of the year.<ref>{{cite journal |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |title=Top Records of 1967 |date=December 30, 1967 |page=42 |volume=79 |issue=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSgEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref> The song notably kept the [[The Supremes|Diana Ross & the Supremes]] number \"[[Reflections (The Supremes song)|Reflections]]\" from becoming the group's 11th number-one single in the U.S. The recording remained on the Billboard chart for 20 weeks and was the Number 1 song for four weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/bobbie-gentry/chart-history/hot-100/song/574965|title=Bobbie Gentry: Chart Performance|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt generated eight [[Grammy]] nominations, resulting in three wins for Gentry and one for arranger [[Jimmie Haskell]].<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=Ode%20to%20Billie%20Joe&winner=&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1 ]{{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> \"Ode to Billie Joe\" has since made ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s lists of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\" and the \"100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time\" and ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"200 Best Songs of the 1960s\".<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/100-greatest-country-songs-of-all-time-20140601/47-bobbie-gentry-ode-to-billie-joe-1967-0849545</ref><ref>https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/6405-the-200-greatest-songs-of-the-1960s/?page=3#144</ref>\n\nThe song takes the form of a [[first-person narrative]] performed over sparse acoustic accompaniment, though with strings in the background. It tells of a [[Mississippi Delta|rural Mississippi]] family's reaction to the news of the [[suicide]] of Billie Joe McAllister, a local boy to whom the daughter (and narrator) is connected. Hearsay around the \"Tallahatchie Bridge\" forms the narrative and musical [[hook (music)|hook]]. The song concludes with the demise of the father and the lingering, singular effects of the two deaths on the family. According to Gentry, the song is about \"basic indifference, the casualness of people in moments of tragedy\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Life of a Song: \u2018Ode to Billie Joe\u2019 |date=July 1, 2016 |publisher=Financial Times |url=https://www.ft.com/content/38c27b36-3234-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153 |access-date=February 21, 2020 |quote=The atmospheric production\u2019s juxtaposition of banalities against profound loss struck a chord in the America of 1967}}</ref>\n\n==Narrative==\nGentry's song takes the form of [[first-person narrative]] by the young daughter of a white [[Mississippi Delta]] family. It offers fragments of the dinnertime conversation on the day that a local white boy, an acquaintance of the narrator, jumped to his death from a nearby bridge, the account interspersed between everyday, polite, mealtime conversation. The song's final verse conveys the passage of events over the following year.\n\nThe song begins on June 3 with the narrator, her brother and her father returning from farming chores to the family house for dinner.<ref>In much of the American farming community, \"dinner\" is the largest meal of the day, and is served at noon.</ref> After cautioning them about tracking in dirt, Mama says that she \"got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge\" that \"Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\". At the dinner table, the father seems unmoved, commenting, \"Billie Joe never had a lick o' sense\", before asking for the biscuits and adding that there's \"five more acres in the lower forty, I've got to [[plowing|plow]].\" Her brother is intrigued (\"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday ... And now you tell me Billie Joe has jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\"), but not enough to be distracted from the lunchtime meal. He recalls a prank that he, \"Tom\", and Billie Joe played on the narrator.\n\nThe only person affected is the narrator; one reviewer commented on \"the narrator's family's emotional distance, impassive and unmoved by Billie Joe's death\".<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\">https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/trying-to-unearth-the-story-behind-the-reclusive-bobbie-gentry-s-ode-to-billie-joe-1.2175285</ref> Her mother notices her change of mood following the news (\"Child, what's happened to your appetite? I've been cookin' all mornin' and you haven't touched a single bite\"). The mother shares the news that a local preacher visited earlier and, as an aside, adds that he mentioned seeing someone looking much like the narrator and Billie Joe \"throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\". In the song's final verse, a year has passed. The narrator's brother has married Becky Thompson and has moved to another town (\"bought a store in Tupelo\"). The father died from a viral infection and the mother is despondent (\"Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything\"). The narrator likewise remains privately affected: she often visits Choctaw Ridge collecting flowers to \"drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge\".<ref>https://www.songfacts.com/facts/bobbie-gentry/ode-to-billie-joe</ref>\n\n===Composer's view===\nQuestions arose among listeners: what did Billie Joe and his girlfriend throw off the Tallahatchie Bridge, and why did Billie Joe commit suicide? Speculation ran rampant after the song hit the airwaves. Gentry said in a November 1967 interview that it was the question most asked of her by everyone she met. She said that the most named items were flowers, an engagement ring, a draft card, a bottle of [[LSD]] pills, and an aborted baby. Although she knew what the item was, she would not reveal it, saying only \"Suppose it was a wedding ring.\"\n\n<blockquote>\"It's in there for two reasons,\" she said. \"First, it locks up a definite relationship between Billie Joe and the girl telling the story, the girl at the table. Second, the fact that Billie Joe was seen throwing something off the bridge \u2013 no matter what it was \u2013 provides a possible motivation as to why he jumped off the bridge the next day.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=5y95FQUaxGgC&dat=19671119&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=An Actress with a Big Secret|newspaper=Oxnard Press-Courier|date=November 19, 1967|page=42|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen [[Herman Raucher]] met Gentry in preparation for writing a novel and screenplay based on the song, she said that she had no idea why Billie Joe killed himself.<ref name=studer/> Gentry has, however, commented elsewhere on the song, saying that it is about indifference:<ref name=odeto>{{cite web |title=Biography |publisher=[[Yahoo!

The story of Billie Joe has two more interesting underlying themes. First, the illustration of a group of people's reactions to the life and death of Billie Joe, and its subsequent effect on their lives, is made. Second, the obvious gap between the girl and her mother is shown when both women experience a common loss (first Billie Joe, and later, Papa), and yet Mama and the girl are unable to recognize their mutual loss or share their grief.}}\n\nA commentary published in 2017 in a British newspaper made this comment: \"Fifty years on we're no wiser as to why Billie Joe did what he did and in the context of the song and Gentry's intentions, that's just as it should be\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=Ross|title=12 essential songs that defined 1967|date=18 May 2017 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/12-essential-songs-that-defined-1967-the-beatles-the-rolling-stones-jimi-hendrix-the-kinks-a7740636.html |work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge mentioned in this song collapsed in June 1972 after a fire.<ref name=NME/>\nIt crossed the [[Tallahatchie River]] at [[Money, Mississippi|Money]], about ten miles (16&nbsp;km) north of [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], and has since been rebuilt.

The original recording of \"Ode to Billie Joe\", with no other musicians backing Gentry's guitar according to some reports, had eleven verses lasting eight minutes,<ref>https://www.ft.com/content/38c27b36-3234-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153</ref> telling more of Billie Joe's story. The executives realized that this song would work best as a single, so they cut the length by almost half and added background music, strings, two cellos and four violins, according to Gentry.<ref name=\"performingsongwriter.com\"/>\n\nThe only surviving draft of the seven-minute version of \"Ode to Billie Joe\", which consists of two handwritten pages, is located in the archive of the University of Mississippi.<ref>\n[http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe].</ref> Gentry donated the draft to the University's Faulkner room in 1973.<ref>\n[https://spinditty.com/artists-bands/ode-to-billie-joe The Story Behind the Song \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry].</ref><ref>[ https://olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe]</ref>\n\nThe first page has been published and includes these words not in the final recording.<ref>[https://olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe]</ref><blockquote>\n\"People don't see Sally Jane in town anymore ...

No one really knows what went on up at Choctaw Ridge ... The day that Billy Jo McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn addition to the iconic lyrics that made the final cut, the unused lyrics may showcase Bobbie Gentry's mindset and possible answer to the mystery of what was thrown from the bridge; as well as the narrator's relationship to Billie Joe.  The shorter version left more of the story to the listener's imagination, and made the single more suitable for radio airplay.<ref>[http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-bobbie-gentry.php Bobbie Gentry artist biography] at CountryPolitan.com, now offline.

The poster's tagline, which treats the film as being based on a true story and gives a date of death for Billy (June 3, 1953), led many to believe that the song was based on actual events.<ref name=studer>{{cite book |last=Studer |first=Wayne |title=Rock on The Wild Side: gay male images in popular music of the rock era |publisher=Leyland Publications |year=1994 |pages=97\u201398}}</ref> In Raucher's novel and screenplay, Billy Joe kills himself after a drunken homosexual experience, and the object thrown from the bridge is the narrator's ragdoll. The film was released in 1976, directed and produced by [[Max Baer, Jr]], and starring [[Robby Benson]] and [[Glynnis O'Connor]]. Only the first, second, and fifth verses were sung by Bobbie Gentry in the film, omitting the third and fourth verses.\n\nIn the novel, the ragdoll is the central character's confidant and advisor.  Tossing it off the bridge symbolizes throwing away her childhood and innocence, becoming a self-contained adult.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/menlikethatsouth00howa|url-access=registration|quote=Ode to billy joe ragdoll.|title=Men Like That: A Southern Queer History |date=November 1999|author=John Howard |page=[https://archive.org/details/menlikethatsouth00howa/page/349 349] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |ISBN=9780226354705 |access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural impact==\nSoon after the song's chart success, the Tallahatchie Bridge was visited by more individuals who wanted to jump off it.

Hearsay around the \"Tallahatchie Bridge\" forms the narrative and musical [[hook (music)|hook]]. The song concludes with the demise of the father and the lingering, singular effects of the two deaths on the family.

It offers fragments of the dinnertime conversation on the day that a local white boy, an acquaintance of the narrator, jumped to his death from a nearby bridge, the account interspersed between everyday, polite, mealtime conversation. The song's final verse conveys the passage of events over the following year.\n\nThe song begins on June 3 with the narrator, her brother and her father returning from farming chores to the family house for dinner.<ref>In much of the American farming community, \"dinner\" is the largest meal of the day, and is served at noon.</ref> After cautioning them about tracking in dirt, Mama says that she \"got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge\" that \"Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\". At the dinner table, the father seems unmoved, commenting, \"Billie Joe never had a lick o' sense\", before asking for the biscuits and adding that there's \"five more acres in the lower forty, I've got to [[plowing|plow]].\" Her brother is intrigued (\"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday ... And now you tell me Billie Joe has jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\"), but not enough to be distracted from the lunchtime meal. He recalls a prank that he, \"Tom\", and Billie Joe played on the narrator.\n\nThe only person affected is the narrator; one reviewer commented on \"the narrator's family's emotional distance, impassive and unmoved by Billie Joe's death\".<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\">https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/trying-to-unearth-the-story-behind-the-reclusive-bobbie-gentry-s-ode-to-billie-joe-1.2175285</ref> Her mother notices her change of mood following the news (\"Child, what's happened to your appetite? I've been cookin' all mornin' and you haven't touched a single bite\"). The mother shares the news that a local preacher visited earlier and, as an aside, adds that he mentioned seeing someone looking much like the narrator and Billie Joe \"throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\". In the song's final verse, a year has passed. The narrator's brother has married Becky Thompson and has moved to another town (\"bought a store in Tupelo\"). The father died from a viral infection and the mother is despondent (\"Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything\"). The narrator likewise remains privately affected: she often visits Choctaw Ridge collecting flowers to \"drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge\".<ref>https://www.songfacts.com/facts/bobbie-gentry/ode-to-billie-joe</ref>\n\n===Composer's view===\nQuestions arose among listeners: what did Billie Joe and his girlfriend throw off the Tallahatchie Bridge, and why did Billie Joe commit suicide? Speculation ran rampant after the song hit the airwaves. Gentry said in a November 1967 interview that it was the question most asked of her by everyone she met. She said that the most named items were flowers, an engagement ring, a draft card, a bottle of [[LSD]] pills, and an aborted baby. Although she knew what the item was, she would not reveal it, saying only \"Suppose it was a wedding ring.\"\n\n<blockquote>\"It's in there for two reasons,\" she said. \"First, it locks up a definite relationship between Billie Joe and the girl telling the story, the girl at the table. Second, the fact that Billie Joe was seen throwing something off the bridge \u2013 no matter what it was \u2013 provides a possible motivation as to why he jumped off the bridge the next day.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=5y95FQUaxGgC&dat=19671119&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=An Actress with a Big Secret|newspaper=Oxnard Press-Courier|date=November 19, 1967|page=42|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen [[Herman Raucher]] met Gentry in preparation for writing a novel and screenplay based on the song, she said that she had no idea why Billie Joe killed himself.<ref name=studer/> Gentry has, however, commented elsewhere on the song, saying that it is about indifference:<ref name=odeto>{{cite web |title=Biography |publisher=[[Yahoo!

The story of Billie Joe has two more interesting underlying themes. First, the illustration of a group of people's reactions to the life and death of Billie Joe, and its subsequent effect on their lives, is made. Second, the obvious gap between the girl and her mother is shown when both women experience a common loss (first Billie Joe, and later, Papa), and yet Mama and the girl are unable to recognize their mutual loss or share their grief.}}\n\nA commentary published in 2017 in a British newspaper made this comment: \"Fifty years on we're no wiser as to why Billie Joe did what he did and in the context of the song and Gentry's intentions, that's just as it should be\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=Ross|title=12 essential songs that defined 1967|date=18 May 2017 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/12-essential-songs-that-defined-1967-the-beatles-the-rolling-stones-jimi-hendrix-the-kinks-a7740636.html |work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge mentioned in this song collapsed in June 1972 after a fire.<ref name=NME/>\nIt crossed the [[Tallahatchie River]] at [[Money, Mississippi|Money]], about ten miles (16&nbsp;km) north of [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], and has since been rebuilt.

The original recording of \"Ode to Billie Joe\", with no other musicians backing Gentry's guitar according to some reports, had eleven verses lasting eight minutes,<ref>https://www.ft.com/content/38c27b36-3234-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153</ref> telling more of Billie Joe's story. The executives realized that this song would work best as a single, so they cut the length by almost half and added background music, strings, two cellos and four violins, according to Gentry.<ref name=\"performingsongwriter.com\"/>\n\nThe only surviving draft of the seven-minute version of \"Ode to Billie Joe\", which consists of two handwritten pages, is located in the archive of the University of Mississippi.<ref>\n[http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe].</ref> Gentry donated the draft to the University's Faulkner room in 1973.<ref>\n[https://spinditty.com/artists-bands/ode-to-billie-joe The Story Behind the Song \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry].</ref><ref>[ https://olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe]</ref>\n\nThe first page has been published and includes these words not in the final recording.<ref>[https://olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/matinee/filmedinms1.htm Original song lyrics written by Bobbie Gentry for Ode to Billy Joe]</ref><blockquote>\n\"People don't see Sally Jane in town anymore ...

No one really knows what went on up at Choctaw Ridge ... The day that Billy Jo McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn addition to the iconic lyrics that made the final cut, the unused lyrics may showcase Bobbie Gentry's mindset and possible answer to the mystery of what was thrown from the bridge; as well as the narrator's relationship to Billie Joe.  The shorter version left more of the story to the listener's imagination, and made the single more suitable for radio airplay.<ref>[http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-bobbie-gentry.php Bobbie Gentry artist biography] at CountryPolitan.com, now offline.

The poster's tagline, which treats the film as being based on a true story and gives a date of death for Billy (June 3, 1953), led many to believe that the song was based on actual events.<ref name=studer>{{cite book |last=Studer |first=Wayne |title=Rock on The Wild Side: gay male images in popular music of the rock era |publisher=Leyland Publications |year=1994 |pages=97\u201398}}</ref> In Raucher's novel and screenplay, Billy Joe kills himself after a drunken homosexual experience, and the object thrown from the bridge is the narrator's ragdoll. The film was released in 1976, directed and produced by [[Max Baer, Jr]], and starring [[Robby Benson]] and [[Glynnis O'Connor]]. Only the first, second, and fifth verses were sung by Bobbie Gentry in the film, omitting the third and fourth verses.\n\nIn the novel, the ragdoll is the central character's confidant and advisor.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Sadie Sink]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations (and six wins), four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], during the early 1981s.

Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\".

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software.

The game uses a [[Pixel art|retro-pixel]] style of art, similar to games for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is loosely based on the ''Stranger Things'' story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16418816/stranger-things-game-iphone-android |title=This Stranger Things mobile game will help prepare you for the Upside Down |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-04-theres-an-official-stranger-things-video-game-and-it-looks-retro-cool |title=There's an official Stranger Things video game and it looks retro cool |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game.

The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their [[quality assurance]], instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.<ref name=\"GameDallasObserver\" /> Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beating-the-stranger-things-game-reveals-this-neve/1100-6453794/ |title=Beating The Stranger Things Game Reveals This Never-Before-Seen Clip From Season 2 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The game was downloaded 3{{nbsp}}million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities.

Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]].

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software.

The game uses a [[Pixel art|retro-pixel]] style of art, similar to games for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is loosely based on the ''Stranger Things'' story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16418816/stranger-things-game-iphone-android |title=This Stranger Things mobile game will help prepare you for the Upside Down |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-04-theres-an-official-stranger-things-video-game-and-it-looks-retro-cool |title=There's an official Stranger Things video game and it looks retro cool |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game. The team decided to make the game in a similar style to ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' because it \"was a perfect match because both [''Stranger Things'' and ''Zelda''] are about exploration, and it's kind of a mysterious fit that fit the mood of the show,\" according to BonusXP president Dave Pottinger. The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their [[quality assurance]], instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.<ref name=\"GameDallasObserver\" /> Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beating-the-stranger-things-game-reveals-this-neve/1100-6453794/ |title=Beating The Stranger Things Game Reveals This Never-Before-Seen Clip From Season 2 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The game was downloaded 3{{nbsp}}million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise.

Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com/muybridge.html |title=Eadweard Muybridge and His Influence on Horse Art |publisher=Your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Muybridge eventually managed to shoot a small and very fuzzy picture of Occident running in 1873. They agreed it lacked quality, but Stanford was enthused to finally have a reliable depiction of a running horse. No copy of the image has yet resurfaced. Muybridge promised to study better solutions.\n\nIn July 1877, Muybridge made a new picture of Occident at full speed, with improved techniques and a much clearer result. To enhance the still fuzzy picture, it was recreated by a retouche artist and published as a cabinet card. The news about this breakthrough in [[snapshot (photography)|instantaneous photography]] was spread enthusiastically, but several critics believed the heavily manipulated image could not be a truthful depiction of the horse. Muybridge allowed reporters to study the original negative, but he and Stanford planned to work on a project that would convince everyone, so they saw no need to proof that this image was authentic. The original negative has not yet resurfaced.\n\nIn June 1878, Muybridge created sequential series of photographs with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford's [[Palo Alto Stock Farm Horse Barn|Palo Alto Stock Farm]] (now the campus of [[Stanford University]]). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a card or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electro-magnetic circuit. For a session 15 June 1878, the press and a selection of turfmen were invited to witness the process. An accident with a snapping strap was captured on the negatives and shown to the attendees, convincing even the most skeptical witnesses. The news of this success was reported worldwide. \n\n''[[The Daily Alta California]]'' reported that Muybridge first exhibited magic lantern slides of the photographs at the [[San Francisco Art Association]] on 8 July 1878.<ref>{{cite news |title=Muybridge's Photographs |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18780709.2.15&srpos=16&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-muybridge-------1 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |volume=XXX|issue=10315 |page=1|publisher=[[Daily Alta California]] |date=9 July 1878}}</ref> Six different series were soon published, as cabinet cards entitled ''[[The Horse in Motion]]''.

Muybridge intervened several times and believed the affair was over when he sent Flora to stay with a relative and Larkyns found a job at a mine near [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]]. Mid-October 1874, Muybridge learned how serious the relationship between his wife and Larkyns really was. Flora's maternity nurse revealed many details and had  in her possession some love letters that the couple still had been writing to each other. At her place, Muybridge also came across a picture of Florado with \"Harry\" written on the back in Flora's handwriting, suggesting that she believed the child to be Larkyns'.\n\nOn 17 October, Muybridge went to Calistoga to track down Larkyns. Upon finding him, Muybridge said, \"Here's the answer to the letter you sent my wife\", and shot him [[point-blank]]. Larkyns died that night, and Muybridge was arrested without protest and put in the [[Napa, California|Napa]] jail.<ref name=\"Haas1976\">{{cite book |last=Haas |first=Robert Bartlett |authorlink= |year=1976 |origyear= |title=Muybridge: Man in Motion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ivSaYmrI0TEC |location=Oakland, CA |publisher=University of California Press |page= |isbn=978-0-52002-464-9 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nA ''Sacramento Daily Union'' reporter visited Muybridge in Jail for an hour and related how he was coping with the situation.

The opening of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, and the development of [[steamship]]s made travel much faster and less arduous than it was in 1860. On 13 March 1882 he lectured at the [[Royal Institution]] in London in front of a sell-out audience, which included members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], notably the future [[King Edward VII]].<ref name=BCLG>Brian Clegg [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780309101127/page/n172 <!-- pg=159 quote=King Edward - eadweard muybridge. --> ''The Man Who Stopped Time: The Illuminating Story of Eadweard Muybridge : Pioneer Photographer, Father of the Motion Picture, Murderer''], Joseph Henry Press, 2007</ref> He displayed his photographs on screen and showed moving pictures projected by his zoopraxiscope.<ref name=BCLG/>\n\nMuybridge and Stanford had a major falling-out concerning his research on equine locomotion.

The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.\n\nIn 1887, the photos were published as a massive portfolio, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.<ref name=\"UPennArchive\">[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072501/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html |date=16 December 2008 }} \"The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study\"</ref> Muybridge's work contributed substantially to developments in the science of [[biomechanics]] and the mechanics of athletics.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed \"[[bullet time]]\" photography.\n\nAfter his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition.

The human eye could not fully break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop. Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com/muybridge.html |title=Eadweard Muybridge and His Influence on Horse Art |publisher=Your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Muybridge eventually managed to shoot a small and very fuzzy picture of Occident running in 1873. They agreed it lacked quality, but Stanford was enthused to finally have a reliable depiction of a running horse. No copy of the image has yet resurfaced. Muybridge promised to study better solutions.\n\nIn July 1877, Muybridge made a new picture of Occident at full speed, with improved techniques and a much clearer result. To enhance the still fuzzy picture, it was recreated by a retouche artist and published as a cabinet card. The news about this breakthrough in [[snapshot (photography)|instantaneous photography]] was spread enthusiastically, but several critics believed the heavily manipulated image could not be a truthful depiction of the horse. Muybridge allowed reporters to study the original negative, but he and Stanford planned to work on a project that would convince everyone, so they saw no need to proof that this image was authentic. The original negative has not yet resurfaced.\n\nIn June 1878, Muybridge created sequential series of photographs with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford's [[Palo Alto Stock Farm Horse Barn|Palo Alto Stock Farm]] (now the campus of [[Stanford University]]). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a card or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electro-magnetic circuit. For a session 15 June 1878, the press and a selection of turfmen were invited to witness the process. An accident with a snapping strap was captured on the negatives and shown to the attendees, convincing even the most skeptical witnesses. The news of this success was reported worldwide. \n\n''[[The Daily Alta California]]'' reported that Muybridge first exhibited magic lantern slides of the photographs at the [[San Francisco Art Association]] on 8 July 1878.<ref>{{cite news |title=Muybridge's Photographs |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18780709.2.15&srpos=16&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-muybridge-------1 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |volume=XXX|issue=10315 |page=1|publisher=[[Daily Alta California]] |date=9 July 1878}}</ref> Six different series were soon published, as cabinet cards entitled ''[[The Horse in Motion]]''.

The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed \"[[bullet time]]\" photography.\n\nAfter his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his [[film|moving pictures]] to a paying public.

He returned to the US once more, in 1896\u20131897, to settle financial affairs and to dispose of property related to his work at the University of Pennsylvania.

It was locally known as the Corporation Buses. Initially, it was called '''Birmingham Corporation Tramways''', and, after the first [[motor bus]] services started in July 1914, it became '''Birmingham Corporation Tramways and Omnibus''' in 1928. Finally, in November 1937, it was renamed \"Birmingham City Transport\", though Birmingham itself had been a City since 1889.  It was incorporated into the [[West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive]] in 1969.\n\n==Introduction==\nBirmingham City Transport was acknowledged as one of the country's finest transport undertakings. An employee of a neighbouring undertaking once said enviously that one could eat off the floor of a Birmingham bus. Birmingham City Transport ceased to exist at midnight 30 September 1969 when it became the largest component of the new West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, which at the same time took over the municipal undertakings of Walsall, West Bromwich and Wolverhampton.\n\nBirmingham also possessed a relatively small fleet of trolleybuses and the design of all except the first series ran parallel to the contemporary motor-buses. Birmingham City Transport seems to have inspired remarkable loyalty amongst its officers and troops - even if they did not feel it at the time, their pride is unmistakable now Birmingham City Transport has gone.

It was locally known as the Corporation Buses. Initially, it was called '''Birmingham Corporation Tramways''', and, after the first [[motor bus]] services started in July 1914, it became '''Birmingham Corporation Tramways and Omnibus''' in 1928. Finally, in November 1937, it was renamed \"Birmingham City Transport\", though Birmingham itself had been a City since 1889.  It was incorporated into the [[West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive]] in 1969.\n\n==Introduction==\nBirmingham City Transport was acknowledged as one of the country's finest transport undertakings. An employee of a neighbouring undertaking once said enviously that one could eat off the floor of a Birmingham bus. Birmingham City Transport ceased to exist at midnight 30 September 1969 when it became the largest component of the new West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, which at the same time took over the municipal undertakings of Walsall, West Bromwich and Wolverhampton.\n\nBirmingham also possessed a relatively small fleet of trolleybuses and the design of all except the first series ran parallel to the contemporary motor-buses. Birmingham City Transport seems to have inspired remarkable loyalty amongst its officers and troops - even if they did not feel it at the time, their pride is unmistakable now Birmingham City Transport has gone. Birmingham City Transport was a conservative operator will well-established principles - too conservative, some would say. In the 1920s, Birmingham led the way with closed top double-deck buses. When Birmingham City Transport did evolve its \"New Look\" bus in 1950, it took the British bus industry by storm.\n\nMany operators saddled themselves and their passengers with unreliable standee single-deckers but Birmingham City Transport exercised caution and then were the first city with one-man double deckers.

The problem is that it doesn't tell us much about Liam Payne\" while particularly talking down on \"Both Ways\". Hunt did, however, note that the album \"can be fun when it does loosen up a little more\", naming \"Familiar\", \"Heart Meet Break\", and \"Bedroom Floor\" as standout tracks.<ref name=\"nmereview\"/> Rawiya Kameir of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' was critical, calling Payne \"another pop star flailing to find his identity amid trend-hopping production and half-baked lyrics\" and that \"listening to LP1, you almost feel sorry for Payne.

Yeung of [[AllMusic]] wrote that Payne \"tackles hip-hop and electronic genres but struggles to distinguish himself from the crop of similar-sounding contemporaries\" and that a majority of the songs \"sound more like a streaming playlist set to shuffle\" while adding that the album is \"front-loaded with mostly forgettable trifles\" and \"saved by this bountiful back-end, which plays like an early prediction of a potential greatest-hits collection\" while advising Payne to \"find a more distinctive vision and a team who can better utilize his strong vocals.\" Yeung also added that the album's best tracks include featured artists, particuraly praising \"For You\" as the album's best track while also complimenting \"Familiar\", \"Get Low\", and \"Stack It Up\".<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Writing for ''[[The Times]]'', Will Hodgkinson called the album \"dull\" but praised Payne's \"strong voice\".<ref name=\"timesreview\"/> A.D.
