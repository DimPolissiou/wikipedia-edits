[[Saint Michael (Roman Catholic)|Archangels Michael]] and [[Archangel Gabriel|Gabriel]] are also depicted.]]\n\nThe [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] has been one of the major subjects of [[Western Art]] for centuries. Numerous pieces of '''Marian art in the Catholic Church''' covering a range of topics have been produced, from masters such as [[Michelangelo]] and [[Botticelli]] to works made by unknown peasant artisans.<ref>Timothy Verdon, 2006, ''Mary in Western Art'' {{ISBN|978-0-9712981-9-4}}</ref>\n\nMarian art forms part of the fabric of Roman Catholic Marian culture through their emotional impact on the veneration of the Blessed Virgin. Images such as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] and the many artistic renditions of it as statues are not simply works of art but are a central elements of the daily lives of the Mexican people.<ref name= Meade /> Both [[Miguel Hidalgo|Hidalgo]] and [[Emiliano Zapata|Zapata]] flew Guadalupan flags and depictions of the Virgin of Guadalupe continue to remain a key unifying element in the Mexican nation.<ref name=Maxwell >''The Virgin of Guadalupe'' by Maxwell E. Johnson 2003 {{ISBN|0-7425-2284-9}} pp. 41\u201343</ref> The study of Mary via the field of [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariology]] is thus inherently intertwined with Marian art.<ref>Caroline Ebertshauser et al. 1998 ''Mary: Art, Culture, and Religion through the Ages'' {{ISBN|978-0-8245-1760-1}}</ref>\n\nThe body of teachings that constitute [[Roman Catholic Mariology]] consist of four basic [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|Marian dogmas]]: [[Perpetual virginity]], [[Mother of God]], [[Immaculate conception]] and [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption into Heaven]], derived from [[Bible|Biblical scripture]], the writings of the [[Church Father]]s, and the traditions of the Church.  Other influences on Marian art have been the [[Feast day]]s of the Church, [[Marian apparition]]s, [[Mariology of the saints|writings of the saints]] and popular devotions such as the [[rosary]], the [[Stations of the Cross]], or total consecration, and also [[Mariology of the popes|papal initiatives]], and [[Marian papal encyclicals and Apostolic Letters]].\n\nEach of these fundamental Mariological beliefs has given rise to Roman Catholic Marian art that has become part of Mariology, by emphasizing Marian veneration, being celebrated in specific Marian feasts, or becoming part of key Roman Catholic Marian churches. This article's focus is primarily on how the artistic component of Roman Catholic Mariology has represented the fundamental [[Marian doctrines of the Catholic Church]], and has thus interacted with them, creating a force that has shaped Catholic Mariology over the centuries.\n\n{{RC-Mariology}}\n\n==Blending of art, theology and spirituality==\n{{see also2|[[Marian devotions]]|[[Silent preaching]]|[[Rosary devotions and spirituality|Rosary devotions]]}}\n[[File:Virgin salus populi romani.jpg|right|thumb|[[Salus Populi Romani]], a popular icon in Rome.]]\n\nArt has been an integral element of the Catholic identity since the very beginning.<ref name=Donovan >''Distinctively Catholic: an exploration of Catholic identity'' by Daniel Donovan 1997 {{ISBN|0-8091-3750-X}} pp. 96\u201398</ref> Medieval Catholicism cherished relics and pilgrimages to visit them were common. Churches and specific works of art were commissioned to honor the saints and the Virgin Mary has always been seen as the most powerful intercessor among all saints\u2014her depictions being the subject of veneration among Catholics worldwide.<ref name=Donovan />\n\n[[Roman Catholic Mariology]] does not simply consist of a set of theological writings, but also relies on the emotional impact of art, music and architecture. [[Roman Catholic Marian music|Marian music]] and [[Roman Catholic Marian churches|Marian shrines]] interact with Marian art as key components of Mariology, e.g. the construction of major Marian churches gives rise to major pieces of art for the decoration of the church.<ref>Janusz Rosikon, 2001, ''The Madonnas of Europe: Pilgrimages to the Great Marian Shrines'' {{ISBN|978-0-89870-849-3}}</ref><ref>Edel 2006, ''Madonna: Sacred Art And Holy Music'' {{ISBN|9783937406404}}</ref><ref>University of Dayton Marian Music https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php</ref><ref>Peter Mullen ''Shrines of Our Lady'' {{ISBN|978-0-312-19503-8}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, [[Gabriele Paleotti]]'s ''Discourse on Sacred and Profane Images'' became known as the \"Catechism of images\" for Catholics, given that it established key concepts for the use of images as a form of religious instruction and indoctrination via [[silent preaching]] (''muta predicatio'').<ref name=Mitchell >''The Mystery of the Rosary: Marian Devotion and the Reinvention of Catholicism'' by Nathan Mitchell 2009 {{ISBN|0-8147-9591-9}} pp. 37\u201342</ref><ref name=Barber >''The road from Eden: studies in Christianity and culture'' by John Barber 2008 {{ISBN|1-933146-34-6}} p. 288</ref> Paleotti's approach was implemented by his powerful contemporary Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] and his focus on \"the transformation of Christian life through vision\" and the \"nonverbal [[rules of language]]\" shaped the Catholic reinterpretations of the Virgin Mary in the 16th and 17th centuries and fostered and promoted Marian devotions such as the Rosary.<ref name=Mitchell /><ref name=Barber />\n\nAn example of the interaction of Marian art, culture and churches is [[Salus Populi Romani]], a key Marian icon in Rome at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], the earliest Marian church in Rome. The practice of crowning the images of Mary started at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome by Pope [[Clement VIII]] in the 17th century.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07664a.htm Catholic encyclopedia]</ref> In 1899 Eugenio Pacelli (later [[Pope Pius XII]]) said his first Holy Mass in front of it at the [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. Fifty years later, he physically crowned this picture as part of the first Marian year in Church history, as he proclaimed the [[Queenship of Mary]]. The image was carried from Santa Maria Maggiore around Rome as part of the celebration of the Marian year and the proclamation of the Queenship of Mary.\n\nAnother example is [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]]. Catholics have, for centuries, prayed before this icon, usually in reproductions, to intercede on their behalf to Christ.<ref>Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} pp. 431\u2013433</ref> Over the centuries, several churches dedicated to Our Mother of Perpetual Help have been constructed. Pope [[John Paul II]] held mass at the [[National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help]] in the Philippines where the devotion is very popular and many Catholic churches hold a Novena and Mass honoring it every Wednesday using a replica of the icon, which is also widely displayed in houses, buses and public transport in the Philippines.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1981/february/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19810217_manila-baclaran_en.html Vatican website: Pope John Paul II in the Philippines]</ref><ref>''Culture and customs of the Philippines'' by Paul A.

This illustrates how a medieval work of art can give rise to feast days, Cathedrals and Marian music.\n\n[[File:Ostrabrama-prayer.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Praying to ''[[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]]'' in [[Lithuania]].]]\nThe use of Marian art by Catholics worldwide accompanies specific forms of [[Marian devotion]] and spirituality. The widespread Catholic use of replicas of the statue of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] emphasizes devotions to the [[Immaculate Conception]] and the [[Rosary]], both reported in the Lourdes messages. To Catholics, the distinctive blue and white Lourdes statues are reminders of the emphasis of Lourdes on [[Rosary devotions and spirituality|Rosary devotions]] and the millions of pilgrimages to the [[Rosary Basilica]] at Lourdes shows how Churches, devotions and art intertwine within Catholic culture. The Rosary remains the prayer of choice among Catholics who visit Lourdes or venerate the Lourdes statues worldwide.<ref>''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 {{ISBN|90-04-12654-6}} p. 339</ref><ref>''Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac'' by Matthew Bunson 2008 {{ISBN|1-59276-441-X}} p. 123</ref><ref>''The Mystery of the Rosary'' by Nathan Mitchell 2009 {{ISBN|0-8147-9591-9}} p. 193</ref><ref>''China's Catholics'' by Richard Madsen 1998 {{ISBN|0-520-21326-2}} pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nHistorically, Marian art has not only impacted the image of Mary among Catholics, but that of Jesus.

In the 12th century [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]] in France used the motif of the ''protective mantle'' of the Virgin Mary which shielded the kneeling abbots and abbesses. In the 13th century [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] was also aware of this motif, which eventually led to the iconography of the [[Virgin of Mercy]] and an increased focused on the concept of Marian protection.<ref>Arthur Calkins, Marian Consecration and Entrustment in Burke, Raymond L.; et al.

Some of the earliest Marian churches in Rome date to the 5th century, such as [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] and Santa Maria Maggiore, and these churches were in turn decorated with significant works of art through the centuries.<ref>''Image and Relic: Mediating the Sacred in Early Medieval Rome'' by Erik Thun 2003 {{ISBN|8882652173}} pages 33-35</ref><ref name=Tim37 /> The interaction of Marian art and church construction thus influenced the development of Marian art.<ref>Michael Rose, 2004, ''In Tiers of Glory: The Organic Development of Catholic Church Architecture through the Ages'' Mesa Folio editions, {{ISBN|0967637120}} pages 9-12</ref>\n\nThe Virgin Mary has since become a major subject of Western Art. Masters such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Giotto]], [[Duccio]] and others produced masterpieces with Marian themes.\n\n==Mother of God==\n[[File:Mary & Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints [[Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers|George]], [[Theodore of Amasea|Theodore]] and angels, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].]]\n\nMary's status as the [[Mother of God]] is clear in the Gospels, and the theological implications of this were defined and confirmed by the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431).  Different aspects of Mary's position as mother have been the subject of a large number of works of Catholic art.\n\nThere was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the Council of Ephesus in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].<ref name=Tim37 >''Mary in Western Art'' by Timothy Verdon 2005 {{ISBN|097129819X}} pages 37-40</ref><ref>''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' 2000 {{ISBN|0877790442}} page 408</ref>\n\nBy the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day.  The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[Session of Christ|exaltation]] above other humans.\n\nAt this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.\n\nThe earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.\n\n===Nativity of Jesus===\n{{main|Nativity of Jesus in art}}\n[[File:Nativity (Throne of Maximianus).jpg|thumb|left|120px|Representation of the Nativity on the Throne of Maximianus in [[Ravenna]]]]\n\nThe [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]] has been a major subject of Christian art since the early 4th century. It has been depicted in many different media, both pictorial and sculptural. Pictorial forms include murals, panel paintings, manuscript illuminations, stained glass windows and oil paintings.\nThe earliest representations of the Nativity itself are very simple, just showing the infant, tightly wrapped, lying near the ground in a trough or wicker basket.\n\nA new form of the image, which from the rare early versions seems to have been formulated in 6th-century Palestine, was to set the essential form of Eastern Orthodox images down to the present day. The setting is now a cave - or rather the specific Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem, already underneath the Church of the Nativity, and well-established as a place of pilgrimage, with the approval of the Church.\n[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|thumb|right|210px|''[[Nativity at Night]]'' ({{circa}} 1490) by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]]]]\n\nWestern artists adopted many of the Byzantine iconographic elements, but preferred the scriptural stable to the cave, though [[Duccio]]'s Byzantine-influenced Maest\u00e0 version tries to have both. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or he looks over to her. Suckling is very unusual, but is sometimes shown.\n\nThe image in later medieval Northern Europe was often influenced by the vision of the Nativity of [[Saint Bridget of Sweden]] (1303\u20131373), a very popular mystic. Shortly before her death, she described a vision of the infant Jesus as lying on the ground, and emitting light himself.\n\nFrom the 15th century onwards, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] increasingly became a more common depiction than the Nativity proper. From the 16th century plain Nativities with just the Holy Family, become a clear minority, although [[Caravaggio]] led a return to a more realistic treatment of the ''Adoration of the Shepherds''.\n\nThe perpetual character of Mary's virginity, namely that she was a virgin all her life and not only at her [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]] of [[Jesus Christ]] at the Annunciation (that she was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to him) is alluded to in some forms of Nativity art: [[Salome (Gospel of James)|Salome]], who according to the story in the 2nd-century ''Nativity of Mary''<ref>[http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html Infancy Gospel of James, chapter 20] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611085726/http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html |date=2008-06-11 }}</ref> received physical proof that Mary remained a virgin even in giving birth to Jesus, is found in many depictions of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Comparative Iconography'' by Helene E. Roberts 1998 {{ISBN|1-57958-009-2}} p. 904</ref>\n\n===Madonna===\n[[File:Fra Filippo Lippi 002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Filippo Lippi]], 1459]]\n{{main|Madonna (art)}}\nThe depiction of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. Important to Italian tradition are Byzantine icons, especially those created in Constantinople (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring medieval civilization whose icons, such as the [[Hodegetria]], participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties. Western depictions remained heavily dependent on Byzantine types until at least the 13th century.  In the late Middle Ages, the [[Cretan school]], under [[Venice|Venetian]] rule, was the source of great numbers of icons exported to the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western iconography when required.\n\n[[File:Sto Dom de Sil-23.JPG|thumb|left|120px|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] enthroned Madonna, [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]]]]\nIn the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]] free-standing statues, typically about half life-size, of the enthroned Madonna and Child were an original Western development, since monumental sculpture was forbidden by Orthodoxy. The [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] of c. 980 is one of the earliest of these, made of gold applied to a wooden core, and still the subject of considerable local veneration, as is the 12th century [[Virgin of Montserrat]] in [[Catalonia]], a more developed treatment.\n\nWith the growth of monumental panel painting in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, this type was frequently painted at the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout Tuscany. While members of the mendicant orders of the Franciscan and Dominican Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and later homes. Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.\n\n====Some key Madonnas====\n[[File:Gardenenclosed.jpg|180px|thumb|right|''[[Our Lady of Sorrows]]'' by [[Miguel Bejarano Moreno|Moreno]], [[Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden|hermitage in Warfhuizen]], the Netherlands.]]\nA number of Madonna paintings and statues have gathered a following as important religious icons and noteworthy works of art in various regions of the world.\n\nSome Madonnas are known by a general name and concept rendered or depicted by various artists. For instance, [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is the patron saint of several countries such as [[Slovakia]] and [[Philippines]]. It is represented as the Virgin Mary wounded by seven swords in her heart, a reference to the prophecy of Simeon at the [[Presentation of Jesus]]. [[Our Lady of Sorrows, Queen of Poland]] located in the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]] (Poland's largest church) is an important icon in Poland. The term ''Our Lady of Sorrows'' is also used in other contexts, without a Madonna, e.g. for [[Our Lady of Kibeho]] apparitions.\n\nSome Madonnas become the subject of widespread devotion, and the Marian shrines dedicated to them attract millions of pilgrims per year. An example is [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] in Brazil, whose shrine is surpassed in size only by [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]], and receives more pilgrims per year than any other [[Roman Catholic Marian church]] in the world.<ref>''Religions of the World'' by J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann 2003 {{ISBN|1576072231}} pages 308-309</ref>\n\n=====Latin America=====\nThere is a rich tradition of building statues of the Madonna in South America, a sampling of which is shown in the galleries section of this article. The South American tradition of Marian art dates back to the 16th century, with the [[Virgin of Copacabana]] gaining fame in 1582.<ref>''Art and architecture of viceregal Latin America, 1521\u20131821'' by Kelly Donahue-Wallace 2008 {{ISBN|0826334598}}</ref> Some noteworthy examples are:\n\n:* [[Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos]] is located in the small town of [[San Juan de los Lagos]] in Mexico.

Dall'Orto 26-5-2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Christ and Mary, mosaic, [[Chora Church]], 16th century]]\n{{main|Life of the Virgin}}\nScenes of Mary and Jesus together fall into two main groups: those with an infant Jesus, and those from the last period of his life.  After the episodes of the Nativity, there are a number of further narrative scenes of Mary and the infant Jesus together which are often depicted: the [[Circumcision of Christ]], [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]], [[Flight into Egypt]], and less specific scenes of Mary and Jesus with his cousin [[John the Baptist]], sometimes with John's mother [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Virgin of the Rocks]] is a famous example.  Gatherings of the whole extended family of Jesus form a subject known as the [[Holy Kinship]], popular in the [[Northern Renaissance]].  Mary appears in the background of the only incident in the [[Gospel]]s from the later childhood of Jesus, the [[Finding in the Temple]].\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Michelangelo]]'s [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|''Piet\u00e0'']], 1498]]\nMary is then usually absent from scenes of the period of Christ's life between his [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]] and his Passion, except for the [[Wedding at Cana]], where she is placed in the Gospels.  A non-scriptural subject of [[Christ taking leave of his Mother]] (before going to [[Jerusalem]] at the start of his Passion) was often painted in 15th- and early 16th-century Germany.  Mary is placed at the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] by the Gospels, and is almost invariably shown, with Saint [[John the Evangelist]], in fully depicted works, as well as often being shown in the background of earlier scenes of the [[Passion of Christ]].  The [[rood]] cross common in medieval Western churches had statues of Mary and John flanking a central [[crucifix]].  Mary is shown as present at the [[Deposition of Christ]] and his Entombment; in the late Middle Ages the [[Piet\u00e0]] emerged in Germany as a separate subject, especially in sculpture.  Mary is also included, though this is not mentioned in any of the scriptural accounts, in depictions of the [[Ascension of Jesus]].  After the Ascension, she is the centrally-placed figure in depictions of [[Pentecost]], which is her latest appearance in the Gospels.\n\nThe main scenes above, showing incidents celebrated as [[feast day]]s by the church, formed part of cycles of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' (though the selection of scenes in these varied considerably), as well as the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]''.\n\n==Perpetual virginity==\n[[File:Annunciation Melozzo da Forli Pantheon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Fresco of the Annunciation at the [[Pantheon, Rome]], 15th century]]\n\nThe [[dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is the earliest of the four Marian dogmas and Catholic [[liturgy]] has repeatedly referred to Mary as \"ever virgin\" for centuries.<ref>Marian Dogmas at University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/mariandogmas.html</ref><ref>[http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/liturgy/liturgy.html Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom], [http://www.coptic.net/prayers/StBasilLiturgy.html Coptic Liturgy of St Basil], [http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/liturgy/liturgy_of_st_cyril.pdf Liturgy of St Cyril], [http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm Liturgy of St James]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615045105/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm |date=15 June 2008 }}, [http://www.frmichel.najim.net/liturgyvid.pdf Understanding the Orthodox Liturgy], etc.</ref> The dogma means that Mary was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to [[Jesus Christ]].

The Annunciation is one of the most frequently depicted scenes in Western art.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Angels |author=[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |year=2004 |isbn= 0-8160-5023-6 |page= 183 |edition=Second}}</ref> Annunciation scenes also amount to the most frequent appearances of Gabriel in medieval art.<ref>''Medieval art: a topical dictionary'' by Leslie Ross 1996 {{ISBN|0-313-29329-5}} p. 99</ref> The depiction of Joseph turning away in some [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity scenes]] is a discreet reference to the fatherhood of the Holy Spirit, and the doctrine of Virgin Birth.<ref>''Christian iconography: a study of its origins'' by Andr\u00e9 Grabar 1968 Taylor & Francis p. 130</ref>\n\n[[Fresco]]s depicting this scene have appeared in [[Roman Catholic Marian churches]] for centuries and it has been a topic addressed by many artists in multiple media, ranging from [[stained glass]] to [[mosaic]], to [[relief]], to [[sculpture]] to oil painting.<ref>Annunciation Art, Phaidon Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7148-4447-0}}</ref> The oldest fresco of the annunciation is a 4th-century depiction in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]] in Rome.<ref>''The Annunciation to Mary'' by Eugene Laverdiere 2007 {{ISBN|1-56854-557-6}} p. 29</ref> In most (but not all) Catholic, and indeed Western, depictions Gabriel is shown on the left, while in the Eastern Church he is more often depicted on the right.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture'' by Peter Murray 1996 {{ISBN|0-19-866165-7}} p. 24</ref>\n[[File:Pietro Cavallini 013.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Annunciation mosaic, [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], Rome, 1291.]]\n\nIt has been one of the most frequent subjects of Christian art particularly during the [[Middle Ages]] and Renaissance. The figures of the Virgin Mary and the Archangel Gabriel, being emblematic of purity and grace, were favorite subjects of many painters such as [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Duccio]] and [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo|Murillo]] among others. In many depictions the angel may be holding a [[Lily flower|lily]], symbolic of Mary's virginity.<ref>''Medieval art: a topical dictionary'' by Leslie Ross 1996 {{ISBN|0-313-29329-5}} p. 16</ref> The mosaics of [[Pietro Cavallini]] in [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome (1291), the [[fresco]]s of [[Giotto]] in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] (1303), [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s fresco at the church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]] (1486) and [[Donatello]]'s gilded sculpture at the church of [[Santa Croce, Florence]] (1435) are famous examples.\n\nThe natural composition of the scene, consisting of two figures facing each other, also made it suitable for decorated arches above doorways.\n\n==Immaculate Conception==\n[[File:Inmaculada Concepcion (La Colosal).jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Murillo]]'s ''Immaculate Conception'', 1650]]\n\nGiven that up to the 13th century a series of saints including [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in general had either opposed or questioned this doctrine, Roman Catholic art on the subject mostly dates to periods after the 15th century and is absent from [[Renaissance]] art. But with support from popular opinion, the [[Franciscans]] and theologians such as [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Duns Scotus]], the popularity of the doctrine increased and a feast-day for it was promoted.\n\n[[File:ImmaculateEmblem.jpg|thumb|right|Swiss emblem, 16th century.]]\n[[Pope Pius V]], the Dominican Pope who in 1570 established the [[Tridentine Mass]], included the feast (but without the adjective \"Immaculate\") in the [[Tridentine Calendar]], but suppressed the existing special Mass for the feast, directing that the Mass for the Nativity of Mary (with the word \"Nativity\" replaced by \"Conception\") be used instead.<ref>[http://civitas-dei.eu/cavendish.htm Paul Cavendish, \"The Tridentine Mass\"]</ref> Part of that earlier Mass was revived in the Mass that [[Pope Pius IX]] ordered to be used on the feast and that is still in use.<ref name=Habig>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/LANDMARY.HTM Marion A. Habig, \"Land of Mary Immaculate\"]</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century there was a widespread intellectual fashion for [[emblem]]s in both religious and secular contexts.  These consisted of a visual representation of the symbol (pictura) and usually a Latin [[motto]]; frequently an explanatory epigram was added. [[Emblem book]]s were very popular.<ref>Emblems for Immaculate Conception {{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211015523/https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |archivedate=2008-12-11 }}</ref>\n\nDrawing on the emblem tradition, [[Francisco Pacheco]] established an iconography that influenced artists such as Murillo, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others. This style of representation of the immaculate Conception then spread to the rest of Europe, and has since remained the usual depiction.\n\nThe [[dogmatic definition]] of Immaculate Conception was performed by [[Pope Pius IX]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'', in 1854. The dogma gained additional significance from the apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858, with the lady in the apparition identifying herself as \"the Immaculate Conception\" and the faithful believing her to be the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n\n===Depiction of the Immaculate Conception===\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Piero di Cosimo]] ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505]]\nFrom an art historical perspective, the depiction of the Immaculate Conception involves a number of interesting issues. Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the [[Immaculate Conception]], and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years.\n\nSince a key Scriptural text pointed to in support of the doctrine was \"[[Tota pulchra es]]...\", \"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee\", verse 4.7 from the [[Song of Solomon]],<ref>[http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html The whole text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529140849/http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html |date=2011-05-29 }}</ref> a number of symbolic objects drawn from the imagery of the ''Song'', and often already associated with the Annunciation and the Perpetual Virginity, were combined in versions of the [[Hortus conclusus]] (\"enclosed garden\") subject. This gave a rather cluttered subject, and usually was impossible to combine with correct perspective, so never caught on outside Germany and the [[Low Countries]]. [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists who tried new solutions, but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\n[[File:10 Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n (National Gallery de Londres, c. 1618).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Immaculate Conception]]'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1618]]\nThe definitive iconography for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] (1564\u20131644), to whom the Inquisition in [[Seville]] also contracted the approval of new images. He described his iconography in his ''Art of Painting'' (''Arte de la Pintura'', published posthumously in 1649):\n\n<blockquote>\"The version that I follow is the one that is closest to the holy revelation of the Evangelist and approved by the Catholic Church on the authority of the sacred and holy interpreters... In this loveliest of mysteries Our Lady should be painted as a beautiful young girl, 12 or 13 years old, in the flower of her youth... And thus she is praised by the Husband: ''tota pulchra es amica mea'', a text that is always written in this painting. She should be painted wearing a white tunic and a blue mantle... She is surrounded by the sun, an oval sun of white and ochre, which sweetly blends into the sky.  Rays of light emanate from her head, around which is a [[Circle of stars|ring of twelve stars]].  An imperial crown adorns her head, without, however, hiding the stars.  Under her feet is the moon. Although it is a solid globe, I take the liberty of making it transparent so that the landscape shows through.\"<ref>''\u00c9sot\u00e9risme, gnoses & imaginaire symbolique: m\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} p. 676</ref><ref>''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R. Katz and Robert A. Orsi 2001 {{ISBN|0-19-514557-7}} p. 98</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSpanish artists such as [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]] (especially), [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others adopted this formula, with variations, and it then spread to the rest of Europe, since when it has remained the usual depiction.\n\nThis particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) [[God]]. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1-2. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[cherubs]]. In some paintings the cherubim are holding [[Lilium candidum|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.\n\n==Assumption of Mary==\n[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Titian]] ''Assumption'', 1516]]\n\nThe Catholic doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of Mary into Heaven]] states that Mary was transported into Heaven with her body and soul united. Although the Assumption was only officially declared a [[Roman Catholic dogma|dogma]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' in 1950, its roots in Catholic culture and art go back many centuries. While Pope [[Pius XII]] deliberately left open the question of whether Mary died before her Assumption, the more common teaching of the early Fathers is that she did.<ref>As the Virgin Mary remained an ever-virgin and sinless, it is viewed that the Virgin Mary could not thus suffer the consequences of [[Original Sin]], which is chiefly Death. http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3819.htm Nicea II Session 6 Decree</ref><ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/NICAEA2.HTM#2 Nicaea II Definition, \"without blemish\"]</ref>\n\nAn early supporter of the Assumption was Saint [[John of Damascus]] (676\u2013794), a [[Doctor of the Church]] who is often called the ''Doctor of the Assumption''.<ref>\nChristopher Rengers, ''The 33 Doctors Of The Church'', Tan Books & Publishers, 200, {{ISBN|0-89555-440-2}}</ref> Saint John was not only interested in the Assumption, but also supported the use of holy images in response to the edict by the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], banning the worship or exhibition of holy images.<ref>Mary H. Allies, ''St. John Damascene on Holy Images, Followed by Three Sermons on the Assumption'' London, 1899.</ref> He wrote: \"On this day the sacred and life-filled ark of the living God, she who conceived her Creator in her womb, rests in the Temple of the Lord that is not made with hands. David, her ancestor, leaps, and with him the angels lead the dance.\"\n\nThe Eastern Church held the feast of the Assumption as early as the second half of the 6th century, and [[Pope Sergius I]] (687\u2013701) ordered its observance in Rome.<ref>University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/maryassump1.html</ref>\n\nThe Orthodox tradition is clear that Mary died normally, before being bodily assumed. The Orthodox term for the death is the [[Dormition of the Virgin]].  Byzantine depictions of this were the basis for Western images, the subject being known as the [[Death of the Virgin]] in the West.  As the nature of the Assumption became controversial during the High Middle Ages, the subject was often avoided, but depiction continued to be common until the Reformation.  The last major Catholic depiction is [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'' of 1606.\n\nMeanwhile, depictions of the Assumption had been becoming more frequent during the late Middle Ages, with the Gothic [[Siena|Siennese]] school a particular source. By the 16th century they had become the norm, initially in Italy, and then elsewhere.  They were sometimes combined with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], as the [[Trinity]] waited in the clouds.  The subject was very suited to Baroque treatment.\n\n==Queen of Heaven==\n{{Main|Queen of Heaven}}\n[[File:SalusPopuliromanicrowned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Salus Populi Romani]] crowned by [[Pope Pius XII]]]]\n\nThe Roman Catholic teaching that Mary is far above all other creatures in dignity, and after [[Jesus Christ]] possesses primacy over all goes back to the early church. Saint [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] said: \"You have surpassed every creature\" and Saint [[Germain of Paris]] (469\u2013576) stated: \"Your honor and dignity surpass the whole of creation; your greatness places you above the angels.\" Saint [[John of Damascus]] went further: \"Limitless is the difference between God's servants and His Mother.\"<ref>Dictionary of Mary, Catholic Book Publishing Co., New York, 1985</ref><ref>[[Ad Caeli Reginam]] 40</ref>\n\n[[File:PiusXIISaluspopuli.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Coronation of the icon by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1954]]\nThe feast of the [[Queenship of Mary]] was only formally established in 1954 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[encyclical]] [[Ad Caeli Reginam]]. Pius XII also declare the first Marian year and a number of [[Roman Catholic Church]] rededications took place, e.g. the 1955 rededication of the church of ''Saint James the Great'' in [[Montreal]] with the new title [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]] a title proclaimed by Pius XII.\n\nYet, long before 1954 the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] had been the subject of a good number of artistic works. Some of these paintings built on the third phase of the Assumption of Mary in which following her Assumption, she is crowned as the ''[[Queen of Heaven]]''.\n\n== Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times ==\n[[File:Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times (by Vito Petrus).jpg|thumb]]\nThis icon has two Gospel passages written on it. The first one is, Mark 14:72.\n\nImmediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.\n\nThe second one is, John 21:15-19.\n\nWhen they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of Jonas, do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my lambs. \u201cA second time he said to him, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cTend my sheep. \u201cHe said to him the third time, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time \u201cDo you love me?\u201d And he said to him, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.\u201d He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God. After this he said to him, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nAs we know by tradition, the apostle Peter was in charge of the rest of the eleven apostles since the beginning even before when Jesus told him, \u201cAnd I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.\u201d Matthew 16:18.\n\nThis means that from the time when Peter denied Jesus and the rooster crowed on Holy Thursday, till the time when Jesus appeared to his disciples for the third time after he was raised from the dead and asked him three times if he loves Him, no one was in charge of the church characterized by the faithful and the apostles, but instead of Peter, Mary the Mother of Jesus was in charge of it, and that is why this icon depicts her with two keys in her hands given to her by Jesus Himself depicted as a child to show that this was already planned by God the Father beforehand.\n\nThe other title Our Lady of the end of Times, is given to her because due to the confusion in the church that we are experiencing today, she is not just in charge of the church instead of the successor of Peter as she was before after Peter\u2019s denial of Jesus, but she has this double title due to the end of times as prophesied by many mystics and in the Bible itself.\n\n==Apparitions==\n[[File:Virgen de F\u00e1tima.JPG|thumb|200px|The statue of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] includes several Catholic elements, such as being apparition-based, being a crowned statue and holding a [[Rosary]]. One of the bullets that wounded [[Pope John Paul II]] in [[St. Peter's Square]] in 1981 was placed in the crown of the statue.<ref name=Guiley >{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Saints |author= [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |year=2001 |isbn= 0-8160-4134-2 |page=162 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]}}</ref>]]\n\nRoman Catholic devotion to Mary has at times been driven by [[Marian apparition|religious experiences and visions]] of simple and modest individuals (in many cases children) on remote hilltops which in time have created strong emotions among large numbers of Roman Catholics. Examples include Saint [[Juan Diego]] in 1531 as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous]] as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858 and [[Lucia dos Santos]], [[Jacinta Marto]] and [[Francisco Marto]] as [[Our Lady of Fatima]] in 1917.<ref>Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}</ref>\n\nAlthough every year over five million pilgrims visit Lourdes and Guadalupe each, the volume of Roman Catholic art to accompany this enthusiasm has been essentially restricted to popular images. Hence although apparitions have resulted in the construction of very large Marian churches at [[Lourdes]] and [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]] they have not so far had a similar impact on Marian art. Yet images such as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] and the artistic renditions of it as statues are not simply works of art but are a central elements of the daily lives of the Mexican people.<ref name= Meade >''A History of Modern Latin America'' by Teresa A.

From the very beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation]] its leaders expressed their discomfort with the depictions of saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition of art developed, the depictions of the Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and view it as a Catholic excess.<ref name=Hillerbrand >''The encyclopedia of Protestantism'' edited by Hans Joachim Hillerbrand 2003 {{ISBN|0-415-92472-3}} pp. 171\u2013173</ref><ref>''Mary in Western art'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} p. 61</ref><ref>''Christian art'' by Beth Williamson 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-280328-X}} pp. 102\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgen del Carmen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The use of Marian [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Brown Scapular]] is a distinguishing feature of Catholic art.]]\nUnlike the majority of the Protestants, the Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Marian images, but in a different manner and with a different emphasis from the Catholic tradition. While statues of the Virgin Mary abound in Catholic churches, there are specific prohibitions against all three-dimensional representations (of Mary or any other any saints) within the Orthodox Church, for they are regarded as remnants of pagan idolatry. Hence the Orthodox only produce and venerate two-dimensional images.<ref name=Benz >''The Eastern Orthodox Church: Its Thought and Life'' by Ernst Benz 2009 {{ISBN|0-202-36298-1}} pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=Mylonas >''Serbian orthodox fundamentals'' by Christos Mylonas 2003 {{ISBN|963-9241-61-X}} pp. 45\u201348</ref><ref name=Flinn >Encyclopedia of Catholicism'' by Frank K.

In fact, there is a three way, carefully coordinated interplay of prayers, icons and [[hymns to Mary]] within Orthodox liturgy, at times with specific feasts that relate to the Theotokos icons and the [[Hymns to Mary|Akathists]].<ref name=Benz /><ref name=Dragas /><ref>''America's religions: from their origins to the twenty-first century'' by Peter W.

The rich background representation of flowers or gardens found in Catholic art are not present in Orthodox depictions whose primary focus is the Theotokos, often with the [[Child Jesus]].<ref name=McPherson >''Keeping silence: Christian practices for entering stillness'' by C.

Alles 2007 {{ISBN|0-8160-6141-6}} pp. 33\u201334</ref> Apparition-based images such as the statues of the [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] accentuate the differences in that they are based on apparitions that are purely Catholic, as well as being three-dimensional representations. And the presence of [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Rosary]] and the [[Brown Scapular]] on the statues of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] emphasize a totally Catholic form of Marian art.\n\nApart from stylistic issues, significant doctrinal differences separate Catholic Marian art from other Christian approaches.

Other influences on Marian art have been the [[Feast day]]s of the Church, [[Marian apparition]]s, [[Mariology of the saints|writings of the saints]] and popular devotions such as the [[rosary]], the [[Stations of the Cross]], or total consecration, and also [[Mariology of the popes|papal initiatives]], and [[Marian papal encyclicals and Apostolic Letters]].\n\nEach of these fundamental Mariological beliefs has given rise to Roman Catholic Marian art that has become part of Mariology, by emphasizing Marian veneration, being celebrated in specific Marian feasts, or becoming part of key Roman Catholic Marian churches. This article's focus is primarily on how the artistic component of Roman Catholic Mariology has represented the fundamental [[Marian doctrines of the Catholic Church]], and has thus interacted with them, creating a force that has shaped Catholic Mariology over the centuries.\n\n{{RC-Mariology}}\n\n==Blending of art, theology and spirituality==\n{{see also2|[[Marian devotions]]|[[Silent preaching]]|[[Rosary devotions and spirituality|Rosary devotions]]}}\n[[File:Virgin salus populi romani.jpg|right|thumb|[[Salus Populi Romani]], a popular icon in Rome.]]\n\nArt has been an integral element of the Catholic identity since the very beginning.<ref name=Donovan >''Distinctively Catholic: an exploration of Catholic identity'' by Daniel Donovan 1997 {{ISBN|0-8091-3750-X}} pp. 96\u201398</ref> Medieval Catholicism cherished relics and pilgrimages to visit them were common.

[[Roman Catholic Marian music|Marian music]] and [[Roman Catholic Marian churches|Marian shrines]] interact with Marian art as key components of Mariology, e.g. the construction of major Marian churches gives rise to major pieces of art for the decoration of the church.<ref>Janusz Rosikon, 2001, ''The Madonnas of Europe: Pilgrimages to the Great Marian Shrines'' {{ISBN|978-0-89870-849-3}}</ref><ref>Edel 2006, ''Madonna: Sacred Art And Holy Music'' {{ISBN|9783937406404}}</ref><ref>University of Dayton Marian Music https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php</ref><ref>Peter Mullen ''Shrines of Our Lady'' {{ISBN|978-0-312-19503-8}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, [[Gabriele Paleotti]]'s ''Discourse on Sacred and Profane Images'' became known as the \"Catechism of images\" for Catholics, given that it established key concepts for the use of images as a form of religious instruction and indoctrination via [[silent preaching]] (''muta predicatio'').<ref name=Mitchell >''The Mystery of the Rosary: Marian Devotion and the Reinvention of Catholicism'' by Nathan Mitchell 2009 {{ISBN|0-8147-9591-9}} pp. 37\u201342</ref><ref name=Barber >''The road from Eden: studies in Christianity and culture'' by John Barber 2008 {{ISBN|1-933146-34-6}} p. 288</ref> Paleotti's approach was implemented by his powerful contemporary Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] and his focus on \"the transformation of Christian life through vision\" and the \"nonverbal [[rules of language]]\" shaped the Catholic reinterpretations of the Virgin Mary in the 16th and 17th centuries and fostered and promoted Marian devotions such as the Rosary.<ref name=Mitchell /><ref name=Barber />\n\nAn example of the interaction of Marian art, culture and churches is [[Salus Populi Romani]], a key Marian icon in Rome at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], the earliest Marian church in Rome. The practice of crowning the images of Mary started at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome by Pope [[Clement VIII]] in the 17th century.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07664a.htm Catholic encyclopedia]</ref> In 1899 Eugenio Pacelli (later [[Pope Pius XII]]) said his first Holy Mass in front of it at the [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. Fifty years later, he physically crowned this picture as part of the first Marian year in Church history, as he proclaimed the [[Queenship of Mary]]. The image was carried from Santa Maria Maggiore around Rome as part of the celebration of the Marian year and the proclamation of the Queenship of Mary.\n\nAnother example is [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]].

The widespread Catholic use of replicas of the statue of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] emphasizes devotions to the [[Immaculate Conception]] and the [[Rosary]], both reported in the Lourdes messages. To Catholics, the distinctive blue and white Lourdes statues are reminders of the emphasis of Lourdes on [[Rosary devotions and spirituality|Rosary devotions]] and the millions of pilgrimages to the [[Rosary Basilica]] at Lourdes shows how Churches, devotions and art intertwine within Catholic culture. The Rosary remains the prayer of choice among Catholics who visit Lourdes or venerate the Lourdes statues worldwide.<ref>''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 {{ISBN|90-04-12654-6}} p. 339</ref><ref>''Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac'' by Matthew Bunson 2008 {{ISBN|1-59276-441-X}} p. 123</ref><ref>''The Mystery of the Rosary'' by Nathan Mitchell 2009 {{ISBN|0-8147-9591-9}} p. 193</ref><ref>''China's Catholics'' by Richard Madsen 1998 {{ISBN|0-520-21326-2}} pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nHistorically, Marian art has not only impacted the image of Mary among Catholics, but that of Jesus.

In the 12th century [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]] in France used the motif of the ''protective mantle'' of the Virgin Mary which shielded the kneeling abbots and abbesses. In the 13th century [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] was also aware of this motif, which eventually led to the iconography of the [[Virgin of Mercy]] and an increased focused on the concept of Marian protection.<ref>Arthur Calkins, Marian Consecration and Entrustment in Burke, Raymond L.; et al.

Some of the earliest Marian churches in Rome date to the 5th century, such as [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] and Santa Maria Maggiore, and these churches were in turn decorated with significant works of art through the centuries.<ref>''Image and Relic: Mediating the Sacred in Early Medieval Rome'' by Erik Thun 2003 {{ISBN|8882652173}} pages 33-35</ref><ref name=Tim37 /> The interaction of Marian art and church construction thus influenced the development of Marian art.<ref>Michael Rose, 2004, ''In Tiers of Glory: The Organic Development of Catholic Church Architecture through the Ages'' Mesa Folio editions, {{ISBN|0967637120}} pages 9-12</ref>\n\nThe Virgin Mary has since become a major subject of Western Art. Masters such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Giotto]], [[Duccio]] and others produced masterpieces with Marian themes.\n\n==Mother of God==\n[[File:Mary & Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints [[Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers|George]], [[Theodore of Amasea|Theodore]] and angels, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].]]\n\nMary's status as the [[Mother of God]] is clear in the Gospels, and the theological implications of this were defined and confirmed by the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431).  Different aspects of Mary's position as mother have been the subject of a large number of works of Catholic art.\n\nThere was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the Council of Ephesus in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].<ref name=Tim37 >''Mary in Western Art'' by Timothy Verdon 2005 {{ISBN|097129819X}} pages 37-40</ref><ref>''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' 2000 {{ISBN|0877790442}} page 408</ref>\n\nBy the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day.  The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[Session of Christ|exaltation]] above other humans.\n\nAt this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.\n\nThe earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.\n\n===Nativity of Jesus===\n{{main|Nativity of Jesus in art}}\n[[File:Nativity (Throne of Maximianus).jpg|thumb|left|120px|Representation of the Nativity on the Throne of Maximianus in [[Ravenna]]]]\n\nThe [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]] has been a major subject of Christian art since the early 4th century. It has been depicted in many different media, both pictorial and sculptural. Pictorial forms include murals, panel paintings, manuscript illuminations, stained glass windows and oil paintings.\nThe earliest representations of the Nativity itself are very simple, just showing the infant, tightly wrapped, lying near the ground in a trough or wicker basket.\n\nA new form of the image, which from the rare early versions seems to have been formulated in 6th-century Palestine, was to set the essential form of Eastern Orthodox images down to the present day. The setting is now a cave - or rather the specific Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem, already underneath the Church of the Nativity, and well-established as a place of pilgrimage, with the approval of the Church.\n[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|thumb|right|210px|''[[Nativity at Night]]'' ({{circa}} 1490) by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]]]]\n\nWestern artists adopted many of the Byzantine iconographic elements, but preferred the scriptural stable to the cave, though [[Duccio]]'s Byzantine-influenced Maest\u00e0 version tries to have both. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or he looks over to her. Suckling is very unusual, but is sometimes shown.\n\nThe image in later medieval Northern Europe was often influenced by the vision of the Nativity of [[Saint Bridget of Sweden]] (1303\u20131373), a very popular mystic. Shortly before her death, she described a vision of the infant Jesus as lying on the ground, and emitting light himself.\n\nFrom the 15th century onwards, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] increasingly became a more common depiction than the Nativity proper. From the 16th century plain Nativities with just the Holy Family, become a clear minority, although [[Caravaggio]] led a return to a more realistic treatment of the ''Adoration of the Shepherds''.\n\nThe perpetual character of Mary's virginity, namely that she was a virgin all her life and not only at her [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]] of [[Jesus Christ]] at the Annunciation (that she was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to him) is alluded to in some forms of Nativity art: [[Salome (Gospel of James)|Salome]], who according to the story in the 2nd-century ''Nativity of Mary''<ref>[http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html Infancy Gospel of James, chapter 20] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611085726/http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html |date=2008-06-11 }}</ref> received physical proof that Mary remained a virgin even in giving birth to Jesus, is found in many depictions of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Comparative Iconography'' by Helene E. Roberts 1998 {{ISBN|1-57958-009-2}} p. 904</ref>\n\n===Madonna===\n[[File:Fra Filippo Lippi 002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Filippo Lippi]], 1459]]\n{{main|Madonna (art)}}\nThe depiction of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. Important to Italian tradition are Byzantine icons, especially those created in Constantinople (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring medieval civilization whose icons, such as the [[Hodegetria]], participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties. Western depictions remained heavily dependent on Byzantine types until at least the 13th century.  In the late Middle Ages, the [[Cretan school]], under [[Venice|Venetian]] rule, was the source of great numbers of icons exported to the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western iconography when required.\n\n[[File:Sto Dom de Sil-23.JPG|thumb|left|120px|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] enthroned Madonna, [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]]]]\nIn the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]] free-standing statues, typically about half life-size, of the enthroned Madonna and Child were an original Western development, since monumental sculpture was forbidden by Orthodoxy. The [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] of c. 980 is one of the earliest of these, made of gold applied to a wooden core, and still the subject of considerable local veneration, as is the 12th century [[Virgin of Montserrat]] in [[Catalonia]], a more developed treatment.\n\nWith the growth of monumental panel painting in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, this type was frequently painted at the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout Tuscany. While members of the mendicant orders of the Franciscan and Dominican Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and later homes. Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.\n\n====Some key Madonnas====\n[[File:Gardenenclosed.jpg|180px|thumb|right|''[[Our Lady of Sorrows]]'' by [[Miguel Bejarano Moreno|Moreno]], [[Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden|hermitage in Warfhuizen]], the Netherlands.]]\nA number of Madonna paintings and statues have gathered a following as important religious icons and noteworthy works of art in various regions of the world.\n\nSome Madonnas are known by a general name and concept rendered or depicted by various artists. For instance, [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is the patron saint of several countries such as [[Slovakia]] and [[Philippines]]. It is represented as the Virgin Mary wounded by seven swords in her heart, a reference to the prophecy of Simeon at the [[Presentation of Jesus]]. [[Our Lady of Sorrows, Queen of Poland]] located in the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]] (Poland's largest church) is an important icon in Poland. The term ''Our Lady of Sorrows'' is also used in other contexts, without a Madonna, e.g. for [[Our Lady of Kibeho]] apparitions.\n\nSome Madonnas become the subject of widespread devotion, and the Marian shrines dedicated to them attract millions of pilgrims per year. An example is [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] in Brazil, whose shrine is surpassed in size only by [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]], and receives more pilgrims per year than any other [[Roman Catholic Marian church]] in the world.<ref>''Religions of the World'' by J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann 2003 {{ISBN|1576072231}} pages 308-309</ref>\n\n=====Latin America=====\nThere is a rich tradition of building statues of the Madonna in South America, a sampling of which is shown in the galleries section of this article.

Dall'Orto 26-5-2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Christ and Mary, mosaic, [[Chora Church]], 16th century]]\n{{main|Life of the Virgin}}\nScenes of Mary and Jesus together fall into two main groups: those with an infant Jesus, and those from the last period of his life.  After the episodes of the Nativity, there are a number of further narrative scenes of Mary and the infant Jesus together which are often depicted: the [[Circumcision of Christ]], [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]], [[Flight into Egypt]], and less specific scenes of Mary and Jesus with his cousin [[John the Baptist]], sometimes with John's mother [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Virgin of the Rocks]] is a famous example.  Gatherings of the whole extended family of Jesus form a subject known as the [[Holy Kinship]], popular in the [[Northern Renaissance]].  Mary appears in the background of the only incident in the [[Gospel]]s from the later childhood of Jesus, the [[Finding in the Temple]].\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Michelangelo]]'s [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|''Piet\u00e0'']], 1498]]\nMary is then usually absent from scenes of the period of Christ's life between his [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]] and his Passion, except for the [[Wedding at Cana]], where she is placed in the Gospels.  A non-scriptural subject of [[Christ taking leave of his Mother]] (before going to [[Jerusalem]] at the start of his Passion) was often painted in 15th- and early 16th-century Germany.  Mary is placed at the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] by the Gospels, and is almost invariably shown, with Saint [[John the Evangelist]], in fully depicted works, as well as often being shown in the background of earlier scenes of the [[Passion of Christ]].  The [[rood]] cross common in medieval Western churches had statues of Mary and John flanking a central [[crucifix]].  Mary is shown as present at the [[Deposition of Christ]] and his Entombment; in the late Middle Ages the [[Piet\u00e0]] emerged in Germany as a separate subject, especially in sculpture.  Mary is also included, though this is not mentioned in any of the scriptural accounts, in depictions of the [[Ascension of Jesus]].  After the Ascension, she is the centrally-placed figure in depictions of [[Pentecost]], which is her latest appearance in the Gospels.\n\nThe main scenes above, showing incidents celebrated as [[feast day]]s by the church, formed part of cycles of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' (though the selection of scenes in these varied considerably), as well as the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]''.\n\n==Perpetual virginity==\n[[File:Annunciation Melozzo da Forli Pantheon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Fresco of the Annunciation at the [[Pantheon, Rome]], 15th century]]\n\nThe [[dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is the earliest of the four Marian dogmas and Catholic [[liturgy]] has repeatedly referred to Mary as \"ever virgin\" for centuries.<ref>Marian Dogmas at University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/mariandogmas.html</ref><ref>[http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/liturgy/liturgy.html Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom], [http://www.coptic.net/prayers/StBasilLiturgy.html Coptic Liturgy of St Basil], [http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/liturgy/liturgy_of_st_cyril.pdf Liturgy of St Cyril], [http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm Liturgy of St James]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615045105/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm |date=15 June 2008 }}, [http://www.frmichel.najim.net/liturgyvid.pdf Understanding the Orthodox Liturgy], etc.</ref> The dogma means that Mary was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to [[Jesus Christ]].

But with support from popular opinion, the [[Franciscans]] and theologians such as [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Duns Scotus]], the popularity of the doctrine increased and a feast-day for it was promoted.\n\n[[File:ImmaculateEmblem.jpg|thumb|right|Swiss emblem, 16th century.]]\n[[Pope Pius V]], the Dominican Pope who in 1570 established the [[Tridentine Mass]], included the feast (but without the adjective \"Immaculate\") in the [[Tridentine Calendar]], but suppressed the existing special Mass for the feast, directing that the Mass for the Nativity of Mary (with the word \"Nativity\" replaced by \"Conception\") be used instead.<ref>[http://civitas-dei.eu/cavendish.htm Paul Cavendish, \"The Tridentine Mass\"]</ref> Part of that earlier Mass was revived in the Mass that [[Pope Pius IX]] ordered to be used on the feast and that is still in use.<ref name=Habig>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/LANDMARY.HTM Marion A. Habig, \"Land of Mary Immaculate\"]</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century there was a widespread intellectual fashion for [[emblem]]s in both religious and secular contexts.  These consisted of a visual representation of the symbol (pictura) and usually a Latin [[motto]]; frequently an explanatory epigram was added. [[Emblem book]]s were very popular.<ref>Emblems for Immaculate Conception {{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211015523/https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |archivedate=2008-12-11 }}</ref>\n\nDrawing on the emblem tradition, [[Francisco Pacheco]] established an iconography that influenced artists such as Murillo, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others. This style of representation of the immaculate Conception then spread to the rest of Europe, and has since remained the usual depiction.\n\nThe [[dogmatic definition]] of Immaculate Conception was performed by [[Pope Pius IX]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'', in 1854. The dogma gained additional significance from the apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858, with the lady in the apparition identifying herself as \"the Immaculate Conception\" and the faithful believing her to be the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n\n===Depiction of the Immaculate Conception===\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Piero di Cosimo]] ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505]]\nFrom an art historical perspective, the depiction of the Immaculate Conception involves a number of interesting issues. Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the [[Immaculate Conception]], and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years.\n\nSince a key Scriptural text pointed to in support of the doctrine was \"[[Tota pulchra es]]...\", \"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee\", verse 4.7 from the [[Song of Solomon]],<ref>[http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html The whole text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529140849/http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html |date=2011-05-29 }}</ref> a number of symbolic objects drawn from the imagery of the ''Song'', and often already associated with the Annunciation and the Perpetual Virginity, were combined in versions of the [[Hortus conclusus]] (\"enclosed garden\") subject. This gave a rather cluttered subject, and usually was impossible to combine with correct perspective, so never caught on outside Germany and the [[Low Countries]]. [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists who tried new solutions, but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\n[[File:10 Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n (National Gallery de Londres, c. 1618).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Immaculate Conception]]'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1618]]\nThe definitive iconography for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] (1564\u20131644), to whom the Inquisition in [[Seville]] also contracted the approval of new images. He described his iconography in his ''Art of Painting'' (''Arte de la Pintura'', published posthumously in 1649):\n\n<blockquote>\"The version that I follow is the one that is closest to the holy revelation of the Evangelist and approved by the Catholic Church on the authority of the sacred and holy interpreters... In this loveliest of mysteries Our Lady should be painted as a beautiful young girl, 12 or 13 years old, in the flower of her youth... And thus she is praised by the Husband: ''tota pulchra es amica mea'', a text that is always written in this painting. She should be painted wearing a white tunic and a blue mantle... She is surrounded by the sun, an oval sun of white and ochre, which sweetly blends into the sky.  Rays of light emanate from her head, around which is a [[Circle of stars|ring of twelve stars]].  An imperial crown adorns her head, without, however, hiding the stars.  Under her feet is the moon. Although it is a solid globe, I take the liberty of making it transparent so that the landscape shows through.\"<ref>''\u00c9sot\u00e9risme, gnoses & imaginaire symbolique: m\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} p. 676</ref><ref>''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R. Katz and Robert A. Orsi 2001 {{ISBN|0-19-514557-7}} p. 98</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSpanish artists such as [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]] (especially), [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others adopted this formula, with variations, and it then spread to the rest of Europe, since when it has remained the usual depiction.\n\nThis particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) [[God]]. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1-2. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[cherubs]]. In some paintings the cherubim are holding [[Lilium candidum|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.\n\n==Assumption of Mary==\n[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Titian]] ''Assumption'', 1516]]\n\nThe Catholic doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of Mary into Heaven]] states that Mary was transported into Heaven with her body and soul united. Although the Assumption was only officially declared a [[Roman Catholic dogma|dogma]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' in 1950, its roots in Catholic culture and art go back many centuries. While Pope [[Pius XII]] deliberately left open the question of whether Mary died before her Assumption, the more common teaching of the early Fathers is that she did.<ref>As the Virgin Mary remained an ever-virgin and sinless, it is viewed that the Virgin Mary could not thus suffer the consequences of [[Original Sin]], which is chiefly Death. http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3819.htm Nicea II Session 6 Decree</ref><ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/NICAEA2.HTM#2 Nicaea II Definition, \"without blemish\"]</ref>\n\nAn early supporter of the Assumption was Saint [[John of Damascus]] (676\u2013794), a [[Doctor of the Church]] who is often called the ''Doctor of the Assumption''.<ref>\nChristopher Rengers, ''The 33 Doctors Of The Church'', Tan Books & Publishers, 200, {{ISBN|0-89555-440-2}}</ref> Saint John was not only interested in the Assumption, but also supported the use of holy images in response to the edict by the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], banning the worship or exhibition of holy images.<ref>Mary H. Allies, ''St. John Damascene on Holy Images, Followed by Three Sermons on the Assumption'' London, 1899.</ref> He wrote: \"On this day the sacred and life-filled ark of the living God, she who conceived her Creator in her womb, rests in the Temple of the Lord that is not made with hands. David, her ancestor, leaps, and with him the angels lead the dance.\"\n\nThe Eastern Church held the feast of the Assumption as early as the second half of the 6th century, and [[Pope Sergius I]] (687\u2013701) ordered its observance in Rome.<ref>University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/maryassump1.html</ref>\n\nThe Orthodox tradition is clear that Mary died normally, before being bodily assumed. The Orthodox term for the death is the [[Dormition of the Virgin]].  Byzantine depictions of this were the basis for Western images, the subject being known as the [[Death of the Virgin]] in the West.  As the nature of the Assumption became controversial during the High Middle Ages, the subject was often avoided, but depiction continued to be common until the Reformation.  The last major Catholic depiction is [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'' of 1606.\n\nMeanwhile, depictions of the Assumption had been becoming more frequent during the late Middle Ages, with the Gothic [[Siena|Siennese]] school a particular source. By the 16th century they had become the norm, initially in Italy, and then elsewhere.  They were sometimes combined with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], as the [[Trinity]] waited in the clouds.  The subject was very suited to Baroque treatment.\n\n==Queen of Heaven==\n{{Main|Queen of Heaven}}\n[[File:SalusPopuliromanicrowned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Salus Populi Romani]] crowned by [[Pope Pius XII]]]]\n\nThe Roman Catholic teaching that Mary is far above all other creatures in dignity, and after [[Jesus Christ]] possesses primacy over all goes back to the early church. Saint [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] said: \"You have surpassed every creature\" and Saint [[Germain of Paris]] (469\u2013576) stated: \"Your honor and dignity surpass the whole of creation; your greatness places you above the angels.\" Saint [[John of Damascus]] went further: \"Limitless is the difference between God's servants and His Mother.\"<ref>Dictionary of Mary, Catholic Book Publishing Co., New York, 1985</ref><ref>[[Ad Caeli Reginam]] 40</ref>\n\n[[File:PiusXIISaluspopuli.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Coronation of the icon by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1954]]\nThe feast of the [[Queenship of Mary]] was only formally established in 1954 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[encyclical]] [[Ad Caeli Reginam]]. Pius XII also declare the first Marian year and a number of [[Roman Catholic Church]] rededications took place, e.g. the 1955 rededication of the church of ''Saint James the Great'' in [[Montreal]] with the new title [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]] a title proclaimed by Pius XII.\n\nYet, long before 1954 the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] had been the subject of a good number of artistic works. Some of these paintings built on the third phase of the Assumption of Mary in which following her Assumption, she is crowned as the ''[[Queen of Heaven]]''.\n\n== Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times ==\n[[File:Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times (by Vito Petrus).jpg|thumb]]\nThis icon has two Gospel passages written on it. The first one is, Mark 14:72.\n\nImmediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.\n\nThe second one is, John 21:15-19.\n\nWhen they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of Jonas, do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my lambs. \u201cA second time he said to him, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cTend my sheep. \u201cHe said to him the third time, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time \u201cDo you love me?\u201d And he said to him, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.\u201d He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God. After this he said to him, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nAs we know by tradition, the apostle Peter was in charge of the rest of the eleven apostles since the beginning even before when Jesus told him, \u201cAnd I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.\u201d Matthew 16:18.\n\nThis means that from the time when Peter denied Jesus and the rooster crowed on Holy Thursday, till the time when Jesus appeared to his disciples for the third time after he was raised from the dead and asked him three times if he loves Him, no one was in charge of the church characterized by the faithful and the apostles, but instead of Peter, Mary the Mother of Jesus was in charge of it, and that is why this icon depicts her with two keys in her hands given to her by Jesus Himself depicted as a child to show that this was already planned by God the Father beforehand.\n\nThe other title Our Lady of the end of Times, is given to her because due to the confusion in the church that we are experiencing today, she is not just in charge of the church instead of the successor of Peter as she was before after Peter\u2019s denial of Jesus, but she has this double title due to the end of times as prophesied by many mystics and in the Bible itself.\n\n==Apparitions==\n[[File:Virgen de F\u00e1tima.JPG|thumb|200px|The statue of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] includes several Catholic elements, such as being apparition-based, being a crowned statue and holding a [[Rosary]]. One of the bullets that wounded [[Pope John Paul II]] in [[St. Peter's Square]] in 1981 was placed in the crown of the statue.<ref name=Guiley >{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Saints |author= [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |year=2001 |isbn= 0-8160-4134-2 |page=162 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]}}</ref>]]\n\nRoman Catholic devotion to Mary has at times been driven by [[Marian apparition|religious experiences and visions]] of simple and modest individuals (in many cases children) on remote hilltops which in time have created strong emotions among large numbers of Roman Catholics. Examples include Saint [[Juan Diego]] in 1531 as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous]] as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858 and [[Lucia dos Santos]], [[Jacinta Marto]] and [[Francisco Marto]] as [[Our Lady of Fatima]] in 1917.<ref>Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}</ref>\n\nAlthough every year over five million pilgrims visit Lourdes and Guadalupe each, the volume of Roman Catholic art to accompany this enthusiasm has been essentially restricted to popular images. Hence although apparitions have resulted in the construction of very large Marian churches at [[Lourdes]] and [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]] they have not so far had a similar impact on Marian art. Yet images such as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] and the artistic renditions of it as statues are not simply works of art but are a central elements of the daily lives of the Mexican people.<ref name= Meade >''A History of Modern Latin America'' by Teresa A.

From the very beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation]] its leaders expressed their discomfort with the depictions of saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition of art developed, the depictions of the Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and view it as a Catholic excess.<ref name=Hillerbrand >''The encyclopedia of Protestantism'' edited by Hans Joachim Hillerbrand 2003 {{ISBN|0-415-92472-3}} pp. 171\u2013173</ref><ref>''Mary in Western art'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} p. 61</ref><ref>''Christian art'' by Beth Williamson 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-280328-X}} pp. 102\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgen del Carmen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The use of Marian [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Brown Scapular]] is a distinguishing feature of Catholic art.]]\nUnlike the majority of the Protestants, the Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Marian images, but in a different manner and with a different emphasis from the Catholic tradition. While statues of the Virgin Mary abound in Catholic churches, there are specific prohibitions against all three-dimensional representations (of Mary or any other any saints) within the Orthodox Church, for they are regarded as remnants of pagan idolatry. Hence the Orthodox only produce and venerate two-dimensional images.<ref name=Benz >''The Eastern Orthodox Church: Its Thought and Life'' by Ernst Benz 2009 {{ISBN|0-202-36298-1}} pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=Mylonas >''Serbian orthodox fundamentals'' by Christos Mylonas 2003 {{ISBN|963-9241-61-X}} pp. 45\u201348</ref><ref name=Flinn >Encyclopedia of Catholicism'' by Frank K.

In fact, there is a three way, carefully coordinated interplay of prayers, icons and [[hymns to Mary]] within Orthodox liturgy, at times with specific feasts that relate to the Theotokos icons and the [[Hymns to Mary|Akathists]].<ref name=Benz /><ref name=Dragas /><ref>''America's religions: from their origins to the twenty-first century'' by Peter W.

The rich background representation of flowers or gardens found in Catholic art are not present in Orthodox depictions whose primary focus is the Theotokos, often with the [[Child Jesus]].<ref name=McPherson >''Keeping silence: Christian practices for entering stillness'' by C.

Alles 2007 {{ISBN|0-8160-6141-6}} pp. 33\u201334</ref> Apparition-based images such as the statues of the [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] accentuate the differences in that they are based on apparitions that are purely Catholic, as well as being three-dimensional representations. And the presence of [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Rosary]] and the [[Brown Scapular]] on the statues of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] emphasize a totally Catholic form of Marian art.\n\nApart from stylistic issues, significant doctrinal differences separate Catholic Marian art from other Christian approaches. Three examples are the depictions that involve the [[Immaculate Conception]], [[Queen of Heaven]] and the [[Assumption of Mary]]. Given that the Immaculate Conception is a mostly Catholic doctrine, its depictions within other Christian traditions remain rare.<ref>Mark Miravalle, 1993, ''Introduction to Mary'', Queenship Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-882972-06-7}} pp. 64\u201370</ref> The same applies to ''Queen of Heaven'', for long an element of Catholic tradition (and eventually the subject of the encyclical ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'') but its representation within themes such as the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] continue to remain mostly Catholic.<ref name=Reginam >[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_11101954_ad-caeli-reginam_en.html Encyclical ''Ad Caeli Reginam'' on the Vatican website]</ref> While the Eastern Orthodox support the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]], they do not support the Catholic doctrines of the [[Assumption of Mary]] and hence their depictions of the dormition are distinct and the Virgin Mary is usually shown sleeping surrounded by saints, while Catholic depictions often show Mary rising to Heaven.<ref name=Dragas >''Ecclesiasticus II: Orthodox Icons, Saints, Feasts and Prayer'' by George Dion Dragas 2005 {{ISBN|0-9745618-0-0}} pp. 177\u2013178</ref><ref>''Butler's Lives of the Saints: August'' by Alban Butler, Paul Burns 1998 {{ISBN|0-86012-257-3}} p. 147</ref>\n\n==Galleries of Marian art==\n\n===[[Perpetual virginity]]===\n:''For a larger gallery, please see: [[Annunciation in Christian art]]\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"110px\" caption=\"Perpetual virginity\">\nImage:Anunciaci\u00f3n (Mariotto).jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Mariotto Albertinelli]], 15th century\nImage:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo 023.jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo|Murillo]], 1655\nFile:L' Annonciation de 1644, Philippe de Champaigne..jpg|[[Philippe de Champaigne]], 1644\nImage:Pietro Perugino cat23.jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Pietro Perugino]], 1489\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens - Annunciation - WGA20250.jpg|[[Rubens]] ''Annunciation'' 1628 [[Antwerp]]\nImage:Sandro Botticelli 080.jpg|[[Cestello Annunciation (Botticelli)|''Cestello Annunciation'']] by [[Botticelli]], 1490\nFile:The Annunciation, by Francesco Albani.jpg|[[Francesco Albani]] ''Annunciation'' [[Hermitage Museum|The Hermitage]]\nFile:Annunciation nesterov.jpg|[[Mikhail Nesterov]], Russia, 19th century\n</gallery>\n\n===[[Nativity of Jesus|Birth of Jesus]]===\n::''For more images, please see'': [[Salome (disciple)#Gallery of art|Salome images]]\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"110px\" caption=\"Birth of Christ\">\nFile:Adoration of the Magi, ivory, 15th century, perhaps South German - Worcester Art Museum - IMG 7516.JPG|''Adoration of the Magi'', ivory, 15th century\nImage:Marten de vos Nativity.jpg|[[Marten de Vos]], 1577\nFile:Lorenzo Lotto 017.jpg|[[Lorenzo Lotto]], 1523\n<!-- Image:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|[[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]], 1490 -->\nFile:Pietro Perugino 015.jpg|[[Pietro Perugino]], 15th century\nImage:Birthofchristwithangelsberruguete.png|[[Pedro Berruguete]], 15th century\nFile:Giorgione 014.jpg|[[Giorgione]], c1507\nFile:Retablo del Nacimiento.
