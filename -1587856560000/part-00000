He was known for performing in [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. Allman grew up with an interest in [[rhythm and blues]] music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with [[rock music]], [[jazz]], and [[country music|country]] at times. He wrote several of the band's biggest songs, including \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\", \"[[Melissa (song)|Melissa]]\", and \"[[Midnight Rider]]\". Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven [[studio album]]s. He was born and spent much of his childhood in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], before relocating to [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]] and then Richmond Hill, Georgia.\n\nHe and his brother, [[Duane Allman]], formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 [[live album]] ''[[At Fillmore East]]''. Shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, with ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'' (1973) their most successful album. Allman began a solo career with ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' the same year, and was perhaps most famous for his marriage to pop star [[Cher]] for the rest of the decade. He had an unexpected late career hit with his cover of the song \"[[I'm No Angel (Bill Medley song)|I'm No Angel]]\" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, ''[[Low Country Blues]]'' (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance abuse, which formed the basis of his memoir ''[[My Cross to Bear]]'' (2012). His final album, ''[[Southern Blood (album)|Southern Blood]]'', was released posthumously on September 8, 2017.\n\nAllman performed with a [[Hammond organ]] and guitar, and was recognized for his soulful voice. For his work in music, Allman was referred to as a [[Southern rock]] pioneer<ref>Sources:\n* {{Cite news |last=Lewis |first=Andy |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-cross-bear-318317 |title=My Cross to Bear |date=April 30, 2012 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=May 27, 2017}}\n* {{Cite news |last=Morris |first=Chris |url=https://variety.com/2017/music/people-news/gregg-allman-dies-dead-69-southern-rock-1202446640/ |title=Gregg Allman, Southern Rock Pioneer, Dies at 69 |date=May 27, 2017 |work=Variety |access-date=May 27, 2017}}\n* {{Cite news |last=Gehr |first=Richard |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/gregg-allman-southern-rock-legend-dead-at-69-w433068 |title=Gregg Allman, Southern Rock Pioneer, Dead at 69 |date=May 27, 2017 |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=May 27, 2017}}</ref> and received numerous awards, including one [[Grammy Award]]; he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Georgia Music Hall of Fame]].

They met a man named [[Floyd Miles]], and they began to jam with his band, the Houserockers. \"I would just sit there and study Floyd ...

These recordings were later released as ''Early Allman'' in 1973, to Allman's dismay.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=72}} He soon grew tired of performing covers and began writing original compositions.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=73}} They settled in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] for a time, where in the spring of 1967 they began performing alongside Johnny Sandlin and [[Paul Hornsby]], among others, under various names.

It contained more original songs by Allman, though they still felt constricted by its process. The band broke up when Duane explicitly told off executives at Liberty. They threatened to [[Non-compete clause|freeze the band]], so they would be unable to record for any other label for seven years.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=96}} Allman stayed behind to appease the label, giving them the rights to a solo album.

He phoned his brother with the proposition of joining the new band\u2014which would have two guitarists and two drummers. With his deal at Liberty fulfilled, he drove to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in March 1969 to jam with the new band.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=109}} He called the birth of the group \"one of the finer days in my life ...

He was known for performing in [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. Allman grew up with an interest in [[rhythm and blues]] music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with [[rock music]], [[jazz]], and [[country music|country]] at times. He wrote several of the band's biggest songs, including \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\", \"[[Melissa (song)|Melissa]]\", and \"[[Midnight Rider]]\". Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven [[studio album]]s. He was born and spent much of his childhood in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], before relocating to [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]] and then Richmond Hill, Georgia.\n\nHe and his brother, [[Duane Allman]], formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 [[live album]] ''[[At Fillmore East]]''. Shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, with ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'' (1973) their most successful album. Allman began a solo career with ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' the same year, and was perhaps most famous for his marriage to pop star [[Cher]] for the rest of the decade. He had an unexpected late career hit with his cover of the song \"[[I'm No Angel (Bill Medley song)|I'm No Angel]]\" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, ''[[Low Country Blues]]'' (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance abuse, which formed the basis of his memoir ''[[My Cross to Bear]]'' (2012).

The AP traditionally employed the \"[[inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]]\" formula for writing which enables the news outlets to edit a story to fit its available publication area without losing the story's essentials.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Associated Press CEO: \"The Inverted Pyramid Is Dead\" |journal=Adweek |date=November 2, 2007 |url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/associated-press-ceo-the-inverted-pyramid-is-dead/}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:the associated press building in new york city.jpg|thumb|upright|Logo on the former AP Building in New York City]]\n\nThe Associated Press was formed in May 1846<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyorknatives.com/on-this-day-in-nycs-history-associated-press-formed/|title=Associated Press Founded - This Day in History May 22|work=New York Natives|date=2015-05-22|accessdate=2016-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324173630/http://newyorknatives.com/on-this-day-in-nycs-history-associated-press-formed/|archive-date=2016-03-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> by five daily newspapers in [[New York City]] to share the cost of transmitting news of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15108618|title=Network effects|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221035608/http://www.economist.com/node/15108618|archive-date=2018-02-21|url-status=live}}</ref> The venture was organized by [[Moses Yale Beach]] (1800\u201368), second publisher of ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', joined by the ''[[New York Herald]]'', the ''[[New York Courier and Enquirer]]'', ''[[The Journal of Commerce]]'', and the ''[[New York Evening Express]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/06/26/the-birth-of-atari-modern-computer-design-and-the-software-industry-this-week-in-tech-history/|title=The Birth of Atari, Modern Computer Design, And The Software Industry: This Week In Tech History|last=Press|first=Gil|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221040359/https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/06/26/the-birth-of-atari-modern-computer-design-and-the-software-industry-this-week-in-tech-history/|archive-date=2018-02-21|url-status=live}}</ref> Some historians<ref name=Tribune>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=Us-kDH5LqHEC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=tribune+associated+press+1849&source=bl&ots=4NXNCQqM_9&sig=ZdCcNzuktOTNGHU4lbzmIfr_x-0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5juSHldPfAhUU6LwKHTWfBFAQ6AEwGnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=tribune%20associated%20press%201849&f=false|title=The Nation's Newsbrokers: The formative years, from pretelegraphs to 1865|last=Schwarzlose|first=Richard Allen|date=1989|publisher=Northwestern University Press|ISBN=9780810108189|page=93|access-date=January 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104124424/https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=Us-kDH5LqHEC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=tribune+associated+press+1849&source=bl&ots=4NXNCQqM_9&sig=ZdCcNzuktOTNGHU4lbzmIfr_x-0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5juSHldPfAhUU6LwKHTWfBFAQ6AEwGnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=tribune%20associated%20press%201849&f=false|archive-date=January 4, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> believe that the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' joined at this time; documents show it was a member in 1849. ''[[The New York Times]]'' became a member shortly after its founding in September 1851. Initially known as the New York Associated Press (NYAP), the organization faced competition from the Western Associated Press (1862), which criticized its monopolistic news gathering and [[price setting]] practices. An investigation completed in 1892 by [[Victor Lawson]], editor and publisher of the ''Chicago Daily News'', revealed that several principals of the NYAP had entered into a secret agreement with United Press, a rival organization, to share NYAP news and the profits of reselling it. The revelations led to the demise of the NYAP and in December 1892, the Western Associated Press was incorporated in Illinois as The Associated Press. A 1900 [[Illinois Supreme Court]] decision (''Inter Ocean Publishing Co. v. Associated Press'')\u2014that the AP was a [[public utility]] and operating in restraint of trade\u2014resulted in AP's move from Chicago to New York City, where corporation laws were more favorable to cooperatives.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nWhen the AP was founded, news became a salable commodity. The invention of the rotary press allowed the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' in the 1870s to print 18,000 papers per hour. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Spanish\u2013American War]], there was a new incentive to print vivid, on-the-spot reporting. [[Melville Stone]], who had founded the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' in 1875, served as AP General Manager from 1893 to 1921. He embraced the standards of accuracy, impartiality, and integrity. The cooperative grew rapidly under the leadership of Kent Cooper (served 1925\u201348), who built up bureau staff in South America, Europe and (after [[World War&nbsp;II]]), the Middle East. He introduced the \"telegraph typewriter\" or teletypewriter into newsrooms in 1914. In 1935, AP launched the Wirephoto network, which allowed transmission of news photographs over leased private telephone lines on the day they were taken. This gave AP a major advantage over other news media outlets. While the first network was only between New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, eventually AP had its network across the whole United States.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA392 |title=Wire That Photo |work=Popular Mechanics |date=July 1937 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in ''[[Associated Press v. United States]]'' that the AP had been violating the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] by prohibiting member newspapers from selling or providing news to nonmember organizations as well as making it very difficult for nonmember newspapers to join the AP. The decision facilitated the growth of its main rival [[United Press International]], headed by [[Hugh Baillie]] from 1935 to 1955.\n\nAP entered the broadcast field in 1941 when it began distributing news to radio stations; it created its own radio network in 1974. In 1994, it established APTV, a global video newsgathering agency. APTV merged with WorldWide Television News in 1998 to form APTN, which provides video to international broadcasters and websites. In 2004, AP moved its world headquarters from its longtime home at 50 Rockefeller Plaza to a huge building at [[Manhattan West|450 West 33rd Street]] in Manhattan\u2014which also houses the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and the studios of New York's public television station, [[WNET]]. In 2009, AP had more than 240 bureaus globally. Its mission\u2014\"to gather with economy and efficiency an accurate and impartial report of the news\"\u2014has not changed since its founding, but digital technology has made the distribution of the AP news report an interactive endeavor between AP and its 1,400 U.S. newspaper members as well as broadcasters, international subscribers, and online customers.\n\nThe AP began diversifying its news gathering capabilities and by 2007 AP was generating only about 30% of its revenue from United States newspapers. 37% came from the global broadcast customers, 15% from online ventures and 18% came from international newspapers and from photography.<ref>{{cite news |title=Down On The Wire |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/13/media-newspapers-ap-biz-media-cx_lh_0214ap.html |quote=Last year, AP generated only about 30% of its revenue from U.S. newspapers.

This relationship involved the Buro Laux, run by the photographer, [[Helmut Laux]].\n\nThe mechanism for this interchange was that a courier flew to Lisbon and back each day transporting photos from and for Germany's wartime enemy, the US, via diplomatic pouch. The transactions were initially conducted at the AP bureau under Luiz Lupi in Lisbon, and from 1944, when the exchange via Lisbon took too long, also at the AP bureau in Stockholm under Eddie Shanke. Here, as a cover, the Swedish agency, {{Ill|Pressens Bild|sv}}, was involved as an intermediary. An estimated 40,000 photos were exchanged between the enemies in this way.<ref>{{cite web|trans-title='Secret Photos.

The AP news report, distributed to its members and customers, is produced in English, Spanish and Arabic. The AP has earned 53 [[Pulitzer Prizes]], including 31 for photography, since the award was established in 1917.\n\nThe AP has counted the vote in U.S. elections since 1848, including national, state and local races down to the legislative level in all 50 states, along with key ballot measures. The AP collects and verifies returns in every county, parish, city and town across the U.S., and declares winners in over 5,000 contests.\n\n{{as of|2016}}, news collected by the AP was published and republished by more than 1,300 newspapers and broadcasters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ap.org/about/annual-report/2016/AssociatedPress_2016FinancialStatements.pdf|title=2016 Consolidated Financial Statements|date=April 5, 2017|website=Associated Press|access-date=March 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304172429/https://www.ap.org/about/annual-report/2016/AssociatedPress_2016FinancialStatements.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The AP operates 263 [[news bureau]]s in 106 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ap.org/about/annual-report/2016/ap-by-the-numbers.html|title=A look at the AP through AP stats and figures|date=2016|website=Associated Press|access-date=March 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513025155/https://www.ap.org/about/annual-report/2016/ap-by-the-numbers.html|archive-date=May 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It also operates the AP Radio Network, which provides newscasts twice hourly for broadcast and satellite radio and television stations.

''[[The New York Times]]'' became a member shortly after its founding in September 1851. Initially known as the New York Associated Press (NYAP), the organization faced competition from the Western Associated Press (1862), which criticized its monopolistic news gathering and [[price setting]] practices. An investigation completed in 1892 by [[Victor Lawson]], editor and publisher of the ''Chicago Daily News'', revealed that several principals of the NYAP had entered into a secret agreement with United Press, a rival organization, to share NYAP news and the profits of reselling it. The revelations led to the demise of the NYAP and in December 1892, the Western Associated Press was incorporated in Illinois as The Associated Press. A 1900 [[Illinois Supreme Court]] decision (''Inter Ocean Publishing Co. v. Associated Press'')\u2014that the AP was a [[public utility]] and operating in restraint of trade\u2014resulted in AP's move from Chicago to New York City, where corporation laws were more favorable to cooperatives.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nWhen the AP was founded, news became a salable commodity. The invention of the rotary press allowed the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' in the 1870s to print 18,000 papers per hour. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Spanish\u2013American War]], there was a new incentive to print vivid, on-the-spot reporting. [[Melville Stone]], who had founded the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' in 1875, served as AP General Manager from 1893 to 1921. He embraced the standards of accuracy, impartiality, and integrity. The cooperative grew rapidly under the leadership of Kent Cooper (served 1925\u201348), who built up bureau staff in South America, Europe and (after [[World War&nbsp;II]]), the Middle East. He introduced the \"telegraph typewriter\" or teletypewriter into newsrooms in 1914. In 1935, AP launched the Wirephoto network, which allowed transmission of news photographs over leased private telephone lines on the day they were taken. This gave AP a major advantage over other news media outlets. While the first network was only between New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, eventually AP had its network across the whole United States.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA392 |title=Wire That Photo |work=Popular Mechanics |date=July 1937 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in ''[[Associated Press v. United States]]'' that the AP had been violating the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] by prohibiting member newspapers from selling or providing news to nonmember organizations as well as making it very difficult for nonmember newspapers to join the AP. The decision facilitated the growth of its main rival [[United Press International]], headed by [[Hugh Baillie]] from 1935 to 1955.\n\nAP entered the broadcast field in 1941 when it began distributing news to radio stations; it created its own radio network in 1974. In 1994, it established APTV, a global video newsgathering agency. APTV merged with WorldWide Television News in 1998 to form APTN, which provides video to international broadcasters and websites. In 2004, AP moved its world headquarters from its longtime home at 50 Rockefeller Plaza to a huge building at [[Manhattan West|450 West 33rd Street]] in Manhattan\u2014which also houses the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and the studios of New York's public television station, [[WNET]].

This relationship involved the Buro Laux, run by the photographer, [[Helmut Laux]].\n\nThe mechanism for this interchange was that a courier flew to Lisbon and back each day transporting photos from and for Germany's wartime enemy, the US, via diplomatic pouch. The transactions were initially conducted at the AP bureau under Luiz Lupi in Lisbon, and from 1944, when the exchange via Lisbon took too long, also at the AP bureau in Stockholm under Eddie Shanke.

It is the largest of the historical tribes, occupying the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East. The tribe (''pleme'') is one of seven Highland tribes (Vasojevi\u0107i, [[Mora\u010dani]], [[Rov\u010dani]], [[Bratono\u017ei\u0107i]], [[Ku\u010di]], [[Piperi clan|Piperi]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i (clan)|Bjelopavli\u0107i]]). Vasojevi\u0107i is also the name of the region inhabited by the Vasojevi\u0107i. Most of the tribe's history prior to the 16th century has naturally been passed on through [[oral history]].\n\nAlthough the unofficial center is [[Andrijevica]] in north-eastern Montenegro, the tribe stems from Lijeva Rijeka in central Montenegro. The tribe was formed by various tribes that were united under the rule of the central Vasojevi\u0107 tribe. These tribes later migrated to the [[Komovi Mountains|Komovi]] mountains and the area of [[Lim River|Lim]]. The emigration continued into what is today [[Serbia]] and other parts of [[Montenegro]].\n\nThough sense of tribal affiliation diminished in recent years, is not a thing of a past. Tribal association and organizations still exist (e.g. Udru\u017eenje Vasojevi\u0107a \"Vaso\"). It could be clearly seen during the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum]] with the Vasojevi\u0107i united opposition.\n\n==Geography==\nIt occupies the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe oldest mention of the Vasojevi\u0107i dates to 1444, where it is described as not a tribe, but as an ethnic group (a people).

There he was received by Vaso and his sons, who all gave him a gift respectively: Rajo a sword, Novak a horse, and Mijoman a gun. However, suddenly there was a shout to the arms as the enemy was approaching, and both Novak and Mijo took their gifts back. Rajo, on the other hand, did not want to, so he equipped himself with another weapon.

It is the largest of the historical tribes, occupying the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East. The tribe (''pleme'') is one of seven Highland tribes (Vasojevi\u0107i, [[Mora\u010dani]], [[Rov\u010dani]], [[Bratono\u017ei\u0107i]], [[Ku\u010di]], [[Piperi clan|Piperi]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i (clan)|Bjelopavli\u0107i]]). Vasojevi\u0107i is also the name of the region inhabited by the Vasojevi\u0107i. Most of the tribe's history prior to the 16th century has naturally been passed on through [[oral history]].\n\nAlthough the unofficial center is [[Andrijevica]] in north-eastern Montenegro, the tribe stems from Lijeva Rijeka in central Montenegro. The tribe was formed by various tribes that were united under the rule of the central Vasojevi\u0107 tribe. These tribes later migrated to the [[Komovi Mountains|Komovi]] mountains and the area of [[Lim River|Lim]]. The emigration continued into what is today [[Serbia]] and other parts of [[Montenegro]].\n\nThough sense of tribal affiliation diminished in recent years, is not a thing of a past. Tribal association and organizations still exist (e.g. Udru\u017eenje Vasojevi\u0107a \"Vaso\"). It could be clearly seen during the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum]] with the Vasojevi\u0107i united opposition.\n\n==Geography==\nIt occupies the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe oldest mention of the Vasojevi\u0107i dates to 1444, where it is described as not a tribe, but as an ethnic group (a people).

Rajo, on the other hand, did not want to, so he equipped himself with another weapon.

The highway crosses the [[Willow Creek Summit]] at {{convert|7161|ft}} ([http://birice.vaisala.com/photos/02DA39EF_05C41D33_cam1.jpg web-cam]) and later descends into Grand View Canyon and heads into the city of [[Challis, Idaho|Challis]].\n\nUS&#8209;93 creates the northern terminus of [[Idaho State Highway 75|State Highway 75]] just south of Challis and takes over as the northern leg of the ''Salmon River Scenic Byway''.<ref>[http://www.idahobyways.gov/byways/salmon-river.aspx Idaho Scenic Byways - Salmon River] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922231545/http://www.idahobyways.gov/byways/salmon-river.aspx |date=2012-09-22 }}</ref> It descends with the [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]] as it winds north around the edge of the [[Lost River Range|Lost River]] and Lemhi mountain ranges into the city of [[Salmon, Idaho|Salmon]] at {{convert|4004|ft}}.\n\nContinuing north, the US&#8209;93 runs along portions of the [[Lewis and Clark Trail]]. The highway follows the descending northbound river until [[North Fork, Idaho|North Fork]] at {{convert|3620|ft}}, where the Salmon River makes a left turn to flow west across the state to [[Riggins, Idaho|Riggins]]. U&#8209;93 continues north, climbing the North Fork of the Salmon River into the [[Bitterroot Mountains|Bitterroot Range]], passing through the [[Salmon-Challis National Forest]] and Gibbonsville. The highway exits Idaho at [[Lost Trail Pass]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20090416040619/http://hb.511.idaho.gov/cameras/Lost_Trail_Pass.html web-cam]) at {{convert|7014|ft}} and enters [[Montana]] toward the [[Bitterroot Valley]].  West of the highway at the pass is the [[Lost Trail Powder Mountain]] [[ski area]], with terrain in both states.\n\n==History==\nUS&#8209;93 was established in 1926, initially using the modern-day route of [[Idaho State Highway 75|SH&#8209;75]] between [[Shoshone, Idaho|Shoshone]] and [[Challis, Idaho|Challis]]. The highway was re-aligned to its modern route via [[Arco, Idaho|Arco]] in 1977, replacing an alternative route.<ref>{{AASHTO minutes |year=1976A |page=2 |access-date=February 14, 2017 |link=yes}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the {{convert|5.5|mi|km|adj=mid}} Pole Line Road bypass around [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]] opened to traffic.<ref>{{cite news |last=Coltrain |first=Nick |date=December 17, 2010 |title=Bypass opens possibilities on Pole Line; Washington Street brakes for winter |url=http://magicvalley.com/news/local/twin-falls/bypass-opens-possibilities-on-pole-line-washington-street-brakes-for/article_6f3504b9-f902-5e81-b205-cbfe59662efe.html |work=[[Times-News (Idaho)|The Times-News]] |location=Twin Falls, Idaho |accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref> US&nbsp;93 was re-routed to the new bypass, while the old route was signed as [[U.S. Route 93 Business (Twin Falls, Idaho)|US&nbsp;93 Business]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=200px>\nFile:U.S. Highway 93 bridge over Snake River Canyon near Twin Falls, Idaho.jpeg|The [[Perrine Bridge]] near [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]]\nFile:grand view canyon1 id.jpg|Grand View Canyon ([[U.S. Route 93#Idaho|US 93]] between [[Mackay, Idaho|Mackay]] & [[Challis, Idaho|Challis]])\nFile:Mount Borah 2009.JPG| [[Borah Peak]], Idaho's tallest mountain, viewed from U.S. Route 93 in Idaho\nFile:US 93 in Idaho.jpeg| US 93 in Idaho\nFile:Salmon River.jpeg|Salmon River\nFile:US 93 along Salmon River.jpeg|US 93 along Salmon River\nFile:US Route 93 in Idaho.jpeg|US Route 93 in Idaho\n</gallery>\n\n== Major intersections ==\n{{jcttop|length_ref=<ref name=\"MPLog\"/>}}\n{{IDint\n|county=Twin Falls\n|cspan=5\n|location=none\n|mile=0.000\n|road={{Jct|state=NV|US|93|dir1=south|city1=Jackpot|city2=Wells}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[Nevada]]}}\n{{IDint\n|location=Godwin\n|mile=38.050\n|road={{Jct|state=ID|SH|74|dir1=east|city1=Twin Falls}}\n}}\n{{IDint\n|location=none\n|mile=41.498\n|road={{Jct|state=ID|US-Bus|93|dab1=Twin Falls|dir1=north|US|30|name2=Idaho Byway|city1=Filer|location2=[[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls City Center]]|city3=Boise}}\n|notes=Interchange}}\n{{IDint\n|location=none\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=\n|road=Pole Line Road / 4100 North\n|notes=Interchange; southbound exit and northbound entrance}}\n{{IDint\n|location=Twin Falls\n|mile=49.455\n|road={{Jctname|state=ID|US-Bus|93|dab1=Twin Falls|dir1=south|name1=Blue Lakes Boulevard south|noshield=yes}}\n|notes=}}\n{{jctbridge\n|river=[[Snake River]]\n|mile=\n|bridge=I.B.
