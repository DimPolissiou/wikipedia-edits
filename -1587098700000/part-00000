During her early career, she worked under her [[birth name]] {{nihongo|'''Yumi Arai'''|\u8352\u4e95 \u7531\u5b9f|Arai Yumi}}. In 1975, Arai became known as a composer for \"''Ichigo Hakusho'' wo Mou Ichido\", a commercially successful song recorded by the folk duo BanBan. She also gained popularity as a vocalist in the same year through the success of \"Ano Hi ni Kaeritai\", which became her first number-one hit on Japan's [[Oricon Charts]].\n\nAfter marrying her musical collaborator [[Masataka Matsutoya]] in 1976, Arai began recording under her married name and has continued to do so. Throughout the 1980s, Matsutoya's music was prominently featured in advertisements for [[Mitsubishi Motors]] in her native Japan and her image was used to promote their vehicles. In addition to multiple hit singles, she has obtained enormous commercial success on the Japanese Albums Chart, particularly during the late 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nYumi Arai was born in 1954 in [[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]]. She had three brothers and one sister, and her family ran a draper shop called Arai Gofukuten, established in 1912. When she was a [[Middle school|junior high school]] student, she used to go to an Italian restaurant called Chianti, started in 1960. In those days, many celebrities went to the restaurant; [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Yukio Mishima]], [[K\u014db\u014d Abe]], [[Seiji Ozawa]], [[Ryu Murakami]], [[Taro Okamoto]], [[Kishin Shinoyama]], and [[Hiroshi \"Monsieur\" Kamayatsu]], who eventually became her first record producer.<ref name=\"a\">''Chianti Monogatari'', Tsuneyoshi Noji, Gentosha Inc, {{ISBN|978-4-87728-494-7}}</ref> Alfa Records, the label to which she belonged early her in career, was founded by people who were regular customers at Chianti.\n\nHer nickname \"Yuming\" was given to her by Sy Chen ([[:ja:\u30b7\u30fc\u30fb\u30e6\u30fc\u30fb\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3|\u30b7\u30fc\u30fb\u30e6\u30fc\u30fb\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3]]), a Chinese bassist she had a crush on when she was 13 years old. She began her music career when she was still young. At the age of 14, she worked as a musician for the first time. Having worked as a studio musician, she also wrote many original songs. When she was 17 years old, her first original song titled \"Ai wa Totsuzen ni\" was released. It was sung by Katsumi Kahashi, the former guitarist of the influential 1960s Japanese band [[The Tigers (Japanese band)|The Tigers]].\n\nIn April 1972, Arai entered [[Tama Art University]]. At the same time, she signed with Alfa as a music artist. At first, she wanted to be a songwriter. However, the founder of the record company, Kunihiko Murai, encouraged her to work as a singer-songwriter.\n\n===Music career===\n\n====Early career; works as Yumi Arai====\nOn July 5, 1972, Arai released her debut single \"Henji wa Iranai\". It was produced by Hiroshi \"Monsieur\" Kamayatsu, the former vocalist of The Spiders. Her first single sold only 300 copies.\n\nShe recorded her first full album, ''Hik\u014dki-gumo'', with the band Caramel Mama, better known as Tin Pan Alley, which consisted of Haruomi Hosono, Shigeru Suzuki, Tateo Hayashi and Masataka Matsutoya, and it was released in November 1973; the song \"Hik\u014dki-gumo\" was later used as the theme song for the movie ''[[The Wind Rises]]'' (2013). For her next album, ''Misslim'', (1974), Masataka Matsutoya, who was the keyboardist of Tin Pan Alley, arranged all of her songs. Her third studio album, ''[[Cobalt Hour]]'' (1975), features her early famous song \"Sotsugy\u014d Shashin\". The same year, it was covered by the chorus group [[Hi-fi Set]] on their first album with the same name. That cover version also succeeded as a single. In later years, it was covered by many Japanese artists and became one of Japan's classic pop songs. The same year, the male folk duo BanBan recorded her song \"Ichigo Hakusho o Mou Ichido\" and reached number one on the Oricon chart. Because of the commercial success of other artists, she became famous as a songwriter.\n\nYumi achieved moderate success with her fifth single, ''Rouge no Dengon'' (\"Rouge Message\"), an up-tempo song considered to be a proto ''J-Pop'' classic.  She gained a television appearance singing this song with the top Japanese girl group of the time, ''Candies'', and the song has been covered by a number of artists over the years.\n\nHer first top hit as a singer-songwriter was her sixth single \"Ano Hi ni Kaeritai\". In August 1975, it was used as the theme song for the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] TV drama ''Katei no Himitsu''. Two months later, it was released as a single and reached the top of the Oricon chart. ''The 14th Moon'' (1976), her final album as Yumi Arai, featured [[Leland Sklar]] on bass and [[Mike Baird (musician)|Mike Baird]] on drums. Since this album, Masataka Matsutoya has produced all her albums himself. She considers her nickname \"Yuming\" to also mean the name of the union with her husband. Following the success with \"Ano Hi ni Kaeritai\", it became her first album to reach number one on the Oricon chart. Besides, in the end of the year chart in 1976, three of her albums ranked in the top 10.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070217212244/http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~yamag/nenkan1976_a.html ]</ref> Four years after her debut, she dominated the Japanese album charts. This astonishing record has never been broken by anyone since.\n\nIn 1989, her fifth single \"Rouge no Dengon\" and another song, \"Yasashisa ni Tsutsumaretanara\" (from her second album), were featured as the theme songs of the film ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''. Nowadays, those tunes are known as her early notable songs. Some of her songs were deeply influenced by many American and European musicians, such as [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Carole King]]. As a pioneering singer-songwriter who mixed Western culture and Japanese pop, she left a strong impression on Japanese popular music.\n\n====Works as Yumi Matsutoya====\nAfter marrying Masataka Matsutoya on November 29, 1976, she had considered retirement. But eventually she decided to continue to work as a musician, and changed her stage name to her new family name, Yumi Matsutoya. In 1978, her memorable first album as Yumi Matsutoya, entitled ''Benisuzume'' was released. In the late 1970s and early 80s, she released two albums every year. However, those albums were less successful than the ones she released when she was single. Nevertheless, she wrote several of her well-known songs during those years, and her albums reached the top 10 on the Oricon chart.\n\nBefore the release of ''Benisuzume'', a compilation named ''Album'' was released by Toshiba EMI. It mainly contained songs she had released as Yumi Arai, and two songs released as singles only. Matsutoya didn't want to release this compilation; in her autobiography released in 1982, she writes about this album and calls it \"The biggest stain on my music career.\"<ref name=\"b\">''Rouge no Dengon'', Yumi Matsutoya, Kadokawa Shoten Publishing Co., Ltd., {{ISBN|978-4-04-158001-1}}</ref> Because of this, she never allowed the release of another compilation album until 1998. However, her ex-record-label Alfa Records had released many compilations which consisted of her old tunes without her permission. Hence, in the late 1990s, she bought the copyrights of all her songs that she had written under her maiden name.\n\nHer tenth album, ''Surf and Snow'' (1980), changed the negative tide for her. When the album was released, it did not sell as well as others had previously. However, in 1986, \"Koibito ga Santa Claus\" became popular as the theme song for the hit movie ''Watashi wo Ski ni Tsuretette''. The album eventually sold over 400,000 copies. In 1987, she returned to the top of Japanese pop music. Her husband wrote the score for the movie ''Nerawareta Gakuen'', which was directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi and distributed by Kadokawa Pictures. She wrote \"Mamotte Agetai\" as the theme song for the movie. The single of this song reached number two on Oricon and sold nearly 700,000 copies. Following the success of the single, her eleventh album ''Sakuban Oaishimasho'' (1981) became her second number one album. From that year through 1997, 17 consecutive studio albums she released reached number one on the Oricon charts.\n\nIn 1982, she published an autobiography, ''Rouge no Dengon''. In this book, she wrote about her life in an exaggerated style. She contemplated doing the artwork on her own albums. The artwork of the album ''Sakuban Oaishimasho'' (1981) was designed by [[Hipgnosis]], and the video ''Compartment'' was produced by [[Storm Thorgerson]], [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]] and [[Peter Christopherson]]. A logo design from the latter film also became the logo of \"Yuming\", and was used as the cover of the 1984 album ''No Side''. [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]] and [[Richard Evans (designer)|Richard Evans]] of [[Hipgnosis]] also designed the cover of the 1983 album \"Voyager\". Since the 1970s, she has also been famous as an artist who performs in concerts using gorgeous and novel sets. She used elaborate visual technology on the stage and it is said that they cost over a hundred million yen. She has released two live albums and several videos. In 1986, she released her first live album, ''Yuming Visualive DA-DI-DA,''. It was released on CD and cassette tape only, and it became one of the rarest items among her fans for many years.\n\n====Commercial peak and decline====\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, her albums consisted of mechanical sounds which featured [[synclavier]]. In addition, they were recorded by a lot of famous West Coast musicians. However, in later years, Masataka Matsutoya, her record producer and husband, regretted the cheap rhythm section on those albums. ''Before the Diamond Dust Fades....'' (1987) sold more than any of her albums at that time. In the late 1980s, her record sales increased. ''Delight Slight Light KISS'' (1988) became the first million-selling record for her. From this album in 1995 to the album ''Kathmandu'', she released eight studio albums and all of them sold over million copies. Above all, two of those albums, ''The Gates of Heaven'' (1990), and ''The Dancing Sun'' (1994), sold over double-million copies. The former is the first double million-selling album in Japan. ''Dawn Purple'' (1991) sold over a million copies in one week after the album's release. Her record sales were appraised by the Japanese music industry. ''Before the Diamond Dust Fades...'' won [[Japan Record Award]]s of 1988 and ''The Gates of Heaven'' won a Japanese gold disc grand prix of 1991.\n\n''The Gates of Heaven'' and several of her albums in those years reflected an optimistic atmosphere in Japan caused by the [[Japanese asset price bubble|asset price bubble]] around the end of the 1980s and early 1990s. She was often called \"Charisma of Youth\" or \"The Enthusiastic Leader of Love\" in those days. After hearing from her record company [[EMI Music Japan|Toshiba-EMI]] that single sales were quickly overtaking album sales due to a slowing economy, Matsutoya decided to make a difference. To make people buy the album, she did not release any physical singles at all for about four years in the early 1990s, although she did promote songs from her albums to radio as \"album cuts\". Her albums ''The Gates of Heaven'' (1990), ''Dawn Purple'' (1991) and ''Tears And Reasons'' (1992) performed very well on the [[Oricon]] charts, boosted partially by airplay. However, in autumn 1993, she released \"Manatsu no Yo no Yume\", the first physical single in four years since \"Anniversary\", already known as the theme song of the TV drama ''Dare nimo Ienai''. It sold over 1,400,000 copies and became the 89th best-selling single in Japan. It is her most successful single.\n\nThe next year, she produced the two-million-selling singles called \"Hello,My Friend\" and \"Haru-yo, Koi\". Both of these singles were used in TV dramas (the former was featured on ''Kimi to Ita Natsu'', the latter was used on the same titled program broadcast by [[NHK]]). The latter in particular is famous as one of her standard numbers. Those songs were also included on the album ''The Dancing Sun'', which became her second double million-selling album on the strength of those popular tunes. That same year, the equity ratio of her record company (which was originally established by [[Toshiba|Toshiba Corporation]] in 1960 as '''Toshiba Musical Industries''', and then renamed '''Toshiba-EMI''' when Toshiba sold 50% of the company to the British [[EMI|EMI Group]] in 1973) was changed, with EMI now owning a 55% stake in the company, while Toshiba owned the remaining 45% stake in the company.\n \nShe was interested in the [[Spirit|spiritual world]] for many years, and this preference was often represented in her songs, a tendency that became deeper in the 1990s.\n\nIn August 1996, about twenty years after her marriage, Yumi Matsutoya came back as Yumi Arai and performed three days at Nakano Sunplaza, Tokyo. Excerpts of that live recording were released on video and CD. A month before the live performances, a newly recorded version of her early standard song, \"Machibuse\" (she did not sing it herself), was released as a single. Until 1995, she had released studio albums every year, but her popularity began to decline around 1996. After her twenty-ninth studio album, ''The Waves of Zuvuya'', (1997) her record sale declined more and more.\n\nAs \"Yumi Matsutoya\", she had not released any compilation albums since 1977. Formerly, she didn't want to release compilation albums. However, in 1998, she released a double album compilation, ''Neue Musik: Yumi Matsutoya Complete Best Vol. 1''. It included 28 songs and two new songs recorded with the former members of Tin-Pan-Alley. In addition, several songs of this album were selected by votes by her fans. At this stage, it is her biggest-selling and final four million-selling album.\n\n====Recent years====\nAfter the release of her well-sold compilation album, she declared that she would make the music she wants to. From 1999 on, she has released eight studio albums.\n\nOn June 30, 2007, [[Toshiba|Toshiba Corporation]] sold its remaining 45% stake in Matsutoya's record label to [[EMI]] and gave EMI full ownership of the company.  The label's name was then changed from '''Toshiba-EMI''' to '''EMI Music Japan''' to reflect Toshiba's divestiture from the business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emimusic.jp/company/pdf/emi20070629.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095500/http://www.emimusic.jp/company/pdf/emi20070629.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 29, 2007|title=Wayback Machine|date=September 29, 2007|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}</ref> In September 2012, the British [[EMI]] group was broken up and sold to various companies.

Some of them became big hits, such as \"Ichigo Hakusho o Mou Ichido\" (Performed by Banban, 1975) and \"Machibuse\" (Performed by Seiko Miki, Hitomi Ishikawa, originally released in 1975). Many of her hit tunes were sung by idol singer [[Seiko Matsuda]]. Several songs sung by Matsuda reached number one on the Oricon singles chart, including \"Akai Sweet Pea\", \"Nagisa no Balcony\" (1982) and \"Hitomi wa Diamond\" (1986). These singles are some of Matsuda's best-known songs. Matsutoya has collaborated with many songwriters and lyricists, among them [[Yosui Inoue]], [[Takashi Matsumoto (lyricist)|Takashi Matsumoto]], [[K\u014dki Mitani]], [[Kunihiko Kase]], [[Shizuka Ijuin]]. She also co-wrote the Japanese lyrics to the [[Lynsey de Paul]] and [[Barry Blue]] penned song [[Sugar Shuffle]] with Asami Kobayashi, which appeared on Kobayashi's Cryptograph album in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Asami-Kobayashi-\u5c0f\u6797\u9ebb\u7f8e-Cryptograph-\u611b\u306e\u6697\u53f7/release/8338432|title=Asami Kobayashi = \u5c0f\u6797\u9ebb\u7f8e* \u2013 Cryptograph = \u611b\u306e\u6697\u53f7|publisher=discogs|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}</ref> When she writes songs for other musicians, she often uses the pseudonym {{nihongo|''Kureta Karuho''|\u5449\u7530\u8efd\u7a42}}. It is a parody on the name of [[Greta Garbo]].\n\n===Collaboration with other artists===\nOn her early albums, several famous 1970s Japanese singer-songwriters who had not yet succeeded at that time sang as the backing vocalists; [[Tatsuro Yamashita]], [[Taeko Onuki]], [[Akiko Yano]] and [[Minako Yoshida]]. Yamashita usually arranged the chorus parts of her songs in the '70s. But in later years, he criticized her late 1980s music career in his own song called \"Queen of Hype Blues\". In her career spanning more than 30 years, Matsutoya has sung duets with many singers; including Takao Kisugi, [[Toshinobu Kubota]], [[Masumi Okada]], and [[Original Love (Japanese musician)|Takao Tajima]].\n\nShe has also recorded several collaboration singles with other musicians. In 1985, she released the song \"Imadakara\" with [[Kazumasa Oda]] and Kazuo Zaitsu. It was mostly composed by Oda and Matsutoya, arranged by [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and played by former [[Sadistic Mika Band]] members. At the live event performed in June the same year, having added Matsutoya as vocalist, the band reunited as \"Sadistic Yuming Band\" and performed this song.\n\nIn 1986, Matsutoya  co-wrote \"Kissin' Christmas\", a theme song for a TV program, with [[Keisuke Kuwata]], the leader of [[Southern All Stars]]. Appearing only on TV, this song was a collaboration by two of the most successful Japanese songwriters. However, the song has never been released on any format.\n\nIn 1992, Matsutoya and [[Tatsuya Ishii|Karl Smokey Ishii]] cooperated for the single \"Ai no Wave\". She wrote it and the B-Side \"Roman no Dengon\" with him. The same year, Ishii had released \"Kimi ga Irudake de\", the fifth best-selling single in Japan. Therefore, the single climbed to the top of the hit parade naturally. The title of \"Roman no Gengon\" was self-parody of their songs; it was named under Matsutoya's \"Rouge no Dengon\" and Kome Kome Club's \"Roman Hikou\".\n\nWhen her popularity quickly declined at the end of the 1990s, she recorded a song with the popular group [[Pocket Biscuits]]. They collaborated on the single \"Millennium\" in 2000, but it did not achieve the expected success.\n\nIn 2002, she penned the song \"Koi no Signal\" for the group Coming Century, a sub-unit of the popular boyband [[V6 (band)|V6]]. Compared to other Coming Century songs of the time, the lyrics for the song were more heartfelt and optimistic.\n\nIn 2005, Matsutoya formed the group called \"Yumi Matsutoya and Friends of Love the Earth\" with four East Asian artists; [[Dick Lee]] from Singapore, [[Lim Hyung Joo]] from [[South Korea]], [[Amin (Chinese singer)|amin]] and Xu Ke from China. \nMatsutoya wrote the song \"Smile Again\" for the new group, and it was released on iTMS only. When Matsutoya appeared at the [[Expo 2005]] concert in September of the same year, they appeared as guests and sang this song. On New Year's Eve the same year, they appeared in the Japanese traditional annual TV music program ''[[Kohaku Uta Gassen]]'', and performed \"Smile Again\". The next year, Matsutoya re-recorded the song and released it on her album ''A Girl in Summer''. In autumn of 2006, this unit added more members. They had only one concert and released the new single \"Knockin' at the Door\" on CD.\n\nIn 2006, she wrote a song \"Still Crazy for You\" for [[Crazy Cats]], a Japanese comedy team popular in the late 1950s and 1960s, and sung a duet with the vocalist [[Kei Tani]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zakzak.co.jp/gei/2006_04/g2006041212.html |title=ZAKZAK |publisher=ZAKZAK |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522225752/http://www.zakzak.co.jp/gei/2006_04/g2006041212.html |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was released as the group's first new single since 1986, and climbed to No. 14 on the Oricon chart.

During her early career, she worked under her [[birth name]] {{nihongo|'''Yumi Arai'''|\u8352\u4e95 \u7531\u5b9f|Arai Yumi}}. In 1975, Arai became known as a composer for \"''Ichigo Hakusho'' wo Mou Ichido\", a commercially successful song recorded by the folk duo BanBan. She also gained popularity as a vocalist in the same year through the success of \"Ano Hi ni Kaeritai\", which became her first number-one hit on Japan's [[Oricon Charts]].\n\nAfter marrying her musical collaborator [[Masataka Matsutoya]] in 1976, Arai began recording under her married name and has continued to do so. Throughout the 1980s, Matsutoya's music was prominently featured in advertisements for [[Mitsubishi Motors]] in her native Japan and her image was used to promote their vehicles. In addition to multiple hit singles, she has obtained enormous commercial success on the Japanese Albums Chart, particularly during the late 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nYumi Arai was born in 1954 in [[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]]. She had three brothers and one sister, and her family ran a draper shop called Arai Gofukuten, established in 1912. When she was a [[Middle school|junior high school]] student, she used to go to an Italian restaurant called Chianti, started in 1960. In those days, many celebrities went to the restaurant; [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Yukio Mishima]], [[K\u014db\u014d Abe]], [[Seiji Ozawa]], [[Ryu Murakami]], [[Taro Okamoto]], [[Kishin Shinoyama]], and [[Hiroshi \"Monsieur\" Kamayatsu]], who eventually became her first record producer.<ref name=\"a\">''Chianti Monogatari'', Tsuneyoshi Noji, Gentosha Inc, {{ISBN|978-4-87728-494-7}}</ref> Alfa Records, the label to which she belonged early her in career, was founded by people who were regular customers at Chianti.\n\nHer nickname \"Yuming\" was given to her by Sy Chen ([[:ja:\u30b7\u30fc\u30fb\u30e6\u30fc\u30fb\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3|\u30b7\u30fc\u30fb\u30e6\u30fc\u30fb\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3]]), a Chinese bassist she had a crush on when she was 13 years old. She began her music career when she was still young. At the age of 14, she worked as a musician for the first time. Having worked as a studio musician, she also wrote many original songs. When she was 17 years old, her first original song titled \"Ai wa Totsuzen ni\" was released. It was sung by Katsumi Kahashi, the former guitarist of the influential 1960s Japanese band [[The Tigers (Japanese band)|The Tigers]].\n\nIn April 1972, Arai entered [[Tama Art University]]. At the same time, she signed with Alfa as a music artist. At first, she wanted to be a songwriter. However, the founder of the record company, Kunihiko Murai, encouraged her to work as a singer-songwriter.\n\n===Music career===\n\n====Early career; works as Yumi Arai====\nOn July 5, 1972, Arai released her debut single \"Henji wa Iranai\". It was produced by Hiroshi \"Monsieur\" Kamayatsu, the former vocalist of The Spiders. Her first single sold only 300 copies.\n\nShe recorded her first full album, ''Hik\u014dki-gumo'', with the band Caramel Mama, better known as Tin Pan Alley, which consisted of Haruomi Hosono, Shigeru Suzuki, Tateo Hayashi and Masataka Matsutoya, and it was released in November 1973; the song \"Hik\u014dki-gumo\" was later used as the theme song for the movie ''[[The Wind Rises]]'' (2013). For her next album, ''Misslim'', (1974), Masataka Matsutoya, who was the keyboardist of Tin Pan Alley, arranged all of her songs. Her third studio album, ''[[Cobalt Hour]]'' (1975), features her early famous song \"Sotsugy\u014d Shashin\". The same year, it was covered by the chorus group [[Hi-fi Set]] on their first album with the same name. That cover version also succeeded as a single. In later years, it was covered by many Japanese artists and became one of Japan's classic pop songs. The same year, the male folk duo BanBan recorded her song \"Ichigo Hakusho o Mou Ichido\" and reached number one on the Oricon chart. Because of the commercial success of other artists, she became famous as a songwriter.\n\nYumi achieved moderate success with her fifth single, ''Rouge no Dengon'' (\"Rouge Message\"), an up-tempo song considered to be a proto ''J-Pop'' classic.  She gained a television appearance singing this song with the top Japanese girl group of the time, ''Candies'', and the song has been covered by a number of artists over the years.\n\nHer first top hit as a singer-songwriter was her sixth single \"Ano Hi ni Kaeritai\". In August 1975, it was used as the theme song for the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] TV drama ''Katei no Himitsu''. Two months later, it was released as a single and reached the top of the Oricon chart. ''The 14th Moon'' (1976), her final album as Yumi Arai, featured [[Leland Sklar]] on bass and [[Mike Baird (musician)|Mike Baird]] on drums. Since this album, Masataka Matsutoya has produced all her albums himself. She considers her nickname \"Yuming\" to also mean the name of the union with her husband. Following the success with \"Ano Hi ni Kaeritai\", it became her first album to reach number one on the Oricon chart. Besides, in the end of the year chart in 1976, three of her albums ranked in the top 10.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070217212244/http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~yamag/nenkan1976_a.html ]</ref> Four years after her debut, she dominated the Japanese album charts. This astonishing record has never been broken by anyone since.\n\nIn 1989, her fifth single \"Rouge no Dengon\" and another song, \"Yasashisa ni Tsutsumaretanara\" (from her second album), were featured as the theme songs of the film ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''. Nowadays, those tunes are known as her early notable songs. Some of her songs were deeply influenced by many American and European musicians, such as [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Carole King]]. As a pioneering singer-songwriter who mixed Western culture and Japanese pop, she left a strong impression on Japanese popular music.\n\n====Works as Yumi Matsutoya====\nAfter marrying Masataka Matsutoya on November 29, 1976, she had considered retirement. But eventually she decided to continue to work as a musician, and changed her stage name to her new family name, Yumi Matsutoya. In 1978, her memorable first album as Yumi Matsutoya, entitled ''Benisuzume'' was released. In the late 1970s and early 80s, she released two albums every year. However, those albums were less successful than the ones she released when she was single. Nevertheless, she wrote several of her well-known songs during those years, and her albums reached the top 10 on the Oricon chart.\n\nBefore the release of ''Benisuzume'', a compilation named ''Album'' was released by Toshiba EMI. It mainly contained songs she had released as Yumi Arai, and two songs released as singles only. Matsutoya didn't want to release this compilation; in her autobiography released in 1982, she writes about this album and calls it \"The biggest stain on my music career.\"<ref name=\"b\">''Rouge no Dengon'', Yumi Matsutoya, Kadokawa Shoten Publishing Co., Ltd., {{ISBN|978-4-04-158001-1}}</ref> Because of this, she never allowed the release of another compilation album until 1998. However, her ex-record-label Alfa Records had released many compilations which consisted of her old tunes without her permission. Hence, in the late 1990s, she bought the copyrights of all her songs that she had written under her maiden name.\n\nHer tenth album, ''Surf and Snow'' (1980), changed the negative tide for her. When the album was released, it did not sell as well as others had previously. However, in 1986, \"Koibito ga Santa Claus\" became popular as the theme song for the hit movie ''Watashi wo Ski ni Tsuretette''. The album eventually sold over 400,000 copies. In 1987, she returned to the top of Japanese pop music. Her husband wrote the score for the movie ''Nerawareta Gakuen'', which was directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi and distributed by Kadokawa Pictures. She wrote \"Mamotte Agetai\" as the theme song for the movie. The single of this song reached number two on Oricon and sold nearly 700,000 copies. Following the success of the single, her eleventh album ''Sakuban Oaishimasho'' (1981) became her second number one album. From that year through 1997, 17 consecutive studio albums she released reached number one on the Oricon charts.\n\nIn 1982, she published an autobiography, ''Rouge no Dengon''. In this book, she wrote about her life in an exaggerated style. She contemplated doing the artwork on her own albums. The artwork of the album ''Sakuban Oaishimasho'' (1981) was designed by [[Hipgnosis]], and the video ''Compartment'' was produced by [[Storm Thorgerson]], [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]] and [[Peter Christopherson]]. A logo design from the latter film also became the logo of \"Yuming\", and was used as the cover of the 1984 album ''No Side''. [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]] and [[Richard Evans (designer)|Richard Evans]] of [[Hipgnosis]] also designed the cover of the 1983 album \"Voyager\". Since the 1970s, she has also been famous as an artist who performs in concerts using gorgeous and novel sets. She used elaborate visual technology on the stage and it is said that they cost over a hundred million yen. She has released two live albums and several videos. In 1986, she released her first live album, ''Yuming Visualive DA-DI-DA,''. It was released on CD and cassette tape only, and it became one of the rarest items among her fans for many years.\n\n====Commercial peak and decline====\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, her albums consisted of mechanical sounds which featured [[synclavier]]. In addition, they were recorded by a lot of famous West Coast musicians. However, in later years, Masataka Matsutoya, her record producer and husband, regretted the cheap rhythm section on those albums. ''Before the Diamond Dust Fades....'' (1987) sold more than any of her albums at that time. In the late 1980s, her record sales increased. ''Delight Slight Light KISS'' (1988) became the first million-selling record for her. From this album in 1995 to the album ''Kathmandu'', she released eight studio albums and all of them sold over million copies. Above all, two of those albums, ''The Gates of Heaven'' (1990), and ''The Dancing Sun'' (1994), sold over double-million copies. The former is the first double million-selling album in Japan. ''Dawn Purple'' (1991) sold over a million copies in one week after the album's release. Her record sales were appraised by the Japanese music industry. ''Before the Diamond Dust Fades...'' won [[Japan Record Award]]s of 1988 and ''The Gates of Heaven'' won a Japanese gold disc grand prix of 1991.\n\n''The Gates of Heaven'' and several of her albums in those years reflected an optimistic atmosphere in Japan caused by the [[Japanese asset price bubble|asset price bubble]] around the end of the 1980s and early 1990s. She was often called \"Charisma of Youth\" or \"The Enthusiastic Leader of Love\" in those days. After hearing from her record company [[EMI Music Japan|Toshiba-EMI]] that single sales were quickly overtaking album sales due to a slowing economy, Matsutoya decided to make a difference. To make people buy the album, she did not release any physical singles at all for about four years in the early 1990s, although she did promote songs from her albums to radio as \"album cuts\". Her albums ''The Gates of Heaven'' (1990), ''Dawn Purple'' (1991) and ''Tears And Reasons'' (1992) performed very well on the [[Oricon]] charts, boosted partially by airplay. However, in autumn 1993, she released \"Manatsu no Yo no Yume\", the first physical single in four years since \"Anniversary\", already known as the theme song of the TV drama ''Dare nimo Ienai''. It sold over 1,400,000 copies and became the 89th best-selling single in Japan. It is her most successful single.\n\nThe next year, she produced the two-million-selling singles called \"Hello,My Friend\" and \"Haru-yo, Koi\". Both of these singles were used in TV dramas (the former was featured on ''Kimi to Ita Natsu'', the latter was used on the same titled program broadcast by [[NHK]]). The latter in particular is famous as one of her standard numbers. Those songs were also included on the album ''The Dancing Sun'', which became her second double million-selling album on the strength of those popular tunes. That same year, the equity ratio of her record company (which was originally established by [[Toshiba|Toshiba Corporation]] in 1960 as '''Toshiba Musical Industries''', and then renamed '''Toshiba-EMI''' when Toshiba sold 50% of the company to the British [[EMI|EMI Group]] in 1973) was changed, with EMI now owning a 55% stake in the company, while Toshiba owned the remaining 45% stake in the company.\n \nShe was interested in the [[Spirit|spiritual world]] for many years, and this preference was often represented in her songs, a tendency that became deeper in the 1990s.\n\nIn August 1996, about twenty years after her marriage, Yumi Matsutoya came back as Yumi Arai and performed three days at Nakano Sunplaza, Tokyo. Excerpts of that live recording were released on video and CD. A month before the live performances, a newly recorded version of her early standard song, \"Machibuse\" (she did not sing it herself), was released as a single. Until 1995, she had released studio albums every year, but her popularity began to decline around 1996. After her twenty-ninth studio album, ''The Waves of Zuvuya'', (1997) her record sale declined more and more.\n\nAs \"Yumi Matsutoya\", she had not released any compilation albums since 1977. Formerly, she didn't want to release compilation albums. However, in 1998, she released a double album compilation, ''Neue Musik: Yumi Matsutoya Complete Best Vol. 1''. It included 28 songs and two new songs recorded with the former members of Tin-Pan-Alley. In addition, several songs of this album were selected by votes by her fans. At this stage, it is her biggest-selling and final four million-selling album.\n\n====Recent years====\nAfter the release of her well-sold compilation album, she declared that she would make the music she wants to. From 1999 on, she has released eight studio albums.\n\nOn June 30, 2007, [[Toshiba|Toshiba Corporation]] sold its remaining 45% stake in Matsutoya's record label to [[EMI]] and gave EMI full ownership of the company.

Some of them became big hits, such as \"Ichigo Hakusho o Mou Ichido\" (Performed by Banban, 1975) and \"Machibuse\" (Performed by Seiko Miki, Hitomi Ishikawa, originally released in 1975). Many of her hit tunes were sung by idol singer [[Seiko Matsuda]]. Several songs sung by Matsuda reached number one on the Oricon singles chart, including \"Akai Sweet Pea\", \"Nagisa no Balcony\" (1982) and \"Hitomi wa Diamond\" (1986). These singles are some of Matsuda's best-known songs. Matsutoya has collaborated with many songwriters and lyricists, among them [[Yosui Inoue]], [[Takashi Matsumoto (lyricist)|Takashi Matsumoto]], [[K\u014dki Mitani]], [[Kunihiko Kase]], [[Shizuka Ijuin]]. She also co-wrote the Japanese lyrics to the [[Lynsey de Paul]] and [[Barry Blue]] penned song [[Sugar Shuffle]] with Asami Kobayashi, which appeared on Kobayashi's Cryptograph album in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Asami-Kobayashi-\u5c0f\u6797\u9ebb\u7f8e-Cryptograph-\u611b\u306e\u6697\u53f7/release/8338432|title=Asami Kobayashi = \u5c0f\u6797\u9ebb\u7f8e* \u2013 Cryptograph = \u611b\u306e\u6697\u53f7|publisher=discogs|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}</ref> When she writes songs for other musicians, she often uses the pseudonym {{nihongo|''Kureta Karuho''|\u5449\u7530\u8efd\u7a42}}. It is a parody on the name of [[Greta Garbo]].\n\n===Collaboration with other artists===\nOn her early albums, several famous 1970s Japanese singer-songwriters who had not yet succeeded at that time sang as the backing vocalists; [[Tatsuro Yamashita]], [[Taeko Onuki]], [[Akiko Yano]] and [[Minako Yoshida]]. Yamashita usually arranged the chorus parts of her songs in the '70s. But in later years, he criticized her late 1980s music career in his own song called \"Queen of Hype Blues\". In her career spanning more than 30 years, Matsutoya has sung duets with many singers; including Takao Kisugi, [[Toshinobu Kubota]], [[Masumi Okada]], and [[Original Love (Japanese musician)|Takao Tajima]].\n\nShe has also recorded several collaboration singles with other musicians. In 1985, she released the song \"Imadakara\" with [[Kazumasa Oda]] and Kazuo Zaitsu. It was mostly composed by Oda and Matsutoya, arranged by [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and played by former [[Sadistic Mika Band]] members. At the live event performed in June the same year, having added Matsutoya as vocalist, the band reunited as \"Sadistic Yuming Band\" and performed this song.\n\nIn 1986, Matsutoya  co-wrote \"Kissin' Christmas\", a theme song for a TV program, with [[Keisuke Kuwata]], the leader of [[Southern All Stars]]. Appearing only on TV, this song was a collaboration by two of the most successful Japanese songwriters. However, the song has never been released on any format.\n\nIn 1992, Matsutoya and [[Tatsuya Ishii|Karl Smokey Ishii]] cooperated for the single \"Ai no Wave\". She wrote it and the B-Side \"Roman no Dengon\" with him. The same year, Ishii had released \"Kimi ga Irudake de\", the fifth best-selling single in Japan. Therefore, the single climbed to the top of the hit parade naturally. The title of \"Roman no Gengon\" was self-parody of their songs; it was named under Matsutoya's \"Rouge no Dengon\" and Kome Kome Club's \"Roman Hikou\".\n\nWhen her popularity quickly declined at the end of the 1990s, she recorded a song with the popular group [[Pocket Biscuits]]. They collaborated on the single \"Millennium\" in 2000, but it did not achieve the expected success.\n\nIn 2002, she penned the song \"Koi no Signal\" for the group Coming Century, a sub-unit of the popular boyband [[V6 (band)|V6]]. Compared to other Coming Century songs of the time, the lyrics for the song were more heartfelt and optimistic.\n\nIn 2005, Matsutoya formed the group called \"Yumi Matsutoya and Friends of Love the Earth\" with four East Asian artists; [[Dick Lee]] from Singapore, [[Lim Hyung Joo]] from [[South Korea]], [[Amin (Chinese singer)|amin]] and Xu Ke from China. \nMatsutoya wrote the song \"Smile Again\" for the new group, and it was released on iTMS only. When Matsutoya appeared at the [[Expo 2005]] concert in September of the same year, they appeared as guests and sang this song. On New Year's Eve the same year, they appeared in the Japanese traditional annual TV music program ''[[Kohaku Uta Gassen]]'', and performed \"Smile Again\". The next year, Matsutoya re-recorded the song and released it on her album ''A Girl in Summer''. In autumn of 2006, this unit added more members. They had only one concert and released the new single \"Knockin' at the Door\" on CD.\n\nIn 2006, she wrote a song \"Still Crazy for You\" for [[Crazy Cats]], a Japanese comedy team popular in the late 1950s and 1960s, and sung a duet with the vocalist [[Kei Tani]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zakzak.co.jp/gei/2006_04/g2006041212.html |title=ZAKZAK |publisher=ZAKZAK |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522225752/http://www.zakzak.co.jp/gei/2006_04/g2006041212.html |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was released as the group's first new single since 1986, and climbed to No. 14 on the Oricon chart.

She sang a duet with [[Gary Brooker]] on this new version of the 1967 classic, which featured three verses and a guitar solo by [[Geoff Whitehorn]].  Yumi and Procol Harum then played a series of December concerts in major Japanese cities, one of which was recorded for a later television showing.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Yumi Matsutoya discography}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''Hik\u014dki-gumo'' (1973) <small>(credited to \"Yumi Arai\")</small>\n* ''MISSLIM'' (1974) <small>(credited to \"Yumi Arai\")</small>\n* ''[[Cobalt Hour]]'' (1975) <small>(credited to \"Yumi Arai\")</small>\n* ''14-banme no Tsuki (The 14th Moon)'' (1976) <small>(credited to \"Yumi Arai\")</small>\n* ''Benisuzume'' (1978)\n* ''Ry\u016bsenkei '80'' (1978)\n* ''OLIVE'' (1979)\n* ''Kanashii hodo Otenki(The Gallery in My Heart )'' (1979)\n* ''[[Toki no Nai Hotel]]'' (1980)\n* ''Surf and Snow Volume One'' (1980)\n* ''Mizu no Naka no ASIA e'' (1981)\n* ''Sakuban Oaishimash\u014d'' (1981)\n* ''PEARL PIERCE'' (1982)\n* ''REINCARNATION'' (1983)\n* ''VOYAGER'' (1983)\n* ''NO SIDE'' (1984)\n* ''DA-DI-DA'' (1985)\n* ''ALARM \u00e0 la mode'' (1986)\n* ''Diamond Dust ga Kienumani(Before the DIAMOND DUST fades... )'' (1987)\n* ''DELIGHT SLIGHT LIGHT KISS'' (1988)\n* ''Love Wars'' (1989)\n* ''Tengoku no Door (The Gates of Heaven)'' (1990)\n* ''Dawn Purple'' (1991)\n* ''Tears and Reasons'' (1992)\n* ''U-miz'' (1993)\n* ''The Dancing Sun'' (1994)\n* ''Kathmandu'' (1995)\n* ''Cowgirl Dreamin' '' (1997)\n* ''Suyua no Nami (The Wave of Zuvuya)'' (1997)\n* ''Frozen Roses'' (1999)\n* ''Acacia'' (2001)\n* ''Wings of Winter, Shades of Summer '' (2002)\n* ''Yuming Compositions:FACES'' (2003)\n* ''VIVA! 6\u00d77'' (2004)\n* ''A Girl in Summer'' (2006)\n*''Soshite Mouichido Yumemiru Darou (And I Will Dream Again\u2026)''(2009)\n*''Road Show'' (2011)\n*''POP CLASSICO'' (2013)\n*''Uch\u016b Toshokan (Universal Library)'' (2016)\n\n==Reception==\nIn a 2006 survey of people between 10 and 49 years of age in Japan, [[Oricon|Oricon Style]] found the number one selling song \"Valentine's Radio\" (1,606,780 copies) to be the third most popular Valentine's Day song in Japan.

However, the province has become much less isolated in recent years, with the upgrading of a major road up from the Mekong valley city of [[Pakse]], plus two major road projects connecting Sekong to Vietnam to the east. Road infrastructure backed by the Vietnamese is part of a regional development strategy spearheaded by Hanoi called the Development Triangle Initiative, aiming to develop links between Vietnam and neighboring underdeveloped provinces in Cambodia and Laos.\n\n==Protected areas==\nThe [[Dakchung Plateau]] is an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA).

But small paths provide approaches from the main road to villages located on the northern part of the NBCA. The southeastern part of NBCA is difficult to reach. However, the [[Kong River]] (or Xe Kong, or Sekong) and its two tributaries Xe Sap and Xe Lon provide access to the reserve by boats. The reserve has many water falls, rocky cliffs and [[rhododendrons]] at higher elevations. There are 43 mammals (including 18 key species), 178 birds (18 are key species), 48 reptiles and 33 amphibians; the notable species of wildlife are two species of [[bear]]s, [[serow]], large antlered [[muntjac]], large number of [[gaur]]s and tigers.

Only about 3% of the population is ethnic Lao. The vast majority (97%) come from one of at least 14 distinct ethnic minority groups.  The [[Alak people|Alak]] (21% of the provincial population), [[Katu people|Katu]] (20%), [[Tarieng]] (19%) and Nge/Krieng (11%) are the main ethnic groups.  The Lao government classifies them as \u201c[[Lao Theung]]\u201d (mid-slope Lao), but an ethno-linguistic categorization, based on [[language families]], places them under the Austroasiatic family.  Within this broad family, the ethnic groups of Sekong fall into two linguistic branches: the [[Katuic]] (including the Katu and the Nge/Krieng) and the Bahnaric (Alak and Tarieng). Approximately 14,700 Katu live in the province.{{sfn|Tagwerker|2009|p=73}}\n\n==Economy==\nSekong Province is one of the poorest provinces in Laos, second to only Houphanh Province.

Much of the natural forest in Sekong has never been subject to commercial logging, but this is changing fast. Commercial timber extraction has been expanding rapidly over the past decade in the province. There is tremendous and growing pressure on Sekong to log its forests \u2013 both from Vietnamese interests (where the wood furniture sector averaged 70% growth per year during 2000\u20132004) and from Lao companies (who face wood shortages because of dwindling stocks in lowland forests).\n{{sfn|Wittmer|Gundimeda|2012|p=69}} The economic return from the forest resources of the province, as of 2003, was estimated to be in the range of US$398 to 525 per household, and more than the agricultural income. The revenue to the state from sale of timber was also very substantial, estimated to be US$10.35 per ha. The natural forests in the province are also helpful in carbon sequestration benefits estimated to be US$124 per ha and also in watershed improvements, by way of avoiding erosion and reducing flood incidence.<ref name=\"Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR\">{{cite book|title=Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwUkX-QRrR0C&pg=PA33|accessdate=10 December 2012|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-955-8177-47-1|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\nCorruption of the provincial level authorities in Sekong province is a problem, and they have reportedly \"actively undermined a successful donor-funded village participatory sustainable forest management initiative.\"{{sfn|Snelder|Lasco|2008|p=266}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Laos Lawae082122a.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Laos Katoo081999a.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Bru and Katu locals of Sekong Province wearing stripped line clothing.\n}}\nThe cultural values in the province relate to: The indigenous Lao Teung culture with spiritual links to the land, five different \"[[Lao Teung]]\" languages with one becoming extinct, several funeral and sacred forests, [[Indochina War]] relics, and a stretch of the [[Ho Chi Min Trail]].<ref name=Sap/> [broken link] To ward off falling bombs during the Indochina War, some [[Animism|animist]] tribal people placed [[talisman]] above their huts.{{sfn|Rough Guides|2011|p=257}} Weaving activity in Sekong City has unique textile designs (in mulicoloured lines) and is aided by a back-tensioned loom called the \"[[hip loom]]\".

However, the [[Kong River]] (or Xe Kong, or Sekong) and its two tributaries Xe Sap and Xe Lon provide access to the reserve by boats. The reserve has many water falls, rocky cliffs and [[rhododendrons]] at higher elevations. There are 43 mammals (including 18 key species), 178 birds (18 are key species), 48 reptiles and 33 amphibians; the notable species of wildlife are two species of [[bear]]s, [[serow]], large antlered [[muntjac]], large number of [[gaur]]s and tigers.

The Lao government classifies them as \u201c[[Lao Theung]]\u201d (mid-slope Lao), but an ethno-linguistic categorization, based on [[language families]], places them under the Austroasiatic family.  Within this broad family, the ethnic groups of Sekong fall into two linguistic branches: the [[Katuic]] (including the Katu and the Nge/Krieng) and the Bahnaric (Alak and Tarieng). Approximately 14,700 Katu live in the province.{{sfn|Tagwerker|2009|p=73}}\n\n==Economy==\nSekong Province is one of the poorest provinces in Laos, second to only Houphanh Province.

Much of the natural forest in Sekong has never been subject to commercial logging, but this is changing fast. Commercial timber extraction has been expanding rapidly over the past decade in the province. There is tremendous and growing pressure on Sekong to log its forests \u2013 both from Vietnamese interests (where the wood furniture sector averaged 70% growth per year during 2000\u20132004) and from Lao companies (who face wood shortages because of dwindling stocks in lowland forests).\n{{sfn|Wittmer|Gundimeda|2012|p=69}} The economic return from the forest resources of the province, as of 2003, was estimated to be in the range of US$398 to 525 per household, and more than the agricultural income. The revenue to the state from sale of timber was also very substantial, estimated to be US$10.35 per ha. The natural forests in the province are also helpful in carbon sequestration benefits estimated to be US$124 per ha and also in watershed improvements, by way of avoiding erosion and reducing flood incidence.<ref name=\"Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR\">{{cite book|title=Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwUkX-QRrR0C&pg=PA33|accessdate=10 December 2012|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-955-8177-47-1|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\nCorruption of the provincial level authorities in Sekong province is a problem, and they have reportedly \"actively undermined a successful donor-funded village participatory sustainable forest management initiative.\"{{sfn|Snelder|Lasco|2008|p=266}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Laos Lawae082122a.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Laos Katoo081999a.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Bru and Katu locals of Sekong Province wearing stripped line clothing.\n}}\nThe cultural values in the province relate to: The indigenous Lao Teung culture with spiritual links to the land, five different \"[[Lao Teung]]\" languages with one becoming extinct, several funeral and sacred forests, [[Indochina War]] relics, and a stretch of the [[Ho Chi Min Trail]].<ref name=Sap/> [broken link] To ward off falling bombs during the Indochina War, some [[Animism|animist]] tribal people placed [[talisman]] above their huts.{{sfn|Rough Guides|2011|p=257}} Weaving activity in Sekong City has unique textile designs (in mulicoloured lines) and is aided by a back-tensioned loom called the \"[[hip loom]]\".
