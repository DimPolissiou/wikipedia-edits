The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]'', and most recently in a [[BBC]] podcast ''13 Minutes to the Moon'' (2020).<ref>[www.bbcworldservice.com/13 minutes BBC World Service, 13 Minustes to the Moon] access April 13, 2020</ref>\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F.

Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces.

One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R.

The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]'', and most recently in a [[BBC]] podcast ''13 Minutes to the Moon'' (2020).<ref>[www.bbcworldservice.com/13 minutes BBC World Service, 13 Minustes to the Moon] access 13 April 2020</ref>\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F.

Each member of the prime crew spent over 400 hours in simulators of the CM and (for Lovell and Haise) of the LM at KSC and at Houston, some of which involved the flight controllers at Mission Control.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}} Flight controllers participated in many simulations of problems with the spacecraft in flight, which taught them how to react in an emergency.<ref name = \"Cass 1\" />  Specialized simulators at other locations were also used by the crew members.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}}\n\nThe astronauts of Apollo 11 had minimal time for geology training, with only six months between crew assignment and launch; higher priorities took much of their time.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=100}} Apollo 12 saw more such training, including practice in the field, using a CAPCOM and a simulated backroom of scientists, to whom the astronauts had to describe what they saw.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=103\u2013104}} Scientist-astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] saw that there was limited enthusiasm for geology field trips. Believing an inspirational teacher was needed, Schmitt arranged for Lovell and Haise to meet his old professor, [[Caltech]]'s [[Leon Silver|Lee Silver]]. The two astronauts, and backups Young and Duke, went on a field trip with Silver at their own time and expense. At the end of their week together, Lovell made Silver their geology mentor, who would be extensively involved in the geology planning for Apollo&nbsp;13.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=107\u2013111}} [[Farouk El-Baz]] oversaw the training of Mattingly and his backup, Swigert, which involved describing and photographing simulated lunar landmarks from airplanes.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=134}} El-Baz had all three prime crew astronauts describe geologic features they saw during their flights between Houston and KSC; Mattingly's enthusiasm caused other astronauts, such as Apollo 14's CMP, Roosa, to seek out El-Baz as a teacher.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\nConcerned about how close Apollo 11's LM, ''Eagle'', had come to running out of propellant during its lunar descent, mission planners decided that beginning with Apollo&nbsp;13, the CSM would bring the LM to the low orbit from which the landing attempt would commence. This was a change from Apollo 11 and 12, on which the LM made the burn to bring it to the lower orbit. The change was part of an effort to increase the amount of hover time available to the astronauts as the missions headed into rougher terrain.{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=53}}\n\nThe plan was to devote the first of the two four-hour lunar surface [[extravehicular activity|extravehicular activities]] (EVAs) to setting up the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP) group of scientific instruments; during the second, Lovell and Haise would investigate Cone crater, near the planned landing site.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=363}} The two astronauts wore their spacesuits for some 20 walk-throughs of EVA procedures, including sample gathering and use of tools and other equipment. They flew in the \"[[Vomit Comet]]\" in simulated microgravity or lunar gravity, including practice in donning and doffing spacesuits. To prepare for the descent to the Moon's surface, Lovell flew the [[Lunar Landing Training Vehicle]] (LLTV).{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=105}} Despite the fact that four of the five LLTVs and similar Lunar Landing Research Vehicles crashed during the course of the Apollo program, mission commanders considered flying them invaluable experience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Eric M.|title=Lunar Landing Training Vehicle NASA 952|date=April 29, 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2019|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/LLTV-952.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|work=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal}}</ref>\n\n== Experiments and scientific objectives ==\n[[File:Lovell and Haise geology training (S70-20253).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lovell (left) and Haise during geology training in Hawaii, January 1970]]\n\nApollo&nbsp;13's designated landing site was near [[Fra Mauro (crater)|Fra Mauro crater]]; the [[Fra Mauro formation]] was believed to contain much material spattered by the impact that had filled the [[Imbrium basin]] early in the Moon's history.

Swigert initially thought that a [[meteoroid]] might have struck the LM, but he and Lovell quickly realized there was no leak.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=293}} The Main Bus&nbsp;B undervolt meant that there was insufficient voltage flowing from the SM's three power cells (fueled by hydrogen and oxygen piped from their respective tanks) to the second of the SM's two electric power distribution systems. Almost everything in the CSM required power. Although the bus momentarily returned to normal status, soon both buses A and B were short on voltage.

A \"direct abort\" would use the SM's main engine (the [[Service Propulsion System]] or SPS) to return before reaching the Moon. But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces.

One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R.

The resulting fire quickly increased pressure inside the tank and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (SM Sector{{nbsp}}4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. The escaping gas was probably enough by itself to blow out the aluminum exterior panel to Sector{{nbsp}}4, but combustion products generated as nearby insulation ignited would have added to the pressure. The panel's departure exposed the sector to space, snuffing out the fire, and it probably hit the nearby high-gain antenna, disrupting communications to Earth for 1.8&nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=372\u2013373}} The sectors of the SM were not airtight from each other, and had there been time for the entire SM to become as pressurized as Sector{{nbsp}}4, the force on the CM's heat shield would have separated the two modules.

Nonetheless, the switches Beech used were not rated for 65 volts.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=374}}\n\nAt NAR's facility, Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 had been originally installed in an oxygen shelf placed in the [[Apollo 10]] service module, SM-106, but which was removed to fix a potential [[electromagnetic interference]] problem and another shelf substituted. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}\n\nThe [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970. During the test, the cryogenic tanks were filled, but Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 could not be emptied through the normal drain line, and a report was written documenting the problem. After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen. The thermostatic switches were designed to prevent the heaters from raising the temperature higher than {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, but they failed under the 65-volt power supply applied. Temperatures on the heater tube within the tank may have reached {{convert|1,000|F|C|order=flip|-1}}, most likely damaging the Teflon insulation.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-23}} The temperature gauge was not designed to read higher than {{convert|85|F|C|order=flip}}, so the technician monitoring the procedure detected nothing unusual.

This required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full.{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=281}} The third tank was placed in Bay{{nbsp}}1 of the SM, on the side opposite the other two, and was given an isolation valve that could isolate it from the fuel cells and from the other two oxygen tanks in an emergency, and allow it to feed the CM's environmental system only.

Episode 6, \"Earth in view\" is the penultimate episode examines how the astronauts navigated the space craft as it approached earth As of 13 April 2020, the final episode has been delayed due to the cornonavirus pandemic. In \"Delay to Episode 7\", the BBC explains that there will be a delay in the final episode since the presenter of the series, Kevin Fong, a medical doctor, has been called into service.<ref>[www.bbcworldservice.com/13 minutes BBC 13 Minutes to the moon] accessed 13 April 2020.</ref>    \n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\n\nFile:ALSEP Ap13-70-HC-77.jpg|Lovell practices deploying the [[ALSEP]] during training\nFile:Apollo 13 Saturn V during rollout.jpg|The Apollo 13 launch vehicle being rolled out, December 1969\nFile:Apollo 13 Mailbox at Mission Control.jpg|The \"mailbox\" at [[Mission Control#NASA Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] during the Apollo&nbsp;13 mission\nFile:Apollo 13 LM undocking (AS13-59-8566) (cropped).jpg|Lunar module ''Aquarius'' after it was jettisoned above the Earth\nFile:Mission Control Celebrates - GPN-2000-001313.jpg|Mission Control celebrates the successful splashdown\nFile:Apollo 13 Astronauts on the U.S.S.

The top five emitters ([[PRC|China]], the United States, India, Russia, and Japan), who together emit half the world's greenhouse gases, vary in both awareness and concern. The United States, Russia, and Japan are the most aware at over 85% of the population. Conversely, only two-thirds of people in China and one-third in India are aware. Japan expresses the greatest concern, which translates into support for environmental policies.

The report identifies six audiences with different opinions about global warming: The alarmed (18%), the concerned (33%), the cautious (19%), the disengaged (12%), the doubtful (11%) and the dismissive (7%).

It was developed by [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] in response to [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] issued by the [[Air Ministry]] for a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] jet-powered bomber. The Valiant was the first of the V bombers to become operational, and was followed by the [[Handley Page Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan]], which were more advanced. The Valiant has the distinction of being the only V bomber to have dropped live nuclear weapons.<ref name = \"black wright 33\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 33.</ref>\n\nThe Valiant was intended as a high-altitude [[strategic bomber]]. During the late 1950s, in response to rapid advances in [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) technology, the Valiant fleet was switched to flying low-level for the strike role. Beyond the [[nuclear deterrence]] role, the Valiant was also used by the RAF for other purposes, as a number were converted to perform support roles such as [[aerial refuelling]] tankers and [[aerial reconnaissance]] aircraft. Valiants were used for conventional bombing missions over [[Egypt]] for [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956.\n\nBy late 1964 it was found that all variants of the Valiant showed premature fatigue and inter-crystalline corrosion in wing spar attachment forgings, traced to the use of a poorly understood aluminium alloy, DTD683.<ref>\u201cPitfalls of the substitution of sophistication for Common Sense\u201d  D Howe, Cranfield University. IMechE Vol 212 Part G, Sec 5.1 Metals, p. 307. May 1998</ref>{{#tag:ref|The rapid development of aircraft during World War II led to a demand for very high strength aluminium alloy, especially for use in highly loaded tension and compression members. One result was a zinc /magnesium based alloy given the identification DTD 683. It was ideal for such applications as wing spar caps providing, as was the case with wartime operations, the life of the aircraft was short. Use in early post-War transport aircraft showed that DTD 683 was very crack-sensitive and hence prone to fatigue failure. In many cases it had to be replaced by steel components. DTD 683 is an example of a material developed to meet a particular need, but whose wider characteristics were not investigated until too late.\nD.Howe 1998|group=N}} Rather than proceeding with an expensive rebuilding program, the Ministry of Defence retired the Valiant in 1965. Its duties were continued by the other V-bombers which remained in service until the 1980s.\n\n==Development==\n===Background and origins===\nIn November 1944, the Joint Technical Warfare  Committee, along with a separate committee chaired by Sir [[Henry Tizard]], examined the future potential  of \"weapons of war\" and the accompanying Tizard Report published on 3 July 1945 made specific policy directions for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]].<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\">Turpin 2002, p. 71.</ref> After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the policy of using heavy four-engined bombers for massed raids continued into the immediate postwar period; the [[Avro Lincoln]], an updated version of the [[Avro Lancaster]], became the RAF's standard bomber.<ref>McLelland 2013, p. 18.</ref> In 1946, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued Operational Requirements OR229 and OR230 for the development of [[jet aircraft|turbojet]]-powered heavy bombers capable of carrying [[nuclear weapon]]s at high altitude and speed, without defensive armament, to act as a deterrent to hostile powers and, if deterrence failed, to perform a nuclear strike.<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\"/> In conjunction with this ambition, Britain set about developing its own [[nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|atomic weapons]].<ref name = \"flint 131\"/>\n\nIn January 1947, the British [[Air Ministry]] issued [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] for an advanced jet bomber intended to carry nuclear weapons and to fly near the speed of sound at altitudes of {{cvt|50000|ft|m}}.<ref name = 'Rose 52'/> Three firms: [[Avro|A.V. Roe]], [[Handley-Page Aircraft Company|Handley-Page]] and [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] submitted advanced designs intended to meet the stringent requirements.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p397\">Burnet and Morgan  ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 397.</ref> While [[Short Brothers]] submitted a design, by [[Geoffrey T. R.

Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist described Specification B.14/46 as \"calling for little more than a traditional aircraft fitted with jet engines\"<ref name = \"bomber 72\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 72.</ref> Short submitted a conservative design to meet B.14/46, which became the [[Short Sperrin|S.A.4 Sperrin]].<ref name = 'Rose 52'/> Two prototypes were completed, the first conducting its [[maiden flight]] in 1951, but the Sperrin was ultimately relegated to research and development purposes only.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p397\"/><ref name = \"flint 131\"/>\n\nVickers had emerged from the Second World War as one of the world's pre-eminent companies in the field of aeronautical manufacturing and development. Furthermore, the company operated its own secretive [[Skunk Works]]-like development organisation based at Weybridge, Surrey, which had been involved in several secret wartime development projects. It was this secretive division in which the early stages of the development of the Valiant took place, including the later assembly of the initial two prototypes.<ref name = \"bomber 72 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> Vickers initially produced a six-engine jet bomber design proposal to meet Specification B.35/46; as rapid progress in the development of more powerful jet engines had been made, this was re-worked to a four-engine proposal in 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 73.</ref> The proposed design submitted by Vickers was relatively straightforward, being less aerodynamically advanced in comparison to competing bids made by rival firms.<ref name = \"bomber 72\"/><ref name = \"black wright 17\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 17.</ref>\n\nBoth Handley-Page and Avro had produced advanced designs for the bomber competition. These would be produced as the [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] respectively; the Air Staff decided to award contracts to each company as a form of insurance in case one of these designs failed. The submissions became known as the [[V bomber]]s, or V-class, with the aircraft all being given names that started with the letter \"V\".<ref>Downey 1985, p. 5.</ref> Vickers' submission had initially been rejected as not being as advanced as the Victor and the Vulcan,<ref name = 'Rose 52'>Rosemeyer 2009, p. 52.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> but Vickers' chief designer [[George Edwards (aviation)|George Edwards]] lobbied the Air Ministry on the basis that it would be available much sooner than the competition, going so far as to promise that a flight-capable prototype would be flown by the end of 1951, that subsequent production aircraft would be flown prior to the end of 1953, and that serial deliveries would commence during early 1955. Gunston and Gilchrist observe that measures offered by Edwards were a \"gigantic risk\", and that gaining the bomber contract has been deemed of crucial importance to the future of aircraft manufacturing at Vickers.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/>\n\nAlthough developing and operating three overlapping large aircraft in response to a single Operational Requirement (OR) was wasteful and very costly, events such as the [[Berlin Blockade]] had led to officials placing a sense of urgency in the necessity to provide an effective deterrent to the Soviet Union from acts of aggression in Europe.<ref>Rosemeyer 2009, pp. 52\u201353.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> In April 1948, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued a specification with the designation B.9/48 written around the Vickers design, which was given the company designation of Type 660; an 'Instruction to Proceed' was received by Vickers on 16 April 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/> In February 1949, two prototypes of the aircraft were ordered. The first of these was to be fitted with four [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Avon|RA.3 Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines, while the second was to be fitted with four [[Armstrong Siddeley]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire|Sapphire]] engines as the Type 667.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p438\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 438.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:Vickers Valiant Farnborough 1951.jpg|thumb|First prototype performing a flight display at [[Farnborough Airshow]], 1951]]\nOn 18 May 1951, the first prototype, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] WB210 took to the air for its [[maiden flight]],<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p439\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 439.</ref> within the deadline that George Edwards had promised, and preceding the first [[Short Sperrin]] into the air by several months, it being only 27 months since the contract had been issued. The pilot was [[Joseph Summers|Captain Joseph \"Mutt\" Summers]], who had also been the original test pilot on the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], and wanted to add another \"first\" to his record before he retired. His co-pilot on the first flight was Gabe \"Jock\" Bryce, who succeeded Summers as Vickers' chief test pilot upon his retirement shortly afterwards.<ref name=\"Turpin p. 72\">Turpin 2002, p. 72.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 10\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 10.</ref><ref>McLelland 2013, p. 68.</ref> The next month, the Vickers Type 660 was given the official name of \"Valiant\", recycling the name given to the [[Vickers 131 Valiant|Vickers Type 131]] general-purpose biplane of 1931.{{#tag:ref|Traditionally, RAF bombers had been named after towns and cities, for example Lancaster, [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax]] and [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]], but the new aircraft technology seemed to suggest a break from tradition; the name also fitted in with an equally long held tradition of alliteration in aircraft names.|group=N}} The name Valiant had been selected by a survey of Vickers employees.<ref name=\"Jones p31,3\">Jones 2007, pp. 31, 33.</ref>\n\nOn 11 January 1952, the first Valiant prototype was lost while making internal noise measurements for the V.1000 programme. Testing included engine shutdowns and re-lights,<ref>The Vickers Valiant, C F Andrews, Profile Publications Ltd., P O Box 26, Leatherhead, p.4</ref> one of which caused a fire in the starboard wing; most of the crew managed to escape the aircraft safely, except for the co-pilot, who struck the tail after ejecting.<ref name=\"Flight p13\">''Flight'' 4 July 1958, p. 13.</ref><ref>Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 11\u201316.</ref>  After modifications to the fuel system the second prototype, serial number WB215, the Vickers Type 667, conducted its maiden flight on 11 April 1952.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p440\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 440.</ref> It was fitted with more powerful RA.7 Avon engines with {{convert|7500|lbf|kN}} thrust each, rather than the Sapphires that had been originally planned; it also featured more rounded [[Components of jet engines#Air intakes|air inlet]]s, replacing the narrow slot-type intakes of the first prototype, in order to feed sufficient air to the more powerful engines. The short delay until the second prototype became available for testing, which was accelerated by three months, meant that loss of the initial prototype did not seriously compromise the schedule.<ref name=\"Turpin p74\">Turpin 2002, p. 74.</ref><ref name=\"Jones p34\">Jones 2007, p. 34.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 17\"/>\n\nOf the three prototypes, two were representative of the Valiant B.1,<ref name=\"Jones p26\">Jones 2007, p. 26.</ref> while one was built as a further developed version, referred to as the Valiant B.2. The B.2 variant was intended to serve as a [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinder]] aircraft, flying at high speed at low level to mark targets for the main bomber force. To cope with the rougher ride compared with high altitude operations, the B.2 had a strengthened airframe. In particular, the wing received design alterations to strengthen it, a key change being the removal of the large cut-outs in the wing structure into which the main wheels retracted, allowing the wing torsion box structure to be uninterrupted and giving more room for internal fuel storage; instead the main landing gear, which had four wheels instead of the two large wheels of the B.1, retracted backwards into large [[Aircraft fairing|fairing]]s set into the rear of the wings.<ref name = \"bomber 77 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 77\u201378.</ref> The B.2 had a lengthened fuselage with a total length of {{convert|112|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}}, in contrast to a length of {{convert|108|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} for the Valiant B.1, with the extra length giving room for more avionics.<ref name=\"Jones p32,6\">Jones 2007, pp. 32, 36.</ref>\n\nThe prototype B.2, serial number WJ954 first flew on 4 September 1953.<ref name=\"AndrewsVickers p445\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 445.</ref> Finished in a gloss black night operations paint scheme, it became known as the \"Black Bomber\". Its performance at low level was superior to that of the B.1 (or any other V-bomber), being strong enough to fly at full power at [[sea level#Aviation|sea level]],<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/> with the aircraft being cleared for {{convert|580|mph|abbr=on}} at low level (with speeds of up to {{convert|640|mph|abbr=on}} being reached in testing). This was compared to the B.1's sea-level limit of {{convert|414|mph|abbr=on|round=5}}. The Air Ministry ordered 17 production B.2s, which were to be powered by [[Rolls-Royce Conway]] [[turbofan]]s. Although the Valiant B.2's low-level capabilities later proved to be highly desirable, the B.2 program was abandoned as the RAF considered that the Pathfinder concept, born in a time of mass raids, was obsolete in the nuclear era.<ref name = \"bomber 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 78.</ref> The B.2 prototype was used for tests for a few years, including testing use of rockets to boost takeoff, contributing to improvements for the Valiant B.1, before being scrapped in 1958.<ref name=\"Jones p36-7\">Jones 2007, pp. 36\u201337.</ref><ref name=\"Osprey p83-4\">Brookes 2012, pp. 83\u201384.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 20\"/>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Vickers Valian B.1 WZ393 90 Sqn SGT 10.06.57.jpg|thumb|Valiant B(PR)K.1 WZ393 of 90 Squadron in original all-metal finish displaying at Blackpool Squires Gate airport in 1957]]\nIn April 1951, an initial production order for 25 Valiant B.1 (Bomber Mark 1) aircraft was placed by the Ministry of Supply on behalf of the RAF.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p400\">Burnet and Morgan ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 400.</ref> The timing of this order was key to establishing production quickly. Due to shortages of [[steel]] and other materials while setting up an assembly line at Brooklands, substantial portions of the production [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] for the Valiant were made from [[concrete]].<ref name = \"bomber 77\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 77.</ref> The first five Valiants produced were completed to a pre-production standard, the first being WP199.

The Victor and Vulcan would soon follow the Valiant into service, for a total of three types of nuclear-armed strategic bombers in RAF service. In September 1957, the final Valiant was delivered.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/> According to Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, all production aircraft had been delivered on time and below budget.<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/>\n\nA total of 108 Valiants were manufactured, including the sole B.2 prototype. In addition to its principal role as the RAF's delivery platform for Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]], the Valiant bomber also dropped high explosive bombs. The bombers were followed into service by a strategic reconnaissance version and a multi-purpose version capable conventional bombing, [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]]. One squadron operated 6 Valiants with [[electronic countermeasure]]s equipment.<ref name = \"black wright 19 20\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>  Valiants of 90 and 214 squadrons were used for air refuelling through the addition of a Hose Drum Unit (HDU) in the bomb bay, mounted on the same suspension units that were also used for bombs.  This meant that for refuelling, the bomb-bay doors had to be opened so that the refuelling hose could be streamed (unlike later tankers where the HDU was flush with the under fuselage rather than inside a bomb bay).  Several Valiants were also used for testing and development purposes, such as its use as a flying testbed during trials of the [[Blue Steel (missile)|Blue Steel]] nuclear-armed [[standoff missile]], which was later added to the arsenal of munitions the other V-bombers were equipped with.<ref name = \"black wright 24 26\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 24\u201326.</ref><ref name = \"flint 133\">Flintham 2008, p. 133.</ref>\n\nUnlike its Vulcan and Victor peers, the Valiant did not see the production of a refined and more capable B.2 model.<ref name = \"flint 131\"/> Instead, the Valiant B.1 fleet was later switched to a low-level flight profile, after which [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] due to the resulting increased turbulence was discovered and ultimately led to the type's premature retirement. Vic Flintham observed that: \"There is a fine irony to the situation, for Vickers had produced the Type 673 B Mk 2 version designed as a fast, low-level pathfinder... The Air Ministry was not interested...\"<ref name = \"flint 133\"/> The Valiant was Vickers' last purpose-built military aircraft.

Circa mid-1960s]]\nPeacetime practice involved the dropping of small practice bombs on instrumented bombing ranges, and a system of predicted bombing using radio tones to mark the position of the bomb drop over non-range targets, the bomb error being calculated by a ground radar unit and passed either to the crew during flight or to a headquarters for analysis. Use of the Valiant's Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and the high quality of assigned crews, who were typically veterans and often had been previously decorated for wartime service, meant a high level of bombing accuracy could be achieved, greater than that of aircraft during the Second World War. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, Valiant crews were able to place practice bombs from an altitude of {{convert|45,000|ft}} within a few meters of their assigned target.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>\n\nThe Valiant was the first of the V-bombers to see combat, during the Anglo-French-Israeli Suez intervention in October and November 1956. During [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]], the British military operation in what became known as the [[Suez Crisis]], Valiants operating from the airfield at Luqa on Malta repeatedly dropped conventional bombs on targets inside Egypt. Egyptian military airfields were the principal target of these bombing raids; other targets included communications such as [[radio station]]s and transport hubs.<ref>Bowman 2016, p. 158</ref> On the first night of the operation, six Valiants were dispatched to bomb [[Cairo West Air Base]] (which was aborted in flight due to potential risk to US personnel in the vicinity) while six more attacked [[Almaza Air Base]] and a further five bombed [[Kibrit Air Base]] and Huckstep Barracks.<ref name = \"black wright 42\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 42.</ref><ref name = \"darling 42\">Darling 2012, p. 42.</ref>\n\nAlthough the Egyptians did not oppose the attacks and there were no Valiant combat losses incurred, the results of the raids were reportedly disappointing.

The HDU was mounted on bomb-mounting points and could be removed if necessary; this arrangement meant that the bomb bay doors had to be opened in order to give fuel to a receiver aircraft. A control panel at the radar navigator station in the cockpit was used to operate the HDU.  All of the HDU equipment was designed to be easily removable so that the aircraft could be reverted to the bomber role.<ref>Tanner 2006, pp. 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nWith in-flight refuelling probes fitted to Valiants, Vulcans and Victors and Valiant tankers available to give fuel and extend the range of the aircraft being refuelled, the RAF Medium Bomber Force could go beyond \"medium range\", and the RAF had a long range capability.

Pilots reported problems with cabin heating and condensation that would need remedying. The aircraft was fitted with data recording equipment and these data were used by Vickers to estimate the remaining safe life of the type under these flying conditions.

Later inspection of the aircraft also showed the fuselage skin below the starboard inner plane had buckled, popping the rivets; the engine door had cracked and the rivets had been pulled and the skin buckled on the top surface of the mainplane between the two engines.<ref name = \"darling 39 40\">Darling 2012, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> Both of these aircraft were PR variants.<ref>Morgan, App 2, Individual Valiant Histories pp. 89\u201394.</ref>\n\nInspections of the entire fleet showed that the wing spars were suffering from fatigue at between 35% and 75% of the assessed safe fatigue life, probably due to low level turbulence.<ref name = \"darling 40\">Darling 2012, p. 40.</ref> After this inspection, the aircraft were divided into three categories, Cat A aircraft continuing to fly, Cat B to fly to a repair base, and Cat C requiring repair before flying again. The tanker squadrons had the highest proportion of Cat A aircraft because their role had been mainly at high level.<ref name = \"darling 40\"/> This also caused the methods of assessing fatigue lives to be reviewed.<ref>Wynn 1996, p. 465.</ref> By the time the type was scrapped, only about 50 aircraft were still in service; the rest had been slowly accumulating at various RAF Maintenance Units designated as \"Non effective Aircraft\".<ref>Morgan App2, pp. 89\u201394.</ref>\n\nInitially there was no question of retiring the type, or even a majority of affected aircraft. Repairs were actively taking place at Valiant bases such as Marham using working parties from Vickers plus RAF technicians from the base.  In January 1965, the Wilson government with [[Denis Healey]] as [[Secretary of State for Defence]] decided that the expense of the repairs could not be justified, given the short operational life left to the Valiant, and the fleet was permanently grounded as of 26 January 1965.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wGNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nKMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5895,4007485&dq=vickers+valiant&hl=en \"Valiants to be Scrapped.\"] ''Glasgow Herald'', 27 January 1965.</ref> The QRA alert that had been in place for [[SACEUR]] was maintained until the final grounding and was then allowed to lapse.<ref>Wynn 1996, pp. 464\u2013471, 500.</ref> When asked to make a statement regarding the Valiant's scrapping in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Denis Healey stated that it \"was not in any way connected with low-level flying\" and that the \"last Government took the decision to continue operating the Valiant force for another four years after its planned fatigue life was complete\".<ref>{{cite |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1965/feb/01/royal-air-force-valiant-aircraft#column_725|title=ROYAL AIR FORCE (VALIANT AIRCRAFT) |work=House of Commons Debates |date=1 February 1965 |volume=vol 705||at=cc723-7}}</ref>\n\nAviation author Barry Jones commented in his book that: \"A question has to be asked. For two years before the demise of the Valiant, Handley Page at Radlett had 100 [[Handley Page Hastings|Hastings]] go through their shops.

It was developed by [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] in response to [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] issued by the [[Air Ministry]] for a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] jet-powered bomber. The Valiant was the first of the V bombers to become operational, and was followed by the [[Handley Page Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan]], which were more advanced. The Valiant has the distinction of being the only V bomber to have dropped live nuclear weapons.<ref name = \"black wright 33\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 33.</ref>\n\nThe Valiant was intended as a high-altitude [[strategic bomber]]. During the late 1950s, in response to rapid advances in [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) technology, the Valiant fleet was switched to flying low-level for the strike role. Beyond the [[nuclear deterrence]] role, the Valiant was also used by the RAF for other purposes, as a number were converted to perform support roles such as [[aerial refuelling]] tankers and [[aerial reconnaissance]] aircraft. Valiants were used for conventional bombing missions over [[Egypt]] for [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956.\n\nBy late 1964 it was found that all variants of the Valiant showed premature fatigue and inter-crystalline corrosion in wing spar attachment forgings, traced to the use of a poorly understood aluminium alloy, DTD683.<ref>\u201cPitfalls of the substitution of sophistication for Common Sense\u201d  D Howe, Cranfield University. IMechE Vol 212 Part G, Sec 5.1 Metals, p. 307. May 1998</ref>{{#tag:ref|The rapid development of aircraft during World War II led to a demand for very high strength aluminium alloy, especially for use in highly loaded tension and compression members. One result was a zinc /magnesium based alloy given the identification DTD 683. It was ideal for such applications as wing spar caps providing, as was the case with wartime operations, the life of the aircraft was short. Use in early post-War transport aircraft showed that DTD 683 was very crack-sensitive and hence prone to fatigue failure. In many cases it had to be replaced by steel components. DTD 683 is an example of a material developed to meet a particular need, but whose wider characteristics were not investigated until too late.\nD.Howe 1998|group=N}} Rather than proceeding with an expensive rebuilding program, the Ministry of Defence retired the Valiant in 1965. Its duties were continued by the other V-bombers which remained in service until the 1980s.\n\n==Development==\n===Background and origins===\nIn November 1944, the Joint Technical Warfare  Committee, along with a separate committee chaired by Sir [[Henry Tizard]], examined the future potential  of \"weapons of war\" and the accompanying Tizard Report published on 3 July 1945 made specific policy directions for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]].<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\">Turpin 2002, p. 71.</ref> After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the policy of using heavy four-engined bombers for massed raids continued into the immediate postwar period; the [[Avro Lincoln]], an updated version of the [[Avro Lancaster]], became the RAF's standard bomber.<ref>McLelland 2013, p. 18.</ref> In 1946, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued Operational Requirements OR229 and OR230 for the development of [[jet aircraft|turbojet]]-powered heavy bombers capable of carrying [[nuclear weapon]]s at high altitude and speed, without defensive armament, to act as a deterrent to hostile powers and, if deterrence failed, to perform a nuclear strike.<ref name=\"Turpin p. 71\"/> In conjunction with this ambition, Britain set about developing its own [[nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|atomic weapons]].<ref name = \"flint 131\"/>\n\nIn January 1947, the British [[Air Ministry]] issued [[Air Ministry specification|Specification B.35/46]] for an advanced jet bomber intended to carry nuclear weapons and to fly near the speed of sound at altitudes of {{cvt|50000|ft|m}}.<ref name = 'Rose 52'/> Three firms: [[Avro|A.V. Roe]], [[Handley-Page Aircraft Company|Handley-Page]] and [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] submitted advanced designs intended to meet the stringent requirements.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p397\">Burnet and Morgan  ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 397.</ref> While [[Short Brothers]] submitted a design, by [[Geoffrey T. R.

Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist described Specification B.14/46 as \"calling for little more than a traditional aircraft fitted with jet engines\"<ref name = \"bomber 72\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 72.</ref> Short submitted a conservative design to meet B.14/46, which became the [[Short Sperrin|S.A.4 Sperrin]].<ref name = 'Rose 52'/> Two prototypes were completed, the first conducting its [[maiden flight]] in 1951, but the Sperrin was ultimately relegated to research and development purposes only.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p397\"/><ref name = \"flint 131\"/>\n\nVickers had emerged from the Second World War as one of the world's pre-eminent companies in the field of aeronautical manufacturing and development. Furthermore, the company operated its own secretive [[Skunk Works]]-like development organisation based at Weybridge, Surrey, which had been involved in several secret wartime development projects. It was this secretive division in which the early stages of the development of the Valiant took place, including the later assembly of the initial two prototypes.<ref name = \"bomber 72 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> Vickers initially produced a six-engine jet bomber design proposal to meet Specification B.35/46; as rapid progress in the development of more powerful jet engines had been made, this was re-worked to a four-engine proposal in 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 73.</ref> The proposed design submitted by Vickers was relatively straightforward, being less aerodynamically advanced in comparison to competing bids made by rival firms.<ref name = \"bomber 72\"/><ref name = \"black wright 17\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 17.</ref>\n\nBoth Handley-Page and Avro had produced advanced designs for the bomber competition. These would be produced as the [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]] and the [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] respectively; the Air Staff decided to award contracts to each company as a form of insurance in case one of these designs failed. The submissions became known as the [[V bomber]]s, or V-class, with the aircraft all being given names that started with the letter \"V\".<ref>Downey 1985, p. 5.</ref> Vickers' submission had initially been rejected as not being as advanced as the Victor and the Vulcan,<ref name = 'Rose 52'>Rosemeyer 2009, p. 52.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> but Vickers' chief designer [[George Edwards (aviation)|George Edwards]] lobbied the Air Ministry on the basis that it would be available much sooner than the competition, going so far as to promise that a flight-capable prototype would be flown by the end of 1951, that subsequent production aircraft would be flown prior to the end of 1953, and that serial deliveries would commence during early 1955. Gunston and Gilchrist observe that measures offered by Edwards were a \"gigantic risk\", and that gaining the bomber contract has been deemed of crucial importance to the future of aircraft manufacturing at Vickers.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/>\n\nAlthough developing and operating three overlapping large aircraft in response to a single Operational Requirement (OR) was wasteful and very costly, events such as the [[Berlin Blockade]] had led to officials placing a sense of urgency in the necessity to provide an effective deterrent to the Soviet Union from acts of aggression in Europe.<ref>Rosemeyer 2009, pp. 52\u201353.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 72\"/> In April 1948, the [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] issued a specification with the designation B.9/48 written around the Vickers design, which was given the company designation of Type 660; an 'Instruction to Proceed' was received by Vickers on 16 April 1948.<ref name = \"bomber 73\"/> In February 1949, two prototypes of the aircraft were ordered. The first of these was to be fitted with four [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Avon|RA.3 Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines, while the second was to be fitted with four [[Armstrong Siddeley]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire|Sapphire]] engines as the Type 667.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p438\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 438.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:Vickers Valiant Farnborough 1951.jpg|thumb|First prototype performing a flight display at [[Farnborough Airshow]], 1951]]\nOn 18 May 1951, the first prototype, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] WB210 took to the air for its [[maiden flight]],<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p439\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 439.</ref> within the deadline that George Edwards had promised, and preceding the first [[Short Sperrin]] into the air by several months, it being only 27 months since the contract had been issued. The pilot was [[Joseph Summers|Captain Joseph \"Mutt\" Summers]], who had also been the original test pilot on the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], and wanted to add another \"first\" to his record before he retired. His co-pilot on the first flight was Gabe \"Jock\" Bryce, who succeeded Summers as Vickers' chief test pilot upon his retirement shortly afterwards.<ref name=\"Turpin p. 72\">Turpin 2002, p. 72.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 10\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 10.</ref><ref>McLelland 2013, p. 68.</ref> The next month, the Vickers Type 660 was given the official name of \"Valiant\", recycling the name given to the [[Vickers 131 Valiant|Vickers Type 131]] general-purpose biplane of 1931.{{#tag:ref|Traditionally, RAF bombers had been named after towns and cities, for example Lancaster, [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax]] and [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]], but the new aircraft technology seemed to suggest a break from tradition; the name also fitted in with an equally long held tradition of alliteration in aircraft names.|group=N}} The name Valiant had been selected by a survey of Vickers employees.<ref name=\"Jones p31,3\">Jones 2007, pp. 31, 33.</ref>\n\nOn 11 January 1952, the first Valiant prototype was lost while making internal noise measurements for the V.1000 programme. Testing included engine shutdowns and re-lights,<ref>The Vickers Valiant, C F Andrews, Profile Publications Ltd., P O Box 26, Leatherhead, p.4</ref> one of which caused a fire in the starboard wing; most of the crew managed to escape the aircraft safely, except for the co-pilot, who struck the tail after ejecting.<ref name=\"Flight p13\">''Flight'' 4 July 1958, p. 13.</ref><ref>Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 11\u201316.</ref>  After modifications to the fuel system the second prototype, serial number WB215, the Vickers Type 667, conducted its maiden flight on 11 April 1952.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p440\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 440.</ref> It was fitted with more powerful RA.7 Avon engines with {{convert|7500|lbf|kN}} thrust each, rather than the Sapphires that had been originally planned; it also featured more rounded [[Components of jet engines#Air intakes|air inlet]]s, replacing the narrow slot-type intakes of the first prototype, in order to feed sufficient air to the more powerful engines. The short delay until the second prototype became available for testing, which was accelerated by three months, meant that loss of the initial prototype did not seriously compromise the schedule.<ref name=\"Turpin p74\">Turpin 2002, p. 74.</ref><ref name=\"Jones p34\">Jones 2007, p. 34.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 17\"/>\n\nOf the three prototypes, two were representative of the Valiant B.1,<ref name=\"Jones p26\">Jones 2007, p. 26.</ref> while one was built as a further developed version, referred to as the Valiant B.2. The B.2 variant was intended to serve as a [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinder]] aircraft, flying at high speed at low level to mark targets for the main bomber force. To cope with the rougher ride compared with high altitude operations, the B.2 had a strengthened airframe. In particular, the wing received design alterations to strengthen it, a key change being the removal of the large cut-outs in the wing structure into which the main wheels retracted, allowing the wing torsion box structure to be uninterrupted and giving more room for internal fuel storage; instead the main landing gear, which had four wheels instead of the two large wheels of the B.1, retracted backwards into large [[Aircraft fairing|fairing]]s set into the rear of the wings.<ref name = \"bomber 77 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 77\u201378.</ref> The B.2 had a lengthened fuselage with a total length of {{convert|112|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}}, in contrast to a length of {{convert|108|ft|3|in|abbr=on}} for the Valiant B.1, with the extra length giving room for more avionics.<ref name=\"Jones p32,6\">Jones 2007, pp. 32, 36.</ref>\n\nThe prototype B.2, serial number WJ954 first flew on 4 September 1953.<ref name=\"AndrewsVickers p445\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 445.</ref> Finished in a gloss black night operations paint scheme, it became known as the \"Black Bomber\". Its performance at low level was superior to that of the B.1 (or any other V-bomber), being strong enough to fly at full power at [[sea level#Aviation|sea level]],<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/> with the aircraft being cleared for {{convert|580|mph|abbr=on}} at low level (with speeds of up to {{convert|640|mph|abbr=on}} being reached in testing). This was compared to the B.1's sea-level limit of {{convert|414|mph|abbr=on|round=5}}. The Air Ministry ordered 17 production B.2s, which were to be powered by [[Rolls-Royce Conway]] [[turbofan]]s. Although the Valiant B.2's low-level capabilities later proved to be highly desirable, the B.2 program was abandoned as the RAF considered that the Pathfinder concept, born in a time of mass raids, was obsolete in the nuclear era.<ref name = \"bomber 78\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 78.</ref> The B.2 prototype was used for tests for a few years, including testing use of rockets to boost takeoff, contributing to improvements for the Valiant B.1, before being scrapped in 1958.<ref name=\"Jones p36-7\">Jones 2007, pp. 36\u201337.</ref><ref name=\"Osprey p83-4\">Brookes 2012, pp. 83\u201384.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 20\"/>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Vickers Valian B.1 WZ393 90 Sqn SGT 10.06.57.jpg|thumb|Valiant B(PR)K.1 WZ393 of 90 Squadron in original all-metal finish displaying at Blackpool Squires Gate airport in 1957]]\nIn April 1951, an initial production order for 25 Valiant B.1 (Bomber Mark 1) aircraft was placed by the Ministry of Supply on behalf of the RAF.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p400\">Burnet and Morgan ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 400.</ref> The timing of this order was key to establishing production quickly. Due to shortages of [[steel]] and other materials while setting up an assembly line at Brooklands, substantial portions of the production [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] for the Valiant were made from [[concrete]].<ref name = \"bomber 77\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 77.</ref> The first five Valiants produced were completed to a pre-production standard, the first being WP199. On 21 December 1953, the production aircraft conducted its first flight; this had again occurred within the schedule that Edwards had promised.<ref name=\"Jones p37\">Jones 2007, p. 37.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 77\"/>\n\nOn 8 February 1955, this first production Valiant was delivered to the RAF.<ref name=\"Osprey p12\">Brookes 2012, p. 12.</ref><ref name = \"flint 131\">Flintham 2008, p. 131.</ref> Britain's \"V-bomber\" force, as it had been nicknamed in October 1952, formally entered operational service on that day. The Victor and Vulcan would soon follow the Valiant into service, for a total of three types of nuclear-armed strategic bombers in RAF service. In September 1957, the final Valiant was delivered.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/> According to Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, all production aircraft had been delivered on time and below budget.<ref name = \"bomber 78\"/>\n\nA total of 108 Valiants were manufactured, including the sole B.2 prototype. In addition to its principal role as the RAF's delivery platform for Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]], the Valiant bomber also dropped high explosive bombs. The bombers were followed into service by a strategic reconnaissance version and a multi-purpose version capable conventional bombing, [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]]. One squadron operated 6 Valiants with [[electronic countermeasure]]s equipment.<ref name = \"black wright 19 20\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>  Valiants of 90 and 214 squadrons were used for air refuelling through the addition of a Hose Drum Unit (HDU) in the bomb bay, mounted on the same suspension units that were also used for bombs.  This meant that for refuelling, the bomb-bay doors had to be opened so that the refuelling hose could be streamed (unlike later tankers where the HDU was flush with the under fuselage rather than inside a bomb bay).  Several Valiants were also used for testing and development purposes, such as its use as a flying testbed during trials of the [[Blue Steel (missile)|Blue Steel]] nuclear-armed [[standoff missile]], which was later added to the arsenal of munitions the other V-bombers were equipped with.<ref name = \"black wright 24 26\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 24\u201326.</ref><ref name = \"flint 133\">Flintham 2008, p. 133.</ref>\n\nUnlike its Vulcan and Victor peers, the Valiant did not see the production of a refined and more capable B.2 model.<ref name = \"flint 131\"/> Instead, the Valiant B.1 fleet was later switched to a low-level flight profile, after which [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] due to the resulting increased turbulence was discovered and ultimately led to the type's premature retirement. Vic Flintham observed that: \"There is a fine irony to the situation, for Vickers had produced the Type 673 B Mk 2 version designed as a fast, low-level pathfinder... The Air Ministry was not interested...\"<ref name = \"flint 133\"/> The Valiant was Vickers' last purpose-built military aircraft. It was followed by the [[Vickers Vanguard|Vanguard]], a passenger turboprop designed in 1959, and the [[Vickers VC10]], a jet passenger aircraft in 1962, also used as a military transport and tanker by the RAF.<ref name = \"flint 131\"/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Vickers Valiant (27363801724).jpg|thumb|Forward view of preserved Vickers Valiant XD818 at [[RAF Museum Cosford]] ]]\nThe Valiant was a conservative design of the era, having a shoulder-mounted wing and four [[Rolls-Royce Avon|Rolls-Royce Avon RA.3]] [[turbojet]] engines, each providing up to {{convert|6500|lbf|kN}} of thrust, installed in pairs in [[fireproof]] bays in each wing root.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The design of the Valiant gave an overall impression of a plain and clean aircraft with simple aerodynamics. George Edwards described the Valiant appropriately and simply as an \"unfunny\" aircraft.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p449\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 449.</ref> The root chord thickness ratio was 12% and allowed the Avon engines to be within the wing rather than on pods as in the contemporary [[B-47 Stratojet|Boeing B-47]].<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p442\">Andrews and Morgan, p. 442.</ref> This \"buried engine\" installation contributed to the aircraft's aerodynamic cleanness, and was British practice at the time. It made engine access for maintenance and repair difficult and increased the risk that an uncontained failure of one engine would cause damage to the adjacent engine; it also increased the complexity of the design of the main spar which had to be routed around the engines.<ref name = \"bomber 73 74\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nThe wing of the Valiant used a \"compound sweep\" configuration, devised by Vickers [[aerodynamics|aerodynamicist]] Elfyn Richards.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\">Barfield ''Air International'' September 1992, p. 158.</ref> Richards found that it would be advantageous to increase the sweep on the inboard section of the wing, a discovery which he later [[patent]]ed; the Valiant's wing made use of a 37\u00b0 angle of sweepback for the inner third of the wing, which reduced to an angle of about 21\u00b0 at the tips.<ref name=\"Aero Aug80 p398\">Burnet and Morgan  ''Aeroplane Monthly'' August 1980, p. 398.</ref><ref name = \"bomber 74\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 74.</ref> This was because the thickness/chord ratio could be reduced closer to the tips, balancing this against the sweep reduction in postponement of supersonic airflow effects such as buffeting and increased drag.<ref name=\"Barfield p158\"/> The choice to have mild sweepback around the aerodynamic control surfaces meant that in-service speeds were limited to Mach 0.84 and a typical cruise of Mach 0.75 at heights up to {{convert|55000|ft}} when lightly loaded.<ref name=\"Profile p16\">Andrews 1966, p. 16.</ref><ref name = \"black wright 17 18\">Blackman and Wright 2015, pp. 17\u201318.</ref> A [[drogue parachute]] was deemed unnecessary even operating from runways as short as {{Convert|6000|ft}}.<ref name = \"bomber 77\"/>\n\nThe wing was mounted high on the aircraft's fuselage and this created a limited fuel capacity when combined with the other necessary compromises in design such as the placement of the engines and main [[landing gear]] within the wing's internal space.<ref name = \"bomber 75\"/> The [[leading edge]] of the wing was fixed while the [[trailing edge]] incorporated large outboard two-section [[aileron]]s, the inner section featuring [[trim tab]]s, alongside double-slotted [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s again split into inboard and outboard sections.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> Direct [[electric motor|electrical drive]]s were used to move the flaps and other, usually hydraulically-operated, equipment on the aircraft.<ref name = \"bomber 76\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 76.</ref>\n\n[[File:Valiant 2 (3446560911).jpg|thumb|left|The wing root and air intakes]]\nProduction aircraft were powered by four Avon 201 turbojet engines, with {{convert|9500|lbf|kN}} thrust.

They were repainted in grey/green camouflage with normal markings, replacing their [[anti-flash white]] scheme.<ref name = \"flint 133\"/> By 1963, four Valiant squadrons (49, 148, 207 and 214) had been assigned to [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SACEUR]] in the low-level tactical bombing role.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/> By this point, there had been a noticeable decline in flying rates for the type.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>\n\n===Conventional warfare===\n[[File:vickers valiant camouflaged on ground arp.jpg|thumb|Camouflaged Valiant at [[Bristol Filton Airport|Filton]], [[England]]. Circa mid-1960s]]\nPeacetime practice involved the dropping of small practice bombs on instrumented bombing ranges, and a system of predicted bombing using radio tones to mark the position of the bomb drop over non-range targets, the bomb error being calculated by a ground radar unit and passed either to the crew during flight or to a headquarters for analysis. Use of the Valiant's Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and the high quality of assigned crews, who were typically veterans and often had been previously decorated for wartime service, meant a high level of bombing accuracy could be achieved, greater than that of aircraft during the Second World War. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, Valiant crews were able to place practice bombs from an altitude of {{convert|45,000|ft}} within a few meters of their assigned target.<ref name = \"bomber 79\"/>\n\nThe Valiant was the first of the V-bombers to see combat, during the Anglo-French-Israeli Suez intervention in October and November 1956. During [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]], the British military operation in what became known as the [[Suez Crisis]], Valiants operating from the airfield at Luqa on Malta repeatedly dropped conventional bombs on targets inside Egypt. Egyptian military airfields were the principal target of these bombing raids; other targets included communications such as [[radio station]]s and transport hubs.<ref>Bowman 2016, p. 158</ref> On the first night of the operation, six Valiants were dispatched to bomb [[Cairo West Air Base]] (which was aborted in flight due to potential risk to US personnel in the vicinity) while six more attacked [[Almaza Air Base]] and a further five bombed [[Kibrit Air Base]] and Huckstep Barracks.<ref name = \"black wright 42\">Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 42.</ref><ref name = \"darling 42\">Darling 2012, p. 42.</ref>\n\nAlthough the Egyptians did not oppose the attacks and there were no Valiant combat losses incurred, the results of the raids were reportedly disappointing. Although the Valiants dropped a total of {{convert|842|LT}} of bombs, only three of the seven airfields attacked were seriously damaged.{{#tag:ref|The Valiants had not yet been fitted with their operational Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and were dropping using Second World War techniques.|group=N}} The Egyptian Air Force had been effectively destroyed in a wider series of multinational attacks of which the Valiant bombing missions had been a part.<ref>Bowman 2016, pp. 158, 161.</ref> It was the last time the V-bombers flew a live combat mission until Avro Vulcans bombed Port Stanley airfield in the Falkland Islands during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.<ref>McClelland, pp.175\u2013178.</ref>\n\n===Tanker operations===\nValiant tankers were flown by No. 214 Squadron at [[RAF Marham]], operational in 1958, and No. 90 Squadron at Honington, operational in 1959.<ref name = \"hub and sim 26\"/> The two lost their bomber role and became full-time tanker squadrons on 1 April 1962.<ref>Brookes 1982, p. 142</ref> Aircraft assigned to the tanker role were fitted with a Hose Drum Unit (HDU or \"HooDoo\") in the bomb bay. The HDU was mounted on bomb-mounting points and could be removed if necessary; this arrangement meant that the bomb bay doors had to be opened in order to give fuel to a receiver aircraft. A control panel at the radar navigator station in the cockpit was used to operate the HDU.  All of the HDU equipment was designed to be easily removable so that the aircraft could be reverted to the bomber role.<ref>Tanner 2006, pp. 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nWith in-flight refuelling probes fitted to Valiants, Vulcans and Victors and Valiant tankers available to give fuel and extend the range of the aircraft being refuelled, the RAF Medium Bomber Force could go beyond \"medium range\", and the RAF had a long range capability. Long-range demonstration flights were made using Valiant tankers pre-deployed along the route.

Several modifications to the aircraft were made, including a metal radome, debris guards on the two inboard engines, and after six flights the aileron and elevator artificial feel was reduced by 50%. Pilots reported problems with cabin heating and condensation that would need remedying. The aircraft was fitted with data recording equipment and these data were used by Vickers to estimate the remaining safe life of the type under these flying conditions. Initially a safe life of 75 hours was recommended, which became \"the real figure might be less than 200 hours\".<ref>Morgan p. 66-68</ref> The number of hours flown by each Valiant in a year was an operational issue for the RAF.<ref>Valiant Units of the Cold War, Brookes p. 88.</ref>\n\n[[File:15 Vickers Valiant WZ397 (15216077444).jpg|thumb|left|Vickers Valiant on display]]\nLater the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] ran a similar series of tests that more closely resembled actual operational conditions including low level and taxiing; the corresponding report published in 1958 produced data that could be used to get a better grasp on which flight conditions produced the most damage, and enable a better projection of the future life span for the type.<ref>[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0521.pdf \"Fatigue Loadings in Flight-Loads in the Nose Undercarriage and Wing of a Valiant.\"] E.W.

The aircraft landed back at Gaydon but without flap deployment because damage to the starboard rear spar caused the flap rollers to come out of their guides so that the flap would not lower on that side. Later inspection of the aircraft also showed the fuselage skin below the starboard inner plane had buckled, popping the rivets; the engine door had cracked and the rivets had been pulled and the skin buckled on the top surface of the mainplane between the two engines.<ref name = \"darling 39 40\">Darling 2012, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> Both of these aircraft were PR variants.<ref>Morgan, App 2, Individual Valiant Histories pp. 89\u201394.</ref>\n\nInspections of the entire fleet showed that the wing spars were suffering from fatigue at between 35% and 75% of the assessed safe fatigue life, probably due to low level turbulence.<ref name = \"darling 40\">Darling 2012, p. 40.</ref> After this inspection, the aircraft were divided into three categories, Cat A aircraft continuing to fly, Cat B to fly to a repair base, and Cat C requiring repair before flying again.

Repairs were actively taking place at Valiant bases such as Marham using working parties from Vickers plus RAF technicians from the base.  In January 1965, the Wilson government with [[Denis Healey]] as [[Secretary of State for Defence]] decided that the expense of the repairs could not be justified, given the short operational life left to the Valiant, and the fleet was permanently grounded as of 26 January 1965.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wGNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nKMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5895,4007485&dq=vickers+valiant&hl=en \"Valiants to be Scrapped.\"] ''Glasgow Herald'', 27 January 1965.</ref> The QRA alert that had been in place for [[SACEUR]] was maintained until the final grounding and was then allowed to lapse.<ref>Wynn 1996, pp. 464\u2013471, 500.</ref> When asked to make a statement regarding the Valiant's scrapping in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Denis Healey stated that it \"was not in any way connected with low-level flying\" and that the \"last Government took the decision to continue operating the Valiant force for another four years after its planned fatigue life was complete\".<ref>{{cite |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1965/feb/01/royal-air-force-valiant-aircraft#column_725|title=ROYAL AIR FORCE (VALIANT AIRCRAFT) |work=House of Commons Debates |date=1 February 1965 |volume=vol 705||at=cc723-7}}</ref>\n\nAviation author Barry Jones commented in his book that: \"A question has to be asked.
