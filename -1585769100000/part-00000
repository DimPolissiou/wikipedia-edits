{"title_page": "Two-child policy", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\nA '''two-children policy''' is a government-imposed limit of two children allowed per family or the payment of government subsidies only to the first two children. It has previously been used in [[Vietnam]]. In [[British Hong Kong]] in the 1970s, citizens were also highly encouraged to have two children as a limit (although it was not mandated by law), and it was used as part of the region's family planning strategies. Since 2015, it has been implemented in [[China]], replacing the country's previous [[one-child policy]].<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news |title= China to end one-child policy and allow two |work= BBC |date= 29 October 2015 |url= \nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34665539 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-10/29/c_134763507.htm|title=China to allow two children for all couples|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] |date=29 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== China (Mainland) ==\nDuring the 1970s, Chinese citizens were permitted to have only one child.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/one-child-policy|title=one-child policy - Definition & Facts|publisher=}}</ref> The ongoing [[Cultural Revolution]] and the strain it placed on the nation were large factors.

Depending on the specific location, district governments charged fines ranging from 60 to 800 kilograms of paddy rice, equivalent to the worth of a month to a year's wages, for each additional child, and additionally, women who agreed to be sterilized were given bonuses of 120 to 400 kilograms of rice.

An offspring formed from the union of a [[sperm]] and an [[egg (biology)|egg]] develops as a female, and an unfertilized egg develops as a male. This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes that a female has, and are [[haploid]].\n\nThe haplodiploid sex-determination system has a number of peculiarities. For example, a male has no father and cannot have sons, but he has a grandfather and can have grandsons. Additionally, if a [[eusociality|eusocial]]-insect colony has only one queen, and she has only mated once, then the [[relatedness]] between workers (diploid females) in a hive or nest is {{3/4}}. This means the workers in such monogamous single-queen colonies are significantly more closely related than in other sex determination systems where the relatedness of siblings is usually no more than {{1/2}}.

In haplodiploidy, males receive one half of the chromosomes that females receive, including [[autosomes]].  In an X0 sex-determination system, males and females receive an equal number of autosomes, but when it comes to sex chromosomes, females will receive two X chromosomes while males will receive only a single X chromosome.\n\n== Mechanisms ==\n\nSeveral models have been proposed for the genetic mechanisms of haplodiploid sex-determination. The model most commonly referred to is the ''complementary allele model''. According to this model, if an individual is [[heterozygous]] for a certain [[locus (genetics)|locus]], it develops into a female, whereas [[hemizygous]] and [[homozygous]] individuals develop into males. In other words, [[diploid]] offspring develop from fertilized eggs, and are normally female, while haploid offspring develop into males from unfertilized eggs.\nDiploid males would be infertile, as their cells would not undergo [[meiosis]] to form sperm.  Therefore, the sperm would be diploid, which means that their offspring would be [[triploid]].  Since hymenopteran mother and sons share the same genes, they may be especially sensitive to [[inbreeding]]: Inbreeding reduces the number of different sex [[allele]]s present in a population, hence increasing the occurrence of diploid males.\n\nAfter [[mating]], each fertile hymenopteran female stores [[sperm]] in an internal sac called the [[spermatheca]]. The mated female controls the release of stored sperm from within the organ: If she releases sperm as an egg passes down her [[oviduct]], the egg is fertilized.<ref>van Wilgenburg, Ellen; Driessen, Gerard & Beukeboom, Leo W.

An offspring formed from the union of a [[sperm]] and an [[egg (biology)|egg]] develops as a female, and an unfertilized egg develops as a male. This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes that a female has, and are [[haploid]].\n\nThe haplodiploid sex-determination system has a number of peculiarities. For example, a male has no father and cannot have sons, but he has a grandfather and can have grandsons. Additionally, if a [[eusociality|eusocial]]-insect colony has only one queen, and she has only mated once, then the [[relatedness]] between workers (diploid females) in a hive or nest is {{3/4}}. This means the workers in such monogamous single-queen colonies are significantly more closely related than in other sex determination systems where the relatedness of siblings is usually no more than {{1/2}}. It is this point which drives the [[kin selection]] theory of how eusociality evolved.<ref name=Grimaldi465>{{cite book |author1=Grimaldi, D. |author2=Engel M.S.  |date=2005 |title=The evolution of the insects |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-82149-0 |page=465}}</ref> Whether haplodiploidy did in fact pave the way for the evolution of eusociality is still a matter of debate.<ref name=Hughes>{{cite journal| last=Hughes |first= W.O.H. | title=Ancestral monogamy shows kin selection is key to the evolution of eusociality | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=320 | issue=5880 | pages=1213\u20131216 | year=2008| doi=10.1126/science.1156108 | pmid=18511689 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=eowilson>{{cite journal | author=Edward O.

In haplodiploidy, males receive one half of the chromosomes that females receive, including [[autosomes]].  In an X0 sex-determination system, males and females receive an equal number of autosomes, but when it comes to sex chromosomes, females will receive two X chromosomes while males will receive only a single X chromosome.\n\n== Mechanisms ==\n\nSeveral models have been proposed for the genetic mechanisms of haplodiploid sex-determination. The model most commonly referred to is the ''complementary allele model''. According to this model, if an individual is [[heterozygous]] for a certain [[locus (genetics)|locus]], it develops into a female, whereas [[hemizygous]] and [[homozygous]] individuals develop into males. In other words, [[diploid]] offspring develop from fertilized eggs, and are normally female, while haploid offspring develop into males from unfertilized eggs.\nDiploid males would be infertile, as their cells would not undergo [[meiosis]] to form sperm.  Therefore, the sperm would be diploid, which means that their offspring would be [[triploid]].  Since hymenopteran mother and sons share the same genes, they may be especially sensitive to [[inbreeding]]: Inbreeding reduces the number of different sex [[allele]]s present in a population, hence increasing the occurrence of diploid males.\n\nAfter [[mating]], each fertile hymenopteran female stores [[sperm]] in an internal sac called the [[spermatheca]]. The mated female controls the release of stored sperm from within the organ: If she releases sperm as an egg passes down her [[oviduct]], the egg is fertilized.<ref>van Wilgenburg, Ellen; Driessen, Gerard & Beukeboom, Leo W.

The diploid queen has 32 chromosomes and the haploid drones have 16 chromosomes.

In 1907 the college was recognised by the Board of Education and began to receive public money towards its support.\n\nFrom the early 1950s the school complement averaged about 700 boys. Its longest serving Headmaster, Fr Guy Brinkworth SJ, retired in 1963. The school remained at Stamford Hill as a grammar school until 1968. The school then became a two-tier, seven-form entry [[comprehensive school]], the lower school being located at the old Cardinal Allen School, which had been there for eight years prior to the school moving there, and the upper school located in Turkey Street, Enfield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=about-us/history-school|title=History of the School {{!}} St Ignatius College|website=www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Front of St Ignatius College, Enfield, Middlesex.png|thumb|200px|right|Turkey Street Building in 2006]]\nIn 1987, the lower and upper schools amalgamated at Turkey Street, a development made possible by a major building programme. The school became grant maintained in 1993 but returned to [[Voluntary aided school|Voluntary Aided]] status in September 1999. At the [[century|centenary]] celebrations in 1994, the newly refurbished chapel was unveiled, and every pupil received a book detailing the history of the school and its past teachers. In 1998 the school started to build the Octagon which houses a computer suite and a library. The building work was completed in 2000 and was handed over to the school later that year. Also in 2000, the newly refurbished Roselands Centre for the Sixth Form was opened. In 2006 the school raised \u00a350,000 through various events held at the school and donations from past pupils. School enrollment has risen to 1,300 pupils. \n\nMichael Blundell became the college's first lay Headmaster when he succeeded Fr Antony Forrester SJ, in 1986. Mr Blundell was in turn succeeded as Headmaster by Paul Adams, who retired in the summer of 2007, and was replaced by John-Paul Morrison, who left the post of headmaster in December 2013. Andrew Dickson took over the post on an interim basis until a replacement for John-Paul Morrison could be found. Kelly took over from Dickson in 2014 and retired from his role in 2016 and was succeeded by Mrs O'Keeffe, the first female headteacher of a Jesuit secondary school in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Loyola Preparatory School==\nIn 1900, the college began a preparatory department. However, in 1944 this preparatory department became Loyola Preparatory School, a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]] boys [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] run by the Jesuits. In 1950, Loyola Preparatory School moved to a site in [[Buckhurst Hill]] in [[Essex]] that was formerly occupied by [[Braeside School, Buckhurst Hill|Braeside School]].<ref>[http://www.loyola.essex.sch.uk/index.php?page=our-100-year-history History] from Loyola.Essex.sch.uk, retrieved 7 August 2017</ref> In 1962, [[Campion School, Hornchurch|Campion School]], a Jesuit secondary school, was opened in [[Hornchurch]], making Loyola Preparatory School a feeder school for both the college and Campion School.\n\nIn 2001, trusteeship of Loyola Preparatory School was given to the [[Diocese of Brentwood]] and as of 2017, Loyola Preparatory School teaches boys from the ages of 3 to 11 and has 190 pupils.<ref>[http://www.isi.net/school/loyola-preparatory-school-6661 Loyola Preparatory School], [[Independent Schools Inspectorate]], retrieved 7 August 2017</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Loyola Preparatory School became the best Under-11 school football team in England by winning the national final of the [[Danone Nations Cup]] at the [[bet365 Stadium]].<ref>Tom Barnes, [http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/15364476.Youngsters_crowned_England__39_s_best_school_football_team/ Loyola Preparatory School in Buckhurst Hill lifts Danone Nations Cup to be crowned best school football team in England] from ''East London and West Essex Guardian'', 22 June 2017, retrieved 7 August 2017</ref>\n\n== School buildings ==\n=== Main building ===\nThe present building was first occupied in January 1968, staff and boys moving from the Stamford Hill site. The main building of the school has since seen improvements made to it such as new extensions. Years 7 to 11 occupy this building. There are three floors, each one holding at least three departments. \n\nOriginally the school only used two floors for years 7 to 11, and the Sixth Form occupied the 3rd floor. However, overcrowding again became a problem and the school acquired the \"Roselands\" building from the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who had a place of residence there. The school also built another floor on top of the current technology wing to serve as the \"first line\" block. In this extension project a section dedicated to the study of music and a gym, commonly known to students as the \"new gym\", were built. In 1987 there was another extension which added several new rooms to the side of the building, one of which is the current staff room. In 1999 a further extension, known as the Octagon was built.\n\n=== Roselands ===\nRoselands was originally built as a place of residence for the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] community. However, as the number of priests in Roselands diminished, the Jesuits no longer saw fit to occupy the Roselands site and sold off the building to the main school. Roselands has now become the place for the [[Sixth Form]] to study, however some subjects such as science cannot be taught in Roselands since there is no facility to and, as a consequence, some sixth form students have to go to the main building.\n\n=== The Octagon ===\nThe Octagon is a two-story [[Octagon|octagonal]] building on the site which houses the computer suite and the [[Ignatius of Loyola|Loyola]] Library, and was opened in 1999. On the top floor there was an ICT suite which contained 40 computers, as well as various smaller offices dedicated to tasks such as housing the servers and ICT teachers. However, this has since been refurbished again and the upper storey now houses a chapel. On the bottom floor is a library containing a vast array of books primarily for study, but there is a large selection of fiction too. The library is open at lunch time for pupils to study in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=information/octagon|title=Octagon {{!}} St Ignatius College|website=www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n=== CCF hut ===\nWhere the school's [[Combined Cadet Force|Combined Cadet Frce (ccf)]] contingent's training is centred. It is used both for the administration of the contingent and the training of the cadets.\n\n== Religious life ==\nThe college aims to assist each individual pupil in his spiritual development. This spiritual development includes retreats as pupils progress through the school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://teachweb.co.uk/secondary-schools/Enfield-B21/St-Ignatius-College-RC-Boys-SC219.html|title=St Ignatius College RC (Boys), Enfield|website=teachweb.co.uk|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Motto ===\nThe school motto ''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]'' \u2013 meaning \"For the greater glory of God\" \u2013 was abbreviated to AMDG and is still customarily appended to students' essays or homework.\n\n=== Mass ===\n[[File:St Ignatius College chapel, Enfield.jpg|thumb|right|College chapel]]\nThe first formal act of each school day is Mass every morning in the College Chapel before school, when the school day and school community is offered up to God. The whole school meets for Mass at the beginning of each academic year and at the conclusion of each term. All pupils have an opportunity to attend Mass on holy days of obligation and on some other major feasts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=catholic-life/acts-worship|title=Acts of worship {{!}} St Ignatius College|website=www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Morning prayers ===\nAt the beginning of each day at registration, the whole form class says a prayer from the college diary, so pupils are reminded that the work they do is for the greater glory of God (AMDG). Pupils are invited to say the [[Rosary]] during May and October, Advent prayer, and Stations of the Cross during Lent.\n\n=== Chaplaincy team ===\nHelping in all aspects of religious life is the College Chaplain. The Chaplain often celebrates Mass for the school and at special college occasions. Members of the college from various years help with running Masses, for both year groups and the whole school. These boys are called sacristans, and are headed by the master of ceremonies, an upper sixth form student.\n\n==== Chaplaincy groups ====\nThere are four groups that members of the Sixth Form can join. These groups help to run spiritual activities and help to celebrate the Mass. They are:\n* Arrupe \u2013 arrange retreats\n* Gonzaga \u2013 paired reading scheme\n* Loyola \u2013 justice and peace\n* Ogilvie \u2013 [[Extraordinary minister of Holy Communion|Extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion]]\n\n=== Retreat opportunities ===\nThe opportunity for pupils regularly to take part in [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreats]], devised and directed according to their stage at the school, is an essential part of the Jesuit educational ideal. A retreat is a time when, away from their usual environments of home and school, the pupils can reflect on their lives and on their relationships with others and with God. The college offers a sequential programme of retreats, carefully structured in content and style to address the perennial and changing needs of the pupils as they move through the school. Members of Years 7, 9 and 11 have retreat days each year and these take place in the Pastoral Centre, a detached property which stands on the college site. Residential retreats are organised for members of the upper years, Year 10 and the Sixth Form. A variety of centres and formats are used. Recently, these retreats have been held at [[St John's Beaumont]], a Jesuit youth centre in [[Hampstead]], and at the De La Salle centre at [[Kintbury]].\n\n== Awards ==\nAt the College there are a number of awards presented, usually for good behaviour or for exceptional work. These are chiefly:\n*Commendations \u2013 A small certificate that says the name of the pupil and how they attained the award.\n*Merits \u2013 For exceptional work or a greater achievement; these are presented in front of the school.\n\n=== Speech Day ===\nThe college has an annual speech day, normally held around the end of November.<ref>[http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/page_viewer.asp?section=School+Diary&sid=143 School Diary]</ref> At speech day a vast array of prizes are awarded. In years 8 to 11, each class has prizes for general attainment, general effort, and religious education, which are awarded based on their achievements in the previous school year. Also, one pupil from each class in years 8 to 11 is awarded the class prize. For the lower Sixth Form there is a single prize in each subject. There are also 15 college prizes, each of which has its own criteria for winning. The recipients of all of these prizes are determined by the relevant staff.\n\nAt speech day, [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]] certificates are also distributed. Speeches are normally made by the headmaster and the principal guest.\n\n=== Prefecture ===\nWhen students enter the Sixth Form they are given a recommendation from their previous head of year if they should become prefects or not. Prefects are appointed by the Headmaster, in consultation with the Head of Sixth Form and his tutorial staff. At the college, a prefect is identified by his [[maroon (color)|maroon]] tie, while a normal Sixth Form student wears a blue tie.\n\n=== College Captaincy ===\nThe title of College [[School Captain|Captain]] is the highest honour that a student can receive. Before [[Easter]], the current College Captain and his Vice will write up a short-list on those they believe should take over next year. The Headmaster, who selects the Captain and Vice Captains, is not bound by the results of the poll. The Captain and the 2 Vice Captains are announced at the college Mass at the end of the Spring Term. Recently, a new system has been introduced: one college captain, one vice captain, and several \"head prefects\".\n\n== Houses ==\nThe school's forms were formerly based upon ability. However, the forms have since been changed into mixed ability, with some subjects independently adopting a 'set' system. The St Francis Xavier forms were added as commemoration for the College's 125th Anniversary. The forms are named after seven Jesuit martyrs:\n\n*  ''Garnet'', after St [[Thomas Garnet]], SJ (1575\u20131608)\n* ''Southwell'', after St [[Robert Southwell (jesuit)|Robert Southwell]], SJ (1560\u20131595)\n* ''Arrowsmith'', after St [[Edmund Arrowsmith]], SJ (1585\u20131628)\n* ''Campion'', after St [[Edmund Campion]], SJ (1540\u20131581)\n* ''Lewis'', after St [[David Lewis (martyr)|David Lewis]], SJ (1616\u20131679)\n* ''Page'', after Blessed Francis Page, SJ (15?? - 1602)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=about-us/jesuit-institute-and-jesuits-britain|title=The Jesuit Institute and Jesuits in Britain {{!}} St Ignatius College|website=www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n*''Xavier'', after St [[Francis Xavier]], SJ (1506 - 1552) \n\nPupils change forms due to misbehaviour. This can take place at any time the head of year feels necessary but usually happens around in between terms or years. \n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\n=== Publications ===\n==== The Ignatian ====\n''The Ignatian'', the college magazine, is published yearly and features a selection of highlights from the previous school year. Pictures of art and reports on music and sport in the college are normally included, along with the Headmaster's report. It is produced and edited by members of the Sixth Form. It is customary to ask the Art students to produce a piece of artwork that will become the front cover of ''The Ignatian''. The Deputy Head, as editor, will ask students and other sixth form students to write articles that can be included in the magazine. The editors will usually complete the magazine before the start of summer holidays so that when the pupils return the next year they can get a copy.\n\n==== Yearbook ====\nFor the first time in the school's history, in 2006, it was decided to produce a yearbook for the outgoing year 11, with an art pupil being asked to produce its front cover.\n\n==== College newsletter ====\nEvery Half Term a [[newsletter]], summarising the college's achievements for that half term, is published. It includes a list of merits attained for that half term.\n\n=== CCF ===\nThe College has a Contingent of the [[Combined Cadet Force]]. The Contingent has both an [[British Army|Army]] Section and a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) Section. Weekly Section training takes place on Mondays at the College. Cadets also get the chance to attend camps, Field Training Exercises (FTX), Adventurous Training (AT), and courses throughout the UK and occasionally abroad. Courses include flying, parachuting, signalling, catering, physical training instructor (PTI), schoolboy commando course, mountain leader training, and rock climbing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=years-7-11/enrichment|title=Enrichment {{!}} St Ignatius College|website=www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Sports ===\nSports played at the College include:\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}      \n* [[Association football|Football]]\n* [[Rugby union]] {{pad|5ex}} \n* [[Basketball]]\n{{col-break}}      \n* [[Tennis]]\n* [[Cross country running]]{{pad|5ex}}\n* [[Cricket]]\n {{col-break}}\n* [[swimming (sport)|Swimming]]<ref>[http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=information/facilities-hire Facilities for hire]</ref>\n* Cycling\n{{col-end}} \nThe school has a prestigious sporting record, regularly attending sporting tournaments throughout the UK. One notable achievement from one of the tournaments is the under-11's winning a mini-bus for the school. The school recently signed a deal with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] to allow the use of Tottenham's playing fields.\n\n== Old Ignatian Association ==\nFormer pupils of the school are commonly referred to as Old Ignatians. The main objective of the Old Ignatian Association is to serve the interests of the former pupils of the College. They provide spiritual, social, recreational, and sporting facilities so that they may serve the interests of not only the Old Ignatians but also of current pupils.\n\nAlthough having been in existence for many years, the Old Ignatian Association changed dramatically in the early 1960s. Through the efforts of a dedicated and enthusiastic group of Old Ignatians a sports ground was acquired and a pavilion built on a site in [[Woodford, London|Woodford]]. In the 1970s the proposed motorway, the [[M11 motorway|M11]], caused the association to be subject to a compulsory purchase order and they were left without a suitable meeting place throughout the late 1970s.\n\nIn 1999 the Old Ignatians purchased a former sports ground in Turkey Street, Enfield, and made plans to build their new headquarters there. Their plans were to re-establish a social centre and to provide some new sporting facilities that were not available in the Woodford centre. Their plan also was to make sure that the facilities at the new site not only cater to sports-minded people, but the less so as well. In 2002, after obtaining planning permission for the new pavilion, building began. The now completed pavilion named \"The Loyola Ground\" was opened in 2008 and is used by the Association as well as the school for sporting, social, and many other events.\n\n=== Old Ignatian Football Club ===\nThe Old Ignatian Football Club is open to former and present pupils of the College to play football on Saturday afternoons throughout the season. They run 5 teams plus a vets side on a Sunday so every level of ability is catered for. With the new clubhouse completed the OIFC once again had a place they could call home after many years without a base. They now play their home matches on the main pitch as well as sharing the schools bulls cross pitches at the Loyola Ground on Saturday afternoons.\n\n== Discipline ==\n=== History ===\nMost Old Ignatians will recall the form of corporal punishment administered at the school. The cane was never used, instead it was the [[ferula]] (whale bone covered in a heavy rubber called gutta percha) which was administered on both hands, half the awarded strokes on each. Two types of ferula or \"tolly\" were used \u2013 the one mentioned above for the lower school and a longer one for the upper school. In serious cases the punishment would be \"twice six\" on both hands, but administered on separate days on account of the hand becoming numb. The ferula was usually administered in the current technology wing on the bottom floor. Adding psychological to corporal punishment, offenders were given a week to decide when they would receive their ferula, otherwise additional punishment was liable to be added (according to the school rules). [[Corporal punishment]] ended in the early 1990s.\n\n=== Discipline today ===\nNowadays, discipline is in the form of a [[School punishment|detention]] which is 1 hour long and takes place after school with the subject tutor. In extreme circumstances, teachers can issue a 2-hour detention called an SLT detention. For serious offences, pupils can either be placed in Manresa (in-school suspension), or excluded fixed-term (suspension) or full-term (expelled). \n\n<ref>[http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/sites/default/files/Ignatian%20Code%20of%20Conduct%202015%20July_0.pdf Discipline]</ref>\n\n== Curriculum ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n=== Key Stage 3 ===\nAt Key Stage 3 Pupils follow the same subjects for Years 7-9:\n\n{| border=\"5\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"2\"\n| <div align=\"center\">Religious Education</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Music</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">English</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Art</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">History</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Design Technology</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Geography</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">PE</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Computing</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Games</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Mathematics</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">French</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Food Technology</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Spanish</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Science</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Drama</div>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | <div align=\"center\">Latin or Classical Studies</div>\n|}\n{{col-3}}\n\n=== Key Stage 4 ===\nAll pupils must take '''Maths, Science (Double Science), English, Religious Education and Physical Education''' and choose other subjects for their [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]]:<ref>[http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=years-7-11 Years 7-11]</ref>\n{| border=\"5\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"2\"\n| width=\"50%\" | '''Top Band''':\n| width=\"50%\" | '''Main Band''':\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Art</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Art</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">German</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Classical Studies</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Music</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Music</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">History</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">History</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Triple Science</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">ASDAN course</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Latin</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Computer Studies</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Sports\u2019 Science</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Sports\u2019 Science</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">French</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">French</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Technology*</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Technology*</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Geography</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Geography</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Statistics (Only Top Set Maths)</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Capel Manor course</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">English Literature</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">English Literature</div>\n|-\n|\n| <div align=\"center\">Leisure & Tourism</div>\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Technology is split into 3 groups; Resistant Materials, Graphic Products, Food Technology\n{{col-3}}\n=== Key Stage 5 ===\nEntry to the Sixth Form is subject to a satisfactory report from the Year 11 Line Master and an interview with the Head of the Sixth Form.

It was formerly a [[grammar school]], only accepting boys who had passed the [[Eleven plus exam]].\n\n== History ==\nThe school was founded in [[Stamford Hill]], South [[Tottenham]], London, on 10 September 1894. The college and the Jesuit community were initially accommodated in two houses called Morecombe Lodge and Burleigh House, located near [[Tottenham High Road]]. The school originally had only 46 boys, four [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], and a dog in 1894. In 1907 the college was recognised by the Board of Education and began to receive public money towards its support.\n\nFrom the early 1950s the school complement averaged about 700 boys. Its longest serving Headmaster, Fr Guy Brinkworth SJ, retired in 1963. The school remained at Stamford Hill as a grammar school until 1968. The school then became a two-tier, seven-form entry [[comprehensive school]], the lower school being located at the old Cardinal Allen School, which had been there for eight years prior to the school moving there, and the upper school located in Turkey Street, Enfield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=about-us/history-school|title=History of the School {{!}} St Ignatius College|website=www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Front of St Ignatius College, Enfield, Middlesex.png|thumb|200px|right|Turkey Street Building in 2006]]\nIn 1987, the lower and upper schools amalgamated at Turkey Street, a development made possible by a major building programme. The school became grant maintained in 1993 but returned to [[Voluntary aided school|Voluntary Aided]] status in September 1999. At the [[century|centenary]] celebrations in 1994, the newly refurbished chapel was unveiled, and every pupil received a book detailing the history of the school and its past teachers. In 1998 the school started to build the Octagon which houses a computer suite and a library. The building work was completed in 2000 and was handed over to the school later that year. Also in 2000, the newly refurbished Roselands Centre for the Sixth Form was opened. In 2006 the school raised \u00a350,000 through various events held at the school and donations from past pupils. School enrollment has risen to 1,300 pupils. \n\nMichael Blundell became the college's first lay Headmaster when he succeeded Fr Antony Forrester SJ, in 1986. Mr Blundell was in turn succeeded as Headmaster by Paul Adams, who retired in the summer of 2007, and was replaced by John-Paul Morrison, who left the post of headmaster in December 2013. Andrew Dickson took over the post on an interim basis until a replacement for John-Paul Morrison could be found. Kelly took over from Dickson in 2014 and retired from his role in 2016 and was succeeded by Mrs O'Keeffe, the first female headteacher of a Jesuit secondary school in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Loyola Preparatory School==\nIn 1900, the college began a preparatory department. However, in 1944 this preparatory department became Loyola Preparatory School, a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]] boys [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] run by the Jesuits. In 1950, Loyola Preparatory School moved to a site in [[Buckhurst Hill]] in [[Essex]] that was formerly occupied by [[Braeside School, Buckhurst Hill|Braeside School]].<ref>[http://www.loyola.essex.sch.uk/index.php?page=our-100-year-history History] from Loyola.Essex.sch.uk, retrieved 7 August 2017</ref> In 1962, [[Campion School, Hornchurch|Campion School]], a Jesuit secondary school, was opened in [[Hornchurch]], making Loyola Preparatory School a feeder school for both the college and Campion School.\n\nIn 2001, trusteeship of Loyola Preparatory School was given to the [[Diocese of Brentwood]] and as of 2017, Loyola Preparatory School teaches boys from the ages of 3 to 11 and has 190 pupils.<ref>[http://www.isi.net/school/loyola-preparatory-school-6661 Loyola Preparatory School], [[Independent Schools Inspectorate]], retrieved 7 August 2017</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Loyola Preparatory School became the best Under-11 school football team in England by winning the national final of the [[Danone Nations Cup]] at the [[bet365 Stadium]].<ref>Tom Barnes, [http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/15364476.Youngsters_crowned_England__39_s_best_school_football_team/ Loyola Preparatory School in Buckhurst Hill lifts Danone Nations Cup to be crowned best school football team in England] from ''East London and West Essex Guardian'', 22 June 2017, retrieved 7 August 2017</ref>\n\n== School buildings ==\n=== Main building ===\nThe present building was first occupied in January 1968, staff and boys moving from the Stamford Hill site. The main building of the school has since seen improvements made to it such as new extensions. Years 7 to 11 occupy this building. There are three floors, each one holding at least three departments. \n\nOriginally the school only used two floors for years 7 to 11, and the Sixth Form occupied the 3rd floor. However, overcrowding again became a problem and the school acquired the \"Roselands\" building from the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who had a place of residence there. The school also built another floor on top of the current technology wing to serve as the \"first line\" block. In this extension project a section dedicated to the study of music and a gym, commonly known to students as the \"new gym\", were built. In 1987 there was another extension which added several new rooms to the side of the building, one of which is the current staff room. In 1999 a further extension, known as the Octagon was built.\n\n=== Roselands ===\nRoselands was originally built as a place of residence for the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] community. However, as the number of priests in Roselands diminished, the Jesuits no longer saw fit to occupy the Roselands site and sold off the building to the main school. Roselands has now become the place for the [[Sixth Form]] to study, however some subjects such as science cannot be taught in Roselands since there is no facility to and, as a consequence, some sixth form students have to go to the main building.\n\n=== The Octagon ===\nThe Octagon is a two-story [[Octagon|octagonal]] building on the site which houses the computer suite and the [[Ignatius of Loyola|Loyola]] Library, and was opened in 1999. On the top floor there was an ICT suite which contained 40 computers, as well as various smaller offices dedicated to tasks such as housing the servers and ICT teachers. However, this has since been refurbished again and the upper storey now houses a chapel. On the bottom floor is a library containing a vast array of books primarily for study, but there is a large selection of fiction too. The library is open at lunch time for pupils to study in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=information/octagon|title=Octagon {{!}} St Ignatius College|website=www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n=== CCF hut ===\nWhere the school's [[Combined Cadet Force|Combined Cadet Frce (ccf)]] contingent's training is centred. It is used both for the administration of the contingent and the training of the cadets.\n\n== Religious life ==\nThe college aims to assist each individual pupil in his spiritual development. This spiritual development includes retreats as pupils progress through the school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://teachweb.co.uk/secondary-schools/Enfield-B21/St-Ignatius-College-RC-Boys-SC219.html|title=St Ignatius College RC (Boys), Enfield|website=teachweb.co.uk|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Motto ===\nThe school motto ''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]'' \u2013 meaning \"For the greater glory of God\" \u2013 was abbreviated to AMDG and is still customarily appended to students' essays or homework.\n\n=== Mass ===\n[[File:St Ignatius College chapel, Enfield.jpg|thumb|right|College chapel]]\nThe first formal act of each school day is Mass every morning in the College Chapel before school, when the school day and school community is offered up to God. The whole school meets for Mass at the beginning of each academic year and at the conclusion of each term. All pupils have an opportunity to attend Mass on holy days of obligation and on some other major feasts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=catholic-life/acts-worship|title=Acts of worship {{!}} St Ignatius College|website=www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Morning prayers ===\nAt the beginning of each day at registration, the whole form class says a prayer from the college diary, so pupils are reminded that the work they do is for the greater glory of God (AMDG). Pupils are invited to say the [[Rosary]] during May and October, Advent prayer, and Stations of the Cross during Lent.\n\n=== Chaplaincy team ===\nHelping in all aspects of religious life is the College Chaplain. The Chaplain often celebrates Mass for the school and at special college occasions. Members of the college from various years help with running Masses, for both year groups and the whole school. These boys are called sacristans, and are headed by the master of ceremonies, an upper sixth form student.\n\n==== Chaplaincy groups ====\nThere are four groups that members of the Sixth Form can join. These groups help to run spiritual activities and help to celebrate the Mass. They are:\n* Arrupe \u2013 arrange retreats\n* Gonzaga \u2013 paired reading scheme\n* Loyola \u2013 justice and peace\n* Ogilvie \u2013 [[Extraordinary minister of Holy Communion|Extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion]]\n\n=== Retreat opportunities ===\nThe opportunity for pupils regularly to take part in [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreats]], devised and directed according to their stage at the school, is an essential part of the Jesuit educational ideal. A retreat is a time when, away from their usual environments of home and school, the pupils can reflect on their lives and on their relationships with others and with God. The college offers a sequential programme of retreats, carefully structured in content and style to address the perennial and changing needs of the pupils as they move through the school. Members of Years 7, 9 and 11 have retreat days each year and these take place in the Pastoral Centre, a detached property which stands on the college site. Residential retreats are organised for members of the upper years, Year 10 and the Sixth Form. A variety of centres and formats are used. Recently, these retreats have been held at [[St John's Beaumont]], a Jesuit youth centre in [[Hampstead]], and at the De La Salle centre at [[Kintbury]].\n\n== Awards ==\nAt the College there are a number of awards presented, usually for good behaviour or for exceptional work. These are chiefly:\n*Commendations \u2013 A small certificate that says the name of the pupil and how they attained the award.\n*Merits \u2013 For exceptional work or a greater achievement; these are presented in front of the school.\n\n=== Speech Day ===\nThe college has an annual speech day, normally held around the end of November.<ref>[http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/page_viewer.asp?section=School+Diary&sid=143 School Diary]</ref> At speech day a vast array of prizes are awarded. In years 8 to 11, each class has prizes for general attainment, general effort, and religious education, which are awarded based on their achievements in the previous school year. Also, one pupil from each class in years 8 to 11 is awarded the class prize. For the lower Sixth Form there is a single prize in each subject. There are also 15 college prizes, each of which has its own criteria for winning. The recipients of all of these prizes are determined by the relevant staff.\n\nAt speech day, [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]] certificates are also distributed. Speeches are normally made by the headmaster and the principal guest.\n\n=== Prefecture ===\nWhen students enter the Sixth Form they are given a recommendation from their previous head of year if they should become prefects or not. Prefects are appointed by the Headmaster, in consultation with the Head of Sixth Form and his tutorial staff. At the college, a prefect is identified by his [[maroon (color)|maroon]] tie, while a normal Sixth Form student wears a blue tie.\n\n=== College Captaincy ===\nThe title of College [[School Captain|Captain]] is the highest honour that a student can receive. Before [[Easter]], the current College Captain and his Vice will write up a short-list on those they believe should take over next year. The Headmaster, who selects the Captain and Vice Captains, is not bound by the results of the poll. The Captain and the 2 Vice Captains are announced at the college Mass at the end of the Spring Term. Recently, a new system has been introduced: one college captain, one vice captain, and several \"head prefects\".\n\n== Houses ==\nThe school's forms were formerly based upon ability. However, the forms have since been changed into mixed ability, with some subjects independently adopting a 'set' system. The St Francis Xavier forms were added as commemoration for the College's 125th Anniversary. The forms are named after seven Jesuit martyrs:\n\n*  ''Garnet'', after St [[Thomas Garnet]], SJ (1575\u20131608)\n* ''Southwell'', after St [[Robert Southwell (jesuit)|Robert Southwell]], SJ (1560\u20131595)\n* ''Arrowsmith'', after St [[Edmund Arrowsmith]], SJ (1585\u20131628)\n* ''Campion'', after St [[Edmund Campion]], SJ (1540\u20131581)\n* ''Lewis'', after St [[David Lewis (martyr)|David Lewis]], SJ (1616\u20131679)\n* ''Page'', after Blessed Francis Page, SJ (15?? - 1602)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=about-us/jesuit-institute-and-jesuits-britain|title=The Jesuit Institute and Jesuits in Britain {{!}} St Ignatius College|website=www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n*''Xavier'', after St [[Francis Xavier]], SJ (1506 - 1552) \n\nPupils change forms due to misbehaviour. This can take place at any time the head of year feels necessary but usually happens around in between terms or years. \n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\n=== Publications ===\n==== The Ignatian ====\n''The Ignatian'', the college magazine, is published yearly and features a selection of highlights from the previous school year. Pictures of art and reports on music and sport in the college are normally included, along with the Headmaster's report. It is produced and edited by members of the Sixth Form. It is customary to ask the Art students to produce a piece of artwork that will become the front cover of ''The Ignatian''. The Deputy Head, as editor, will ask students and other sixth form students to write articles that can be included in the magazine. The editors will usually complete the magazine before the start of summer holidays so that when the pupils return the next year they can get a copy.\n\n==== Yearbook ====\nFor the first time in the school's history, in 2006, it was decided to produce a yearbook for the outgoing year 11, with an art pupil being asked to produce its front cover.\n\n==== College newsletter ====\nEvery Half Term a [[newsletter]], summarising the college's achievements for that half term, is published. It includes a list of merits attained for that half term.\n\n=== CCF ===\nThe College has a Contingent of the [[Combined Cadet Force]]. The Contingent has both an [[British Army|Army]] Section and a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) Section. Weekly Section training takes place on Mondays at the College. Cadets also get the chance to attend camps, Field Training Exercises (FTX), Adventurous Training (AT), and courses throughout the UK and occasionally abroad. Courses include flying, parachuting, signalling, catering, physical training instructor (PTI), schoolboy commando course, mountain leader training, and rock climbing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=years-7-11/enrichment|title=Enrichment {{!}} St Ignatius College|website=www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Sports ===\nSports played at the College include:\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}      \n* [[Association football|Football]]\n* [[Rugby union]] {{pad|5ex}} \n* [[Basketball]]\n{{col-break}}      \n* [[Tennis]]\n* [[Cross country running]]{{pad|5ex}}\n* [[Cricket]]\n {{col-break}}\n* [[swimming (sport)|Swimming]]<ref>[http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=information/facilities-hire Facilities for hire]</ref>\n* Cycling\n{{col-end}} \nThe school has a prestigious sporting record, regularly attending sporting tournaments throughout the UK. One notable achievement from one of the tournaments is the under-11's winning a mini-bus for the school. The school recently signed a deal with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] to allow the use of Tottenham's playing fields.\n\n== Old Ignatian Association ==\nFormer pupils of the school are commonly referred to as Old Ignatians. The main objective of the Old Ignatian Association is to serve the interests of the former pupils of the College. They provide spiritual, social, recreational, and sporting facilities so that they may serve the interests of not only the Old Ignatians but also of current pupils.\n\nAlthough having been in existence for many years, the Old Ignatian Association changed dramatically in the early 1960s. Through the efforts of a dedicated and enthusiastic group of Old Ignatians a sports ground was acquired and a pavilion built on a site in [[Woodford, London|Woodford]]. In the 1970s the proposed motorway, the [[M11 motorway|M11]], caused the association to be subject to a compulsory purchase order and they were left without a suitable meeting place throughout the late 1970s.\n\nIn 1999 the Old Ignatians purchased a former sports ground in Turkey Street, Enfield, and made plans to build their new headquarters there. Their plans were to re-establish a social centre and to provide some new sporting facilities that were not available in the Woodford centre. Their plan also was to make sure that the facilities at the new site not only cater to sports-minded people, but the less so as well. In 2002, after obtaining planning permission for the new pavilion, building began. The now completed pavilion named \"The Loyola Ground\" was opened in 2008 and is used by the Association as well as the school for sporting, social, and many other events.\n\n=== Old Ignatian Football Club ===\nThe Old Ignatian Football Club is open to former and present pupils of the College to play football on Saturday afternoons throughout the season. They run 5 teams plus a vets side on a Sunday so every level of ability is catered for. With the new clubhouse completed the OIFC once again had a place they could call home after many years without a base. They now play their home matches on the main pitch as well as sharing the schools bulls cross pitches at the Loyola Ground on Saturday afternoons.\n\n== Discipline ==\n=== History ===\nMost Old Ignatians will recall the form of corporal punishment administered at the school. The cane was never used, instead it was the [[ferula]] (whale bone covered in a heavy rubber called gutta percha) which was administered on both hands, half the awarded strokes on each. Two types of ferula or \"tolly\" were used \u2013 the one mentioned above for the lower school and a longer one for the upper school. In serious cases the punishment would be \"twice six\" on both hands, but administered on separate days on account of the hand becoming numb. The ferula was usually administered in the current technology wing on the bottom floor. Adding psychological to corporal punishment, offenders were given a week to decide when they would receive their ferula, otherwise additional punishment was liable to be added (according to the school rules). [[Corporal punishment]] ended in the early 1990s.\n\n=== Discipline today ===\nNowadays, discipline is in the form of a [[School punishment|detention]] which is 1 hour long and takes place after school with the subject tutor. In extreme circumstances, teachers can issue a 2 hour detention called an SLT detention. For serious offences, pupils can either be placed in Manresa (in-school suspension), or excluded fixed-term (suspension) or full-term (expelled). \n\n<ref>[http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/sites/default/files/Ignatian%20Code%20of%20Conduct%202015%20July_0.pdf Discipline]</ref>\n\n== Curriculum ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n=== Key Stage 3 ===\nAt Key Stage 3 Pupils follow the same subjects for Years 7-9:\n\n{| border=\"5\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"2\"\n| <div align=\"center\">Religious Education</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Music</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">English</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Art</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">History</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Design Technology</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Geography</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">PE</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Computing</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Games</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Mathematics</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">French</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Food Technology</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Spanish</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Science</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Drama</div>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | <div align=\"center\">Latin or Classical Studies</div>\n|}\n{{col-3}}\n\n=== Key Stage 4 ===\nAll pupils must take '''Maths, Science (Double Science), English, Religious Education and Physical Education''' and choose other subjects for their [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]]:<ref>[http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk/?q=years-7-11 Years 7-11]</ref>\n{| border=\"5\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"2\"\n| width=\"50%\" | '''Top Band''':\n| width=\"50%\" | '''Main Band''':\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Art</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Art</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">German</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Classical Studies</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Music</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Music</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">History</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">History</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Triple Science</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">ASDAN course</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Latin</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Computer Studies</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Sports\u2019 Science</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Sports\u2019 Science</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">French</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">French</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Technology*</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Technology*</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Geography</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Geography</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">Statistics (Only Top Set Maths)</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">Capel Manor course</div>\n|-\n| <div align=\"center\">English Literature</div>\n| <div align=\"center\">English Literature</div>\n|-\n|\n| <div align=\"center\">Leisure & Tourism</div>\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Technology is split into 3 groups; Resistant Materials, Graphic Products, Food Technology\n{{col-3}}\n=== Key Stage 5 ===\nEntry to the Sixth Form is subject to a satisfactory report from the Year 11 Line Master and an interview with the Head of the Sixth Form.

Several types of mathematical description can be distinguished: [[Concentration#Mass concentration|mass concentration]], [[Concentration#Molar concentration|molar concentration]], [[Concentration#Number concentration|number concentration]], and [[Concentration#Volume concentration|volume concentration]].<ref name=\"goldbook\">{{GoldBookRef | file = C01222 | title = concentration}}</ref> A concentration can be any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently solutes and solvents in [[solution]]s. The molar (amount) concentration has variants such as [[normal concentration]] and [[osmotic concentration]].\n\n==Qualitative description==\n\n[[Image:Dilution-concentration simple example.jpg|frame|right|These glasses containing red dye demonstrate qualitative changes in concentration. The solutions on the left are more dilute, compared to the more concentrated solutions on the right.]]\n\nOften in informal, non-technical language, concentration is described in a [[qualitative data|qualitative]] way, through the use of adjectives such as \"dilute\" for solutions of relatively low concentration and \"concentrated\" for solutions of relatively high concentration. To '''concentrate''' a solution, one must add more [[solution|solute]] (for example, alcohol), or reduce the amount of [[solvent]] (for example, water). By contrast, to '''dilute''' a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute. Unless two substances are [[miscible]], there exists a concentration at which no further solute will dissolve in a solution. At this point, the solution is said to be [[Saturated solution|saturated]]. If additional solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve, except in certain circumstances, when [[supersaturation]] may occur. Instead, [[Phase (matter)#Phase separation|phase separation]] will occur, leading to coexisting phases, either completely separated or mixed as a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]. The point of saturation depends on many variables such as ambient temperature and the precise chemical nature of the solvent and solute.\n\nConcentrations are often called '''levels''', reflecting the mental [[schema (psychology)|schema]] of [[ordinate|levels on the vertical axis]] of a [[chart|graph]], which can be [[height|high or low]] (for example, \"high serum levels of bilirubin\" are concentrations of [[bilirubin]] in the [[serum (blood)|blood serum]] that are greater [[Reference ranges for blood tests#Bilirubin reference ranges|than normal]]).\n\n==Quantitative notation==\n\nThere are four quantities that describe concentration:\n\n===Mass concentration===\n{{main|Mass concentration (chemistry)}}\n\nThe mass concentration <math>\\rho_i</math> is defined as the [[mass]] of a constituent <math>m_i</math> divided by the volume of the mixture <math>V</math>:\n\n:<math>\\rho_i = \\frac {m_i}{V}.</math>\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is kg/m<sup>3</sup> (equal to g/L).\n\n===Molar concentration===\n{{main|Molar concentration}}\n\nThe molar concentration <math>c_i</math> is defined as the [[amount of substance|amount]] of a constituent <math>n_i</math> (in moles) divided by the volume of the mixture <math>V</math>:\n\n:<math>c_i = \\frac {n_i}{V}.</math>\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is mol/m<sup>3</sup>.

Its {{convert|17|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} site was obtained in a land exchange with the [[Navajo Nation]]. The city is perched atop Manson Mesa at an elevation of {{convert|4300|ft|m}} above sea level and {{convert|600|ft|m}} above [[Lake Powell]].\n\nThe city was originally called Government Camp, but was later named for John C. Page, Commissioner of the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]], 1936-1943.\n\nAfter the dam was completed in the 1960s, and was officially incorporated (March 1, 1975), the city grew steadily to today's population of over 7,000. Because of the new roads and bridge built for use during construction, it has become the gateway to the [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]] and Lake Powell, attracting more than 3 million visitors per year. Page is also the home of two of the largest electrical generation units in the western United States. Glen Canyon Dam has a 1,288,000-kilowatt capacity when fully online. The other [[power plant]] to the southeast is the [[Navajo Generating Station]], a coal-fired steam plant with an output capability of 2,250,000 kilowatts.\n\n==Geography==\nPage is located at {{coord|36|54|51|N|111|27|35|W|type:city}} (36.914296, -111.459717).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|16.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|16.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|km2}}, or 0.12%, is water.

Its {{convert|17|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} site was obtained in a land exchange with the [[Navajo Nation]]. The city is perched atop Manson Mesa at an elevation of {{convert|4300|ft|m}} above sea level and {{convert|600|ft|m}} above [[Lake Powell]].\n\nThe city was originally called Government Camp, but was later named for John C. Page, Commissioner of the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]], 1936-1943.\n\nAfter the dam was completed in the 1960s, and was officially incorporated (March 1, 1975), the city grew steadily to today's population of over 7,000. Because of the new roads and bridge built for use during construction, it has become the gateway to the [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]] and Lake Powell, attracting more than 3 million visitors per year. Page is also the home of two of the largest electrical generation units in the western United States. Glen Canyon Dam has a 1,288,000-kilowatt capacity when fully online. The other [[power plant]] to the southeast is the [[Navajo Generating Station]], a coal-fired steam plant with an output capability of 2,250,000 kilowatts.\n\n==Geography==\nPage is located at {{coord|36|54|51|N|111|27|35|W|type:city}} (36.914296, -111.459717).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|16.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|16.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|km2}}, or 0.12%, is water.
