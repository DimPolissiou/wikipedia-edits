A few minor references to Uther appear in [[Old Welsh language|Old Welsh]] [[Medieval Welsh literature|poems]], but his biography was first written down by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), and Geoffrey's account of the character was used in most later versions. He is a fairly ambiguous individual throughout the literature, but is described as a strong king and a defender of the people.\n\nAccording to [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]], [[Merlin]] magically disguises Uther to look like his enemy [[Gorlois]], enabling Uther to sleep with Gorlois' wife Lady [[Igraine]]. Thus Arthur, \"the once and future king\", is an illegitimate child (though later legend, as found in [[Thomas Malory|Malory]], emphasises that the conception occurred after Gorlois's death and that he was legitimated by Uther's subsequent marriage to Igraine<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/MaloryWks2|title=Morte d \u00c0rthur|last=Malory|first=Thomas|date=1997}}</ref>). This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther's troops dispatch Gorlois. The theme of [[illegitimacy|illegitimate conception]] is repeated in Arthur's siring of [[Mordred]] by his own half-sister [[Morgause]] in the 13th century ad French prose cycles, which was invented by them; it is Mordred who mortally wounds [[King Arthur]] in the [[Battle of Camlann]].\n\n==Epithet==\nUther's epithet ''Pendragon'' (composed of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pen'', \"head, chief, top\" and ''[[dragon]]'', \"dragon; [[warrior]]\"; borrowed from the Latin word {{lang|la|drac\u014d}}, plural {{lang|la|drac\u014dn\u0113s}}, \"dragon[s]\") literally means \"Chief-Dragon\" or \"Head-Dragon\", but in a figurative sense, \"chief leader\", \"chief of warriors\", \"commander-in-chief\", \"generalissimo\", or \"chief governor\".<ref>Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru, University of Wales Press, Vol III, 1994, p. 2726-2739, \"pen\", \"pendragon\"; Vol I, 1963 p. 1081, \"dragon\".</ref><ref name=\"Bromwich512\">Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 512\u2013513.</ref> The name was misinterpreted by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' to mean \"dragon's head\".<ref name=\"Bromwich512\"/> According to Geoffrey and works based on his version, Uther acquired the epithet when he witnessed a portentous [[dragon]]-shaped comet, which inspired him to use dragons on his [[flag|standards]]. According to [[Robert de Boron]]<ref>de Boron, Robert. ''Merlin and the Grail''. Tr. Nigel Bryant. Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2001.</ref> and the cycles based on his work, it was Uther's older brother (elsewhere called [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]]) who saw the comet and received the name \"Pendragon\", Uther taking his epithet after his death.\n\n==Early Welsh poetry==\nThough the Welsh tradition of the Arthurian legend is fragmentary, some material exists through the [[Welsh Triads]] and various poems. Uther appears in these fragments, where he is associated with Arthur and, in some cases, even appears as his father.\n\nHe is mentioned in the circa-10th-century Arthurian poem \"[[Pa gur]] yv y porthaur?\" (\"What man is the gatekeeper?\"), where it is only said of him that [[Mabon ap Modron|Mabon son of Modron]] is his servant. He is also memorialised with \"The Death-song of Uther Pen\" from the ''[[Book of Taliesin]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/t48.html \"The death-song of Uther Pendragon\"]</ref> The latter includes a reference to Arthur, so the marginal addition of \"dragon\" to Uther's name is probably justified. \"The Colloquy of Arthur and the Eagle,\" a modern manuscript from the 16th century but believed to have originated from the 13th century, mentions another son of Uther named Madoc, the father of Arthur's nephew [[Eliwlod]].<ref name=\"Bromwich512\"/>\n\nIn Triad 28, Uthyr is named the creator of one of the Three Great Enchantments of the Island of Britain, which he taught to the wizard [[Menw]].<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/triads1.html The Hergest Triads]</ref> Since Menw is a shapeshifter according to ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', it might be that Uther was one as well. If this is so, it opens up the possibility that Geoffrey of Monmouth's narrative about Uther impregnating Igerna with [[Merlin]]'s help (see below) was taken from a Welsh legend where Uthyr changed his own shape, Merlin possibly being added to the story by Geoffrey.<ref>Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 56</ref>\n\nUthyr's other reference, Triad 51, however, shows influence from Geoffrey's ''Historia''. It follows Geoffrey's description of Uther as son of [[Constantine III (usurper)#Legend|Constantine III]], now called \"Custennin the Blessed\", and brother of both [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] (\"Emrys Wledig\") and [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans II]] (\"Custennin the Younger\").<ref>Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', pp. 132\u2013133</ref>\n\n==''Historia Regum Britanniae''==\n[[File:History of the Kings (f.72) Uthr Bendragon.jpg|thumb|left|Uther Pendragon in a crude illustration from a 15th-century Welsh version of ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'']]\nUther is best known from Geoffrey's ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' (1136) where he is the youngest son of King of Britannia, Constantine III. His eldest brother Constans succeeds to the throne on their father's death, but is murdered at the instigation of his adviser [[Vortigern]], who seizes the throne. Uther and his other brother, [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]], still children, flee to [[Brittany]]. Vortigern makes an alliance with the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] under [[Hengest|Hengist]], but it goes disastrously wrong. Aurelius and Uther return, now adults. Aurelius burns Vortigern in his castle and becomes king.\n\nWith Aurelius on the throne, Uther leads his brother in arms to [[Celtic Ireland|Ireland]] to help [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] bring the stones of [[Stonehenge]] from there to Britain. Later, while Aurelius is ill, Uther leads his army against Vortigern's son Paschent and his Saxon allies. On the way to the battle, he sees a comet in the shape of a dragon, which Merlin interprets as presaging Aurelius's death and Uther's glorious future. Uther wins the battle and takes the epithet \"Pendragon\", and returns to find that Aurelius has been poisoned by an assassin. He becomes king and orders the construction of two gold dragons, one of which he uses as his standard. \n\nHe secures Britain's frontiers and quells Saxon uprisings with the aids of his retainers, one of whom is [[Gorlois]], [[Duke of Cornwall]]. At a banquet celebrating their victories, Uther becomes obsessively enamoured of Gorlois' wife Igerna (Igraine), and a war ensues between Uther and his vassal. Gorlois sends Igerna to the impregnable castle of [[Tintagel]] for protection while he himself is besieged by Uther in another town. Uther consults with Merlin who uses his magic to transform the king into the likeness of Gorlois and thus gain access to Igerna at Tintagel. He spends the night with her and they conceive Arthur, but the next morning it is discovered that Gorlois had been killed. Uther marries Igerna and they have a daughter called Anna (in later romances she is called [[Morgause]] and is usually Igerna's daughter by her previous marriage). Morgause later marries [[King Lot]] and becomes the mother of [[Gawain]] and [[Mordred]].\n\nUther later falls ill and the wars begin to go badly against the Saxons. He insists on leading his army himself, propped up on his horse. He defeats Hengist's son [[Octa of Kent|Octa]] at [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]), despite the Saxons calling him the \"Half-Dead King\". However, the Saxons soon contrive his death by poisoning a spring which he drinks from near Verulamium.<ref>[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 6#5|6.5\u20139]], [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8#1|8.1\u201324]]</ref>\n\nUther's family is based on some historical figures; Constantine on the historical Constantine III, an [[Roman usurper|usurper]] claimant to the Roman throne from 407\u2013411, and Constans on his son. Aurelius Ambrosius is Ambrosius Aurelianus, mentioned by [[Gildas]], though his connection to Constantine and Constans is unrecorded.\n\n==Other medieval literature==\nIn [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''[[Merlin (poem)|Merlin]]'' Uther Pendragon kills Hengist after an assassination attempt by the Saxon leader and Merlin creates the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] for him. In the ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Prose Lancelot]]'' Uther Pendragon claims to have been born in [[Bourges]]. He takes an army to [[Brittany]] to fight against King [[Claudas]] of Bourges, a situation resembling that of the historical ruler [[Riothamus]] who went to Brittany to fight ravagers based in Bourges.\n\nThere is an alternative account of Uther Pendragon's background in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]''. A certain Mazad\u00e2n went with a fairy named Terdelaschoye to the land of Feimurg\u00e2n. (This looks like a garbling of some source that told of Mazad\u00e2n's alliance with the [[Morgan the Fay|Fay Morgan]] in Terre de la Joye; the \"Land of Joy\".) Mazad\u00e2n becomes father of two sons, Lazaliez and Brickus. Brickus becomes father of Utepandrag\u00fbn, father of Arthur, while the elder son, Lazaliez, becomes father of Gandin of [[Anjou]], father of Gahmuret, father of Parzival ([[Percival]]). Uther Pendragon and Arthur here appear as the scions of the junior branch of an unattested House of [[Anjou]]. In some early German literature, believed to have relied on some now lost Celtic material, Uther was sometimes said to have been descended from fairies. It may have been meant to explain Arthur\u2019s connection with Avalon. Since according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Caliburn was a gift from Avalon, and Arthur was taken to Avalon to be healed. Layamon also said that, Arthur was given various blessings by fairies in his Brut. \n\nUther also appears in the [[chivalric romance]] ''[[Sir Cleges]]'' as the king to whom Sir Cleges brings the Christmas cherries, obtained by miracle.<ref>Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England''. New York Burt Franklin, 1963. p.79.</ref>\n\n==Modern works==\n[[File:Pelleas and Igraine.jpg|thumb|Uther, on horseback and disguised as Pelleas, watches [[Igraine]] picking flowers in ''Uther and Igraine'' by [[Warwick Deeping]], illustrated by [[Wladyslaw T. Benda]]]]\n\nUther Pendragon remains a widely used character in modern [[List of books about King Arthur|Arthurian literature]] and other fiction. \n\n*In [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Uther the Conqueror is the Norman King of England.\n*[[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]]'s first two books in her Arthurian saga, ''[[The Crystal Cave]]'' and ''[[The Hollow Hills]]'', feature Uther Pendragon as [[Merlin]]'s uncle, Merlin being his brother [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Ambrosius]]' illegitimate son. Uther is depicted as a mostly decent but rather oversexed character, who becomes impotent in later life because of a groin injury, a [[Fisher King]] figure. \n*In [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[The Warlord Chronicles]]'', Uther is the King of [[Dumnonia]] as well as the High King of Britain ruling from [[Dumnonia]]. In these novels, Arthur is his illegitimate son and Morgan is his illegitimate daughter. Cornwell's Uther is highly sceptical of Christianity.\n*In [[Jack Whyte]]'s ''[[The Camulod Chronicles]]'', Uther is King of the Pendragon, the Celtic people of South Cambria, cousin to Caius Merlyn Britannicus and Ambrose Ambrosianus Britannicus. Whyte's novel ''Uther'', written in 2000, revolves around a fictionalised version of Uther's life.\n*In contrast to traditional versions, [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s ''[[Pendragon Cycle]]'' makes Uther's brother [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius]], whose widow ([[Igraine|Ygerna]]) he marries, Arthur's true father.\n*In [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[Mists of Avalon]]'', Uther is the nephew of [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelianus]] instead of his brother; while Aurelianus is the son of a [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]], Uther has no Roman blood. \n*In [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]]'s ''[[The Last Legion]]'', Uther is himself the last Roman Emperor, [[Romulus Augustus]]. While the real Romulus Augustus disappeared from history after being deposed by [[Goths]], in the novel he escapes to Britain, where he adopts the name Pendragon and eventually sires Arthur.\n*In D. J. MacHale's ''Pendragon'' series, the main character, Bobby Pendragon, is the reincarnation of either Uther or his son Arthur.\n*In [[John Boorman]]'s film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'', [[Gabriel Byrne]] plays an ambitious but somewhat obtuse Uther Pendragon, whose uncontrollable lust for Igrayne, while necessary for the birth of Arthur, proves also his own undoing.\n*In the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'', Uther, played by [[Anthony Head]], has banned magic in Camelot and slaughtered any who openly practise the art. It is revealed his wife Ygraine was unable to conceive, so [[Nimueh]], a sorceress and friend, helped in the conception of Arthur. However, to keep balance in the world, a life had to be taken in exchange. Thus, Ygraine died at Arthur's birth, and Uther's guilt spurred him to purge all magic from Camelot. His wanton cruelty eventually causes his ward [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana]], who possesses magic herself, to turn against him.

A few minor references to Uther appear in [[Old Welsh language|Old Welsh]] [[Medieval Welsh literature|poems]], but his biography was first written down by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), and Geoffrey's account of the character was used in most later versions. He is a fairly ambiguous individual throughout the literature, but is described as a strong king and a defender of the people.\n\nAccording to [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]], [[Merlin]] magically disguises Uther to look like his enemy [[Gorlois]], enabling Uther to sleep with Gorlois' wife Lady [[Igraine]]. Thus Arthur, \"the once and future king\", is an illegitimate child (though later legend, as found in [[Thomas Malory|Malory]], emphasises that the conception occurred after Gorlois's death and that he was legitimated by Uther's subsequent marriage to Igraine<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/MaloryWks2|title=Morte d \u00c0rthur|last=Malory|first=Thomas|date=1997}}</ref>). This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther's troops dispatch Gorlois. The theme of [[illegitimacy|illegitimate conception]] is repeated in Arthur's siring of [[Mordred]] by his own half-sister [[Morgause]] in the 13th century ad French prose cycles, which was invented by them; it is Mordred who mortally wounds [[King Arthur]] in the [[Battle of Camlann]].\n\n==Epithet==\nUther's epithet ''Pendragon'' (composed of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pen'', \"head, chief, top\" and ''[[dragon]]'', \"dragon; [[warrior]]\"; borrowed from the Latin word {{lang|la|drac\u014d}}, plural {{lang|la|drac\u014dn\u0113s}}, \"dragon[s]\") literally means \"Chief-Dragon\" or \"Head-Dragon\", but in a figurative sense, \"chief leader\", \"chief of warriors\", \"commander-in-chief\", \"generalissimo\", or \"chief governor\".<ref>Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru, University of Wales Press, Vol III, 1994, p. 2726-2739, \"pen\", \"pendragon\"; Vol I, 1963 p. 1081, \"dragon\".</ref><ref name=\"Bromwich512\">Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 512\u2013513.</ref> The name was misinterpreted by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' to mean \"dragon's head\".<ref name=\"Bromwich512\"/> According to Geoffrey and works based on his version, Uther acquired the epithet when he witnessed a portentous [[dragon]]-shaped comet, which inspired him to use dragons on his [[flag|standards]]. According to [[Robert de Boron]]<ref>de Boron, Robert. ''Merlin and the Grail''. Tr. Nigel Bryant. Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2001.</ref> and the cycles based on his work, it was Uther's older brother (elsewhere called [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]]) who saw the comet and received the name \"Pendragon\", Uther taking his epithet after his death.\n\n==Early Welsh poetry==\nThough the Welsh tradition of the Arthurian legend is fragmentary, some material exists through the [[Welsh Triads]] and various poems. Uther appears in these fragments, where he is associated with Arthur and, in some cases, even appears as his father.\n\nHe is mentioned in the circa-10th-century Arthurian poem \"[[Pa gur]] yv y porthaur?\" (\"What man is the gatekeeper?\"), where it is only said of him that [[Mabon ap Modron|Mabon son of Modron]] is his servant. He is also memorialised with \"The Death-song of Uther Pen\" from the ''[[Book of Taliesin]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/t48.html \"The death-song of Uther Pendragon\"]</ref> The latter includes a reference to Arthur, so the marginal addition of \"dragon\" to Uther's name is probably justified. \"The Colloquy of Arthur and the Eagle,\" a modern manuscript from the 16th century but believed to have originated from the 13th century, mentions another son of Uther named Madoc, the father of Arthur's nephew [[Eliwlod]].<ref name=\"Bromwich512\"/>\n\nIn Triad 28, Uthyr is named the creator of one of the Three Great Enchantments of the Island of Britain, which he taught to the wizard [[Menw]].<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/triads1.html The Hergest Triads]</ref> Since Menw is a shapeshifter according to ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', it might be that Uther was one as well. If this is so, it opens up the possibility that Geoffrey of Monmouth's narrative about Uther impregnating Igerna with [[Merlin]]'s help (see below) was taken from a Welsh legend where Uthyr changed his own shape, Merlin possibly being added to the story by Geoffrey.<ref>Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 56</ref>\n\nUthyr's other reference, Triad 51, however, shows influence from Geoffrey's ''Historia''. It follows Geoffrey's description of Uther as son of [[Constantine III (usurper)#Legend|Constantine III]], now called \"Custennin the Blessed\", and brother of both [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] (\"Emrys Wledig\") and [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans II]] (\"Custennin the Younger\").<ref>Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', pp. 132\u2013133</ref>\n\n==''Historia Regum Britanniae''==\n[[File:History of the Kings (f.72) Uthr Bendragon.jpg|thumb|left|Uther Pendragon in a crude illustration from a 15th-century Welsh version of ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'']]\nUther is best known from Geoffrey's ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' (1136) where he is the youngest son of King of Britannia, Constantine III. His eldest brother Constans succeeds to the throne on their father's death, but is murdered at the instigation of his adviser [[Vortigern]], who seizes the throne. Uther and his other brother, [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]], still children, flee to [[Brittany]]. Vortigern makes an alliance with the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] under [[Hengest|Hengist]], but it goes disastrously wrong. Aurelius and Uther return, now adults. Aurelius burns Vortigern in his castle and becomes king.\n\nWith Aurelius on the throne, Uther leads his brother in arms to [[Celtic Ireland|Ireland]] to help [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] bring the stones of [[Stonehenge]] from there to Britain. Later, while Aurelius is ill, Uther leads his army against Vortigern's son Paschent and his Saxon allies. On the way to the battle, he sees a comet in the shape of a dragon, which Merlin interprets as presaging Aurelius's death and Uther's glorious future. Uther wins the battle and takes the epithet \"Pendragon\", and returns to find that Aurelius has been poisoned by an assassin. He becomes king and orders the construction of two gold dragons, one of which he uses as his standard. \n\nHe secures Britain's frontiers and quells Saxon uprisings with the aids of his retainers, one of whom is [[Gorlois]], [[Duke of Cornwall]]. At a banquet celebrating their victories, Uther becomes obsessively enamoured of Gorlois' wife Igerna (Igraine), and a war ensues between Uther and his vassal. Gorlois sends Igerna to the impregnable castle of [[Tintagel]] for protection while he himself is besieged by Uther in another town. Uther consults with Merlin who uses his magic to transform the king into the likeness of Gorlois and thus gain access to Igerna at Tintagel. He spends the night with her and they conceive Arthur, but the next morning it is discovered that Gorlois had been killed. Uther marries Igerna and they have a daughter called Anna (in later romances she is called [[Morgause]] and is usually Igerna's daughter by her previous marriage). Morgause later marries [[King Lot]] and becomes the mother of [[Gawain]] and [[Mordred]].\n\nUther later falls ill and the wars begin to go badly against the Saxons. He insists on leading his army himself, propped up on his horse. He defeats Hengist's son [[Octa of Kent|Octa]] at [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]), despite the Saxons calling him the \"Half-Dead King\". However, the Saxons soon contrive his death by poisoning a spring which he drinks from near Verulamium.<ref>[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 6#5|6.5\u20139]], [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8#1|8.1\u201324]]</ref>\n\nUther's family is based on some historical figures; Constantine on the historical Constantine III, an [[Roman usurper|usurper]] claimant to the Roman throne from 407\u2013411, and Constans on his son. Aurelius Ambrosius is Ambrosius Aurelianus, mentioned by [[Gildas]], though his connection to Constantine and Constans is unrecorded.\n\n==Other medieval literature==\nIn [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''[[Merlin (poem)|Merlin]]'' Uther Pendragon kills Hengist after an assassination attempt by the Saxon leader and Merlin creates the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] for him. In the ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Prose Lancelot]]'' Uther Pendragon claims to have been born in [[Bourges]]. He takes an army to [[Brittany]] to fight against King [[Claudas]] of Bourges, a situation resembling that of the historical ruler [[Riothamus]] who went to Brittany to fight ravagers based in Bourges.\n\nThere is an alternative account of Uther Pendragon's background in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]''. A certain Mazad\u00e2n went with a fairy named Terdelaschoye to the land of Feimurg\u00e2n. (This looks like a garbling of some source that told of Mazad\u00e2n's alliance with the [[Morgan the Fay|Fay Morgan]] in Terre de la Joye; the \"Land of Joy\".) Mazad\u00e2n becomes father of two sons, Lazaliez and Brickus. Brickus becomes father of Utepandrag\u00fbn, father of Arthur, while the elder son, Lazaliez, becomes father of Gandin of [[Anjou]], father of Gahmuret, father of Parzival ([[Percival]]). Uther Pendragon and Arthur here appear as the scions of the junior branch of an unattested House of [[Anjou]]. In some early German literature, believed to have relied on some now lost Celtic material, Uther was sometimes said to have been descended from fairies. It may have been meant to explain Arthur\u2019s connection with Avalon. Since according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Caliburn was a gift from Avalon, and Arthur was taken to Avalon to be healed. Layamon also said that, Arthur was given various blessings by fairies in his Brut. \n\nUther also appears in the [[chivalric romance]] ''[[Sir Cleges]]'' as the king to whom Sir Cleges brings the Christmas cherries, obtained by miracle.<ref>Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England''. New York Burt Franklin, 1963. p.79.</ref>\n\n==Modern works==\n[[File:Pelleas and Igraine.jpg|thumb|Uther, on horseback and disguised as Pelleas, watches [[Igraine]] picking flowers in ''Uther and Igraine'' by [[Warwick Deeping]], illustrated by [[Wladyslaw T. Benda]]]]\n\nUther Pendragon remains a widely used character in modern [[List of books about King Arthur|Arthurian literature]] and other fiction. \n\n*In [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Uther the Conqueror is the Norman King of England.\n*[[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]]'s first two books in her Arthurian saga, ''[[The Crystal Cave]]'' and ''[[The Hollow Hills]]'', feature Uther Pendragon as [[Merlin]]'s uncle, Merlin being his brother [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Ambrosius]]' illegitimate son. Uther is depicted as a mostly decent but rather oversexed character, who becomes impotent in later life because of a groin injury, a [[Fisher King]] figure. \n*In [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[The Warlord Chronicles]]'', Uther is the King of [[Dumnonia]] as well as the High King of Britain ruling from [[Dumnonia]]. In these novels, Arthur is his illegitimate son and Morgan is his illegitimate daughter. Cornwell's Uther is highly sceptical of Christianity.\n*In [[Jack Whyte]]'s ''[[The Camulod Chronicles]]'', Uther is King of the Pendragon, the Celtic people of South Cambria, cousin to Caius Merlyn Britannicus and Ambrose Ambrosianus Britannicus. Whyte's novel ''Uther'', written in 2000, revolves around a fictionalised version of Uther's life.\n*In contrast to traditional versions, [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s ''[[Pendragon Cycle]]'' makes Uther's brother [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius]], whose widow ([[Igraine|Ygerna]]) he marries, Arthur's true father.\n*In [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[Mists of Avalon]]'', Uther is the nephew of [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelianus]] instead of his brother; while Aurelianus is the son of a [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]], Uther has no Roman blood. \n*In [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]]'s ''[[The Last Legion]]'', Uther is himself the last Roman Emperor, [[Romulus Augustus]]. While the real Romulus Augustus disappeared from history after being deposed by [[Goths]], in the novel he escapes to Britain, where he adopts the name Pendragon and eventually sires Arthur.\n*In D. J. MacHale's ''Pendragon'' series, the main character, Bobby Pendragon, is the reincarnation of either Uther or his son Arthur.\n*In [[John Boorman]]'s film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'', [[Gabriel Byrne]] plays an ambitious but somewhat obtuse Uther Pendragon, whose uncontrollable lust for Igrayne, while necessary for the birth of Arthur, proves also his own undoing.\n*In the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'', Uther, played by [[Anthony Head]], has banned magic in Camelot and slaughtered any who openly practise the art.

When in proximity to a lye that is dissolving in an open container of water, the use of a vapor-resistant face mask is recommended. Adding lye to water too quickly can cause the solution to boil.\n\n=== Storage ===\nSolid lyes are [[deliquescent]]s and have a strong affinity for air moisture. Solid lyes will deliquesce or dissolve when exposed to open air, absorbing a relatively large amount of water vapour. Accordingly, lyes are stored in air-tight plastic containers. Glass is not a good material to be used for storage as lyes are mildly corrosive to it. Similar to the case of other corrosives, the containers should be labeled to indicate the potential danger of the contents and stored away from children, pets, heat, and moisture.\n\n=== Hazardous reactions ===\nThe majority of safety concerns with lye are also common with most corrosives, such as their potentially destructive effects on [[tissue (biology)|living tissue]]s; examples are the [[skin]], [[flesh]], and the [[cornea]]. Solutions containing lyes can cause [[chemical burn]]s, permanent injuries, scarring and [[blindness]], immediately upon contact. Lyes may be harmful or even fatal if swallowed; ingestion can cause [[esophageal stricture]]. Moreover, the [[solvation]] of dry [[solid]] lyes is highly [[exothermic]]; the resulting [[heat]] may cause additional burns or ignite flammables.\n\nThe reaction between sodium hydroxide and a few metals is also hazardous. [[Aluminium]] reacts with lyes to produce [[hydrogen]] gas. Since hydrogen is [[flammable]], mixing a large quantity of a lye such as sodium hydroxide with aluminum in a closed container is dangerous\u2014especially when the system is at a high temperature, which speeds up the reaction. In addition to aluminum, lyes may also react with [[magnesium]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], [[chromium]], [[brass]] or [[bronze]]\u2014producing hydrogen gas.  Both the potassium and sodium forms are able to dissolve copper.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = McDaniel\n  | first = Robert\n  | title = The Elegant Art of Handmade Soap: Making, Scenting, Coloring, and Shaping\n  | publisher = Krause Publications\n  | location = Iola, WI\n  | year = 1997\n  | isbn = 0-87341-832-8\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/fdcact/fdcact4.htm |title=Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.usp.org/fcc/ |title=Food Chemicals Codex |publisher=United States Pharmacopeia |access-date=2008-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201141105/http://www.usp.org/fcc/ |archive-date=2012-02-01 |url-status=dead }}\n\n[[Category:Bases (chemistry)]]\n[[Category:Hydroxides]]\n[[Category:Household chemicals]]\n[[Category:Deliquescent substances]]\n[[Category:Desiccants]]\n[[Category:Soaps]]\n[[Category:Sodium compounds]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n[[File:Potassium hydroxide.jpg|thumbnail|Pellets of potash lye ([[potassium hydroxide]])]]\n[[File:SodiumHydroxide.jpg|thumbnail|Pellets of soda lye ([[sodium hydroxide]])]]\nA '''lye''' is a [[Alkali metal hydroxide|metal hydroxide]] traditionally obtained by [[leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] ashes, or a strong [[alkali]] which is highly [[water soluble|soluble in water]] producing [[corrosive|caustic]] [[base (chemistry)|basic]] solutions. \"Lye\" refers most commonly refers to [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH), but historically has been used for [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH).\n\nToday, lye is commercially manufactured using a [[Membrane (selective barrier)|membrane cell]] [[chloralkali process]]. It is supplied in various forms such as flakes, pellets, microbeads, coarse powder or a [[solution (chemistry)|solution]]. Lye has traditionally been used as the main ingredient in soap making.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word \"lye\" has cognates in all Germanic languages, and originally designated a bath or hot spring.<ref>Barnhart's Concise Dictionary of Etymology</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== Food ===\nLyes are used to [[Curing (food preservation)|cure]] many types of food, including the traditional Nordic [[lutefisk]], [[olive]]s (making them less bitter), canned [[mandarin orange]]s, [[hominy]], [[lye roll]]s, [[century egg]]s, [[pretzel]]s, [[bagel]]s, and the traditional Turkish pumpkin dessert [[Kabak tatl\u0131s\u0131]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giverecipe.com/pumpkin-dessert-candy-version/|title=Pumpkin Dessert|date=3 February 2011|publisher=}}</ref> (creating a hard crust while the inside remains soft). They are also used as a tenderizer in the crust of baked Cantonese [[Mooncake|moon cakes]], in \"[[zongzi]]\" ([[glutinous rice]] dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves), in chewy southern [[Chinese noodles]] popular in Hong Kong and southern China, and in Japanese [[ramen noodles]]. They are also used in [[kutsinta]], a type of rice cake from the Philippines together with [[pitsi-pits\u00ee]].<ref name=\"philrice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoyrkb.com/ricerecipe/Puto-at-Kutsinta.html|title=Puto|work=Rice Recipes|publisher=Philippine Rice Research Institute|accessdate=15 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125193706/http://www.pinoyrkb.com/ricerecipe/Puto-at-Kutsinta.html|archive-date=25 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Assam, north east India, extensive use is made of a type of lye called khar in Assamese and karwi in Boro which is obtained by filtering the ashes of various banana stems, roots and skin in their cooking and also for curing, as medicine and as a substitute for soap.\n\nIn the [[United States]], food-grade lye must meet the requirements outlined in the [[Food Chemicals Codex]] (FCC),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usp.org/foods/food-ingredient-reference-materials|title=Food Chemicals Codex}}</ref> as prescribed by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref name=FDA>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/lawsenforcedbyfda/federalfooddrugandcosmeticactfdcact/fdcactchapterivfood/default.htm|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|title=FD&C Act Chapter IV: Food|date=2018-11-03}}</ref> Lower grades of lye which are unsuitable for use in food preparation are commonly used as drain de-cloggers and oven cleaners.<ref name=\"FDA\"/>{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Soap ===\nLye in the form of both sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide is used in making [[soap]]. Potassium hydroxide soaps are softer and more easily dissolved in water than sodium hydroxide soaps. Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are not interchangeable in either the proportions required or the properties produced in making soaps.\n\n\"Hot process\" soap making also uses lye as the main ingredient. Lye is added to water, cooled for a few minutes and then added to oils and butters. The mixture is then cooked over a period of time (1\u20132 hours), typically in a [[slow cooker]], and then placed into a mold. This method is much quicker than cold process, as it doesn't take several weeks to complete.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n=== Household ===\n[[File:NaOH - drain-cleaner.jpg|thumbnail|Bottles of [[drain cleaner#Alkaline drain openers|alkaline drain cleaner]]s containing lye]]\nLyes are also valued for their cleaning effects. Sodium hydroxide is commonly the major constituent in commercial and industrial [[cleaning agent|oven cleaner]]s and clogged [[drain opener#Alkaline drain openers|drain opener]]s, due to its [[fat|grease]]-dissolving abilities. Lyes decompose greases via [[ester hydrolysis|alkaline ester hydrolysis]], yielding [[water-soluble]] residues that are easily removed by rinsing.\n\n=== Tissue digestion ===\nSodium or potassium hydroxide can be used to digest tissues of animal carcasses.  Often referred to as [[Alkaline hydrolysis (death custom)|alkaline hydrolysis]], the process involves placing the carcass or body into a sealed chamber, adding a mixture of lye and water and the application of heat to accelerate the process.
