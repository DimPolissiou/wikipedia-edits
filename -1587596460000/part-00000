In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

[[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on family-oriented entertainment.\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation. The service has 50 million subscribers {{as of|2020|04|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{Cite news |last=Spangler |first=Todd |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Daniel |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.

The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on family-oriented entertainment.\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation. The service has 50 million subscribers {{as of|2020|04|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{Cite news |last=Spangler |first=Todd |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Daniel |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.

Along with [[Creative Cloud]] (Adobe's shift to monthly or annual subscription service delivered over the Internet), Illustrator CC was released. The latest version, Illustrator CC 2020, was released on October 24, 2019 and is the 24th generation in the product line. Adobe Illustrator was reviewed as the best vector graphics editing program in 2018 by [[PC Magazine]].\n\n==History==\n===Versions 1\u20131.6 (Illustrator 88)===\nDevelopment of Adobe Illustrator for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Macintosh began in 1985<ref>{{Citation|last=Adobe Creative Cloud|title=The Story Behind Adobe Illustrator (Part 1 of 3) {{!}} Adobe Creative Cloud|date=May 14, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gaCKT_Ncdk|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}</ref> (shipping in January 1987) as a commercialization of Adobe's in-house [[Typeface|font]] development [[software]] and [[PostScript]] file format. Adobe Illustrator is the companion product of [[Adobe Photoshop]]. Photoshop is primarily geared toward [[digital photography|digital photo]] manipulation and [[photorealism|photorealistic]] styles of [[digital illustration|computer illustration]], while Illustrator provides results in the [[typesetting]] and [[logo]] graphic areas of [[graphic design|design]]. Early magazine advertisements (featured in graphic design trade magazines such as ''[[Communication Arts]]'') referred to the product as \"the Adobe Illustrator\".

One window to show the work in progress, the other window to show a preview of the work in progress.\n\n===Versions 2\u20136===\nAlthough during its first decade Adobe developed Illustrator primarily for Macintosh, it sporadically supported other platforms. In the early 1990s, Adobe released versions of Illustrator for [[NeXT]], [[Silicon Graphics]], and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] platforms, but they were discontinued due to poor market acceptance. The first version of Illustrator for Windows, version 2.0, was released in early 1989 and flopped. The next Windows version, version 4.0, was widely criticized as being too similar to Illustrator 1.1 instead of the Macintosh 3.0 version, and certainly not the equal of Windows' most popular illustration package [[CorelDRAW]]. (Note that there were no versions 2.0 or 4.0 for the Macintosh\u2014although, the second release for the Mac was titled Illustrator 88\u2014the year of its release. And there was no version 6 for Windows.) Version 4 was, however, the first version of Illustrator to support editing in preview mode, which did not appear in a Macintosh version until 5.0 in 1993. Version 6 was the last truly Macintosh version of Illustrator. The interface changed radically with the following version to bring consistency between Mac and windows computer platforms. The changes remained until CS6 when some small steps were taken to restore the app to a slightly more Mac-like interface.\n\n== Adobe Media Encoder 14.0 Crack + Torrent (MAC) 2020 Download\n ==\n=== [https://macpcsoft.com/adobe-media-encoder-crack-torrent/ Adobe Media Encoder 14.1.0 Crack + Product Code (Latest Version)]\n ===\nAdobe Media Encoder Crack is a powerful software that is using for video encoding.

It was the last version for the Mac which did not run natively on [[Intel]] processors. Among the new features included in Illustrator CS2 were Live Trace, Live Paint, a control palette and custom workspaces. Live Trace allows for the [[Raster to vector|conversion of bitmap imagery into vector art]] and improved upon the previous tracing abilities. Live Paint allows users more flexibility in applying color to objects, specifically those that overlap. In the same year as the CS2 release, Adobe Systems announced an agreement to acquire Macromedia in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion and it integrated the companies' operations, networks, and customer-care organizations shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"ref19\">{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200512/120505AdobeAcquiresMacromedia.html |title=Adobe Completes Acquisition of Macromedia |publisher=Adobe Systems |date=December 5, 2005 |accessdate=December 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219165519/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200512/120505AdobeAcquiresMacromedia.html |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Adobe now owned FreeHand along with the entire Macromedia product line and in 2007, Adobe announced that it would discontinue development and updates to the FreeHand program.

CS3 was released March 27, 2007.\n\nCS4 was released in October 2008. It features a variety of improvements to old tools along with the introduction of a few brand new tools acquired from FreeHand. The ability to create multiple artboards is one of CS4's main additions from FreeHand. The artboards allow you to create multiple versions of a piece of work within a single document. Other tools include the Blob Brush, which allows multiple overlapping vector brush strokes to easily merge or join, and a revamped gradient tool allowing for more in-depth color manipulation as well as transparency in gradients.\n\nCS5 was released in April 2010. Along with a number of enhancements to existing functionality, Illustrator CS5's new features include a Perspective Grid tool taken from FreeHand, a Bristle Brush (for more natural and painterly looking strokes) and a comprehensive update to strokes, referred to by Adobe as \"Beautiful Strokes\".\n\nVersion CS6 was the sixteenth generation of Adobe Illustrator. Adobe added many more features and several bug fixes such as a new user interface, layer panels, RGB codes, and color ramp to increase performance. CS6 was released on April 23, 2012.\n\n===Version CC===\nAlong with [[Adobe Creative Cloud|Creative Cloud]] (the result of Adobe's shift on its release strategy), Illustrator CC was released. This version (the 17th) was the first to be only sold in a subscription-based service model, in line with the other software in the formerly called [[Creative Suite]]. As part of Creative Cloud, this version brought improvements in that subject such as color, font and program settings syncing, saving documents to the cloud, and integration with [[Behance]] (a creative collaborative network), as well as other features such as a new touch-compatible type tool, images in brushes, CSS extraction, and files packaging.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/hk_en/products/illustrator/versions.html |title=Illustrator CC vs. CS6 versions {{!}} Adobe Illustrator CC history|website=Adobe |access-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Branding==\nStarting with version 1.0, Adobe chose to license an image of [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s \"[[The Birth of Venus]]\" from the [[Bettmann Archive]] and use the portion containing Venus' face as Illustrator's branding image. [[John Warnock]] desired a Renaissance image to evoke his vision of PostScript as a new Renaissance in publishing, and Adobe employee Luanne Seymour Cohen, who was responsible for the early marketing material, found Venus' flowing tresses a perfect vehicle for demonstrating Illustrator's strength in tracing smooth curves over [[bitmap]] source images. Over the years the rendition of this image on Illustrator's splash screen and packaging became more stylized to reflect features added in each version.\n\nThe image of Venus was replaced (albeit still accessible via [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]]) in Illustrator CS (11.0) and CS2 (12.0) by a stylized flower to conform to the Creative Suite's nature imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22837.html?cprose=8-01 |title=Inside CS2: MetaDesign Shares Its Secrets |last=Stone |first=Terri |date=April 27, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103154212/http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22837.html?cprose=8-01 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 3, 2008 |website=CreativePro.com}}</ref> In CS3, Adobe changed the suite branding once again, to simple colored blocks with two-letter abbreviations, resembling a [[periodic table of elements]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://veerle-v2.duoh.com/blog/comments/the_new_adobe_icons_and_branding |title=The new Adobe icons and branding |last=Pieters |first=Veerle |date=December 21, 2006 |website=Veerle's blog |accessdate=December 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207083959/http://veerle-v2.duoh.com/blog/comments/the_new_adobe_icons_and_branding |archive-date=December 7, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Illustrator was represented by the letters '''Ai''' in white against an orange background (oranges and yellows were prominent color schemes in Illustrator branding going back as far as version 4.0). The CS4 icon is almost identical, except for a slight alteration to the font and the color which is dark gray. The CS5 icon is also virtually the same, except that this time the logo is like a box, along with all the other CS5 product logos, with the \"Ai\" bright yellow. CS6 changed it a bit to a brown square with a yellow border and yellow lettering, and in CC 2014 the colors were upgraded to a sharper tone and thinner borders.\n\n==Compatibility==\nCompatibility with [[Inkscape]]:<ref>[http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Inkscape_for_Adobe_Illustrator_users#Formats Inkscape for Adobe Illustrator users], ''Inkscape.org''</ref> Inkscape's native format is [[SVG]] (Scalable Vector Graphics), which is supported by Adobe Illustrator, but the two implementations are not 100% compatible. Inkscape also exports to [[PostScript|PS]], [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] and PDF, formats which Illustrator can recognize.\n\n==Tools==\nA sidebar that appears at the left of the screen with a variety of tools to select, create, and manipulate objects or artworks in Illustrator.

Illustrator''' is a [[vector graphics editor]] developed and marketed by [[Adobe Inc.]] Originally designed for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh]], development of Adobe Illustrator began in 1985. Along with [[Creative Cloud]] (Adobe's shift to monthly or annual subscription service delivered over the Internet), Illustrator CC was released. The latest version, Illustrator CC 2020, was released on October 24, 2019 and is the 24th generation in the product line. Adobe Illustrator was reviewed as the best vector graphics editing program in 2018 by [[PC Magazine]].\n\n==History==\n===Versions 1\u20131.6 (Illustrator 88)===\nDevelopment of Adobe Illustrator for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Macintosh began in 1985<ref>{{Citation|last=Adobe Creative Cloud|title=The Story Behind Adobe Illustrator (Part 1 of 3) {{!}} Adobe Creative Cloud|date=May 14, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gaCKT_Ncdk|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}</ref> (shipping in January 1987) as a commercialization of Adobe's in-house [[Typeface|font]] development [[software]] and [[PostScript]] file format. Adobe Illustrator is the companion product of [[Adobe Photoshop]]. Photoshop is primarily geared toward [[digital photography|digital photo]] manipulation and [[photorealism|photorealistic]] styles of [[digital illustration|computer illustration]], while Illustrator provides results in the [[typesetting]] and [[logo]] graphic areas of [[graphic design|design]]. Early magazine advertisements (featured in graphic design trade magazines such as ''[[Communication Arts]]'') referred to the product as \"the Adobe Illustrator\". Illustrator 88, the product name for version 1.7,<ref>{{cite web|first=Marcin|last=Wichary |url=http://www.guidebookgallery.org/splashes/illustrator |title=Illustrator splash screens |publisher=Guidebookgallery.org |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2010}}</ref> was released in 1988 and introduced many new tools and features.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNLFXKyCy0A |title=Illustrator 88 demonstration video |publisher=Youtube.com |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=December 4, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101020171920/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNLFXKyCy0A| archivedate= October 20, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' in 1989 listed Illustrator 88 as among the \"Distinction\" winners of the Byte Awards, stating that with it Adobe had \"pulled ahead\" of previously industry-dominant competitor [[Aldus FreeHand]].<ref name=\"byte198901\">{{cite magazine |date=January 1989 |title=The Byte Awards |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1989-01/1989_01_BYTE_14-01_PC_Communications_and_Annual_Awards_and_Digitizing_Tablets#page/n371/mode/2up |magazine=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]] |page=327}}</ref>\n\nEarly versions of the software did not support working in preview mode and users needed to have two windows open on their desktop in order to have a live preview of their work. One window to show the work in progress, the other window to show a preview of the work in progress.\n\n===Versions 2\u20136===\nAlthough during its first decade Adobe developed Illustrator primarily for Macintosh, it sporadically supported other platforms. In the early 1990s, Adobe released versions of Illustrator for [[NeXT]], [[Silicon Graphics]], and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] platforms, but they were discontinued due to poor market acceptance. The first version of Illustrator for Windows, version 2.0, was released in early 1989 and flopped. The next Windows version, version 4.0, was widely criticized as being too similar to Illustrator 1.1 instead of the Macintosh 3.0 version, and certainly not the equal of Windows' most popular illustration package [[CorelDRAW]]. (Note that there were no versions 2.0 or 4.0 for the Macintosh\u2014although, the second release for the Mac was titled Illustrator 88\u2014the year of its release. And there was no version 6 for Windows.) Version 4 was, however, the first version of Illustrator to support editing in preview mode, which did not appear in a Macintosh version until 5.0 in 1993. Version 6 was the last truly Macintosh version of Illustrator. The interface changed radically with the following version to bring consistency between Mac and windows computer platforms. The changes remained until CS6 when some small steps were taken to restore the app to a slightly more Mac-like interface.\n\n===Versions 7\u201310===\n[[File:Illustrator 10.png|thumb|Adobe Illustrator 10, the last version before the Creative Suite rebrand]]\nWith the introduction of Illustrator 7 in 1997, Adobe made critical changes in the user interface with regard to path editing (and also to converge on the same [[user interface]] as [[Adobe Photoshop]]), and many users opted not to upgrade. Illustrator also began to support [[TrueType]], effectively ending the \"font wars\" between PostScript [[Type 1 font|Type 1]] and TrueType. Like Photoshop, Illustrator also began supporting plug-ins, greatly and quickly extending its abilities.\n\nWith true user interface parity between Macintosh and Windows versions starting with 7.0, designers could finally standardize on Illustrator. [[Corel]] did port [[CorelDRAW]] 6.0 to the Macintosh in late 1996, but it was received as too little, too late. Designers tended to prefer Illustrator, Drawcord, or FreeHand, based on which software they learned first. As an example, there are capabilities in [[Adobe FreeHand|FreeHand]] still not available in Illustrator (higher scaling percentages, advanced find-and-replace feature, selective round-corner editing, export/print selected objects only, etc.).<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.design-tools.com/freehand/ |title=FreeHand Firsts |website=The Nelson Group, Inc.}}</ref> Famously, [[Aldus]] did a comparison matrix between its own FreeHand, Illustrator and Draw, and Draw's one \"win\" was that it came with three different clip art views of the human pancreas.\n\nAdobe bought Aldus in 1994 for PageMaker.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3065/is_n7_v23/ai_15379575/ |title=Merger creates stronger DTP competition |publisher=Folio |date=April 15, 1994 |accessdate=February 11, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> As part of the transaction, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] issued a complaint of [[Adobe Systems]] on October 18, 1994, ordering a divestiture of FreeHand to \"remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the acquisition\"<ref name=\"ref3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.freefreehand.org/images/FTC.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524203011/http://www.freefreehand.org/images/FTC.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 24, 2010 |title=Federal Trade Commission Decisions, Complaint 118 F., |work=In the matter of Adobe Systems Incorporated, Et Al. |date=October 18, 1994 |accessdate=February 8, 2010 }}</ref> because of Adobe's Illustrator software.

Adobe was an early developer of SVG for the web and Illustrator exported SVG files via the SVG File Format plugin.<ref name=\"ref5\">{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/svg/|title=Scalable Vector Graphics|publisher=Adobe}}</ref> Using the Adobe SVG Viewer (ASV), introduced in 2000, allowed users to view SVG images in most major browsers until it was discontinued in 2009.<ref name=\"ref6\">{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/svg/eol.html|title=Adobe to Discontinue Adobe SVG Viewer|publisher=Adobe}}</ref>  Native support for SVG was not complete in all major browsers until Internet Explorer 9 in 2011.<ref name=\"ref7\">[[Scalable Vector Graphics#Compatibility]]</ref>\n\nIllustrator Version 9 included a tracing feature, similar to that within Adobe's discontinued product [[Adobe Streamline|Streamline]].\n\nIllustrator version 10 was released by Adobe in November 2001.\n\n===Versions CS\u2013CS6===\nIllustrator CS (aka version 11), released by Adobe for Mac and Windows in October 2003, was the first version to include 3-dimensional capabilities allowing users to extrude or revolve shapes to create simple [[3D computer graphics|3D]] objects.\n\nIllustrator CS2 (version 12), released by Adobe in April 2005, was available for both the [[macOS|Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems. It was the last version for the Mac which did not run natively on [[Intel]] processors. Among the new features included in Illustrator CS2 were Live Trace, Live Paint, a control palette and custom workspaces. Live Trace allows for the [[Raster to vector|conversion of bitmap imagery into vector art]] and improved upon the previous tracing abilities. Live Paint allows users more flexibility in applying color to objects, specifically those that overlap. In the same year as the CS2 release, Adobe Systems announced an agreement to acquire Macromedia in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion and it integrated the companies' operations, networks, and customer-care organizations shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"ref19\">{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200512/120505AdobeAcquiresMacromedia.html |title=Adobe Completes Acquisition of Macromedia |publisher=Adobe Systems |date=December 5, 2005 |accessdate=December 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219165519/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200512/120505AdobeAcquiresMacromedia.html |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Adobe now owned FreeHand along with the entire Macromedia product line and in 2007, Adobe announced that it would discontinue development and updates to the FreeHand program.

CS3 was released March 27, 2007.\n\nCS4 was released in October 2008. It features a variety of improvements to old tools along with the introduction of a few brand new tools acquired from FreeHand. The ability to create multiple artboards is one of CS4's main additions from FreeHand. The artboards allow you to create multiple versions of a piece of work within a single document. Other tools include the Blob Brush, which allows multiple overlapping vector brush strokes to easily merge or join, and a revamped gradient tool allowing for more in-depth color manipulation as well as transparency in gradients.\n\nCS5 was released in April 2010. Along with a number of enhancements to existing functionality, Illustrator CS5's new features include a Perspective Grid tool taken from FreeHand, a Bristle Brush (for more natural and painterly looking strokes) and a comprehensive update to strokes, referred to by Adobe as \"Beautiful Strokes\".\n\nVersion CS6 was the sixteenth generation of Adobe Illustrator. Adobe added many more features and several bug fixes such as a new user interface, layer panels, RGB codes, and color ramp to increase performance. CS6 was released on April 23, 2012.\n\n===Version CC===\nAlong with [[Adobe Creative Cloud|Creative Cloud]] (the result of Adobe's shift on its release strategy), Illustrator CC was released. This version (the 17th) was the first to be only sold in a subscription-based service model, in line with the other software in the formerly called [[Creative Suite]]. As part of Creative Cloud, this version brought improvements in that subject such as color, font and program settings syncing, saving documents to the cloud, and integration with [[Behance]] (a creative collaborative network), as well as other features such as a new touch-compatible type tool, images in brushes, CSS extraction, and files packaging.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/hk_en/products/illustrator/versions.html |title=Illustrator CC vs. CS6 versions {{!}} Adobe Illustrator CC history|website=Adobe |access-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Branding==\nStarting with version 1.0, Adobe chose to license an image of [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s \"[[The Birth of Venus]]\" from the [[Bettmann Archive]] and use the portion containing Venus' face as Illustrator's branding image. [[John Warnock]] desired a Renaissance image to evoke his vision of PostScript as a new Renaissance in publishing, and Adobe employee Luanne Seymour Cohen, who was responsible for the early marketing material, found Venus' flowing tresses a perfect vehicle for demonstrating Illustrator's strength in tracing smooth curves over [[bitmap]] source images. Over the years the rendition of this image on Illustrator's splash screen and packaging became more stylized to reflect features added in each version.\n\nThe image of Venus was replaced (albeit still accessible via [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]]) in Illustrator CS (11.0) and CS2 (12.0) by a stylized flower to conform to the Creative Suite's nature imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22837.html?cprose=8-01 |title=Inside CS2: MetaDesign Shares Its Secrets |last=Stone |first=Terri |date=April 27, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103154212/http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22837.html?cprose=8-01 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 3, 2008 |website=CreativePro.com}}</ref> In CS3, Adobe changed the suite branding once again, to simple colored blocks with two-letter abbreviations, resembling a [[periodic table of elements]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://veerle-v2.duoh.com/blog/comments/the_new_adobe_icons_and_branding |title=The new Adobe icons and branding |last=Pieters |first=Veerle |date=December 21, 2006 |website=Veerle's blog |accessdate=December 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207083959/http://veerle-v2.duoh.com/blog/comments/the_new_adobe_icons_and_branding |archive-date=December 7, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Illustrator was represented by the letters '''Ai''' in white against an orange background (oranges and yellows were prominent color schemes in Illustrator branding going back as far as version 4.0). The CS4 icon is almost identical, except for a slight alteration to the font and the color which is dark gray. The CS5 icon is also virtually the same, except that this time the logo is like a box, along with all the other CS5 product logos, with the \"Ai\" bright yellow. CS6 changed it a bit to a brown square with a yellow border and yellow lettering, and in CC 2014 the colors were upgraded to a sharper tone and thinner borders.\n\n==Compatibility==\nCompatibility with [[Inkscape]]:<ref>[http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Inkscape_for_Adobe_Illustrator_users#Formats Inkscape for Adobe Illustrator users], ''Inkscape.org''</ref> Inkscape's native format is [[SVG]] (Scalable Vector Graphics), which is supported by Adobe Illustrator, but the two implementations are not 100% compatible. Inkscape also exports to [[PostScript|PS]], [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] and PDF, formats which Illustrator can recognize.\n\n==Tools==\nA sidebar that appears at the left of the screen with a variety of tools to select, create, and manipulate objects or artworks in Illustrator. These tools can be selected as following: drawing, typing, painting, reshaping, slicing and cutting, symbolism, moving and zooming, and graph.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/tool-galleries.html |title=Tool Galleries |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref> Some tools have a small triangle at the bottom right of the toolbox icon. A small triangle has the option to view or expand some hidden tools by hold down the mouse button on the triangle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/tools.html |title=Tools |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome examples of basic tools in illustrator are selection tools, paintbrush tools, pen tools, pencil tools e.g. '''Selection tools''' are used to the layout, adjust, and organize the artwork by selecting, positioning, and stacking object accurately. Moreover, selection tools can group, lock or hide, and measure objects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/selecting-objects.html#select_objects_with_the_selection_tool |title=Selection Tool Galleries |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref> '''Paintbrush tools''' can be used to modify the appearance of the artwork. There are different types of brushes: calligraphic, scatter, art, pattern, and bristle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/brushes.html#draw_paths_and_apply_brush_strokes_simultaneously |title=Brushes Tools |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref> '''Pen tools''' create straight and curved lines for the artwork and they can add anchor points to paths and delete from paths. '''Pencil tools''' allow the user to draw and edit freehand lines.\n\n==Release history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Release history of Adobe Illustrator, sorted by version number<ref>{{cite web |url=https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/illustrator-releasenotes.html |title=Illustrator release notes |date=October 13, 2017 |website=Adobe |access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The report detailed that two months into the 2017 season, [[Alex Cora]], Carlos Beltr\u00e1n, and a group of unnamed players worked to create a system to steal signs. One or more players would watch the live feed on a monitor behind the dugout, and decode the signs. The players initially experimented with clapping, whistling, and yelling, but determined banging a trash can with a bat was most effective. One or two bangs corresponded to a [[breaking ball]], and no banging indicated a [[fastball]]. In addition to the banging method, Astros employees in the video room would also decode signs and send information to the dugout to be relayed to runners on second base who would relay signs to the batter. Players were concerned about their method being discovered by other teams, and several players said there was a sense of \"panic\" in the dugout after White Sox pitcher Danny Farquhar appeared to notice the banging in a September 2017 game. After the Farquhar incident, the Astros replaced the wall-mounted monitor and used a portable monitor in the postseason.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/01/14/the-panic-moment-astros-cheating-players-thought-they-were-busted/|title= The 'panic' moment Astros' cheating players thought they were busted|website=[[New York Post]]|first=Justin|last=Tasch|date=January 14, 2020|accessdate=January 19, 2020}}</ref> The team continued using illicit methods to steal signs in the 2017 postseason (though Manfred later said there was \"conflicting evidence\" about whether it continued into the postseason or not).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2020/02/19/rob-manfred-astros-2017-trash-can-incident|title=Rob Manfred Says Astros' Trash Can Banging Occurred During 2017 Postseason|date=February 18, 2020|website=[[Sports Illustrated]]|last=Pickman|first=Ben|accessdate=February 19, 2020}}</ref> The Astros did not use the banging method in 2018, but continued to use other methods until players decided it was no longer effective and stopped at some point in the 2018 season.

Manfred found that while Luhnow didn't know about the players' role in the scheme, he should have made it his business to know about the players' activities, especially in light of earlier sign-stealing scandals. According to Manfred, had Luhnow taken \"adequate steps\" to ensure the Astros followed the rules, the sign stealing operation could have been shut down as early as Manfred's September 2017 memo, and certainly by March 2018, when MLB disciplinarian [[Joe Torre]] issued a memo which clarified the ban on using technology to steal signs. Manfred wrote that since the general manager was responsible for ensuring compliance with \"both standards of conduct set by Club ownership and MLB Rules,\" he was holding Luhnow \"personally accountable for the conduct of his Club.\"<ref name=report/>\n\nThe investigation found that Hinch did not approve of the use of the replay monitor in this manner, and even destroyed it on two occasions. However, he did allow it to continue through the team's run to the 2017 World Series. Manfred harshly criticized him for this, saying that since the manager is responsible for directly supervising the players and coaches, there was \"no justification for Hinch's failure to act\". Although Hinch regretted his failure to act, Manfred said that he had to hold him responsible for it.<ref name=report/>\n\nNo players were punished because they had been given [[Witness immunity|immunity]] by MLB in exchange for their cooperation.<ref name=\"wsj12220\"/> MLB reportedly made the immunity deal with players because it believed it would not win [[Grievance (labour)|grievances]] from the [[MLB Players Association|players union]] if it attempted to discipline players.<ref name=\"wsj12220\"/> In his report Manfred said it was \"difficult and impractical\" to determine degrees of culpability by players due to the sheer number of players involved.  He placed primary responsibility on Luhnow and Hinch, saying that the general manager and field manager are responsible for \"ensuring that the players both understand the rules and adhere to them\". If Luhnow and Hinch were to commit further \"material violations\" of baseball rules, they will be [[List of people banned from Major League Baseball|permanently banned from baseball]]. Additionally, Luhnow will be required to undergo \"management/leadership training\" while he is suspended.<ref name=report/>\n\nHinch's year-long suspension was the second-most severe punishment in baseball history meted out to a manager for in-game misconduct. The only longer suspension was for [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]] manager [[Jack O'Connor (catcher)|Jack O'Connor]], who was banned for life for trying to throw the 1910 American League batting title to [[Nap Lajoie]] by bribing the official scorer to change an [[error (baseball)|error]] to a hit in the final game of the season.\n\n==Firings==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer    = Three MLB managers lost their jobs as a result of their involvement in the scandal while with the Astros (from top to bottom): {{nowrap|[[A.

The report detailed that two months into the 2017 season, [[Alex Cora]], Carlos Beltr\u00e1n, and a group of unnamed players worked to create a system to steal signs. One or more players would watch the live feed on a monitor behind the dugout, and decode the signs. The players initially experimented with clapping, whistling, and yelling, but determined banging a trash can with a bat was most effective. One or two bangs corresponded to a [[breaking ball]], and no banging indicated a [[fastball]]. In addition to the banging method, Astros employees in the video room would also decode signs and send information to the dugout to be relayed to runners on second base who would relay signs to the batter. Players were concerned about their method being discovered by other teams, and several players said there was a sense of \"panic\" in the dugout after White Sox pitcher Danny Farquhar appeared to notice the banging in a September 2017 game. After the Farquhar incident, the Astros replaced the wall-mounted monitor and used a portable monitor in the postseason.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/01/14/the-panic-moment-astros-cheating-players-thought-they-were-busted/|title= The 'panic' moment Astros' cheating players thought they were busted|website=[[New York Post]]|first=Justin|last=Tasch|date=January 14, 2020|accessdate=January 19, 2020}}</ref> The team continued using illicit methods to steal signs in the 2017 postseason (though Manfred later said there was \"conflicting evidence\" about whether it continued into the postseason or not).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2020/02/19/rob-manfred-astros-2017-trash-can-incident|title=Rob Manfred Says Astros' Trash Can Banging Occurred During 2017 Postseason|date=February 18, 2020|website=[[Sports Illustrated]]|last=Pickman|first=Ben|accessdate=February 19, 2020}}</ref> The Astros did not use the banging method in 2018, but continued to use other methods until players decided it was no longer effective and stopped at some point in the 2018 season.

Manfred found that while Luhnow didn't know about the players' role in the scheme, he should have made it his business to know about the players' activities, especially in light of earlier sign-stealing scandals. According to Manfred, had Luhnow taken \"adequate steps\" to ensure the Astros followed the rules, the sign stealing operation could have been shut down as early as Manfred's September 2017 memo, and certainly by March 2018, when MLB disciplinarian [[Joe Torre]] issued a memo which clarified the ban on using technology to steal signs. Manfred wrote that since the general manager was responsible for ensuring compliance with \"both standards of conduct set by Club ownership and MLB Rules,\" he was holding Luhnow \"personally accountable for the conduct of his Club.\"<ref name=report/>\n\nThe investigation found that Hinch did not approve of the use of the replay monitor in this manner, and even destroyed it on two occasions.

The prologue culminates when Nidaros, his companion, Sarabos, and their followers are trapped by the enemy inside a cave. The Picts seem to fear the place, understandably, since it shows signs of having once been a site sacred to Set, the serpent god of Stygia. Oddly, the Aquilonians also discover a great stone statue in the image of the former king Conan the First (or Conan the Great, as he is also remembered). Should they doubt it, they need only look at Sarabos; it's an open secret that he is a bastard son of the first Conan, and hence a half-brother of Conn.\n\nThe tale then shifts to events many years earlier in the life of Conan the First, well before he became ruler of Aquilonia, in the wake of \"[[Queen of the Black Coast]]\". Following the death of his lover, the pirate queen Belit, Conan ventures inland into the jungles of Kush. He encounters and joins forces with a band of Bamula tribesmen. Aiding the Bamulas in their conflict with an enemy tribe, he rises to a position of precarious authority among them.\n\nSuddenly, creatures alien to the Bamulas begin invading their territory, including a dragon and a polar bear. They turn out to have been transported through a magical portal. Entering the portal with his warriors in an attempt to end the threat, Conan finds himself teleported to the far-distant Pictish Wilderness. The portal, known as the '''Demon's Gate''', turns out to be the creation of an exiled wizard. He intends on sacrificing both Conan and the Bamulas, so he can animate the statue of an ancient warrior for his own evil purposes.\n\nPlot complications present themselves in the form of the wizard's beautiful daughter and the native Picts, who are violently hostile towards all strangers. All of Conan's prowess and craft are needed to deal with the impossible situation as one threat follows another in rapid succession.\n\nMuch of the concluding portion of this story is narrated to Nidaros and Sarabos by their comrade in arms, Vasilios, a half-Pictish Aquilonian warrior who had heard it in turn from his Pictish mother. The tale gradually unfolds of how Conan eventually defeated his enemies, before transporting himself and the Bamulas safely back to their country\u2014and how the statue took on his aspect.\n\nAn epilogue returns the scene to Nidaros, Sarabos, and their companions listening to the end of Vasilios's tale. The company is rescued from the besieging Picts by a relief force who had been informed of their plight by a mysterious messenger the very evening they were trapped in the cave. According to Vasilios, it's said that the statue will aid the blood-kin of the warrior it is fashioned after at need, and the three speculate that the messenger was a magical sending from the statue, prompted by Sarabos's presence. They decide to keep silent about it.\n\n==Reception==\nCritic [[Don D'Ammassa]] wrote \"The two halves of the novel feel very different \u2013 an African survival story followed by the familiar battle with sorcery.

Remote groups of the species are remnant to former distribution ranges, to different climates, and these may be isolated by hundreds of kilometres. The species is one of those in the region to include \"wet outliers\", small populations outside of the usual low rainfall habitat.<ref>{{cite book | first =George|last=Seddon| authorlink = George Seddon (academic)|title= Sense of Place |location=Perth |publisher = University of Western Australia Press | year=1972|pages = 108, 116 | isbn=1-84091-158-1}}</ref>\n\nOccurrence of the plant is also recorded in [[South Australia]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[New South Wales]], and Queensland.<ref name=EJ8/> It is widespread in western New South Wales, eastwards to Dubbo and Culcairn.<ref name=\"floransw\">{{NSW Flora Online|genus=Santalum |species=acuminatum |author=B.

Hosts can be other trees, or grasses, usually several plants are used. The taxa recorded in this relationship are species of genera; ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Maireana]]'', ''[[Atriplex]]'', and many others, including hemiparasites such as ''[[Exocarpos sparteus]]''. This mechanism allows the plant to acquire 70% of its nitrogen, and some of its water requirements from the roots of other trees and shrubs.<ref name=\"Ann.Bot Vol.80\">{{cite journal |first=K.

It is tolerant of drought, salt, and high temperatures, and need not have a nutrient-rich environment. The seedling can become established in the shade of its host, reaching for full sun once developed, so the plant is usually intermingled with host and other species.\n\nThe environs of the distribution range are subject to frequent [[bushfire]]s, this requires the plant to regenerate from its roots, so the species is rarely found as an advanced tree. Those specimens exposed to bushfire and soil disturbance occur as sprawling multistemmed shrubs. The plant's regrowth from the root system gives this species a lead over shrubs that recur from seed. Trees with a single main stem are in locations remote from these factors. The habit of older trees may overwhelm the adjacent plants by monopolising the sunlight and parasitising roots of plants beyond its own canopy.\n\nThe foliage, being much paler than other trees and shrubs, makes the plant conspicuous in bushland and scrub. An occurrence of an unmolested specimen is recorded at [[Woodman Point]] in Western Australia, an area remote from the high-intensity fires of altered regimens.\n\n[[Emu]]s eat the fruit, and it forms an important part of their diet; the nut remains undigested in their droppings. This is the usual method of ''S. acuminatum'' seed dispersal, when it is within the emu's range.\n\nA number of species interact with this plant, in a number of complex relationships, a noted example being ''[[Paraepermenia santaliella]]'', the quandong moth of the family [[Epermeniidae]]. Other creatures, such as larvae of [[Sap beetle|nitidulid]] beetles and the [[Delias aganippe|wood white butterfly]], also feed on ''S. acuminatum''.\n<!-- Pollination? -->\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:QuongdongNut 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|A desert quandong nut on a piece of [[paperbark]]]]\nThe fruit and nut were important foods to the peoples of arid and semiarid central Australia, especially for its high [[vitamin C]] content.<ref name=\"Nikulinsky\"/> It is commercially grown and marketed as a [[bush food]] and is sometimes made into a [[jam]], an enterprise begun in the 1970s. It is well known as an exotic food.\n\n===Propagation and pests===\nInadequate knowledge of the plant's ecology led to many early failures in the cultivation of this species. Commercial trials and propagation by enthusiasts have attempted to reproduce the circumstances of its native habitat; well-drained soil, germination techniques, and selection of appropriate hosts have been more successful. Germinating the seed has been more successful, up to 35% when it laid aside for 12 \u2013 18&nbsp;months. Growers laying seeds into mulch, obtained from host plants, report a high rate of success.<ref name=\"ABC\">{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/gardening/stories/s2176270.htm | title = Fact Sheet: Quandong Garden | accessdate = | author = Josh Byrne | date = 1 March 2008 | work = Gardening Australia | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> Cultivation of this plant has faced other obstacles; for example, the species is susceptible to a number of pests and fungal diseases.<ref name=\"DPI\"/>\n\nThe research and development of domestication of the species was first undertaken by Brian Powell, at a property in [[Quorn, South Australia]].

The study of ''[[Melia azedarach]]'' (white cedar) as a host to this species revealed that ''S. acuminatum'' acquired insecticidal compounds that increased its resistance to the quandong moth. Researchers then determined that [[neurotoxins]] found in the host plant, and other substances harmful to mammals, can pass into the harvested fruit.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file_id=EC107p34.pdf|title=Hosting the quandong|author=Steve Davidson|publisher= [[CSIRO]] |quote= citing: Transfer of photosynthate and naturally occurring insecticidal compounds from host plants to the root hemiparasite'' Santalum acuminatum'' (Santalaceae).

The fruit is frequently mentioned in natural histories and botanical works, such as ''Flowers and plants of Western Australia'',<ref name=\"Erickson 1973\"/> and traded as a commodity, however, the kernel of the seed has, historically, been the most extensively used.\n\nColonial ethnic groups did not attempt to domesticate indigenous plants in Australia, despite being known and occasionally used, but the great demand from export markets to Singapore, Britain, and elsewhere led to financial backing of growers and enthusiasts. The backyard of Dudley and Lyla Frahn in [[Paringa, South Australia]], contained an orchard of quandongs. The couple recorded yield and qualities of the fruit, one of which became the source for the variety registered and marketed as 'Frahn's Paringa Gold'.<ref name=\"The Age\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.quandongs.com/ Quorn Quandongs]\n* [http://www.sardi.sa.gov.au/pdfserve/ento/hort_pests/quandong.pdf Quandong moth and other pests]\n* [http://sres.anu.edu.au/associated/fpt/nwfp/quandong/Quandong.html The Desert Quandong]\n* [http://www.users.centralonline.com.au/aqia/ Australian Quandong Industry Association]\n* [http://www.nullarbornet.com.au/themes/quandongs.html The Quandong Story]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2702923}}\n\n[[Category:Bushfood]]\n[[Category:Trees of Australia]]\n[[Category:Drought-tolerant trees]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mediterranean climate]]\n[[Category:Eudicots of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Flora of South Australia]]\n[[Category:Desert fruits]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from Australia]]\n[[Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Flora of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Australian Aboriginal bushcraft]]\n[[Category:Santalum|acuminatum]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1810]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Species of plant}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=August 2011}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| image = Santalum acuminatum fruit1.JPG\n| image2 = Santalum acuminatum - Flickr - Kevin Thiele.jpg\n| genus = Santalum\n| species = acuminatum\n| authority = [[Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle|A.DC.]]\n}}\n\n'''''Santalum acuminatum''''', the '''Desert Quandong''', is a [[hemiparasitic]] plant in the [[sandalwood]] family, [[Santalaceae]], (Native to Australia) which is widely dispersed throughout the central deserts and southern areas of [[Australia]].\nThe species, especially its [[Eating|Edible]] fruit, is also commonly referred to as '''Quandong''' or '''Native Peach'''.

It is tolerant of drought, salt, and high temperatures, and need not have a nutrient-rich environment. The seedling can become established in the shade of its host, reaching for full sun once developed, so the plant is usually intermingled with host and other species.\n\nThe environs of the distribution range are subject to frequent [[bushfire]]s, this requires the plant to regenerate from its roots, so the species is rarely found as an advanced tree. Those specimens exposed to bushfire and soil disturbance occur as sprawling multistemmed shrubs. The plant's regrowth from the root system gives this species a lead over shrubs that recur from seed. Trees with a single main stem are in locations remote from these factors. The habit of older trees may overwhelm the adjacent plants by monopolising the sunlight and parasitising roots of plants beyond its own canopy.\n\nThe foliage, being much paler than other trees and shrubs, makes the plant conspicuous in bushland and scrub. An occurrence of an unmolested specimen is recorded at [[Woodman Point]] in Western Australia, an area remote from the high-intensity fires of altered regimens.\n\n[[Emu]]s eat the fruit, it forming an important part of their diet; the nut remains undigested in their droppings. This is the usual method of ''S. acuminatum'' seed dispersal, when it is within the emu's range.\n\nA number of species interact with this plant, in a number of complex relationships, a noted example being ''[[Paraepermenia santaliella]]'', the quandong moth of the family [[Epermeniidae]]. Other creatures, such as larvae of [[Sap beetle|nitidulid]] beetles and the [[Delias aganippe|wood white butterfly]], also feed on ''S. acuminatum''.\n<!-- Pollination? -->\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:QuongdongNut 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|A desert quandong nut on a piece of [[paperbark]]]]\nThe fruit and nut were important foods to the peoples of arid and semiarid central Australia, especially for its high [[vitamin C]] content.<ref name=\"Nikulinsky\"/> It is commercially grown and marketed as a [[bush food]] and is sometimes made into a [[jam]], an enterprise begun in the 1970s.

A known application of the extract was to heal ailments of the skin.<ref name=\"DPI\"/> The commercial production of cogenor ''S. spicatum'' is more advanced than this species, although research is being undertaken into the marketing of these medicinal substances.<ref name=\"DPI\"/>\n\n===Fuel===\nThe seed is very high in flammable oils, like a [[candlenut]], so it is able to be burnt as an illuminant. The wood is also oily, useful for starting a fire as a [[Fire making|friction stick]].\n\n===Timber===\nThe hard, oily, timber is used for furniture and [[cabinet making]] by regional craftsmen, but it is not used extensively. It is a durable material, but lacks the aromatic qualities of other sandalwoods. The hard and wrinkled nuts have been used ornamentally, for necklaces and shirt buttons, and were used as marbles on [[chinese checkers]]' boards.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anbg.gov.au/aborig.s.e.aust/phragmites-australis.html | title = 4 Common Reed ''Phragmites australis'' | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | author = Nash, Daphne| work = Aboriginal Plant Use in South-Eastern Australia | publisher = Australian National Botanic Gardens \u2013 Education Service}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe oil of sandalwoods, primarily ''[[Santalum album]]'', was described and investigated by [[pharmacologist]]s. The more widely known Australian sandalwood, ''S. spicatum'', was extensively harvested and exported, leaving ''S. acuminatum'' as the more common ''Santalum'' in many regions.\n\nThe established use of the fruit, by Aboriginal peoples, was acknowledged by the early settlers of the colonies; this product was made into jam and chutney. The fruit is frequently mentioned in natural histories and botanical works, such as ''Flowers and plants of Western Australia'',<ref name=\"Erickson 1973\"/> and traded as a commodity, however, the kernel of the seed has, historically, been the most extensively used.\n\nColonial ethnic groups did not attempt to domesticate indigenous plants in Australia, despite being known and occasionally used, but the great demand from export markets to Singapore, Britain, and elsewhere led to financial backing of growers and enthusiasts. The backyard of Dudley and Lyla Frahn in [[Paringa, South Australia]], contained an orchard of quandongs. The couple recorded yield and qualities of the fruit, one of which became the source for the variety registered and marketed as 'Frahn's Paringa Gold'.<ref name=\"The Age\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.quandongs.com/ Quorn Quandongs]\n* [http://www.sardi.sa.gov.au/pdfserve/ento/hort_pests/quandong.pdf Quandong moth and other pests]\n* [http://sres.anu.edu.au/associated/fpt/nwfp/quandong/Quandong.html The Desert Quandong]\n* [http://www.users.centralonline.com.au/aqia/ Australian Quandong Industry Association]\n* [http://www.nullarbornet.com.au/themes/quandongs.html The Quandong Story]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2702923}}\n\n[[Category:Bushfood]]\n[[Category:Trees of Australia]]\n[[Category:Drought-tolerant trees]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mediterranean climate]]\n[[Category:Eudicots of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Flora of South Australia]]\n[[Category:Desert fruits]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from Australia]]\n[[Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Flora of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Australian Aboriginal bushcraft]]\n[[Category:Santalum|acuminatum]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1810]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "copy edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santalum_acuminatum"}
