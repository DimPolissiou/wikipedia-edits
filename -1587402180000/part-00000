Heavy gradients in the [[Western Ghats]] necessitated the introduction of electric traction on the GIPR to [[Igatpuri]] on the North East line and [[Pune]] on the South East line. On 5 January 1928 1500 V DC traction was introduced on the suburban section of the [[Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway]] between [[Colaba]] and [[Borivili]], and between [[Madras]] Beach and [[Tambaram]] of the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway]] on 11 May 1931, to meet growing traffic needs.<ref name=\"ELECT\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.core.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,302,532 |title=Brief on Railway Electrification |access-date=1 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926072829/http://www.core.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,302,532 |archive-date=26 September 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The 3000 V DC electrification of the [[Howrah]]-[[Burdwan]] section of the [[Eastern Railway Zone (India)|Eastern Railway]] was completed in 1958.

Indian Railways decided in 1957 to adopt 25 kV AC as its standard, with SNCF their consultant in the early stages. The first 25 kV AC section was Raj Kharswan\u2013Dongoaposi on the [[South Eastern Railway Zone, India|South Eastern Railway]] in 1960. The first 25 kV AC [[electric multiple unit|EMUs]], for [[Kolkata]] suburban service, began service in September 1962. For continuity, the Howrah\u2013Burdwan section of the Eastern Railway and the Madras Beach\u2013Tambaram section of the Southern Railway were converted to 25 kV AC by 1968. Because of limitations in the DC traction system, a decision was made to convert the electric traction system of the Mumbai suburban rail network of WR and CR from 1.5kV DC to 25 kV AC in 1996\u201397. The conversion from DC to AC traction was completed in 2012 by Western Railway, and in 2016 by Central Railway. Since then, the entire electrified mainline rail network in India uses 25 kV AC, and DC traction is used only for metros and trams.<ref name=\"ELECT\"/>\n\n[[File:Railway Electrification Rate for Leading & Laggard State\u2019s of India 2018.png|thumb|left|Railway electrification rate for leading and laggard states of India]]\n[[File:Railway-Electrification-Trend-&-Roadmap-for-India-till-FY-2022.png|thumb|right|Railway electrification trend and road map for India until FY 2022]]\n\nIndian Railways announced on 31 March 2017 that the country's entire rail network would be electrified by 2022.<ref name=\"indianexpress.com\"/><ref name=\"enincon1\">{{cite web|url=https://enincon.com/report/railway-electrification-market-opportunities-in-india-2018/|title=Railway Electrification Market in India 2018|date=20 February 2018|publisher=Enincon|access-date=20 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230336/https://enincon.com/report/railway-electrification-market-opportunities-in-india-2018/|archive-date=20 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThough not a nascent concept, the electrification in India now has been committed with a fresh investment of {{INRConvert|35000|c}} to electrify the entire network and eliminate the cost of fuel under transportation which will amount to a massive savings of {{INRConvert|10500|c}} overall.

As Torres is comatose, NCIS and a vengeful Bishop must navigate a political minefield involving Xavier Zolotov, the spoiled son of an influential Russian family. During the course of the investigation, the team finds Zolotov murdered (presumably by his girlfriend, who was a material suspect in Torres's previous undercover assignment years earlier). A strand of blonde hair is found at the crime scene; the girlfriend is blonde, leading the team to suspect her, though McGee is uneasy that Bishop may have followed through with her intention to kill Zolotov. However, after she confirms she did not do so at the end of the episode, McGee begins to suspect that Gibbs may have killed Zolotov to protect her.\n |LineColor       = 36454F\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|NCIS (season 17)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 393\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n |Title           = Lonely Hearts\n |DirectedBy      = Michael Zinberg\n |WrittenBy       = Marco Schnabel\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|11}}\n |Viewers         = 11.75<ref name=\"17.15\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-tuesday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-11-2020.html|title=UPDATED: SHOWBUZZDAILY's Top 150 Tuesday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.11.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|work=Showbuzz Daily|date=February 12, 2020|accessdate=February 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212211933/http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-tuesday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-11-2020.html|archive-date=February 12, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = The lead suspect for the murders of two Marines is a woman that Gibbs' friend, Phillip Brooks ([[Don Lake]]), met on a dating website.

Ziva then bids her farewells to the team as Jimmy prepares to take her to the airport so she can fly to Paris and reunite with her family.\n |LineColor       = 36454F\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|NCIS (season 17)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 390\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n |Title           = Flight Plan\n |DirectedBy      = [[Tawnia McKiernan]]\n |WrittenBy       = Brendan Fehily\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|14}}\n |Viewers         = 10.12<ref name=\"17.12\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tuesday-final-ratings-jan-14-2020/|title=''This is Us'' adjusts up: Tuesday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 15, 2020|accessdate=January 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117191040/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tuesday-final-ratings-jan-14-2020/|archive-date=January 17, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = While investigating the crash of a Navy fighter jet, the team discovers the pilot had faked her death; McGee is concerned about getting a vasectomy.\n |LineColor       = 36454F\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|NCIS (season 17)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 391\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n |Title           = Sound Off\n |DirectedBy      = William Webb\n |WrittenBy       = Lisa Di Trolio\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|21}}\n |Viewers         = 11.36<ref name=\"17.13\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tuesday-final-ratings-jan-21-2020/|title=''NCIS'', ''The Conners'', all others hold: Tuesday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 23, 2020|accessdate=January 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200124015804/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tuesday-final-ratings-jan-21-2020/|archive-date=January 24, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = When the body of a Marine is found at a drone testing site, NCIS must determine if it was murder or an accident.

Flattening the curve relies on mitigation techniques such as [[social distancing]].\n\nA complementary measure is to increase health care capacity, to \"raise the line\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite AV media|type=YouTube video|title=Beating Coronavirus: Flattening the Curve, Raising the Line|author1=Osmosis.org|author2=Lifebridge Health|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7uQwQTRDew|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> As described in an article in [[The Nation|''The Nation'']], \"preventing a health care system from being overwhelmed requires a society to do two things: 'flatten the curve'\u2014that is, slow the rate of infection so there aren\u2019t too many cases that need hospitalization at one time\u2014and 'raise the line'\u2014that is, boost the hospital system's capacity to treat large numbers of patients.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|last=Gelardi|first=Chris|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/puerto-rico-coronavirus/|title=Colonialism Made Puerto Rico Vulnerable to Coronavirus Catastrophe|date=2020-04-09|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref> {{As of|2020|04}}, in the case of the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, two key measures are to increase the numbers of available [[List of countries by hospital beds|ICU beds]] and [[ventilator]]s, which are in [[Shortages related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|systemic shortage]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Background ==\n[[Pandemic predictions and preparations prior to COVID-19|Warnings about the risk of pandemics]] were repeatedly made throughout the 2000s and the 2010s by major international organisations including the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[World Bank]], especially after the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]].<ref name=\"SCMP_world_leaders\" /> Governments, including those in the [[United States]] and [[France]], both prior to the [[2009 swine flu pandemic]], and during the decade following the pandemic, both strengthened their health care capacities and then weakened them.<ref name=\"NYT_lack_of_masks\" /><ref name=\"FR_Senate_lack_of_masks\" /> At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care systems in many countries were functioning near their maximum capacities.<ref name=\":1\" />{{better source|date=April 2020}} In a situation like this, when a sizable new epidemic emerges, a portion of infected and symptomatic patients create an increase in the demand for health care that has only been predicted statistically, without the start date of the epidemic nor the infectivity and lethality known in advance.<ref name=\":1\" /> If the demand surpasses the capacity line in the infections per day curve, then the existing health facilities cannot fully handle the patients, resulting in higher death rates than if preparations had been made.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAn influential UK study showed that an unmitigated [[COVID-19]] response in the UK could have required up to 46 times the number of available [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] beds.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf|title=Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand|last=Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team|date=16 March 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316223332/https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf|archive-date=16 March 2020|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref> The [[Public health|public health management]] challenge is to keep the epidemic wave of incoming patients needing material and human health care resources supplied in a sufficient amount that is considered medically justified.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Impact ==\n[[File:SIR flattening the curve 3variants.svg|alt=|thumb|500x500px|Impact of three different infection rates on susceptible (blue), infected (orange) and recovered (green) individuals.

The Kurds were perceived{{by whom|date=October 2019}} to be subversive elements who would take the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] side in the war. In order to eliminate this threat, Young Turks embarked on a large-scale deportation of Kurds from the regions of ''Djabachdjur'', ''Palu'', ''Musch'', ''Erzurum'' and ''Bitlis''. Around 300,000 Kurds were forced to move southwards to Urfa and then westwards to [[Gaziantep|Aintab]] and [[Kahramanmara\u015f|Marasch]]. In the summer of 1917 Kurds were moved to [[Konya]] in [[central Anatolia]]. Through these measures, the Young Turk [[leader]]s aimed at weakening the political influence of the Kurds by deporting them from their ancestral lands and by dispersing them in small pockets of exiled communities. By the end of World War I, up to 700,000 Kurds had been forcibly deported and almost half of the displaced perished.<ref>Dominik J.

Kurds backed by the United Kingdom declared independence in 1927 and established the [[Republic of Ararat]].

Villagers were faced with a frightening dilemma. They could become village guards and risk being attacked by the PKK or refuse and be forcibly evacuated from their communities. Evacuations were unlawful and violent. Security forces would surround a village using helicopters, armored vehicles, troops, and village guards, and burn stored produce, agricultural equipment, crops, orchards, forests, and livestock. They set fire to houses, often giving the inhabitants no opportunity to retrieve their possessions. During the course of such operations, security forces frequently abused and humiliated villagers, stole their property and cash, and ill-treated or tortured them before herding them onto the roads and away from their former homes. The operations were marked by scores of \"disappearances\" and extrajudicial executions.

Although some of the Kurdish writers' stories were well known throughout Kurdistan; most of the stories told and sung were only written down in the 20th and 21st century. Many of these are, allegedly, centuries old.\n\nWidely varying in purpose and style, among the Kurdish folklore one will find stories about nature, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals, love, heroes and villains, [[mythological]] creatures and everyday life. A number of these mythological figures can be found in other cultures, like the [[Simurgh]] and [[Kaveh the Blacksmith]] in the broader [[Persian mythology|Iranian Mythology]], and stories of [[Shahmaran]] throughout Anatolia. Additionally, stories can be purely entertaining, or have an educational or religious aspect.<ref name=\"Edgecomb\">Edgecomb, D. (2007). ''A Fire in My Heart: Kurdish Tales''. Westport: Libraries Unlimited, pp. 200.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most widely reoccurring element is the fox, which, through cunning and shrewdness triumphs over less intelligent species, yet often also meets his demise.<ref name=\"Edgecomb\" /> Another common theme in Kurdish folklore is the origin of a tribe.\n\nStorytellers would perform in front of an audience, sometimes consisting of an entire village. People from outside the region would travel to attend their narratives, and the storytellers themselves would visit other villages to spread their tales. These would thrive especially during winter, where entertainment was hard to find as evenings had to be spent inside.<ref name=\"Edgecomb\" />\n\nCoinciding with the heterogeneous Kurdish groupings, although certain stories and elements were commonly found throughout Kurdistan, others were unique to a specific area; depending on the region, religion or dialect. The [[Kurdish Jews]] of [[Zakho]] are perhaps the best example of this; their gifted storytellers are known to have been greatly respected throughout the region, thanks to a unique oral tradition.<ref>D.

The most famous Kurdish rugs are [[Bijar rug|those from the Bijar region]], in the Kurdistan Province. Because of the unique way in which the Bijar rugs are woven, they are very stout and durable, hence their appellation as the 'Iron Rugs of Persia'. Exhibiting a wide variety, the Bijar rugs have patterns ranging from floral designs, medallions and animals to other ornaments. They generally have two [[weft]]s, and are very colorful in design.<ref name=\"Claremont Rug Company\">J. D.

They are especially known for their great knot density and high quality mountain wool.<ref name=\"Claremont Rug Company\" /> They lend their name from the region of [[Sanandaj]].

These are especially well known in Iran, most notably the crafts from the [[Kermanshah]] and [[Sanandaj]] regions. Among these crafts are chess boards, talismans, jewelry, ornaments, weaponry, instruments etc.\n\nKurdish blades include a distinct [[jambiya]], with its characteristic I-shaped hilt, and oblong blade. Generally, these possess double-edged blades, reinforced with a central ridge, a wooden, leather or silver decorated scabbard, and a horn hilt, furthermore they are often still worn decoratively by older men. Swords were made as well. Most of these blades in circulation stem from the 19th century.\n\nAnother distinct form of art from Sanandaj is 'Oroosi', a type of window where stylized wooden pieces are locked into each other, rather than being glued together. These are further decorated with coloured glass, this stems from an old belief that if light passes through a combination of seven colours it helps keep the atmosphere clean.\n\nAmong Kurdish Jews a common practice was the making of talismans, which were believed to combat illnesses and protect the wearer from malevolent spirits.\n\n===Tattoos===\n\nAdorning the body with [[tattoo]]s (''deq'' in Kurdish) is widespread among the Kurds; even though permanent tattoos are not permissible in Sunni Islam.

No specific music was associated with the Kurdish princely courts. Instead, music performed in night gatherings (''\u015fevbih\u00eark'') is considered classical. Several musical forms are found in this genre. Many songs are [[Epic poetry|epic]] in nature, such as the popular ''Lawiks'', heroic [[ballad]]s recounting the tales of Kurdish heroes such as [[Saladin]]. ''Heyrans'' are love ballads usually expressing the melancholy of separation and unfulfilled love, one of the first Kurdish female singers to sing heyrans is [[Chopy Fatah]], while ''Lawje'' is a form of religious music and ''Payizoks'' are songs performed during the autumn. Love songs, dance music, wedding and other celebratory songs (''d\u00eelok/nar\u00eenk''), erotic poetry, and [[work song]]s are also popular.\n\nThroughout the Middle East, there are many prominent Kurdish artists. Most famous are [[Ibrahim Tatlises]], [[Nizamettin Ar\u0131\u00e7]], [[Ahmet Kaya]] and the [[Kamkars]]. In Europe, well-known artists are [[Darin Zanyar]], [[Sivan Perwer]], and [[Azad (rapper)|Azad]].\n\n===Cinema===\n{{Main|Kurdish cinema}}\n[[File:BahmanGhobadi2009.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bahman Ghobadi]] at the presentation of his film ''Nobody Knows About Persian Cats'' in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]], 2009]]\n\nThe main themes of [[Kurdish cinema|Kurdish Cinema]] are the poverty and hardship which ordinary Kurds have to endure. The first films featuring Kurdish culture were actually shot in Armenia. Zare, released in 1927, produced by [[Hamo Beknazarian]], details the story of Zare and her love for the shepherd Seydo, and the difficulties the two experience by the hand of the village elder.<ref>IMDB '[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184075/ Zare (1927)]' Retrieved 7 July 2013.</ref>\nIn 1948 and 1959, two documentaries were made concerning the Yezidi Kurds in Armenia. These were joint Armenian-Kurdish productions; with H. Ko\u00e7aryan and Heciye Cindi teaming up for ''The Kurds of Soviet Armenia'',<ref name=\"Kurdish Cinema\">R. Alakom '[http://www.kurdishcinema.com/RohatAlakomZere.html The first film about Kurds]'. Retrieved 7 July 2013.</ref> and Ereb Samilov and C. Jamharyan for ''Kurds of Armenia''.<ref name=\"Kurdish Cinema\" />\n\nThe first critically acclaimed and famous Kurdish films were produced by [[Y\u0131lmaz G\u00fcney]]. Initially a popular, award-winning actor in Turkey with the nickname ''\u00c7irkin Kral'' (''the Ugly King'', after his rough looks), he spent the later part of his career producing socio-critical and politically loaded films. ''[[S\u00fcr\u00fc]]'' (1979), ''[[Yol]]'' (1982) and ''[[Duvar]]'' (1983) are his best-known works, of which the second won Palme d'Or at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] of 1982,<ref>{{cite book|author=DVD ~ Yilmaz G\u00fcney |title=Yol (1982) |asin=6302824435 }}</ref> the most prestigious award in the world of cinema.\n\nAnother prominent Kurdish film director is [[Bahman Qubadi]]. His first feature film was ''[[A Time for Drunken Horses]]'', released in 2000. It was critically acclaimed, and went on to win multiple awards. Other movies of his would follow this example,<ref>IMDB '[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315842/awards Bahman Ghobadi's Awards]'. Retrieved 7 July 2013.</ref> making him one of the best known film producers of Iran of today. Recently, he released ''[[Rhinos Season]]'', starring [[Behrouz Vossoughi]], [[Monica Bellucci]] and [[Yilmaz Erdogan]], detailing the tumultuous life of a Kurdish poet.\n\nOther prominent Kurdish film directors that are critically acclaimed include [[Mahsun K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131g\u00fcl]], [[Hiner Saleem]] and the aforementioned Yilmaz Erdogan. There's also been a number of films set and/or filmed in Kurdistan made by non-Kurdish film directors, such as ''[[The Wind Will Carry Us]]'', ''[[Triage (film)|Triage]]'', ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and ''[[The Market: A Tale of Trade]]''.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:080603 Derdiyok.jpg|thumb|[[Eren Derdiyok]], the most famous contemporary Kurdish footballer, striker for the [[Swiss national football team]]]]\n\nThe most popular sport among the Kurds is football. Because the Kurds have no independent state, they have no representative team in [[FIFA]] or the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]]; however a team representing [[Iraqi Kurdistan national football team|Iraqi Kurdistan]] has been active in the [[Viva World Cup]] since 2008. They became runners-up in 2009 and 2010, before ultimately becoming champion in 2012.\n\nOn a national level, the Kurdish clubs of Iraq have achieved success in recent years as well, winning the [[Iraqi Premier League]] four times in the last five years. Prominent clubs are [[Erbil SC]], [[Duhok SC]], [[Sulaymaniyah FC]] and [[Zakho FC]].\n\nIn Turkey, a Kurd named [[Celal Ibrahim]] was one of the founders of [[Galatasaray S.K.]] in 1905, as well as one of the original players. The most prominent Kurdish-Turkish club is [[Diyarbakirspor]]. In the diaspora, the most successful Kurdish club is [[Dalkurd FF]] and the most famous player is [[Eren Derdiyok]].<ref>FIFA '[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/players/player=294749/profile.html Eren Derdiyok's Profile]'  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113003014/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/players/player%3D294749/profile.html |date=13 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nAnother prominent sport is wrestling.

However, houses with a beehive-like roof, not unlike those in [[Harran]], are also present.\n\nOver the centuries many Kurdish architectural marvels have been erected, with varying styles. Kurdistan boasts many examples from ancient Iranian, Roman, Greek and Semitic origin, most famous of these include [[Bisotun]] and [[Taq-e Bostan]] in Kermanshah, [[Takht-e Soleyman]] near Takab, [[Mount Nemrud]] near Adiyaman and the citadels of Erbil and Diyarbakir.\n\nThe first genuinely Kurdish examples extant were built in the 11th century.

Although some of the Kurdish writers' stories were well known throughout Kurdistan; most of the stories told and sung were only written down in the 20th and 21st century. Many of these are, allegedly, centuries old.\n\nWidely varying in purpose and style, among the Kurdish folklore one will find stories about nature, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals, love, heroes and villains, [[mythological]] creatures and everyday life. A number of these mythological figures can be found in other cultures, like the [[Simurgh]] and [[Kaveh the Blacksmith]] in the broader [[Persian mythology|Iranian Mythology]], and stories of [[Shahmaran]] throughout Anatolia. Additionally, stories can be purely entertaining, or have an educational or religious aspect.<ref name=\"Edgecomb\">Edgecomb, D. (2007). ''A Fire in My Heart: Kurdish Tales''. Westport: Libraries Unlimited, pp. 200.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most widely reoccurring element is the fox, which, through cunning and shrewdness triumphs over less intelligent species, yet often also meets his demise.<ref name=\"Edgecomb\" /> Another common theme in Kurdish folklore is the origin of a tribe.\n\nStorytellers would perform in front of an audience, sometimes consisting of an entire village. People from outside the region would travel to attend their narratives, and the storytellers themselves would visit other villages to spread their tales. These would thrive especially during winter, where entertainment was hard to find as evenings had to be spent inside.<ref name=\"Edgecomb\" />\n\nCoinciding with the heterogeneous Kurdish groupings, although certain stories and elements were commonly found throughout Kurdistan, others were unique to a specific area; depending on the region, religion or dialect. The [[Kurdish Jews]] of [[Zakho]] are perhaps the best example of this; their gifted storytellers are known to have been greatly respected throughout the region, thanks to a unique oral tradition.<ref>D.

The most famous Kurdish rugs are [[Bijar rug|those from the Bijar region]], in the Kurdistan Province. Because of the unique way in which the Bijar rugs are woven, they are very stout and durable, hence their appellation as the 'Iron Rugs of Persia'. Exhibiting a wide variety, the Bijar rugs have patterns ranging from floral designs, medallions and animals to other ornaments. They generally have two [[weft]]s, and are very colorful in design.<ref name=\"Claremont Rug Company\">J. D. Winitz '[http://www.claremontrug.com/educational-center/rugtypes/kurdish.aspx Kurdish Rugs]'. Retrieved 7 July 2013.</ref> With an increased interest in these rugs in the last century, and a lesser need for them to be as sturdy as they were, new Bijar rugs are more refined and delicate in design.\n\nAnother well-known Kurdish rug is the Senneh rug, which is regarded as the most sophisticated of the Kurdish rugs. They are especially known for their great knot density and high quality mountain wool.<ref name=\"Claremont Rug Company\" /> They lend their name from the region of [[Sanandaj]]. Throughout other Kurdish regions like [[Kermanshah]], [[Siirt]], [[Malatya]] and [[Bitlis]] rugs were also woven to great extent.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eagleton | first1 = W. | year = 1989 | title = The Emergence of a Kurdish Rug Type | url = | journal = Oriental Rug Review | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 5 }}</ref>\n\nKurdish bags are mainly known from the works of one large tribe: the [[Jaff (Kurdish tribe)|Jaff]]s, living in the border area between Iran and Iraq.

These are especially well known in Iran, most notably the crafts from the [[Kermanshah]] and [[Sanandaj]] regions. Among these crafts are chess boards, talismans, jewelry, ornaments, weaponry, instruments etc.\n\nKurdish blades include a distinct [[jambiya]], with its characteristic I-shaped hilt, and oblong blade. Generally, these possess double-edged blades, reinforced with a central ridge, a wooden, leather or silver decorated scabbard, and a horn hilt, furthermore they are often still worn decoratively by older men. Swords were made as well. Most of these blades in circulation stem from the 19th century.\n\nAnother distinct form of art from Sanandaj is 'Oroosi', a type of window where stylized wooden pieces are locked into each other, rather than being glued together. These are further decorated with coloured glass, this stems from an old belief that if light passes through a combination of seven colours it helps keep the atmosphere clean.\n\nAmong Kurdish Jews a common practice was the making of talismans, which were believed to combat illnesses and protect the wearer from malevolent spirits.\n\n===Tattoos===\n\nAdorning the body with [[tattoo]]s (''deq'' in Kurdish) is widespread among the Kurds; even though permanent tattoos are not permissible in Sunni Islam. Therefore, these traditional tattoos are thought to derive from pre-Islamic times.<ref name=\"Immigration Museum\">{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/pages/14387/kurds-in-australia-brochure.pdf?epslanguage=en |format=PDF |publisher=Museumvictoria.com.au |title=Immigration Museum (2010) Survival of a culture: Kurds in Australia |accessdate=7 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326153229/http://museumvictoria.com.au/pages/14387/kurds-in-australia-brochure.pdf?epslanguage=en |archive-date=26 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nTattoo ink is made by mixing [[soot]] with (breast) milk and the poisonous liquid from the gall bladder of an animal. The design is drawn on the skin using a thin twig and is, by needle, penetrated under the skin. These have a wide variety of meanings and purposes, among which are protection against evil or illnesses; beauty enhancement; and the showing of tribal affiliations. [[Religious symbolism]] is also common among both traditional and modern Kurdish tattoos.

No specific music was associated with the Kurdish princely courts. Instead, music performed in night gatherings (''\u015fevbih\u00eark'') is considered classical. Several musical forms are found in this genre. Many songs are [[Epic poetry|epic]] in nature, such as the popular ''Lawiks'', heroic [[ballad]]s recounting the tales of Kurdish heroes such as [[Saladin]]. ''Heyrans'' are love ballads usually expressing the melancholy of separation and unfulfilled love, one of the first Kurdish female singers to sing heyrans is [[Chopy Fatah]], while ''Lawje'' is a form of religious music and ''Payizoks'' are songs performed during the autumn. Love songs, dance music, wedding and other celebratory songs (''d\u00eelok/nar\u00eenk''), erotic poetry, and [[work song]]s are also popular.\n\nThroughout the Middle East, there are many prominent Kurdish artists. Most famous are [[Ibrahim Tatlises]], [[Nizamettin Ar\u0131\u00e7]], [[Ahmet Kaya]] and the [[Kamkars]]. In Europe, well-known artists are [[Darin Zanyar]], [[Sivan Perwer]], and [[Azad (rapper)|Azad]].\n\n===Cinema===\n{{Main|Kurdish cinema}}\n[[File:BahmanGhobadi2009.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bahman Ghobadi]] at the presentation of his film ''Nobody Knows About Persian Cats'' in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]], 2009]]\n\nThe main themes of [[Kurdish cinema|Kurdish Cinema]] are the poverty and hardship which ordinary Kurds have to endure.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 24th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled for release in the United States on November 6, 2020, as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU. Its release was delayed from an original May 2020 date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

''\u00c6on Flux'' didn't open well, and three days after it opened, the studio said, 'We don't think it's time to do this movie.'\"|source=\u2014David Hayter on his version of the script and why that project failed to move forward.<ref name=\"HayterNov2011\" />}}\nIn February 2004, [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] acquired the film rights for [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]],<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\" /> and in April announced [[David Hayter]] as writer and director of the film, with [[Marvel Studios]]' [[Avi Arad]] producing.<ref name=\"HayterDirectWrite\" /> By June 2006, Lionsgate had dropped the project and the rights reverted to Marvel Studios. Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> In early April, Disney announced that ''Black Widow'' would now be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] slate of films were shifted back to accommodate this change.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was believed to be composing music for the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nThe final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 6, 2020.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]],<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> and will be the first film released in Phase Four of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseFour\" /><ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2020.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In early March 2020, after the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] had caused the closure of theaters in many Asian countries, the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted from April 2020 to November 2020. Commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' to be postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed at that time with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed. He said this was \"the logical choice at this juncture\", feeling the film was \"already in its ideal release date\" and there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S.<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]. Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise. A Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline, and they speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" /> In April, Disney changed its entire Phase Four release slate, giving ''The Eternals''{{'}} November 2020 release date to ''Black Widow'' and shifting all its other Phase Four films back in the schedule to accommodate this.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 24th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled for release in the United States on November 6, 2020, as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU. Its release was delayed from an original May 2020 date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

''\u00c6on Flux'' didn't open well, and three days after it opened, the studio said, 'We don't think it's time to do this movie.'\"|source=\u2014David Hayter on his version of the script and why that project failed to move forward.<ref name=\"HayterNov2011\" />}}\nIn February 2004, [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] acquired the film rights for [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]],<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\" /> and in April announced [[David Hayter]] as writer and director of the film, with [[Marvel Studios]]' [[Avi Arad]] producing.<ref name=\"HayterDirectWrite\" /> By June 2006, Lionsgate had dropped the project and the rights reverted to Marvel Studios. Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> In early April, Disney announced that ''Black Widow'' would now be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] slate of films were shifted back to accommodate this change.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was believed to be composing music for the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nThe final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 6, 2020.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]],<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> and will be the first film released in Phase Four of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseFour\" /><ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2020.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In early March 2020, after the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] had caused the closure of theaters in many Asian countries, the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted from April 2020 to November 2020. Commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' to be postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed at that time with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed. He said this was \"the logical choice at this juncture\", feeling the film was \"already in its ideal release date\" and there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S.<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]. Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise. A Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline, and they speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" /> In April, Disney changed its entire Phase Four release slate, giving ''The Eternals''{{'}} November 2020 release date to ''Black Widow'' and shifting all its other Phase Four films back in the schedule to accommodate this.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite
