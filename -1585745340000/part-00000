The birth rate was high and the population almost doubled between 1947 and 1989.

[[Joseph Stalin]], whose [[Red Army]] occupied the entire country, presented several alternatives which granted Poland [[Recovered territories|industrialized territories]] in the west whilst the Red Army simultaneously permanently annexed Polish [[Kresy|territories in the east]], resulting in Poland losing over 20% of its [[Second Polish Republic|pre-war borders]]. Stalin then imposed upon Poland a Soviet-backed puppet communist government following the war, forcibly bringing the nation into the [[Soviet Empire|Soviet sphere of influence]].]]\n\nAt the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] was able to present his western allies, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]], with a ''[[fait accompli]]'' in Poland. His armed forces were in occupation of the country, and the communists were in control of its administration. The [[Soviet Union]] was in the process of incorporating the lands to the east of the [[Curzon Line]], which it had [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded and occupied between 1939 and 1941]].\n\nIn compensation, the USSR gave Poland former German populated territories in [[Pomerania]], [[Silesia]], and [[Brandenburg]] east of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]], plus the southern half of [[East Prussia]]. These awards were confirmed at the Tripartite Conference of Berlin, otherwise known as the [[Potsdam Conference]] in August 1945 after the end of the war in Europe. Stalin was determined that Poland's new government would become his tool towards making Poland a Soviet puppet state controlled by the communists. He had severed relations with the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London in 1943, but to appease Roosevelt and Churchill he agreed at Yalta that a coalition government would be formed. The communists held a majority of key posts in this new government, and with Soviet support they soon gained almost total control of the country, rigging all elections.\n\nIn June 1946, the \"[[Three Times Yes]]\" referendum was held on a number of issues\u2014abolition of the [[Senate of Poland]], land reform, and making the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] Poland's western border. The communist-controlled Interior Ministry issued results showing that all three questions passed overwhelmingly. Years later, however, evidence was uncovered showing that the referendum had been tainted by massive fraud, and only the third question actually passed.<ref>Czes\u0142aw Os\u0119kowski ''Referendum 30 czerwca 1946 roku w Polsce'', Wydawnictwo Sejmowe, 2000, {{ISBN|83-7059-459-X}}</ref>  [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] then took advantage of a split in the [[Polish Socialist Party]].  One faction, which included [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski]], wanted to join forces with the Peasant Party and form a united front against the Communists. Another faction, led by [[J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz]], argued that the Socialists should support the Communists in carrying through a socialist program, while opposing the imposition of one-party rule. Pre-war political hostilities continued to influence events, and [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] would not agree to form a united front with the Socialists. The Communists played on these divisions by dismissing Os\u00f3bka-Morawski and making Cyrankiewicz Prime Minister.\n\nBetween the referendum and the [[1947 Polish legislative election|January 1947 general elections]], the opposition was subjected to persecution.  Only the candidates of the pro-government \"Democratic Bloc\" (the PPR, Cyrankiewicz' faction of the PPS, and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]]) were allowed to campaign completely unmolested.  Meanwhile, several opposition candidates were prevented from campaigning at all. Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u201349)|Polish People's Party]] (PSL) in particular suffered persecution; it had opposed the abolition of the Senate as a test of strength against the government.  Although it supported the other two questions, the Communist-dominated government branded the PSL \"traitors\".  This massive oppression was overseen by Gomu\u0142ka and the provisional president, [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]].\n\n[[File:Westverschiebung.Polens.gif|thumb|left|Border changes of Poland after [[World War II]]. The eastern territories (''[[Kresy]]'') were annexed by the Soviets. The western so-called \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" were granted as war reparations. Despite the western lands being more industrialized, Poland lost 77,035 km<sup>2</sup> (29,743 sq mi) and major cities like [[Lviv]] and [[Vilnius]].]]\n\nThe official results of the election showed the Democratic Bloc with 80.1 percent of the vote.  The Democratic Bloc was awarded 394 seats to only 28 for the PSL. Miko\u0142ajczyk immediately resigned to protest this so-called 'implausible result', and fled to the United Kingdom in April rather than face arrest.  Later, some historians announced that the official results were only obtained through massive fraud.  Government officials didn't even count the real votes in many areas, and simply filled in the relevant documents in accordance with instructions from the Communists.  In other areas, the ballot boxes were either destroyed or replaced with boxes containing prefilled ballots.\n\nThe 1947 election marked the beginning of undisguised Communist rule in Poland, though it was not officially transformed into the Polish People's Republic until the adoption of the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|1952 Constitution]].  However, Gomu\u0142ka never supported Stalin's control over the Polish Communists, and was soon replaced as party leader by the more pliable Bierut.  In 1948, the Communists consolidated their power, merging with Cyrankiewicz' faction of the PPS to form the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (known in Poland as 'the Party'), which would monopolise political power in Poland until 1989. In 1949, Polish-born Soviet Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] became the Minister of National Defence, with the additional title [[Marshal of Poland]], and in 1952 he became Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers (deputy premier).\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = 3xtak.jpg\n | caption1 = A propaganda poster enhancing to vote for Communist policies in the \"[[Three Times Yes]]\" 1946 referendum\n | image2 = Konstytucja PRL draft with Stalin remarks.jpg\n | caption2 = Draft of [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]] (Russian version) with Stalin's remarks, 1952\n}}\n\nOver the coming years, private industry was [[nationalisation|nationalised]], the land seized from the pre-war landowners and redistributed to the lower-class farmers, and millions of Poles were transferred from the lost eastern territories to the lands acquired from Germany. Poland was now to be brought into line with the Soviet model of a \"people's democracy\" and a centrally planned socialist economy. The government also embarked on the [[collectivisation]] of agriculture, although the pace was slower than in other satellites: Poland remained the only Eastern Bloc country where individual farmers dominated agriculture.\n\nThrough a careful balance of agreement, compromise and resistance \u2014 and having signed an agreement of coexistence with the communist regime \u2014 [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[primate (bishop)|primate]] [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] maintained and even strengthened the Polish church through a series of failed government leaders.

In June, workers in the industrial city of [[Pozna\u0144]] went on strike, in what became known as [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]]. Voices began to be raised in the Party and among the intellectuals calling for wider reforms of the Stalinist system. Eventually, power shifted towards Gomu\u0142ka, who replaced Ochab as party leader. Hardline Stalinists were removed from power and many Soviet officers serving in the [[Polish Army]] were dismissed. This marked the end of the Stalinist era.\n\n=== 1970s and 1980s ===\n[[File:Polish 1970 protests - Zbyszek Godlewski body.jpg|thumb|left|The [[1970 Polish protests]] were ruthlessly crushed by the Communist authorities and [[Milicja Obywatelska|Citizens' Militia]]. The riots resulted in the deaths of 42 people and over 1,000 injured.]]\nIn 1970, Gomu\u0142ka's government had decided to adopt massive increases in the prices of basic goods, including food. The resulting widespread [[Polish 1970 protests|violent protests]] in December that same year resulted in a number of deaths. They also forced another major change in the government, as Gomu\u0142ka was replaced by [[Edward Gierek]] as the new First Secretary. Gierek's plan for recovery was centered on massive borrowing, mainly from the United States and [[West Germany]], to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers some incentive to work. While it boosted the Polish economy, and is still remembered as the \"Golden Age\" of socialist Poland, it left the country vulnerable to global economic fluctuations and western undermining, and the repercussions in the form of massive debt is still felt in Poland even today. This Golden Age came to an end after the [[1973 energy crisis]]. The failure of the Gierek government, both economically and politically, soon led to the creation of opposition in the form of [[trade union]]s, student groups, clandestine newspapers and publishers, imported books and newspapers, and even a \"flying university.\"\n\n[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|250px|Queues waiting to enter state-run grocery stores in Warsaw and other Polish cities and towns were a typical sight in the 1950s and 1980s. The availability of food and goods varied at times, and the most sought after basic item was toilet paper.]]\n\nOn 16 October 1978, the [[Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Karol Wojty\u0142a, was [[Papal conclave, October 1978|elected Pope]], taking the name [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. The election of a Polish Pope had an electrifying effect on what had been, even under Communist rule, one of the most devoutly Catholic nations in Europe. Gierek is alleged to have said to his cabinet, \"O God, what are we going to do now?\" or, as occasionally reported, \"Jesus and Mary, this is the end\". When John Paul II made his first papal tour of Poland in June 1979, half a million people heard him speak in Warsaw; he did not call for rebellion, but instead encouraged the creation of an \"alternative Poland\" of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next economic crisis came, the nation would present a united front.\n\nA new wave of labour strikes undermined Gierek's government, and in September Gierek, who was in poor health, was finally removed from office and replaced as Party leader by [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]]. However, Kania was unable to find an answer for the fast-eroding support of communism in Poland. Labour turmoil led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (''Solidarno\u015b\u0107'') in September 1980, originally led by [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]. In fact, Solidarity became a broad [[anti-communist]] social movement ranging from people associated with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], to members of the anti-Stalinist left. By the end of 1981, Solidarity had nine million members\u2014a quarter of Poland's population and three times as many as the PUWP had. Kania resigned under Soviet pressure in October and was succeeded by [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who had been Defence minister since 1968 and Premier since February.\n\n[[File:Warszawa 1975 WDC 42783.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The new [[Warszawa Centralna railway station]] in [[Warsaw]] had automatic doors and escalators, an unlikely sight in Communist Poland.

This sudden crackdown on Solidarity was reportedly out of fear of Soviet intervention (see [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980\u201381]]). The government then disallowed Solidarity on 8 October 1982. Martial law was formally lifted in July 1983, though many heightened controls on civil liberties and political life, as well as food rationing, remained in place through the mid-to-late-1980s. Jaruzelski stepped down as prime minister in 1985 and became president (chairman of the Council of State).\n\n[[File:Stakingsleider Lech Walesa deelt handtekeningen uit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] co-founded and headed the [[Solidarno\u015b\u0107|Solidarity movement]] which toppled Communism.

Eventually it eroded the dominance of the PUWP, which in 1981 lost approximately 85,000 of its 3 million members. Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persisted solely as an underground organization, but by the late 1980s was sufficiently strong to frustrate Jaruzelski's attempts at reform, and nationwide [[1988 Polish strikes|strike]]s in 1988 were one of the factors that forced the government to open a dialogue with Solidarity.\n\nFrom 6 February to 15 April 1989, talks of 13 [[working group]]s in 94 sessions, which became known as the \"[[Polish Round Table Agreement|Roundtable Talks]]\" (''Rozmowy Okr\u0105g\u0142ego Sto\u0142u'') saw the PUWP abandon power and radically altered the shape of the country. In June, shortly after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] in China, the [[1989 Polish legislative election]] took place. Much to its own surprise, Solidarity took all contested (35%) seats in the [[Sejm]], the Parliament's lower house, and all but one seat in the fully free elected [[Senate of Poland|Senate]].\n\nSolidarity persuaded the Communists' longtime satellite parties, the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] and Democratic Party, to throw their support to Solidarity.  This all but forced Jaruzelski, who had been named president in July, to appoint a Solidarity member as prime minister.  Finally, he appointed a Solidarity-led coalition government with [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] as the country's first non-Communist prime minister since 1948.\n\nOn 10 December 1989, the [[List of statues of Vladimir Lenin|statue]] of [[Vladimir Lenin]] was removed in [[Warsaw]] by the PRL authorities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Upheaval in the East; Lenin Statue in Mothballs |author=Reuters |date=11 December 1989 |work=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/11/world/upheaval-in-the-east-lenin-statue-in-mothballs.html }}</ref>\n\nThe Parliament amended the Constitution on 29 December 1989 to formally restore democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties. This began the [[Third Polish Republic]], and served as a prelude to the fully democratic elections of [[1991 Polish parliamentary election|1991]]\u2014only the third free election ever held in Poland.\n\nThe PZPR was finally disbanded on 30 January 1990, even if Wa\u0142\u0119sa could be elected as President only eleven months after. The [[Warsaw Pact]] was soon followed on 1 July 1991 and the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991. On 27 October 1991, the [[1991 Polish parliamentary election|first entirely free Polish parliamentary elections]] since the 1920s took place. This completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style [[Parliamentary system|liberal democratic political system]]. The last [[Northern Group of Forces|post-Soviet troops]] left Poland on 18 September 1993. After ten years of [[democratic consolidation]], Poland joined [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] in 1996, [[NATO]] in 1999 and the [[European Union]] in 2004.\n\n== Government and politics ==\n{{see also|Politics of Poland}}\n[[File:POL PZPR logo.svg|thumb|upright=0.60|right|Logo of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]]]]\n\nThe government and politics of the Polish People's Republic were governed by the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (''Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza, PZPR''). Despite the presence of two minor parties, the United People's Party and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]], the country was generally reckoned by western nations as a [[one-party state]] because these two parties were supposedly completely subservient to the Communists and had to accept the PZPR's \"leading role\" as a condition of their existence.  It was dependent on the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] to the extent of being its [[satellite state]]. From 1952, the PRP's highest law was the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]], and the [[Polish Council of State]] replaced the [[president of Poland|presidency of Poland]]. Elections were held on the single lists of the [[Front of National Unity]].\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{see also|Foreign relations of Poland}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0417-0001-011, Berlin, VII.

It also had friendly relations with the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and the [[Western Bloc]] as well as the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\nPRL's [[Israel\u2013Poland relations|relations]] with [[Israel]] were on a fair level following the aftermath of the Holocaust. In 1947, the PRL voted in favour of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], which lead to Israel's recognition by the PRL on 19 May 1948. However, by the [[Six-Day War]], it severed diplomatic relations with Israel in June 1967 and supported the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] which [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|recognized]] the [[State of Palestine]] on 14 December 1988. In 1989, PRL restored relations with Israel.\n\nThe PRL participated as a member of the [[United Nations|UN]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Warsaw Pact]], [[Comecon]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], and [[Interkosmos]].\n\n== Economy ==\n{{further|Economy of Poland|Eastern Bloc economies}}\n\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:Kroscienko PGR 1.jpg|thumb|right|An abandoned [[State Agricultural Farm]] in south-eastern Poland. State farms were a form of [[collective farming]] created in 1949.]]\nPoland suffered tremendous economic losses during World War II. In 1939, Poland had 35.1 million inhabitants, but the census of 14 February 1946 showed only 23.9 million inhabitants. (The difference was partially the result of the border revision.) The losses in national resources and infrastructure amounted to 38%. Compared to [[Western Europe]]an nations, including Germany, Poland was still mostly an agrarian country. The implementation of the immense tasks involved with the reconstruction of the country was intertwined with the struggle of the new government for the stabilisation of power, made even more difficult by the fact that a considerable part of society was mistrustful of the communist government. The occupation of Poland by the Red Army and the support the Soviet Union had shown for the Polish communists was decisive in the communists gaining the upper hand in the new Polish government. Poland was under Soviet control, both directly (Red Army, [[NKVD]], deportations to the SU) and indirectly (NKVD created the Polish political police UB).\n\n[[File:Bazylika Archikatedralna w \u0141odzi.jpg|thumb|left|[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] was Poland's largest city after the destruction of [[Warsaw]] during [[World War II]]. It was also a major industrial centre in Europe and served as the temporary capital due to its economic significance in the 1940s.]]\n\nAs control of the Polish territories passed from occupying forces of [[Nazi Germany]] to the subsequent occupying forces of the [[Soviet Union]], and from the Soviet Union to the Soviet-imposed puppet [[satellite state]], Poland's new [[economic system]] was forcibly imposed and began moving towards a radical, communist [[central planning|centrally planned]] economy. One of the first major steps in that direction involved the [[agricultural reform]] issued by the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] government on 6 September 1944. All estates over 0.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in pre-war Polish territories and all over 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in former German territories were nationalised without compensation. In total, 31,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of land were nationalised in Poland and 5 million in the former German territories, out of which 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> were redistributed to farmers and the rest remained in the hands of the government (Most of this was eventually used in the [[collectivization]] and creation of [[sovkhoz]]-like [[State Agricultural Farm]]s \"PGR\"). However, the collectivization of Polish farming never reached the same extent as it did in the Soviet Union or other countries of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"PWN-Reforma\">Wojciech Roszkowski, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060407135210/http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/62528_1.html  Reforma Rolna] Encyklopedia.PWN.pl (Internet Archive)</ref>\n\n[[File:Ignacy P\u0142a\u017cewski, Prz\u0105dki przy pracy, I-4717-4.jpg|thumb|right|Female [[textile]] workers in a state-run factory, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, 1950s]]\n\n[[Nationalisation]] began in 1944, with the pro-Soviet government taking over industries in the newly acquired territories along with the rest of the country. As nationalization was unpopular, the communists delayed [[Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic|the nationalization reform]] until 1946, when after the [[3xTAK]] [[referendum]]s they were fairly certain they had total control of the state and could deal a heavy blow to eventual public protests. Some semi-official nationalisation of various private enterprises had begun also in 1944. In 1946, all enterprises with over 50 employees were nationalised, with no compensation to Polish owners.<ref name=\"PWN-Nacjonalizacja\">Zbigniew Landau, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050324055335/http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/49495_1.html  Nacjonalizacja w Polsce] Encyklopedia.PWN.pl (Internet Archive)</ref>\n\nThe Allied punishment of Germany for the war of destruction was intended to include large-scale reparations to Poland. However, those were truncated into insignificance by the break-up of Germany into East and West and the onset of the Cold War. Poland was then relegated to receive her share from the Soviet-controlled [[East Germany]]. However, even this was attenuated, as the Soviets pressured the Polish Government to cease receiving the reparations far ahead of schedule as a sign of 'friendship' between the two new communist neighbors and, therefore, now friends.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fHYh1QxFnFwC&pg=PA230&lpg=PA230&dq=working+with+the+enemy+Poland+Soviet+1953 |title=Working for the enemy: Ford, General Motors, and forced labor in Germany during the Second World War |isbn=978-1-84545-013-7 |author1=Billstein |first1=Reinhold |last2=Fings |first2=Karola |last3=Kugler |first3=Anita |last4=Levis |first4=Billstein |date=October 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"Hofhansel\">{{Cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ea-j1w5Z17kC&pg=RA1-PA56&lpg=RA1-PA56&dq=multilateralism+Poland+Soviet+German+reparations+1953 |title=Multilateralism, German foreign policy and Central Europe |isbn=978-0-415-36406-5 |author1=Hofhansel |first1=Claus |year=2005 |format=Google Books, no preview}}&nbsp;{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref> Thus, without the reparations and without the massive [[Marshall Plan]] implemented in the West at that time, Poland's postwar recovery was much harder than it could have been.\n\n=== Later years ===\n[[File:SuperSam Warszawa 1969.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supersam Warsaw]], the first self-serve shopping centre in Poland, 1969]]\nDuring the [[Gierek decade|Gierek era]], Poland borrowed large sums from [[Club de Paris|Western creditors]] in exchange for promise of social and economic reforms.

However, it could not simply be exchanged at the official banks for Polish [[z\u0142oty]]s, since the government exchange rate undervalued the dollar and placed heavy restrictions on the amount that could be exchanged, and so the only practical way to obtain it was from [[remittances]] or work outside the country. An entire illegal industry of street-corner money changers emerged as a result. The so-called ''Cinkciarze'' gave clients far better than official exchange rate and became wealthy from their opportunism albeit at the risk of punishment, usually diminished by the wide scale bribery of the Militia.<ref name=\"Szama\u0144ska-2008\"/>\n\nAs Western currency came into the country from emigrant families and foreign workers, the government in turn attempted to gather it up by various means, most visibly by establishing a chain of state-run ''[[Pewex]]'' and ''Baltona'' stores in all Polish cities, where goods could only be bought with hard currency.

Most visibly, work on most of the major investment projects that had begun in the 1970s was stopped. As a result, most Polish cities acquired at least one infamous example of a large unfinished building languishing in a state of limbo. While some of these were eventually finished decades later, most, such as the [[Szkieletor]] [[skyscraper]] in Krak\u00f3w, were never finished at all, wasting the considerable resources devoted to their construction. Polish investment in economic infrastructure and technological development fell rapidly, ensuring that the country lost whatever ground it had gained relative to Western European economies in the 1970s. To escape the constant economic and political pressures during these years, and the general sense of hopelessness, many family income providers traveled for work in Western Europe, particularly West Germany (''Wyjazd na saksy'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/saksy|title=saksy \u2013 Wikis\u0142ownik, wolny s\u0142ownik wieloj\u0119zyczny|website=pl.wiktionary.org|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref> During the era, hundreds of thousands of Poles left the country permanently and settled in the West, few of them returning to Poland even after the end of socialism in Poland.

The government introduced a series of small-scale reforms, such as allowing more small-scale private enterprises to function. However, the government also realized that it lacked the legitimacy to carry out any large-scale reforms, which would inevitably cause large-scale social dislocation and economic difficulties for most of the population, accustomed to the extensive [[social safety net]] that the socialist system had provided. For example, when the government proposed to close the [[Gda\u0144sk Shipyard]], a decision in some ways justifiable from an economic point of view but also largely political, there was a wave of public outrage and the government was forced to back down.\n\nThe only way to carry out such changes without social upheaval would be to acquire at least some support from the opposition side. The government accepted the idea that some kind of a deal with the opposition would be necessary, and repeatedly attempted to find common ground throughout the 1980s. However, at this point the communists generally still believed that they should retain the reins of power for the near future, and only allowed the opposition limited, advisory participation in the running of the country. They believed that this would be essential to pacifying the Soviet Union, which they felt was not yet ready to accept a non-Communist Poland.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{main|Culture in the Polish People's Republic}}\n===Television and media===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width1 = 220\n | width2 = 220\n | image1 = Dziennik telewizyjny.jpg\n | alt1 = Dziennik\n | image2 = Dziennik-telewizyjny-Intro.ogg\n | alt2 = Dziennik\n | footer = Opening panel and sequence of ''[[Dziennik Telewizyjny|Dziennik]]'', the chief news program in communist Poland.

Furthermore, the pre-war system of education was in disarray; many educational facilities were much more accessible in wealthier western and central Poland than in the rural east (Kresy), particularly in the [[Polesie]] region where there was one large school per 100 square kilometers (39 square miles).<ref name=\"auto8\">{{Cite web|url=https://niepodlegla.gov.pl/o-niepodleglej/edukacja-w-ii-rzeczypospolitej/|title=Edukacja w II Rzeczypospolitej|website=Niepodleg\u0142a - stulecie odzyskania niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci}}</ref> Schools were also in desperate need of staff, tutors and teachers before 1939.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> \n\nAfter the [[1947 Polish legislative election]], the communists took full control of the education in the newly-formed Polish People's Republic.

The communist government also introduced new beneficial content into the system; sports and [[physical education]] were enforced and students were encouraged to learn foreign languages, especially German, Russian or French and from the 1980s also English. On July 15, 1961, two-year [[vocational education|vocational career training]] was made obligatory to boost the number of skilled labourers and the minimum age of graduation rose to 15. Additionally, special schools were established for deaf, [[muteness|mute]] and blind children. Such institutions for the impaired were almost nonexistent in the Second Polish Republic. During the 1960s, thousands of modern schools were founded. \n\nThe number of universities nearly doubled between 1938 and 1963. Medical, agricultural, economical, engineering and sport faculties became separate colleges, under a universal communist model used in other countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Theological]] faculties were deemed unnecessary or potentially dangerous and were therefore removed from state universities. [[Philosophy]] was also seen as superfluous. In order to strengthen the post-war Polish economy, the government created many common-labour faculties across the country, including dairying, fishing, tailoring, chemistry and mechanics to achieve a better economic output alongside efficiency.

After World War II, Poland's borders were redrawn, following the decision taken at the [[Teheran Conference]] of 1943 at the insistence of the Soviet Union. Poland lost 77,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of territory in its eastern regions ([[Kresy]]), gaining instead the smaller but much more industrialized (however ruined) so-called \"[[Regained Territories]]\" [[historical eastern Germany|east of]] the [[Oder-Neisse line]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{main|Voivodeships of Poland}}\nThe Polish People's Republic was divided into several [[voivodeship]]s (the Polish unit of administrative division). After World War II, the new administrative divisions were based on the pre-war ones. The areas in the East that were not [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|annexed by the Soviet Union]] had their borders left almost unchanged. [[Recovered Territories|Newly acquired territories]] in the west and north were organised into the voivodeships of [[Szczecin Voivodeship|Szczecin]], [[Wroc\u0142aw Voivodeship|Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Olsztyn Voivodeship|Olsztyn]] and partially joined to [[Gda\u0144sk Voivodeship|Gda\u0144sk]], [[Katowice Voivodeship|Katowice]] and [[Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship|Pozna\u0144]] voivodeships. Two cities were granted voivodeship status: [[Warsaw]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].\n \nIn 1950, new voivodeships were created: [[Koszalin Voivodeship|Koszalin]] - previously part of [[Szczecin Voivodeship|Szczecin]], [[Opole Voivodeship|Opole]] - previously part of [[Katowice Voivodeship|Katowice]], and [[Zielona G\u00f3ra Voivodeship|Zielona G\u00f3ra]] - previously part of [[Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship|Pozna\u0144]], [[Wroc\u0142aw Voivodeship|Wroc\u0142aw]] and [[Szczecin Voivodeship|Szczecin]] voivodeships. In addition, three other cities were granted the voivodeship status: [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Pozna\u0144]].\n\nIn 1973, Poland voivodeships were changed again. This reorganization of administrative division of Poland was mainly a result of local government reform acts of 1973 to 1975. In place of three level administrative division (voivodeship, county, commune), new two-level administrative division was introduced (49 small voidships and communes). The three smallest voivodeships: [[Warsaw]], [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] had a special status of municipal voivodeship; the city president (mayor) was also province governor.\n\n==See

[[Joseph Stalin]], whose [[Red Army]] occupied the entire country, presented several alternatives which granted Poland [[Recovered territories|industrialized territories]] in the west whilst the Red Army simultaneously permanently annexed Polish [[Kresy|territories in the east]], resulting in Poland losing over 20% of its [[Second Polish Republic|pre-war borders]]. Stalin then imposed upon Poland a Soviet-backed puppet communist government following the war, forcibly bringing the nation into the [[Soviet Empire|Soviet sphere of influence]].]]\n\nAt the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] was able to present his western allies, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]], with a ''[[fait accompli]]'' in Poland. His armed forces were in occupation of the country, and the communists were in control of its administration. The [[Soviet Union]] was in the process of incorporating the lands to the east of the [[Curzon Line]], which it had [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded and occupied between 1939 and 1941]].\n\nIn compensation, the USSR gave Poland former German populated territories in [[Pomerania]], [[Silesia]], and [[Brandenburg]] east of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]], plus the southern half of [[East Prussia]]. These awards were confirmed at the Tripartite Conference of Berlin, otherwise known as the [[Potsdam Conference]] in August 1945 after the end of the war in Europe. Stalin was determined that Poland's new government would become his tool towards making Poland a Soviet puppet state controlled by the communists. He had severed relations with the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London in 1943, but to appease Roosevelt and Churchill he agreed at Yalta that a coalition government would be formed. The communists held a majority of key posts in this new government, and with Soviet support they soon gained almost total control of the country, rigging all elections.\n\nIn June 1946, the \"[[Three Times Yes]]\" referendum was held on a number of issues\u2014abolition of the [[Senate of Poland]], land reform, and making the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] Poland's western border. The communist-controlled Interior Ministry issued results showing that all three questions passed overwhelmingly. Years later, however, evidence was uncovered showing that the referendum had been tainted by massive fraud, and only the third question actually passed.<ref>Czes\u0142aw Os\u0119kowski ''Referendum 30 czerwca 1946 roku w Polsce'', Wydawnictwo Sejmowe, 2000, {{ISBN|83-7059-459-X}}</ref>  [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] then took advantage of a split in the [[Polish Socialist Party]].  One faction, which included [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski]], wanted to join forces with the Peasant Party and form a united front against the Communists. Another faction, led by [[J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz]], argued that the Socialists should support the Communists in carrying through a socialist program, while opposing the imposition of one-party rule. Pre-war political hostilities continued to influence events, and [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] would not agree to form a united front with the Socialists. The Communists played on these divisions by dismissing Os\u00f3bka-Morawski and making Cyrankiewicz Prime Minister.\n\nBetween the referendum and the [[1947 Polish legislative election|January 1947 general elections]], the opposition was subjected to persecution.  Only the candidates of the pro-government \"Democratic Bloc\" (the PPR, Cyrankiewicz' faction of the PPS, and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]]) were allowed to campaign completely unmolested.  Meanwhile, several opposition candidates were prevented from campaigning at all. Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u201349)|Polish People's Party]] (PSL) in particular suffered persecution; it had opposed the abolition of the Senate as a test of strength against the government.  Although it supported the other two questions, the Communist-dominated government branded the PSL \"traitors\".  This massive oppression was overseen by Gomu\u0142ka and the provisional president, [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]].\n\n[[File:Westverschiebung.Polens.gif|thumb|left|Border changes of Poland after [[World War II]]. The eastern territories (''[[Kresy]]'') were annexed by the Soviets. The western so-called \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" were granted as war reparations. Despite the western lands being more industrialized, Poland lost 77,035 km<sup>2</sup> (29,743 sq mi) and major cities like [[Lviv]] and [[Vilnius]].]]\n\nThe official results of the election showed the Democratic Bloc with 80.1 percent of the vote.  The Democratic Bloc was awarded 394 seats to only 28 for the PSL. Miko\u0142ajczyk immediately resigned to protest this so-called 'implausible result', and fled to the United Kingdom in April rather than face arrest.  Later, some historians announced that the official results were only obtained through massive fraud.  Government officials didn't even count the real votes in many areas, and simply filled in the relevant documents in accordance with instructions from the Communists.  In other areas, the ballot boxes were either destroyed or replaced with boxes containing prefilled ballots.\n\nThe 1947 election marked the beginning of undisguised Communist rule in Poland, though it was not officially transformed into the Polish People's Republic until the adoption of the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|1952 Constitution]].  However, Gomu\u0142ka never supported Stalin's control over the Polish Communists, and was soon replaced as party leader by the more pliable Bierut.  In 1948, the Communists consolidated their power, merging with Cyrankiewicz' faction of the PPS to form the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (known in Poland as 'the Party'), which would monopolise political power in Poland until 1989. In 1949, Polish-born Soviet Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] became the Minister of National Defence, with the additional title [[Marshal of Poland]], and in 1952 he became Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers (deputy premier).\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = 3xtak.jpg\n | caption1 = A propaganda poster enhancing to vote for Communist policies in the \"[[Three Times Yes]]\" 1946 referendum\n | image2 = Konstytucja PRL draft with Stalin remarks.jpg\n | caption2 = Draft of [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]] (Russian version) with Stalin's remarks, 1952\n}}\n\nOver the coming years, private industry was [[nationalisation|nationalised]], the land seized from the pre-war landowners and redistributed to the lower-class farmers, and millions of Poles were transferred from the lost eastern territories to the lands acquired from Germany. Poland was now to be brought into line with the Soviet model of a \"people's democracy\" and a centrally planned socialist economy. The government also embarked on the [[collectivisation]] of agriculture, although the pace was slower than in other satellites: Poland remained the only Eastern Bloc country where individual farmers dominated agriculture.\n\nThrough a careful balance of agreement, compromise and resistance \u2014 and having signed an agreement of coexistence with the communist regime \u2014 [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[primate (bishop)|primate]] [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] maintained and even strengthened the Polish church through a series of failed government leaders.

In June, workers in the industrial city of [[Pozna\u0144]] went on strike, in what became known as [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]]. Voices began to be raised in the Party and among the intellectuals calling for wider reforms of the Stalinist system. Eventually, power shifted towards Gomu\u0142ka, who replaced Ochab as party leader. Hardline Stalinists were removed from power and many Soviet officers serving in the [[Polish Army]] were dismissed. This marked the end of the Stalinist era.\n\n=== 1970s and 1980s ===\n[[File:Polish 1970 protests - Zbyszek Godlewski body.jpg|thumb|left|The [[1970 Polish protests]] were ruthlessly crushed by the Communist authorities and [[Milicja Obywatelska|Citizens' Militia]]. The riots resulted in the deaths of 42 people and over 1,000 injured.]]\nIn 1970, Gomu\u0142ka's government had decided to adopt massive increases in the prices of basic goods, including food. The resulting widespread [[Polish 1970 protests|violent protests]] in December that same year resulted in a number of deaths. They also forced another major change in the government, as Gomu\u0142ka was replaced by [[Edward Gierek]] as the new First Secretary. Gierek's plan for recovery was centered on massive borrowing, mainly from the United States and [[West Germany]], to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers some incentive to work. While it boosted the Polish economy, and is still remembered as the \"Golden Age\" of socialist Poland, it left the country vulnerable to global economic fluctuations and western undermining, and the repercussions in the form of massive debt is still felt in Poland even today. This Golden Age came to an end after the [[1973 energy crisis]]. The failure of the Gierek government, both economically and politically, soon led to the creation of opposition in the form of [[trade union]]s, student groups, clandestine newspapers and publishers, imported books and newspapers, and even a \"flying university.\"\n\n[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|250px|Queues waiting to enter state-run grocery stores in Warsaw and other Polish cities and towns were a typical sight in the 1950s and 1980s. The availability of food and goods varied at times, and the most sought after basic item was toilet paper.]]\n\nOn 16 October 1978, the [[Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Karol Wojty\u0142a, was [[Papal conclave, October 1978|elected Pope]], taking the name [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. The election of a Polish Pope had an electrifying effect on what had been, even under Communist rule, one of the most devoutly Catholic nations in Europe. Gierek is alleged to have said to his cabinet, \"O God, what are we going to do now?\" or, as occasionally reported, \"Jesus and Mary, this is the end\". When John Paul II made his first papal tour of Poland in June 1979, half a million people heard him speak in Warsaw; he did not call for rebellion, but instead encouraged the creation of an \"alternative Poland\" of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next economic crisis came, the nation would present a united front.\n\nA new wave of labour strikes undermined Gierek's government, and in September Gierek, who was in poor health, was finally removed from office and replaced as Party leader by [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]]. However, Kania was unable to find an answer for the fast-eroding support of communism in Poland. Labour turmoil led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (''Solidarno\u015b\u0107'') in September 1980, originally led by [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]. In fact, Solidarity became a broad [[anti-communist]] social movement ranging from people associated with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], to members of the anti-Stalinist left. By the end of 1981, Solidarity had nine million members\u2014a quarter of Poland's population and three times as many as the PUWP had. Kania resigned under Soviet pressure in October and was succeeded by [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who had been Defence minister since 1968 and Premier since February.\n\n[[File:Warszawa 1975 WDC 42783.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The new [[Warszawa Centralna railway station]] in [[Warsaw]] had automatic doors and escalators, an unlikely sight in Communist Poland. It was a flagship project during the 1970s economic boom and was dubbed the most modern station in Europe at the time of its completion in 1975.]]\n\nOn 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski [[martial law in Poland|proclaimed martial law]], suspended Solidarity, and temporarily imprisoned most of its leaders. This sudden crackdown on Solidarity was reportedly out of fear of Soviet intervention (see [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980\u201381]]). The government then disallowed Solidarity on 8 October 1982. Martial law was formally lifted in July 1983, though many heightened controls on civil liberties and political life, as well as food rationing, remained in place through the mid-to-late-1980s. Jaruzelski stepped down as prime minister in 1985 and became president (chairman of the Council of State).\n\n[[File:Stakingsleider Lech Walesa deelt handtekeningen uit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] co-founded and headed the [[Solidarno\u015b\u0107|Solidarity movement]] which toppled Communism.

Eventually it eroded the dominance of the PUWP, which in 1981 lost approximately 85,000 of its 3 million members. Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persisted solely as an underground organization, but by the late 1980s was sufficiently strong to frustrate Jaruzelski's attempts at reform, and nationwide [[1988 Polish strikes|strike]]s in 1988 were one of the factors that forced the government to open a dialogue with Solidarity.\n\nFrom 6 February to 15 April 1989, talks of 13 [[working group]]s in 94 sessions, which became known as the \"[[Polish Round Table Agreement|Roundtable Talks]]\" (''Rozmowy Okr\u0105g\u0142ego Sto\u0142u'') saw the PUWP abandon power and radically altered the shape of the country. In June, shortly after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] in China, the [[1989 Polish legislative election]] took place. Much to its own surprise, Solidarity took all contested (35%) seats in the [[Sejm]], the Parliament's lower house, and all but one seat in the fully free elected [[Senate of Poland|Senate]].\n\nSolidarity persuaded the Communists' longtime satellite parties, the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] and Democratic Party, to throw their support to Solidarity.  This all but forced Jaruzelski, who had been named president in July, to appoint a Solidarity member as prime minister.  Finally, he appointed a Solidarity-led coalition government with [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] as the country's first non-Communist prime minister since 1948.\n\nOn 10 December 1989, the [[List of statues of Vladimir Lenin|statue]] of [[Vladimir Lenin]] was removed in [[Warsaw]] by the PRL authorities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Upheaval in the East; Lenin Statue in Mothballs |author=Reuters |date=11 December 1989 |work=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/11/world/upheaval-in-the-east-lenin-statue-in-mothballs.html }}</ref>\n\nThe Parliament amended the Constitution on 29 December 1989 to formally restore democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties. This began the [[Third Polish Republic]], and served as a prelude to the fully democratic elections of [[1991 Polish parliamentary election|1991]]\u2014only the third free election ever held in Poland.\n\nThe PZPR was finally disbanded on 30 January 1990, even if Wa\u0142\u0119sa could be elected as President only eleven months after. The [[Warsaw Pact]] was soon followed on 1 July 1991 and the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991. On 27 October 1991, the [[1991 Polish parliamentary election|first entirely free Polish parliamentary elections]] since the 1920s took place. This completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style [[Parliamentary system|liberal democratic political system]]. The last [[Northern Group of Forces|post-Soviet troops]] left Poland on 18 September 1993. After ten years of [[democratic consolidation]], Poland joined [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] in 1996, [[NATO]] in 1999 and the [[European Union]] in 2004.\n\n== Government and politics ==\n{{see also|Politics of Poland}}\n[[File:POL PZPR logo.svg|thumb|upright=0.60|right|Logo of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]]]]\n\nThe government and politics of the Polish People's Republic were governed by the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (''Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza, PZPR''). Despite the presence of two minor parties, the United People's Party and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]], the country was generally reckoned by western nations as a [[one-party state]] because these two parties were supposedly completely subservient to the Communists and had to accept the PZPR's \"leading role\" as a condition of their existence.  It was dependent on the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] to the extent of being its [[satellite state]]. From 1952, the PRP's highest law was the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]], and the [[Polish Council of State]] replaced the [[president of Poland|presidency of Poland]]. Elections were held on the single lists of the [[Front of National Unity]].\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{see also|Foreign relations of Poland}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0417-0001-011, Berlin, VII.

It also had friendly relations with the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and the [[Western Bloc]] as well as the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\nPRL's [[Israel\u2013Poland relations|relations]] with [[Israel]] were on a fair level following the aftermath of the Holocaust. In 1947, the PRL voted in favour of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], which lead to Israel's recognition by the PRL on 19 May 1948. However, by the [[Six-Day War]], it severed diplomatic relations with Israel in June 1967 and supported the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] which [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|recognized]] the [[State of Palestine]] on 14 December 1988. In 1989, PRL restored relations with Israel.\n\nThe PRL participated as a member of the [[United Nations|UN]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Warsaw Pact]], [[Comecon]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], and [[Interkosmos]].\n\n== Economy ==\n{{further|Economy of Poland|Eastern Bloc economies}}\n\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:Kroscienko PGR 1.jpg|thumb|right|An abandoned [[State Agricultural Farm]] in south-eastern Poland. State farms were a form of [[collective farming]] created in 1949.]]\nPoland suffered tremendous economic losses during World War II. In 1939, Poland had 35.1 million inhabitants, but the census of 14 February 1946 showed only 23.9 million inhabitants. (The difference was partially the result of the border revision.) The losses in national resources and infrastructure amounted to 38%. Compared to [[Western Europe]]an nations, including Germany, Poland was still mostly an agrarian country. The implementation of the immense tasks involved with the reconstruction of the country was intertwined with the struggle of the new government for the stabilisation of power, made even more difficult by the fact that a considerable part of society was mistrustful of the communist government. The occupation of Poland by the Red Army and the support the Soviet Union had shown for the Polish communists was decisive in the communists gaining the upper hand in the new Polish government. Poland was under Soviet control, both directly (Red Army, [[NKVD]], deportations to the SU) and indirectly (NKVD created the Polish political police UB).\n\n[[File:Bazylika Archikatedralna w \u0141odzi.jpg|thumb|left|[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] was Poland's largest city after the destruction of [[Warsaw]] during [[World War II]]. It was also a major industrial centre in Europe and served as the temporary capital due to its economic significance in the 1940s.]]\n\nAs control of the Polish territories passed from occupying forces of [[Nazi Germany]] to the subsequent occupying forces of the [[Soviet Union]], and from the Soviet Union to the Soviet-imposed puppet [[satellite state]], Poland's new [[economic system]] was forcibly imposed and began moving towards a radical, communist [[central planning|centrally planned]] economy. One of the first major steps in that direction involved the [[agricultural reform]] issued by the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] government on 6 September 1944.

Most visibly, work on most of the major investment projects that had begun in the 1970s was stopped. As a result, most Polish cities acquired at least one infamous example of a large unfinished building languishing in a state of limbo. While some of these were eventually finished decades later, most, such as the [[Szkieletor]] [[skyscraper]] in Krak\u00f3w, were never finished at all, wasting the considerable resources devoted to their construction. Polish investment in economic infrastructure and technological development fell rapidly, ensuring that the country lost whatever ground it had gained relative to Western European economies in the 1970s. To escape the constant economic and political pressures during these years, and the general sense of hopelessness, many family income providers traveled for work in Western Europe, particularly West Germany (''Wyjazd na saksy'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/saksy|title=saksy \u2013 Wikis\u0142ownik, wolny s\u0142ownik wieloj\u0119zyczny|website=pl.wiktionary.org|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref> During the era, hundreds of thousands of Poles left the country permanently and settled in the West, few of them returning to Poland even after the end of socialism in Poland.

The government introduced a series of small-scale reforms, such as allowing more small-scale private enterprises to function. However, the government also realized that it lacked the legitimacy to carry out any large-scale reforms, which would inevitably cause large-scale social dislocation and economic difficulties for most of the population, accustomed to the extensive [[social safety net]] that the socialist system had provided. For example, when the government proposed to close the [[Gda\u0144sk Shipyard]], a decision in some ways justifiable from an economic point of view but also largely political, there was a wave of public outrage and the government was forced to back down.\n\nThe only way to carry out such changes without social upheaval would be to acquire at least some support from the opposition side. The government accepted the idea that some kind of a deal with the opposition would be necessary, and repeatedly attempted to find common ground throughout the 1980s. However, at this point the communists generally still believed that they should retain the reins of power for the near future, and only allowed the opposition limited, advisory participation in the running of the country. They believed that this would be essential to pacifying the Soviet Union, which they felt was not yet ready to accept a non-Communist Poland.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{main|Culture in the Polish People's Republic}}\n===Television and media===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width1 = 220\n | width2 = 220\n | image1 = Dziennik telewizyjny.jpg\n | alt1 = Dziennik\n | image2 = Dziennik-telewizyjny-Intro.ogg\n | alt2 = Dziennik\n | footer = Opening panel and sequence of ''[[Dziennik Telewizyjny|Dziennik]]'', the chief news program in communist Poland.

Furthermore, the pre-war system of education was in disarray; many educational facilities were much more accessible in wealthier western and central Poland than in the rural east (Kresy), particularly in the [[Polesie]] region where there was one large school per 100 square kilometers (39 square miles).<ref name=\"auto8\">{{Cite web|url=https://niepodlegla.gov.pl/o-niepodleglej/edukacja-w-ii-rzeczypospolitej/|title=Edukacja w II Rzeczypospolitej|website=Niepodleg\u0142a - stulecie odzyskania niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci}}</ref> Schools were also in desperate need of staff, tutors and teachers before 1939.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> \n\nAfter the [[1947 Polish legislative election]], the communists took full control of the education in the newly-formed Polish People's Republic.

Attendance gradually grew, which put an end to illiteracy in rural areas. The communist government also introduced new beneficial content into the system; sports and [[physical education]] were enforced and students were encouraged to learn foreign languages, especially German, Russian or French and from the 1980s also English. On July 15, 1961, two-year [[vocational education|vocational career training]] was made obligatory to boost the number of skilled labourers and the minimum age of graduation rose to 15. Additionally, special schools were established for deaf, [[muteness|mute]] and blind children. Such institutions for the impaired were almost nonexistent in the Second Polish Republic. During the 1960s, thousands of modern schools were founded. \n\nThe number of universities nearly doubled between 1938 and 1963. Medical, agricultural, economical, engineering and sport faculties became separate colleges, under a universal communist model used in other countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Theological]] faculties were deemed unnecessary or potentially dangerous and were therefore removed from state universities. [[Philosophy]] was also seen as superfluous. In order to strengthen the post-war Polish economy, the government created many common-labour faculties across the country, including dairying, fishing, tailoring, chemistry and mechanics to achieve a better economic output alongside efficiency. However, by 1980 the number of graduates from primary and secondary schools was so high that admission quotas for universities were introduced.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{main|Polish anti-religious campaign (1945\u20131990)}} \n{{see also|Religion in Poland}}\n[[File:Popieluszko Europena 02 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jerzy Popie\u0142uszko]] was a Roman Catholic priest who supported the anti-communist opposition.

After World War II, Poland's borders were redrawn, following the decision taken at the [[Teheran Conference]] of 1943 at the insistence of the Soviet Union. Poland lost 77,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of territory in its eastern regions ([[Kresy]]), gaining instead the smaller but much more industrialized (however ruined) so-called \"[[Regained Territories]]\" [[historical eastern Germany|east of]] the [[Oder-Neisse line]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{main|Voivodeships of Poland}}\nThe Polish People's Republic was divided into several [[voivodeship]]s (the Polish unit of administrative division). After World War II, the new administrative divisions were based on the pre-war ones. The areas in the East that were not [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|annexed by the Soviet Union]] had their borders left almost unchanged. [[Recovered Territories|Newly acquired territories]] in the west and north were organised into the voivodeships of [[Szczecin Voivodeship|Szczecin]], [[Wroc\u0142aw Voivodeship|Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Olsztyn Voivodeship|Olsztyn]] and partially joined to [[Gda\u0144sk Voivodeship|Gda\u0144sk]], [[Katowice Voivodeship|Katowice]] and [[Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship|Pozna\u0144]] voivodeships. Two cities were granted voivodeship status: [[Warsaw]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].\n \nIn 1950, new voivodeships were created: [[Koszalin Voivodeship|Koszalin]] - previously part of [[Szczecin Voivodeship|Szczecin]], [[Opole Voivodeship|Opole]] - previously part of [[Katowice Voivodeship|Katowice]], and [[Zielona G\u00f3ra Voivodeship|Zielona G\u00f3ra]] - previously part of [[Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship|Pozna\u0144]], [[Wroc\u0142aw Voivodeship|Wroc\u0142aw]] and [[Szczecin Voivodeship|Szczecin]] voivodeships. In addition, three other cities were granted the voivodeship status: [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Pozna\u0144]].\n\nIn 1973, Poland voivodeships were changed again. This reorganization of administrative division of Poland was mainly a result of local government reform acts of 1973 to 1975. In place of three level administrative division (voivodeship, county, commune), new two-level administrative division was introduced (49 small voidships and communes). The three smallest voivodeships: [[Warsaw]], [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] had a special status of municipal voivodeship; the city president (mayor) was also province governor.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Poland|Soviet Union|Communism}}\n*[[History of Poland (1945\u20131989)]]\n*[[Soviet Union]]\n\n==References==\n<ref name=\"yivo\">[http://www.yivoinstitute.org/pdf/poland.pdf \"Jews in Poland Since 1939\" (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107111633/http://www.yivoinstitute.org/pdf/poland.pdf |date=7 November 2006 }}, YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, ''The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe'', Yale University Press, 2005</ref>\n<ref name=\"statistical\">[Statistical Yearbook of Poland, Warsaw, 1965]</ref>\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite journal |last= Ekiert |first= Grzegorz |date=March 1997 |title= Rebellious Poles: Political Crises and Popular Protest Under State Socialism, 1945-89 |journal= East European Politics and Societies |volume= 11 |issue= 2 |pages= 299\u2013338 |publisher= American Council of Learned Societies |doi= 10.1177/0888325497011002006}}\n*{{cite book |last= Kuro\u0144 |first= Jacek |authorlink= Jacek Kuro\u0144 |author2=\u017bakowski, Jacek |title = PRL dla pocz\u0105tkuj\u0105cych  |year= 1995 |publisher= Wydawnictwo Dolno\u015bl\u0105skie |location= Wroc\u0142aw |language= Polish |isbn= 83-7023-461-5  |pages= 348 pages}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Polish People's Republic}}\n*[http://www.czas-prl.pl/ PRL] at Czas-PRL.pl {{in lang|pl}}\n*[http://www.polskaludowa.com/ Internetowe Muzeum Polski Ludowej] at PolskaLudowa.com {{in lang|pl}}\n*[http://www.muzeumprl.com/ Muzeum PRL] at MuzeumPRL.com {{in lang|pl}}\n*[http://www.komunizm.eu/index.html Komunizm, socjalizm i czasy PRL-u] at Komunizm.eu {{in lang|pl}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080317093440/http://mirrors.sinuspl.net/www.pk.bezuprzedzen.pl/index.shtml Propaganda komunistyczna] {{in lang|pl}}\n*[http://www.prltube.com/ PRL Tube, a categorized collection of videos from the Polish Communist period] {{in lang|pl}}\n\n{{Poland topics}}\n{{History of the People's Republic of Poland}}\n{{World War II}}\n{{Communist Eastern and Central Europe}}\n{{Eastern Bloc}}\n{{Socialist states}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{coord|52|13|N|21|02|E|source:eswiki_type:country|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Poland, People's Republic Of}}\n[[Category:Polish People's Republic| ]]\n[[Category:Eastern Bloc]]\n[[Category:Former socialist republics]]\n[[Category:Communist states]]\n[[Category:Communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Soviet satellite states]]\n[[Category:Former member states of the United Nations]]\n[[Category:Former polities of the Cold War]]\n[[Category:1947 establishments in Poland]]\n[[Category:1989 disestablishments in Poland]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1947]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1989]]\n", "name_user": "Oliszydlowski", "label": "safe", "comment": "better link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_People%27s_Republic"}

[[Equatorial Guinea]], whose official language is Spanish, experienced an influx of Spanish migrants as it was once a Spanish colony. Some Cuban soldiers who served in the [[Angolan Civil War]] stayed in Angola afterwards. Brazilians have moved to Angola and Mozambique, former Portuguese colonies, and modern officially Portuguese-speaking nations. [[Nigeria]], the home of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Igbo people|Igbo]] cultures, experienced an influx of ex-slaves from Cuba and Brazil  brought there as indentured servants during the 17th century, and again during the 19th century; Equatorial Guinea received Afro-Cuban slaves. In Equatorial Guinea, they became part of the ''[[Emancipados]]''; in Nigeria, they were called ''[[Saro (Nigeria)#Amaros|Amaros]]''.  Despite being free to return to [[Cuba]] and [[Brazil]] when their tenure was over, they remained in these countries marrying into the local native population.\n\n== Latin American diaspora in Northern America ==\nCanada and the United States are popular destinations for Latin American immigrants. The United States is home to 55 million [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]], representing 16% of the US population. Meanwhile, Canada is home to over 300,000 Latino and Hispanic residents.

Latin Americans in Europe are a rapidly growing group consisting of immigrants from [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]].\n\nAs of 2019, around 3 million Latin Americans lived in Europe, mostly in Spain, which has around 2.8 million people residents and/or citizens born in the Americas as of 2019. They represent over 6% of the population of Spain, yet less than 1% of the total population of the [[European Union]]. Portugal also has a sizable Brazilian population.\n\nLatin Americans migrate to the European Union for the following reasons:\n\n*Common language and cultural proximity to Spain and Portugal.\n*Family ties both in Spain and other European countries which grant right to citizenship at origin.\n*Favorable naturalization laws for all Hispanics Americans in Spain, regardless of ancestry.\n* European countries commonly have multicultural societies and there is no feeling of [[Hispanophobia]] as observed in other countries.<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2457295 \"The Hispanophobia of the Official English movement in the US.\" A.C.

Migration of South Americans to Japan was significant after the Second World War. Peruvian, Brazilian, and Bolivian settlers in Japan are largely, but not exclusively of Japanese blood; migration of Brazilian settlers to Japan represented the largest number of [[Portuguese language in Asia|Portuguese speakers in Asia]], greater than those of formerly Portuguese [[East Timor]], [[Macau]] and [[Goa]] combined. Because of common language and cultural proximity, a number of Brazilians settled Macau, others in East Timor and Goa.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Latin countries !!

These Emigrant Policies focus on the rights, obligations and opportunities for participation of emigrated citizens who already live outside the borders of their country of origin. Citizens' rights are the most important policy area, followed by social policies that expand welfare functions beyond state borders. Research on Latin America shows that the extension of policies towards migrants is linked to a focus on civil rights and state benefits that can positively influence integration in recipient countries. Some states actively help their emigrated citizens to integrate into local society. Such policies can reduce the cost of integration for emigrants - and provide untapped potential for cooperation between countries of origin and destination.\nIn addition, the tolerance of dual citizenship has spread more in Latin America than in any other region of the world.<ref>Pedroza, L., Palop, P. & Hoffmann, B.

[[Equatorial Guinea]], whose official language is Spanish, experienced an influx of Spanish migrants as it was once a Spanish colony. Some Cuban soldiers who served in the [[Angolan Civil War]] stayed in Angola afterwards. Brazilians have moved to Angola and Mozambique, former Portuguese colonies, and modern officially Portuguese-speaking nations. [[Nigeria]], the home of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Igbo people|Igbo]] cultures, experienced an influx of ex-slaves from Cuba and Brazil  brought there as indentured servants during the 17th century, and again during the 19th century; Equatorial Guinea received Afro-Cuban slaves. In Equatorial Guinea, they became part of the ''[[Emancipados]]''; in Nigeria, they were called ''[[Saro (Nigeria)#Amaros|Amaros]]''.  Despite being free to return to [[Cuba]] and [[Brazil]] when their tenure was over, they remained in these countries marrying into the local native population.\n\n== Latin American diaspora in Northern America ==\nCanada and the United States are popular destinations for Latin American immigrants. The United States is home to 55 million [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]], representing 16% of the US population. Meanwhile, Canada is home to over 300,000 Latino and Hispanic residents.

They represent over 6% of the population of Spain, yet less than 1% of the total population of the [[European Union]]. Portugal also has a sizable Brazilian population.\n\nLatin Americans migrate to the European Union for the following reasons:\n\n*Common language and cultural proximity to Spain and Portugal.\n*Family ties both in Spain and other European countries which grant right to citizenship at origin.\n*Favorable naturalization laws for all Hispanics Americans in Spain, regardless of ancestry.\n* European countries commonly have multicultural societies and there is no feeling of [[Hispanophobia]] as observed in other countries.<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2457295 \"The Hispanophobia of the Official English movement in the US.\" A.C.

These Emigrant Policies focus on the rights, obligations and opportunities for participation of emigrated citizens who already live outside the borders of their country of origin. Citizens' rights are the most important policy area, followed by social policies that expand welfare functions beyond state borders. Research on Latin America shows that the extension of policies towards migrants is linked to a focus on civil rights and state benefits that can positively influence integration in recipient countries. Some states actively help their emigrated citizens to integrate into local society. Such policies can reduce the cost of integration for emigrants - and provide untapped potential for cooperation between countries of origin and destination.\nIn addition, the tolerance of dual citizenship has spread more in Latin America than in any other region of the world.<ref>Pedroza, L., Palop, P. & Hoffmann, B.
