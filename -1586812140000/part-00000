This marked the only time two previous English champions have met in the final of this competition, and made Wolves the first former champions to have won the trophy, Portsmouth the only other having won the EFL trophy in 2019.\n\nThe competition began on 13 October 1987 and ended with the final on 29 May 1988.\nThe tournament begins with clubs divided into a Northern and a Southern section, and teams entering a preliminary group stage. Each section then gradually eliminates the qualifying teams in knock-out fashion until each has a winning finalist. At this point, the two winning finalists faced each other in the combined final for the honour of the trophy.\n\n== Preliminary round ==\n\n=== Northern Section

Members' Cup]], a knockout competition for [[English football]] clubs in the [[Football League Third Division|Third]] and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth]] Divisions (now known as [[Football League One|League One]] and [[Football League Two|Two]]).\n\nThe winners were [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], who defeated [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] 2\u20130 in the final. This marked the only time two previous English champions have met in the final of this competition, and made Wolves the first former champions to have won the trophy, Portsmouth the only other having won the EFL trophy in 2019.\n\nThe competition began on 13 October 1987 and ended with the final on 29 May 1988.\nThe tournament begins with clubs divided into a Northern and a Southern section, and teams entering a preliminary group stage. Each section then gradually eliminates the qualifying teams in knock-out fashion until each has a winning finalist. At this point, the two winning finalists faced each other in the combined final for the honour of the trophy.\n\n== Preliminary round ==\n\n=== Northern Section ===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{{fb cl

To praise or commemorate any other name during the Salat immediately invalidates the Salat and turns it into an act of shirk. Reciting a corrupt Shahada during Salat: God gave us the correct Shahada (Testimony) in the Quran (3:18).

The corrupt innovation of adding the name of Muhammad to the Shahada is once again, an act of shirk.

His parents were Rodolfo Zedillo Castillo, a mechanic, and Martha Alicia Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Seeking better job and education opportunities for their children, his parents moved to [[Mexicali]], [[Baja California]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1965, at the age of 14, he returned to Mexico City. In 1969 he entered the [[Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional|National Polytechnic Institute]], financing his studies by working in the National Army and Navy Bank (later known as ''Banj\u00e9rcito''). He graduated as an economist in 1972 and began lecturing.

His doctoral thesis was titled ''Mexico's Public External Debt: Recent History and Future Growth Related to Oil''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Political career===\nZedillo began working in the [[Bank of Mexico]] (Mexico's central bank) as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, where he supported the adoption of macroeconomic policies for the country's improvement.\nBy 1987, he was named deputy-secretary of Planning and Budget Control in the Secretariat of Budget and Planning. In 1988, at the age of 36, he headed that secretariat. During his term as Secretary, Zedillo launched a Science and Technology reform.\n\nIn 1992, he was appointed [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Education]] by president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas]].  During his tenure in this post, he was in charge of the revision the Mexican public school textbooks.  The changes, which took a softer line on foreign investment and the Porfiriato, among other topics, were highly controversial and the textbooks were withdrawn.<ref>Gilbert, Dennis. \u201cRewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.\u201d Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, vol. 13, no. 2, 1997, pp. 271\u2013297. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1052017 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> A year later he resigned to run the electoral campaign of [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]'s presidential candidate.\n\n==1994 presidential campaign==\n{{main|1994 Mexican general election}}\n[[File:Vladimir Putin at the Millennium Summit 6-8 September 2000-12.jpg|left|thumb|230px|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Ernesto Zedillo, at the Millennium Summit, 2000]]\n\nIn 1994, after [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]]'s assassination, Zedillo became one of the few [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] members eligible under Mexican law to take his place, since he had not occupied public office for some time.\n\nThe opposition blamed Colosio's murder on Salinas. Although the PRI's presidential candidates were always chosen by the current president, and thus [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] had originally been [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Salinas]]' candidate, their political relationship had been affected by a famous speech during the campaign in which Colosio said that [[Mexico]] had many problems. It is also notable that the assassination took place after Colosio visited the members of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]] in Chiapas and promised to open dialogue, something the PRI opposed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nAfter Colosio's murder, this speech was seen as the main cause of his break with the president.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The choice of Zedillo was interpreted as Salinas' way of bypassing the strong Mexican political tradition of non-reelection and retaining real power, since Zedillo was not really a politician, but an economist (like Salinas), who clearly lacked the president's political talent and influence. It is unclear if Salinas had attempted to control Colosio, who was generally considered at that time to be a far better candidate.\n\nZedillo ran against [[Diego Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos]] of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] and second-timer [[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]] of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]]. He won with 48.69% of popular vote, and became the last president to distinguish the 70-year PRI dynasty in M\u00e9xico during the 20th century.\n\n==Presidency (1994\u20132000)==\n[[File:Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009.jpg|right|thumb|230px| Zedillo at the World Economic Forum 2009]]\n[[File:Edmund S Phelps Ernesto Zedillo.jpg|right|thumb|230 px|Ernesto Zedillo with [[Edmund Phelps]], winner of the 2006 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], at the [[World Economic Forum]]'s Summit on the Global Agenda 2008]]\nAt age 43, Zedillo assumed the presidency on 1 December 1994 at the [[Legislative Palace of San L\u00e1zaro]], taking oath before the [[Congress of the Union]] presided by the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|deputy president]] Carlota Vargas Garza. Zedillo's electoral victory was perceived as clean, but he came to office as an accidental candidate with no political base of his own and no experience. During the first part of his presidency, he took inconsistent policy positions and there were rumors that he would resign or that there would be a coup d'\u00e9tat against him, which caused turmoil in financial markets.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\">Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p.1641</ref>\n\n===Cabinet===\nZedillo's [[Cabinet of Ernesto Zedillo|cabinet]] needed to have members who could deal with crises. Over the course of his presidency, he had four as [[Minister of the Interior]], [[Esteban Moctezuma]], who dealt with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]; [[Emilio Chuayffet]], who resigned following the [[Acteal massacre]]; [[Francisco Labastida]], who won the primary to determine the 2000 PRI presidential candidate; and [[Di\u00f3doro Carrasco Altamirano]], who dealt with the strike at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].\n\n===Financial Crisis of December 1994===\n{{Main|Mexican peso crisis}}\nA few days after taking office, one of the biggest economic crisis in Mexican history hit the country. Although it was outgoing President Salinas who was mainly blamed for the crisis, Salinas claimed that President Zedillo made a mistake by changing the economic policies held by his administration. Zedillo devalued the peso by 15%, which prompted the near-collapse of the financial system.<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\", p. 1641.</ref> [[Mexican peso crisis|The crisis]] ended after a series of reforms and actions led by Zedillo. US president [[Bill Clinton]] granted a US$20&nbsp;billion loan to Mexico, which helped in one of Zedillo's initiatives to rescue the banking system.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | title = Clinton authorizes loan to Mexico | publisher = [[History (U.S. TV channel)]] | date = 31 January 1995 | accessdate = 27 January 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180324010125/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | archive-date = 24 March 2018 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Break with Salinas===\nZedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who was vaulted to prominence with the assassination of Colosio. The conflict between Zedillo and Salinas marked the early part of Zedillo's presidency.<ref>Fuentes, Carlos. \u201cCoalticue's Skirt: Hidden Aspects of Mexico's Political Rivalry in 1995.\u201d The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 2, no. 2, 1995, pp. 175\u2013180. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24590093 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> As with De la Madrid and Salinas, Zedillo had never been elected to office and had no experience in politics. His performance as a candidate was lackluster, but the outbreak of violence in Chiapas and the shock of the Colosio assassination swayed voters to support the PRI candidate in the 1994 election. In office, Zedillo was perceived as a puppet-president with Salinas following the model of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]. In order to consolidate his own power in the presidency, Zedillo had to assert his independence from Salinas. On 28 February 1995 Zedillo ordered the arrest of the ex-president's older brother [[Ra\u00fal Salinas]] for the September 1994 murder of PRI General Secretary [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]]  marked a decisive break between Zedillo and Salinas.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\"/>\n\n===Zapatista Crisis===\n{{Main|1995 Zapatista Crisis}}\nMexico had been in turmoil since January 1994, with the initial Zapatista rebellion and two political assassinations. The presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] was assassinated in March 1994, and his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo replaced him candidate a few days later. The other high-profile assassination, that of PRI Secretary General [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], brother-in-law of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in September 1994, laid bare political rivalries within the PRI. In order to give credibility to the investigations of those political crimes and grant \"a healthy distance\", president Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano Gracia a member of the opposition Political Party [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] as [[Attorney General of Mexico]].  Zedillo inherited the rebellion in Chiapas, but it was up to his administration to handle it.\n\nOn 5 January 1995, the Secretary of Interior [[Esteban Moctezuma]] started a secret meeting process with [[Subcomandante Marcos|Marcos]] called \"Steps Toward Peace\" [[Chiapas]]. Talks seemed promising for an agreement, but Zedillo backed away, apparently because the military was not in accord with the government's apparent \"acceptance of the Zapatistas' control over much of Chiapas territory.\"<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', p. 242.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=330331|title=Zedillo rompi\u00f3 acuerdo de paz con el EZLN: Esteban Moctezuma - Proceso|date=11 January 2013|website=Proceso.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|title=El Universal - Opinion - Renuncia en Gobernaci\u00f3n|website=Eluniversalmas.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802123734/http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|archive-date=2 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In February 1995, the Mexican government identified the masked Subcomandante Marcos as Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n Guill\u00e9n, a former professor at the [[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana]] in Mexico City.

The Mexican economy suffered following the December 1994 peso crisis, when currency was devalued by 15% and the U.S. intervened to prop up the economy with a multi-billion dollar loan, so that NAFTA under the Zedillo administration got off to a rocky start.  The Mexican GDP was -7% and there were hopes that NAFTA would lift that miserable performance statistic.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''.

In July 1996, those talks resulted in the agreement of Mexico's four major parties on a reform package, which was ratified unanimously in legislature.  It created autonomous organizations to oversee elections, made the post of [[List of heads of government of Mexico City|Head of Government of Mexico City]], previously an appointed position, into an elective one, as of July 1997, and created closer oversight of campaign spending. \"Perhaps most crucially, it represents a first step toward consensus among the parties on a set of mutually accepted democratic rules of the game.\"<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1641-42.</ref> The reforms lowered the influence of the PRI and opened opportunities for other parties.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The resurrection of the Mexican left in the 1997 elections: implications for the party system.\" Toward Mexico\u2019s Democratizations: Parties, Campaigns, Elections, and Public Opinion, New York, Routledge (1999).</ref> In the 1997 elections, for the first time the PRI did not win the majority in Congress.

The PRI presidential candidate, [[Francisco Labastida]] was not designated by the sitting president (as all former Presidential nominees from the PRI had been until that point), but by an open internal primary of the party.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The making of the Mexican president, 2000: parties, candidates, and campaign strategy.\" Jorge Dom\u00ednguez and Lawson (2004): 123-56.</ref> Changes in the electoral rules meant that the government did not control voting as it had previously in the Ministry of the Interior.

Also important were some 10,000 Mexican poll watchers and over 850 foreign observers, including ex-president of the U.S., [[Jimmy Carter]]. [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] leader [[Subcomandante Marcos]] declared that the election was a \"dignified and respectable battleground.\"<ref>Fr\u00f6hling, Oliver, Carolyn Gallaher, and John Paul Jones, III. \"Imagining the Mexican election.\" Antipode 33.1 (2001): 2</ref> The results of the election were even more historic.

In Fox's autobiography he writes, \"There are still those old-guard ''priistas'' who consider Ernesto Zedillo a traitor to his class for his actions on the night of July 2, 2000, as the party boss who betrayed the machine.  But in that moment President Zedillo became a true democrat ... In minutes he preempted any possibility of violent resistance from hard-line ''priistas''. It was an act of electoral integrity that will forever mark the mild-mannered economist as a historic figure of Mexico's peaceful transition to democracy.\"<ref>Vicente Fox and Rob Allyn, ''Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith, and Dreams of a Mexican President''.

In 1969 he entered the [[Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional|National Polytechnic Institute]], financing his studies by working in the National Army and Navy Bank (later known as ''Banj\u00e9rcito''). He graduated as an economist in 1972 and began lecturing.

His doctoral thesis was titled ''Mexico's Public External Debt: Recent History and Future Growth Related to Oil''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Political career===\nZedillo began working in the [[Bank of Mexico]] (Mexico's central bank) as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, where he supported the adoption of macroeconomic policies for the country's improvement.\nBy 1987, he was named deputy-secretary of Planning and Budget Control in the Secretariat of Budget and Planning. In 1988, at the age of 36, he headed that secretariat. During his term as Secretary, Zedillo launched a Science and Technology reform.\n\nIn 1992, he was appointed [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Education]] by president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas]].  During his tenure in this post, he was in charge of the revision the Mexican public school textbooks.  The changes, which took a softer line on foreign investment and the Porfiriato, among other topics, were highly controversial and the textbooks were withdrawn.<ref>Gilbert, Dennis. \u201cRewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.\u201d Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, vol. 13, no. 2, 1997, pp. 271\u2013297.

Although the PRI's presidential candidates were always chosen by the current president, and thus [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] had originally been [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Salinas]]' candidate, their political relationship had been affected by a famous speech during the campaign in which Colosio said that [[Mexico]] had many problems. It is also notable that the assassination took place after Colosio visited the members of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]] in Chiapas and promised to open dialogue, something the PRI opposed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nAfter Colosio's murder, this speech was seen as the main cause of his break with the president.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The choice of Zedillo was interpreted as Salinas' way of bypassing the strong Mexican political tradition of non-reelection and retaining real power, since Zedillo was not really a politician, but an economist (like Salinas), who clearly lacked the president's political talent and influence. It is unclear if Salinas had attempted to control Colosio, who was generally considered at that time to be a far better candidate.\n\nZedillo ran against [[Diego Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos]] of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] and second-timer [[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]] of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]]. He won with 48.69% of popular vote, and became the last president to distinguish the 70-year PRI dynasty in M\u00e9xico during the 20th century.\n\n==Presidency (1994\u20132000)==\n[[File:Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009.jpg|right|thumb|230px| Zedillo at the World Economic Forum 2009]]\n[[File:Edmund S Phelps Ernesto Zedillo.jpg|right|thumb|230 px|Ernesto Zedillo with [[Edmund Phelps]], winner of the 2006 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], at the [[World Economic Forum]]'s Summit on the Global Agenda 2008]]\nAt age 43, Zedillo assumed the presidency on 1 December 1994 at the [[Legislative Palace of San L\u00e1zaro]], taking oath before the [[Congress of the Union]] presided by the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|deputy president]] Carlota Vargas Garza. Zedillo's electoral victory was perceived as clean, but he came to office as an accidental candidate with no political base of his own and no experience. During the first part of his presidency, he took inconsistent, zigzagging policy positions and there were rumors that he would resign or that there would be a coup d'\u00e9tat against him, which caused turmoil in financial markets.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\">Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p.1641</ref>\n\n===Cabinet===\nZedillo's [[Cabinet of Ernesto Zedillo|cabinet]] needed to have members who could deal with crises. Over the course of his presidency, he had four as [[Minister of the Interior]], [[Esteban Moctezuma]], who dealt with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]; [[Emilio Chuayffet]], who resigned following the [[Acteal massacre]]; [[Francisco Labastida]], who won the primary to determine the 2000 PRI presidential candidate; and [[Di\u00f3doro Carrasco Altamirano]], who dealt with the strike at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].\n\n===Financial Crisis of December 1994===\n{{Main|Mexican peso crisis}}\nA few days after taking office, one of the biggest economic crisis in Mexican history hit the country. Although it was outgoing President Salinas who was mainly blamed for the crisis, Salinas claimed that President Zedillo made a mistake by changing the economic policies held by his administration. Zedillo devalued the peso by 15%, which prompted the near-collapse of the financial system.<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\", p. 1641.</ref> [[Mexican peso crisis|The crisis]] ended after a series of reforms and actions led by Zedillo. US president [[Bill Clinton]] granted a US$20&nbsp;billion loan to Mexico, which helped in one of Zedillo's initiatives to rescue the banking system.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | title = Clinton authorizes loan to Mexico | publisher = [[History (U.S. TV channel)]] | date = 31 January 1995 | accessdate = 27 January 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180324010125/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/clinton-authorizes-loan-to-mexico | archive-date = 24 March 2018 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Break with Salinas===\nZedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who was vaulted to prominence with the assassination of Colosio. The conflict between Zedillo and Salinas marked the early part of Zedillo's presidency.<ref>Fuentes, Carlos. \u201cCoalticue's Skirt: Hidden Aspects of Mexico's Political Rivalry in 1995.\u201d The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 2, no. 2, 1995, pp. 175\u2013180. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24590093 accessed 23 March 2019</ref> As with De la Madrid and Salinas, Zedillo had never been elected to office and had no experience in politics. His performance as a candidate was lackluster, but the outbreak of violence in Chiapas and the shock of the Colosio assassination swayed voters to support the PRI candidate in the 1994 election. In office, Zedillo was perceived as a puppet-president with Salinas following the model of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]. In order to consolidate his own power in the presidency, Zedillo had to assert his independence from Salinas. On 28 February 1995 Zedillo ordered the arrest of the ex-president's older brother [[Ra\u00fal Salinas]] for the September 1994 murder of PRI General Secretary [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]]  marked a decisive break between Zedillo and Salinas.<ref name=\"Thomas Legler 1997\"/>\n\n===Zapatista Crisis===\n{{Main|1995 Zapatista Crisis}}\nMexico had been in turmoil since January 1994, with the initial Zapatista rebellion and two political assassinations. The presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio|Colosio]] of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] was assassinated in March 1994, and his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo replaced him candidate a few days later. The other high-profile assassination, that of PRI Secretary General [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], brother-in-law of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in September 1994, laid bare political rivalries within the PRI. In order to give credibility to the investigations of those political crimes and grant \"a healthy distance\", president Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano Gracia a member of the opposition Political Party [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] as [[Attorney General of Mexico]].  Zedillo inherited the rebellion in Chiapas, but it was up to his administration to handle it.\n\nOn 5 January 1995, the Secretary of Interior [[Esteban Moctezuma]] started a secret meeting process with [[Subcomandante Marcos|Marcos]] called \"Steps Toward Peace\" [[Chiapas]]. Talks seemed promising for an agreement, but Zedillo backed away, apparently because the military was not in accord with the government's apparent \"acceptance of the Zapatistas' control over much of Chiapas territory.\"<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', p. 242.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=330331|title=Zedillo rompi\u00f3 acuerdo de paz con el EZLN: Esteban Moctezuma - Proceso|date=11 January 2013|website=Proceso.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|title=El Universal - Opinion - Renuncia en Gobernaci\u00f3n|website=Eluniversalmas.com.mx|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802123734/http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2013/01/62462.php|archive-date=2 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In February 1995, the Mexican government identified the masked Subcomandante Marcos as Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n Guill\u00e9n, a former professor at the [[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana]] in Mexico City.

The Mexican economy suffered following the December 1994 peso crisis, when currency was devalued by 15% and the U.S. intervened to prop up the economy with a multi-billion dollar loan, so that NAFTA under the Zedillo administration got off to a rocky start.  The Mexican GDP was -7% and there were hopes that NAFTA would lift that miserable performance statistic.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1026.</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to implementation of NAFTA, Salinas had privatized hundreds of companies. During the Zedillo administration, he privatized [[Rail transport in Mexico#Privatization|the state railway company]], [[:es:Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M\u00e9xico|Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M\u00e9xico]].

It created autonomous organizations to oversee elections, made the post of [[List of heads of government of Mexico City|Head of Government of Mexico City]], previously an appointed position, into an elective one, as of July 1997, and created closer oversight of campaign spending. \"Perhaps most crucially, it represents a first step toward consensus among the parties on a set of mutually accepted democratic rules of the game.\"<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1641-42.</ref> The reforms lowered the influence of the PRI and opened opportunities for other parties.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The resurrection of the Mexican left in the 1997 elections: implications for the party system.\" Toward Mexico\u2019s Democratizations: Parties, Campaigns, Elections, and Public Opinion, New York, Routledge (1999).</ref> In the 1997 elections, for the first time the PRI did not win the majority in Congress.

The PRI presidential candidate, [[Francisco Labastida]] was not designated by the sitting president (as all former Presidential nominees from the PRI had been until that point), but by an open internal primary of the party.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"The making of the Mexican president, 2000: parties, candidates, and campaign strategy.\" Jorge Dom\u00ednguez and Lawson (2004): 123-56.</ref> Changes in the electoral rules meant that the government did not control voting as it had previously in the Ministry of the Interior. Elections were now  the jurisdiction of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), with Mexicans having faith that elections would be free and fair.<ref>Wallis, Darren. \"The Mexican Presidential and Congressional Elections of 2000 and Democratic Transition.\" Bulletin of Latin American Research 20.3 (2001): 304-323.</ref> IFE implemented new  procedures regarding campaigns and balloting, with rules for finance, guarantee of the secret ballot, and unbiased counting of votes. Also important were some 10,000 Mexican poll watchers and over 850 foreign observers, including ex-president of the U.S., [[Jimmy Carter]]. [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] leader [[Subcomandante Marcos]] declared that the election was a \"dignified and respectable battleground.\"<ref>Fr\u00f6hling, Oliver, Carolyn Gallaher, and John Paul Jones, III. \"Imagining the Mexican election.\" Antipode 33.1 (2001): 2</ref> The results of the election were even more historic.

In Fox's autobiography he writes, \"There are still those old-guard ''priistas'' who consider Ernesto Zedillo a traitor to his class for his actions on the night of July 2, 2000, as the party boss who betrayed the machine.  But in that moment President Zedillo became a true democrat ... In minutes he preempted any possibility of violent resistance from hard-line ''priistas''. It was an act of electoral integrity that will forever mark the mild-mannered economist as a historic figure of Mexico's peaceful transition to democracy.\"<ref>Vicente Fox and Rob Allyn, ''Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith, and Dreams of a Mexican President''.

The Bowie knife is not well defined. By the mid-20th century most would include some combination of blade length and blade shape. In the mid-19th century, when the popularity of the knife was at its peak, the term was applied to a wide range of blades.<ref>{{cite book | last = Peterson | first = Howard L. | title = American Knives; The First History and Collector's Guide | publisher = Gun Room Press | location = Highland Park, N. J. | year = 1958 | page = 26}} Four definitions of \"Bowie\" knives had supporters (in the mid-20th century). All agree that they are sheath knives (basically short swords with a handle and a blade optionally separated by a guard). Some require a blade length; some require a clipped blade; some require both; some require neither for knives produced between 1830 and 1890.</ref>  Absent a consensus definition, it is impossible to clearly define the origin of the knife. To complicate matters, some American blades that meet the modern definition of the Bowie knife may pre-date Bowie.<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | page = 345}} \"Nor was the \"clip point\" unknown in America, pre-Jim Bowie.\"  (Accompanied by examples and references.)</ref>\n\nThe Bowie knife derives part of its name and reputation from [[James Bowie]], a notorious [[knife fight]]er, who died at the Alamo. James Bowie left a very thin paper trail; in the absence of verifiable facts, his history was buried in unverifiable knife-fighting legend. Historians seriously entertain the possibility that Bowie only fought one personal knife fight<ref>{{cite book | last = Davis | first = William C. | authorlink= William C.

That [[Sandbar Fight]] received national publicity (accounts in Philadelphia, New York, and the ''Niles' Register'' of Washington, D.C.) within months of the event. James Bowie prominently wore a large knife after the Sandbar fight.\n\nThe Bowie family provided a variety of conflicting knife histories. James Bowie left nothing. His brother [[Rezin Bowie]] provided a terse history two years after James' death. Sixteen years after James' death someone (assumed to be James' brother John) slightly amended Rezin's explanation to include a blacksmith. Rezin's grandchildren named a different blacksmith. A later Bowie claimed that the information attributed to John was a lie and that John probably never saw the document, etc.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J.

The back of the blade sometimes had a strip of soft metal (normally [[brass]] or [[copper]]) inlaid which some believe was intended to catch an opponent's blade while others hold it was intended to provide support and absorb shock to help prevent breaking of poor quality steel or poorly heat treated blades. (A brass back is an indication of modern construction.<ref>{{cite book| last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | pages = 464\u2013466}}  \"[N]o authenticated brass back Bowie has yet to be accepted in all quarters as genuine{{nbsp}}...\".</ref>)  Bowie knives often had an upper guard that bent forward at an angle (an [[S-guard]]) intended to catch an opponent's blade or provide protection to the owner's hand during parries and corps-a-corps.\n\nSome Bowie knives had a notch on the bottom of the blade near the [[hilt]] known as a \"Spanish Notch\". The Spanish Notch is often cited as a mechanism for catching an opponent's blade; however, some Bowie researchers hold that the Spanish Notch is ill-suited to this function and frequently fails to achieve the desired results. These researchers, instead, hold that the Spanish Notch has the much more mundane function as a tool for stripping [[sinew]] and repairing [[rope]] and nets, as a guide to assist in sharpening the blade (assuring that the sharpening process starts at a specific point and not further up the edge), or as a point to relieve stress on the blade during use.\n\nOne characteristic of Bowie knives is the [[clip point]] at the top of the blade, which brings the tip of the blade lower than the spine and in line with the handle for better control during thrusting attacks. As the goal is to produce a sharp, stabbing point, most Bowie knives have a bevel ground along the clip, typically 1/4 of the way, but sometimes much further running the entire top-edge. This is referred to as a false [[edge]] as from a distance it looks sharpened, although it may or may not be. Regardless of whether or not the false edge is sharp, it serves to take metal away from the point, streamlining the tip and thus enhancing the penetration capability of the blade during a stab. The version attributed to blacksmith James Black had this false edge fully sharpened in order to allow someone trained in European techniques of [[Sabre (fencing)|saber fencing]] to execute the maneuver called the \"back cut\" or \"back slash\"..<ref name=\"MC\"/>  A brass [[quillon]], usually cast in a mold, was attached to protect the hand.\n\nThe Bowie knife's design also lends itself to use as a hunting knife for skinning or butchering game. The curved top clip bevel of the blade, when suitably sharpened, may be used to remove the skin from a [[Cadaver|carcass]], while the straight portion of the blade edge, toward the guard, can be used for cutting meat. Arkansas culturalist and researcher Russell T. Johnson describes the [[James Black]] knife in the following manner and at the same time captures the quintessence of the Bowie Knife: \"It must be long enough to use as a sword, sharp enough to use as a razor, wide enough to use as a paddle, and heavy enough to use as a hatchet.\"<ref name=\"MC\"/><ref name=\"RJ\"/>  Most such knives intended for hunting are only sharpened on one edge, to reduce the danger of cutting oneself while butchering and [[skinning]] the carcass.\n\n== History ==\n=== The Vidalia Sandbar Fight ===\n[[File:Coffin handle bowie knife.jpg|thumb|right|A coffin-handled Bowie knife]]\n{{Main|Sandbar Fight}}\n\nThe first knife, with which Bowie became famous, allegedly was designed by Jim Bowie's brother Rezin in [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana]] and smithed by blacksmith Jesse Clifft out of an old file.<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Period court documents indicate that [[Rezin Bowie]] and Clifft were well acquainted with one another. Rezin's granddaughter claimed in an 1885 letter to [[Louisiana State University]] that she personally witnessed Clifft make the knife for her grandfather.\n\nThis knife became famous as the knife used by Bowie at the [[Sandbar Fight]], a famous 1827 [[duel]] between Bowie and several men including a Major Norris Wright of [[Alexandria, Louisiana]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  The fight took place on a [[sandbar]] in the [[Mississippi River]] across from [[Natchez, Mississippi]], and is the only documented fight in which Bowie was known to have employed his Bowie knife design. In this battle Bowie was stabbed, shot, and beaten half to death but managed to win the fight using the large knife.<ref name =\"MC\"/>\n\nJim Bowie's older brother John would later claim that the knife at the Sandbar Fight was not Clifft's knife, but a knife specifically made for Bowie by a blacksmith named Snowden.<ref name=\"Shackleford2010\">{{cite book|last=Shackleford|first=Steve |title=Blade's Guide to Knives & Their Values|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6NZd17WtWoC&pg=PA307|accessdate=27 January 2012|year=2010|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-0387-9|page=307}}</ref>\n\n=== James Black's Bowie knife ===\nThe most famous version of the Bowie knife was designed by Jim Bowie and presented to [[Arkansas]] [[blacksmith]] [[James Black (blacksmith)|James Black]] in the form of a carved wooden model in December 1830.<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Black produced the knife ordered by Bowie, and at the same time created another based on Bowie's original design but with a sharpened edge on the curved top edge of the blade.

Black continued to refine his technique and improve the quality of the knife as he went. In 1839, shortly after his wife's death, Black was nearly blinded when, while he was in bed with illness, his father-in-law and former partner broke into his home and attacked him with a club, having objected to his daughter having married Black years earlier. Black was no longer able to continue in his trade.\n\nBlack's knives were known to be exceedingly tough, yet flexible, and his technique has not been duplicated. Black kept his technique secret and did all of his work behind a leather curtain. Many claim that Black rediscovered the secret of producing true [[Damascus steel]].<ref name=\"RJ\"/>\n\nIn 1870, at the age of 70, Black attempted to pass on his secret to the son of the family that had cared for him in his old age, [[Daniel Webster Jones (governor)|Daniel Webster Jones]]. However, Black had been retired for many years and found that he himself had forgotten the secret. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas.\n\nThe birthplace of the Bowie knife is now part of the [[Old Washington Historic State Park]] which has over 40 restored historical buildings and other facilities including Black's shop. The park is known as \"The [[Colonial Williamsburg]] of Arkansas\". The [[American Bladesmith Society]] established the [[William F.

From context, \"Bowie knife\" needed no description then, but the spelling was variable. Among the first mentions was a plan to combine a Bowie knife and pistol. Cutlers were shipping sheath knives from Sheffield England by the early 1830s. By 1838 a writer in a Baltimore newspaper (posted from New Orleans) suggested that every reader had seen a Bowie knife.<ref name=\"Flayderman 2004\"/>\n\nThe Bowie knife found its greatest popularity in the [[Old Southwest]] of the mid-19th century. However, accounts of Bowie knife fighting schools are based on fiction; newspapers of the era in the region contained advertisements for classes in fencing and self-defense.<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-931464-12-3 | pages = 312 }}  Chapter 11: \"Bowie Knife Duels, Rules, Manuals ... and Schools - Dueling in American Folkways and Folklore\"  \"... &nbsp;the evidence for \"knife schools in all the major cities\" fails to support or corroborate their presence.\"  [[Charles Dickens]]' fictional [[Great Expectations]] was quoted as proof of the existence of knife fighting schools.</ref>\n\nBowie knives had a role in the American conflicts of the nineteenth century. They are historically mentioned in the independence of Texas, in the Mexican War, the California gold rush, the [[Bleeding Kansas|civil strife in Kansas]], the Civil War and later conflicts with the American Indians.  [[John Brown (abolitionist)]] carried a Bowie (which was taken by [[J. E. B. Stuart]]). (p 117)  [[John Wilkes Booth]] (assassin of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) dropped a large Bowie knife as he escaped. (p 158)  \"[[Buffalo Bill]]\" Cody ''reportedly'' scalped a sub-chief in 1876 in revenge for Custer (the [[Battle of Warbonnet Creek]]). An illustration of the reputed event showed a Bowie knife. (p 171)<ref name=\"Flayderman 2004\"/>\n\nThe popularity of the Bowie knife declined late in the nineteenth century. Large-caliber and reliable [[revolver]]s were available by the mid-1870s, reducing a knife advantage. Prior to the Civil War most handguns were single- or double-barrel muzzle-loaders, and the [[percussion cap]] was considered a great leap forward in reliability even then; multiple shot [[pepperbox]]es and crude revolvers were available, but often in small caliber, highly unreliable, and expensive. The Civil War popularized six-shot [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] and [[Smith & Wesson]]-type revolvers which contained a sufficient number of lethal shot to make it possible to carry the firearm alone, without a major backup weapon, unlike earlier pistols which left the user defenseless once they had been fired. The frontier rapidly vanished, reducing the number of hunters and trappers. Large knives had limited utility, so Bowies shrunk.\n\nThe [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Ka-Bar]] of [[World War II]] fame is based on the Bowie design.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Walker  | first = Greg  | title = KA-BAR: The Next Generation of the Ultimate Fighting Knife  | place = Boulder, Colorado  | publisher = Paladin Press   | year = 2001  | isbn = 1-58160-120-4}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, Bowie knives with sawteeth machined into the back side of the blade appeared inspired by the [[Aircrew Survival Egress Knife|United States Air Force survival knife]] (NSN 7340-00-098-4327). The sawteeth were intended to cut through the [[acrylic glass]] canopy of a downed aircraft. During the [[Vietnam War]] the [[United States Army]] issued them to [[helicopter]] crews for the same purpose.\n\nOn July 27, 1969, [[Manson Family|Manson associate]] [[Bobby Beausoleil]] murdered Gary Hinman by stabbing him with a Bowie knife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/photo-archive/beausoleil-hinman-murder-knife-01.php|title=Bobby Beausoleil's Bowie Knife and Buckskin Sheath - Charles Manson Family and Sharon Tate-Labianca Murders - Cielodrive.com|author=|date=|website=www.cielodrive.com|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Variations, collecting and portrayal in popular culture ==\nJim Bowie was posthumously inducted into the [[Blade (magazine)|Blade Magazine]] Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 Blade Show in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in recognition for the impact that his design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies.\n\n[[File:Krag Bowie Bayonet.JPG|thumb|Krag Bowie bayonet US stamped, on the reverse date 1900]]\n\nCustom knife maker [[Ernest Emerson]] originally used a Bowie knife in his logo and manufactures a folding Bowie known in his line-up as the CQC13.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Norman | first=Chris| title=Ernest Emerson | journal=Knives Illustrated |volume=10 |issue=4| year=1995 | pages=104\u2013108 }}</ref>\n\nA Bowie knife appears on the shoulder sleeve insignia of the [[39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]], headquartered in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].\n\n===Variations===\nAmong the many variations on Bowie knives (discussed or shown by Flayderman or Peterson) are Bowies with interchangeable blades, push daggers, double-ended Bowies, folding Bowies, Bowies with a cork screw or other accessories, Bowie bayonets, combination Bowie/pistols, a Bowie with a saw-toothed back and Confederate Bowies with D-guards.

A few huge Bowies up to {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} long were created for exhibition.\n\nOver the years many knives have been called Bowie knives and the term has almost become a generic term for any large sheath knife. During the early days of the [[American Civil War]] [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers carried immense knives called [[D-Guard Bowie knives]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Many of these knives could have qualified as short [[sword]]s and were often made from old saw or [[scythe]] blades.\n\nThe Bowie knife is sometimes confused with the \"[[Arkansas toothpick]],\" possibly due to the interchangeable use of the names \"Arkansas toothpick\", \"Bowie knife\", and \"Arkansas knife\" in the antebellum period.<ref name=ark/>  The Arkansas toothpick is essentially a heavy [[dagger]] with a straight {{convert|15|-|25|in|cm}} blade.

The term itself defied definition in those days as it does today, but a rough description would be a large sheath knife, usually with a small cross guard and a clipped point, whose story began in the American Southwest about 1830.\"</ref> The knife pattern is still popular with collectors; in addition to various knife manufacturing companies there are hundreds of custom knife makers producing Bowies and variations.\n\n==Historical complications==\nThe early history of the Bowie knife is complicated by murky definitions, limited supporting documentation, and conflicting claims. The Bowie knife is not well defined. By the mid-20th century most would include some combination of blade length and blade shape. In the mid-19th century, when the popularity of the knife was at its peak, the term was applied to a wide range of blades.<ref>{{cite book | last = Peterson | first = Howard L. | title = American Knives; The First History and Collector's Guide | publisher = Gun Room Press | location = Highland Park, N. J. | year = 1958 | page = 26}} Four definitions of \"Bowie\" knives had supporters (in the mid-20th century). All agree that they are sheath knives (basically short swords with a handle and a blade optionally separated by a guard). Some require a blade length; some require a clipped blade; some require both; some require neither for knives produced between 1830 and 1890.</ref>  Absent a consensus definition, it is impossible to clearly define the origin of the knife. To complicate matters, some American blades that meet the modern definition of the Bowie knife may pre-date Bowie.<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | page = 345}} \"Nor was the \"clip point\" unknown in America, pre-Jim Bowie.\"  (Accompanied by examples and references.)</ref>\n\nThe Bowie knife derives part of its name and reputation from [[James Bowie]], a notorious [[knife fight]]er, who died at the Alamo. James Bowie left a very thin paper trail; in the absence of verifiable facts, his history was buried in unverifiable knife-fighting legend. Historians seriously entertain the possibility that Bowie only fought one personal knife fight<ref>{{cite book | last = Davis | first = William C. | authorlink= William C.

That [[Sandbar Fight]] received national publicity (accounts in Philadelphia, New York, and the ''Niles' Register'' of Washington, D.C.) within months of the event. James Bowie prominently wore a large knife after the Sandbar fight.\n\nThe Bowie family provided a variety of conflicting knife histories. James Bowie left nothing. His brother [[Rezin Bowie]] provided a terse history two years after James' death. Sixteen years after James' death someone (assumed to be James' brother John) slightly amended Rezin's explanation to include a blacksmith. Rezin's grandchildren named a different blacksmith. A later Bowie claimed that the information attributed to John was a lie and that John probably never saw the document, etc.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J.

The back of the blade sometimes had a strip of soft metal (normally [[brass]] or [[copper]]) inlaid which some believe was intended to catch an opponent's blade while others hold it was intended to provide support and absorb shock to help prevent breaking of poor quality steel or poorly heat treated blades. (A brass back is an indication of modern construction.<ref>{{cite book| last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | pages = 464\u2013466}}  \"[N]o authenticated brass back Bowie has yet to be accepted in all quarters as genuine{{nbsp}}...\".</ref>)  Bowie knives often had an upper guard that bent forward at an angle (an [[S-guard]]) intended to catch an opponent's blade or provide protection to the owner's hand during parries and corps-a-corps.\n\nSome Bowie knives had a notch on the bottom of the blade near the [[hilt]] known as a \"Spanish Notch\". The Spanish Notch is often cited as a mechanism for catching an opponent's blade; however, some Bowie researchers hold that the Spanish Notch is ill-suited to this function and frequently fails to achieve the desired results. These researchers, instead, hold that the Spanish Notch has the much more mundane function as a tool for stripping [[sinew]] and repairing [[rope]] and nets, as a guide to assist in sharpening the blade (assuring that the sharpening process starts at a specific point and not further up the edge), or as a point to relieve stress on the blade during use.\n\nOne characteristic of Bowie knives is the [[clip point]] at the top of the blade, which brings the tip of the blade lower than the spine and in line with the handle for better control during thrusting attacks. As the goal is to produce a sharp, stabbing point, most Bowie knives have a bevel ground along the clip, typically 1/4 of the way, but sometimes much further running the entire top-edge. This is referred to as a [[false edge]] as from a distance it looks sharpened, although it may or may not be. Regardless of whether or not the false edge is sharp, it serves to take metal away from the point, streamlining the tip and thus enhancing the penetration capability of the blade during a stab. The version attributed to blacksmith James Black had this false edge fully sharpened in order to allow someone trained in European techniques of [[Sabre (fencing)|saber fencing]] to execute the maneuver called the \"back cut\" or \"back slash\"..<ref name=\"MC\"/>  A brass [[quillon]], usually cast in a mold, was attached to protect the hand.\n\nThe Bowie knife's design also lends itself to use as a hunting knife for skinning or butchering game. The curved top clip bevel of the blade, when suitably sharpened, may be used to remove the skin from a [[Cadaver|carcass]], while the straight portion of the blade edge, toward the guard, can be used for cutting meat. Arkansas culturalist and researcher Russell T. Johnson describes the [[James Black knife]] in the following manner and at the same time captures the quintessence of the Bowie Knife: \"It must be long enough to use as a sword, sharp enough to use as a razor, wide enough to use as a paddle, and heavy enough to use as a hatchet.\"<ref name=\"MC\"/><ref name=\"RJ\"/>  Most such knives intended for hunting are only sharpened on one edge, to reduce the danger of cutting oneself while butchering and [[skinning]] the carcass.\n\n== History ==\n=== The Vidalia Sandbar Fight ===\n[[File:Coffin handle bowie knife.jpg|thumb|right|A coffin-handled Bowie knife]]\n{{Main|Sandbar Fight}}\n\nThe first knife, with which Bowie became famous, allegedly was designed by Jim Bowie's brother Rezin in [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana]] and smithed by blacksmith Jesse Clifft out of an old file.<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Period court documents indicate that [[Rezin Bowie]] and Clifft were well acquainted with one another. Rezin's granddaughter claimed in an 1885 letter to [[Louisiana State University]] that she personally witnessed Clifft make the knife for her grandfather.\n\nThis knife became famous as the knife used by Bowie at the [[Sandbar Fight]], a famous 1827 [[duel]] between Bowie and several men including a Major Norris Wright of [[Alexandria, Louisiana]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  The fight took place on a [[sandbar]] in the [[Mississippi River]] across from [[Natchez, Mississippi]], and is the only documented fight in which Bowie was known to have employed his Bowie knife design.

Black continued to refine his technique and improve the quality of the knife as he went. In 1839, shortly after his wife's death, Black was nearly blinded when, while he was in bed with illness, his father-in-law and former partner broke into his home and attacked him with a club, having objected to his daughter having married Black years earlier. Black was no longer able to continue in his trade.\n\nBlack's knives were known to be exceedingly tough, yet flexible, and his technique has not been duplicated. Black kept his technique secret and did all of his work behind a leather curtain. Many claim that Black rediscovered the secret of producing true [[Damascus steel]].<ref name=\"RJ\"/>\n\nIn 1870, at the age of 70, Black attempted to pass on his secret to the son of the family that had cared for him in his old age, [[Daniel Webster Jones (governor)|Daniel Webster Jones]]. However, Black had been retired for many years and found that he himself had forgotten the secret. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas.\n\nThe birthplace of the Bowie knife is now part of the [[Old Washington Historic State Park]] which has over 40 restored historical buildings and other facilities including Black's shop. The park is known as \"The [[Colonial Williamsburg]] of Arkansas\". The [[American Bladesmith Society]] established the [[William F.

From context, \"Bowie knife\" needed no description then, but the spelling was variable. Among the first mentions was a plan to combine a Bowie knife and pistol. Cutlers were shipping sheath knives from Sheffield England by the early 1830s. By 1838 a writer in a Baltimore newspaper (posted from New Orleans) suggested that every reader had seen a Bowie knife.<ref name=\"Flayderman 2004\"/>\n\nThe Bowie knife found its greatest popularity in the [[Old Southwest]] of the mid-19th century. However, accounts of Bowie knife fighting schools are based on fiction; newspapers of the era in the region contained advertisements for classes in fencing and self-defense.<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-931464-12-3 | pages = 312 }}  Chapter 11: \"Bowie Knife Duels, Rules, Manuals ... and Schools - Dueling in American Folkways and Folklore\"  \"... &nbsp;the evidence for \"knife schools in all the major cities\" fails to support or corroborate their presence.\"  [[Charles Dickens]]' fictional [[Great Expectations]] was quoted as proof of the existence of knife fighting schools.</ref>\n\nBowie knives had a role in the American conflicts of the nineteenth century. They are historically mentioned in the independence of Texas, in the Mexican War, the California gold rush, the [[Bleeding Kansas|civil strife in Kansas]], the Civil War and later conflicts with the American Indians.  [[John Brown (abolitionist)]] carried a Bowie (which was taken by [[J. E. B. Stuart]]). (p 117)  [[John Wilkes Booth]] (assassin of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) dropped a large Bowie knife as he escaped. (p 158)  \"[[Buffalo Bill]]\" Cody ''reportedly'' scalped a sub-chief in 1876 in revenge for Custer (the [[Battle of Warbonnet Creek]]). An illustration of the reputed event showed a Bowie knife. (p 171)<ref name=\"Flayderman 2004\"/>\n\nThe popularity of the Bowie knife declined late in the nineteenth century. Large-caliber and reliable [[revolver]]s were available by the mid-1870s, reducing a knife advantage. Prior to the Civil War most handguns were single- or double-barrel muzzle-loaders, and the [[percussion cap]] was considered a great leap forward in reliability even then; multiple shot [[pepperbox]]es and crude revolvers were available, but often in small caliber, highly unreliable, and expensive. The Civil War popularized six-shot [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] and [[Smith & Wesson]]-type revolvers which contained a sufficient number of lethal shot to make it possible to carry the firearm alone, without a major backup weapon, unlike earlier pistols which left the user defenseless once they had been fired. The frontier rapidly vanished, reducing the number of hunters and trappers. Large knives had limited utility, so Bowies shrunk.\n\nThe [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Ka-Bar]] of [[World War II]] fame is based on the Bowie design.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Walker  | first = Greg  | title = KA-BAR: The Next Generation of the Ultimate Fighting Knife  | place = Boulder, Colorado  | publisher = Paladin Press   | year = 2001  | isbn = 1-58160-120-4}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, Bowie knives with sawteeth machined into the back side of the blade appeared inspired by the [[Aircrew Survival Egress Knife|United States Air Force survival knife]] (NSN 7340-00-098-4327). The sawteeth were intended to cut through the [[acrylic glass]] canopy of a downed aircraft. During the [[Vietnam War]] the [[United States Army]] issued them to [[helicopter]] crews for the same purpose.\n\nOn July 27, 1969, [[Manson Family|Manson associate]] [[Bobby Beausoleil]] murdered Gary Hinman by stabbing him with a Bowie knife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/photo-archive/beausoleil-hinman-murder-knife-01.php|title=Bobby Beausoleil's Bowie Knife and Buckskin Sheath - Charles Manson Family and Sharon Tate-Labianca Murders - Cielodrive.com|author=|date=|website=www.cielodrive.com|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Variations, collecting and portrayal in popular culture ==\nJim Bowie was posthumously inducted into the [[Blade (magazine)|Blade Magazine]] Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 Blade Show in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in recognition for the impact that his design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies.\n\n[[File:Krag Bowie Bayonet.JPG|thumb|Krag Bowie bayonet US stamped, on the reverse date 1900]]\n\nCustom knife maker [[Ernest Emerson]] originally used a Bowie knife in his logo and manufactures a folding Bowie known in his line-up as the CQC13.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Norman | first=Chris| title=Ernest Emerson | journal=Knives Illustrated |volume=10 |issue=4| year=1995 | pages=104\u2013108 }}</ref>\n\nA Bowie knife appears on the shoulder sleeve insignia of the [[39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]], headquartered in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].\n\n===Variations===\nAmong the many variations on Bowie knives (discussed or shown by Flayderman or Peterson) are Bowies with interchangeable blades, push daggers, double-ended Bowies, folding Bowies, Bowies with a cork screw or other accessories, Bowie bayonets, combination Bowie/pistols, a Bowie with a saw-toothed back and Confederate Bowies with D-guards.

A few huge Bowies up to {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} long were created for exhibition.\n\nOver the years many knives have been called Bowie knives and the term has almost become a generic term for any large sheath knife. During the early days of the [[American Civil War]] [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers carried immense knives called [[D-Guard Bowie knives]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Many of these knives could have qualified as short [[sword]]s and were often made from old saw or [[scythe]] blades.\n\nThe Bowie knife is sometimes confused with the \"[[Arkansas toothpick]],\" possibly due to the interchangeable use of the names \"Arkansas toothpick\", \"Bowie knife\", and \"Arkansas knife\" in the antebellum period.<ref name=ark/>  The Arkansas toothpick is essentially a heavy [[dagger]] with a straight {{convert|15|-|25|in|cm}} blade.
