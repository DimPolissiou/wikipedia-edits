LOFAR is also a technology precursor for the [[Square Kilometre Array]].\n\n== Technical information ==\n[[File:A low-band antenna of LOFAR.jpg|thumb|Low-band antenna with electronics cabin in the background]]\nLOFAR was conceived as an innovative effort to force a breakthrough in sensitivity for astronomical observations at radio-frequencies below 250&nbsp;MHz. Astronomical radio interferometers usually consist either of arrays of [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic dishes]] (e.g. the [[One-Mile Telescope]] or the [[Very Large Array]]), arrays of one-dimensional antennas (e.g. the [[Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope]]) or two-dimensional arrays of [[omnidirectional antenna]]s (e.g. [[Antony Hewish]]'s [[Interplanetary Scintillation Array]]).\n\nLOFAR combines aspects of many of these earlier telescopes; in particular, it uses omnidirectional dipole antennas as elements of a [[phased array]] at individual stations, and combines those phased arrays using the [[aperture synthesis]] technique developed in the 1950s. Like the earlier [[Cambridge Low Frequency Synthesis Telescope]] (CLFST) low-frequency radio telescope, the design of LOFAR has concentrated on the use of large numbers of relatively cheap antennas without any moving parts, concentrated in stations, with the mapping performed using aperture synthesis [[software]]. The direction of observation (\"beam\") of the stations is chosen electronically by phase delays between the antennas. LOFAR can observe in several directions simultaneously, as long as their aggregated data rate remains under its cap. This in principle allows a multi-user operation.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLOFAR makes observations in the 10&nbsp;MHz to 240&nbsp;MHz frequency range with two types of antennas: Low Band Antenna (LBA) and High Band Antenna (HBA), optimized for 10-80&nbsp;MHz and 120-240&nbsp;MHz respectively.<ref name=lofar-antennae-description>{{cite web | url=https://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/technical-information/antennae/antennae-description | title=Antenna Description| publisher=ASTRON|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref>{{primary inline|date=August 2019}} The electric signals from the LOFAR stations are digitised, transported to a central digital processor, and combined in software in order to map the sky.  Therefore, LOFAR is a \"software telescope\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.es.ele.tue.nl/gpu/downloads/handouts13.pdf| title=Many-Core Processing for the LOFAR Software Telescope}}</ref> The cost is dominated by the cost of electronics and will therefore mostly follow [[Moore's law]], becoming cheaper with time and allowing increasingly large telescopes to be built. The antennas are simple enough,{{clarify|date=August 2019}} but there are about 20,000 in the LOFAR array.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===LOFAR stations===\nTo make radio surveys of the sky with adequate resolution, the antennas are arranged in clusters that are spread out over an area of more than 1000&nbsp;km in diameter. The LOFAR stations in the Netherlands reach baselines of about 100&nbsp;km. LOFAR currently receives data from 24 core stations (in [[Exloo]]), 14 'remote' stations in The Netherlands and 12 international stations. Each of the core and remote stations has 48 HBAs and 96 LBAs and a total of 48 digital Receiver Units (RCUs). International stations have 96 LBAs and 96 HBAs and a total of 96 digital Receiver Units (RCUs).<ref name=lofar-stations-description>{{cite web | url=https://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/users/technical-information/lofar-stations/lofar-stations-description- | title=LOFAR Stations: Description and Layout| publisher=ASTRON|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Eff+Lofar.JPG|thumb|The 60 m diameter LOFAR station consisting of 96 dipole antennas (foreground) at Bad M\u00fcnstereifel- [[Effelsberg]], next to the 100 m radio telescope (background), both run by the [[Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy]] Bonn, Germany]]\nThe locations of the international LOFAR stations are:\n* Germany<ref name=lofar-statitions-germany>{{cite web | url=http://www.lofar.org/about-lofar/general-information/european-stations/german-lofar-stations/german-lofar-stations| title=German LOFAR stations| publisher=ASTRON|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref>\n** [[Effelsberg]] - at the site of the [[Effelsberg Radio Telescope]]{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n** Unterweilenbach/[[Garching]] - run by [[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]\n** [[Tautenburg]] - at the site of the [[Th\u00fcringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg]] (Thuringian State Observatory){{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n** Potsdam-Bornim  - run by [[Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam]]{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n** [[J\u00fclich]] - run by the [[University of Bochum]], [[Jacobs University Bremen]] and [[Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich]]\n* United Kingdom<ref name=lofar-statitions-uk>{{cite web | url=http://www.lofar.org/about-lofar/general-information/european-stations/lofaruk/lofaruk| title=LOFAR:UK| publisher=ASTRON|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref> \n** [[Chilbolton]] - at the site of the [[Chilbolton Observatory]]\n* France<ref name=lofar-statitions-france>{{cite web | url=http://www.lofar.org/about-lofar/general-information/european-stations/lofar-france/lofar-france| title=LOFAR in France| publisher=ASTRON|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref> \n** [[Nan\u00e7ay]] - at the site of the [[Nan\u00e7ay Radio Telescope]]\n* Sweden<ref name=lofar-statitions-sweden>{{cite web | url=http://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/oso/radio-astronomy/lofar/Pages/default.aspx | title=LOFAR at Onsala Space Observatory| publisher= Chalmers University of Technology|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref> \n** [[Onsala]] - at the site [[Onsala Space Observatory]]{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* Poland\n** Baldy\n** Bor\u00f3wiec\n** Lazy\n* Ireland\n** [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] - at the site [[Birr Castle]]\n*Italy\n* Latvia\n** Ventspils - at the site of [[Ventspils International Radio Astronomy Centre]] in [[Irbene]]\n\n===NenuFAR===\nThe NenuFAR telescope is co-located at the [[Nan\u00e7ay radio telescope]]. It is an extension of the Nan\u00e7ay LOFAR station (FR606), adding 96 low frequency tiles, each consisting of a \"mini-array\" of 19 crossed-dipole antennas, distributed in a circle with a diameter of approximately 400 m. The tiles are a hexagonal cluster with analogically phased antennas. The telescope can capture radio frequencies in the 10-85&nbsp;MHz range, covering the LOFAR-Low Band (30-80&nbsp;MHz) range as well. The NenuFAR array can work as a high-sensitivity LOFAR-compatible super-LBA station (LSS), operating together with rest of LOFAR to increase to array's global sensitivity by nearly a factor of two, and improve the array's imaging capabilities. It can also function as a second supercore to improve array availability. Due to its dedicated receiver, NenuFAR can also operate as a standalone instrument, known as NenuFAR/Standalone in this mode.<ref name=LOFARNenuFAR>{{cite web| title=From LOFAR to NenuFAR | url=https://ufe.obspm.fr/IMG/pdf/_ferrari_iyas.pdf| accessdate=2017-06-21}}</ref><ref name=\"NenuFAR/LSS\">{{cite web| title=NenuFAR, the LOFAR Super Station | url=https://nenufar.sciencesconf.org/conference/nenufar/pages/NenuFAR_workshop.pdf | accessdate=2017-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Other stations===\n[[File:I-LOFAR telescope.jpg|thumb|The Irish LOFAR array (I-LOFAR) in [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]], County Offaly.]]\nAdditionally, a set of LOFAR antennas is deployed at the [[KAIRA]] (Kilpisj\u00e4rvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array) near [[Kilpisj\u00e4rvi]], [[Finland]].

Even then, the SKA will only observe at frequencies >50&nbsp;MHz.\n\n== Science case ==\n[[Image:7c gal.png|thumb|300px|At low radio frequencies the sky is dominated by small bright sources (shown is a 151 MHz map of the region: 140\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 Galactic longitude; -5\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 Galactic latitude). LOFAR will have sufficient fidelity and sensitivity to see faint structure between these bright sources because of the very large number of array elements.]]\n\nThe sensitivities and spatial resolutions attainable with LOFAR will make possible several fundamental new studies of the Universe as well as facilitating unique practical investigations of the Earth's environment. In the following list the term {{math|''z''}} is a [[dimensionless]] quantity indicating the [[redshift]] of the radio sources seen by LOFAR.\n* In the very distant Universe ({{math|6 < ''z'' < 10}}), LOFAR can search for the signature produced by the [[reionization]] of neutral [[hydrogen]]. This crucial phase change is predicted to occur at the epoch of the formation of the first stars and galaxies, marking the end of the so-called \"[[Chronology of the universe#Dark Ages|dark ages]]\". The [[redshift]] at which reionization is thought to occur will shift the [[Hydrogen line|21 cm line of neutral hydrogen]] at 1420.40575&nbsp;MHz into the LOFAR observing window. The frequency observed today is lower by a factor of 1/(z+1).\n* In the distant \"formative\" Universe ({{math|1.5 < ''z'' < 7}}), LOFAR will detect the most distant massive [[galaxies]] and will study the processes by which the earliest structures in the Universe (galaxies, clusters and [[active galactic nuclei|active nuclei]]) form and probe the [[intergalactic gas]].\n* In the magnetic Universe, LOFAR will map the distribution of [[cosmic rays]] and global [[magnetic fields]] in our own and nearby galaxies, in galaxy clusters and in the intergalactic medium.\n* The high-energy Universe, LOFAR will detect the [[ultra high energy cosmic rays]] as they pierce the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. A dedicated test station for this purpose, [[LOPES (telescope)|LOPES]], has been in operation since 2003.\n* Within the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, LOFAR will detect several hundred new [[pulsars]] within a few kpc from the Sun, will search for short-lived [[Transient astronomical event|transient events]] produced by stellar mergers or black hole accretion, and will search for bursts from [[Jupiter]]-like [[extrasolar planets]].<ref>{{cite conference\n | title=LOFAR Transients and the Radio Sky Monitor\n | last=Fender | first=R.

This crucial information about solar weather and its effect on Earth will facilitate predictions of costly and damaging [[geomagnetic storms]].\n* Within the Earth's immediate environment, LOFAR will map irregularities in the [[ionosphere]] continuously, detect the ionizing effects of distant [[gamma-ray burst]]s and the flashes predicted to arise from the [[ultra high energy cosmic ray|highest energy cosmic rays]], the origins of which are unclear.\n* By exploring a new spectral window LOFAR is likely to make [[serendipity|serendipitous]]  discoveries. Detection of new classes of objects or new astrophysical phenomena have resulted from almost all previous facilities that open new regions of the spectrum, or pushed instrumental parameters, such as sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude.\n\n=== Key projects ===\n\n==== The epoch of reionization ====\nOne of the most exciting, but technically most challenging, applications of LOFAR will be the search for redshifted [[21 cm line]] emission from the [[Epoch of Reionization]] (EoR).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lofar.org/astronomy/eor-ksp/epoch-reionization|title=Epoch of Reionisation| publisher=lofar.org| accessdate=2011-02-23}}</ref> It is thought that the 'Dark Ages', the period after recombination when the Universe turned neutral, lasted until around z=20. [[WMAP]] polarization results appear to suggest that there may have been extended, or even multiple phases of reionisation, the start possibly being around z~15-20 and ending at z~6. Using LOFAR, the redshift range from z=11.4 (115&nbsp;MHz) to z=6 (200&nbsp;MHz) can be probed. The expected signal is small, and disentangling it from the much stronger foreground emission is challenging.\n\n==== Deep extragalactic surveys ====\nOne of the most important applications of LOFAR will be to carry out large-sky surveys. Such surveys are well suited to the characteristics of LOFAR and have been designated as one of the key projects that have driven LOFAR since its inception. Such deep LOFAR surveys of the accessible sky at several frequencies will provide unique catalogues of radio sources for investigating several fundamental areas of astrophysics, including the formation of massive [[black hole]]s, galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Because the LOFAR surveys will probe an unexplored parameter of the Universe, it is likely that they will discover new phenomena.\n\n==== Transient radio phenomena and pulsars ====\nThe combination of low frequencies, omnidirectional antennae, high-speed data transport and computing means that LOFAR will open a new era in the monitoring of the radio sky. It will be possible to make sensitive radio maps of the entire sky visible from The Netherlands (about 60% of the entire sky) in only one night. Transient radio phenomena, only hinted at by previous narrow-field surveys, will be discovered, rapidly localised with unprecedented accuracy, and automatically compared to data from other facilities (e.g. gamma-ray, optical, X-ray observatories). Such transient phenomena may be associated with exploding stars, black holes, flares on Sun-like stars, [[radio burst]]s from exoplanets or even [[SETI]] signals. In addition, this key science project will make a deep survey for radio [[pulsar]]s at low radio frequencies, and will attempt to detect giant radio bursts from rotating [[neutron star]]s in distant galaxies.\n\n==== Ultra high-energy cosmic rays ====\nLOFAR offers a unique possibility in [[particle physics]] for studying the origin of high-energy and [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s (HECRs and UHECRs) at energies between {{math|10^{15}-10^{20.5}}} eV.<ref>[http://www.lofar.org/p/ast_sc_cosmicrays.htm LOFAR Science Case: Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110075825/http://www.lofar.org/p/ast_sc_cosmicrays.htm |date=2005-11-10 }}</ref> Both the sites and processes for accelerating particles are unknown. Possible candidate sources of these HECRs are shocks in radio lobes of powerful radio galaxies, intergalactic shocks created during the epoch of galaxy formation, so-called Hyper-novae, [[gamma-ray burst]]s, or decay products of super-massive particles from topological defects, left over from phase transitions in the early Universe. The primary observable is the intense radio pulse that is produced when a primary CR hits the atmosphere and produces an extensive air shower (EAS). An EAS is aligned along the direction of motion of the primary particle, and a substantial part of its component consists of [[Pair production|electron-positron pairs]] which emit radio emission in the terrestrial magnetosphere (e.g., geo-synchrotron emission).\n\n==== Cosmic magnetism ====\nLOFAR opens the window to the so far unexplored low-energy synchrotron radio waves, emitted by cosmic-ray electrons in weak magnetic fields. Very little is known about the origin and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields. The space around galaxies and between galaxies may all be magnetic, and LOFAR may be the first to detect weak radio emission from such regions. LOFAR will also measure the [[Faraday effect]], which is the rotation of polarization plane of low-frequency radio waves, and gives another tool to detect weak magnetic fields.<ref>[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Galactic_magnetic_fields scholarpedia.org]</ref>\n\n==== Solar physics and space weather ====\nThe Sun is an intense radio source. The already strong thermal radiation of the <math>10^{6}</math> K hot [[solar corona]] is superimposed by intense radio bursts that are associated with phenomena of the solar activity, like [[Solar flare|flares]] and [[coronal mass ejection]]s (CMEs). Solar radio radiation in the LOFAR frequency range is emitted in the middle and upper corona. So LOFAR is an ideal instrument for studies of the launch of CMEs heading towards interplanetary space. LOFAR's imaging capabilities will yield information on whether such a CMEs might hit the Earth. This makes LOFAR is a valuable instrument for [[space weather]] studies.\n\nSolar observations with LOFAR will include routine monitoring of the solar activity as the root of Space Weather. Furthermore, LOFAR's flexibility enables rapid responses to solar radio bursts with follow-up observations. Solar flares produce energetic electrons that not only lead to the emission of non-thermal solar radio radiation. The electrons also emit X-rays and heat the ambient plasma. So joint observation campaigns with other ground- and space-based instruments, e.g. [[Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager|RHESSI]], [[Hinode (satellite)|Hinode]], the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory|Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)]], and eventually the [[Advanced Technology Solar Telescope]] and the [[Solar Orbiter]] provide insights into this fundamental astrophysical process.\n\n==Timeline==\n[[Image:Zernikeborg (Zernikecomplex).JPG|thumb|The 'Zernikeborg' building, which houses the University of Groningen's computing centre]]\nIn the early 1990s, the study of aperture array technology for radio astronomy was being actively studied by [[ASTRON]] - the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. At the same time, scientific interest in a low-frequency radio telescope began to emerge at ASTRON and at the Dutch Universities. A feasibility study was carried out and international partners sought during 1999. In 2000 the Netherlands LOFAR Steering Committee was set up by the ASTRON Board with representatives from all interested Dutch university departments and ASTRON.\n\nIn November 2003 the Dutch Government allocated 52 million [[euro]] to fund the infrastructure of LOFAR under the Bsik programme. In accordance with Bsik guidelines, LOFAR was funded as a multidisciplinary sensor array to facilitate research in [[geophysics]], [[computer sciences]] and [[agriculture]] as well as [[astronomy]].\n\nIn December 2003 LOFAR's Initial Test Station (ITS) became operational. The ITS system consists of 60 inverse V-shaped dipoles; each dipole is connected to a [[low-noise amplifier]] (LNA), which provides enough amplification of the incoming signals to transport them over a 110 m long coaxial cable to the receiver unit (RCU).\n\nOn April 26, 2005, an [[IBM]] [[Blue Gene#Blue Gene/L|Blue Gene/L]] supercomputer was installed at the [[University of Groningen]]'s math centre, for LOFAR's [[data processing]]. At that time it was the second most powerful supercomputer in [[Europe]], after the [[MareNostrum]] in [[Barcelona]].<ref>[http://www.top500.org/list/2005/06/100 TOP500 List - June 2005]</ref>\nSince 2014 an even more powerful computing cluster (correlator) called COBALT performs the correlation of signals from all individual stations.<ref>[http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/supercomputing/2013/presentation/SC3132-COBALT-Correlator-LOFAR.pdf COBALT A new correlator for LOFAR. 2013]</ref>\n\nIn August/September 2006 the first LOFAR station (''Core Station CS001'', aka. CS1 {{coord|52|54|32|N|6|52|8|E|type:landmark_region:NL}}) was put in the field using pre-production hardware. A total of 96 dual-dipole antennas (the equivalent of a full LOFAR station) are grouped in four clusters, the central cluster with 48 dipoles and other three clusters with 16 dipoles each. Each cluster is about 100 m in size. The clusters are distributed over an area of ~500 m in diameter.\n\nIn November 2007 the first international LOFAR station (''DE601'') next to the [[Effelsberg]] 100 m radio telescope became the first operational station. The first fully complete station, (''CS302'') on the edge of the LOFAR core, was delivered in May 2009, with a total of 40 Dutch stations scheduled for completion in 2013. By 2014, 38 stations in the Netherlands, five stations in Germany (Effelsberg, Tautenburg, Unterweilenbach, Bornim/Potsdam, and J\u00fclich), and one each in the UK (Chilbolton), in France (Nan\u00e7ay) and in Sweden (Onsala) were operational.\n\nLOFAR was officially opened on 12 June 2010 by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.<ref>[http://astron.nl/about-astron/press-public/news/koningin-opent-nieuwe-lofar-telescoop-drenthe/koningin-opent-nieuwe-l]</ref> Regular observations started in December 2012.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ASKAP]]: Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder\n* [[KAIRA]]: Kilpisjarvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array\n* [[Long Wavelength Array (LWA)]]\n* [[LORUN]]:  LOFAR at Radboud University Nijmegen\n* [[Murchison Widefield Array]] (MWA)\n* [[MeerKAT]]: Karoo Array Telescope\n* [[Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization]]\n* [[Square Kilometre Array]]\n* [[Ukrainian T-shaped Radio telescope, second modification|Ukrainian Low-Frequency T-shaped Radio Telescope]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.lofar.org/ LOFAR website]\n*[http://www.astron.nl/ ASTRON website]\n*[http://www.lofar.de/ German LOFAR website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080201154211/http://www.lofar-uk.org/ LOFAR-UK website]\n*[http://www.lofar-se.org/ LOFAR Sweden website]\n*[http://www.obs-nancay.fr/lofar/ LOFAR France website]\n*[http://www.oa.uj.edu.pl/lofar/ LOFAR Poland website]\n*[http://www.lofar.ie/ LOFAR Ireland]\n*[http://www.sgo.fi/KAIRA/ LOFAR Finland (KAIRA) website]\n*[http://www.lofar.ie/ I-LOFAR (Ireland) website]\n*[http://www.transientskp.org/ Transients Key Science Project]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120407030615/http://www.astro.rug.nl/eor Epoch of Reionization Key Science Project]\n*[http://www.aip.de/groups/osra/sksp/ Solar Physics & Space Weather Key Science Project]\n*[http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/staff/rbeck/MKSP/mksp.html Cosmic Magnetism Key Science Project]\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=105660041867924242792.00000112909423030f0bc&ll=53.592505,14.545898&spn=18.056808,40.78125&z=5&om=1 Interactive map of possible station locations]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTIdd13kyoA A guided tour of the LOFAR-UK station]\n* LOFAR as a Probe of the Sources of Cosmological Reionisation.

The electronic signals from the antennas are digitized, transported to a central digital processor, and combined in software to emulate a conventional antenna. The project is based on an [[Interferometer|interferometric]] array of radio telescopes using about 20,000 small antennas concentrated in at least 48 stations. Forty of these stations are distributed across the Netherlands and were funded by ASTRON. The five stations in [[Germany]], and one each in [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Sweden]] and [[Ireland]], were funded by these countries. Further stations may also be built in other European countries. The total effective collecting area is approximately 300,000 square meters, depending on frequency and antenna configuration.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/technical-information/lofar-technical-information | title=System Capabilities &#124; ASTRON | access-date=2011-10-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010211516/http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/technical-information/lofar-technical-information | archive-date=2017-10-10 | url-status=dead }}</ref>{{primary inline|date=August 2019}} The data processing is performed by a [[Blue Gene#Blue Gene/P|Blue Gene/P]] [[supercomputer]] situated in the Netherlands at the [[University of Groningen]]. LOFAR is also a technology precursor for the [[Square Kilometre Array]].\n\n== Technical information ==\n[[File:A low-band antenna of LOFAR.jpg|thumb|Low-band antenna with electronics cabin in the background]]\nLOFAR was conceived as an innovative effort to force a breakthrough in sensitivity for astronomical observations at radio-frequencies below 250&nbsp;MHz. Astronomical radio interferometers usually consist either of arrays of [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic dishes]] (e.g. the [[One-Mile Telescope]] or the [[Very Large Array]]), arrays of one-dimensional antennas (e.g. the [[Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope]]) or two-dimensional arrays of [[omnidirectional antenna]]s (e.g. [[Antony Hewish]]'s [[Interplanetary Scintillation Array]]).\n\nLOFAR combines aspects of many of these earlier telescopes; in particular, it uses omnidirectional dipole antennas as elements of a [[phased array]] at individual stations, and combines those phased arrays using the [[aperture synthesis]] technique developed in the 1950s. Like the earlier [[Cambridge Low Frequency Synthesis Telescope]] (CLFST) low-frequency radio telescope, the design of LOFAR has concentrated on the use of large numbers of relatively cheap antennas without any moving parts, concentrated in stations, with the mapping performed using aperture synthesis [[software]]. The direction of observation (\"beam\") of the stations is chosen electronically by phase delays between the antennas. LOFAR can observe in several directions simultaneously, as long as their aggregated data rate remains under its cap. This in principle allows a multi-user operation.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nLOFAR makes observations in the 10&nbsp;MHz to 240&nbsp;MHz frequency range with two types of antennas: Low Band Antenna (LBA) and High Band Antenna (HBA), optimized for 10-80&nbsp;MHz and 120-240&nbsp;MHz respectively.<ref name=lofar-antennae-description>{{cite web | url=https://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/technical-information/antennae/antennae-description | title=Antenna Description| publisher=ASTRON|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref>{{primary inline|date=August 2019}} The electric signals from the LOFAR stations are digitised, transported to a central digital processor, and combined in software in order to map the sky.  Therefore, LOFAR is a \"software telescope\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.es.ele.tue.nl/gpu/downloads/handouts13.pdf| title=Many-Core Processing for the LOFAR Software Telescope}}</ref> The cost is dominated by the cost of electronics and will therefore mostly follow [[Moore's law]], becoming cheaper with time and allowing increasingly large telescopes to be built. The antennas are simple enough,{{clarify|date=August 2019}} but there are about 20,000 in the LOFAR array.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n===LOFAR stations===\nTo make radio surveys of the sky with adequate resolution, the antennas are arranged in clusters that are spread out over an area of more than 1000&nbsp;km in diameter. The LOFAR stations in the Netherlands reach baselines of about 100&nbsp;km. LOFAR currently receives data from 24 core stations (in [[Exloo]]), 14 'remote' stations in The Netherlands and 12 international stations. Each of the core and remote stations has 48 HBAs and 96 LBAs and a total of 48 digital Receiver Units (RCUs). International stations have 96 LBAs and 96 HBAs and a total of 96 digital Receiver Units (RCUs).<ref name=lofar-stations-description>{{cite web | url=https://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/users/technical-information/lofar-stations/lofar-stations-description- | title=LOFAR Stations: Description and Layout| publisher=ASTRON|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Eff+Lofar.JPG|thumb|The 60 m diameter LOFAR station consisting of 96 dipole antennas (foreground) at Bad M\u00fcnstereifel- [[Effelsberg]], next to the 100 m radio telescope (background), both run by the [[Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy]] Bonn, Germany]]\nThe locations of the international LOFAR stations are:\n* Germany<ref name=lofar-statitions-germany>{{cite web | url=http://www.lofar.org/about-lofar/general-information/european-stations/german-lofar-stations/german-lofar-stations| title=German LOFAR stations| publisher=ASTRON|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref>\n** [[Effelsberg]] - at the site of the [[Effelsberg Radio Telescope]]{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n** Unterweilenbach/[[Garching]] - run by [[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]\n** [[Tautenburg]] - at the site of the [[Th\u00fcringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg]] (Thuringian State Observatory){{cn|date=August 2019}}\n** Potsdam-Bornim  - run by [[Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam]]{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n** [[J\u00fclich]] - run by the [[University of Bochum]], [[Jacobs University Bremen]] and [[Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich]]\n* United Kingdom<ref name=lofar-statitions-uk>{{cite web | url=http://www.lofar.org/about-lofar/general-information/european-stations/lofaruk/lofaruk| title=LOFAR:UK| publisher=ASTRON|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref> \n** [[Chilbolton]] - at the site of the [[Chilbolton Observatory]]\n* France<ref name=lofar-statitions-france>{{cite web | url=http://www.lofar.org/about-lofar/general-information/european-stations/lofar-france/lofar-france| title=LOFAR in France| publisher=ASTRON|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref> \n** [[Nan\u00e7ay]] - at the site of the [[Nan\u00e7ay Radio Telescope]]\n* Sweden<ref name=lofar-statitions-sweden>{{cite web | url=http://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/oso/radio-astronomy/lofar/Pages/default.aspx | title=LOFAR at Onsala Space Observatory| publisher= Chalmers University of Technology|access-date=2015-05-12}}</ref> \n** [[Onsala]] - at the site [[Onsala Space Observatory]]{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Poland\n** Baldy\n** Bor\u00f3wiec\n** Lazy\n* Ireland\n** [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] - at the site [[Birr Castle]]\n*Italy\n* Latvia\n** Ventspils - at the site of [[Ventspils International Radio Astronomy Centre]] in [[Irbene]]\n\n===NenuFAR===\nThe NenuFAR telescope is co-located at the [[Nan\u00e7ay radio telescope]]. It is an extension of the Nan\u00e7ay LOFAR station (FR606), adding 96 low frequency tiles, each consisting of a \"mini-array\" of 19 crossed-dipole antennas, distributed in a circle with a diameter of approximately 400 m. The tiles are a hexagonal cluster with analogically phased antennas. The telescope can capture radio frequencies in the 10-85 MHz range, covering the LOFAR-Low Band (30-80 MHz) range as well. The NenuFAR array can work as a high-sensitivity LOFAR-compatible super-LBA station (LSS), operating together with rest of LOFAR to increase to array's global sensitivity by nearly a factor of two, and improve the array's imaging capabilities. It can also function as a second supercore to improve array availability. Due to its dedicated receiver, NenuFAR can also operate as a standalone instrument, known as NenuFAR/Standalone in this mode.<ref name=LOFARNenuFAR>{{cite web| title=From LOFAR to NenuFAR | url=https://ufe.obspm.fr/IMG/pdf/_ferrari_iyas.pdf| accessdate=2017-06-21}}</ref><ref name=\"NenuFAR/LSS\">{{cite web| title=NenuFAR, the LOFAR Super Station | url=https://nenufar.sciencesconf.org/conference/nenufar/pages/NenuFAR_workshop.pdf | accessdate=2017-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Other stations===\n[[File:I-LOFAR telescope.jpg|thumb|The Irish LOFAR array (I-LOFAR) in [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]], County Offaly.]]\nAdditionally, a set of LOFAR antennas is deployed at the [[KAIRA]] (Kilpisj\u00e4rvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array) near [[Kilpisj\u00e4rvi]], [[Finland]].

Even then, the SKA will only observe at frequencies >50 MHz.\n\n== Science case ==\n[[Image:7c gal.png|thumb|300px|At low radio frequencies the sky is dominated by small bright sources (shown is a 151 MHz map of the region: 140\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 Galactic longitude; -5\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 Galactic latitude). LOFAR will have sufficient fidelity and sensitivity to see faint structure between these bright sources because of the very large number of array elements.]]\n\nThe sensitivities and spatial resolutions attainable with LOFAR will make possible several fundamental new studies of the Universe as well as facilitating unique practical investigations of the Earth's environment. In the following list the term {{math|''z''}} is a [[dimensionless]] quantity indicating the [[redshift]] of the radio sources seen by LOFAR.\n* In the very distant Universe ({{math|6 < ''z'' < 10}}), LOFAR can search for the signature produced by the [[reionization]] of neutral [[hydrogen]]. This crucial phase change is predicted to occur at the epoch of the formation of the first stars and galaxies, marking the end of the so-called \"[[Chronology of the universe#Dark Ages|dark ages]]\". The [[redshift]] at which reionization is thought to occur will shift the [[Hydrogen line|21 cm line of neutral hydrogen]] at 1420.40575&nbsp;MHz into the LOFAR observing window. The frequency observed today is lower by a factor of 1/(z+1).\n* In the distant \"formative\" Universe ({{math|1.5 < ''z'' < 7}}), LOFAR will detect the most distant massive [[galaxies]] and will study the processes by which the earliest structures in the Universe (galaxies, clusters and [[active galactic nuclei|active nuclei]]) form and probe the [[intergalactic gas]].\n* In the magnetic Universe, LOFAR will map the distribution of [[cosmic rays]] and global [[magnetic fields]] in our own and nearby galaxies, in galaxy clusters and in the intergalactic medium.\n* The high-energy Universe, LOFAR will detect the [[ultra high energy cosmic rays]] as they pierce the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. A dedicated test station for this purpose, [[LOPES (telescope)|LOPES]], has been in operation since 2003.\n* Within the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, LOFAR will detect several hundred new [[pulsars]] within a few kpc from the Sun, will search for short-lived [[Transient astronomical event|transient events]] produced by stellar mergers or black hole accretion, and will search for bursts from [[Jupiter]]-like [[extrasolar planets]].<ref>{{cite conference\n | title=LOFAR Transients and the Radio Sky Monitor\n | last=Fender | first=R. P.\n | booktitle=Proceedings of \"Bursts, Pulses and Flickering: wide-field monitoring of the dynamic radio sky\"\n | date=June 12\u201315, 2007 | location=Kerastari, Tripolis, Greece\n | page=30 | bibcode=2007wmdr.confE..30F }}</ref>\n* Within the Solar System, LOFAR will detect [[coronal mass ejections]] from the Sun and provide continuous large-scale maps of the [[solar wind]]. This crucial information about solar weather and its effect on Earth will facilitate predictions of costly and damaging [[geomagnetic storms]].\n* Within the Earth's immediate environment, LOFAR will map irregularities in the [[ionosphere]] continuously, detect the ionizing effects of distant [[gamma-ray burst]]s and the flashes predicted to arise from the [[ultra high energy cosmic ray|highest energy cosmic rays]], the origins of which are unclear.\n* By exploring a new spectral window LOFAR is likely to make [[serendipity|serendipitous]]  discoveries. Detection of new classes of objects or new astrophysical phenomena have resulted from almost all previous facilities that open new regions of the spectrum, or pushed instrumental parameters, such as sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude.\n\n=== Key projects ===\n\n==== The epoch of reionization ====\nOne of the most exciting, but technically most challenging, applications of LOFAR will be the search for redshifted [[21 cm line]] emission from the [[Epoch of Reionization]] (EoR).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lofar.org/astronomy/eor-ksp/epoch-reionization|title=Epoch of Reionisation| publisher=lofar.org| accessdate=2011-02-23}}</ref> It is thought that the 'Dark Ages', the period after recombination when the Universe turned neutral, lasted until around z=20. [[WMAP]] polarization results appear to suggest that there may have been extended, or even multiple phases of reionisation, the start possibly being around z~15-20 and ending at z~6. Using LOFAR, the redshift range from z=11.4 (115&nbsp;MHz) to z=6 (200&nbsp;MHz) can be probed. The expected signal is small, and disentangling it from the much stronger foreground emission is challenging.\n\n==== Deep extragalactic surveys ====\nOne of the most important applications of LOFAR will be to carry out large-sky surveys. Such surveys are well suited to the characteristics of LOFAR and have been designated as one of the key projects that have driven LOFAR since its inception. Such deep LOFAR surveys of the accessible sky at several frequencies will provide unique catalogues of radio sources for investigating several fundamental areas of astrophysics, including the formation of massive [[black hole]]s, galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Because the LOFAR surveys will probe an unexplored parameter of the Universe, it is likely that they will discover new phenomena.\n\n==== Transient radio phenomena and pulsars ====\nThe combination of low frequencies, omnidirectional antennae, high-speed data transport and computing means that LOFAR will open a new era in the monitoring of the radio sky. It will be possible to make sensitive radio maps of the entire sky visible from The Netherlands (about 60% of the entire sky) in only one night. Transient radio phenomena, only hinted at by previous narrow-field surveys, will be discovered, rapidly localised with unprecedented accuracy, and automatically compared to data from other facilities (e.g. gamma-ray, optical, X-ray observatories). Such transient phenomena may be associated with exploding stars, black holes, flares on Sun-like stars, [[radio burst]]s from exoplanets or even [[SETI]] signals. In addition, this key science project will make a deep survey for radio [[pulsar]]s at low radio frequencies, and will attempt to detect giant radio bursts from rotating [[neutron star]]s in distant galaxies.\n\n==== Ultra high-energy cosmic rays ====\nLOFAR offers a unique possibility in [[particle physics]] for studying the origin of high-energy and [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s (HECRs and UHECRs) at energies between {{math|10^{15}-10^{20.5}}} eV.<ref>[http://www.lofar.org/p/ast_sc_cosmicrays.htm LOFAR Science Case: Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110075825/http://www.lofar.org/p/ast_sc_cosmicrays.htm |date=2005-11-10 }}</ref> Both the sites and processes for accelerating particles are unknown. Possible candidate sources of these HECRs are shocks in radio lobes of powerful radio galaxies, intergalactic shocks created during the epoch of galaxy formation, so-called Hyper-novae, [[gamma-ray burst]]s, or decay products of super-massive particles from topological defects, left over from phase transitions in the early Universe. The primary observable is the intense radio pulse that is produced when a primary CR hits the atmosphere and produces an extensive air shower (EAS). An EAS is aligned along the direction of motion of the primary particle, and a substantial part of its component consists of [[Pair production|electron-positron pairs]] which emit radio emission in the terrestrial magnetosphere (e.g., geo-synchrotron emission).\n\n==== Cosmic magnetism ====\nLOFAR opens the window to the so far unexplored low-energy synchrotron radio waves, emitted by cosmic-ray electrons in weak magnetic fields. Very little is known about the origin and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields. The space around galaxies and between galaxies may all be magnetic, and LOFAR may be the first to detect weak radio emission from such regions. LOFAR will also measure the [[Faraday effect]], which is the rotation of polarization plane of low-frequency radio waves, and gives another tool to detect weak magnetic fields.<ref>[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Galactic_magnetic_fields scholarpedia.org]</ref>\n\n==== Solar physics and space weather ====\nThe Sun is an intense radio source. The already strong thermal radiation of the <math>10^{6}</math> K hot [[Corona|solar corona]] is superimposed by intense radio bursts that are associated with phenomena of the solar activity, like [[Solar flare|flares]] and [[coronal mass ejection]]s (CMEs). Solar radio radiation in the LOFAR frequency range is emitted in the middle and upper corona. So LOFAR is an ideal instrument for studies of the launch of CMEs heading towards interplanetary space. LOFAR's imaging capabilities will yield information on whether such a CMEs might hit the Earth. This makes LOFAR is a valuable instrument for [[space weather]] studies.\n\nSolar observations with LOFAR will include routine monitoring of the solar activity as the root of Space Weather. Furthermore, LOFAR's flexibility enables rapid responses to solar radio bursts with follow-up observations. Solar flares produce energetic electrons that not only lead to the emission of non-thermal solar radio radiation. The electrons also emit X-rays and heat the ambient plasma. So joint observation campaigns with other ground- and space-based instruments, e.g. [[Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager|RHESSI]], [[Hinode (satellite)|Hinode]], the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory|Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)]], and eventually the [[Advanced Technology Solar Telescope]] and the [[Solar Orbiter]] provide insights into this fundamental astrophysical process.\n\n==Timeline==\n[[Image:Zernikeborg (Zernikecomplex).JPG|thumb|The 'Zernikeborg' building, which houses the University of Groningen's computing centre]]\nIn the early 1990s, the study of aperture array technology for radio astronomy was being actively studied by [[ASTRON]] - the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. At the same time, scientific interest in a low-frequency radio telescope began to emerge at ASTRON and at the Dutch Universities. A feasibility study was carried out and international partners sought during 1999. In 2000 the Netherlands LOFAR Steering Committee was set up by the ASTRON Board with representatives from all interested Dutch university departments and ASTRON.\n\nIn November 2003 the Dutch Government allocated 52 million [[euro]] to fund the infrastructure of LOFAR under the Bsik programme. In accordance with Bsik guidelines, LOFAR was funded as a multidisciplinary sensor array to facilitate research in [[geophysics]], [[computer sciences]] and [[agriculture]] as well as [[astronomy]].\n\nIn December 2003 LOFAR's Initial Test Station (ITS) became operational. The ITS system consists of 60 inverse V-shaped dipoles; each dipole is connected to a [[low-noise amplifier]] (LNA), which provides enough amplification of the incoming signals to transport them over a 110 m long coaxial cable to the receiver unit (RCU).\n\nOn April 26, 2005, an [[IBM]] [[Blue Gene#Blue Gene/L|Blue Gene/L]] supercomputer was installed at the [[University of Groningen]]'s math centre, for LOFAR's [[data processing]]. At that time it was the second most powerful supercomputer in [[Europe]], after the [[MareNostrum]] in [[Barcelona]].<ref>[http://www.top500.org/list/2005/06/100 TOP500 List - June 2005]</ref>\nSince 2014 an even more powerful computing cluster (correlator) called COBALT performs the correlation of signals from all individual stations.<ref>[http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/supercomputing/2013/presentation/SC3132-COBALT-Correlator-LOFAR.pdf COBALT A new correlator for LOFAR. 2013]</ref>\n\nIn August/September 2006 the first LOFAR station (''Core Station CS001'', aka. CS1 {{coord|52|54|32|N|6|52|8|E|type:landmark_region:NL}}) was put in the field using pre-production hardware. A total of 96 dual-dipole antennas (the equivalent of a full LOFAR station) are grouped in four clusters, the central cluster with 48 dipoles and other three clusters with 16 dipoles each. Each cluster is about 100 m in size. The clusters are distributed over an area of ~500 m in diameter.\n\nIn November 2007 the first international LOFAR station (''DE601'') next to the [[Effelsberg]] 100 m radio telescope became the first operational station. The first fully complete station, (''CS302'') on the edge of the LOFAR core, was delivered in May 2009, with a total of 40 Dutch stations scheduled for completion in 2013. By 2014, 38 stations in the Netherlands, five stations in Germany (Effelsberg, Tautenburg, Unterweilenbach, Bornim/Potsdam, and J\u00fclich), and one each in the UK (Chilbolton), in France (Nan\u00e7ay) and in Sweden (Onsala) were operational.\n\nLOFAR was officially opened on 12 June 2010 by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.<ref>[http://astron.nl/about-astron/press-public/news/koningin-opent-nieuwe-lofar-telescoop-drenthe/koningin-opent-nieuwe-l]</ref> Regular observations started in December 2012.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ASKAP]]: Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder\n* [[KAIRA]]: Kilpisjarvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array\n* [[Long Wavelength Array (LWA)]]\n* [[LORUN]]:  LOFAR at Radboud University Nijmegen\n* [[Murchison Widefield Array]] (MWA)\n* [[MeerKAT]]: Karoo Array Telescope\n* [[Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization]]\n* [[Square Kilometre Array]]\n* [[Ukrainian T-shaped Radio telescope, second modification|Ukrainian Low-Frequency T-shaped Radio Telescope]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.lofar.org/ LOFAR website]\n*[http://www.astron.nl/ ASTRON website]\n*[http://www.lofar.de/ German LOFAR website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080201154211/http://www.lofar-uk.org/ LOFAR-UK website]\n*[http://www.lofar-se.org/ LOFAR Sweden website]\n*[http://www.obs-nancay.fr/lofar/ LOFAR France website]\n*[http://www.oa.uj.edu.pl/lofar/ LOFAR Poland website]\n*[http://www.lofar.ie/ LOFAR Ireland]\n*[http://www.sgo.fi/KAIRA/ LOFAR Finland (KAIRA) website]\n*[http://www.lofar.ie/ I-LOFAR (Ireland) website]\n*[http://www.transientskp.org/ Transients Key Science Project]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120407030615/http://www.astro.rug.nl/eor Epoch of Reionization Key Science Project]\n*[http://www.aip.de/groups/osra/sksp/ Solar Physics & Space Weather Key Science Project]\n*[http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/staff/rbeck/MKSP/mksp.html Cosmic Magnetism Key Science Project]\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=105660041867924242792.00000112909423030f0bc&ll=53.592505,14.545898&spn=18.056808,40.78125&z=5&om=1 Interactive map of possible station locations]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTIdd13kyoA A guided tour of the LOFAR-UK station]\n* LOFAR as a Probe of the Sources of Cosmological Reionisation.
