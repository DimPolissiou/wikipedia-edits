In the spring of 1951, the 10th and 11th Ranger Companies wore black berets during their training at Camp Carson, Colorado, before their deployment to Japan.\n\nIn the post-Vietnam era, morale in the U.S. Army waned. In response, from 1973 through 1979 Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing uniform distinctions. Consequently, many units embraced various color berets, for example armor and armored cavalry units often adopted the black beret. Similarly, many other units embraced various colored berets in an attempt to improve dwindling morale. In particular, the First Cavalry Division assigned various colored berets to its three-pronged TRICAP approach.

In the spring of 1951, the 10th and 11th Ranger Companies wore black berets during their training at Camp Carson, Colorado, before their deployment to Japan.\n\nIn the post-Vietnam era, morale in the U.S. Army waned. In response, from 1973 through 1979 Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing uniform distinctions. Consequently, many units embraced various color berets, for example armor and armored cavalry units often adopted the black beret. Similarly, many other units embraced various colored berets in an attempt to improve dwindling morale. In particular, the First Cavalry Division assigned various colored berets to its three-pronged TRICAP approach. In this implementation, armored cavalry, airmobile infantry units, air cavalry units, division artillery units, and division support units all wore different colored berets, including black, light blue, kelly green, and red.\n\n==Black==\n[[File:PEO Soldier illustration of Black Beret portrait.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Army Sergeant wearing black beret, circa 2008]]\n{{main|Black beret}}\nA black beret was authorized for wear by female soldiers in 1975, but was of a different design than men's berets.

The novel coronavirus has similar characteristics to [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) and [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). Within a number of weeks, several thousand people in [[Hubei]]'s provincial capital of Wuhan were infected, and the Chinese central government imposed strict containment measures, including a [[2020 Hubei lockdowns|lockdown of Hubei]] itself.\n\nDue to the effective lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei, and the continued growth of the outbreak in these locations, several countries planned to evacuate their citizens and/or diplomatic staff from the area. This was done primarily through [[air charter|chartered flights]] of the home nations, which were provided prior clearance by Chinese authorities. Japan, India, the United States, France, Australia, [[Sri Lanka]], Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thediplomat.com/2020/01/countries-evaluate-evacuation-of-citizens-amid-wuhan-coronavirus-panic/ |title=Countries Evaluate Evacuation of Citizens Amid Wuhan Coronavirus Panic |agency=Associated Press|website=thediplomat.com |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128150819/https://thediplomat.com/2020/01/countries-evaluate-evacuation-of-citizens-amid-wuhan-coronavirus-panic/ |archive-date=28 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-india-citizens-china-wuhan-air-india-second-flight-1642434-2020-02-01/ |title=Coronavirus: Second plane carrying 323 Indians from Wuhan to reach Delhi today |last=Press |first=ANI |website=indiatoday.in |access-date=2 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202040329/https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-india-citizens-china-wuhan-air-india-second-flight-1642434-2020-02-01 |archive-date=2 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/01/27/belgie-haalt-15-landgenoten-terug-uit-hubei-na-uitbraak-coronav/ |title=Belgi\u00eb haalt landgenoten terug uit Chinese provincie Hubei na uitbraak coronavirus |last=NWS |first=VRT |date=27 January 2020 |website=vrtnws.be}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jakartaglobe.id/news/lastminute-preparations-underway-to-evacuate-indonesian-citizens-from-coronavirusravaged-wuhan |title=Last-Minute Preparations Underway to Evacuate Indonesian Citizens From Coronavirus-Ravaged Wuhan |last=Nathalia |first=Telly |date=30 January 2020 |website=Jakarta Globe}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1844104/c130-aircraft-on-standby-for-wuhan-evacuation |title=C130 aircraft on standby for Wuhan evacuation |date=26 January 2020 |work=Bangkok Post |access-date=26 January 2020}}</ref><ref name=20200125cnn>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/25/politics/coronavirus-us-evacuate-americans-china/index.html |title=US arranging charter flight to evacuate American diplomats and citizens out of China amid coronavirus outbreak, official says |last=Jiang |first=Steven |date=25 January 2020 |access-date=27 January 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126100201/https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/25/politics/coronavirus-us-evacuate-americans-china/index.html |archive-date=26 January 2020 |last2=Stracqualursi |first2=Veronica |publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref name=20200129tempo>{{Cite news |url=http://tempo.com.ph/2020/01/29/ph-sending-special-flights-to-get-pinoys-from-wuhan-hubei-in-china/ |title=PH sending special flights to get Pinoys from Wuhan, Hubei in China |date=29 January 2020 |work=Tempo |access-date=29 January 2020}}</ref> Pakistan has said that it will not be evacuating any citizens from China due to lack of domestic facilities to help treat Pakistanis who may be infected.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/coronavirus-asia-asean-live-updates-by-country/ |title = The Coronavirus in Asia and ASEAN \u2013 Live Updates by Country|date = 21 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=20200131dialoguepakistan>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dialoguepakistan.com/pakistan-cancels-flights-to-china-as-fears-of-coronavirus-spread/|title=Pakistan cancels flights to China as fears of coronavirus spread|date=31 January 2020|website=Dialogue Pakistan|access-date=31 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131125705/https://www.dialoguepakistan.com/pakistan-cancels-flights-to-china-as-fears-of-coronavirus-spread/|archive-date=31 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==International evacuations==\n\n===Statistical overview===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!

The novel coronavirus has similar characteristics to [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) and [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). Within a number of weeks, several thousand people in [[Hubei]]'s provincial capital of Wuhan were infected, and the Chinese central government imposed strict containment measures, including a [[2020 Hubei lockdowns|lockdown of Hubei]] itself.\n\nDue to the effective lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei, and the continued growth of the outbreak in these locations, several countries planned to evacuate their citizens and/or diplomatic staff from the area. This was done primarily through [[air charter|chartered flights]] of the home nations, which were provided prior clearance by Chinese authorities. Japan, India, the United States, France, Australia, [[Sri Lanka]], Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thediplomat.com/2020/01/countries-evaluate-evacuation-of-citizens-amid-wuhan-coronavirus-panic/ |title=Countries Evaluate Evacuation of Citizens Amid Wuhan Coronavirus Panic |agency=Associated Press|website=thediplomat.com |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128150819/https://thediplomat.com/2020/01/countries-evaluate-evacuation-of-citizens-amid-wuhan-coronavirus-panic/ |archive-date=28 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-india-citizens-china-wuhan-air-india-second-flight-1642434-2020-02-01/ |title=Coronavirus: Second plane carrying 323 Indians from Wuhan to reach Delhi today |last=Press |first=ANI |website=indiatoday.in |access-date=2 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202040329/https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-india-citizens-china-wuhan-air-india-second-flight-1642434-2020-02-01 |archive-date=2 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/01/27/belgie-haalt-15-landgenoten-terug-uit-hubei-na-uitbraak-coronav/ |title=Belgi\u00eb haalt landgenoten terug uit Chinese provincie Hubei na uitbraak coronavirus |last=NWS |first=VRT |date=27 January 2020 |website=vrtnws.be}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jakartaglobe.id/news/lastminute-preparations-underway-to-evacuate-indonesian-citizens-from-coronavirusravaged-wuhan |title=Last-Minute Preparations Underway to Evacuate Indonesian Citizens From Coronavirus-Ravaged Wuhan |last=Nathalia |first=Telly |date=30 January 2020 |website=Jakarta Globe}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1844104/c130-aircraft-on-standby-for-wuhan-evacuation |title=C130 aircraft on standby for Wuhan evacuation |date=26 January 2020 |work=Bangkok Post |access-date=26 January 2020}}</ref><ref name=20200125cnn>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/25/politics/coronavirus-us-evacuate-americans-china/index.html |title=US arranging charter flight to evacuate American diplomats and citizens out of China amid coronavirus outbreak, official says |last=Jiang |first=Steven |date=25 January 2020 |access-date=27 January 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126100201/https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/25/politics/coronavirus-us-evacuate-americans-china/index.html |archive-date=26 January 2020 |last2=Stracqualursi |first2=Veronica |publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref name=20200129tempo>{{Cite news |url=http://tempo.com.ph/2020/01/29/ph-sending-special-flights-to-get-pinoys-from-wuhan-hubei-in-china/ |title=PH sending special flights to get Pinoys from Wuhan, Hubei in China |date=29 January 2020 |work=Tempo |access-date=29 January 2020}}</ref> Pakistan has said that it will not be evacuating any citizens from China due to lack of domestic facilities to help treat Pakistanis who may be infected.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/coronavirus-asia-asean-live-updates-by-country/ |title = The Coronavirus in Asia and ASEAN \u2013 Live Updates by Country|date = 21 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=20200131dialoguepakistan>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dialoguepakistan.com/pakistan-cancels-flights-to-china-as-fears-of-coronavirus-spread/|title=Pakistan cancels flights to China as fears of coronavirus spread|date=31 January 2020|website=Dialogue Pakistan|access-date=31 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131125705/https://www.dialoguepakistan.com/pakistan-cancels-flights-to-china-as-fears-of-coronavirus-spread/|archive-date=31 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==International evacuations==\n\n===Statistical overview===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!

The British government plans to send another plane if necessary.<ref name=bbc51318691>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51318691 |title=Britons on Wuhan evacuation flight land in UK |date=31 January 2020 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131033523/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51318691 |archive-date=31 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=bbc51304204>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51304204 |title=British evacuation flight out of Wuhan delayed |date=30 January 2020 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130104111/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51304204 |archive-date=30 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=bbc51325192>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51325192 |title=Two coronavirus cases confirmed in UK |date=31 January 2020 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131094339/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51325192 |archive-date=31 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|{{FRA}}\n|180<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20200131-plane-carrying-french-citizens-out-of-virus-hit-wuhan-lands-in-south-of-france |title=Coronavirus tests on two French citizens evacuated from China turn out negative |date=2020-01-31 |work=france24 |accessdate=2020-02-02 |author1=france24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202041533/https://www.france24.com/en/20200131-plane-carrying-french-citizens-out-of-virus-hit-wuhan-lands-in-south-of-france |archive-date=2020-02-02 }}</ref>\n|\n|[[Istres-Le Tub\u00e9 Air Base]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|rowspan=\"3\"|{{CHN}}\n|76<ref>{{Cite web |title=\u9996\u67b6\u6c11\u822a\u5305\u673a\u642d\u8f7d\u6ede\u7559\u6d77\u5916\u7684\u6e56\u5317\u540c\u80de\u62b5\u8fbe\u6b66\u6c49 |url=https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/fyrbt_673021/t1738079.shtml |accessdate=2020-02-02 |date=2020-01-31 |work=[[\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u5916\u4ea4\u90e8]] |language=zh-CN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201080846/https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/fyrbt_673021/t1738079.shtml |archive-date=2020-02-01 }}</ref>\n|\n|{{flagicon|TH}} [[Suvarnabhumi International Airport]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Wuhan Tianhe International Airport]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|124<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202001/31/WS5e340259e4b0e6e58393da6f.html |title=\u51c6\u5907\u8d77\u98de\uff01\u7956\u56fd\u6d3e\u4e13\u673a\u63a5\u6ede\u7559\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u7684\u6b66\u6c49\u540c\u80de\u56de\u5bb6 |work=www.bjd.com.cn |access-date=2020-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203084415/http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202001/31/WS5e340259e4b0e6e58393da6f.html |archive-date=2020-02-03 }}</ref>\n|\n|{{flagicon|MYS}}[[Kota Kinabalu International Airport]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|111<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202002/02/WS5e361f16e4b002ffe9940422.html |title=\u56de\u5bb6\uff01\u6625\u79cb\u822a\u7a7a\u6d3e\u5305\u673a\u8d74\u65e5\u63a5\u6b66\u6c49\u65c5\u5ba2\u8fd4\u4e61 |work=www.bjd.com.cn |access-date=2020-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203082426/http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202002/02/WS5e361f16e4b002ffe9940422.html |archive-date=2020-02-03 }}</ref>\n|\n|{{flagicon|JPN}}[[Tokyo Haneda Airport]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|{{GER}}\n|124<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.dw.com/de/china-r%C3%BCckkehrer-in-frankfurt-gelandet/a-52225109 |title=China-R\u00fcckkehrer in Frankfurt gelandet |work=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=2020-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202012008/https://www.dw.com/de/china-r%C3%BCckkehrer-in-frankfurt-gelandet/a-52225109 |archive-date=2020-02-02 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.dw.com/zh/\u5fb7\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5df2\u6d3e\u51fa\u519b\u673a\u524d\u5f80\u6b66\u6c49\u64a4\u4fa8/a-52216460 |title=\u5fb7\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\uff1a\u5df2\u6d3e\u51fa\u519b\u673a\u524d\u5f80\u6b66\u6c49\u64a4\u4fa8 |access-date=2020-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202201855/https://www.dw.com/zh/%E5%BE%B7%E5%9B%BD%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E5%B7%B2%E6%B4%BE%E5%87%BA%E5%86%9B%E6%9C%BA%E5%89%8D%E5%BE%80%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E6%92%A4%E4%BE%A8/a-52216460 |archive-date=2020-02-02 }}</ref>\n|\n| rowspan=\"10\" |{{flagicon|CHN}}[[Wuhan Tianhe International Airport]]\n|[[Frankfurt Airport]]\n|The [[German Air Force]] plane was denied a [[layover|stopover]] in Moscow after its starting point in Wuhan, according to the [[List of German defence ministers|German Minister of Defence]].
