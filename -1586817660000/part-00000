The E.V was the last Fokker design to become operational with the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]],'' entering service in the last months of [[World War I]]. After several fatal accidents due to wing failures, the aircraft was modified and redesignated '''Fokker D.VIII'''. Dubbed the ''Flying Razor'' by Allied pilots, the D.VIII had the distinction of scoring the last aerial victory of the war.\n\n==Design and development==\nIn early 1918, Fokker produced several rotary-powered monoplane prototypes, submitting '''V.26''' and '''V.28''', small parasol-winged monoplanes with his usual steel-tube fuselages, for the second fighter trials at [[Adlershof]] in May/June 1918. V.28 was tested with the 108&nbsp;kW (145&nbsp;hp) [[Motorenfabrik Oberursel|Oberursel Ur.III]] and 119&nbsp;kW (160&nbsp;hp) Goebel Goe.III, though neither of these engines were ready for operational service. The V.26 used the standard [[Motorenfabrik Oberursel|Oberursel]] [[Le Rh\u00f4ne 9J|Ur.II engine]], producing only 82&nbsp;kW (110&nbsp;hp). The engine was obsolete but the low drag of the V.26 and light weight meant that it was still quite fast. The Fokker designs were only barely beaten by the [[Siemens-Schuckert D.IV|Siemens-Schuckert D.III]] with the complex bi-rotary [[Siemens-Halske Sh.III]] engine and the V.26 was ordered into production as the '''Fokker E.V.'''  Four hundred were ordered immediately with either the Ur.III or Goe.III. Because neither engine was available in any quantity, all production examples mounted the Ur.II.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Fokev.jpg|thumb|right|'''Fokker E.V''']]\n[[File:Fokd8-2.jpg|thumb|right|'''Fokker E.V''']]\n\nThe first production E.V aircraft were shipped to [[Jagdstaffel 6|''Jasta'' 6]] in late July. The new monoplane was also delivered to ''Jasta'' 1, ''Jasta'' 19, ''Jasta'' 24 and ''Jasta'' 36. ''Leutnant'' Emil Rolff scored the first kill in an E.V on August 17, 1918, but two days later he was killed when his aircraft's wing collapsed in flight. After another E.V of ''Jasta'' 19 crashed, ''[[Idflieg]]'' grounded all E.V aircraft. Pending the investigation of these wing failures, production ceased at the Fokker Flugzeugwerke. According to Fokker, the wing failures were caused by the army technical bureau, which had forced him to modify the original design by over-strengthening the [[Spar (aeronautics)|rear main spar]]. This faulty design allegedly caused the wing to twist and fail. Fokker claimed that this defect was resolved by reverting to his original design.\n\nAccording to most other accounts, the source of the wing failures lay not in the design, but in shoddy and rushed construction. Fokker had subcontracted construction of the E.V wings to the Gebr\u00fcder Perzina Pianoforte Fabrik factory. Due to poor quality control, inferior timber had been used and the [[Spar (aeronautics)#Wooden construction|spar caps]], forming the upper and lower members of each spar assembly, had been placed too far apart during the fabrication. Because the resulting spars were vertically too large to pass through the ribs, excess material was simply planed away from the exposed upper and lower surfaces of the cap pieces, leaving the assembled spars dangerously weak. Other problems included water damage to glued parts, and pins that splintered the spars, rather than securing them.<ref>Connors, John F., \"''Fokker's Flying Razors''\", Wings, Granada Hills, California, August 1974, Volume 4, Number 4, pages 45, 48.</ref>\n\nTests showed that, when properly constructed, the original E.V wing had a considerable margin of safety. Satisfied that the basic design was safe, ''[[Idflieg]]'' authorized continued production, after personnel changes and improved quality control measures were introduced  at the Perzina factory.\n\nDeliveries resumed in October. At the direction of the ''Kogenluft'' (''Kommandierenden General der Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte''), ''Idflieg'' redesignated the modified aircraft '''D.VIII'''. The earlier \"E.\" and \"Dr.\" prefixes for fighter monoplanes and triplanes, respectively, were abolished and all fighters would henceforth receive the \"D.\" prefix instead. The D.VIII commenced operations on 24 October with [[Jasta 11|''Jasta'' 11]]. The aircraft proved to be agile and easy to fly.  Allied pilots nicknamed it the ''Flying Razor'', presumably because it resembled a cocked straight razor in flight.\n\n''Jasta'' 5 was issued a D.VIII. The famed ace [[Erich Lowenhardt]] performed a test flight of a Fokker EV whilst paying a visit to Jasta 6 in the summer of 1918, but no evidence of him flying this aircraft on any other occasion exists to date.\n\nA total of 381 aircraft were produced, but only some 85 aircraft reached frontline service before the Armistice. Some reached Italy, Japan, the United States, and England as trophies, but most were scrapped in accordance with the terms of the Armistice.\n\n===Postwar===\nThe [[Polish Air Force]] captured 17 aircraft, but only seven (six E.V and one D.VIII) were in airworthy condition. All were used against Soviet forces in the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919-1920. Lieutenant Stefan Stec earned the first kill for the Polish Air Force, by shooting down a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Nieuport 11]] ''B\u00e9b\u00e9'' fighter on 29 April 1919. In 1921, the remaining Fokkers were withdrawn from front-line units and transferred to the ''Szko\u0142a Obs\u0142ugi Lotniczej'' (Air Personnel School) at [[Port lotniczy Pozna\u0144-\u0141awica|Pozna\u0144-\u0141awica]] airfield.\n\n==Variants==\n* '''V 26''' : Initial prototype.\n* '''V 27''' : V.26 with {{convert|195|hp|kW|abbr=on|0}} [[Benz IIIb]] [[V8 engine]].

The engine was obsolete but the low drag of the V.26 and light weight meant that it was still quite fast. The Fokker designs were only barely beaten by the [[Siemens-Schuckert D.IV|Siemens-Schuckert D.III]] with the complex bi-rotary [[Siemens-Halske Sh.III]] engine and the V.26 was ordered into production as the '''Fokker E.V.'''  Four hundred were ordered immediately with either the Ur.III or Goe.III. Because neither engine was available in any quantity, all production examples mounted the Ur.II.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Fokev.jpg|thumb|right|'''Fokker E.V''']]\n[[File:Fokd8-2.jpg|thumb|right|'''Fokker E.V''']]\n\nThe first production E.V aircraft were shipped to [[Jagdstaffel 6|''Jasta'' 6]] in late July. The new monoplane was also delivered to ''Jasta'' 1, ''Jasta'' 19, ''Jasta'' 24 and ''Jasta'' 36. ''Leutnant'' Emil Rolff scored the first kill in an E.V on August 17, 1918, but two days later he was killed when his aircraft's wing collapsed in flight. After another E.V of ''Jasta'' 19 crashed, ''[[Idflieg]]'' grounded all E.V aircraft. Pending the investigation of these wing failures, production ceased at the Fokker Flugzeugwerke. According to Fokker, the wing failures were caused by the army technical bureau, which had forced him to modify the original design by over-strengthening the [[Spar (aeronautics)|rear main spar]]. This faulty design allegedly caused the wing to twist and fail. Fokker claimed that this defect was resolved by reverting to his original design.\n\nAccording to most other accounts, the source of the wing failures lay not in the design, but in shoddy and rushed construction. Fokker had subcontracted construction of the E.V wings to the Gebr\u00fcder Perzina Pianoforte Fabrik factory. Due to poor quality control, inferior timber had been used and the [[Spar (aeronautics)#Wooden construction|spar caps]], forming the upper and lower members of each spar assembly, had been placed too far apart during the fabrication. Because the resulting spars were vertically too large to pass through the ribs, excess material was simply planed away from the exposed upper and lower surfaces of the cap pieces, leaving the assembled spars dangerously weak. Other problems included water damage to glued parts, and pins that splintered the spars, rather than securing them.<ref>Connors, John F., \"''Fokker's Flying Razors''\", Wings, Granada Hills, California, August 1974, Volume 4, Number 4, pages 45, 48.</ref>\n\nTests showed that, when properly constructed, the original E.V wing had a considerable margin of safety. Satisfied that the basic design was safe, ''[[Idflieg]]'' authorized continued production, after personnel changes and improved quality control measures were introduced  at the Perzina factory.\n\nDeliveries resumed in October. At the direction of the ''Kogenluft'' (''Kommandierenden General der Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte''), ''Idflieg'' redesignated the modified aircraft '''D.VIII'''. The earlier \"E.\" and \"Dr.\" prefixes for fighter monoplanes and triplanes, respectively, were abolished and all fighters would henceforth receive the \"D.\" prefix instead. The D.VIII commenced operations on 24 October with [[Jasta 11|''Jasta'' 11]]. The aircraft proved to be agile and easy to fly.  Allied pilots nicknamed it the ''Flying Razor'', presumably because it resembled a cocked straight razor in flight.\n\n''Jasta'' 5 was issued a D.VIII. The famed ace [[Erich Lowenhardt]] performed a test flight of a Fokker EV whilst paying a visit to Jasta 6 in the summer of 1918, but no evidence of him flying this aircraft on any other occasion exists to date.\n\nA total of 381 aircraft were produced, but only some 85 aircraft reached frontline service before the Armistice. Some reached Italy, Japan, the United States, and England as trophies, but most were scrapped in accordance with the terms of the Armistice.\n\n===Postwar===\nThe [[Polish Air Force]] captured 17 aircraft, but only seven (six E.V and one D.VIII) were in airworthy condition. All were used against Soviet forces in the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919-1920. Lieutenant Stefan Stec earned the first kill for the Polish Air Force, by shooting down a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Nieuport 11]] ''B\u00e9b\u00e9'' fighter on 29 April 1919. In 1921, the remaining Fokkers were withdrawn from front-line units and transferred to the ''Szko\u0142a Obs\u0142ugi Lotniczej'' (Air Personnel School) at [[Port lotniczy Pozna\u0144-\u0141awica|Pozna\u0144-\u0141awica]] airfield.\n\n==Variants==\n* '''V 26''' : Initial prototype.\n* '''V 27''' : V.26 with {{convert|195|hp|kW|abbr=on|0}} [[Benz IIIb]] [[V8 engine]].
