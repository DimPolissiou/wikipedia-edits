In ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land.

With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important [[public health]] issue, and an issue of human [[dignity]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=O'Reilly |first=Kathleen | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-01-01|title=From toilet insecurity to toilet security: creating safe sanitation for women and girls|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Water|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=19\u201324|doi=10.1002/wat2.1122|issn=2049-1948}}</ref> With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health.

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation.<ref name=\"Cavill\">{{cite book |url= http://www.communityledtotalsanitation.org/resource/frontiers-clts-issue-4-sustainability-and-clts-taking-stock |title=Sustainability and CLTS: Taking Stock Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights Issue 4 |last1=Cavill |last2=Chambers |last3=Vernon | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015 |publisher=IDS |isbn=978-1-78118-222-2 |page=18 }}</ref>\n\nThe Indian [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]] has in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of [[fecal-oral transmission]], defined by:\n\n# No visible feces found in the environment or village and\n# Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdws.gov.in/sites/default/files/R_274_1441280478318.pdf|title=Guidelines for ODF Verification|date=2015|publisher=Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation}}</ref>\n\nHere, 'safe technology option' means toilets that contain feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://forum.susana.org/71-behaviour-change-and-user-psychology-issues/13746-definition-of-odf-open-defecation-free-indian-government-publication|title=Definition of ODF \u2013 Open Defecation Free (Indian government publication)|date=2015-06-18|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-gb}}</ref> This definition is part of the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Campaign).\n\n== Reasons ==\n\nThe reasons for open defecation are varied.

Also, older people are often found to defecate in the open and they are hesitant to change their behavior and go inside a closed toilet.<ref name=\"Routray 880\" />\n* Prefer being in nature: This happens mostly in less populated or rural areas, where people walk outside early in the morning and go to defecate in the fields or bushes. They prefer to be in nature and the fresh air; instead of defecating in a closed space such as a toilet.<ref name=\"Ahmad\" /> There may be cultural or habitual preference for defecating \"in the open air\", beside a local river or stream, or even the bush.\n* Combining open defecation with other activities: Some people walk early in the morning to look after their farms. Some consider it as a social activity, especially women who like to take some time to go out of their homes. While on their way to the fields for open defecation they can talk to other women and take care of their animals.<ref name=\"Routray 880\" />\n* [[Norm (social)|Social norms]]: Open defecation is a part of people's life and daily habit in some regions (e.g. in India).

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation.<ref name=\"Cavill\">{{cite book |url= http://www.communityledtotalsanitation.org/resource/frontiers-clts-issue-4-sustainability-and-clts-taking-stock |title=Sustainability and CLTS: Taking Stock Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights Issue 4 |last1=Cavill |last2=Chambers |last3=Vernon | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015 |publisher=IDS |isbn=978-1-78118-222-2 |page=18 }}</ref>\n\nThe Indian [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]] has in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of [[fecal-oral transmission]], defined by:\n\n# No visible feces found in the environment or village and\n# Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdws.gov.in/sites/default/files/R_274_1441280478318.pdf|title=Guidelines for ODF Verification|date=2015|publisher=Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation}}</ref>\n\nHere, 'safe technology option' means toilets that contain feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://forum.susana.org/71-behaviour-change-and-user-psychology-issues/13746-definition-of-odf-open-defecation-free-indian-government-publication|title=Definition of ODF \u2013 Open Defecation Free (Indian government publication)|date=2015-06-18|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-gb}}</ref> This definition is part of the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Campaign).\n\n== Reasons ==\n\nThe reasons for open defecation are varied.

His playing time there was limited, so to gain first-team experience Liverpool loaned him out to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] and then to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. In 2009, he signed permanently with the latter and went on to make more than 100 appearances in the three seasons he spent with the club. After a stint with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] between 2011 and 2014, where he was also the [[captain (association football)|club captain]] for the [[2011\u201312 Hull City A.F.C. season|2011\u201312]] season, he joined Nottingham Forest. Though initially on loan, he later penned a two-year deal. His stint at the club was hampered by persistent injuries.\n\nHobbs has also been capped at the national youth level and made three appearances for [[England national under-19 football team|England U19]] in 2007.\n\n==Early life==\nThough Hobbs was born in [[Portsmouth]], Hampshire, he moved to the village of [[Moulton, Lincolnshire]] during his youth.

In 2009, he signed permanently with the latter and went on to make more than 100 appearances in the three seasons he spent with the club.

Part of the record-breaking [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], which included three of the  ten [[List of the most intense tropical cyclones#North Atlantic Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricanes]] ever (along with #4 [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and #7 [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]), Wilma was the twenty-second storm, thirteenth [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]], sixth [[major hurricane]], fourth [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] hurricane, and the second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 [[Atlantic hurricane season|season]]. A [[tropical depression]] formed in the [[Caribbean Sea]] near [[Jamaica]] on October 15, headed westward, and intensified into a [[tropical storm]] two days later, which abruptly turned southward and was named ''Wilma''. Wilma continued to strengthen, and eventually became a hurricane on October 18. Shortly thereafter, [[Rapid intensification|explosive intensification]] occurred, and in only 24 hours, Wilma became a Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of {{convert|185|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nWilma's intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a Category 5 hurricane, and winds had decreased to {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} before it reached the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] on October 20 and 21. After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n, Wilma emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as a Category 2 hurricane. As it began accelerating to the northeast, gradual re-intensification occurred, and the hurricane was upgraded to Category 3 status on October 24. Shortly thereafter, Wilma made landfall in [[Cape Romano]], [[Florida]] with winds of {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. As Wilma was crossing Florida, it briefly weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane, but again re-intensified as it reached the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane intensified into a Category 3 hurricane for the last time, before weakening while accelerating northeastward. By October 26, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] southeast of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nWilma made several landfalls, with the most destructive effects felt in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]], and the U.S. state of Florida. At least 62 deaths were reported and damage totaled to $27.4 billion, of which $19 billion occurred in the United States.<ref name=\"tcr\">{{cite web|author1=Richard J. Pasch |author2=Eric S.

During this time, [[Atlantic hurricane season|major Atlantic hurricanes]] occurred slightly more frequently than average; they just did not make landfall in the United States.  Also, after Wilma, no hurricane struck the state of Florida until [[Hurricane Hermine]] did so nearly 11 years later in 2016, and no major hurricane struck Florida until nearly 12 years later when [[Hurricane Irma]] made landfall in early September 2017.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma}}\n{{storm path|Wilma 2005 track.png}}\nDuring mid-October 2005, a large [[monsoon trough|monsoon-like]] system developed in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. A broad [[low pressure area]] formed on October&nbsp;13 to the southeast of Jamaica, which slowly became more defined. On October&nbsp;15, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while located about {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Grand Cayman]]. Steered by two [[ridge (meteorology)|ridges]] to its north, the depression drifted southwestward through a favorable environment, with warm [[sea surface temperature]]s. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on October&nbsp;17, whereupon the NHC [[tropical cyclone naming|named]] it ''Wilma''. Initial intensification was slow, due to Wilma's large size and a flat [[pressure gradient]], although the associated [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] gradually organized.<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\nOn October&nbsp;18, Wilma intensified into a hurricane, and subsequently underwent [[rapid deepening|explosive deepening]] over the open waters of the Caribbean Sea. In a 30&ndash;period through October&nbsp;19, Wilma's [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] dropped from 982&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.00&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) to 882&nbsp;mbar (26.05&nbsp;inHg); this made Wilma the [[List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones#North_Atlantic_Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricane on record]], based on pressure. During the same intensification period, the winds increased to a peak intensity of 185&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h), making Wilma a Category&nbsp;5 on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]]. An [[eyewall replacement cycle]] caused Wilma to weaken below Category&nbsp;5 status on October&nbsp;20, as it drifted northwestward toward Mexico's [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Late on October&nbsp;21, Wilma made landfall on the island of [[Cozumel]], [[Quintana Roo]], with sustained winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). About six hours later, Wilma made a second landfall on the Mexican mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n{{Most intense hurricanes|align=right}}\nThe hurricane weakened over land, but re-intensified once it reached the Gulf of Mexico. Wilma accelerated to the northeast, steered by a powerful [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. After passing northwest of the [[Florida Keys]], the hurricane struck southwestern Florida near [[Cape Romano]] on October&nbsp;24 with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). Wilma rapidly crossed the state and weakened, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Jupiter, Florida]]. The hurricane briefly re-intensified while passing north of the Bahamas, absorbing the smaller [[Tropical Storm Alpha (2005)|Tropical Storm Alpha]] to the east. The hurricane passed west of [[Bermuda]] on October&nbsp;25. After cold air and wind shear penetrated the core of convection, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October&nbsp;26 to the south of Nova Scotia; it was absorbed by another extratropical storm a day later over [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n===Records===\nAt 18:01&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;19, a [[Hurricane Hunters]] [[dropsonde]] measured a barometric pressure of {{convert|884|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} in the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of Wilma, along with sustained winds of 23&nbsp;mph (46&nbsp;km/h); the wind value suggested that the central pressure was slightly lower, estimated at {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.

Part of the record-breaking [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], which included three of the  ten [[List of the most intense tropical cyclones#North Atlantic Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricanes]] ever (along with #4 [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and #7 [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]), Wilma was the twenty-second storm, thirteenth [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]], sixth [[major hurricane]], fourth [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] hurricane, and the second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 [[Atlantic hurricane season|season]]. A [[tropical depression]] formed in the [[Caribbean Sea]] near [[Jamaica]] on October 15, headed westward, and intensified into a [[tropical storm]] two days later, which abruptly turned southward and was named ''Wilma''. Wilma continued to strengthen, and eventually became a hurricane on October 18. Shortly thereafter, [[Rapid intensification|explosive intensification]] occurred, and in only 24 hours, Wilma became a Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of {{convert|185|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nWilma's intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a Category 5 hurricane, and winds had decreased to {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} before it reached the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] on October 20 and 21. After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n, Wilma emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as a Category 2 hurricane. As it began accelerating to the northeast, gradual re-intensification occurred, and the hurricane was upgraded to Category 3 status on October 24. Shortly thereafter, Wilma made landfall in [[Cape Romano]], [[Florida]] with winds of {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. As Wilma was crossing Florida, it briefly weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane, but again re-intensified as it reached the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane intensified into a Category 3 hurricane for the last time, before weakening while accelerating northeastward. By October 26, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] southeast of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nWilma made several landfalls, with the most destructive effects felt in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]], and the U.S. state of Florida. At least 62 deaths were reported and damage totaled to $27.4 billion, of which $19 billion occurred in the United States.<ref name=\"tcr\">{{cite web|author1=Richard J. Pasch |author2=Eric S.

During this time, [[Atlantic hurricane season|major Atlantic hurricanes]] occurred slightly more frequently than average; they just did not make landfall in the United States.  Also, after Wilma, no hurricane struck the state of Florida until [[Hurricane Hermine]] did so nearly 11 years later in 2016, and no major hurricane struck Florida until nearly 12 years later when [[Hurricane Irma]] made landfall in early September 2017.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma}}\n{{storm path|Wilma 2005 track.png}}\nDuring mid-October 2005, a large [[monsoon trough|monsoon-like]] system developed in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. A broad [[low pressure area]] formed on October&nbsp;13 to the southeast of Jamaica, which slowly became more defined. On October&nbsp;15, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while located about {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Grand Cayman]]. Steered by two [[ridge (meteorology)|ridges]] to its north, the depression drifted southwestward through a favorable environment, with warm [[sea surface temperature]]s. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on October&nbsp;17, whereupon the NHC [[tropical cyclone naming|named]] it ''Wilma''. Initial intensification was slow, due to Wilma's large size and a flat [[pressure gradient]], although the associated [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] gradually organized.<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\nOn October&nbsp;18, Wilma intensified into a hurricane, and subsequently underwent [[rapid deepening|explosive deepening]] over the open waters of the Caribbean Sea. In a 30&ndash;period through October&nbsp;19, Wilma's [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] dropped from 982&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.00&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) to 882&nbsp;mbar (26.05&nbsp;inHg); this made Wilma the [[List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones#North_Atlantic_Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricane on record]], based on pressure. During the same intensification period, the winds increased to a peak intensity of 185&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h), making Wilma a Category&nbsp;5 on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]]. An [[eyewall replacement cycle]] caused Wilma to weaken below Category&nbsp;5 status on October&nbsp;20, as it drifted northwestward toward Mexico's [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Late on October&nbsp;21, Wilma made landfall on the island of [[Cozumel]], [[Quintana Roo]], with sustained winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). About six hours later, Wilma made a second landfall on the Mexican mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n{{Most intense hurricanes|align=right}}\nThe hurricane weakened over land, but re-intensified once it reached the Gulf of Mexico. Wilma accelerated to the northeast, steered by a powerful [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. After passing northwest of the [[Florida Keys]], the hurricane struck southwestern Florida near [[Cape Romano]] on October&nbsp;24 with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). Wilma rapidly crossed the state and weakened, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Jupiter, Florida]]. The hurricane briefly re-intensified while passing north of the Bahamas, absorbing the smaller [[Tropical Storm Alpha (2005)|Tropical Storm Alpha]] to the east. The hurricane passed west of [[Bermuda]] on October&nbsp;25. After cold air and wind shear penetrated the core of convection, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October&nbsp;26 to the south of Nova Scotia; it was absorbed by another extratropical storm a day later over [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n===Records===\nAt 18:01&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;19, a [[Hurricane Hunters]] [[dropsonde]] measured a barometric pressure of {{convert|884|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} in the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of Wilma, along with sustained winds of 23&nbsp;mph (46&nbsp;km/h); the wind value suggested that the central pressure was slightly lower, estimated at {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.

Citrus production estimates fell to a low of 158&nbsp;million boxes for the 2005\u20132006 production seasons from a high of 240&nbsp;million for 2003\u20132004.<ref name=\"fl_citrus\">{{cite web |last=Bouffard |first=Kevin |url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060319/NEWS/603190372/1001/BUSINESS |title=1\u20132 Punch Hits Citrus |publisher=Theledger.com |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223755/http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060319%2FNEWS%2F603190372%2F1001%2FBUSINESS |archive-date=December 2, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2006, artists were invited to exhibit sculptures inspired by the storm in an outdoor exhibit at [[Fort Zachary Taylor]] near the new NWS hurricane and weather forecasting center in Key West, Florida.\n\nBy late-September 2010, roughly $9.2&nbsp;billion had been paid for more than 1&nbsp;million insurance claims that had been filed throughout Florida in relation to Hurricane Wilma.<ref>{{cite web|author=Julie Patel|publisher=Sun Sentinel|date=September 28, 2010|accessdate=October 14, 2010|title=Deadline for Hurricane Wilma claims approaching|url=http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/business/realestate/housekeys/blog/2010/09/deadline_for_hurricane_wilma_c.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018194438/http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/business/realestate/housekeys/blog/2010/09/deadline_for_hurricane_wilma_c.html|archive-date=October 18, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Mexico===\nThe popular Mexican resort towns of [[Playa del Carmen]], [[Cozumel]], and [[Canc\u00fan]] all suffered significant damage from Wilma, causing a major loss of tourism income.
