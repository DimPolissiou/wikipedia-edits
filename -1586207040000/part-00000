Each team plays the other 7 teams in their stream 3 times, for a total of 21 games. Teams receive 3 points for a win, 1 for draw, and 0 for a loss. At the end of the season, the top ranked team from each stream play in a two-legged final, the winner of which is crowned National First Division Champion, and gains automatic promotion to the Premier Soccer League for the next season. The loser of the final, along with the teams which came second in their streams, and the 15th placed PSL team, go into the PSL promotion play-offs.

At the end of the season, the top ranked team from each stream play in a two-legged final, the winner of which is crowned National First Division Champion, and gains automatic promotion to the Premier Soccer League for the next season. The loser of the final, along with the teams which came second in their streams, and the 15th placed PSL team, go into the PSL promotion play-offs. The two teams finishing in last place in their streams are automatically relegated to the Vodacom League.

(2011). What is Psychological Assessment?. Psych Central. Retrieved on 11 November 2013, from http://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-psychological-assessment/0005890</ref> A common reason for a psychological evaluation is to identify psychological factors that may be inhibiting a person's ability to think, behave, or regulate emotion functionally or constructively. It is the [[mind|mental]] equivalent of [[physical examination]]. Other psychological evaluations seek to better understand the individual's unique characteristics or personality to predict things like [[Employment testing|workplace performance]] or [[customer relationship management]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Individual differences and personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael C.|date=2013|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780124160095|edition= 2nd |location=Amsterdam|oclc=835227535}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nModern ''Psychological evaluation'' has been around for roughly 200 years, with roots that stem as far back as 2200 B.C.<ref name=\"Gregory2010\">Gregory, R. J. (2010). Psychological testing: history, principles, and applications. (7th ed., pp. 1-29 inclusive). Boston, MA: Allyn & Bacon.</ref> It started in China, and many psychologists throughout Europe worked to develop methods of testing into the 1900s. The first tests focused on aptitude. Eventually scientists tried to gauge mental processes in patients with brain damage, then children with special needs.\n\n=== Ancient psychological evaluation ===\nEarliest accounts of evaluation are seen as far back as 2200 B.C. when Chinese emperors were assessed to determine their fitness for office. These rudimentary tests were developed over time until 1370 A.D. when an understanding of classical [[Confucianism]] was introduced as a testing mechanism. As a preliminary evaluation for anyone seeking public office, candidates were required to spend one day and one night in a small space composing essays and writing poetry over assigned topics. Only the top 1% to 7% were selected for higher evaluations, which required three separate session of three days and three nights performing the same tasks. This process continued for one more round until a final group emerged, comprising less than 1% of the original group, became eligible for public office. The Chinese failure to validate their selection procedures, along with widespread discontent over such grueling processes, resulted in the eventual abolishment of the practice by royal decree.<ref name=\"Gregory2010\" />\n\n=== Modern psychological evaluation ===\nIn the 1800s, [[Hubert von Grashey]] developed a battery to determine the abilities of brain-damaged patients. This test was also not favorable, as it took over 100 hours to administer. However, this influenced [[Wilhelm Wundt]], who had the first psychological laboratory in Germany. His tests were shorter, but used similar techniques. Wundt also measured mental processes and acknowledged the fact that there are individual differences between people.\n\nFrances Galton established the first tests in London for measuring [[IQ]]. He tested thousands of people, examining their physical characteristics as a basis for his results and many of the records remain today.<ref name=Gregory2010/> [[James Cattell]] studied with him, and eventually worked on his own with brass instruments for evaluation. His studies led to his paper \"Mental Tests and Measurements\" ,one of the most famous writings on psychological evaluation. He also coined the term \"''mental test''\" in this paper.\n\nAs the 1900s began, [[Alfred Binet]] was also studying evaluation. However, he was more interested in distinguishing children with special needs from their peers after he could not prove in his other research that magnets could cure [[hysteria]]. He did his research in France, with the help of [[Theodore Simon]]. They created a list of questions that were used to determine if children would receive regular instruction, or would participate in special education programs. Their battery was continually revised and developed, until 1911 when the ''Binet-Simon questionnaire'' was finalized for different age levels.\n\nAfter Binet's death, intelligence testing was further studied by [[Charles Spearman]]. He theorized that intelligence was made up of several different subcategories, which were all interrelated. He combined all the factors together to form a general intelligence, which he abbreviated as \"g\".<ref name=Fancher2012>Fancher, R., & Rutherford, A. (2012). Pioneers of psychology. (4th ed., pp. 563-601 inclusive). New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.</ref> This led to [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]]'s idea of an intelligence quotient. He believed that children of different ages should be compared to their peers to determine their mental age in relation to their chronological age. [[Lewis Terman]] combined the Binet-Simon questionnaire with the intelligence quotient and the result was the standard test we use today, with an average score of 100.<ref name=Fancher2012/>\n\nThe large influx of non-English speaking immigrants into the US brought about a change in psychological testing that relied heavily on verbal skills for subjects that were not literate in English, or had speech/hearing difficulties. In 1913, R.H. Sylvester standardized the first non-verbal psychological test. In this particular test, participants fit different shaped blocks into their respective slots on a Seguin form board.<ref name =Gregory2010/> From this test, Knox developed a series of non-verbal psychological tests that he used while working at the Ellis Island immigrant station in 1914. In his tests, were a simple wooden puzzle as well as digit-symbol substitution test where each participant saw digits paired up with a particular symbol, they were then shown the digits and had to write in the symbol that was associated with it.<ref name=Gregory2010/>\n\nWhen the United States moved into World War I, [[Robert M. Yerkes]] convinced the government that they should be testing all of the recruits they were receiving into the Army. The results of the tests could be used to make sure that the \"''mentally incompetent''\" and \"''mentally exceptional''\" were assigned to appropriate jobs. Yerkes and his colleagues developed the [[Army Alpha]] and [[Army Beta]] tests to use on all new recruits.<ref name=Gregory2010/> These tests set a precedent for the development of psychological testing for the next several decades.\n\nAfter seeing the success of the Army standardized tests, college administration quickly picked up on the idea of group testing to decide entrance into their institutions. The [[College Entrance Examination Board]] was created to test applicants to colleges across the nation. In 1925, they developed tests that were no longer essay tests that were very open to interpretation, but now were objective tests that were also the first to be scored by machine. These early tests evolved into modern day College Board tests, like the ''Scholastic Assessment Test'', ''Graduate Record Examination'', and the ''Law School Admissions Test''.<ref name=Gregory2010/>\n\n==Formal and informal evaluation==\nFormal psychological evaluation consists of standardized batteries of tests and highly structured clinician-run interviews, while informal evaluation takes on a completely different tone. In informal evaluation, assessments are based on ''unstructured, free-flowing interviews'' or ''observations'' that allow both the patient and the clinician to guide the content. Both of these methods have their pros and cons. A highly unstructured interview and informal observations provide key findings about the patient that are both efficient and effective. A potential issue with an unstructured, informal approach is the clinician may overlook certain areas of functioning or not notice them at all.<ref name=Meyer2001>Meyer, G., Finn, S., & Eyde, L. (2001). Psychological testing and psychological assessment. American Psychologist, 56(2), 128-165.</ref> Or they might focus too much on presenting complaints. The highly structured interview, although very precise, can cause the clinician to make the mistake of focusing a specific answer to a specific question without considering the response in terms of a broader scope or life context.<ref name=Meyer2001/> They may fail to recognize how the patient's answers all fit together.\n\nThere are many ways that the issues associated with the interview process can be mitigated. The benefits to more formal standardized evaluation types such as batteries and tests are many. First, they measure a large number of characteristics simultaneously. These include personality, cognitive, or neuropsychological characteristics. Second, these tests provide empirically quantified information. The obvious benefit to this is that we can more precisely measure patient characteristics as compared to any kind of structured or unstructured interview. Third, all of these tests have a standardized way of being scored and being administered.<ref name=Meyer2001/> Each patient is presented a standardized stimulus that serves as a benchmark that can be used to determine their characteristics. These types of tests eliminate any possibility of bias and produce results that could be harmful to the patient and cause legal and ethical issues. Fourth, tests are ''normed''. This means that patients can be assessed not only based on their comparison to a \"normal\" individual, but how they compare to the rest of their peers who may have the same psychological issues that they face. Normed tests allow the clinician to make a more individualized assessment of the patient. Fifth, standardized tests that we commonly use today are both valid and reliable.<ref name=Meyer2001/> We know what specific scores mean, how reliable they are, and how the results will affect the patient.\n\nMost clinicians agree that a balanced battery of tests is the most effective way of helping patients. Clinicians should not become victims of blind adherence to any one particular method.<ref name=Fernandez2003>Fernandez-Ballesteros, R. (2003). Encyclopedia of psychological assessment. (Vol. 1, pp. 173-175). London: Sage Publications.</ref>  A balanced battery of tests allows there to be a mix of formal testing processes that allow the clinician to start making their assessment, while conducting more informal, unstructured interviews with the same patient may help the clinician to make more individualized evaluations and help piece together what could potentially be a very complex, unique-to-the-individual kind of issue or problem .<ref name=Fernandez2003/>\n\n==Modern uses==\nPsychological assessment is most often used in the ''psychiatric, medical, legal, educational, or psychological clinic settings''.  The types of assessments and the purposes for them differ among these settings.\n\nIn the [[psychiatric]] setting, the common needs for assessment are to determine risks, whether a person should be admitted or discharged, the location the patients should be held, as well as what therapy the patient should be receiving.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003>Groth-Marnat, G. (2003). ''Handbook of Psychological Assessment.'' Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons.</ref> Within this setting, the psychologists need to be aware of the legal responsibilities that what they can legally do in each situation.\n\nWithin a medical setting, psychological assessment is used to find a possible underlying psychological disorder, emotional factors that may be associated with medical complaints, assessment for neuropsychological deficit, psychological treatment for chronic pain, and the treatment of [[chemical dependency]]. There has been greater importance placed on the patient\u2019s neuropsychological status as neuropsychologists are becoming more concerned with the functioning of the brain.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nPsychological assessment also has a role in the legal setting. Psychologists might be asked to assess the reliability of a witness, the quality of the testimony a witness gives, the competency of an accused person, or determine what might have happened during a crime. They also may help support a plea of insanity or to discount a plea. Judges may use the psychologist's report to change the sentence of a convicted person, and parole officers work with psychologists to create a program for the rehabilitation of a parolee. Problematic areas for psychologists include predicting how dangerous a person will be. There are currently no accurate measure for this prediction, however there is often a need for this prediction to prevent dangerous people from returning to society.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nPsychologists may also be called on to assess a variety of things within an education setting. They may be asked to assess strengths and weaknesses of children who are having difficulty in the school systems, assess behavioral difficulties, assess a child\u2019s responsiveness to an intervention, or to help create an educational plan for a child. The assessment of children also allows for the psychologists to determine if the child will be willing to use the resources that may be provided.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nIn a psychological clinic setting, psychological assessment can be used to determine characteristics of the client that can be useful for developing a treatment plan. Within this setting, psychologists often are working with clients who may have medical or legal problems or sometimes students who were referred to this setting from their school psychologist.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nSome psychological assessments have been validated for use when administered via computer or the Internet.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Briones\n| first = Elizabeth M.\n| last2 = Benham\n| first2 = Grant\n| date = 2016-02-23\n| title = An examination of the equivalency of self-report measures obtained from crowdsourced versus undergraduate student samples\n| journal = Behavior Research Methods\n| volume = 49\n| issue = 1\n| language = en\n| pages = 320\u2013334\n| doi = 10.3758/s13428-016-0710-8\n| pmid = 26907746\n| issn = 1554-3528\n}}</ref> However, caution must be applied to these test results, as it is possible to fake in electronically mediated assessment.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Grieve\n| first = Rachel\n| last2 = Elliott\n| first2 = Jade\n| date = 2013-04-10\n| title = Cyberfaking: I Can, So I Will?

This means that it was not developed using any of the frequently changing theories about psychodynamics at the time. There are two variations of the MMPI administered to adults, the MMPI-2 and the MMPI-2-RF, and two variations administered to teenagers, the MMPI-A and MMPI-A-RF.

McCrae in 1978. When initially created, it only measured three of the Big Five personality traits: Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, and Extroversion. The inventory was then renamed as the Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Inventory (NEO-I). It was not until 1985 that Agreeableness and Conscientiousness were added to the personality assessment. With all Big Five personality traits being assessed, it was then renamed as the NEO Personality Inventory. Research for the NEO-PI continued over the next few years until a revised manual with six facets for each Big Five trait was published in 1992.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\"/> In the 1990s, now called the NEO PI-R, issues were found with the personality inventory. The developers of the assessment found it to be too difficult for younger people, and another revision was done to create the NEO PI-3.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Costa|first=P.

It consists of 240 personality items and a validity item. It can be administered in roughly 35\u201345 minutes. Every item is answered on a Likert scale, widely known as a scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. If more than 40 items are missing or more than 150 responses or less than 50 responses are Strongly Agree/Disagree, the assessment should be viewed with great caution and has the potential to be invalid.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sigmaassessmentsystems.com/assessments/neo-personality-inventory-3/|title=NEO Personality Inventory-3 {{!}} SIGMA|work=SIGMA Assessment Systems|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}</ref> In the NEO report, each trait's T score is recorded along with the percentile they rank on compared to all data recorded for the assessment. Then, each trait is broken up into their six facets along with raw score, individual T-scores, and percentile. The next page goes on to list what each score means in words as well as what each facet entails. The exact responses to questions are given in a list as well as the validity response and amount of missing responses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sigmaassessmentsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NEO-PI-3-BRC-Sample-Report.pdf|title=NEO-PI-3 Sample Report|date=2010|website=Sigma Assessment Systems|access-date=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen an individual is given their NEO report, it is important to understand specifically what the facets are and what the corresponding scores mean. \n{{colbegin|colwidth=}}\n* Neuroticism \n** Anxiety \n*** High scores suggest nervousness, tenseness, and fearfulness. Low scores suggest feeling relaxed and calm. \n** Angry Hostility \n*** High scores suggest feeling anger and frustration often. Low scores suggest being easy-going.\n** Depression \n*** High scores suggest feeling guilty, sad, hopeless, and lonely. Low scores suggest less feeling of that of someone who scores highly, but not necessarily being light-hearted and cheerful. \n** Self-Consciousness \n*** High scores suggest shame, embarrassment, and sensitivity. Low scores suggest being less affected by others' opinions, but not necessarily having good social skills or poise.\n** Impulsiveness\n*** High scores suggest the inability to control cravings and urges. Low scores suggest easy resistance to such urges.\n** Vulnerability \n*** High scores suggest inability to cope with stress, being dependent, and feeling panicked in high stress situations. Low scores suggest capability to handle stressful situations.\n* Extraversion\n** Warmth\n*** High scores suggest friendliness and affectionate behavior. Low scores suggest being more formal, reserved, and distant. A low score does not necessarily mean being hostile or lacking compassion.\n** Gregariousness\n*** High scores suggest wanting the company of others. Low scores tend to be from those who avoid social stimulation.\n** Assertiveness\n*** High scores suggest a forceful and dominant person who lacks hesitation. Low scores suggest are more passive and try not to stand out in a crowd.\n** Activity\n*** High scores suggest a more energetic and upbeat personality and lead a quicker paced lifestyle. Low scores suggest the person is more leisurely, but does not imply being lazy or slow. \n** Excitement-Seeking\n*** High scores suggest a person who seeks and craves excitement and is similar to those with high sensation seeking. Low scores seek a less exciting lifestyle and come off more boring. \n** Positive Emotions\n*** High scores suggest the tendency to feel happier, laugh more, and are optimistic. Low scorers are not necessarily unhappy, but more so are less high-spirited and are more pessimistic.\n{{colend}}\n{{colbegin}}\n* Openness to Experience\n** Fantasy\n*** Those who score high in fantasy have a more creative imagination and daydream frequently. Low scores suggest a person who lives more in the moment. \n** Aesthetics\n*** High scores suggest a love and appreciation for art and physical beauty. These people are more emotionally attached to music, artwork, and poetry. Low scorers have a lack of interest in the arts. \n** Feelings\n*** High scorers have a deeper ability to experience emotion and see their emotions as more important than those who score low on this facet. Low scorers are less expressive.\n** Actions\n*** High scores suggest a more open-mindedness to traveling and experiencing new things. These people prefer novelty over a routine life. Low scorers prefer a scheduled life and dislike change.\n** Ideas\n*** Active pursuit of knowledge, high curiosity, and the enjoyment of brain teasers and philosophical are common of those who score high on this facet. Those who score lower are not necessarily less intelligent, nor does a high score imply high intelligence. However, those who score lower are more narrow in their interests and have low curiosity. \n** Values\n*** High scorers are more investigative of political, social, and religious values. Those who score lower and more accepting of authority and honor more traditional values. High scorers are more typically liberal while lower scorers are more typically conservative.  \n* Agreeableness\n** Trust\n*** High scores are more trusting of others and believe others are honest and have good intentions. Low scorers are more skeptical, cynical, and assumes others are dishonest and/or dangerous.\n** Straightforwardness\n*** Those who score high in this facet are more sincere and frank. Low scorers are more deceitful and more willing to manipulate others, but this does not mean they should be labeled as a dishonest or manipulative person. \n** Altruism\n*** High scores suggest a person concerned with the well-being of others and show it through generosity, willingness to help others, and volunteering for those less fortunate. Low scores suggest a more self-centered person who is less willing to go out of their way to help others.\n** Compliance\n*** High scorers are more inclined to avoid conflict and tend to forgive easily. Low scores suggest a more aggressive personality and a love for competition.\n** Modesty\n*** High scorers are more humble, but not necessarily lacking in self-esteem or confidence. Low scorers believe they're more superior than others and may come off as more conceited.\n** Tender-Mindedness\n*** This facet scales one's concern for others and their ability to empathize. High scorers are more moved by others' emotions, while low scorers are more hardheaded and typically consider themselves realists. \n{{colend}}\n* Conscientiousness\n** Competence\n*** High scores suggest one is capable, sensible, prudent, effective, and are well-prepared to deal with whatever happens in life. Low scores suggest a potential lower self-esteem and are often unprepared. \n** Order\n*** High scorers are more neat and tidy, while low scorers lack organization and are unmethodical.\n** Dutifulness\n*** Those who score highly in this facet are more strict about their ethical principles and are more dependable. Low scorers are less reliable and are more casual about their morals.\n** Achievement Striving\n*** Those who score highly in this facet have higher aspirations and work harder to achieve their goals. However, they may be too invested in their work and become a workaholic. Low scorers are much less ambitious and perhaps even lazy. They are often content with their lack of goal-seeking.\n** Self-Discipline\n*** High scorers complete whatever task is assigned to them and are self-motivated. Low scorers often procrastinate and are easily discouraged.\n** Deliberation\n*** High scorers tend to think more than low scorers before acting. High scorers are more cautious and deliberate while low scorers are more hasty and act without considering the consequences.\n\n=== HEXACO-PI ===\nThe [[HEXACO model of personality structure|HEXACO]]-PI, developed by Lee and Ashton in the early 2000s, is a personality inventory used to measure six different dimensions of personality which have been found in lexical studies across various cultures. There are two versions of the HEXACO: the HEXACO-PI and the HEXACO-PI-R which are examined with either self reports or observer reports. The HEXACO-PI-R has forms of three lengths: 200 items, 100 items, and 60 items. Items from each form are grouped to measure scales of more narrow personality traits, which are them grouped into broad  scales of the six dimensions: honesty & humility (H), emotionality (E), Extraversion (X), agreeableness (A), conscientiousness (C), and openness to experience (O).The HEXACO-PI-R includes various traits associated with neuroticism and can be used to help identify trait tendencies. One table which give examples of typically high loaded adjectives on the six factors of HEXACO can be found in Ashton's book \"Individual Differences and Personality\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Adjective relating to the six factors within the HEXACO structure\n!Personality Factor\n!Narrow Personality Traits\n!Related Adjectives\n|-\n|Honesty-Humility\n|Sincerity, fairness, greed-avoidance, modesty\n|Sincere, honest, faithful/loyal, modest/unassuming, fair-minded versus sly, deceitful, greedy, pretentious, hypocritical, boastful, pompous\n|-\n|Emotionality\n|Fearfulness, anxiety, depenence, sentimentality\n|Emotional, oversensitive, sentrimental, fearful, anxious, vulnerable versus brave, tough, independenct, self-assured, stable\n|-\n|Extraversion\n|Social self-esteem, social boldness, sociability, liveliness\n|Outgoing, lively, extraverted, sociable, talkative, cheerful, active versus shy, passive, withdrawn, introverted, quiet, reserved \n|-\n|Agreeableness\n|Forgivingness, gentleness, flexibility, patience\n|Patient, tolerant, peaceful, mild, agreeable, lenient, gentle versus ill-tempered, quarelsome, stubborn, choleric\n|-\n|Conscientiousness\n|Organization, diligence, perfectionism, prudence\n|Organized, disciplined, diligent, careful, thorough, precise verus sloppy, negligent, reckless, lazy, irresponsible, absent-minded\n|-\n|Openess to Experience\n|Aesthetic appreciation, inquisitiveness, creativity, unconventionality\n|Intellectual, creative, unconventional, innovative, ironic versus shallow, unimaginative, conventional\n|}\nOne benefit of using the HEXACO is that of the facet of neurotocism within the factor of emotionality: trait neurotocism has been shown to have a moderate positive correlation with people with anxiety and depression. The identification of trait neuroticism on a scale, paired with anxiety, and/or depression is beneficial in a clinical setting for introductory screenings some personality disorders. Because the HEXACO has facets which help identify traits of neuroticism, it is also a helpful indicator of the dark triad.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Joshua D.|last2=Lynam|first2=Donald R.|date=2015-03-01|title=Using Self- and Informant Reports in the Assessment of Personality Pathology in Clinical Settings\u2014An Easy and Effective 1\u20132 Combination|journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=20\u201324|doi=10.1111/cpsp.12090|issn=1468-2850}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.skums.ac.ir/3943/|title=The efficacy of emotionality factor of HEXACO-PI-R on screening of depressive and anxiety disorder (mixed) in university students|last=H.|first=Palahang|last2=M.|first2=Nikfarjam|date=2011|website=eprints.skums.ac.ir|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16|last3=A.|first3=Salahian}}</ref>\n\n==Pseudopsychology (pop psychology) in assessment==\nAlthough there have been many great advancements in the field of psychological evaluation, some issues have also developed.  One of the main problems in the field is ''pseudopsychology'', also called [[pop psychology]].  Psychological evaluation is one of the biggest aspects in pop psychology.  In a clinical setting, patients are not aware that they are not receiving correct psychological treatment, and that belief is one of the main foundations of pseudopsychology.  It is largely based upon the testimonies of previous patients, the avoidance of peer review (a critical aspect of any science), and poorly set up tests, which can include confusing language or conditions that are left up to interpretation.<ref name=Lilienfeld2003>Lilienfeld, S., Lynn, S., & Lohr, J. (2003). ''Science and pseudoscience in clinical psychology.'' (1st ed., pp. 1-25 inclusive). New York, NY: The Guilford Press.</ref>\n\nPseudopsychology can also occur when people claim to be psychologists, but really lack qualifications.<ref name=Burt1948>Burtt, Harold Ernest, (1948). ''Applied psychology'', (pp. 38-63). New York, NY, US: Prentice-Hall, Inc, x, 821 pp.</ref>  A prime example of this is found in quizzes that can lead to a variety of false conclusions.  These can be found in magazines, online, or just about anywhere accessible to the public.  They usually consist of a small number of questions designed to tell the participant things about themselves.  The problem is, they\u2019re usually written by people who know nothing about psychological assessment, and have no research or evidence to back up any diagnosis made by the quizzes.<ref name=Burt1948/> These types of things can tarnish the reputation for true psychological assessment.\n\n==Ethics==\nConcerns about privacy, cultural biases, tests that have not been validated, and inappropriate contexts have led groups such as the [[American Educational Research Association]] (AERA) and the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) to publish guidelines for examiners in regards to assessment.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/> The American Psychological Association states that a client must give permission to release any of the information that may come from a psychologist.<ref name=APA2010 >{{cite web | publisher=American Psychological Association | year=2010 | title=Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct | url=https://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index | accessdate=6 February 2020 }} (Amended to 1 January 2017)</ref> The only exceptions to this are in the case of minors, when the clients are a danger to themselves or others, or if they are applying for a job that requires this information. Also, the issue of privacy occurs during the assessment itself. The client has the right to say as much or little as they would like, however they may feel the need to say more than they want or even may accidentally reveal information they would like to keep private.<ref name= Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nGuidelines have been put in place to ensure the psychologist giving the assessments maintains a professional relationship with the client since their relationship can impact the outcomes of the assessment. The examiner's expectations may also influence the client\u2019s performance in the assessments.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nThe validity and reliability of the tests being used also can affect the outcomes of the assessments being used. When psychologists are choosing which assessments they are going to use, they should pick one that will be most effective for what they are looking at. Also, it is important for the psychologists are aware of the possibility of the client, either consciously or unconsciously, faking answers and consider use of tests that have [[validity scale]]s within them.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Psychoanalysis]]\n* Corresponding evaluations in related fields\n** [[Neurological examination]] in [[neurology]]\n** [[Mental state examination]] in [[psychiatry]]\n** [[Physical examination]] in [[medicine]]\n* [[Therapeutic assessment]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last1=Anastasi |first1=Anne |last2=Urbina |first2=Susana |authorlink1=Anne Anastasi |authorlink2=Susana Urbina |title=Psychological Testing |edition= Seventh |location=Upper Saddle River (NJ) |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |isbn=978-0-02-303085-7 |year=1997 |lay-url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Psychological-Testing-7E/9780023030857.page |laydate=28 July 2010 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite book |title=Comprehensive Handbook of Psychological Assessment: Volume I: Intellectual and Neurological Assessment |editor1-last=Goldstein |editor1-first=Gerald |editor2-last=Beers |editor2-first=Susan  |year=2004 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken (NJ) |isbn=978-0-471-41611-1 |lay-url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471416118,descCd-tableOfContents.html |laydate=23 November 2010 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite book |title=Psychological Testing: History, Principles, and Applications |last=Gregory |first=Robert J. |year=2011 |edition= Sixth |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-78214-7 |lay-url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/bookseller/product/Psychological-Testing-History-Principles-and-Applications-6E/9780205782147.page |laydate=7 November 2010 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite book |title=Handbook of Psychological Assessment |last=Groth-Marnat |first=Gary |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken (NJ) |isbn=978-0-470-08358-1 |edition= Fifth |lay-url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470083581.html |laydate=11 September 2010 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite book |title=Psychological Testing: A Practical Introduction |last=Hogan |first=Thomas P. |author2=Brooke Cannon |year=2007 |edition= Second |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken (NJ) |isbn=978-0-471-73807-7 |lay-url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000675.html |laydate=21 November 2010 |ref=harv }}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Psychological Evaluation}}\n[[Category:Psychiatric assessment]]\n[[Category:Psychological testing]]\n", "text_old": "{{expert needed|Psychology|talk=this High Importance article needs help throughout|reason=High Importance articles deserve attention and care from [[WP:PSYCH]] and others knowledgeable on this topic|date=May 2017}}\n\n'''Psychological evaluation''' is a method to assess an individual's behavior, personality, cognitive abilities, and several other domains.<ref>Framingham, J.

J. (2010). Psychological testing: history, principles, and applications. (7th ed., pp. 1-29 inclusive). Boston, MA: Allyn & Bacon.</ref> It started in China, and many psychologists throughout Europe worked to develop methods of testing into the 1900s. The first tests focused on aptitude. Eventually scientists tried to gauge mental processes in patients with brain damage, then children with special needs.\n\n=== Ancient psychological evaluation ===\nEarliest accounts of evaluation are seen as far back as 2200 B.C. when Chinese emperors were assessed to determine their fitness for office. These rudimentary tests were developed over time until 1370 A.D. when an understanding of classical [[Confucianism]] was introduced as a testing mechanism. As a preliminary evaluation for anyone seeking public office, candidates were required to spend one day and one night in a small space composing essays and writing poetry over assigned topics. Only the top 1% to 7% were selected for higher evaluations, which required three separate session of three days and three nights performing the same tasks. This process continued for one more round until a final group emerged, comprising less than 1% of the original group, became eligible for public office. The Chinese failure to validate their selection procedures, along with widespread discontent over such grueling processes, resulted in the eventual abolishment of the practice by royal decree.<ref name=\"Gregory2010\" />\n\n=== Modern psychological evaluation ===\nIn the 1800s, [[Hubert von Grashey]] developed a battery to determine the abilities of brain-damaged patients. This test was also not favorable, as it took over 100 hours to administer. However, this influenced [[Wilhelm Wundt]], who had the first psychological laboratory in Germany. His tests were shorter, but used similar techniques. Wundt also measured mental processes and acknowledged the fact that there are individual differences between people.\n\nFrances Galton established the first tests in London for measuring [[IQ]]. He tested thousands of people, examining their physical characteristics as a basis for his results and many of the records remain today.<ref name=Gregory2010/> [[James Cattell]] studied with him, and eventually worked on his own with brass instruments for evaluation. His studies led to his paper \"Mental Tests and Measurements\" ,one of the most famous writings on psychological evaluation. He also coined the term \"''mental test''\" in this paper.\n\nAs the 1900s began, [[Alfred Binet]] was also studying evaluation. However, he was more interested in distinguishing children with special needs from their peers after he could not prove in his other research that magnets could cure [[hysteria]]. He did his research in France, with the help of [[Theodore Simon]]. They created a list of questions that were used to determine if children would receive regular instruction, or would participate in special education programs. Their battery was continually revised and developed, until 1911 when the ''Binet-Simon questionnaire'' was finalized for different age levels.\n\nAfter Binet's death, intelligence testing was further studied by [[Charles Spearman]]. He theorized that intelligence was made up of several different subcategories, which were all interrelated. He combined all the factors together to form a general intelligence, which he abbreviated as \"g\".<ref name=Fancher2012>Fancher, R., & Rutherford, A. (2012). Pioneers of psychology. (4th ed., pp. 563-601 inclusive). New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.</ref> This led to [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]]'s idea of an intelligence quotient. He believed that children of different ages should be compared to their peers to determine their mental age in relation to their chronological age. [[Lewis Terman]] combined the Binet-Simon questionnaire with the intelligence quotient and the result was the standard test we use today, with an average score of 100.<ref name=Fancher2012/>\n\nThe large influx of non-English speaking immigrants into the US brought about a change in psychological testing that relied heavily on verbal skills for subjects that were not literate in English, or had speech/hearing difficulties. In 1913, R.H. Sylvester standardized the first non-verbal psychological test. In this particular test, participants fit different shaped blocks into their respective slots on a Seguin form board.<ref name =Gregory2010/> From this test, Knox developed a series of non-verbal psychological tests that he used while working at the Ellis Island immigrant station in 1914. In his tests, were a simple wooden puzzle as well as digit-symbol substitution test where each participant saw digits paired up with a particular symbol, they were then shown the digits and had to write in the symbol that was associated with it.<ref name=Gregory2010/>\n\nWhen the United States moved into World War I, [[Robert M. Yerkes]] convinced the government that they should be testing all of the recruits they were receiving into the Army. The results of the tests could be used to make sure that the \"''mentally incompetent''\" and \"''mentally exceptional''\" were assigned to appropriate jobs. Yerkes and his colleagues developed the [[Army Alpha]] and [[Army Beta]] tests to use on all new recruits.<ref name=Gregory2010/> These tests set a precedent for the development of psychological testing for the next several decades.\n\nAfter seeing the success of the Army standardized tests, college administration quickly picked up on the idea of group testing to decide entrance into their institutions. The [[College Entrance Examination Board]] was created to test applicants to colleges across the nation. In 1925, they developed tests that were no longer essay tests that were very open to interpretation, but now were objective tests that were also the first to be scored by machine. These early tests evolved into modern day College Board tests, like the ''Scholastic Assessment Test'', ''Graduate Record Examination'', and the ''Law School Admissions Test''.<ref name=Gregory2010/>\n\n==Formal and informal evaluation==\nFormal psychological evaluation consists of standardized batteries of tests and highly structured clinician-run interviews, while informal evaluation takes on a completely different tone. In informal evaluation, assessments are based on ''unstructured, free-flowing interviews'' or ''observations'' that allow both the patient and the clinician to guide the content. Both of these methods have their pros and cons. A highly unstructured interview and informal observations provide key findings about the patient that are both efficient and effective. A potential issue with an unstructured, informal approach is the clinician may overlook certain areas of functioning or not notice them at all.<ref name=Meyer2001>Meyer, G., Finn, S., & Eyde, L. (2001). Psychological testing and psychological assessment. American Psychologist, 56(2), 128-165.</ref> Or they might focus too much on presenting complaints. The highly structured interview, although very precise, can cause the clinician to make the mistake of focusing a specific answer to a specific question without considering the response in terms of a broader scope or life context.<ref name=Meyer2001/> They may fail to recognize how the patient's answers all fit together.\n\nThere are many ways that the issues associated with the interview process can be mitigated. The benefits to more formal standardized evaluation types such as batteries and tests are many. First, they measure a large number of characteristics simultaneously. These include personality, cognitive, or neuropsychological characteristics. Second, these tests provide empirically quantified information. The obvious benefit to this is that we can more precisely measure patient characteristics as compared to any kind of structured or unstructured interview. Third, all of these tests have a standardized way of being scored and being administered.<ref name=Meyer2001/> Each patient is presented a standardized stimulus that serves as a benchmark that can be used to determine their characteristics. These types of tests eliminate any possibility of bias and produce results that could be harmful to the patient and cause legal and ethical issues. Fourth, tests are ''normed''. This means that patients can be assessed not only based on their comparison to a \"normal\" individual, but how they compare to the rest of their peers who may have the same psychological issues that they face. Normed tests allow the clinician to make a more individualized assessment of the patient. Fifth, standardized tests that we commonly use today are both valid and reliable.<ref name=Meyer2001/> We know what specific scores mean, how reliable they are, and how the results will affect the patient.\n\nMost clinicians agree that a balanced battery of tests is the most effective way of helping patients. Clinicians should not become victims of blind adherence to any one particular method.<ref name=Fernandez2003>Fernandez-Ballesteros, R. (2003). Encyclopedia of psychological assessment. (Vol. 1, pp. 173-175). London: Sage Publications.</ref>  A balanced battery of tests allows there to be a mix of formal testing processes that allow the clinician to start making their assessment, while conducting more informal, unstructured interviews with the same patient may help the clinician to make more individualized evaluations and help piece together what could potentially be a very complex, unique-to-the-individual kind of issue or problem .<ref name=Fernandez2003/>\n\n==Modern uses==\nPsychological assessment is most often used in the ''psychiatric, medical, legal, educational, or psychological clinic settings''.  The types of assessments and the purposes for them differ among these settings.\n\nIn the [[psychiatric]] setting, the common needs for assessment are to determine risks, whether a person should be admitted or discharged, the location the patients should be held, as well as what therapy the patient should be receiving.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003>Groth-Marnat, G. (2003). ''Handbook of Psychological Assessment.'' Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons.</ref> Within this setting, the psychologists need to be aware of the legal responsibilities that what they can legally do in each situation.\n\nWithin a medical setting, psychological assessment is used to find a possible underlying psychological disorder, emotional factors that may be associated with medical complaints, assessment for neuropsychological deficit, psychological treatment for chronic pain, and the treatment of [[chemical dependency]]. There has been greater importance placed on the patient\u2019s neuropsychological status as neuropsychologists are becoming more concerned with the functioning of the brain.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nPsychological assessment also has a role in the legal setting. Psychologists might be asked to assess the reliability of a witness, the quality of the testimony a witness gives, the competency of an accused person, or determine what might have happened during a crime. They also may help support a plea of insanity or to discount a plea. Judges may use the psychologist's report to change the sentence of a convicted person, and parole officers work with psychologists to create a program for the rehabilitation of a parolee. Problematic areas for psychologists include predicting how dangerous a person will be. There are currently no accurate measure for this prediction, however there is often a need for this prediction to prevent dangerous people from returning to society.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nPsychologists may also be called on to assess a variety of things within an education setting. They may be asked to assess strengths and weaknesses of children who are having difficulty in the school systems, assess behavioral difficulties, assess a child\u2019s responsiveness to an intervention, or to help create an educational plan for a child. The assessment of children also allows for the psychologists to determine if the child will be willing to use the resources that may be provided.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nIn a psychological clinic setting, psychological assessment can be used to determine characteristics of the client that can be useful for developing a treatment plan. Within this setting, psychologists often are working with clients who may have medical or legal problems or sometimes students who were referred to this setting from their school psychologist.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nSome psychological assessments have been validated for use when administered via computer or the Internet.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Briones\n| first = Elizabeth M.\n| last2 = Benham\n| first2 = Grant\n| date = 2016-02-23\n| title = An examination of the equivalency of self-report measures obtained from crowdsourced versus undergraduate student samples\n| journal = Behavior Research Methods\n| volume = 49\n| issue = 1\n| language = en\n| pages = 320\u2013334\n| doi = 10.3758/s13428-016-0710-8\n| pmid = 26907746\n| issn = 1554-3528\n}}</ref> However, caution must be applied to these test results, as it is possible to fake in electronically mediated assessment.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Grieve\n| first = Rachel\n| last2 = Elliott\n| first2 = Jade\n| date = 2013-04-10\n| title = Cyberfaking: I Can, So I Will?

McCrae in 1978. When initially created, it only measured three of the Big Five personality traits: Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, and Extroversion. The inventory was then renamed as the Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Inventory (NEO-I). It was not until 1985 that Agreeableness and Conscientiousness were added to the personality assessment. With all Big Five personality traits being assessed, it was then renamed as the NEO Personality Inventory. Research for the NEO-PI continued over the next few years until a revised manual with six facets for each Big Five trait was published in 1992.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\"/> In the 1990s, now called the NEO PI-R, issues were found with the personality inventory. The developers of the assessment found it to be too difficult for younger people, and another revision was done to create the NEO PI-3.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Costa|first=P.

It consists of 240 personality items and a validity item. It can be administered in roughly 35\u201345 minutes. Every item is answered on a Likert scale, widely known as a scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. If more than 40 items are missing or more than 150 responses or less than 50 responses are Strongly Agree/Disagree, the assessment should be viewed with great caution and has the potential to be invalid.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sigmaassessmentsystems.com/assessments/neo-personality-inventory-3/|title=NEO Personality Inventory-3 {{!}} SIGMA|work=SIGMA Assessment Systems|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}</ref> In the NEO report, each trait's T score is recorded along with the percentile they rank on compared to all data recorded for the assessment.

Low scores suggest feeling relaxed and calm. \n** Angry Hostility \n*** High scores suggest feeling anger and frustration often. Low scores suggest being easy-going.\n** Depression \n*** High scores suggest feeling guilty, sad, hopeless, and lonely. Low scores suggest less feeling of that of someone who scores highly, but not necessarily being light-hearted and cheerful. \n** Self-Consciousness \n*** High scores suggest shame, embarrassment, and sensitivity. Low scores suggest being less affected by others' opinions, but not necessarily having good social skills or poise.\n** Impulsiveness\n*** High scores suggest the inability to control cravings and urges. Low scores suggest easy resistance to such urges.\n** Vulnerability \n*** High scores suggest inability to cope with stress, being dependent, and feeling panicked in high stress situations. Low scores suggest capability to handle stressful situations.\n* Extraversion\n** Warmth\n*** High scores suggest friendliness and affectionate behavior. Low scores suggest being more formal, reserved, and distant. A low score does not necessarily mean being hostile or lacking compassion.\n** Gregariousness\n*** High scores suggest wanting the company of others. Low scores tend to be from those who avoid social stimulation.\n** Assertiveness\n*** High scores suggest a forceful and dominant person who lacks hesitation. Low scores suggest are more passive and try not to stand out in a crowd.\n** Activity\n*** High scores suggest a more energetic and upbeat personality and lead a quicker paced lifestyle. Low scores suggest the person is more leisurely, but does not imply being lazy or slow. \n** Excitement-Seeking\n*** High scores suggest a person who seeks and craves excitement and is similar to those with high sensation seeking. Low scores seek a less exciting lifestyle and come off more boring. \n** Positive Emotions\n*** High scores suggest the tendency to feel happier, laugh more, and are optimistic. Low scorers are not necessarily unhappy, but more so are less high-spirited and are more pessimistic.\n{{colend}}\n{{colbegin}}\n* Openness to Experience\n** Fantasy\n*** Those who score high in fantasy have a more creative imagination and daydream frequently. Low scores suggest a person who lives more in the moment. \n** Aesthetics\n*** High scores suggest a love and appreciation for art and physical beauty. These people are more emotionally attached to music, artwork, and poetry. Low scorers have a lack of interest in the arts. \n** Feelings\n*** High scorers have a deeper ability to experience emotion and see their emotions as more important than those who score low on this facet. Low scorers are less expressive.\n** Actions\n*** High scores suggest a more open-mindedness to traveling and experiencing new things. These people prefer novelty over a routine life. Low scorers prefer a scheduled life and dislike change.\n** Ideas\n*** Active pursuit of knowledge, high curiosity, and the enjoyment of brain teasers and philosophical are common of those who score high on this facet. Those who score lower are not necessarily less intelligent, nor does a high score imply high intelligence. However, those who score lower are more narrow in their interests and have low curiosity. \n** Values\n*** High scorers are more investigative of political, social, and religious values. Those who score lower and more accepting of authority and honor more traditional values. High scorers are more typically liberal while lower scorers are more typically conservative.  \n* Agreeableness\n** Trust\n*** High scores are more trusting of others and believe others are honest and have good intentions. Low scorers are more skeptical, cynical, and assumes others are dishonest and/or dangerous.\n** Straightforwardness\n*** Those who score high in this facet are more sincere and frank. Low scorers are more deceitful and more willing to manipulate others, but this does not mean they should be labeled as a dishonest or manipulative person. \n** Altruism\n*** High scores suggest a person concerned with the well-being of others and show it through generosity, willingness to help others, and volunteering for those less fortunate. Low scores suggest a more self-centered person who is less willing to go out of their way to help others.\n** Compliance\n*** High scorers are more inclined to avoid conflict and tend to forgive easily. Low scores suggest a more aggressive personality and a love for competition.\n** Modesty\n*** High scorers are more humble, but not necessarily lacking in self-esteem or confidence. Low scorers believe they're more superior than others and may come off as more conceited.\n** Tender-Mindedness\n*** This facet scales one's concern for others and their ability to empathize. High scorers are more moved by others' emotions, while low scorers are more hardheaded and typically consider themselves realists. \n{{colend}}\n* Conscientiousness\n** Competence\n*** High scores suggest one is capable, sensible, prudent, effective, and are well-prepared to deal with whatever happens in life. Low scores suggest a potential lower self-esteem and are often unprepared. \n** Order\n*** High scorers are more neat and tidy, while low scorers lack organization and are unmethodical.\n** Dutifulness\n*** Those who score highly in this facet are more strict about their ethical principles and are more dependable. Low scorers are less reliable and are more casual about their morals.\n** Achievement Striving\n*** Those who score highly in this facet have higher aspirations and work harder to achieve their goals. However, they may be too invested in their work and become a workaholic. Low scorers are much less ambitious and perhaps even lazy. They are often content with their lack of goal-seeking.\n** Self-Discipline\n*** High scorers complete whatever task is assigned to them and are self-motivated. Low scorers often procrastinate and are easily discouraged.\n** Deliberation\n*** High scorers tend to think more than low scorers before acting. High scorers are more cautious and deliberate while low scorers are more hasty and act without considering the consequences.\n\n=== HEXACO-PI ===\nThe [[HEXACO model of personality structure|HEXACO]]-PI, developed by Lee and Ashton in the early 2000s, is a personality inventory used to measure six different dimensions of personality which have been found in lexical studies across various cultures. There are two versions of the HEXACO: the HEXACO-PI and the HEXACO-PI-R which are examined with either self reports or observer reports. The HEXACO-PI-R has forms of three lengths: 200 items, 100 items, and 60 items. Items from each form are grouped to measure scales of more narrow personality traits, which are them grouped into broad  scales of the six dimensions: honesty & humility (H), emotionality (E), Extraversion (X), agreeableness (A), conscientiousness (C), and openness to experience (O).The HEXACO-PI-R includes various traits associated with neuroticism and can be used to help identify trait tendencies. One table which give examples of typically high loaded adjectives on the six factors of HEXACO can be found in Ashton's book \"Individual Differences and Personality\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Adjective relating to the six factors within the HEXACO structure\n!Personality Factor\n!Narrow Personality Traits\n!Related Adjectives\n|-\n|Honesty-Humility\n|Sincerity, fairness, greed-avoidance, modesty\n|Sincere, honest, faithful/loyal, modest/unassuming, fair-minded versus sly, deceitful, greedy, pretentious, hypocritical, boastful, pompous\n|-\n|Emotionality\n|Fearfulness, anxiety, depenence, sentimentality\n|Emotional, oversensitive, sentrimental, fearful, anxious, vulnerable versus brave, tough, independenct, self-assured, stable\n|-\n|Extraversion\n|Social self-esteem, social boldness, sociability, liveliness\n|Outgoing, lively, extraverted, sociable, talkative, cheerful, active versus shy, passive, withdrawn, introverted, quiet, reserved \n|-\n|Agreeableness\n|Forgivingness, gentleness, flexibility, patience\n|Patient, tolerant, peaceful, mild, agreeable, lenient, gentle versus ill-tempered, quarelsome, stubborn, choleric\n|-\n|Conscientiousness\n|Organization, diligence, perfectionism, prudence\n|Organized, disciplined, diligent, careful, thorough, precise verus sloppy, negligent, reckless, lazy, irresponsible, absent-minded\n|-\n|Openess to Experience\n|Aesthetic appreciation, inquisitiveness, creativity, unconventionality\n|Intellectual, creative, unconventional, innovative, ironic versus shallow, unimaginative, conventional\n|}\nOne benefit of using the HEXACO is that of the facet of neurotocism within the factor of emotionality: trait neurotocism has been shown to have a moderate positive correlation with people with anxiety and depression. The identification of trait neuroticism on a scale, paired with anxiety, and/or depression is beneficial in a clinical setting for introductory screenings some personality disorders. Because the HEXACO has facets which help identify traits of neuroticism, it is also a helpful indicator of the dark triad.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Joshua D.|last2=Lynam|first2=Donald R.|date=2015-03-01|title=Using Self- and Informant Reports in the Assessment of Personality Pathology in Clinical Settings\u2014An Easy and Effective 1\u20132 Combination|journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=20\u201324|doi=10.1111/cpsp.12090|issn=1468-2850}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.skums.ac.ir/3943/|title=The efficacy of emotionality factor of HEXACO-PI-R on screening of depressive and anxiety disorder (mixed) in university students|last=H.|first=Palahang|last2=M.|first2=Nikfarjam|date=2011|website=eprints.skums.ac.ir|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16|last3=A.|first3=Salahian}}</ref>\n\n==Pseudopsychology (pop psychology) in assessment==\nAlthough there have been many great advancements in the field of psychological evaluation, some issues have also developed.  One of the main problems in the field is ''pseudopsychology'', also called [[pop psychology]].  Psychological evaluation is one of the biggest aspects in pop psychology.  In a clinical setting, patients are not aware that they are not receiving correct psychological treatment, and that belief is one of the main foundations of pseudopsychology.  It is largely based upon the testimonies of previous patients, the avoidance of peer review (a critical aspect of any science), and poorly set up tests, which can include confusing language or conditions that are left up to interpretation.<ref name=Lilienfeld2003>Lilienfeld, S., Lynn, S., & Lohr, J. (2003). ''Science and pseudoscience in clinical psychology.'' (1st ed., pp. 1-25 inclusive). New York, NY: The Guilford Press.</ref>\n\nPseudopsychology can also occur when people claim to be psychologists, but really lack qualifications.<ref name=Burt1948>Burtt, Harold Ernest, (1948). ''Applied psychology'', (pp. 38-63). New York, NY, US: Prentice-Hall, Inc, x, 821 pp.</ref>  A prime example of this is found in quizzes that can lead to a variety of false conclusions.  These can be found in magazines, online, or just about anywhere accessible to the public.  They usually consist of a small number of questions designed to tell the participant things about themselves.  The problem is, they\u2019re usually written by people who know nothing about psychological assessment, and have no research or evidence to back up any diagnosis made by the quizzes.<ref name=Burt1948/> These types of things can tarnish the reputation for true psychological assessment.\n\n==Ethics==\nConcerns about privacy, cultural biases, tests that have not been validated, and inappropriate contexts have led groups such as the [[American Educational Research Association]] (AERA) and the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) to publish guidelines for examiners in regards to assessment.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/> The American Psychological Association states that a client must give permission to release any of the information that may come from a psychologist.<ref name=APA2010 >{{cite web | publisher=American Psychological Association | year=2010 | title=Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct | url=https://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index | accessdate=6 February 2020 }} (Amended to 1 January 2017)</ref> The only exceptions to this are in the case of minors, when the clients are a danger to themselves or others, or if they are applying for a job that requires this information. Also, the issue of privacy occurs during the assessment itself. The client has the right to say as much or little as they would like, however they may feel the need to say more than they want or even may accidentally reveal information they would like to keep private.<ref name= Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nGuidelines have been put in place to ensure the psychologist giving the assessments maintains a professional relationship with the client since their relationship can impact the outcomes of the assessment. The examiner's expectations may also influence the client\u2019s performance in the assessments.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\nThe validity and reliability of the tests being used also can affect the outcomes of the assessments being used. When psychologists are choosing which assessments they are going to use, they should pick one that will be most effective for what they are looking at. Also, it is important for the psychologists are aware of the possibility of the client, either consciously or unconsciously, faking answers and consider use of tests that have [[validity scale]]s within them.<ref name=Groth-Marnat2003/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Psychoanalysis]]\n* Corresponding evaluations in related fields\n** [[Neurological examination]] in [[neurology]]\n** [[Mental state examination]] in [[psychiatry]]\n** [[Physical examination]] in [[medicine]]\n* [[Therapeutic assessment]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last1=Anastasi |first1=Anne |last2=Urbina |first2=Susana |authorlink1=Anne Anastasi |authorlink2=Susana Urbina |title=Psychological Testing |edition= Seventh |location=Upper Saddle River (NJ) |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |isbn=978-0-02-303085-7 |year=1997 |lay-url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Psychological-Testing-7E/9780023030857.page |laydate=28 July 2010 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite book |title=Comprehensive Handbook of Psychological Assessment: Volume I: Intellectual and Neurological Assessment |editor1-last=Goldstein |editor1-first=Gerald |editor2-last=Beers |editor2-first=Susan  |year=2004 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken (NJ) |isbn=978-0-471-41611-1 |lay-url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471416118,descCd-tableOfContents.html |laydate=23 November 2010 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite book |title=Psychological Testing: History, Principles, and Applications |last=Gregory |first=Robert J. |year=2011 |edition= Sixth |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-78214-7 |lay-url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/bookseller/product/Psychological-Testing-History-Principles-and-Applications-6E/9780205782147.page |laydate=7 November 2010 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite book |title=Handbook of Psychological Assessment |last=Groth-Marnat |first=Gary |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken (NJ) |isbn=978-0-470-08358-1 |edition= Fifth |lay-url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470083581.html |laydate=11 September 2010 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite book |title=Psychological Testing: A Practical Introduction |last=Hogan |first=Thomas P. |author2=Brooke Cannon |year=2007 |edition= Second |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken (NJ) |isbn=978-0-471-73807-7 |lay-url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000675.html |laydate=21 November 2010 |ref=harv }}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Psychological Evaluation}}\n[[Category:Psychiatric assessment]]\n[[Category:Psychological testing]]\n", "name_user": "Markworthen", "label": "safe", "comment": "Grammar; btw, in my previous edit, \"other\" should have been \"although\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"}

It was released in the UK in February 1974 by [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] as the [[lead single]] from the album ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''. Written and produced by Bowie, the song is based around a distinctive guitar [[riff]] reminiscent of [[the Rolling Stones]]. Cited as his most-covered track, \"Rebel Rebel\" has been described as Bowie's farewell to the [[glam rock]] movement that he had helped initiate, as well as being a [[proto-punk]] track.<ref name=\"greene\"/> Two versions of the song were recorded: the well-known UK single release and the shorter US single release, which featured added background vocals, extra percussion and a new arrangement.\n\nUpon its release, the song was a commercial success, peaking at number five on the UK [[UK Singles Chart|Singles Chart]] and number 64 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. The song also received critical acclaim for its central guitar riff and strength as a glam anthem. Several publications consider it to be one of Bowie's greatest songs. It was frequently performed live by Bowie during many of his concert tours and since appeared on many [[compilation album]]s. In 2016 it was remastered as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\n==Background==\nOriginally planned in late 1973 as part of an aborted ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' musical,{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=140}} \"Rebel Rebel\" was Bowie's last single in his signature [[glam rock]] style.<ref name=\"snow\">Mat Snow (2007). \"Hang on to Yourself\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': p.51</ref>{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=210\u2013217}} It was also his first hit since 1969 not to feature lead guitarist [[Mick Ronson]]; Bowie played guitar himself on this and almost all the other tracks on ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'', producing what ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] called \"a rocking dirty noise that owed as much to [[Keith Richards]] as it did to the departed Ronno\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=60}} Singer-songwriter [[Jayne County]], who was a cast member of ''Pork'' and among Bowie's entourage for two years, maintains that her 1973 song \"Queenage Baby\", which included the lyric \"can't tell whether she's a boy or a girl\", was an influence for \"Rebel Rebel\", a claim which is supported by some rock critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.punkglobe.com/waynecountytrucksreview.html |title=Punk Globe Magazine Online |publisher=Punkglobe.com |date= |accessdate=5 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175258/http://www.punkglobe.com/waynecountytrucksreview.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Thompson| first=Dave| title=''Wayne County at the Trucks!'' \u2013 Jayne County| website=[[AllMusic]]| url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/wayne-county-at-the-trucks%21-mw0000811588| accessdate=2 February 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011224241/http://www.allmusic.com/album/wayne-county-at-the-trucks%21-mw0000811588| archive-date=11 October 2016| url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"RS 30 essentials\" />{{sfn|Pegg|2011|p=904}}\n\n==Recording and composition==\nRecording for \"Rebel Rebel\" began at a solo session at [[Trident Studios]] in London following Christmas 1973. It would be Bowie's last known visit to Trident, his principal recording studio since 1968.{{sfn|Pegg|2011|p=906}} The recording was subsequently completed the following month in January 1974.<ref name=\"snow\" /> According to biographer [[Marc Spitz]], the lyrics of \"Rebel Rebel\" revisit familiar Bowie territory, featuring \"a 'hot' young 'tramp' worrying his or her parents with his or her sexy nihilism\", are reflected by the line \"You got a few lines and a handful of 'ludes'.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=232}} Even though the world is ending, the \"Rebel\" doesn't care, suggesting \"we like dancing and we look divine.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=232}} It also features gender-bending lyrics (\"You got your mother in a whirl / She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl\"). According to author [[Peter Doggett]], in the context of ''Diamond Dogs'', the song serves as a \"musical continuation\" between the \"[[Sweet Thing (David Bowie song)|Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing (Reprise)]]\" medley: it begins with a D to E chord change that was prefigured with a bass guitar slide that constructed the medley's final \"chaotic\" moments.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=238}} \n\nThe song's distinctive guitar [[riff]] is described by rock journalist [[Kris Needs]] as \"a classic stick-in-the-head like the [[The Rolling Stones|Stones]]' '[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction|Satisfaction]]'\".<ref>[[Kris Needs]] (1983). ''Bowie: A Celebration'': p.29</ref> The riff's chords are D, E, and A and were created by Bowie and enhanced by the session musician [[Alan Parker (musician)|Alan Parker]], who, according to Doggett, added the \"downward trail\" at the end of each line.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=238}} Bowie later said, \"It's a fabulous riff!

In early 2003, he recorded a new version, featuring an arrangement by [[Mark Plati]] without the original's reference to [[Methaqualone|quaaludes]].

song by English singer-songwriter [[David Bowie]]. It was released in the UK in February 1974 by [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] as the [[lead single]] from the album ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''. Written and produced by Bowie, the song is based around a distinctive guitar [[riff]] reminiscent of [[the Rolling Stones]]. Cited as his most-covered track, \"Rebel Rebel\" has been described as Bowie's farewell to the [[glam rock]] movement that he had helped initiate, as well as being a [[proto-punk]] track.<ref name=\"greene\"/> Two versions of the song were recorded: the well-known UK single release and the shorter US single release, which featured added background vocals, extra percussion and a new arrangement.\n\nUpon its release, the song was a commercial success, peaking at number five on the UK [[UK Singles Chart|Singles Chart]] and number 64 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. The song also received critical acclaim for its central guitar riff and strength as a glam anthem. Several publications consider it to be one of Bowie's greatest songs. It was frequently performed live by Bowie during many of his concert tours and since appeared on many [[compilation album]]s. In 2016 it was remastered as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\n==Background==\nOriginally planned in late 1973 as part of an aborted ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' musical,{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=140}} \"Rebel Rebel\" was Bowie's last single in his signature [[glam rock]] style.<ref name=\"snow\">Mat Snow (2007). \"Hang on to Yourself\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': p.51</ref>{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=210\u2013217}} It was also his first hit since 1969 not to feature lead guitarist [[Mick Ronson]]; Bowie played guitar himself on this and almost all the other tracks on ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'', producing what ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] called \"a rocking dirty noise that owed as much to [[Keith Richards]] as it did to the departed Ronno\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=60}} Singer-songwriter [[Jayne County]], who was a cast member of ''Pork'' and among Bowie's entourage for two years, maintains that her 1973 song \"Queenage Baby\", which included the lyric \"can't tell whether she's a boy or a girl\", was an influence for \"Rebel Rebel\", a claim which is supported by some rock critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.punkglobe.com/waynecountytrucksreview.html |title=Punk Globe Magazine Online |publisher=Punkglobe.com |date= |accessdate=5 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175258/http://www.punkglobe.com/waynecountytrucksreview.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Thompson| first=Dave| title=''Wayne County at the Trucks!'' \u2013 Jayne County| website=[[AllMusic]]| url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/wayne-county-at-the-trucks%21-mw0000811588| accessdate=2 February 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011224241/http://www.allmusic.com/album/wayne-county-at-the-trucks%21-mw0000811588| archive-date=11 October 2016| url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"RS 30 essentials\" />{{sfn|Pegg|2011|p=904}}\n\n==Recording and composition==\nRecording for \"Rebel Rebel\" began at a solo session at [[Trident Studios]] in London following Christmas 1973. It would be Bowie's last known visit to Trident, his principal recording studio since 1968.{{sfn|Pegg|2011|p=906}} The recording was subsequently completed the following month in January 1974.<ref name=\"snow\" /> According to biographer [[Marc Spitz]], the lyrics of \"Rebel Rebel\" revisit familiar Bowie territory, featuring \"a 'hot' young 'tramp' worrying his or her parents with his or her sexy nihilism\", are reflected by the line \"You got a few lines and a handful of 'ludes'.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=232}} Even though the world is ending, the \"Rebel\" doesn't care, suggesting \"we like dancing and we look divine.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=232}} It also features gender-bending lyrics (\"You got your mother in a whirl / She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl\"). According to author [[Peter Doggett]], in the context of ''Diamond Dogs'', the song serves as a \"musical continuation\" between the \"[[Sweet Thing (David Bowie song)|Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing (Reprise)]]\" medley: it begins with a D to E chord change that was prefigured with a bass guitar slide that constructed the medley's final \"chaotic\" moments.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=238}} \n\nThe song's distinctive guitar [[riff]] is described by rock journalist [[Kris Needs]] as \"a classic stick-in-the-head like the [[The Rolling Stones|Stones]]' '[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction|Satisfaction]]'\".<ref>[[Kris Needs]] (1983).

During the height of the Iraq War in 2006 to 2008, the fighting involved both armed conflict against the American-led military coalition, as well as [[Sectarian violence in Iraq|sectarian violence]] among the different ethnic groups within the population. The insurgents were involved in [[asymmetric warfare]] and a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against the American-supported Iraqi government and American forces in central Iraq, while conducting coercive tactics against rivals or other militias. Iraq's deep sectarian divides have been a major dynamic in the insurgency, with support for the insurgents varying among different segments of the population.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|2003 invasion of Iraq}}\nThe [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] (19 March \u2013 1 May 2003) began the [[Iraq War]], or ''Operation Iraqi Freedom'', in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and [[Poland]] invaded Iraq and toppled the government of [[Saddam Hussein]] within 21 days of major combat operations. The invasion phase consisted of a conventionally fought war which concluded with the capture of the Iraq capital [[Baghdad]] by U.S. forces.\n\nFour countries participated with troops during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. These were the United States (148,000), United Kingdom (45,000), Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). [[Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq|Thirty-six other countries]] were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in [[Kuwait]] by 18 February.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html|title=U.S. has 100,000 troops in Kuwait|work=CNN|date=18 February 2003|access-date=1 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108211421/http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html|archive-date=8 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The United States supplied the majority of the invading forces, but also received support from [[Peshmerga|Kurdish irregulars]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].\n\nThe invasion was preceded by an [[air strike]] on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 19 March 2003. The following day coalition forces launched an incursion into [[Basra Province]] from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the [[Persian Gulf]] to secure [[Basra]] and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]] was [[Operation Northern Delay|airdropped]] near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]] where they joined forces with [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] rebels and fought several actions against the [[Iraqi army]] to secure the northern part of the country.\n\nThe main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of [[Tikrit]] on 15 April. [[Iraqi President]] Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country.\n\nOn 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion stage of the Iraq War and beginning the [[military occupation]] period and the Iraqi insurgency against coalition forces.\n\n== History ==\n{{Further|Timeline of the Iraq War}}\n\n=== First phase of insurgency (2003\u201306) ===\n{{Main|Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201306)}}\n[[File:TallAfar.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army [[M1A2 Abrams]] tanks patrol the streets of Tal Afar, Iraq in February 2005.]]\nThe Iraqi insurgency of 2003\u201306 erupted following the invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein's rule in May 2003.

These policies may not necessarily espouse a [[Pan-Arab]] ideology, but rather advocate the country's [[territorial integrity]] including [[Kuwait]] and [[Kh\u016bzest\u0101n Province|Khuzestan]]. Historical figures of this movement include the pre-Ba'athist leader of Iraq [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] and his government.\n* Iraqi [[Salafi]] [[Islamism|Islamists]], the indigenous armed followers of the Salafi movement, as well as any remnants of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Ansar al-Islam]]: individuals with a Salafi-only policy opposed to non-Salafis though not aligned to one specific ethnic group. Though opposed to the U.S.-led invasion, these groups are not wholly sympathetic towards the former Ba'ath Party as its members included non-Salafis.\n* [[Shi'a]] militias, including the southern, [[Iran]]-linked [[Badr Organization]], the [[Mahdi Army]], and the central-Iraq followers of [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]. These groups neither advocate the dominance of a single ethnic group, nor the traditional ideologies behind the Iraqi state (e.g. these particular Shi'as do not support the capture of Khuzestan or other border areas with Iran, but rather promote warm relations with Iran's Shi'a government).\n* Foreign Islamist volunteers, including those often linked to [[al Qaeda]] and largely driven by the Salafi/Wahhabi doctrine (the two preceding categories are often lumped as \"[[jihad]]ists\");\n* Possibly some socialist revolutionaries (such as the [[Iraqi Armed Revolutionary Resistance]], which claimed one attack in 2007).\n* [[Non-violent resistance]] groups and political parties (not part of the armed insurgency).\n\n=== Arab Nationalist ===\n==== Ba'athists ====\n{{Further|Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region}}\n[[File:Flag of the Ba'ath Party.svg|thumb|[[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] flag]]\nThe Ba'athists include former [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] officials, the [[Fedayeen Saddam]], and some former agents of the Iraqi intelligence elements and security services, such as the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service|Mukhabarat]] and the [[Special Security Organization]]. Their goal, at least before the capture of Saddam Hussein, was the restoration of the former Ba'athist government to power. The pre-war organization of the Ba'ath Party and its militias as a cellular{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} structure aided the continued pro-Saddam resistance after the fall of Baghdad, and Iraqi intelligence operatives may have developed a plan for [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] following the toppling of Saddam Hussein from power.\n\nFollowing Saddam's capture, the Ba'athist movement largely faded; its surviving factions were increasingly shifting to either nationalist factions (Iraqi, though not Pan-Arab, such as the ideology of the pre-Ba'athist regime), or Islamist (Sunni or Shia, depending on the actual faith of the individual, though Ba'ath Party policy had been secular, and many of its members were atheist).\n\nAs the goal of restoring the Ba'ath Party to power was seemingly out of reach, the alternative solution appeared to be to join forces with organisations who opposed the U.S.-led invasion. Many former Ba'athists had adopted an [[Islamist]] fa\u00e7ade to attract more credibility within the country, and perhaps gain support from outside Iraq. Others, especially following the January 2005 elections, became more interested in politics.<!-- commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Fedayeen-Saddam.jpg|thumb|Fedayeen Saddam, irregular soldiers loyal to the former Iraqi Ba'athist regime]] -->\n\nThe fall of Baghdad effectively ended the existence of the [[Fedayeen Saddam]] as an organized paramilitary. Several of its members died during the war. A large number survived, however, and were willing to carry on the fight even after the fall of Saddam Hussein from power. Many former members joined guerrilla organizations that began to form to resist the U.S-led coalition in Iraq. By June, an insurgency was underway in central and northern Iraq, especially in an area known as the [[Sunni Triangle]].

The group is currently based in [[Karbala, Iraq]], and is also active in areas throughout southern Iraq. The group was formed by the Iranian Government to fight the Saddam Hussein-controlled Iraq during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. Originally, the group consisted of Iraqi exiles who were banished from Iraq during the reign of Saddam Hussein. After the war ended in 1988, the organization remained in Iran until Saddam Hussein was overthrown during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Following the invasion, the brigade then moved into Iraq, became members of the new Iraq Army, and aided coalition forces in insurgents.\n\nColonel Derek Harvey told Reuters \"that the U.S. military detained Badr assassination teams possessing target lists of Sunni officers and pilots in 2003 and 2004 but did not hold them. Harvey said his superiors told him that 'this stuff had to play itself out' \u2013 implying that revenge attacks by returning Shi'ite groups were to be expected.

One particular document, which was apparently written after he lost power, appeared to be a directive to his Ba'athist loyalists warning them to be wary of [[Islamist]] [[mujahideen]] and other foreign Arabs entering the country to join the insurgency. The directive supposedly shows Saddam having concerns that foreign fighters would not share the same objectives as Ba'ath loyalists (i.e. the eventual return of Saddam to power and the restoration of his regime). A U.S. official commenting on the document stressed that while Saddam urged his followers to be cautious in their dealings with other Arab fighters, he did not order them to avoid contact or rule out co-operation. [[Bruce Hoffman]], a Washington counter-terrorism expert stated that the existence of the document underscores the fact that \"this is an insurgency cut of many different cloths...[and] everybody's jockeying for their position of power in the future Iraq.\" Many experts believe that fighters from other countries who have flocked to Iraq to join the insurgents are motivated by animosity toward the United States and the desire to install an Islamic state in place of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]]'s secular [[regime]].<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/15/1073877963219.html Saddam warning on Islamist forces] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428222223/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/15/1073877963219.html |date=28 April 2008}}, ''[[The Age]]'', 16 January 2004.</ref>\n\nForeign fighters are mostly Arabs from neighboring countries, who have entered Iraq, primarily through the porous desert borders of Syria and Saudi Arabia, to assist the Iraqi insurgency. Many of these fighters are [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] fundamentalists who see Iraq as the new \"field of [[jihad]]\" in the battle against U.S. forces. It is generally believed that most are freelance fighters, but a few members of [[Al-Qaeda]] and the related group [[Ansar al-Islam]] are suspected of infiltrating into the Sunni areas of Iraq through the mountainous northeastern border with [[Iran]]. The United States and its allies point to Jordanian-born Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader [[Abu&nbsp;Musab&nbsp;al-Zarqawi]] as the key player in this group. Zarqawi was considered the head of an insurgent group called [[Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad]] (\"Monotheism and Holy War\") until his death on 7 June 2006, which according to U.S. estimates numbers in the low hundreds.\n\nUsage of the term \"foreign fighters\" has received criticism as being Western-centric because, taken literally, the term would encompass all non-Iraqi forces, including Coalition forces.<ref>[http://www.countercurrents.org/iraq-fisk301003.htm \"This is a Resistance Movement, Whether We Like It or Not\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050421233325/http://www.countercurrents.org/iraq-fisk301003.htm |date=21 April 2005}} by Robert Fisk.

Heavy guerrilla activity also takes place around the cities of Mosul and [[Tal Afar]] in the north, as well as the \"[[Triangle of Death (Iraq)|Triangle of Death]]\" south of Baghdad, which includes the \"-iya\" cities of Iskandariya, Mahmudiya, Latifiya, and Yusufiya. Lesser activity takes place in several other areas of the country. The insurgents are believed to maintain a key supply line stretching from Syria through al-Qaim and along the Euphrates to Baghdad and central Iraq, the Iraqi equivalent of the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]]. A second \"ratline\" runs from the Syrian border through Tal Afar to Mosul.\n[[File:Iraqcontrol.JPG|thumb|right|Provincial control of Iraq in September 2011 {{legend|green|Coalition control}}]]\nAlthough estimates of the total number of Iraqi guerrillas varies by group and fluctuates under changing political climate, the latest assessments put the present number at between 3,000 and 7,000 fighters along with numerous supporters and facilitators throughout the Sunni Arab community. At various points U.S. forces provided estimates on the number of fighters in specific regions. A few are provided here (although these numbers almost certainly have fluctuated):\n* Fallujah (mid-2004): 2,000\u20135,000 In a November 2004 operation, the Fallujah insurgency has been destroyed or dispersed, but had staged a comeback in 2005, albeit not to former strength, in the course of 2005\u20132008 the remainder of the insurgency was defeated in Fallujah and the rest of Al-Anbar province.\n* [[Samarra]] (August 2011): 1,000+\n* [[Baquba]] (August 2011 ): 1,000+\n* Baghdad (August 2011): 2,000+\nGuerilla forces operate in many of the cities and towns of [[al-Anbar]] province, due to mostly ineffective Iraqi security forces in this area. There was extensive guerrilla activity in [[Ramadi]], the capital of the province, as well as [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qa'im]], the first stop on an insurgent movement route between Iraq and Syria. In 2006, reports suggested that the Anbar capital Ramadi had largely fallen under insurgent control along with most of the Anbar region, and that as a result the United States had sent an extra 3,500 marines to reestablish control of the region. In the early part of 2007 the insurgency suffered serious setbacks in Ramadi after they were defeated in the Second Battle of Ramadi in the fall of 2006. With the help of the [[Anbar Salvation Council]], incidents fell from an average of 30 attacks per day in December 2006 to an average of fewer than four in April 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-kidcops7may07,1,648855.story?coll=la-news-a_section |title=A ragtag solution with real results|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=7 May 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2010 |first=Chris |last=Kraul |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605161954/http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-kidcops7may07%2C1%2C648855.story?coll=la-news-a_section |archivedate= 5 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nBaghdad is still one of the most violent regions of the country, even after the 2007 troop surge more than two-thirds of the violence that takes place in Iraq happens in Baghdad even though the Iraqi Government is in firm control of the entire city.

They also cite a recent BBC/ABC poll which found 100% of Iraqis polled disapproved of attacks on Iraqi civilians.\"</ref> while latterly [[Iraqi security forces]], seen by Iraqi insurgents as [[Collaborationism|collaborators]] with the coalition, were also targeted.\n\nWith the full-scale eruption of the [[Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006\u20132008)|sectarian civil war]] in February 2006, many militant attacks in American-controlled central Iraq were directed at the [[Iraqi police]] and [[new Iraqi Army|military forces]] of the [[Al Maliki I Government|Iraqi government]]. The attacks continued during the transitional [[reconstruction of Iraq]], as the Iraqi government tried to establish itself. Civil war violence decreased in late 2008 and the insurgency continued through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|American withdrawal]] from Iraq in 2011. After the withdrawal in December 2011, [[Iraqi insurgency (2011\u201313)|a renewed wave of sectarian and anti-government insurgency]] swept Iraq, causing thousands of casualties in 2012. Increasing violence in 2013 raised fears of another civil war.\n\nThe insurgents in Iraq have been composed of a [[Private militias in Iraq|diverse mix of militias]], foreign fighters, all-Iraqi units or mixtures opposing the American-led Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq and the post-2003 [[Iraqi government]]. During the height of the Iraq War in 2006 to 2008, the fighting involved both armed conflict against the American-led military coalition, as well as [[Sectarian violence in Iraq|sectarian violence]] among the different ethnic groups within the population. The insurgents were involved in [[asymmetric warfare]] and a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against the American-supported Iraqi government and American forces in central Iraq, while conducting coercive tactics against rivals or other militias. Iraq's deep sectarian divides have been a major dynamic in the insurgency, with support for the insurgents varying among different segments of the population.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|2003 invasion of Iraq}}\nThe [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] (19 March \u2013 1 May 2003) began the [[Iraq War]], or ''Operation Iraqi Freedom'', in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and [[Poland]] invaded Iraq and toppled the government of [[Saddam Hussein]] within 21 days of major combat operations. The invasion phase consisted of a conventionally fought war which concluded with the capture of the Iraq capital [[Baghdad]] by U.S. forces.\n\nFour countries participated with troops during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. These were the United States (148,000), United Kingdom (45,000), Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). [[Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq|Thirty-six other countries]] were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in [[Kuwait]] by 18 February.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html|title=U.S. has 100,000 troops in Kuwait|work=CNN|date=18 February 2003|access-date=1 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108211421/http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html|archive-date=8 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The United States supplied the majority of the invading forces, but also received support from [[Peshmerga|Kurdish irregulars]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].\n\nThe invasion was preceded by an [[air strike]] on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 19 March 2003. The following day coalition forces launched an incursion into [[Basra Province]] from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the [[Persian Gulf]] to secure [[Basra]] and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]] was [[Operation Northern Delay|airdropped]] near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]] where they joined forces with [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] rebels and fought several actions against the [[Iraqi army]] to secure the northern part of the country.\n\nThe main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of [[Tikrit]] on 15 April. [[Iraqi President]] Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country.\n\nOn 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion stage of the Iraq War and beginning the [[military occupation]] period and the Iraqi insurgency against coalition forces.\n\n== History ==\n{{Further|Timeline of the Iraq War}}\n\n=== First phase of insurgency (2003\u201306) ===\n{{Main|Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201306)}}\n[[File:TallAfar.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army [[M1A2 Abrams]] tanks patrol the streets of Tal Afar, Iraq in February 2005.]]\nThe Iraqi insurgency of 2003\u201306 erupted following the invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein's rule in May 2003. The armed insurgent opposition to the United States-led [[Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq|multinational force in Iraq]] and the post-2003 Iraqi government lasted until early 2006, when it deteriorated into a sectarian civil war, the most violent phase of the Iraq War.\n\n=== Sectarian civil war (2006\u20132008) ===\n{{Main|Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006\u201308)}}\nFollowing the U.S.-launched 2003 invasion of Iraq, the situation deteriorated, and by 2007, the [[communal violence|intercommunal violence]] between Iraqi [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] factions was described by the [[National Intelligence Estimate]] as having elements of a civil war.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Elements of 'civil war' in Iraq|quote=A US intelligence assessment on Iraq says \"civil war\" accurately describes certain aspects of the conflict, including intense sectarian violence.|date=2 February 2007|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/middle_east/6324767.stm|journal=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref> In a 10 January 2007 address to the American people, President [[George W.

These policies may not necessarily espouse a [[Pan-Arab]] ideology, but rather advocate the country's [[territorial integrity]] including [[Kuwait]] and [[Kh\u016bzest\u0101n Province|Khuzestan]]. Historical figures of this movement include the pre-Ba'athist leader of Iraq [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] and his government.\n* Iraqi [[Salafi]] [[Islamism|Islamists]], the indigenous armed followers of the Salafi movement, as well as any remnants of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Ansar al-Islam]]: individuals with a Salafi-only policy opposed to non-Salafis though not aligned to one specific ethnic group. Though opposed to the U.S.-led invasion, these groups are not wholly sympathetic towards the former Ba'ath Party as its members included non-Salafis.\n* [[Shi'a]] militias, including the southern, [[Iran]]-linked [[Badr Organization]], the [[Mahdi Army]], and the central-Iraq followers of [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]. These groups neither advocate the dominance of a single ethnic group, nor the traditional ideologies behind the Iraqi state (e.g. these particular Shi'as do not support the capture of Khuzestan or other border areas with Iran, but rather promote warm relations with Iran's Shi'a government).\n* Foreign Islamist volunteers, including those often linked to [[al Qaeda]] and largely driven by the Salafi/Wahhabi doctrine (the two preceding categories are often lumped as \"[[jihad]]ists\");\n* Possibly some socialist revolutionaries (such as the [[Iraqi Armed Revolutionary Resistance]], which claimed one attack in 2007).\n* [[Non-violent resistance]] groups and political parties (not part of the armed insurgency).\n\n=== Arab Nationalist ===\n==== Ba'athists ====\n{{Further|Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region}}\n[[File:Flag of the Ba'ath Party.svg|thumb|[[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] flag]]\nThe Ba'athists include former [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] officials, the [[Fedayeen Saddam]], and some former agents of the Iraqi intelligence elements and security services, such as the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service|Mukhabarat]] and the [[Special Security Organization]]. Their goal, at least before the capture of Saddam Hussein, was the restoration of the former Ba'athist government to power. The pre-war organization of the Ba'ath Party and its militias as a cellular{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} structure aided the continued pro-Saddam resistance after the fall of Baghdad, and Iraqi intelligence operatives may have developed a plan for [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] following the toppling of Saddam Hussein from power.\n\nFollowing Saddam's capture, the Ba'athist movement largely faded; its surviving factions were increasingly shifting to either nationalist factions (Iraqi, though not Pan-Arab, such as the ideology of the pre-Ba'athist regime), or Islamist (Sunni or Shia, depending on the actual faith of the individual, though Ba'ath Party policy had been secular, and many of its members were atheist).\n\nAs the goal of restoring the Ba'ath Party to power was seemingly out of reach, the alternative solution appeared to be to join forces with organisations who opposed the U.S.-led invasion. Many former Ba'athists had adopted an [[Islamist]] fa\u00e7ade to attract more credibility within the country, and perhaps gain support from outside Iraq. Others, especially following the January 2005 elections, became more interested in politics.<!-- commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Fedayeen-Saddam.jpg|thumb|Fedayeen Saddam, irregular soldiers loyal to the former Iraqi Ba'athist regime]] -->\n\nThe fall of Baghdad effectively ended the existence of the [[Fedayeen Saddam]] as an organized paramilitary. Several of its members died during the war. A large number survived, however, and were willing to carry on the fight even after the fall of Saddam Hussein from power. Many former members joined guerrilla organizations that began to form to resist the U.S-led coalition in Iraq. By June, an insurgency was underway in central and northern Iraq, especially in an area known as the [[Sunni Triangle]]. Some units of the Fedayeen also continued to operate independently of other insurgent organizations in the Sunni areas of Iraq.

After the war ended in 1988, the organization remained in Iran until Saddam Hussein was overthrown during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

One particular document, which was apparently written after he lost power, appeared to be a directive to his Ba'athist loyalists warning them to be wary of [[Islamist]] [[mujahideen]] and other foreign Arabs entering the country to join the insurgency. The directive supposedly shows Saddam having concerns that foreign fighters would not share the same objectives as Ba'ath loyalists (i.e. the eventual return of Saddam to power and the restoration of his regime). A U.S. official commenting on the document stressed that while Saddam urged his followers to be cautious in their dealings with other Arab fighters, he did not order them to avoid contact or rule out co-operation. [[Bruce Hoffman]], a Washington counter-terrorism expert stated that the existence of the document underscores the fact that \"this is an insurgency cut of many different cloths...[and] everybody's jockeying for their position of power in the future Iraq.\" Many experts believe that fighters from other countries who have flocked to Iraq to join the insurgents are motivated by animosity toward the United States and the desire to install an Islamic state in place of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]]'s secular [[regime]].<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/15/1073877963219.html Saddam warning on Islamist forces] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428222223/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/15/1073877963219.html |date=28 April 2008}}, ''[[The Age]]'', 16 January 2004.</ref>\n\nForeign fighters are mostly Arabs from neighboring countries, who have entered Iraq, primarily through the porous desert borders of Syria and Saudi Arabia, to assist the Iraqi insurgency.

It is generally believed that most are freelance fighters, but a few members of [[Al-Qaeda]] and the related group [[Ansar al-Islam]] are suspected of infiltrating into the Sunni areas of Iraq through the mountainous northeastern border with [[Iran]]. The United States and its allies point to Jordanian-born Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader [[Abu&nbsp;Musab&nbsp;al-Zarqawi]] as the key player in this group.

Heavy guerrilla activity also takes place around the cities of Mosul and [[Tal Afar]] in the north, as well as the \"[[Triangle of Death (Iraq)|Triangle of Death]]\" south of Baghdad, which includes the \"-iya\" cities of Iskandariya, Mahmudiya, Latifiya, and Yusufiya. Lesser activity takes place in several other areas of the country. The insurgents are believed to maintain a key supply line stretching from Syria through al-Qaim and along the Euphrates to Baghdad and central Iraq, the Iraqi equivalent of the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]]. A second \"ratline\" runs from the Syrian border through Tal Afar to Mosul.\n[[File:Iraqcontrol.JPG|thumb|right|Provincial control of Iraq in September 2011 {{legend|green|Coalition control}}]]\nAlthough estimates of the total number of Iraqi guerrillas varies by group and fluctuates under changing political climate, the latest assessments put the present number at between 3,000 and 7,000 fighters along with numerous supporters and facilitators throughout the Sunni Arab community. At various points U.S. forces provided estimates on the number of fighters in specific regions. A few are provided here (although these numbers almost certainly have fluctuated):\n* Fallujah (mid-2004): 2,000\u20135,000 In a November 2004 operation, the Fallujah insurgency has been destroyed or dispersed, but had staged a comeback in 2005, albeit not to former strength, in the course of 2005\u20132008 the remainder of the insurgency was defeated in Fallujah and the rest of Al-Anbar province.\n* [[Samarra]] (August 2011): 1,000+\n* [[Baquba]] (August 2011 ): 1,000+\n* Baghdad (August 2011): 2,000+\nGuerilla forces operate in many of the cities and towns of [[al-Anbar]] province, due to mostly ineffective Iraqi security forces in this area. There was extensive guerrilla activity in [[Ramadi]], the capital of the province, as well as [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qa'im]], the first stop on an insurgent movement route between Iraq and Syria. In 2006, reports suggested that the Anbar capital Ramadi had largely fallen under insurgent control along with most of the Anbar region, and that as a result the United States had sent an extra 3,500 marines to reestablish control of the region. In the early part of 2007 the insurgency suffered serious setbacks in Ramadi after they were defeated in the Second Battle of Ramadi in the fall of 2006. With the help of the [[Anbar Salvation Council]], incidents fell from an average of 30 attacks per day in December 2006 to an average of fewer than four in April 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-kidcops7may07,1,648855.story?coll=la-news-a_section |title=A ragtag solution with real results|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=7 May 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2010 |first=Chris |last=Kraul |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605161954/http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-kidcops7may07%2C1%2C648855.story?coll=la-news-a_section |archivedate= 5 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nBaghdad is still one of the most violent regions of the country, even after the 2007 troop surge more than two-thirds of the violence that takes place in Iraq happens in Baghdad even though the Iraqi Government is in firm control of the entire city.

She expects Warner to propose, but he breaks up with her instead. He intends to go to Harvard Law School and become a successful politician, and believes that Elle is not \"serious\" enough for that kind of life. Elle believes she can win Warner back if she shows herself capable of achieving the same things. After months of studying, Elle scores a 179 on the [[Law School Admission Test]] and, combined with her 4.0 GPA, is accepted to [[Harvard Law]].\n\nUpon arriving at Harvard, Elle's [[Southern California|SoCal]] personality is a complete contrast to her [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] classmates, who refuse to take her seriously. Elle soon encounters Warner, but discovers he is engaged to another classmate, his old girlfriend Vivian Kensington. The snobby Vivian sees Elle as a fool and constantly treats her as such. Later, Elle tells Warner that she intends to apply for one of her professor's internships,  but Warner tells her that she is wasting her time because she simply isn't smart enough. It is here when Elle realizes that Warner will never take her back or take her seriously, and finds motivation to prove herself by working hard and demonstrating her understanding of the subject.\n\nThe following semester, Professor Callahan, the school's most respected teacher, decides to take on some first-year interns to help with a high-profile case. Among those chosen are Elle, Warner, and Vivian. Callahan is defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, who is one of Elle's role models. Accused of murdering her husband, Brooke is unwilling to produce an alibi (she later reveals to Elle that she was having liposuction, which Elle promises not to disclose). Vivian earns a new respect for Elle, and even reveals that Warner couldn't get into Harvard without his father's help. Emmett Richmond, Callahan's junior partner, has also taken notice of Elle's potential. One night, Callahan attempts to seduce Elle, who now believes that is the reason why she got the internship. Devastated, she quits and nearly returns home to California, telling Emmett what happened. When Emmett explains how Callahan's behavior caused Elle to quit her internship, Brooke fires Callahan and replaces him with Elle (under the guidance of Emmett, as she is only a law student, citing a Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that law students may represent clients as long as they do so under the supervision of a licensed attorney). Elle begins to cross-examine Brooke's step-daughter Chutney, and notices important inconsistencies in her story: Chutney testified that she was home during her father's murder but did not hear the gunshot because she was in the shower after getting her hair permed that morning. Elle says that washing permed hair within the first 24 hours would deactivate the [[ammonium thioglycolate]], and points out that Chutney's curls are still intact. With her story falling apart, Chutney confesses that she had killed her father by accident, but she actually  intended to kill Brooke because she hated the fact that her father married someone who was the same age as her.\n\nAfter the trial, Warner approaches Elle and asks her to take him back, since she has proven herself. Elle rejects him, realizing that he is shallow and a \"complete bonehead\". She and Vivian, however, become good friends \u2013 especially after she dumps Warner. Two years later, Elle gives the graduation speech. Emmett has started his own law firm and has been dating Elle for two years, with plans to propose to her later that night.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Elle Woods]]\n* [[Moonie (dog)|Moonie]] as Bruiser Woods\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Emmett Richmond\n* [[Selma Blair]] as Vivian Kensington\n* [[Matthew Davis]] as Warner Huntington III\n* [[Victor Garber]] as Professor Callahan\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Paulette Bonafont\u00e9\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Professor Stromwell\n* [[Ali Larter]] as Brooke Taylor-Windham\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Margot\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] as Serena McGuire\n* [[Oz Perkins]] as David Kidney\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Chutney Windham\n* [[Bruce Thomas (actor)|Bruce Thomas]] as UPS Guy\n* [[Meredith Scott Lynn]] as Enid Wexler\n* [[Wayne Federman]] as Harvard Admissions Counselor\n* [[Raquel Welch]] as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark\n* [[Greg Serano]] as Enrique Salvatore\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe film is based upon the [[Legally Blonde (novel)|book of the same name]] by [[Amanda Brown (novelist)|Amanda Brown]], who built the story upon her real life experiences as a blonde attending [[Stanford Law School]], while being obsessed with fashion and beauty, reading ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine, and frequently clashing with the personalities of her fellow peers.<ref name=\"sf-chronicle\">{{cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/magazine/article/Blonde-Ambition-Author-Amanda-Brown-marvels-at-2565659.php |title=Blonde Ambition / Author Amanda Brown marvels at the industry surrounding 'Legally Blonde' |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2003-07-13 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nBrown said that when she first arrived to Stanford Law, she discovered she had made a big mistake. \"I was in my first week of law school, in 1993, and I saw this flyer for \"The Women of Stanford Law,\" so I was like, \"I'll go and meet some nice girls.

She expects Warner to propose, but he breaks up with her instead. He intends to go to Harvard Law School and become a successful politician, and believes that Elle is not \"serious\" enough for that kind of life. Elle believes she can win Warner back if she shows herself capable of achieving the same things. After months of studying, Elle scores a 179 on the [[Law School Admission Test]] and, combined with her 4.0 GPA, is accepted to [[Harvard Law]].\n\nUpon arriving at Harvard, Elle's [[Southern California|SoCal]] personality is a complete contrast to her [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] classmates, who refuse to take her seriously. Elle soon encounters Warner, but discovers he is engaged to another classmate, his old girlfriend Vivian Kensington. The snobby Vivian sees Elle as a fool and constantly treats her as such. Later, Elle tells Warner that she intends to apply for one of her professor's internships,  but Warner tells her that she is wasting her time because she simply isn't smart enough. It is here when Elle realizes that Warner will never take her back or take her seriously, and finds motivation to prove herself by working hard and demonstrating her understanding of the subject.\n\nThe following semester, Professor Callahan, the school's most respected teacher, decides to take on some first-year interns to help with a high-profile case. Among those chosen are Elle, Warner, and Vivian. Callahan is defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, who is one of Elle's role models. Accused of murdering her husband, Brooke is unwilling to produce an alibi (she later reveals to Elle that she was having liposuction, which Elle promises not to disclose). Vivian earns a new respect for Elle, and even reveals that Warner couldn't get into Harvard without his father's help. Emmett Richmond, Callahan's junior partner, has also taken notice of Elle's potential. One night, Callahan attempts to seduce Elle, who now believes that is the reason why she got the internship. Devastated, she quits and nearly returns home to California, telling Emmett what happened. When Emmett explains how Callahan's behavior caused Elle to quit her internship, Brooke fires Callahan and replaces him with Elle (under the guidance of Emmett, as she is only a law student, citing a Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that law students may represent clients as long as they do so under the supervision of a licensed attorney). Elle begins to cross-examine Brooke's step-daughter Chutney, and notices important inconsistencies in her story: Chutney testified that she was home during her father's murder but did not hear the gunshot because she was in the shower after getting her hair permed that morning. Elle says that washing permed hair within the first 24 hours would deactivate the [[ammonium thioglycolate]], and points out that Chutney's curls are still intact. With her story falling apart, Chutney confesses that she had killed her father by accident, but she actually  intended to kill Brooke because she hated the fact that her father married someone who was the same age as her.\n\nAfter the trial, Warner approaches Elle and asks her to take him back, since she has proven herself. Elle rejects him, realizing that he is shallow and a \"complete bonehead\". She and Vivian, however, become good friends \u2013 especially after she dumps Warner. Two years later, Elle gives the graduation speech. Emmett has started his own law firm and has been dating Elle for two years, with plans to propose to her later that night.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Elle Woods]]\n* [[Moonie (dog)|Moonie]] as Bruiser Woods\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Emmett Richmond\n* [[Selma Blair]] as Vivian Kensington\n* [[Matthew Davis]] as Warner Huntington III\n* [[Victor Garber]] as Professor Callahan\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Paulette Bonafont\u00e9\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Professor Stromwell\n* [[Ali Larter]] as Brooke Taylor-Windham\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Margot\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] as Serena McGuire\n* [[Oz Perkins]] as David Kidney\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Chutney Windham\n* [[Bruce Thomas (actor)|Bruce Thomas]] as UPS Guy\n* [[Meredith Scott Lynn]] as Enid Wexler\n* [[Wayne Federman]] as Harvard Admissions Counselor\n* [[Raquel Welch]] as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark\n* [[Greg Serano]] as Enrique Salvatore\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe film is based upon the [[Legally Blonde (novel)|book of the same name]] by [[Amanda Brown (novelist)|Amanda Brown]], who built the story upon her real life experiences as a blonde attending [[Stanford Law School]], while being obsessed with fashion and beauty, reading ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine, and frequently clashing with the personalities of her fellow peers.<ref name=\"sf-chronicle\">{{cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/magazine/article/Blonde-Ambition-Author-Amanda-Brown-marvels-at-2565659.php |title=Blonde Ambition / Author Amanda Brown marvels at the industry surrounding 'Legally Blonde' |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2003-07-13 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nBrown said that when she first arrived to Stanford Law, she discovered she had made a big mistake. \"I was in my first week of law school, in 1993, and I saw this flyer for \"The Women of Stanford Law,\" so I was like, \"I'll go and meet some nice girls.

The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally fought war which included the capture of the Iraqi capital of [[Baghdad]] by American forces with the implicit assistance of the United Kingdom alongside Australia and Poland.\n\n160,000 troops were sent by the Coalition into Iraq, during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. About 130,000 were sent from the USA alone, with about 28,000 British soldiers, Australia (2,000), and Poland (194).

The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into [[Basra Governorate|Basra Province]] from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the [[Persian Gulf]] to secure [[Basra]] and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173rd Airborne Brigade]] was [[Operation Northern Delay|airdropped]] near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]], where they joined forces with [[Kurds|Kurdish]] rebels and fought several actions against the [[Iraqi Army]] to secure the northern part of the country.\n\nThe main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of [[Tikrit]] on 15 April. [[President of Iraq|Iraqi president]] Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the [[military occupation]] period.\n\n=== Anti-Coalition insurgency ===\n{{Main|Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201311)|Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201306)}}\nInvading U.S.-led forces were unable to immediately fill the power vacuum caused by the sudden collapse of a highly centralized state authority, resulting in weeks of virtual anarchy. The rampant looting during this time period, and the inability of U.S.-led forces to control the situation, led to Iraqi resentment. Additionally, the unexpectedly quick implosion of Saddam Hussein's regime meant that the invading forces never engaged and decisively defeated his army in any major battle; the Iraqi army forces simply melted away, often with their weapons, back to their homes. Another cause of resentment was the lack of immediate humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts for Iraqis suffering from the invasion, the long-term effects of the repression and mismanagement of the Saddam Hussein regime, and international sanctions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\">Abdullah, T.A.J., 2006, ''Dictatorship, Imperialism & Chaos: Iraq since 1989'', London, Zed Books</ref> A number of factions felt suspicious of long-term American intentions; the conduct of some American soldiers also served to heighten tensions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/> The de-Ba'athification Commission set up by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]], the nature of selection of the Governing Council, and other policy decisions were interpreted by Sunni Arabs as actions intended to single out their community for discrimination; this encouraged the beginnings of sectarian tensions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/>\n\nIn May 2003, after the Iraqi conventional forces had been defeated and disbanded, the U.S. military noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on U.S. troops in various regions of the so-called \"[[Sunni Triangle]]\", especially in [[Baghdad]] and in the regions around [[Fallujah]] and [[Tikrit]]. The U.S. military blamed the attacks on remnants of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] and the [[Fedayeen Saddam]] militia. Tensions between U.S. forces and the residents of Fallujah were especially severe, with crowd riots and small skirmishes commonplace.\n\nMembers of insurgent groups came from a variety of sources. Former members of the security services of the Ba'ath regime, former military officers, and some other Ba'ath Party members are cited as members of insurgent groups; indeed, these elements formed the primary backbone of the nascent insurgency.<ref>Hashim, A.S., 2003, The Insurgency in Iraq, ''Small Wars and Insurgencies'', Volume 14(3), pp 1-22</ref> Initially, most former members of the Ba'ath Party and former Iraqi soldiers expressed a willingness to compromise with the Coalition forces. However, many lost their jobs and pensions with the [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2|disbanding of the Iraqi army]] by [[Paul Bremer]]; this, and the unwillingness of the Coalition Provisional Authority to negotiate with former Ba'ath elements, provided impetus for the initial insurgency. While 80% of the army officers were Sunni, the rank and file of the regular army was 80% Shia.<ref>Gaub, 2011, \"Rebuilding Armed Forces: Learning From Iraq And Lebanon\", ''Strategic Studies Institute'', pp 3</ref> Prisoners let out of prison by [[Saddam Hussein]] before his disappearance provided another source both of insurgent recruits and of organized crime factions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/> Finally, as O'Hanlan says, the porous borders of Iraq and the subsequent foreign insurgents also bolstered the insurgency.<ref>O'Hanlan, M.E., 2005, Iraq Without A Plan, ''Policy Review'', Issue 128, pp 33-45</ref>\n\nResistance to U.S.-led forces would not for long be confined to the Sunni regions of Iraq. Between 2003 and 2004, Shiite dissatisfaction with the occupation, especially among the urban poor, had been gradually increasing for some of the same reasons it had been among the Sunnis: the perception that the Coalition had failed to deliver on its promises and a nationalist dissatisfaction with foreign occupation. Many young men without jobs or prospects and who had lost faith with the promises of the U.S. began to become drawn to Shiite religious radicalism, especially of the brand advocated by the cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]. Sadr's distinguished family background, and his fiery anti-occupation rhetoric and calls for the implementation of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], caused him to emerge as the leader of this portion of Iraqi Shiite society. In June 2003, after being rejected from a spot on the Iraqi Governing Council, he had created a militia known as the [[Peace Companies|Mahdi Army]], whose mission he said was to help keep order and cleanse Iraq of \"evil.\" Since that point, the U.S. had regarded him as a threat, but was divided on whether or not to proceed with a crackdown. Eventually, as Sadr's rhetoric heated and his militia paraded through Sadr City in what seemed like a challenge to the United States, they decided to begin to squeeze his movement.

That, combined with his steadily decreasing political prospects for success within the U.S.-backed interim government, pushed Sadr to decide for armed revolt.\n\nOn April 4, the Mahdi Army was directed to begin launching attacks on coalition targets and to seize control from the nascent U.S.-trained Iraqi security forces. The Mahdi Army, which by then numbered from 3,000 to 10,000 men, organized quickly escalating violent riots and then a coordinated assault, surprising coalition and Iraqi forces and seizing control of [[Najaf]], [[Kufa]], [[Kut|al-Kut]], and parts of Baghdad and southern cities like [[Nasiriyah]], [[Amarah]], and [[Basra]]. A widespread collapse of the Iraqi security forces ensued, with most deserting or defecting to the rebels rather than fighting. Soon, combat was erupting in many urban centers of southern and central portions of Iraq as U.S. forces attempted to maintain control and prepared for a counteroffensive.\n\t\t\nAt the same time, the Sunni insurgency was rapidly intensifying. On March 31, 2004, four [[private military company|private military contractor]]s working for the U.S. military were killed and subsequently mutilated by insurgents and a crowd of residents in the city of Fallujah, long a particularly troublesome center of Sunni resistance to the U.S. presence. On the same day, 5 U.S. soldiers were killed by a large IED on a road a few miles outside of the city. The attacks took place as the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] were taking over responsibility for [[Al Anbar Governorate|al-Anbar province]], in which Fallujah is located, from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. The intended [[US Marine Corps|Marine]] strategy of [[patrolling|patrols]], less aggressive raids, [[humanitarian aid]], and close cooperation with local leaders was quickly suspended and the U.S. decided that it was time for a major assault to clear the city of insurgents. On April 4, U.S. and Iraqi forces launched [[First Battle of Fallujah|Operation Vigilant Resolve]] to retake the city, which had clearly fallen completely into rebel hands. They met very stiff and well-organized resistance from the guerrillas. After three days of fighting with the U.S. Marines, the insurgents still held three-quarters of the city. Cases of widespread reach and planning, suggesting national insurgent coordination, were noted. Hundreds of insurgents cut the road between Fallujah and Baghdad to the east, while west of Fallujah in [[Ramadi]], over 150 insurgents launched an offensive against U.S. Marine positions. A similar attack followed, conducted by about 150 insurgents, against U.S. Marines near the Syrian border in [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qaim]]. The assaults were beaten back, but the U.S. toll from the combined attacks numbered in the dozens. Political pressure began to build on the United States and the Governing Council of Iraq as the hospital of Fallujah continued to report high numbers of civilian casualties, inflaming further the Iraqi people and Muslim world in general. After two weeks of fighting, the U.S. Marines were on the verge of capturing, but had not yet taken central control of, the city of Fallujah. Pentagon leaders, fearing that continuing the effort to capture the city might further inflame a larger revolt against Coalition authority, pulled back the forces. The Marines were ordered to stand-down and cordon off the city on April 30, where they would remain in a perimeter around the city for the following six months. A compromise on April 30 was reached in order to ensure security within Fallujah itself by creating the \"Fallujah Brigade\", a unit that drew from former members of Iraq's Army, local volunteers, and even the insurgents themselves. The unit's formation was part of a truce negotiation. This unit was to act under the control of the Coalition Provisional Authority, patrol alongside the Iraqi Police and National Guardsmen but maintain its autonomy. The Fallujah Brigade had many former Saddam loyalists. From various reports, Brigade members re-integrated themselves into the insurgent outfits that dominated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&itemid=977 |title=Fallujah Brigade to Disband, Join Resistance in Control of City |access-date=2017-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213203531/http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&itemid=977 |archive-date=2004-12-13 |url-status=live}}</ref> The city remained under the control of insurgent forces. Reportedly, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]'s organization was among the several that exercised some authority in the area.\n\nBy the end of the spring uprising, the cities of Fallujah, [[Samarra]], [[Baqubah|Baquba]], and Ramadi had been left under Sunni guerrilla control with American patrols in the cities ceased. The insurgency had undergone another major shift, as insurgent organizations now had safe havens in cities such as Fallujah to develop and coordinate with each other. Zarqawi's group and its allies were in a period of uneasy cooperation with other insurgent groups dominated by nationalist and Ba'athist agendas, although the groups increasingly came into competition for territory within Sunni insurgent-controlled areas. U.S. forces launched only occasional armored forays into Samarra and Baquba, while about half a dozen small forts were maintained by the U.S. Marines in Ramadi, with the surrounding territory in the city controlled by rebels. American ground forces remained outside of Fallujah, though regular air strikes were conducted on alleged safehouses of [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's followers]] in the city. With the battle for Fallujah over, the Sunni insurgency continued against the U.S. forces remaining outside these cities as the guerrillas resumed their tactics of using IED's and mortars to attack U.S. forces indirectly, for the most part avoiding direct combat.\n\nMeanwhile, the fighting continued in the Shiite south. Over the next three months, over 1,500 Mahdi Army militiamen, several hundred civilians, and dozens of coalition soldiers were killed as the U.S. gradually took back the southern cities. On June 6, a truce was reached, temporarily ending the fighting.\n\nOn June 28, 2004, the occupation was formally ended by the Coalition, which transferred power to a new [[Politics of Iraq|Iraqi government]] led by [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Ayad Allawi]]. Although many Iraqis were optimistic about the government, militants saw it as little more than an American puppet and continued the fight unabated. On July 18, guerrillas offered a $285,000 reward for Allawi's assassination.\n\n=== Sectarian violence ===\n{{Main|Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006\u20132008)}}\nIn February 2006, the [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi jihadist]] organization [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn]] (also known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq) [[2006 al-Askari mosque bombing|bombed]] one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam - the [[Al-Askari Shrine|al-Askari Mosque]] in [[Samarra]].

On 16 October 2017, the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] ignored a deadline given by Iraq to withdraw. This led to [[Battle of Kirkuk (2017)]], and Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed PMU retaking Kirkuk and its province on 15 October 2017. Within 15 hours, the city of [[Kirkuk]] and the nearby [[K-1 Air Base]], along with surrounding oilfields, were retaken by Iraqi forces. This resulted in the conflict's end.\n\n=== Defeat of ISIL ===\nOn December 9, 2017, the last ISIL-held areas in the al-Jazira Desert were captured by the Iraqi military.

The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally fought war which included the capture of the Iraqi capital of [[Baghdad]] by American forces with the implicit assistance of the United Kingdom alongside Australia and Poland.\n\n160,000 troops were sent by the Coalition into Iraq, during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. About 130,000 were sent from the USA alone, with about 28,000 British soldiers, Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). [[Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq|36 other countries]] were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in [[Kuwait]] by 18 February.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html |title=U.S. has 100,000 troops in Kuwait |publisher=CNN |date=18 February 2003 |accessdate=29 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108211421/http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html |archive-date=8 November 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The coalition forces also received support from [[Peshmerga|Kurdish irregulars]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].\n\nThe invasion was preceded by an [[airstrike]] on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 20 March 2003. The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into [[Basra Governorate|Basra Province]] from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the [[Persian Gulf]] to secure [[Basra]] and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173rd Airborne Brigade]] was [[Operation Northern Delay|airdropped]] near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]], where they joined forces with [[Kurds|Kurdish]] rebels and fought several actions against the [[Iraqi Army]] to secure the northern part of the country.\n\nThe main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of [[Tikrit]] on 15 April. [[President of Iraq|Iraqi president]] Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the [[military occupation]] period.\n\n=== Anti-Coalition insurgency ===\n{{Main|Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201311)|Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201306)}}\nInvading U.S.-led forces were unable to immediately fill the power vacuum caused by the sudden collapse of a highly centralized state authority, resulting in weeks of virtual anarchy. The rampant looting during this time period, and the inability of U.S.-led forces to control the situation, led to Iraqi resentment. Additionally, the unexpectedly quick implosion of Saddam Hussein's regime meant that the invading forces never engaged and decisively defeated his army in any major battle; the Iraqi army forces simply melted away, often with their weapons, back to their homes. Another cause of resentment was the lack of immediate humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts for Iraqis suffering from the invasion, the long-term effects of the repression and mismanagement of the Saddam Hussein regime, and international sanctions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\">Abdullah, T.A.J., 2006, ''Dictatorship, Imperialism & Chaos: Iraq since 1989'', London, Zed Books</ref> A number of factions felt suspicious of long-term American intentions; the conduct of some American soldiers also served to heighten tensions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/> The de-Ba'athification Commission set up by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]], the nature of selection of the Governing Council, and other policy decisions were interpreted by Sunni Arabs as actions intended to single out their community for discrimination; this encouraged the beginnings of sectarian tensions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/>\n\nIn May 2003, after the Iraqi conventional forces had been defeated and disbanded, the U.S. military noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on U.S. troops in various regions of the so-called \"[[Sunni Triangle]]\", especially in [[Baghdad]] and in the regions around [[Fallujah]] and [[Tikrit]]. The U.S. military blamed the attacks on remnants of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] and the [[Fedayeen Saddam]] militia. Tensions between U.S. forces and the residents of Fallujah were especially severe, with crowd riots and small skirmishes commonplace.\n\nMembers of insurgent groups came from a variety of sources. Former members of the security services of the Ba'ath regime, former military officers, and some other Ba'ath Party members are cited as members of insurgent groups; indeed, these elements formed the primary backbone of the nascent insurgency.<ref>Hashim, A.S., 2003, The Insurgency in Iraq, ''Small Wars and Insurgencies'', Volume 14(3), pp 1-22</ref> Initially, most former members of the Ba'ath Party and former Iraqi soldiers expressed a willingness to compromise with the Coalition forces. However, many lost their jobs and pensions with the [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2|disbanding of the Iraqi army]] by [[Paul Bremer]]; this, and the unwillingness of the Coalition Provisional Authority to negotiate with former Ba'ath elements, provided impetus for the initial insurgency. While 80% of the army officers were Sunni, the rank and file of the regular army was 80% Shia.<ref>Gaub, 2011, \"Rebuilding Armed Forces: Learning From Iraq And Lebanon\", ''Strategic Studies Institute'', pp 3</ref> Prisoners let out of prison by [[Saddam Hussein]] before his disappearance provided another source both of insurgent recruits and of organized crime factions.<ref name=\"Abdullah, T.A.J. 2006\"/> Finally, as O'Hanlan says, the porous borders of Iraq and the subsequent foreign insurgents also bolstered the insurgency.<ref>O'Hanlan, M.E., 2005, Iraq Without A Plan, ''Policy Review'', Issue 128, pp 33-45</ref>\n\nResistance to U.S.-led forces would not for long be confined to the Sunni regions of Iraq. Between 2003 and 2004, Shiite dissatisfaction with the occupation, especially among the urban poor, had been gradually increasing for some of the same reasons it had been among the Sunnis: the perception that the Coalition had failed to deliver on its promises and a nationalist dissatisfaction with foreign occupation. Many young men without jobs or prospects and who had lost faith with the promises of the U.S. began to become drawn to Shiite religious radicalism, especially of the brand advocated by the cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]. Sadr's distinguished family background, and his fiery anti-occupation rhetoric and calls for the implementation of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], caused him to emerge as the leader of this portion of Iraqi Shiite society. In June 2003, after being rejected from a spot on the Iraqi Governing Council, he had created a militia known as the [[Peace Companies|Mahdi Army]], whose mission he said was to help keep order and cleanse Iraq of \"evil.\" Since that point, the U.S. had regarded him as a threat, but was divided on whether or not to proceed with a crackdown. Eventually, as Sadr's rhetoric heated and his militia paraded through Sadr City in what seemed like a challenge to the United States, they decided to begin to squeeze his movement. On March 29, they moved to close Sadr's newspaper<ref>{{cite web|title=Who is Moqtada Sadr?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57949-2004Apr7.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=28 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429024541/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57949-2004Apr7.html|archive-date=29 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> known as \"al-Hawza\" and arrested one of his aides on murder charges. That, combined with his steadily decreasing political prospects for success within the U.S.-backed interim government, pushed Sadr to decide for armed revolt.\n\nOn April 4, the Mahdi Army was directed to begin launching attacks on coalition targets and to seize control from the nascent U.S.-trained Iraqi security forces. The Mahdi Army, which by then numbered from 3,000 to 10,000 men, organized quickly escalating violent riots and then a coordinated assault, surprising coalition and Iraqi forces and seizing control of [[Najaf]], [[Kufa]], [[Kut|al-Kut]], and parts of Baghdad and southern cities like [[Nasiriyah]], [[Amarah]], and [[Basra]]. A widespread collapse of the Iraqi security forces ensued, with most deserting or defecting to the rebels rather than fighting. Soon, combat was erupting in many urban centers of southern and central portions of Iraq as U.S. forces attempted to maintain control and prepared for a counteroffensive.\n\t\t\nAt the same time, the Sunni insurgency was rapidly intensifying. On March 31, 2004, four [[private military company|private military contractor]]s working for the U.S. military were killed and subsequently mutilated by insurgents and a crowd of residents in the city of Fallujah, long a particularly troublesome center of Sunni resistance to the U.S. presence. On the same day, 5 U.S. soldiers were killed by a large IED on a road a few miles outside of the city. The attacks took place as the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] were taking over responsibility for [[Al Anbar Governorate|al-Anbar province]], in which Fallujah is located, from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. The intended [[US Marine Corps|Marine]] strategy of [[patrolling|patrols]], less aggressive raids, [[humanitarian aid]], and close cooperation with local leaders was quickly suspended and the U.S. decided that it was time for a major assault to clear the city of insurgents. On April 4, U.S. and Iraqi forces launched [[First Battle of Fallujah|Operation Vigilant Resolve]] to retake the city, which had clearly fallen completely into rebel hands. They met very stiff and well-organized resistance from the guerrillas. After three days of fighting with the U.S. Marines, the insurgents still held three-quarters of the city. Cases of widespread reach and planning, suggesting national insurgent coordination, were noted. Hundreds of insurgents cut the road between Fallujah and Baghdad to the east, while west of Fallujah in [[Ramadi]], over 150 insurgents launched an offensive against U.S. Marine positions. A similar attack followed, conducted by about 150 insurgents, against U.S. Marines near the Syrian border in [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qaim]]. The assaults were beaten back, but the U.S. toll from the combined attacks numbered in the dozens. Political pressure began to build on the United States and the Governing Council of Iraq as the hospital of Fallujah continued to report high numbers of civilian casualties, inflaming further the Iraqi people and Muslim world in general. After two weeks of fighting, the U.S. Marines were on the verge of capturing, but had not yet taken central control of, the city of Fallujah. Pentagon leaders, fearing that continuing the effort to capture the city might further inflame a larger revolt against Coalition authority, pulled back the forces. The Marines were ordered to stand-down and cordon off the city on April 30, where they would remain in a perimeter around the city for the following six months. A compromise on April 30 was reached in order to ensure security within Fallujah itself by creating the \"Fallujah Brigade\", a unit that drew from former members of Iraq's Army, local volunteers, and even the insurgents themselves. The unit's formation was part of a truce negotiation. This unit was to act under the control of the Coalition Provisional Authority, patrol alongside the Iraqi Police and National Guardsmen but maintain its autonomy. The Fallujah Brigade had many former Saddam loyalists. From various reports, Brigade members re-integrated themselves into the insurgent outfits that dominated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&itemid=977 |title=Fallujah Brigade to Disband, Join Resistance in Control of City |access-date=2017-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213203531/http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&itemid=977 |archive-date=2004-12-13 |url-status=live}}</ref> The city remained under the control of insurgent forces. Reportedly, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]'s organization was among the several that exercised some authority in the area.\n\nBy the end of the spring uprising, the cities of Fallujah, [[Samarra]], [[Baqubah|Baquba]], and Ramadi had been left under Sunni guerrilla control with American patrols in the cities ceased. The insurgency had undergone another major shift, as insurgent organizations now had safe havens in cities such as Fallujah to develop and coordinate with each other. Zarqawi's group and its allies were in a period of uneasy cooperation with other insurgent groups dominated by nationalist and Ba'athist agendas, although the groups increasingly came into competition for territory within Sunni insurgent-controlled areas. U.S. forces launched only occasional armored forays into Samarra and Baquba, while about half a dozen small forts were maintained by the U.S. Marines in Ramadi, with the surrounding territory in the city controlled by rebels. American ground forces remained outside of Fallujah, though regular air strikes were conducted on alleged safehouses of [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's followers]] in the city. With the battle for Fallujah over, the Sunni insurgency continued against the U.S. forces remaining outside these cities as the guerrillas resumed their tactics of using IED's and mortars to attack U.S. forces indirectly, for the most part avoiding direct combat.\n\nMeanwhile, the fighting continued in the Shiite south. Over the next three months, over 1,500 Mahdi Army militiamen, several hundred civilians, and dozens of coalition soldiers were killed as the U.S. gradually took back the southern cities.

In 2019, the book was re-released by Graymalkin Media for the opening of ''[[Ford v Ferrari]]'', a 2019 American sports drama film. The memoir describes his days as a race car driver, the challenges, the victories, and the crashes \u2014 the worst of which he describes as an \u201cexplosion.\u201d The memoir also discusses the genesis for the revolutionary car he created, the [[Shelby Cobra]].\n\n==Shelby the constructor==\n{{main|Shelby American vehicles}}\n[[File:Blue Cobra by Blue Pacific.JPG|thumb|right|1965 [[AC Cobra]] 427 (North America)]]\nShelby states in his book, The Carroll Shelby Story, \"...the longer I went on racing and was around the limited-production factories in Europe, the more I realized that America was missing a big bet, a winning bet...that winning bet I'm talking about was the design and production of an all-purpose, all-American sports or grand touring car that you could drive to market and also race during the weekend...\"  In particular, Shelby wanted to put a 300 [[horsepower|brake horsepower]] [[V8]] on an Austin Healey type [[chassis]], so that it weighed less than 2600 pounds.<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|90\u201393}}\n\nAfter retiring from driving in October 1959 for health reasons,<ref>\"Automobiles\", episode about Ford Motor Company, History Channel</ref> Shelby opened a high-performance driving school and the [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American]] performance equipment and customization company in the Los Angeles area. Shelby became interested in the potential of the [[AC Ace]] chassis, especially after [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] stopped building automobile engines, and the sales with the [[Ford Zephyr engine]] were declining in September 1961.  Shelby contacted Charles Hurlock of AC, who agreed to provide the chassis on credit.  Dave Evans of [[Ford Motor Company]], agreed to provide on credit, the 221-cubic-inch and 260-cubic-inch V8 engines with transmissions.  The new car, called the Carroll Shelby Experimental or CSX0001, would be marketed as the Shelby AC Cobra, then [[AC Cobra]], and eventually, the [[Ford Cobra]].  Production began in March 1962, and 75 cars were sold by the end of the year.  A 100 cars had been built by April 1963, the first 75 with the 260-cubic-inch engine, followed by a 289-cubic-inch engine.  The 427 Cobra prototype was built in Oct. 1964.<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|172\u2013183,190,195}}\n\nShelby started racing his creation in October 1962 at Riverside, with Billy Krause driving the CSX0002.  Racing experience from 1963 indicated that further modifications were necessary to make the Cobra competitive with the Ferrari GT cars; in particular, the AC roadster body needed to be replaced with a lower-drag enclosed coupe body for high-speed circuits.  The result was the [[Shelby Daytona]] Coupe, which took three GT class wins on the 1964 [[World Sportscar Championship]] GT circuit, including Le Mans and the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood, plus the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[United States Road Racing Championship|U.S. GT Championship]].  Then in 1965, Shelby American Cobra won the [[World Sportscar Championship|International Championship for GT Manufacturers]].<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|180,202,208\u2013210,213\u2013214,217,221}}\n\nAfter success with the Daytona Coupe in 1964, Shelby-American became more heavily involved in Ford's [[Ford GT40|GT40]] Sports Prototype racing program, which had experienced disappointing results.  Shelby made changes to running gear, particularly transmissions, to improve reliability, and designed their GT40 Mark II variant around Ford's 7.0-liter engine.  The results paid off spectacularly in 1966, with the Mark II bringing Ford the overall Constructors' title in the World Sportscar Championship, clinched with their 1-2-3 finish at Le Mans.  But Ford could not rest on its laurels in light of Ferrari's determined efforts, and was developing a radical new prototype with a lightweight chassis based on aluminum honeycomb panels.  Shelby was brought in to finalize development of the car after the project experienced setbacks in 1966.  The Mark IV was introduced for the 1967 [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and won handily, then was prepared for Le Mans.  Various misfortunes took Ford out of realistic contention for a repeat title, but the Shelby-American team delivered another record-breaking statement win at Le Mans.  An exclamation point was added to that statement when [[Dan Gurney]] shook and sprayed champagne on the podium, starting a tradition.  The Mark IV was Shelby's last prototype racer, as new limits on engine displacement for that class took all of Ford's high-performance engines out of eligibility.\n\nShelby's early racing successes led to a joint effort of Ford and Shelby-American to produce the Mustang-based [[Shelby GT350]], starting in 1965, then the [[Shelby GT500]], starting in 1967. Shelby produced those cars through 1968, then subsequent cars with the Shelby GT brand were produced in-house by Ford.\n\nAfter parting with Ford, Shelby moved on to help develop performance cars with divisions of the two other [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big 3]] American companies: [[Dodge]], and [[Oldsmobile]].\n\nIn the intervening years, Shelby had a series of ventures start and stop relating to production of \"completion\" Cobras&nbsp;\u2014 cars that were allegedly built using \"leftover\" parts and frames. In the 1960s, the [[FIA]] required entrants (Shelby, Ford, Ferrari, etc.) to produce at least 100 cars for [[homologated]] classes of racing. Shelby simply ordered an insufficient number of cars and skipped a large block of [[Vehicle Identification Number]]s, to create the illusion the company had imported large numbers of cars. Decades later in the 1990s, Carroll alleged that he had found the \"left over\" frames, and began selling cars which were supposedly finally \"completed\". After it was discovered the cars were built from scratch in collaboration with McCluskey, Ltd., they were re-termed \"continuation\" Cobras. The cars are still built to this day, known as the current CSX4000 series of Cobras.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] in 1991, the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/carroll-shelby.html Carroll Shelby] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref> in 1992, the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1992,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319205857/http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/carroll-shelby/126/ Automotive Hall of Fame]</ref> and the [[Diecast Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

The purchase included the Series 1 model, but not the rights to produce the \"Continuation Series\" Shelby Cobras.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shelby-cars.com/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227050433/http://www.shelby-cars.com/index.htm |archivedate=December 27, 2010 |df=mdy }}{{Failed verification|date=January 2011}}</ref> In 2004, after a subsequent bankruptcy by Venture Corporation (unrelated to the acquisition of Shelby American), Carroll Shelby's new company, Shelby Automobiles, Inc., purchased the Series 1 assets for pennies on the dollar.  Included in the asset purchase were enough components to produce several more complete Series 1s.\n\nBecause the 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards certificate had expired, and the cost to re-certify the car was prohibitive, all Series 1's produced after that date were completed as \"component cars\" and delivered with no engine or transmission.  Those \"component car\" models built in 2005 are identified with a seven-digit vehicle identification number (VIN) and were designated with a CSX5000 series serial number. The original 249 were production cars with a seventeen-digit VIN.\n\nThe Series 1 was produced in both supercharged and normally aspirated versions. Supercharged cars were also outfitted by the factory with larger brakes and a heavy duty clutch. Performance is near \"supercar\" category with a [[0 to 60 mph]] time at 4.1 seconds for the supercharged version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.caranddriver.com/files/shelby-series-1.pdf |title=Shelby Series 1 |publisher=Car and Driver |date= |accessdate=27 December 2015}}</ref>  Nicely optioned, Series 1 had power steering, power disc brakes, factory air conditioning, power windows, and an AM/FM/CD audio system. The convertible top folded away out of sight in a compartment located behind the cockpit. Some component cars were sold as roadsters, with no convertible top.\n\n==Ford-Shelby projects==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:Martin Auto Museum-1965 Shelby AC Cobra-2.jpg|200px|thumb|1965 Shelby Cobra dashboard autographed by Carroll Shelby on display in the [[Martin Auto Museum]]]]\nThe new contract between [[Ford Motor Company]] and Carroll Shelby signaled hope for Shelby products built under Ford. In 2004, a new '''[[Ford Shelby Cobra Concept]]''' was shown off at U.S. car shows. Built with a retro body mimicking the 1960s [[AC Cobra|Cobras]] mixed with modern touches, it was based on the [[Ford GT]] chassis (reworked for [[front engine]]/[[rear wheel drive]]) powered with a 6.4&nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] that produced 605&nbsp;hp (451&nbsp;kW). It received overwhelmingly positive press reviews and has won the \"Best In Show\" award at Detroit International Auto Show.\n\nA coupe version of the Shelby Cobra roadster was introduced the following year. The '''[[Ford Shelby GR-1]]''' concept car of 2005. While sporting a completely modern design, it showed a nod to the 1960s [[Shelby Daytona]]. The GR-1, like the Cobra, is based on the GT's chassis. Press reviews for the GR-1 have been positive. The car was featured on the cover of ''[[Motor Trend]]'' and ''[[Car Magazine]]''. The Ford Shelby GR-1 could possibly be built, taking over the [[Ford GT]]'s production line after its production comes to an end.\n\nIn 2005, Carroll Shelby built his first modern Masterpiece, the CSM #00001 V6 Shelby Mustang CS6, to prove to Ford that he could still build high-performance cars, and that he did, with the V6 putting out 380HP it made the V6 Shelby faster than Ford's V8 300HP. Because Ford thought the CS6 would hurt Ford Mustang V8 sales, Ford told Shelby to go with the V8 instead. Few CS6 Shelbys were made by Shelby; consequently these are among the rarest Shelbys in the world.\n\nThe [[Shelby Mustang|Shelby GT500]] was revealed at the [[New York International Auto Show]], and became available in the summer of 2006 as part of the model year 2007 lineup. It was powered by a 5.4 Liter Modular V8, with four-valves-per-cylinder heads borrowed from the $150K Ford GT supercar, an Eaton M122 [[Roots-type supercharger]] and is rated by Ford at {{convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|480|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. It boasts a [[Tremec]] T-6060 [[manual transmission]], reworked [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] geometry, 18-inch wheels, functional aerodynamic body kit, and still retains the [[Live axle|solid rear axle]]. The GT500 starts at an MSRP of $40,930 for the coupe, and $45,755 for the convertible version. Although Carroll Shelby had no hands-on involvement in the design of the car, he did provide Ford and SVT (Special Vehicle Team) input on what would make the car better and convinced Ford to enlist wider rear tires (from 255&nbsp;mm wide to 285&nbsp;mm wide).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nShelby, in cooperation with the [[Hertz Corporation]], produced 500 cars named \"Shelby GT-H\" in 2006. This was a special-edition Ford Mustang GT, available for rental from Hertz. A Ford Racing Performance Group FR1 Power Pack increased the GT's 4.6 L V8 engine to {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The cars included a custom Shelby hood and black and gold body styling, incorporating a gold-plated \"Hertz\" nameplate on both sides.\n\nA consumer version of the Shelby GT-H was available from Shelby through Ford dealers, called the Shelby GT. There were 5,682 vehicles for 2007 and 2,300 for 2008 were built. They had the same engine as the GT-H, but more suspension, appearance and drivetrain upgrades and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. White and black colors were available for 2007 models and grabber orange or vista blue were available for 2008. A convertible was available in 2008 also. An available upgrade from the Shelby factory in Las Vegas were a few different superchargers. It then was called a Shelby GT/SC. All Shelby GTs are shipped with the Shelby serial number (CSM) on the dashboard badge and in the engine compartment, such as 07SGT0001 or 08SGT0001.\n\n==Non-Ford projects==\nIn his later years, Shelby brought several lawsuits against companies making copies of the Cobra body for use on kit cars&nbsp;\u2013 ostensibly for copyright, trademark and patent violations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Despite the litigation, the Cobra kit car industry continues to thrive.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOne of the lawsuits involved the Superformance Brock Coupe, a copy of the original Shelby Daytona Coupe. The Superformance Brock Coupe was designed by [[Pete Brock]], who had also designed the original Daytona Coupe for Shelby. Shelby American sued Superformance after the company had developed and begun production of the Superformance Brock Coupe. Eventually, the litigation was settled, though the terms of the settlement have never been released to the public. As a result of the agreement between the two companies, the product is now known as the Shelby Daytona Coupe, despite being neither designed nor built by Shelby American. Nearly 150 of these new Shelby Daytona Coupes have been built as of February 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 2002, Unique Performance, a company of Farmers Branch, Texas, purchased a license from Carroll Shelby Enterprises to place his name on a series of continuation vintage vehicles. This company specialized in recreating 1960s-style Shelby Mustangs. They purchased used Mustangs and installed updated versions of the Shelby 325-horsepower 302-cubic-inch V8 engine. They also use modern five-speed manual transmissions, brakes, steering, suspension, interiors and entertainment systems. Because Shelby's license was purchased, these cars have Shelby serial numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=\thttp://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/14/muscle-cars-reborn/ |title=Muscle Cars Reborn |publisher=Autoblog.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1967 Ford Mustang Shelby GT-500 Eleanor.jpg|thumb|right|1967 custom Fastback Mustang ''Eleanor'' from the 2000 film ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in Sixty Seconds]]'']]\nIn October 2007, Carroll Shelby ended his licensing agreement with Unique Performance due to numerous issues of customer complaints where vehicles were not delivered.

Like most Ferrari repairs, this was not going to be a cheap, simple fix. At the time, Laughlin was an active participant in the American sports car racing scene and was a close acquaintance of many of the key figures, including fellow Texan Shelby. The two had witnessed a number of V8-powered home-built specials challenge, and often defeat, the best that Europe had to offer. The idea developed that they should build a dual-purpose car based on the solid mechanicals of the Chevrolet Corvette. European-style alloy coachwork could help the chassis finally realize its potential. By chance, Laughlin owned a few Chevrolet dealerships and had a particularly valuable friend in Peter Coltrin, an automotive journalist who had gained an \u201cin\u201d with the influential Italians. Laughlin met with Jim Hall and Carroll Shelby to begin discussing what form their new Italian-American hybrid would take. The general consensus was that they should create a car that offered the best of both worlds \u2013 a Corvette with the distinction, performance and style of a Ferrari, but with the power and reliability of a Chevrolet. The aim was to create a genuine high-performance GT with enough leg and headroom to meet American expectations. Once this was decided, Coltrin put Laughlin in touch with Sergio Scaglietti. With the help of Chevrolet General Manager Ed Cole, three 1959 Corvette chassis were discreetly acquired from the St. Louis Corvette plant before bodies could be fitted \u2013 one was specified with a \u201cfuelie\u201d and a four-speed, the others came with twin four barrels and automatics. During one of his frequent trips through Europe, Laughlin met with Sergio Scaglietti who agreed to produce a small run of bodies for the Corvette chassis. At the time, Scaglietti was busy turning out Ferrari's Tour de France and purpose-built racing cars. The Scaglietti Corvette would follow the lines of the Tour de France, albeit lines adapted to fit the Corvette's larger footprint. In an effort to impress, or perhaps, appease GM management, Laughlin specified a proper Corvette grille. The interior would be similarly hybridized with an intriguing combination of Americana \u2013 Stewart Warner gauges, T-handle parking brake, Corvette shift knob; and classic Italian GT \u2013 a purposeful crackle-finish dashboard, deeply bolstered leather seats and exquisite door hardware. \n[[File:ScagliettiCorvette.JPG|thumb|240px|right|1959 [[Scaglietti]] Corvette]]\nThe completed car arrived in Texas in the fall of 1960, almost 18 months after the chassis had been obtained. It proved to be the only one of the three to be finished in Italy and shipped back to the United States as a complete car. When Laughlin received the car, the fit and finish were not quite what he was expecting, especially as the project had taken nearly three years from conception to completion. Enzo Ferrari would have been quite unhappy to hear that his exclusive coach builder was working on side projects for a group of Texans, so, to Scaglietti's credit, the car was largely a prototype and the work was executed in a shroud of secrecy. Towards the end of the project, Carroll Shelby, who by then was living in Italy, received a late-night phone call from Ed Cole. Cole had been chastised by GM management and was told to drop the project. It was poor timing. American car companies were under pressure to cut down on their high-performance and racing programs. They simply could not deal with the repercussions of a GM-backed Italian bodied Corvette. The remaining cars were shipped to Houston in a partially completed state. Jim Hall took delivery of one. Shelby, who had helped conceive the project, ended up declining the remaining car and it was promptly sold.\n\n==Other projects==\nCarroll Shelby's name is associated with a chili fixings kit.

Shelby became interested in the potential of the [[AC Ace]] chassis, especially after [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] stopped building automobile engines, and the sales with the [[Ford Zephyr engine]] were declining in September 1961.  Shelby contacted Charles Hurlock of AC, who agreed to provide the chassis on credit.  Dave Evans of [[Ford Motor Company]], agreed to provide on credit, the 221-cubic-inch and 260-cubic-inch V8 engines with transmissions.  The new car, called the Carroll Shelby Experimental or CSX0001, would be marketed as the Shelby AC Cobra, then [[AC Cobra]], and eventually, the [[Ford Cobra]].  Production began in March 1962, and 75 cars were sold by the end of the year.  A 100 cars had been built by April 1963, the first 75 with the 260-cubic-inch engine, followed by a 289-cubic-inch engine.  The 427 Cobra prototype was built in Oct. 1964.<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|172\u2013183,190,195}}\n\nShelby started racing his creation in October 1962 at Riverside, with Billy Krause driving the CSX0002.  Racing experience from 1963 indicated that further modifications were necessary to make the Cobra competitive with the Ferrari GT cars; in particular, the AC roadster body needed to be replaced with a lower-drag enclosed coupe body for high-speed circuits.  The result was the [[Shelby Daytona]] Coupe, which took three GT class wins on the 1964 [[World Sportscar Championship]] GT circuit, including Le Mans and the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood, plus the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[United States Road Racing Championship|U.S. GT Championship]].  Then in 1965, Shelby American Cobra won the [[World Sportscar Championship|International Championship for GT Manufacturers]].<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|180,202,208\u2013210,213\u2013214,217,221}}\n\nAfter success with the Daytona Coupe in 1964, Shelby-American became more heavily involved in Ford's [[Ford GT40|GT40]] Sports Prototype racing program, which had experienced disappointing results.  Shelby made changes to running gear, particularly transmissions, to improve reliability, and designed their GT40 Mark II variant around Ford's 7.0-liter engine.  The results paid off spectacularly in 1966, with the Mark II bringing Ford the overall Constructors' title in the World Sportscar Championship, clinched with their 1-2-3 finish at Le Mans.  But Ford could not rest on its laurels in light of Ferrari's determined efforts, and was developing a radical new prototype with a lightweight chassis based on aluminum honeycomb panels.  Shelby was brought in to finalize development of the car after the project experienced setbacks in 1966.  The Mark IV was introduced for the 1967 [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and won handily, then was prepared for Le Mans.  Various misfortunes took Ford out of realistic contention for a repeat title, but the Shelby-American team delivered another record-breaking statement win at Le Mans.  An exclamation point was added to that statement when [[Dan Gurney]] shook and sprayed champagne on the podium, starting a tradition.  The Mark IV was Shelby's last prototype racer, as new limits on engine displacement for that class took all of Ford's high-performance engines out of eligibility.\n\nShelby's early racing successes led to a joint effort of Ford and Shelby-American to produce the Mustang-based [[Shelby GT350]], starting in 1965, then the [[Shelby GT500]], starting in 1967. Shelby produced those cars through 1968, then subsequent cars with the Shelby GT brand were produced in-house by Ford.\n\nAfter parting with Ford, Shelby moved on to help develop performance cars with divisions of the two other [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big 3]] American companies: [[Dodge]], and [[Oldsmobile]].\n\nIn the intervening years, Shelby had a series of ventures start and stop relating to production of \"completion\" Cobras&nbsp;\u2014 cars that were allegedly built using \"leftover\" parts and frames. In the 1960s, the [[FIA]] required entrants (Shelby, Ford, Ferrari, etc.) to produce at least 100 cars for [[homologated]] classes of racing. Shelby simply ordered an insufficient number of cars and skipped a large block of [[Vehicle Identification Number]]s, to create the illusion the company had imported large numbers of cars. Decades later in the 1990s, Carroll alleged that he had found the \"left over\" frames, and began selling cars which were supposedly finally \"completed\". After it was discovered the cars were built from scratch in collaboration with McCluskey, Ltd., they were re-termed \"continuation\" Cobras. The cars are still built to this day, known as the current CSX4000 series of Cobras.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] in 1991, the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/carroll-shelby.html Carroll Shelby] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref> in 1992, the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1992,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319205857/http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/carroll-shelby/126/ Automotive Hall of Fame]</ref> and the [[Diecast Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

All other Shelbys were re-engineered models produced by other manufacturers and then modified by Shelby.\n\nPrior to production of the Series 1, significant costs were incurred in testing and certification required to conform to 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Once completed, a total of 249 production Series 1 cars were constructed by Shelby American as model year 1999 cars.\n\nDuring production, Venture Corporation purchased Shelby American, Inc.

Included in the asset purchase were enough components to produce several more complete Series 1s.\n\nBecause the 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards certificate had expired, and the cost to re-certify the car was prohibitive, all Series 1's produced after that date were completed as \"component cars\" and delivered with no engine or transmission.  Those \"component car\" models built in 2005 are identified with a seven-digit vehicle identification number (VIN) and were designated with a CSX5000 series serial number. The original 249 were production cars with a seventeen-digit VIN.\n\nThe Series 1 was produced in both supercharged and normally aspirated versions. Supercharged cars were also outfitted by the factory with larger brakes and a heavy duty clutch. Performance is near \"supercar\" category with a [[0 to 60 mph]] time at 4.1 seconds for the supercharged version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.caranddriver.com/files/shelby-series-1.pdf |title=Shelby Series 1 |publisher=Car and Driver |date= |accessdate=27 December 2015}}</ref>  Nicely optioned, Series 1 had power steering, power disc brakes, factory air conditioning, power windows, and an AM/FM/CD audio system.

In 2004, a new '''[[Ford Shelby Cobra Concept]]''' was shown off at U.S. car shows. Built with a retro body mimicking the 1960s [[AC Cobra|Cobras]] mixed with modern touches, it was based on the [[Ford GT]] chassis (reworked for [[front engine]]/[[rear wheel drive]]) powered with a 6.4&nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] that produced 605&nbsp;hp (451&nbsp;kW). It received overwhelmingly positive press reviews and has won the \"Best In Show\" award at Detroit International Auto Show.\n\nA coupe version of the Shelby Cobra roadster was introduced the following year. The '''[[Ford Shelby GR-1]]''' concept car of 2005. While sporting a completely modern design, it showed a nod to the 1960s [[Shelby Daytona]]. The GR-1, like the Cobra, is based on the GT's chassis. Press reviews for the GR-1 have been positive. The car was featured on the cover of ''[[Motor Trend]]'' and ''[[Car Magazine]]''. The Ford Shelby GR-1 could possibly be built, taking over the [[Ford GT]]'s production line after its production comes to an end.\n\nIn 2005, Carroll Shelby built his first modern Masterpiece, the CSM #00001 V6 Shelby Mustang CS6, to prove to Ford that he could still build high-performance cars, and that he did, with the V6 putting out 380HP it made the V6 Shelby faster than Ford's V8 300HP. Ford thought the CS6 would hurt Ford Mustang V8 sales, Ford told Shelby to go with the V8 instead. Few CS6 Shelbys were made by Shelby; consequently these are among the rarest Shelbys in the world.\n\nThe [[Shelby Mustang|Shelby GT500]] was revealed at the [[New York International Auto Show]], and became available in the summer of 2006 as part of the model year 2007 lineup. It was powered by a 5.4 Liter Modular V8, with four-valves-per-cylinder heads borrowed from the $150K Ford GT supercar, an Eaton M122 [[Roots-type supercharger]] and is rated by Ford at {{convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|480|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. It boasts a [[Tremec]] T-6060 [[manual transmission]], reworked [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] geometry, 18-inch wheels, functional aerodynamic body kit, and still retains the [[Live axle|solid rear axle]]. The GT500 starts at an MSRP of $40,930 for the coupe, and $45,755 for the convertible version. Although Carroll Shelby had no hands-on involvement in the design of the car, he did provide Ford and SVT (Special Vehicle Team) input on what would make the car better and convinced Ford to enlist wider rear tires (from 255&nbsp;mm wide to 285&nbsp;mm wide).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nShelby, in cooperation with the [[Hertz Corporation]], produced 500 cars named \"Shelby GT-H\" in 2006. This was a special-edition Ford Mustang GT, available for rental from Hertz. A Ford Racing Performance Group FR1 Power Pack increased the GT's 4.6 L V8 engine to {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The cars included a custom Shelby hood and black and gold body styling, incorporating a gold-plated \"Hertz\" nameplate on both sides.\n\nA consumer version of the Shelby GT-H was available from Shelby through Ford dealers, called the Shelby GT. There were 5,682 vehicles for 2007 and 2,300 for 2008 were built. They had the same engine as the GT-H, but more suspension, appearance and drivetrain upgrades and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. White and black colors were available for 2007 models and grabber orange or vista blue were available for 2008. A convertible was available in 2008 also. An available upgrade from the Shelby factory in Las Vegas were a few different superchargers. It then was called a Shelby GT/SC. All Shelby GTs are shipped with the Shelby serial number (CSM) on the dashboard badge and in the engine compartment, such as 07SGT0001 or 08SGT0001.\n\n==Non-Ford projects==\nIn his later years, Shelby brought several lawsuits against companies making copies of the Cobra body for use on kit cars&nbsp;\u2013 ostensibly for copyright, trademark and patent violations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Despite the litigation, the Cobra kit car industry continues to thrive.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOne of the lawsuits involved the Superformance Brock Coupe, a copy of the original Shelby Daytona Coupe. The Superformance Brock Coupe was designed by [[Pete Brock]], who had also designed the original Daytona Coupe for Shelby. Shelby American sued Superformance after the company had developed and begun production of the Superformance Brock Coupe. Eventually, the litigation was settled, though the terms of the settlement have never been released to the public. As a result of the agreement between the two companies, the product is now known as the Shelby Daytona Coupe, despite being neither designed nor built by Shelby American. Nearly 150 of these new Shelby Daytona Coupes have been built as of February 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 2002, Unique Performance, a company of Farmers Branch, Texas, purchased a license from Carroll Shelby Enterprises to place his name on a series of continuation vintage vehicles. This company specialized in recreating 1960s-style Shelby Mustangs. They purchased used Mustangs and installed updated versions of the Shelby 325-horsepower 302-cubic-inch V8 engine. They also use modern five-speed manual transmissions, brakes, steering, suspension, interiors and entertainment systems.

Like most Ferrari repairs, this was not going to be a cheap, simple fix. At the time, Laughlin was an active participant in the American sports car racing scene and was a close acquaintance of many of the key figures, including fellow Texan Shelby. The two had witnessed a number of V8-powered home-built specials challenge, and often defeat, the best that Europe had to offer. The idea developed that they should build a dual-purpose car based on the solid mechanicals of the Chevrolet Corvette. European-style alloy coachwork could help the chassis finally realize its potential. By chance, Laughlin owned a few Chevrolet dealerships and had a particularly valuable friend in Peter Coltrin, an automotive journalist who had gained an \u201cin\u201d with the influential Italians. Laughlin met with Jim Hall and Carroll Shelby to begin discussing what form their new Italian-American hybrid would take. The general consensus was that they should create a car that offered the best of both worlds \u2013 a Corvette with the distinction, performance and style of a Ferrari, but with the power and reliability of a Chevrolet. The aim was to create a genuine high-performance GT with enough leg and headroom to meet American expectations. Once this was decided, Coltrin put Laughlin in touch with Sergio Scaglietti. With the help of Chevrolet General Manager Ed Cole, three 1959 Corvette chassis were discreetly acquired from the St. Louis Corvette plant before bodies could be fitted \u2013 one was specified with a \u201cfuelie\u201d and a four-speed, the others came with twin four barrels and automatics. During one of his frequent trips through Europe, Laughlin met with Sergio Scaglietti who agreed to produce a small run of bodies for the Corvette chassis. At the time, Scaglietti was busy turning out Ferrari's Tour de France and purpose-built racing cars. The Scaglietti Corvette would follow the lines of the Tour de France, albeit lines adapted to fit the Corvette's larger footprint. In an effort to impress, or perhaps, appease GM management, Laughlin specified a proper Corvette grille. The interior would be similarly hybridized with an intriguing combination of Americana \u2013 Stewart Warner gauges, T-handle parking brake, Corvette shift knob; and classic Italian GT \u2013 a purposeful crackle-finish dashboard, deeply bolstered leather seats and exquisite door hardware. \n[[File:ScagliettiCorvette.JPG|thumb|240px|right|1959 [[Scaglietti]] Corvette]]\nThe completed car arrived in Texas in the fall of 1960, almost 18 months after the chassis had been obtained. It proved to be the only one of the three to be finished in Italy and shipped back to the United States as a complete car. When Laughlin received the car, the fit and finish were not quite what he was expecting, especially as the project had taken nearly three years from conception to completion. Enzo Ferrari would have been quite unhappy to hear that his exclusive coach builder was working on side projects for a group of Texans, so, to Scaglietti's credit, the car was largely a prototype and the work was executed in a shroud of secrecy. Towards the end of the project, Carroll Shelby, who by then was living in Italy, received a late-night phone call from Ed Cole. Cole had been chastised by GM management and was told to drop the project. It was poor timing. American car companies were under pressure to cut down on their high-performance and racing programs. They simply could not deal with the repercussions of a GM-backed Italian bodied Corvette. The remaining cars were shipped to Houston in a partially completed state. Jim Hall took delivery of one. Shelby, who had helped conceive the project, ended up declining the remaining car and it was promptly sold.\n\n==Other projects==\nCarroll Shelby's name is associated with a chili fixings kit.
