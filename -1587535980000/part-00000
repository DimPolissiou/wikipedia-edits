Macedonia is the largest and {{nowrap|second-most-populous}} Greek region, with a population of 2.38 million in 2017. The region is highly [[mountain]]ous, with most major urban centers such as [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Kavala]] being concentrated on its southern coastline. Together with [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], and sometimes also [[Thessaly]] and [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], it is part of [[Northern Greece]]. Greek Macedonia encompasses entirely the southern part of the [[region of Macedonia]],<ref>Roy E. H.

It also contains [[Mount Athos]], an autonomous monastic region of Greece. Macedonia forms part of Greece's [[border|national frontier]] with three countries: [[Bulgaria]] to the northeast, [[North Macedonia]] to the north, and [[Albania]] to the northwest.\n\nMacedonia incorporates most of the territories of ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], a kingdom ruled by the [[Argead Dynasty|Argeads]], whose most celebrated members were [[Alexander the Great]] and his father [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. The name ''Macedonia'' was later applied to a number of widely-differing administrative areas in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires, resulting in [[Macedonia (region)|modern geographical Macedonia]]. Even prior to the establishment of the modern Greek state in 1830 Macedonia was identified as a Greek province, albeit without clearly defined geographical borders.<ref name=\"Etairia Makedonikon Spoudon 1\">{{cite book |last1=Grigoriou |first1= Alexandros Ch. |last2=Chekimoglou |first2= Evangelos A. |script-title=el:\u0397 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd 1430\u20131930 |trans-title=The Thessaloniki of Explorers 1430\u20131930 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=p6vdPgAACAAJ&dq=%CE%97+%CE%98%CE%B5%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%BA%CE%B7+%CF%84%CF%89%CE%BD+%CE%A0%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B7%CE%B3%CE%B7%CF%84%CF%8E%CE%BD |accessdate=2 August 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=\u0395\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03a3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd |location=Thessaloniki |language=Greek |isbn=978-960-7265-91-3 |page=43 |quote=From Robert de Dreux's personal journals, 1669: Leaving a village named Baicui, we reached Thessaloniki, which is one of the most splendid cities of Macedonia and the whole of Greece.}}</ref><ref>\"The whole of Greece is divided into four great pashaliks; Tripolizza, Egripo or Neropont, Yanina, and Salonica.

The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the [[palaeolithic]] period, notably with the [[Petralona cave]] in which was found the oldest yet known European humanoid, ''[[Archanthropus europaeus petraloniensis]]''. In the [[Late Neolithic]] period (c.&nbsp;4500 to 3500&nbsp;BC), trade took place with quite distant regions, indicating rapid socio-economic changes. One of the most important innovations was the start of copper working.\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{details|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|The expansion of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom up to the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip II]]]]\n[[File:Amfipoli, Greece - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Lion of Amphipolis]]; erected in 4th BC in honour of [[Laomedon of Mytilene]], general of Alexander the Great]]\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the history of Macedonia began with the [[Ancient Macedonians|Makednoi]] tribe, among the first to use the name, migrating to the region from [[Histiaeotis]] in the south. There they lived near Thracian tribes such as the [[Bryges]] who would later leave Macedonia for [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and become known as [[Phrygia]]ns. ''[[Macedonia (terminology)#Etymology|Macedonia]]'' was named after the Makednoi. Accounts of other [[toponym]]s such as [[Imathia|Emathia]] are attested to have been in use before that. Herodotus claims that\na branch of the Macedonians invaded Southern Greece towards the end of the second millennium B.C. Upon reaching the Peloponnese the invaders were renamed [[Dorians]], triggering the accounts of the Dorian invasion. For centuries the Macedonian tribes were organized in independent kingdoms, in what is now Central Macedonia, and their role in internal Hellenic politics was minimal, even before the rise of Athens. The Macedonians claimed to be Dorian Greeks (Argive Greeks) and there were many [[Ionians]] in the coastal regions. The rest of the region was inhabited by various Thracian and Illyrian tribes as well as mostly coastal colonies of other Greek states such as [[Amphipolis]], Olynthos, Potidea, Stageira and many others, and to the north another tribe dwelt, called the [[Paeonians]]. During the late 6th and early 5th century BC, the region came under Persian rule until the destruction of Xerxes at [[Plataea]]. During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Macedonia became the theatre of many military actions by the [[Peloponnesian League]] and the Athenians, and saw incursions of Thracians and Illyrians, as attested by Thucydides. Many Macedonian cities were allied to the Spartans (both the Spartans and the Macedonians were Dorian, while the Athenians were Ionian), but Athens maintained the colony of Amphipolis under her control for many years. The kingdom of [[Macedon]], was reorganized by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and achieved the union of Greek states by forming the [[League of Corinth]]. After his assassination, his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] succeeded to the throne of Macedon and carrying the title of [[Hegemon]] of [[League of Corinth]] started his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|long campaign]] towards the east.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also|Macedonian Wars|Macedonia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:\u0391\u03a8\u0399\u0394\u0391 \u0393\u0391\u039b\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a5 2.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman-era [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] in Thessaloniki, capital of Roman Macedonia]]\n\nMacedonia remained an important and powerful kingdom until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (June 22, 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia. For a brief period a Macedonian republic called the \"Koinon of the Macedonians\" was established. It was divided into four administrative districts by the Romans in the hope that this would make revolts more difficult, but this manoeuvre failed.

The passage reports that Paul and his companions responded immediately to the invitation.\n\nSubsequently the provinces of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] as well as other regions to the north were incorporated into a new Provincia Macedonia, but in 297 AD under a [[Diocletian]]ic reform many of these regions were removed and two new provinces were created: Macedonia Prima and Macedonia Salutaris (from 479 to 482 AD Macedonia Secunda). Macedonia Prima coincided approximately with Strabo's definition of Macedonia and with the modern administrative district of Greece<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\" /> and had [[Thessalonica|Thessaloniki]] as its capital, while Macedonia Salutaris had the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city of [[Stobi]] (near [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]]) as its capital. This subdivision is mentioned in [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]]' Synecdemon (527\u2013528) and remained through the reign of emperor [[Justinian]].\n\nThe [[Slav]]ic, [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions in the 6\u20137th centuries devastated both provinces<ref>{{cite book |first=John Julius |last=Norwich |title=A short history of Byzantium |publisher=Penguin |year=1998 }}</ref> with only parts of Macedonia Prima in the coastal areas and nearer [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] remaining in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] hands, while most of the hinterland was disputed between the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Macedonian regions under Byzantine control passed under the [[tourma]] of Macedonia to the province of [[Thrace]].\n\nA new system of administration came into place in 789\u2013802 AD, following the [[Byzantine empire]]'s recovery from these invasions. The new system was based on administrative divisions called [[Themata]]. The region of Macedonia Prima (the territory of modern Greek administrative district of Macedonia) was divided between the Thema of Thessaloniki and the Thema of Strymon, so that only the region of the area from [[Nestos (river)|Nestos]] eastwards continued to carry the name Macedonia, referred to as the [[Macedonia (theme)|Thema of Macedonia]] or the Thema of \"Macedonia in Thrace\".

Following the campaigns of [[Basil II]], all of Macedonia returned to the Byzantine state. Following the [[Fourth Crusade]] 1203&ndash;1204, a short-lived [[Crusader states|Crusader]] realm, the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], was established in the region. It was subdued by the co-founder of the Greek [[Despotate of Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] in 1224, when Greek Macedonia and the city of [[Thessaloniki]] were at the heart of the short-lived [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. Returning to the restored [[Byzantine Empire]] shortly thereafter, Greek Macedonia remained in Byzantine hands until the 1340s, when all of Macedonia (except Thessaloniki, and possibly [[Veria]]) was conquered by the Serbian ruler [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia|Stefan Du\u0161an]].<ref>Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', 301&ndash;302</ref> Divided between Serbia and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] after Du\u0161an's death, the region fell quickly to the advancing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], with Thessaloniki alone holding out until 1387.

The memory of the event has survived through folk traditions containing fact and myths. Apostolos Vacalopoulos records the following Turkish tradition connected with the capture of Thessaloniki:<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia 1354&ndash;1833'', [http://www.promacedonia.org/en/av/av_3_4.htm 97]</ref>\n{{quote|\"While [[Murad II|Murad]] was asleep in his palace at Yenitsa, the story has it that, God appeared to him in a dream and gave him a lovely rose to smell, full of perfume. The sultan was so amazed by its beauty that he begged God to give it to him. God replied, \"This rose, Murad, is Thessalonica. Know that it is to you granted by heaven to enjoy it. Do not waste time; go and take it\". Complying with this exhortation from, Murad marched against Thessalonica and, as it has been written, captured it.\"}}\n\n[[Thessaloniki]] became a centre of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration in the Balkans. While most of Macedonia was ruled by the Ottomans, in [[Mount Athos]] the monastic community continued to exist in a state of autonomy. The remainder of the [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula also enjoyed an autonomous status: the \"Koinon of Mademochoria\" was governed by a locally appointed council due to privileges obtained on account of its wealth, coming from the gold and silver mines in the area.\n\nThere were several uprisings in Macedonia during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], including an uprising after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] that ended in massacres of the Greek population, the uprising in [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] of the armatolos [[Zisis Karademos]] in 1705, a rebellion in the area of [[Grevena]] by a [[Klepht]] called Ziakas (1730\u20131810) and the Greek Declaration of Independence in Macedonia by [[Emmanouel Pappas|Emmanuel Pappas]] in 1821, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. In 1854 [[Theodoros Ziakas]], the son of the klepht Ziakas, together with [[Dimitrios Karatasos]], who had been among  the captains at the siege of [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] in 1821, led another uprising in Western Macedonia that has been profusely commemorated in Greek folk song.\n\n===Modern history===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Balkan Wars|Macedonian Front|Movement of National Defence}}\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The 1st Battalion of the [[Provisional Government of National Defence|National Defence]] marches on its way to the Front, during WWI.]]\n\nGreece gained the southern parts of the region with Thessaloniki from the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[First Balkan War]], and expanded its share in the [[Second Balkan War]] against Bulgaria. The boundaries of Greek Macedonia were finalized in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In [[World War I]], Macedonia became a battlefield. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], favoured entering the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], while the Germanophile King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] favored neutrality. Invited by Venizelos, in autumn 1915, the Allies landed forces in Thessaloniki to aid [[Serbia]] in [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|its war]] against Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, but their intervention came too late to prevent the Serbian collapse. The [[Macedonian front]] was established, with Thessaloniki at its heart, while in summer 1916 the Bulgarians [[Struma operation|took over]] Greek eastern Macedonia without opposition. This provoked a military uprising among pro-Venizelist officers in Thessaloniki, resulting in the establishment of a \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\" in the city, headed by Venizelos, which entered the war alongside the Allies. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an [[Noemvriana|armed confrontation]] in Athens between Entente and royalist forces the King abdicated, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens in June 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nIn [[World War II]] Macedonia was [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied by the Axis]] (1941\u201344), with Germany taking western and central Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Bulgaria occupying and annexing eastern Macedonia.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Slavic peasants identified themselves based on belonging to their family, village, or local region, or as \"[[Rum Millet]]\", i.e. members of the Greek-dominated community of Orthodox Christians. The Slavs of Macedonia generally referred to themselves and were known as \"Bulgarians\", but the word \"Bulgarian\" invoked the idea of a poor, Slav-speaking peasant.  By the middle of the 19th century, peasant communities of Macedonia experienced the formation of deep divisions with [[rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]]. From then, the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic speaking communities of northern Greece]] split into two hostile and opposed groups with two different national identities - Greek and Bulgarian.<ref>Gounaris, Basil G. (1995). \"Social Cleavages and National \"Awakening\" in Ottoman Macedonia\". East European Quarterly. 29 (4): 409\u2013426.</ref> By the Second World War and following the defeat of Bulgaria, another further split between the Slavic groups occurred. Conservatives departed with the occupying Bulgarian Army to Bulgaria. Leftists who identified as Macedonians (Slavic), joined the communist-dominated rebel [[Democratic Army of Greece]]. At the conclusion of the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349), most Macedonians of Slavic background were evacuated by the [[Greek Communist Party]] and forced to flee to the [[Socialist Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref>cite web|https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415|cite-title=Macedonian Refugee Children: Exodus Anniversary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415</ref> Some also immigrated to [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].<ref>Panayiotis Diamadis et al.

Macedonia is the largest and {{nowrap|second-most-populous}} Greek region, with a population of 2.38 million in 2017. The region is highly [[mountain]]ous, with most major urban centers such as [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Kavala]] being concentrated on its southern coastline.

The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the [[palaeolithic]] period, notably with the [[Petralona cave]] in which was found the oldest yet known European humanoid, ''[[Archanthropus europaeus petraloniensis]]''. In the [[Late Neolithic]] period (c.&nbsp;4500 to 3500&nbsp;BC), trade took place with quite distant regions, indicating rapid socio-economic changes. One of the most important innovations was the start of copper working.\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{details|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|The expansion of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom up to the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip II]]]]\n[[File:Amfipoli, Greece - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Lion of Amphipolis]]; erected in 4th BC in honour of [[Laomedon of Mytilene]], general of Alexander the Great]]\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the history of Macedonia began with the [[Ancient Macedonians|Makednoi]] tribe, among the first to use the name, migrating to the region from [[Histiaeotis]] in the south. There they lived near Thracian tribes such as the [[Bryges]] who would later leave Macedonia for [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and become known as [[Phrygia]]ns. ''[[Macedonia (terminology)#Etymology|Macedonia]]'' was named after the Makednoi. Accounts of other [[toponym]]s such as [[Imathia|Emathia]] are attested to have been in use before that. Herodotus claims that\na branch of the Macedonians invaded Southern Greece towards the end of the second millennium B.C. Upon reaching the Peloponnese the invaders were renamed [[Dorians]], triggering the accounts of the Dorian invasion. For centuries the Macedonian tribes were organized in independent kingdoms, in what is now Central Macedonia, and their role in internal Hellenic politics was minimal, even before the rise of Athens. The Macedonians claimed to be Dorian Greeks (Argive Greeks) and there were many [[Ionians]] in the coastal regions. The rest of the region was inhabited by various Thracian and Illyrian tribes as well as mostly coastal colonies of other Greek states such as [[Amphipolis]], Olynthos, Potidea, Stageira and many others, and to the north another tribe dwelt, called the [[Paeonians]]. During the late 6th and early 5th century BC, the region came under Persian rule until the destruction of Xerxes at [[Plataea]]. During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Macedonia became the theatre of many military actions by the [[Peloponnesian League]] and the Athenians, and saw incursions of Thracians and Illyrians, as attested by Thucydides. Many Macedonian cities were allied to the Spartans (both the Spartans and the Macedonians were Dorian, while the Athenians were Ionian), but Athens maintained the colony of Amphipolis under her control for many years. The kingdom of [[Macedon]], was reorganized by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and achieved the union of Greek states by forming the [[League of Corinth]]. After his assassination, his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] succeeded to the throne of Macedon and carrying the title of [[Hegemon]] of [[League of Corinth]] started his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|long campaign]] towards the east.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also|Macedonian Wars|Macedonia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:\u0391\u03a8\u0399\u0394\u0391 \u0393\u0391\u039b\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a5 2.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman-era [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] in Thessaloniki, capital of Roman Macedonia]]\n\nMacedonia remained an important and powerful kingdom until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (June 22, 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia. For a brief period a Macedonian republic called the \"Koinon of the Macedonians\" was established. It was divided into four administrative districts by the Romans in the hope that this would make revolts more difficult, but this manoeuvre failed.

The passage reports that Paul and his companions responded immediately to the invitation.\n\nSubsequently the provinces of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] as well as other regions to the north were incorporated into a new Provincia Macedonia, but in 297 AD under a [[Diocletian]]ic reform many of these regions were removed and two new provinces were created: Macedonia Prima and Macedonia Salutaris (from 479 to 482 AD Macedonia Secunda). Macedonia Prima coincided approximately with Strabo's definition of Macedonia and with the modern administrative district of Greece<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\" /> and had [[Thessalonica|Thessaloniki]] as its capital, while Macedonia Salutaris had the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city of [[Stobi]] (near [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]]) as its capital. This subdivision is mentioned in [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]]' Synecdemon (527\u2013528) and remained through the reign of emperor [[Justinian]].\n\nThe [[Slav]]ic, [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions in the 6\u20137th centuries devastated both provinces<ref>{{cite book |first=John Julius |last=Norwich |title=A short history of Byzantium |publisher=Penguin |year=1998 }}</ref> with only parts of Macedonia Prima in the coastal areas and nearer [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] remaining in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] hands, while most of the hinterland was disputed between the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Macedonian regions under Byzantine control passed under the [[tourma]] of Macedonia to the province of [[Thrace]].\n\nA new system of administration came into place in 789\u2013802 AD, following the [[Byzantine empire]]'s recovery from these invasions. The new system was based on administrative divisions called [[Themata]]. The region of Macedonia Prima (the territory of modern Greek administrative district of Macedonia) was divided between the Thema of Thessaloniki and the Thema of Strymon, so that only the region of the area from [[Nestos (river)|Nestos]] eastwards continued to carry the name Macedonia, referred to as the [[Macedonia (theme)|Thema of Macedonia]] or the Thema of \"Macedonia in Thrace\". The Thema of Macedonia in Thrace had its capital in [[Adrianople]].<ref>\u0391\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7, \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae \u0395\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae, \"\u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\" \u03b5\u03ba\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Warren |last=Treadgold |title=Byzantium and Its Army 284\u20131081 |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-8047-2420-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=George |last=Ostrogorsky |title=History of the Byzantine State |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1986 |isbn=0-631-12782-8 }}</ref>\n\n===Medieval history===\n{{See also|Strymon (theme)|Thessalonica (theme)|Kingdom of Thessalonica|Empire of Thessalonica}}\n[[File:\u0386\u03c0\u03bf\u03c8\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \u039a\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u039a\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 (photosiotas).jpg|thumb|View of the Byzantine fortress in the old town of [[Kavala]].]]\n[[File:GR-platamonas-festung.jpg|thumb|right|The Frankish [[Platamon Castle]].]]\n\nFamiliarity with the Slavic element in the area led two brothers from [[Thessaloniki]], [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], to be chosen to convert the Slavs to [[Christianity]]. Following the campaigns of [[Basil II]], all of Macedonia returned to the Byzantine state. Following the [[Fourth Crusade]] 1203&ndash;1204, a short-lived [[Crusader states|Crusader]] realm, the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], was established in the region. It was subdued by the co-founder of the Greek [[Despotate of Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] in 1224, when Greek Macedonia and the city of [[Thessaloniki]] were at the heart of the short-lived [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. Returning to the restored [[Byzantine Empire]] shortly thereafter, Greek Macedonia remained in Byzantine hands until the 1340s, when all of Macedonia (except Thessaloniki, and possibly [[Veria]]) was conquered by the Serbian ruler [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia|Stefan Du\u0161an]].<ref>Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', 301&ndash;302</ref> Divided between Serbia and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] after Du\u0161an's death, the region fell quickly to the advancing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], with Thessaloniki alone holding out until 1387.

The memory of the event has survived through folk traditions containing fact and myths. Apostolos Vacalopoulos records the following Turkish tradition connected with the capture of Thessaloniki:<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia 1354&ndash;1833'', [http://www.promacedonia.org/en/av/av_3_4.htm 97]</ref>\n{{quote|\"While [[Murad II|Murad]] was asleep in his palace at Yenitsa, the story has it that, God appeared to him in a dream and gave him a lovely rose to smell, full of perfume. The sultan was so amazed by its beauty that he begged God to give it to him. God replied, \"This rose, Murad, is Thessalonica. Know that it is to you granted by heaven to enjoy it. Do not waste time; go and take it\". Complying with this exhortation from, Murad marched against Thessalonica and, as it has been written, captured it.\"}}\n\n[[Thessaloniki]] became a centre of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration in the Balkans. While most of Macedonia was ruled by the Ottomans, in [[Mount Athos]] the monastic community continued to exist in a state of autonomy. The remainder of the [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula also enjoyed an autonomous status: the \"Koinon of Mademochoria\" was governed by a locally appointed council due to privileges obtained on account of its wealth, coming from the gold and silver mines in the area.\n\nThere were several uprisings in Macedonia during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], including an uprising after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] that ended in massacres of the Greek population, the uprising in [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] of the armatolos [[Zisis Karademos]] in 1705, a rebellion in the area of [[Grevena]] by a [[Klepht]] called Ziakas (1730\u20131810) and the Greek Declaration of Independence in Macedonia by [[Emmanouel Pappas|Emmanuel Pappas]] in 1821, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. In 1854 [[Theodoros Ziakas]], the son of the klepht Ziakas, together with [[Dimitrios Karatasos]], who had been among  the captains at the siege of [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] in 1821, led another uprising in Western Macedonia that has been profusely commemorated in Greek folk song.\n\n===Modern history===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Balkan Wars|Macedonian Front|Movement of National Defence}}\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The 1st Battalion of the [[Provisional Government of National Defence|National Defence]] marches on its way to the Front, during WWI.]]\n\nGreece gained the southern parts of the region with Thessaloniki from the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[First Balkan War]], and expanded its share in the [[Second Balkan War]] against Bulgaria. The boundaries of Greek Macedonia were finalized in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In [[World War I]], Macedonia became a battlefield. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], favoured entering the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], while the Germanophile King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] favored neutrality. Invited by Venizelos, in autumn 1915, the Allies landed forces in Thessaloniki to aid [[Serbia]] in [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|its war]] against Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, but their intervention came too late to prevent the Serbian collapse. The [[Macedonian front]] was established, with Thessaloniki at its heart, while in summer 1916 the Bulgarians [[Struma operation|took over]] Greek eastern Macedonia without opposition. This provoked a military uprising among pro-Venizelist officers in Thessaloniki, resulting in the establishment of a \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\" in the city, headed by Venizelos, which entered the war alongside the Allies. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an [[Noemvriana|armed confrontation]] in Athens between Entente and royalist forces the King abdicated, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens in June 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nIn [[World War II]] Macedonia was [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied by the Axis]] (1941\u201344), with Germany taking western and central Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Bulgaria occupying and annexing eastern Macedonia.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Slavic peasants identified themselves based on belonging to their family, village, or local region, or as \"[[Rum Millet]]\", i.e. members of the Greek-dominated community of Orthodox Christians. The Slavs of Macedonia generally referred to themselves and were known as \"Bulgarians\", but the word \"Bulgarian\" invoked the idea of a poor, Slav-speaking peasant.  By the middle of the 19th century, peasant communities of Macedonia experienced the formation of deep divisions with [[rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]]. From then, the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic speaking communities of northern Greece]] split into two hostile and opposed groups with two different national identities - Greek and Bulgarian.<ref>Gounaris, Basil G. (1995). \"Social Cleavages and National \"Awakening\" in Ottoman Macedonia\". East European Quarterly. 29 (4): 409\u2013426.</ref> By the Second World War and following the defeat of Bulgaria, another further split between the Slavic groups occurred. Conservatives departed with the occupying Bulgarian Army to Bulgaria. Leftists who identified as Macedonians (Slavic), joined the communist-dominated rebel [[Democratic Army of Greece]]. At the conclusion of the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349), most Macedonians of Slavic background were evacuated by the [[Greek Communist Party]] and forced to flee to the [[Socialist Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref>cite web|https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415|cite-title=Macedonian Refugee Children: Exodus Anniversary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415</ref> Some also immigrated to [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].<ref>Panayiotis Diamadis et al.

He soon became disillusioned with the work and in 1950 applied for a job as a radio talk producer with the BBC. Although he was rejected for this job, his [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] later attracted the interest of [[Mary Adams (broadcaster)|Mary Adams]], head of the Talks (factual broadcasting) department of the BBC's fledgling television service.\n\nAttenborough, like most Britons at that time, did not own a television, and he had seen only one programme in his life.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Attenborough, David|title=Life on Air|publisher=BBC Books|year=2002|isbn=978-0-563-53461-7}} pp. 10\u201311.</ref> However, he accepted Adams' offer of a three-month training course, and in 1952 he joined the BBC full-time. Initially discouraged from appearing on camera because Adams thought his teeth were too big,<ref name=\"Life on Air, p.13\">''Life on Air'', p.13.</ref> he became a producer for the Talks department, which handled all non-fiction broadcasts. His early projects included the quiz show ''Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?'' and ''Song Hunter,'' a series about [[folk music]] presented by [[Alan Lomax]].<ref name=\"Life on Air, p.13\"/>\n\nAttenborough's association with natural history programmes began when he produced and presented the three-part series ''Animal Patterns.'' The studio-bound programme featured animals from [[London Zoo]], with the naturalist [[Julian Huxley]] discussing their use of [[camouflage]], [[aposematism]] and [[courtship display]]s. Through this programme, Attenborough met Jack Lester, the curator of the zoo's reptile house, and they decided to make a series about an animal-collecting expedition. The result was ''[[Zoo Quest]],'' first broadcast in 1954, where Attenborough became the presenter at short notice due to Lester being taken ill.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/05/david-attenborough-used-to-steal-the-animals-he-found-in-the-jungle-and-take-them-home/ |title=David Attenborough used to steal the animals he found in the jungle and take them home |first=James |last=Walton |date=21 May 2016 |magazine=The Spectator |accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] was formally established in Bristol. Attenborough was asked to join it, but declined, not wishing to move from London where he and his young family were settled. Instead, he formed his own department, the Travel and Exploration Unit,<ref name=\"Life on Air, pp.60\u201361\">''Life on Air'', pp.60\u201361.</ref> which allowed him to continue to front ''Zoo Quest'' as well as produce other documentaries, notably the ''Travellers' Tales'' and ''Adventure'' series.<ref name=\"Life on Air, pp.60\u201361\"/>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Attenborough resigned from the permanent staff of the BBC to study for a postgraduate degree in [[social anthropology]] at the [[London School of Economics]], interweaving his study with further filming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/helpers/force-download.php?file=pdf/David_Attenborough.pdf|title=Transcript of interview with David Attenborough|accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> However, he accepted an invitation to return to the BBC as controller of [[BBC Two]] before he could finish the degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/famous-alumni-from-lse-2015-10/#mick-jagger-was-studying-at-lse-when-he-began-playing-with-the-rolling-stones-in-1961-at-first-he-played-with-the-stones-just-on-weekends-and-attended-classes-during-the-week-but-he-ultimately-dropped-out-to-pursue-his-music-career-2|title=These 18 insanely successful people all went to the London School of Economics|website=Businessinsider.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==BBC administration==\nAttenborough became the controller of BBC Two in March 1965, but had a clause inserted in his contract that would allow him to continue making programmes on an occasional basis. Later the same year he filmed elephants in Tanzania, and in 1969 he made a three-part series on the cultural history of the Indonesian island of [[Bali]]. For the 1971 film ''[[A Blank on the Map]]'', he joined the first Western expedition to a remote highland valley in [[New Guinea]] to seek out a [[uncontacted peoples|lost tribe]].\n\nBBC Two had been launched in 1964, but had struggled to capture the public's imagination. When Attenborough arrived as controller, he quickly abolished the channel's quirky kangaroo mascot and shook up the schedule. With a mission to make BBC Two's output diverse and different from that offered by other networks, he began to establish a portfolio of programmes that defined the channel's identity for decades to come. Under his tenure, music, the arts, entertainment, archaeology, experimental comedy, travel, drama, sport, business, science and natural history all found a place in the weekly schedules. Often, an eclectic mix was offered within a single evening's viewing. Programmes he commissioned included ''[[Man Alive (UK TV series)|Man Alive]]'', ''[[Call My Bluff]]'', ''[[Chronicle (UK TV series)|Chronicle]]'', ''[[Match of the Day]]'', ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and ''[[The Money Programme]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=David Attenborough: a fine specimen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/mar/03/davidattenboroughafinespec |accessdate=15 September 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nOne of his most significant decisions was to order a 13-part series on the [[Western art history|history of Western art]], to show off the quality of the new [[UHF#United Kingdom|UHF]] [[colour television]] service that BBC Two offered. Broadcast to universal acclaim in 1969, ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' set the blueprint for landmark authored documentaries, which were informally known as \"tombstone\" or \"sledgehammer\" projects. Others followed, including [[Jacob Bronowski]]'s ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' (also commissioned by Attenborough), and [[Alistair Cooke]]'s ''[[America: A Personal History of the United States|America]]''. Attenborough thought that the story of evolution would be a natural subject for such a series. He shared his idea with [[Christopher Parsons|Chris Parsons]], a producer at the Natural History Unit, who came up with the title ''Life on Earth'' and returned to Bristol to start planning the series. Attenborough harboured a strong desire to present the series himself, but this would not be possible so long as he remained in a management post.\n\nWhile in charge of BBC Two, Attenborough turned down [[Terry Wogan]]'s job application to be a presenter on the channel, stating that there weren't any suitable vacancies. The channel already had an Irish announcer, with Attenborough reflecting in 2016: \"To have had two Irishmen presenting on BBC Two would have looked ridiculous. This is no comment whatsoever on Terry Wogan's talents.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/david-attenborough-rebuffed-terry-wogans-bbc-presenter-job-application-because-they-had-an-irish-announcer-34436348.html|title=David Attenborough 'rebuffed' Terry Wogan's BBC presenter job application because they had an Irish announcer|first=Kerri-Ann |last=Roper|work=The Irish Independent|date=9 February 2016}}</ref>  Attenborough has also acknowledged that he sanctioned the [[wiping]] of programmes during this period to cut costs, including sketches by [[Alan Bennett]], which he later regretted.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10784285/David-Attenborough-my-regrets-over-wiping-Alan-Bennett-dross.html | title= David Attenborough: my regrets over wiping Alan Bennett 'dross' | work=The Telegraph | date=24 April 2014 | accessdate=8 April 2018| last1= Furness | first1= Hannah }}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 Attenborough was promoted to director of programmes, making him responsible for the output of both BBC channels. His tasks, which included agreeing budgets, attending board meetings and firing staff, were now far removed from the business of filming programmes. When Attenborough's name was being suggested as a candidate for the position of [[Director-General of the BBC]] in 1972, he phoned his brother Richard to confess that he had no appetite for the job. Early the following year, he left his post to return to full-time programme-making, leaving him free to write and present the planned natural history epic.<ref name=\"BAFTA Guru\"/>\n\n==Return to broadcasting==\n[[File:David Attenborough NASA.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Attenborough filming commentary for a documentary at [[Kennedy Space Center]]]]\nAfter his resignation, Attenborough became a freelance broadcaster and immediately started work on his next project, a pre-arranged trip to Indonesia with a crew from the Natural History Unit. It resulted in the 1973 series ''Eastwards with Attenborough'', which was similar in tone to the earlier ''Zoo Quest'' but without the animal-collecting element.\n\nAfter his return, he began to work on the scripts for ''Life on Earth''. Due to the scale of his ambition, the BBC decided to partner with an American network to secure the necessary funding. While the negotiations were proceeding, he worked on a number of other television projects. He presented a series on [[tribal art]] (''[[The Tribal Eye]]'', 1975) and another on the voyages of discovery (''[[David Attenborough filmography#1970s|The Explorers]]'', 1975). He also presented a BBC children's series about [[cryptozoology]] entitled ''Fabulous Animals'' (1975), which featured mythical creatures such as the [[griffin]] and [[kraken]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gately |first=Martin |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/101/attenboroughs_fabulous_animals.html |title=Fortean Times episode guide to ''Fabulous Animals'' |publisher=Forteantimes.com |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=4 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827065546/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/101/attenboroughs_fabulous_animals.html |archivedate=27 August 2009  }}</ref> Eventually the BBC signed a co-production deal with [[Turner Broadcasting]] and ''Life on Earth'' moved into production in 1976.\n\n===Life series===\n{{see also|The Life Collection}}\nBeginning with ''[[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]]'' in 1979, Attenborough set about creating a body of work which became a benchmark of quality in wildlife film-making and influenced a generation of documentary film-makers. The series also established many of the hallmarks of the BBC's natural history output. By treating his subject seriously and researching the latest discoveries, Attenborough and his production team gained the trust of scientists, who responded by allowing him to feature their subjects in his programmes. In Rwanda, for example, Attenborough and his crew were granted privileged access to film [[Dian Fossey]]'s research group of [[mountain gorilla]]s. Innovation was another factor in ''Life on Earth'''s success: new film-making techniques were devised to get the shots Attenborough wanted, with a focus on events and animals that were hitherto unfilmed. Computerised airline schedules, which had only recently been introduced, enabled the series to be elaborately devised so that Attenborough visited several locations around the globe in each episode, sometimes even changing continents mid-sentence. Although appearing as the on-screen presenter, he consciously restricted his time on camera to give his subjects top billing.\n\nThe success of ''Life on Earth'' prompted the BBC to consider a follow-up, and five years later, ''[[The Living Planet]]'' was screened. This time, Attenborough built his series around the theme of ecology, the adaptations of living things to their environment. It was another critical and commercial success, generating huge international sales for the BBC. In 1990, ''[[The Trials of Life]]'' completed the original Life trilogy, looking at [[ethology|animal behaviour]] through the different stages of life. The series drew strong reactions from the viewing public for its sequences of [[killer whale]]s hunting sea lions on a Patagonian beach and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s hunting and violently killing a [[black-and-white colobus|colobus]] monkey.\n\nIn the 1990s, Attenborough continued to use the \"Life\" title for a succession of authored documentaries. In 1993, he presented ''[[Life in the Freezer]]'', the first television series to survey the natural history of Antarctica. Although past normal retirement age, he then embarked on a number of more specialised surveys of the natural world, beginning with plants. They proved a difficult subject for his producers, who had to deliver five hours of television featuring what are essentially immobile objects. The result was ''[[The Private Life of Plants]]'' (1995), which showed plants as dynamic organisms by using [[time-lapse photography]] to speed up their growth, and went on to earn a [[Peabody Award]].<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-private-life-of-plants Peabody Award Citation: The Private Life of Plants (1995)]</ref>\n\nPrompted by an enthusiastic [[ornithology|ornithologist]] at the BBC Natural History Unit, Attenborough then turned his attention to the animal kingdom and in particular, birds. As he was neither an obsessive [[birdwatching|twitcher]] nor a bird expert, he decided he was better qualified to make ''[[The Life of Birds]]'' (1998) on the theme of behaviour. The documentary series won a second [[Peabody Award]] the following year.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-life-of-birds-by-david-attenborough 59th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2000.</ref> The order of the remaining \"Life\" series was dictated by developments in camera technology. For ''[[The Life of Mammals]]'' (2002), [[low-light photography|low-light]] and [[infrared photography|infrared]] cameras were deployed to reveal the behaviour of nocturnal mammals. The series contains a number of memorable [[two shot]]s of Attenborough and his subjects, which included chimpanzees, a [[blue whale]] and a [[grizzly bear]]. Advances in [[macro photography]] made it possible to capture natural behaviour of very small creatures for the first time, and in 2005, ''[[Life in the Undergrowth]]'' introduced audiences to the world of invertebrates.\n\nAt this point, Attenborough realised that he had spent 20 years unconsciously assembling a collection of programmes on all the major groups of terrestrial animals and plants \u2013 only reptiles and amphibians were missing. When ''[[Life in Cold Blood]]'' was broadcast in 2008, he had the satisfaction of completing the set, brought together in a DVD encyclopaedia called ''[[Life on Land]]''. In an interview that year, Attenborough was asked to sum up his achievement, and responded:\n\n{{quotation|The evolutionary history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said \"Don't be ridiculous!\" These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will come along and tell it much better than I did, but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still have something to say about the world we live in.<ref name=\"rtimes2\">''Radio Times'' 26 Jan\u20131 February 2008: \"The Last Word\", interview with Jeremy Paxman</ref>}}\n\nHowever, in 2010 Attenborough asserted that his ''[[First Life (TV series)|First Life]]'' \u2013 dealing with evolutionary history before ''Life on Earth'' \u2013 should also be included within the \"Life\" series. In the documentary ''[[Attenborough's Journey]]'', he stated, \"This series, to a degree which I really didn't fully appreciate until I started working on it, really completes the set.\"<ref>''Attenborough's Journey'', BBC Two, 24 October 2010</ref>\n\n===Other documentaries===\n[[File:David Attenborough Great Barrier Reef screening.jpg|thumb|right|Attenborough at a special screening of ''[[Great Barrier Reef (2015 TV series)|Great Barrier Reef]]'' in 2015]]\nAlongside the \"Life\" series, Attenborough has continued to work on other television documentaries, mainly in the natural history genre. He wrote and presented a series on man's influence on the natural history of the Mediterranean basin, ''[[The First Eden]]'', in 1987. Two years later, he demonstrated his passion for fossils in ''[[Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives]]''.\n\nAttenborough narrated every episode of ''[[Wildlife on One]]'', a [[BBC One]] wildlife series that ran for 253 episodes between 1977 and 2005. At its peak, it drew a weekly audience of eight to ten million, and the 1987 episode \"Meerkats United\" was voted the best wildlife documentary of all time by BBC viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/151/Meerkats+United.html |title=Meerkats United |publisher=WildFilmistory.org |accessdate=20 January 2010}}</ref> He has also narrated over 50 episodes of ''[[Natural World (BBC TV series)|Natural World]]'', BBC Two's flagship wildlife series. (Its forerunner, ''[[The World About Us]]'', was created by Attenborough in 1969, as a vehicle for colour television.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/madeintheuk/pdfs/5_david_attenborough_where_the_wild_things_are.pdf |title=\"Where the Wild Things Are\" (Essay for BBC \"Made in the Uk\") |publisher=BBC |first=David |last=Attenborough |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805031208/http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/policies/madeintheuk/pdfs/5_david_attenborough_where_the_wild_things_are.pdf|archivedate=5 August 2011 |accessdate=20 January 2010}}</ref>) In 1997, he narrated the ''[[BBC Wildlife Specials]]'', each focussing on a charismatic species, and screened to mark the Natural History Unit's 40th anniversary.\n\nAs a writer and narrator, Attenborough continued to collaborate with the BBC Natural History Unit in the new millennium. [[Alastair Fothergill]], a senior producer with whom Attenborough had worked on ''The Trials of Life'' and ''Life in the Freezer'', was making ''[[The Blue Planet]]'' (2001), the Unit's first comprehensive series on [[marine life]]. He decided not to use an on-screen presenter due to difficulties in speaking to a camera through diving apparatus, but asked Attenborough to narrate the films. The same team reunited for ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]'' (2006), the biggest nature documentary ever made for television and the first BBC wildlife series to be shot in [[high-definition video|high definition]]. In 2009, he co-wrote and narrated ''[[Life (BBC TV series)|Life]]'', a ten-part series focussing on extraordinary animal behaviour,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/21/bbc.television1|title=Attenborough is back \u2013 again|last=Holmwood|first=Leigh|date=21 September 2007|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref> and narrated ''[[Nature's Great Events]]'', which showed how seasonal changes trigger major natural spectacles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/01_january/05/nature.shtml|title=Nature's Great Events Press Pack|date=11 February 2009|publisher=BBC Press Office}}</ref> In 2011, Fothergill gave Attenborough a more prominent role in ''[[Frozen Planet]]'', a major series on the natural history of the polar regions; Attenborough appeared on screen and authored the final episode, in addition to performing voiceover duties. Attenborough introduced and narrated the Unit's first [[Ultra-high-definition television|4K]] production ''[[Life Story (TV series)|Life Story]].'' For ''[[Planet Earth II]]'' (2016), Attenborough returned as narrator and presenter, with the main theme music composed by [[Hans Zimmer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/planet-earth-two|title=Sir David Attenborough to present brand new landmark natural history series for BBC One|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=22 February 2016|accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02544td|title=Planet Earth II \u2013 BBC One|publisher=BBC|access-date=21 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2014, the corporation announced a trio of new one-off Attenborough documentaries as part of a raft of new natural history programmes. \"Attenborough's Paradise Birds\" and \"Attenborough's Big Birds\" was shown on BBC Two and \"Waking Giants\", which follows the discovery of giant dinosaur bones in South America, aired on BBC One.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29641107|title=David Attenborough to examine ostriches and dinosaurs|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2014|date=16 October 2014}}</ref> The BBC also commissioned [[Atlantic Productions]] to make a three-part, Attenborough-fronted series [[Great Barrier Reef (2015 TV series)|Great Barrier Reef]] in 2015.

In ''[[State of the Planet]]'' (2000), he used the latest scientific evidence and interviews with leading scientists and conservationists to assess the impact of man's activities on the natural world. He later turned to the issues of [[global warming]] (''[[The Truth about Climate Change]]'', 2006) and human population growth (''How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?'', 2009). He also contributed a programme which highlighted the plight of [[endangered species]] to the BBC's ''[[Saving Planet Earth]]'' project in 2007, the 50th anniversary of the Natural History Unit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=66138 |title=IBC Honours BBC Natural History Unit For Contribution To Wildlife Film |date=21 September 2007 |publisher=4rfv.co.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108102754/http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=66138 |archivedate=8 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAttenborough also forged a partnership with Sky, working on documentaries for the broadcaster's new 3D network, [[Sky 3D]].

His most influential work, 1979's ''Life on Earth'', launched a strand of nine authored documentaries with the BBC Natural History Unit which shared the ''Life'' strand name and spanned 30 years. He narrated every episode of the long-running BBC series ''Wildlife on One'' and in his later career has voiced several high-profile BBC wildlife documentaries, among them ''The Blue Planet'' and ''Planet Earth''. He became a pioneer in the 3D documentary format with ''Flying Monsters'' in 2010.\n\n==Books==\nDavid Attenborough's work as an author has strong parallels with his broadcasting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, his published work included accounts of his animal collecting expeditions around the world, which became the ''Zoo Quest'' series. He wrote an accompanying volume to each of his nine ''Life'' documentaries, along with books on tribal art and birds of paradise. His autobiography, ''Life on Air'', was published in 2002, revised in 2009 and is one of a number of his works which is available as a self-narrated audiobook.

He soon became disillusioned with the work and in 1950 applied for a job as a radio talk producer with the BBC. Although he was rejected for this job, his [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] later attracted the interest of [[Mary Adams (broadcaster)|Mary Adams]], head of the Talks (factual broadcasting) department of the BBC's fledgling television service.\n\nAttenborough, like most Britons at that time, did not own a television, and he had seen only one programme in his life.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Attenborough, David|title=Life on Air|publisher=BBC Books|year=2002|isbn=978-0-563-53461-7}} pp. 10\u201311.</ref> However, he accepted Adams' offer of a three-month training course, and in 1952 he joined the BBC full-time. Initially discouraged from appearing on camera because Adams thought his teeth were too big,<ref name=\"Life on Air, p.13\">''Life on Air'', p.13.</ref> he became a producer for the Talks department, which handled all non-fiction broadcasts. His early projects included the quiz show ''Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?'' and ''Song Hunter,'' a series about [[folk music]] presented by [[Alan Lomax]].<ref name=\"Life on Air, p.13\"/>\n\nAttenborough's association with natural history programmes began when he produced and presented the three-part series ''Animal Patterns.'' The studio-bound programme featured animals from [[London Zoo]], with the naturalist [[Julian Huxley]] discussing their use of [[camouflage]], [[aposematism]] and [[courtship display]]s. Through this programme, Attenborough met Jack Lester, the curator of the zoo's reptile house, and they decided to make a series about an animal-collecting expedition. The result was ''[[Zoo Quest]],'' first broadcast in 1954, where Attenborough became the presenter at short notice due to Lester being taken ill.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/05/david-attenborough-used-to-steal-the-animals-he-found-in-the-jungle-and-take-them-home/ |title=David Attenborough used to steal the animals he found in the jungle and take them home |first=James |last=Walton |date=21 May 2016 |magazine=The Spectator |accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] was formally established in Bristol. Attenborough was asked to join it, but declined, not wishing to move from London where he and his young family were settled. Instead, he formed his own department, the Travel and Exploration Unit,<ref name=\"Life on Air, pp.60\u201361\">''Life on Air'', pp.60\u201361.</ref> which allowed him to continue to front ''Zoo Quest'' as well as produce other documentaries, notably the ''Travellers' Tales'' and ''Adventure'' series.<ref name=\"Life on Air, pp.60\u201361\"/>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Attenborough resigned from the permanent staff of the BBC to study for a postgraduate degree in [[social anthropology]] at the [[London School of Economics]], interweaving his study with further filming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/helpers/force-download.php?file=pdf/David_Attenborough.pdf|title=Transcript of interview with David Attenborough|accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref> However, he accepted an invitation to return to the BBC as controller of [[BBC Two]] before he could finish the degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/famous-alumni-from-lse-2015-10/#mick-jagger-was-studying-at-lse-when-he-began-playing-with-the-rolling-stones-in-1961-at-first-he-played-with-the-stones-just-on-weekends-and-attended-classes-during-the-week-but-he-ultimately-dropped-out-to-pursue-his-music-career-2|title=These 18 insanely successful people all went to the London School of Economics|website=Businessinsider.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==BBC administration==\nAttenborough became the controller of BBC Two in March 1965, but had a clause inserted in his contract that would allow him to continue making programmes on an occasional basis. Later the same year he filmed elephants in Tanzania, and in 1969 he made a three-part series on the cultural history of the Indonesian island of [[Bali]]. For the 1971 film ''[[A Blank on the Map]]'', he joined the first Western expedition to a remote highland valley in [[New Guinea]] to seek out a [[uncontacted peoples|lost tribe]].\n\nBBC Two had been launched in 1964, but had struggled to capture the public's imagination. When Attenborough arrived as controller, he quickly abolished the channel's quirky kangaroo mascot and shook up the schedule. With a mission to make BBC Two's output diverse and different from that offered by other networks, he began to establish a portfolio of programmes that defined the channel's identity for decades to come. Under his tenure, music, the arts, entertainment, archaeology, experimental comedy, travel, drama, sport, business, science and natural history all found a place in the weekly schedules. Often, an eclectic mix was offered within a single evening's viewing. Programmes he commissioned included ''[[Man Alive (UK TV series)|Man Alive]]'', ''[[Call My Bluff]]'', ''[[Chronicle (UK TV series)|Chronicle]]'', ''[[Match of the Day]]'', ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and ''[[The Money Programme]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=David Attenborough: a fine specimen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/mar/03/davidattenboroughafinespec |accessdate=15 September 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nOne of his most significant decisions was to order a 13-part series on the [[Western art history|history of Western art]], to show off the quality of the new [[UHF#United Kingdom|UHF]] [[colour television]] service that BBC Two offered. Broadcast to universal acclaim in 1969, ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' set the blueprint for landmark authored documentaries, which were informally known as \"tombstone\" or \"sledgehammer\" projects. Others followed, including [[Jacob Bronowski]]'s ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' (also commissioned by Attenborough), and [[Alistair Cooke]]'s ''[[America: A Personal History of the United States|America]]''. Attenborough thought that the story of evolution would be a natural subject for such a series. He shared his idea with [[Christopher Parsons|Chris Parsons]], a producer at the Natural History Unit, who came up with the title ''Life on Earth'' and returned to Bristol to start planning the series. Attenborough harboured a strong desire to present the series himself, but this would not be possible so long as he remained in a management post.\n\nWhile in charge of BBC Two, Attenborough turned down [[Terry Wogan]]'s job application to be a presenter on the channel, stating that there weren't any suitable vacancies. The channel already had an Irish announcer, with Attenborough reflecting in 2016: \"To have had two Irishmen presenting on BBC Two would have looked ridiculous. This is no comment whatsoever on Terry Wogan's talents.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/david-attenborough-rebuffed-terry-wogans-bbc-presenter-job-application-because-they-had-an-irish-announcer-34436348.html|title=David Attenborough 'rebuffed' Terry Wogan's BBC presenter job application because they had an Irish announcer|first=Kerri-Ann |last=Roper|work=The Irish Independent|date=9 February 2016}}</ref>  Attenborough has also acknowledged that he sanctioned the [[wiping]] of programmes during this period to cut costs, including sketches by [[Alan Bennett]], which he later regretted.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10784285/David-Attenborough-my-regrets-over-wiping-Alan-Bennett-dross.html | title= David Attenborough: my regrets over wiping Alan Bennett 'dross' | work=The Telegraph | date=24 April 2014 | accessdate=8 April 2018| last1= Furness | first1= Hannah }}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 Attenborough was promoted to director of programmes, making him responsible for the output of both BBC channels. His tasks, which included agreeing budgets, attending board meetings and firing staff, were now far removed from the business of filming programmes. When Attenborough's name was being suggested as a candidate for the position of [[Director-General of the BBC]] in 1972, he phoned his brother Richard to confess that he had no appetite for the job. Early the following year, he left his post to return to full-time programme-making, leaving him free to write and present the planned natural history epic.<ref name=\"BAFTA Guru\"/>\n\n==Return to broadcasting==\n[[File:David Attenborough NASA.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Attenborough filming commentary for a documentary at [[Kennedy Space Center]]]]\nAfter his resignation, Attenborough became a freelance broadcaster and immediately started work on his next project, a pre-arranged trip to Indonesia with a crew from the Natural History Unit. It resulted in the 1973 series ''Eastwards with Attenborough'', which was similar in tone to the earlier ''Zoo Quest'' but without the animal-collecting element.\n\nAfter his return, he began to work on the scripts for ''Life on Earth''. Due to the scale of his ambition, the BBC decided to partner with an American network to secure the necessary funding. While the negotiations were proceeding, he worked on a number of other television projects. He presented a series on [[tribal art]] (''[[The Tribal Eye]]'', 1975) and another on the voyages of discovery (''[[David Attenborough filmography#1970s|The Explorers]]'', 1975). He also presented a BBC children's series about [[cryptozoology]] entitled ''Fabulous Animals'' (1975), which featured mythical creatures such as the [[griffin]] and [[kraken]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gately |first=Martin |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/101/attenboroughs_fabulous_animals.html |title=Fortean Times episode guide to ''Fabulous Animals'' |publisher=Forteantimes.com |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=4 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827065546/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/101/attenboroughs_fabulous_animals.html |archivedate=27 August 2009  }}</ref> Eventually the BBC signed a co-production deal with [[Turner Broadcasting]] and ''Life on Earth'' moved into production in 1976.\n\n===Life series===\n{{see also|The Life Collection}}\nBeginning with ''[[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]]'' in 1979, Attenborough set about creating a body of work which became a benchmark of quality in wildlife film-making and influenced a generation of documentary film-makers. The series also established many of the hallmarks of the BBC's natural history output. By treating his subject seriously and researching the latest discoveries, Attenborough and his production team gained the trust of scientists, who responded by allowing him to feature their subjects in his programmes. In Rwanda, for example, Attenborough and his crew were granted privileged access to film [[Dian Fossey]]'s research group of [[mountain gorilla]]s. Innovation was another factor in ''Life on Earth'''s success: new film-making techniques were devised to get the shots Attenborough wanted, with a focus on events and animals that were hitherto unfilmed. Computerised airline schedules, which had only recently been introduced, enabled the series to be elaborately devised so that Attenborough visited several locations around the globe in each episode, sometimes even changing continents mid-sentence. Although appearing as the on-screen presenter, he consciously restricted his time on camera to give his subjects top billing.\n\nThe success of ''Life on Earth'' prompted the BBC to consider a follow-up, and five years later, ''[[The Living Planet]]'' was screened. This time, Attenborough built his series around the theme of ecology, the adaptations of living things to their environment. It was another critical and commercial success, generating huge international sales for the BBC. In 1990, ''[[The Trials of Life]]'' completed the original Life trilogy, looking at [[ethology|animal behaviour]] through the different stages of life. The series drew strong reactions from the viewing public for its sequences of [[killer whale]]s hunting sea lions on a Patagonian beach and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s hunting and violently killing a [[black-and-white colobus|colobus]] monkey.\n\nIn the 1990s, Attenborough continued to use the \"Life\" title for a succession of authored documentaries. In 1993, he presented ''[[Life in the Freezer]]'', the first television series to survey the natural history of Antarctica. Although past normal retirement age, he then embarked on a number of more specialised surveys of the natural world, beginning with plants. They proved a difficult subject for his producers, who had to deliver five hours of television featuring what are essentially immobile objects. The result was ''[[The Private Life of Plants]]'' (1995), which showed plants as dynamic organisms by using [[time-lapse photography]] to speed up their growth, and went on to earn a [[Peabody Award]].<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-private-life-of-plants Peabody Award Citation: The Private Life of Plants (1995)]</ref>\n\nPrompted by an enthusiastic [[ornithology|ornithologist]] at the BBC Natural History Unit, Attenborough then turned his attention to the animal kingdom and in particular, birds. As he was neither an obsessive [[birdwatching|twitcher]] nor a bird expert, he decided he was better qualified to make ''[[The Life of Birds]]'' (1998) on the theme of behaviour. The documentary series won a second [[Peabody Award]] the following year.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-life-of-birds-by-david-attenborough 59th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2000.</ref> The order of the remaining \"Life\" series was dictated by developments in camera technology. For ''[[The Life of Mammals]]'' (2002), [[low-light photography|low-light]] and [[infrared photography|infrared]] cameras were deployed to reveal the behaviour of nocturnal mammals. The series contains a number of memorable [[two shot]]s of Attenborough and his subjects, which included chimpanzees, a [[blue whale]] and a [[grizzly bear]]. Advances in [[macro photography]] made it possible to capture natural behaviour of very small creatures for the first time, and in 2005, ''[[Life in the Undergrowth]]'' introduced audiences to the world of invertebrates.\n\nAt this point, Attenborough realised that he had spent 20 years unconsciously assembling a collection of programmes on all the major groups of terrestrial animals and plants \u2013 only reptiles and amphibians were missing. When ''[[Life in Cold Blood]]'' was broadcast in 2008, he had the satisfaction of completing the set, brought together in a DVD encyclopaedia called ''[[Life on Land]]''. In an interview that year, Attenborough was asked to sum up his achievement, and responded:\n\n{{quotation|The evolutionary history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said \"Don't be ridiculous!\" These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will come along and tell it much better than I did, but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still have something to say about the world we live in.<ref name=\"rtimes2\">''Radio Times'' 26 Jan\u20131 February 2008: \"The Last Word\", interview with Jeremy Paxman</ref>}}\n\nHowever, in 2010 Attenborough asserted that his ''[[First Life (TV series)|First Life]]'' \u2013 dealing with evolutionary history before ''Life on Earth'' \u2013 should also be included within the \"Life\" series. In the documentary ''[[Attenborough's Journey]]'', he stated, \"This series, to a degree which I really didn't fully appreciate until I started working on it, really completes the set.\"<ref>''Attenborough's Journey'', BBC Two, 24 October 2010</ref>\n\n===Other documentaries===\n[[File:David Attenborough Great Barrier Reef screening.jpg|thumb|right|Attenborough at a special screening of ''[[Great Barrier Reef (2015 TV series)|Great Barrier Reef]]'' in 2015]]\nAlongside the \"Life\" series, Attenborough has continued to work on other television documentaries, mainly in the natural history genre. He wrote and presented a series on man's influence on the natural history of the Mediterranean basin, ''[[The First Eden]]'', in 1987. Two years later, he demonstrated his passion for fossils in ''[[Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives]]''.\n\nAttenborough narrated every episode of ''[[Wildlife on One]]'', a [[BBC One]] wildlife series that ran for 253 episodes between 1977 and 2005. At its peak, it drew a weekly audience of eight to ten million, and the 1987 episode \"Meerkats United\" was voted the best wildlife documentary of all time by BBC viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/151/Meerkats+United.html |title=Meerkats United |publisher=WildFilmistory.org |accessdate=20 January 2010}}</ref> He has also narrated over 50 episodes of ''[[Natural World (BBC TV series)|Natural World]]'', BBC Two's flagship wildlife series. (Its forerunner, ''[[The World About Us]]'', was created by Attenborough in 1969, as a vehicle for colour television.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/madeintheuk/pdfs/5_david_attenborough_where_the_wild_things_are.pdf |title=\"Where the Wild Things Are\" (Essay for BBC \"Made in the Uk\") |publisher=BBC |first=David |last=Attenborough |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805031208/http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/policies/madeintheuk/pdfs/5_david_attenborough_where_the_wild_things_are.pdf|archivedate=5 August 2011 |accessdate=20 January 2010}}</ref>) In 1997, he narrated the ''[[BBC Wildlife Specials]]'', each focussing on a charismatic species, and screened to mark the Natural History Unit's 40th anniversary.\n\nAs a writer and narrator, Attenborough continued to collaborate with the BBC Natural History Unit in the new millennium. [[Alastair Fothergill]], a senior producer with whom Attenborough had worked on ''The Trials of Life'' and ''Life in the Freezer'', was making ''[[The Blue Planet]]'' (2001), the Unit's first comprehensive series on [[marine life]]. He decided not to use an on-screen presenter due to difficulties in speaking to a camera through diving apparatus, but asked Attenborough to narrate the films. The same team reunited for ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]'' (2006), the biggest nature documentary ever made for television and the first BBC wildlife series to be shot in [[high-definition video|high definition]]. In 2009, he co-wrote and narrated ''[[Life (BBC TV series)|Life]]'', a ten-part series focussing on extraordinary animal behaviour,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/21/bbc.television1|title=Attenborough is back \u2013 again|last=Holmwood|first=Leigh|date=21 September 2007|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref> and narrated ''[[Nature's Great Events]]'', which showed how seasonal changes trigger major natural spectacles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/01_january/05/nature.shtml|title=Nature's Great Events Press Pack|date=11 February 2009|publisher=BBC Press Office}}</ref> In 2011, Fothergill gave Attenborough a more prominent role in ''[[Frozen Planet]]'', a major series on the natural history of the polar regions; Attenborough appeared on screen and authored the final episode, in addition to performing voiceover duties. Attenborough introduced and narrated the Unit's first [[Ultra-high-definition television|4K]] production ''[[Life Story (TV series)|Life Story]].'' For ''[[Planet Earth II]]'' (2016), Attenborough returned as narrator and presenter, with the main theme music composed by [[Hans Zimmer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/planet-earth-two|title=Sir David Attenborough to present brand new landmark natural history series for BBC One|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=22 February 2016|accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02544td|title=Planet Earth II \u2013 BBC One|publisher=BBC|access-date=21 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2014, the corporation announced a trio of new one-off Attenborough documentaries as part of a raft of new natural history programmes. \"Attenborough's Paradise Birds\" and \"Attenborough's Big Birds\" was shown on BBC Two and \"Waking Giants\", which follows the discovery of giant dinosaur bones in South America, aired on BBC One.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29641107|title=David Attenborough to examine ostriches and dinosaurs|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2014|date=16 October 2014}}</ref> The BBC also commissioned [[Atlantic Productions]] to make a three-part, Attenborough-fronted series [[Great Barrier Reef (2015 TV series)|Great Barrier Reef]] in 2015.

In ''[[State of the Planet]]'' (2000), he used the latest scientific evidence and interviews with leading scientists and conservationists to assess the impact of man's activities on the natural world. He later turned to the issues of [[global warming]] (''[[The Truth about Climate Change]]'', 2006) and human population growth (''How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?'', 2009). He also contributed a programme which highlighted the plight of [[endangered species]] to the BBC's ''[[Saving Planet Earth]]'' project in 2007, the 50th anniversary of the Natural History Unit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=66138 |title=IBC Honours BBC Natural History Unit For Contribution To Wildlife Film |date=21 September 2007 |publisher=4rfv.co.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108102754/http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=66138 |archivedate=8 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAttenborough also forged a partnership with Sky, working on documentaries for the broadcaster's new 3D network, [[Sky 3D]].

And [I ask them], 'Are you telling me that the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, are you saying that God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child's eyeball?

In a [[BBC Four]] interview with [[Mark Lawson]], he was asked if he at any time had any religious faith.

His most influential work, 1979's ''Life on Earth'', launched a strand of nine authored documentaries with the BBC Natural History Unit which shared the ''Life'' strand name and spanned 30 years. He narrated every episode of the long-running BBC series ''Wildlife on One'' and in his later career has voiced several high-profile BBC wildlife documentaries, among them ''The Blue Planet'' and ''Planet Earth''. He became a pioneer in the 3D documentary format with ''Flying Monsters'' in 2010.\n\n==Books==\nDavid Attenborough's work as an author has strong parallels with his broadcasting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, his published work included accounts of his animal collecting expeditions around the world, which became the ''Zoo Quest'' series. He wrote an accompanying volume to each of his nine ''Life'' documentaries, along with books on tribal art and birds of paradise. His autobiography, ''Life on Air'', was published in 2002, revised in 2009 and is one of a number of his works which is available as a self-narrated audiobook. Attenborough has also contributed forewords and introductions to many other works, notably those accompanying ''Planet Earth'', ''Frozen Planet'', ''Africa'' and other BBC series he has narrated.\n\n===Bibliography===\n* ''[[Zoo Quest#Books|Zoo Quest to Guyana]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[Zoo Quest#Books|Zoo Quest for a Dragon]]'' (1957) \u2013 republished in 1959 to include an additional 85 pages titled ''Quest for the Paradise Birds''\n* ''[[Zoo Quest#Books|Zoo Quest in Paraguay]]'' (1959)\n* ''[[Zoo Quest#Books|Quest in Paradise]]'' (1960)\n* ''People of Paradise'' (1960)\n* ''[[Zoo Quest#Books|Zoo Quest to Madagascar]]'' (1961)\n* ''[[Zoo Quest#Books|Quest Under Capricorn]]'' (1963)\n* ''Fabulous Animals'' (1975)\n* ''The Tribal Eye'' (1976)\n* ''[[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]]'' (1979)\n* ''Discovering Life on Earth'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Living Planet]]'' (1984)\n* ''The First Eden: The Mediterranean World and Man'' (1987)\n* ''The Atlas of the Living World'' (1989)\n* ''[[The Trials of Life]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[The Private Life of Plants]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[The Life of Birds]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[The Life of Mammals]]'' (2002)\n* ''Life on Air: Memoirs of a Broadcaster'' (2002) \u2013 autobiography, revised in 2009\n* ''[[Life in the Undergrowth]]'' (2005)\n* ''Amazing Rare Things: The Art of Natural History in the Age of Discovery'' (2007) \u2013 with Susan Owens, Martin Clayton and Rea Alexandratos\n* ''[[Life in Cold Blood]]'' (2007)\n* ''David Attenborough's Life Stories'' (2009)\n* ''David Attenborough's New Life Stories'' (2011)\n* ''Drawn From Paradise: The Discovery, Art and Natural History of the Birds of Paradise'' (2012) \u2013 with [[Errol Fuller]]\n* ''Adventures of a Young Naturalist: The Zoo Quest Expeditions'' (2017)\n* ''Journeys to the Other Side of the World: Further Adventures of a Young Naturalist'' (2018)\n* ''Dynasties: The Rise and Fall of Animal Families'' with [[Stephen Moss]] (BBC Books, 2018) {{ISBN|978-1785943010}}\n\n==Audio recordings==\n* ''[[Tarka the Otter]]'' by [[Henry Williamson]] (available on audiocassette, 1978)\n* ''Yanomamo'' (musical entertainment, 1983) by [[Peter Rose and Anne Conlon]]; on-stage narration and published audio recording\n* ''Ocean World'' (musical entertainment, 1990) by Peter Rose and Anne Conlon; on-stage narration (including at The [[Royal Festival Hall]]), for audio recording and video broadcast (both published)\n* ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' for [[BBC Music Magazine]] (free CD with the June 2000 issue).\n* ''The Peregrine'' by [[J.A.

{"title_page": "Christian views on magic", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2007}}\n{{original research|date=November 2011}}\n}}\n{{short description|Christian views on magick}}\n\n'''Christian views on magick''' vary widely among [[Christian denomination|denominations]] and among individuals. Most [[Christians]] actively condemn any form of [[Magick (paranormal)|magick]] as [[satan]]ic, holding that it opens the way for [[demonic possession]]. Others simply dismiss it as [[superstition]]. Conversely, some branches of [[esoteric Christianity]] actively engage in magickal practices.\n\n==Biblical references==\n{{Main|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}\nThere are several references to [[witchcraft]] in the [[Bible]] that strongly condemn such practices. For example, {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11-12|NIV}} condemns anyone who \"..casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you\", and {{bibleref2|Exodus|22:18|NIV}} states \"Do not allow a sorceress to live\" (or in the [[King James Bible]] \"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\"). It has also been suggested that the word \"witch\" might be a mistranslation of \"poisoner.\"<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/thou-shalt-not-suffer-a-witch-to-live-a-murderous-mistranslation-1.5443682 \"Thou Shalt Not Suffer a Witch to Live: A Murderous Mistranslation?\"] by Elizabeth Sloane, at Haaretz.com, 17 August 2017.</ref> \n\nOthers point to a primitive idealist belief in a relation between bewitching and coveting, reflected in the occasional translation of the Tenth Commandment as 'Thou shalt not bewitch'.<ref>[http://apatheticagnostic.com/articles/reflections/ref04/ref065.html \"Reflections on Ethics 65: The Tenth Commandment: The Hidden Meaning of Coveting\" by Joseph Lewis (1946)], at apathetic agnostic.com, 2020.</ref> This may suggest that the prohibition related specifically to [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] or the casting of spells to unnaturally possess something.\n\nSome adherents of near-east religions acted as [[Mediumship|mediums]], channeling messages from the dead or from a [[familiar spirit]]. The Bible sometimes is translated as referring to \"necromancer\" and \"[[necromancy]]\" ({{bibleref|Deuteronomy|18:11|KJV}}). However, some lexicographers, including [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]] and Spiros Zodhiates, disagree.

For the post-Enlightenment Christians, the disbelief was based on a belief in [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]].\n\nIt was at this time, however, that Western Christianity began expanding to parts of Africa and Asia where premodern worldviews still held sway, and where belief in the power of witches and sorcerers to harm was, if anything, stronger than it had been in [[Northern Europe]]. Many [[African Initiated Church|African Independent Churches]] developed their own responses to witchcraft and sorcery.<ref name=\"Hayes\">Hayes, Stephen. 1995.

These perspectives do not claim that witches actually consciously enter into a pact with Satan because Satan is not normally believed to exist in [[Wicca]] or other modern neo-pagan witchcraft practices.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/><ref>U.S. Department of the Army, \"Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains\": \"It is very important to be aware that Wiccans do not in any way worship or believe in \"Satan\", \"the Devil\", or any similar entities.\"</ref>\n\n===Christian opposition to witchcraft===\nSeveral Christian groups continue to believe in witchcraft and view it as a negative force. Much of the criticism originates among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] groups, especially those of a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] tendency, who believe that witchcraft is a danger to children. The 2006 documentary ''[[Jesus Camp]]'', which depicts the life of young children attending [[Becky Fischer]]'s summer camp, shows Fischer condemning the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and telling the students that \"Warlocks are enemies of God\" (see also [[Religious debates over the Harry Potter series|Religious debates over the ''Harry Potter'' series]]). While Fischer's summer camp has sometimes been incorrectly identified as [[Pentecostal]], Fischer is most closely associated with the neo-Pentecostal movement known as the [[New Apostolic Reformation]]. NAR prophet Lou Engle, who serves in the NAR apostolic group The Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders, makes an extended appearance in ''Jesus Camp''.\n\nAmong Christian tendencies, the NAR is especially aggressive in efforts to counter alleged acts of witchcraft; the NAR's globally distributed \"Transformations\" pseudo-documentaries by filmmaker George Otis, Jr. show charismatic Christians creating mini-utopias by driving off \"territorial spirits\" and by banishing or even killing accused witches. During the 2008 United States presidential election, footage surfaced from a 2005 church ceremony in which a NAR apostle, Kenyan bishop Thomas Muthee laid hands on [[Sarah Palin]] and called upon God to protect her from \"every form of witchcraft\".\n\nIn 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] denounced belief in witchcraft during a visit to Angola.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7956460.stm |title=Pope warns Angola of witchcraft |date=March 21, 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-04 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nModern Christian views vary as to whether witchcraft is a ''general'' term for communion with evil, or a ''specific'' form of religious system and practice.  Christians often espouse the idea that [[Satan]] and evil are real, while condemning accusations of witchcraft found throughout history as dubious.\n\n===Magic in literature===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n{{See also|Religious debates over the Harry Potter series}}\nMagic in literature, while condemned by some Christians, is often viewed by Christians as non-evil. The key distinction would be between real-life magic and pretend magic. This view holds that in real life, practice of supernatural abilities (i.e. magic) must have a supernatural power source or origin, which would be either holy or evil. Thus born of Holy Spirit or of demons. (See [[Spiritual gift]] and [[Christian demonology]] for details on these teachings.) Thus, magic in the Biblical context would be viewed as only an act of evil, whereas in literature, pretend magic is a morally neutral tool available to conduct both good and bad behaviors.\n\nIn literature, magical abilities have many different power sources. Technological ability (science) can appear as magic.<ref>Arthur C. Clarke. \"Profiles of The Future\", 1961 (Clarke's third law)</ref> Often, wielding magic is accomplished by imposing one's will by concentration and/or use of devices to control an external magical force.  This explanation is offered for [[the Force]] in ''[[Star Wars]]'', magic in ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', and magic in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. \n\nThe latter two works are by notable Christians, [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], respectively. In the first book in ''The Chronicles of Narnia'', ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', Lewis specifically explains that magic is a power readily available in some other worlds, less so on Earth. The Empress Jadis (later, the [[White Witch]]) was tempted to use magic for selfish reasons to retain control of her world Charn, which ultimately led to the destruction of life there. Lewis related questions of the morality of magic to the same category as the morality of technology, including whether it is real, represents an 'unhealthy interest', or contravenes the basic divine plan for our universe.<ref>Matthew T. Dickerson, David O'Hara. \"Narnia and the Fields of Arbol: The Environmental Vision of C.S.Lewis\", 2009</ref> \n\nTolkien, a devout Catholic, had strict rules imposed by the ruling powers, angels who had assumed the 'raiment of earth', for the use of magic by their servants. These included a general discouragement of magic in all but exceptional circumstances, and also prohibitions against use of magic to control others, to set the self up as a political power, or to create a world that violates the natural order.<ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'The Istari', in \"Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth\", edited with commentary by Christopher Tolkien; published posthumously, George Allen & Unwin: 1980, pp.390-391.</ref>  He did however allow his wizard character to entertain children with magical fireworks. <ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. \"The Hobbit\", 1937; 4th edition, George Allen & Unwin, 1978: p.14</ref><ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'A long-expected party', in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", 1954; 15th impression, George Allen & Unwin, 1966, pp. 35-36.</ref>\n\n==Syncretic religions involving Christianity and magic==\n{{See also|Christianity and Neopaganism}}\nFrom the Middle Ages, many [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]] combined Christianity with [[occult]] practices (mostly [[alchemy]]). These Christo-pagan perspectives have a long history in the Middle East and Europe, from the [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonists]] and [[Templars]] right through to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Mirandola]] in the 15th century, but also through [[freemasonry]] to the early Rosicrucian [[The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Inc.|Golden Dawn]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Another notable example of syncretism is [[Santer\u00eda]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] hybrid of African [[animism]] and Christianity. There are also those who practice from a combination of Neopagan/Wiccan and Christian perspectives, as for example in [[Christian Wicca]] or in some [[Gaianism|Gaian 'Goddess' communities]]. Other modern syncretic traditions include mesoamerican folk healing traditions, such as the [[Curandero|''curanderismo'']] practices found in Mexico, and Andean folk healing traditions of Peru and Bolivia.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Evelyn Underhill]] - Anglican mystic, member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].\n*[[Arthur Machen]] - Anglican writer, member of the HOGD\n*[[Charles_Williams_(British_writer)|Charles Williams]] - Anglican theologian, mystic, member of the [[Fellowship of the Rosy Cross]].\n*[[Robert Felkin]] - Anglican missionary, ceremonical magician and occult writer, chief of the [[Stella Matutina]]\n*Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] - Author and \"[[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Christian Spiritualist]]\"\n*[[Rosicrucianism]] and [[Rose Cross]]\n* [[Thomas Ady]]\n* [[Benedicaria]]\n* [[Christianity and neopaganism]]\n* [[Christianity and Paganism]]\n* [[Christian Kabbalah]]\n* [[Christian views on astrology]]\n* [[Christian views on Freemasonry]]\n* ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]: Science as a Candle in the Dark''\n* ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]''\n*[[Enochian magic]]\n* [[Esoteric Christianity]]\n* [[Folk Catholicism]]\n* [[Folk religion#Folk Christianity|Folk Christianity]]\n* [[Magic and religion]]\n* ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]''\n* [[Nehushtan]]\n* [[Anton Praetorius]]\n* ''[[Saducismus Triumphatus]]''\n* ''[[Wonders of the Invisible World]]''\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Cohn\n  | first = Norman\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Europe's inner demons\n  | publisher = Sussex University Press\n  | year = 1975\n  | location = London\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-435-82183-0 }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Fox\n  | first = Robin Lane\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Pagans and Christians\n  | publisher = Knopf\n  | year = 1987\n  | location = New York\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-394-55495-7 }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Hutton\n  | first = Ronald\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Pagan religions of the ancient British Isles\n  | publisher = Blackwell\n  | year = 1991\n  | location = Oxford\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780631172888\n  | doi = \n  | isbn = 0-631-17288-2\n  | url-access = registration\n  }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Williams\n  | first = Charles\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Witchcraft\n  | publisher = Meridian\n  | year = 1959\n  | location = New York\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =  }}\n\n==Further reading==\n''Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts of Ritual Power'' by Marvin W.

Conversely, some branches of [[esoteric Christianity]] actively engage in magical practices.\n\n==Biblical references==\n{{Main|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}\nThere are several references to [[witchcraft]] in the [[Bible]] that strongly condemn such practices. For example, {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:11-12|NIV}} condemns anyone who \"..casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you\", and {{bibleref2|Exodus|22:18|NIV}} states \"Do not allow a sorceress to live\" (or in the [[King James Bible]] \"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\"). It has also been suggested that the word \"witch\" might be a mistranslation of \"poisoner.\"<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/thou-shalt-not-suffer-a-witch-to-live-a-murderous-mistranslation-1.5443682 \"Thou Shalt Not Suffer a Witch to Live: A Murderous Mistranslation?\"] by Elizabeth Sloane, at Haaretz.com, 17 August 2017.</ref> \n\nOthers point to a primitive idealist belief in a relation between bewitching and coveting, reflected in the occasional translation of the Tenth Commandment as 'Thou shalt not bewitch'.<ref>[http://apatheticagnostic.com/articles/reflections/ref04/ref065.html \"Reflections on Ethics 65: The Tenth Commandment: The Hidden Meaning of Coveting\" by Joseph Lewis (1946)], at apathetic agnostic.com, 2020.</ref> This may suggest that the prohibition related specifically to [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] or the casting of spells to unnaturally possess something.\n\nSome adherents of near-east religions acted as [[Mediumship|mediums]], channeling messages from the dead or from a [[familiar spirit]]. The Bible sometimes is translated as referring to \"necromancer\" and \"[[necromancy]]\" ({{bibleref|Deuteronomy|18:11|KJV}}). However, some lexicographers, including [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]] and Spiros Zodhiates, disagree. These scholars say that the Hebrew word ''kashaph'', used in Exodus 22:18 and 5 other places in the [[Tanakh]] comes from a root meaning \"to whisper\".

There was great uncertainty in distinguishing practices of vain superstition, blasphemous occultism, and perfectly sound scholarly knowledge or pious ritual.

But the reasons for disbelief differed from those of early Christians. For the early Christians the reason was theological\u2014that Christ had already defeated the powers of evil. For the post-Enlightenment Christians, the disbelief was based on a belief in [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]].\n\nIt was at this time, however, that Western Christianity began expanding to parts of Africa and Asia where premodern worldviews still held sway, and where belief in the power of witches and sorcerers to harm was, if anything, stronger than it had been in [[Northern Europe]]. Many [[African Initiated Church|African Independent Churches]] developed their own responses to witchcraft and sorcery.<ref name=\"Hayes\">Hayes, Stephen. 1995. Christian responses to witchcraft and sorcery, in Missionalia, Vol. 23(3) November.

These perspectives do not claim that witches actually consciously enter into a pact with Satan because Satan is not normally believed to exist in [[Wicca]] or other modern neo-pagan witchcraft practices.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/><ref>U.S. Department of the Army, \"Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains\": \"It is very important to be aware that Wiccans do not in any way worship or believe in \"Satan\", \"the Devil\", or any similar entities.\"</ref>\n\n===Christian opposition to witchcraft===\nSeveral Christian groups continue to believe in witchcraft and view it as a negative force. Much of the criticism originates among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] groups, especially those of a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] tendency, who believe that witchcraft is a danger to children. The 2006 documentary ''[[Jesus Camp]]'', which depicts the life of young children attending [[Becky Fischer]]'s summer camp, shows Fischer condemning the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and telling the students that \"Warlocks are enemies of God\" (see also [[Religious debates over the Harry Potter series|Religious debates over the ''Harry Potter'' series]]). While Fischer's summer camp has sometimes been incorrectly identified as [[Pentecostal]], Fischer is most closely associated with the neo-Pentecostal movement known as the [[New Apostolic Reformation]]. NAR prophet Lou Engle, who serves in the NAR apostolic group The Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders, makes an extended appearance in ''Jesus Camp''.\n\nAmong Christian tendencies, the NAR is especially aggressive in efforts to counter alleged acts of witchcraft; the NAR's globally distributed \"Transformations\" pseudo-documentaries by filmmaker George Otis, Jr. show charismatic Christians creating mini-utopias by driving off \"territorial spirits\" and by banishing or even killing accused witches. During the 2008 United States presidential election, footage surfaced from a 2005 church ceremony in which a NAR apostle, Kenyan bishop Thomas Muthee laid hands on [[Sarah Palin]] and called upon God to protect her from \"every form of witchcraft\".\n\nIn 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] denounced belief in witchcraft during a visit to Angola.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7956460.stm |title=Pope warns Angola of witchcraft |date=March 21, 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-04 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nModern Christian views vary as to whether witchcraft is a ''general'' term for communion with evil, or a ''specific'' form of religious system and practice.  Christians often espouse the idea that [[Satan]] and evil are real, while condemning accusations of witchcraft found throughout history as dubious.\n\n===Magic in literature===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n{{See also|Religious debates over the Harry Potter series}}\nMagic in literature, while condemned by some Christians, is often viewed by Christians as non-evil. The key distinction would be between real-life magic and pretend magic. This view holds that in real life, practice of supernatural abilities (i.e. magic) must have a supernatural power source or origin, which would be either holy or evil. Thus born of Holy Spirit or of demons. (See [[Spiritual gift]] and [[Christian demonology]] for details on these teachings.) Thus, magic in the Biblical context would be viewed as only an act of evil, whereas in literature, pretend magic is a morally neutral tool available to conduct both good and bad behaviors.\n\nIn literature, magical abilities have many different power sources. Technological ability (science) can appear as magic.<ref>Arthur C. Clarke. \"Profiles of The Future\", 1961 (Clarke's third law)</ref> Often, wielding magic is accomplished by imposing one's will by concentration and/or use of devices to control an external magical force.  This explanation is offered for [[the Force]] in ''[[Star Wars]]'', magic in ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', and magic in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. \n\nThe latter two works are by notable Christians, [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], respectively. In the first book in ''The Chronicles of Narnia'', ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', Lewis specifically explains that magic is a power readily available in some other worlds, less so on Earth. The Empress Jadis (later, the [[White Witch]]) was tempted to use magic for selfish reasons to retain control of her world Charn, which ultimately led to the destruction of life there. Lewis related questions of the morality of magic to the same category as the morality of technology, including whether it is real, represents an 'unhealthy interest', or contravenes the basic divine plan for our universe.<ref>Matthew T. Dickerson, David O'Hara. \"Narnia and the Fields of Arbol: The Environmental Vision of C.S.Lewis\", 2009</ref> \n\nTolkien, a devout Catholic, had strict rules imposed by the ruling powers, angels who had assumed the 'raiment of earth', for the use of magic by their servants. These included a general discouragement of magic in all but exceptional circumstances, and also prohibitions against use of magic to control others, to set the self up as a political power, or to create a world that violates the natural order.<ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'The Istari', in \"Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth\", edited with commentary by Christopher Tolkien; published posthumously, George Allen & Unwin: 1980, pp.390-391.</ref>  He did however allow his wizard character to entertain children with magical fireworks. <ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. \"The Hobbit\", 1937; 4th edition, George Allen & Unwin, 1978: p.14</ref><ref>Tolkien, J.R.R. 'A long-expected party', in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", 1954; 15th impression, George Allen & Unwin, 1966, pp. 35-36.</ref>\n\n==Syncretic religions involving Christianity and magic==\n{{See also|Christianity and Neopaganism}}\nFrom the Middle Ages, many [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]] combined Christianity with [[occult]] practices (mostly [[alchemy]]). These Christo-pagan perspectives have a long history in the Middle East and Europe, from the [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonists]] and [[Templars]] right through to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Mirandola]] in the 15th century, but also through [[freemasonry]] to the early Rosicrucian [[The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Inc.|Golden Dawn]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Another notable example of syncretism is [[Santer\u00eda]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] hybrid of African [[animism]] and Christianity. There are also those who practice from a combination of Neopagan/Wiccan and Christian perspectives, as for example in [[Christian Wicca]] or in some [[Gaianism|Gaian 'Goddess' communities]]. Other modern syncretic traditions include mesoamerican folk healing traditions, such as the [[Curandero|''curanderismo'']] practices found in Mexico, and Andean folk healing traditions of Peru and Bolivia.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Evelyn Underhill]] - Anglican mystic, member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].\n*[[Arthur Machen]] - Anglican writer, member of the HOGD\n*[[Charles_Williams_(British_writer)|Charles Williams]] - Anglican theologian, mystic, member of the [[Fellowship of the Rosy Cross]].\n*[[Robert Felkin]] - Anglican missionary, ceremonical magician and occult writer, chief of the [[Stella Matutina]]\n*Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] - Author and \"[[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Christian Spiritualist]]\"\n*[[Rosicrucianism]] and [[Rose Cross]]\n* [[Thomas Ady]]\n* [[Benedicaria]]\n* [[Christianity and neopaganism]]\n* [[Christianity and Paganism]]\n* [[Christian Kabbalah]]\n* [[Christian views on astrology]]\n* [[Christian views on Freemasonry]]\n* ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]: Science as a Candle in the Dark''\n* ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]''\n*[[Enochian magic]]\n* [[Esoteric Christianity]]\n* [[Folk Catholicism]]\n* [[Folk religion#Folk Christianity|Folk Christianity]]\n* [[Magic and religion]]\n* ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]''\n* [[Nehushtan]]\n* [[Anton Praetorius]]\n* ''[[Saducismus Triumphatus]]''\n* ''[[Wonders of the Invisible World]]''\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Cohn\n  | first = Norman\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Europe's inner demons\n  | publisher = Sussex University Press\n  | year = 1975\n  | location = London\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-435-82183-0 }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Fox\n  | first = Robin Lane\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Pagans and Christians\n  | publisher = Knopf\n  | year = 1987\n  | location = New York\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-394-55495-7 }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Hutton\n  | first = Ronald\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Pagan religions of the ancient British Isles\n  | publisher = Blackwell\n  | year = 1991\n  | location = Oxford\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780631172888\n  | doi = \n  | isbn = 0-631-17288-2\n  | url-access = registration\n  }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Williams\n  | first = Charles\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Witchcraft\n  | publisher = Meridian\n  | year = 1959\n  | location = New York\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =  }}\n\n==Further reading==\n''Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts of Ritual Power'' by Marvin W.

Capt. Foley's company was ordered to extricate another company of the battalion. Moving through the dense jungle to aid the besieged unit, Company A encountered a strong enemy force occupying well concealed, defensive positions, and the company's leading element quickly sustained several casualties. Capt. Foley immediately ran forward to the scene of the most intense action to direct the company's efforts. Deploying 1 platoon on the flank, he led the other 2 platoons in an attack on the enemy in the face of intense fire. During this action both radio operators accompanying him were wounded. At grave risk to himself he defied the enemy's murderous fire, and helped the wounded operators to a position where they could receive medical care. As he moved forward again 1 of his machine gun crews was wounded. Seizing the weapon, he charged forward firing the machine gun, shouting orders and rallying his men, thus maintaining the momentum of the attack. Under increasingly heavy enemy fire he ordered his assistant to take cover and, alone, Capt. Foley continued to advance firing the machine gun until the wounded had been evacuated and the attack in this area could be resumed. When movement on the other flank was halted by the enemy's fanatical defense, Capt. Foley moved to personally direct this critical phase of the battle. Leading the renewed effort he was blown off his feet and wounded by an enemy grenade. Despite his painful wounds he refused medical aid and persevered in the forefront of the attack on the enemy redoubt. He led the assault on several enemy gun emplacements and, single-handedly, destroyed 3 such positions. His outstanding personal leadership under intense enemy fire during the fierce battle which lasted for several hours, inspired his men to heroic efforts and was instrumental in the ultimate success of the operation.

Through dialogue, three philosophers named Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes debate the nature of [[God]]'s existence. Whether or not these names reference specific philosophers, ancient or otherwise, remains a topic of scholarly dispute. While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity.\n\nIn the ''Dialogues'', Hume's characters debate a number of [[argument]]s for the [[existence of God]], and arguments whose proponents believe through which we may come to know the nature of God. Such topics debated include the [[argument from design]]\u2014for which Hume uses a house\u2014and whether there is more suffering or good in the world ([[argument from evil]]).\n\nHume started writing the ''Dialogues'' in 1750 but did not complete them until 1776, shortly before his death.

It sometimes also includes [[shirataki]] noodles, and is sometimes topped with a raw [[Egg (food)|egg]] or a soft poached egg ([[onsen tamago]]). A very popular food in Japan, it is commonly served with [[beni sh\u014dga]] (pickled ginger), [[shichimi]] (ground [[chili pepper]]), and a side dish of [[miso soup]]. ''Gy\u016b'' is the Chinese letter for cow, and ''don'' is short for ''[[donburi]]'', the Japanese word for \"bowl\".\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n[[File:Yoshinoya Kumamoto Japan.jpg|thumb|Yoshinoya in [[Kumamoto]] city]]\nDue to the [[Meiji Restoration]] and subsequent westernization, western customs like eating beef were adopted and spread throughout Japan.\n\nGy\u016bdon is considered to have come from [[Sukiyaki]]-don and the old dish gy\u016bnabe, where thin slices of beef are cooked with vegetables in a pot, and at some point was put over rice and served in a bowl.\n\nIn 1862, the [[Kant\u014d region]]'s version of gy\u016bnabe became the first popular version of this dish. In 1899 Eikichi Matsuda opened the first [[Yoshinoya]] restaurant, at the fish market in Tokyo's [[Nihonbashi]] district.\n\nFrom the [[Taish\u014d era]] (1912~) until the early [[Sh\u014dwa era]] (1926~), the use of cheap beef and the popularity of food sold from carts outdoors ([[yatai (retail)|yatai]]) in places like [[Asakusa]] boosted the popularity of the dish.\n\nAlthough traces of the traditional sukiyaki can be found in some gy\u016bdon containing ingredients such as [[konjac]], grilled tofu, and green onions, most major food chains serve it as beef with onion.\n\n== Fast food ==\n[[Image:MATSUYA FOODS in Japan 101.jpg|thumb|right|''\"[[Matsuya Foods Co.|Matsuya]]\"'' is a major gy\u016bdon chain in Japan. The restaurant opens round the clock ('24H').]]\n[[File:Foods ticket machine of Matsuya.jpg|thumb|Food ticket machine in ''Matsuya'']]\n\nGy\u016bdon can be found in many restaurants in Japan and some [[fast food]] chains specialize exclusively in the dish.  The largest gy\u016bdon chain in Japan is  [[Sukiya (restaurant chain)|Sukiya]]. Other large chains are [[Yoshinoya]] and [[Matsuya Foods Co.|Matsuya]]. [[Matsuya Foods Co.|Matsuya]] sells gy\u016bdon under the name ''gy\u016bmeshi'' (\u725b\u3081\u3057). Many of these chain shops open round the clock.\n\nSome gy\u016bdon chains charge for [[miso soup]], but many of them serve complimentary miso soup for customers who are eating in. The major gy\u016bdon restaurant chain that offers free miso soup is Matsuya, whereas other major chains like Sukiya offer it as a part of a set or combo.\n\n=== Customer specifications ===\n{{Original Research|section|date=May 2013}}\nThere are chains that allow customers to specify how their gy\u016bdon is served with code phrases like ''tsuyudaku'' (extra [[wikt:tsuyu|tsuyu]] broth) at no extra charge.  However, this service is only for people eating in confines of the restaurant.\n\n''Tsuyudaku'', in regards to gy\u016bdon, is jargon that refers to one kind of specification where the juice and tsuyu mixture is served in large amounts.  ''Tsuyunuki'' is where the amount of tsuyu is specified to be less than usual.  Also, the term ''tsuyudakudaku'' is code for a larger amount of tsuyu.\n\nSometimes, as with ''tsuyudakudakudaku'' (\"dripping with soupiness\"), people will request that the daku, or amount of tsuyu, be exceedingly increased.\n\nThere's a theory that says '''daku''' comes from the '''taku''' part of ''takusan'' (eng: many / a lot) which, when doubled as in ''daku-daku'', is also the [[onomatopoeia]] (imitative word) for the sound of dripping.\n\nThe origin of tsuyudaku comes from Japanese businessmen ([[salaryman]]) on their morning commute to work who, due to time restrictions, ask for extra soupy gy\u016bdon (''gy\u016bdon tsuyu ome ni'') so that they can eat it quickly.  \n\nThis trend became so common, that the term ''tsuyudaku'' quickly spread among proprietors of popular gy\u016bdon chains.\n\n== Beef ban ==\n[[File:Sukiya Glow (38266162006).jpg|thumb|[[Sukiya (restaurant chain)|Sukiya]]]]\nAs a consequence of the fear of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] and a ban on imports of beef from the [[United States]], Yoshinoya and most competitors were forced to terminate gy\u016bdon sales in [[Japan]] on February 11, 2004. [[Yoshinoya]] moved its business to a similar dish made with pork instead of beef, which it named ''[[butadon]]'' (\u8c5a\u4e3c). [[Sukiya (restaurant chain)|Sukiya]] continued to serve gy\u016bdon (using [[Australia]]n beef) and also added a dish, ''tondon'', equivalent to Yoshinoya's ''butadon'', to its menu.

The earliest known mechanical musical instruments date back to 9th-century Baghdad. In [[Flanders]], in the early 13th century, a bell ringer invented a cylinder with pins which operate cams, which then hit the bells. (See below.) The popular device best known to us today as a \u201cmusic box\u201d developed from musical [[Decorative boxes#Snuff box|snuff box]]es of the 18th century and were originally called ''carillons \u00e0 musique'' (French for \"chimes of music\"). Some of the more complex boxes also contain a tiny [[drum]] and/or [[bell]]s in addition to the metal comb.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8543.jpg|thumb|Typical table music box, with six interchangeable cylinders]]\nThe original snuff boxes were tiny containers which could fit into a gentleman's waistcoat pocket. The music boxes could have any size from that of a hat box to a large piece of furniture, but most were tabletop specimens. They were usually powered by [[clockwork]] and originally produced by artisan [[watchmaker]]s. For most of the 19th century, the bulk of music box production was concentrated in Switzerland, building upon a strong watchmaking tradition. The first music box factory was opened there in 1815 by J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Recordon and Samuel Junod. There were also a few manufacturers in Bohemia and Germany. By the end of the 19th century, some of the European makers had opened factories in the United States.\n\nThe cylinders were normally made of metal and powered by a spring. In some of the costlier models, the cylinders could be removed to change melodies, thanks to an invention by Paillard in 1862, which was perfected by Metert of Geneva in 1879.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In some exceptional models, there were four springs, to provide continuous play for up to three hours.\n\n[[File:CIMA mg 8302.jpg|thumb|Music box using the metal disk system]]\nThe very first boxes at the end of the 18th century made use of metal disks. The switchover to cylinders seems to have been completed after the Napoleonic wars. In the last decades of the 19th century, however, mass-produced models such as the [[Polyphon]] and others all made use of interchangeable metal disks instead of cylinders. The cylinder-based machines rapidly became a minority.\n\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8498.jpg|thumb|Mechanical piano combined with strings. There are three violins each with only one string. Thus, only tunes that do not require the missing fourth string can be played.]]\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8461.jpg|thumb|[[Orchestrion]]]]\nThe term \"music box\" is also applied to clockwork devices where a removable metal disk or cylinder was used only in a \"programming\" function without producing the sounds directly by means of pins and a comb. Instead, the cylinder (or disk) worked by actuating bellows and levers which fed and opened pneumatic valves which activated a modified [[wind instrument]] or plucked the chords on a modified [[string instrument]]. Some devices could do both at the same time and were often combinations of player pianos and music boxes, such as the [[Orchestrion]].\n\nThere were many variations of large music machines, usually built for the affluent of the pre-phonograph 19th century.\n\nThe [https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771 Symphonium] company started business in 1885 as the first manufacturers of disc-playing music boxes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771|title=Hose, K.

No other disc-playing musical box exists in so many varieties.  \u00a0 The company also pioneered the use of electric motors...the first model fitted with an electric motor being advertised in 1900. The company moved into the piano-orchestrion business and made both disc-operated and barrel-playing models, player-pianos and phonographs.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile,  Polyphon expanded to America. where Brachhausen established the [[Regina Company|Regina Company.]] Regina was a spectacular success (see Wikipedia article). It eventually reinvented itself as a maker of vacuums and steam cleaners. \n\nIn the heyday of the music box, some variations were as tall as a grandfather clock and all used interchangeable large disks to play different sets of tunes. These were spring-wound and driven and both had a bell-like sound. The machines were often made in England, Italy, and the US, with additional disks made in Switzerland, Austria, and Prussia. Early \"juke-box\" pay versions of them existed in public places. Marsh's free Museum and curio shop in [[Long Beach, Washington]] (US) has several still-working versions of them on public display. The [[Musical Museum, Brentford]], [[London]] has a number of machines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |title=musicalmuseum.co.uk |access-date=2011-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426035303/http://musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |archive-date=2011-04-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Morris Museum in Morristown, New Jersey, USA has a notable collection, including interactive exhibits. In addition to video and audio footage of each piece, the actual instruments are demonstrated for the public daily on a rotational basis.<ref>[http://morrismuseum.org/wordpress/mechanical-musical-instruments-automata/ morrismuseum.org]</ref> \n\nAt the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, most music boxes were gradually replaced by [[player piano]]s, which were louder and more versatile and melodious, when kept tuned, and by the smaller [[phonograph|gramophone]]s which had the advantage of playing back voices. Regina produced combinations of these devices. Escalating labour costs increased the price and further reduced volume. Now modern automation is helping to bring music box prices back down.\n\nCollectors prize surviving music boxes from the 19th century and the early 20th century as well as new music boxes being made today in several countries (see \"Evolving Box Production\", below). Inexpensive, small windup music box movements (including the cylinder and comb and the spring) that  add a bit of music to mass-produced jewellery boxes and novelty items are now produced in countries with low labour costs.\n\nMany kinds of music box movements are available to the home craft person, locally or through online retailers.

Regina, whose boxes are renowned among collectors for their tone, becomes a success and some 100,000 are sold before sales cease in 1921.\n\nEarly 20th century: The invention of the phonograph, the [[First World War]] and the economic crisis in the '20s bring down Sainte-Croix's main industry and make the luxury music box completely disappear.\n\n[[File:Caja musica.jpg|thumb|Music box with dancing ballerina]]\nBetween the two world wars most of the Swiss companies converted to the manufacture of other products requiring precise mechanical parts. Some went back to making watches, others were eventually responsible for the famous [[Bolex]] [[movie camera]]s and the Hermes [[typewriter]]s. Some simply sold out to Reuge.\n\nLocated near [[Lake Neuch\u00e2tel]], Reuge is one of the last of the Swiss survivors making music boxes of all sizes and shapes, with or without [[automaton]]s in a modern style with clear acrylic sides to see the mechanical operation. They have in a sense branched out widely from their original cylinder offerings since they also offered traditional-looking music boxes with removable metal disks for around 1,000 euros, with each disk costing in the neighborhood of 14 euros. The higher range boxes with removable cylinders and small assorted tables made of fine woods can cost up to 34,000 euros and about an equivalent number of US dollars. They also sell several models of clear acrylic paperweights with a music box movement inside, for a minimum of about 250 euros. They have, however, discontinued the smaller movements. Old Reuge music boxes are worth thousands of dollars but even so, cannot be compared to the fabulously large and highly complex music boxes which were produced in nineteenth-century Switzerland by legendary makers such as Nicole Fr\u00e8res or Paillard. Since approximatively 2007 Reuge developed a strong business in the world of \"bespoke\" customized pieces for leaders in business and politics.\n\n[http://www.nidec-sankyo.co.jp/english/index.html Nidec Sankyo] in Japan started up in the aftermath of World War II, using the latest in automation. Modern production methods resulted in reasonable prices, producing company growth. Sankyo started with small movements, introduced 50-note movements by the late 1970s, and in 2006 is producing disc boxes playing discs as large as 16\" (with two 80-note combs and reminiscent of the \"Mira\") and are also working on a dual-cylinder 100-note movement. Sankyo now offers a wide variety of music boxes in Japan, and supplies movements to many other manufacturers and distributors. Some of these sell them retail (even online) to hobbyists for as low as 3 euros each. Sankyo Seiki bills itself as the biggest manufacturer of music boxes in the world and advertises that it controls 50% of the market. Recently, it has started selling licences for its musical-box tunes to [[cellular phone]] companies, for use as ring tones. The company is an industrial concern which also makes magnetic and hologram card readers, appliance components, industrial robots and miniature motors of all kinds.\n\nThe Porter Music Box company of [[Vermont]] produces steel disc music boxes in several formats. They offer clockwork, spring-wound models as well as electric ones. They stand out by their continuing production of discs, with a selection of about a thousand tunes. The discs can also be played on many antique music boxes bearing the Polyphon and Regina brand names.\n\nThe small 18-note musical movements are now being made almost exclusively in countries with low labour costs such as [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]. Many of these productions are used in mobiles, children's musical toys, and jewellery boxes.\n\nIn March 2016, the band Wintergatan released a video of their homemade [[Wintergatan#Marble Machine|Marble Machine]] which took 14 months to make and played in any key using a 3,000-piece wooden construction fueled by 2,000 marbles. Band member [[Martin Molin]] used a hand crank to mobilize the marbles, which then created various noises on a vibraphone and other installed musical elements. <ref>\"[http://indiebandguru.com/wintergatan-marble-machine-amazes/ Wintergatan Marble Machine \u2013 A Feat of Both Music and Engineering]\", indiebandguru.com, Retrieved March 3, 2016</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Tevofy Technology Ltd., based in Taiwan, released the first app-controlled mechanical music box called [https://web.archive.org/web/20190626073605/https://murobox.com/en/index.html Muro Box], which stands for Music Robot in a Box. Unlike traditional music box, people do not need to punch holes to compose songs on a paper-strip music box. Also, there is no minimum order for making customized music box movement to play a selected song. Muro Box gives more freedom in composing songs and choosing songs to play on a music box. <ref>\u201cMuro Box Story.\u201d Muro Box, 26 June 2019, murobox.com/en/story/index.html.</ref>\n[[File:Muro Box.jpg|thumb|Muro Box, the first app-controlled music box.]]\n\n== Coin-operated models ==\n\nIn [[Switzerland]], coin-operated music boxes, usually capable of playing several tunes, were installed in places such as train stations and amusement parks. Some of the models had a mechanism for automatically changing the metal disks. These were, in a sense, the precursors to [[jukebox]]. However, they soon disappeared from their intended venues and were displaced by the jukebox, which could produce a greater variety of sounds and full songs rather than warped fragments.\n\nBecause most of the coin-operated music boxes were built for rough treatment (such as slapping and kicking by a customer), many of these large models have survived into the 21st century, despite their relatively low production quantities. They are sought by collectors who have the space for their large or very large cabinets.\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Music box elements.jpg|thumb|The ratchet lever [1] rotates the cylinder [2], the pins pluck the comb teeth [3] which produces the music. The whole thing rests on the bedplate [4].]]\n[[File:Music box with detachable handle - 2.jpg|thumb|Small fifty-tone musical box with detachable handle, possibly circa 1900]]\n[[File:How a Wind Up Music Box Works.webm|thumb|Explainer video]]\n*The bedplate is the relatively heavy metal foundation on which all the other pieces are fastened, usually by screws.\n*The ratchet lever or the windup key is used to put the spring motor under tension, which is to wind it up.\n*The spring motor or motors (two or more can be used to make playing times longer) give anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more of playing time.\n*The comb is a flat piece of metal with dozens or even hundreds of tuned teeth, or 'reeds', of different lengths.\n*The cylinder is the programming object, a metallic version of a [[punched card]] which instead of having holes to express a program, is studded with tiny pins at the correct spacing to produce music by displacing the teeth of the comb at the correct time. The tines of the comb 'ring', or sound, as they slip off the pins. The disc in a disc music box plays this function, with pins perpendicular to the plane surface.\n*Multiple-tune cylinders have more than one set of pins intertwined on the same cylinder, with, for example, the B pins for a second song lying halfway between the B and C pins of the first song, etc. Offsetting the cylinder slightly relative to the comb brings the different set of pins into contact with the teeth, thereby playing an alternate piece of music. Many modern music boxes will have as many as four sets of pins intertwined, with a mechanism automatically shifting the cylinder from one song or movement to the next.\n\n==Repertoire==\nIn 1974\u201375, German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] composed ''[[Tierkreis (Stockhausen)|Tierkreis]]'', a set of twelve pieces on the signs of the [[zodiac]], for twelve music boxes.<ref>Peter Andraschke, \"Kompositorische Tendenzen bei Karlheinz Stockhausen seit 1965\", in ''Zur Neuen Einfachheit in der Musik'', Studien zur Wertungsforschung 14, edited by Otto Kolleritsch, 126\u201343 (Vienna and Graz: Universal Edition [for the Institut f\u00fcr Wertungsforschung an der Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und darstellende Kunst in Graz], 1981). {{ISBN|3-7024-0153-9}}.</ref><ref>Giuliano d'Angiolini, \"''Tierkreis'', oeuvre pour instrument m\u00e9lodique et/ou harmonique: un tournant dans le parcours musical de Stockhausen\", ''Analyse Musicale'' (1989, 1er trimestre): 68\u201373.</ref><ref>Hermann Conen, ''Formel-Komposition: Zu Karlheinz Stockhausens Musik der siebziger Jahre'', K\u00f6lner Schriften zur Neuen Musik 1, edited by [[Johannes Fritsch]] and [[Dietrich K\u00e4mper]].

The earliest known mechanical musical instruments date back to 9th-century Baghdad. In [[Flanders]], in the early 13th century, a bell ringer invented a cylinder with pins which operate cams, which then hit the bells. (See below.) The popular device best known to us today as a \u201cmusic box\u201d developed from musical [[Decorative boxes#Snuff box|snuff box]]es of the 18th century and were originally called ''carillons \u00e0 musique'' (French for \"chimes of music\"). Some of the more complex boxes also contain a tiny [[drum]] and/or [[bell]]s in addition to the metal comb.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8543.jpg|thumb|Typical table music box, with six interchangeable cylinders]]\nThe original snuff boxes were tiny containers which could fit into a gentleman's waistcoat pocket. The music boxes could have any size from that of a hat box to a large piece of furniture, but most were tabletop specimens. They were usually powered by [[clockwork]] and originally produced by artisan [[watchmaker]]s. For most of the 19th century, the bulk of music box production was concentrated in Switzerland, building upon a strong watchmaking tradition. The first music box factory was opened there in 1815 by J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Recordon and Samuel Junod. There were also a few manufacturers in Bohemia and Germany. By the end of the 19th century, some of the European makers had opened factories in the United States.\n\nThe cylinders were normally made of metal and powered by a spring. In some of the costlier models, the cylinders could be removed to change melodies, thanks to an invention by Paillard in 1862, which was perfected by Metert of Geneva in 1879.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In some exceptional models, there were four springs, to provide continuous play for up to three hours.\n\n[[File:CIMA mg 8302.jpg|thumb|Music box using the metal disk system]]\nThe very first boxes at the end of the 18th century made use of metal disks. The switchover to cylinders seems to have been completed after the Napoleonic wars. In the last decades of the 19th century, however, mass-produced models such as the [[Polyphon]] and others all made use of interchangeable metal disks instead of cylinders. The cylinder-based machines rapidly became a minority.\n\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8498.jpg|thumb|Mechanical piano combined with strings. There are three violins each with only one string. Thus, only tunes that do not require the missing fourth string can be played.]]\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8461.jpg|thumb|[[Orchestrion]]]]\nThe term \"music box\" is also applied to clockwork devices where a removable metal disk or cylinder was used only in a \"programming\" function without producing the sounds directly by means of pins and a comb. Instead, the cylinder (or disk) worked by actuating bellows and levers which fed and opened pneumatic valves which activated a modified [[wind instrument]] or plucked the chords on a modified [[string instrument]]. Some devices could do both at the same time and were often combinations of player pianos and music boxes, such as the [[Orchestrion]].\n\nThere were many variations of large music machines, usually built for the affluent of the pre-phonograph 19th century.\n\nThe [https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771 Symphonium] company started business in 1885 as the first manufacturers of disc-playing music boxes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771|title=Hose, K.

No other disc-playing musical box exists in so many varieties.  \u00a0 The company also pioneered the use of electric motors...the first model fitted with an electric motor being advertised in 1900. The company moved into the piano-orchestrion business and made both disc-operated and barrel-playing models, player-pianos and phonographs.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile,  Polyphon expanded to America. where Brachhausen established the [[Regina Company|Regina Company.]] Regina was a spectacular success (see Wikipedia article). It eventually reinvented itself as a maker of vacuums and steam cleaners. \n\nIn the heyday of the music box, some variations were as tall as a grandfather clock and all used interchangeable large disks to play different sets of tunes. These were spring-wound and driven and both had a bell-like sound. The machines were often made in England, Italy, and the US, with additional disks made in Switzerland, Austria, and Prussia. Early \"juke-box\" pay versions of them existed in public places. Marsh's free Museum and curio shop in [[Long Beach, Washington]] (US) has several still-working versions of them on public display. The [[Musical Museum, Brentford]], [[London]] has a number of machines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |title=musicalmuseum.co.uk |access-date=2011-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426035303/http://musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |archive-date=2011-04-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Morris Museum in Morristown, New Jersey, USA has a notable collection, including interactive exhibits.

Regina produced combinations of these devices. Escalating labour costs increased the price and further reduced volume. Now modern automation is helping to bring music box prices back down.\n\nCollectors prize surviving music boxes from the 19th century and the early 20th century as well as new music boxes being made today in several countries (see \"Evolving Box Production\", below). Inexpensive, small windup music box movements (including the cylinder and comb and the spring) that  add a bit of music to mass-produced jewellery boxes and novelty items are now produced in countries with low labour costs.\n\nMany kinds of music box movements are available to the home craft person, locally or through online retailers.

Some simply sold out to Reuge.\n\nLocated near [[Lake Neuch\u00e2tel]], Reuge is one of the last of the Swiss survivors making music boxes of all sizes and shapes, with or without [[automaton]]s in a modern style with clear acrylic sides to see the mechanical operation. They have in a sense branched out widely from their original cylinder offerings since they also offered traditional-looking music boxes with removable metal disks for around 1,000 euros, with each disk costing in the neighborhood of 14 euros. The higher range boxes with removable cylinders and small assorted tables made of fine woods can cost up to 34,000 euros and about an equivalent number of US dollars. They also sell several models of clear acrylic paperweights with a music box movement inside, for a minimum of about 250 euros. They have, however, discontinued the smaller movements. Old Reuge music boxes are worth thousands of dollars but even so, cannot be compared to the fabulously large and highly complex music boxes which were produced in nineteenth-century Switzerland by legendary makers such as Nicole Fr\u00e8res or Paillard.

Many of these productions are used in mobiles, children's musical toys, and jewellery boxes.\n\nIn March 2016, the band Wintergatan released a video of their homemade [[Wintergatan#Marble Machine|Marble Machine]] which took 14 months to make and played in any key using a 3,000-piece wooden construction fueled by 2,000 marbles. Band member [[Martin Molin]] used a hand crank to mobilize the marbles, which then created various noises on a vibraphone and other installed musical elements. <ref>\"[http://indiebandguru.com/wintergatan-marble-machine-amazes/ Wintergatan Marble Machine \u2013 A Feat of Both Music and Engineering]\", indiebandguru.com, Retrieved March 3, 2016</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Tevofy Technology Ltd., based in Taiwan, released the first app-controlled mechanical music box called [https://web.archive.org/web/20190626073605/https://murobox.com/en/index.html Muro Box], which stands for Music Robot in a Box. Unlike traditional music box, people do not need to punch holes to compose songs on a paper-strip music box. Also, there is no minimum order for making customized music box movement to play a selected song. Muro Box gives more freedom in composing songs and choosing songs to play on a music box. <ref>\u201cMuro Box Story.\u201d Muro Box, 26 June 2019, murobox.com/en/story/index.html.</ref>\n[[File:Muro Box.jpg|thumb|Muro Box, the first app-controlled music box.]]\n\n== Coin-operated models ==\n\nIn [[Switzerland]], coin-operated music boxes, usually capable of playing several tunes, were installed in places such as train stations and amusement parks. Some of the models had a mechanism for automatically changing the metal disks. These were, in a sense, the precursors to [[jukebox]]. However, they soon disappeared from their intended venues and were displaced by the jukebox, which could produce a greater variety of sounds and full songs rather than warped fragments.\n\nBecause most of the coin-operated music boxes were built for rough treatment (such as slapping and kicking by a customer), many of these large models have survived into the 21st century, despite their relatively low production quantities. They are sought by collectors who have the space for their large or very large cabinets.\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Music box elements.jpg|thumb|The ratchet lever [1] rotates the cylinder [2], the pins pluck the comb teeth [3] which produces the music. The whole thing rests on the bedplate [4].]]\n[[File:Music box with detachable handle - 2.jpg|thumb|Small fifty-tone musical box with detachable handle, possibly circa 1900]]\n[[File:How a Wind Up Music Box Works.webm|thumb|Explainer video]]\n*The bedplate is the relatively heavy metal foundation on which all the other pieces are fastened, usually by screws.\n*The ratchet lever or the windup key is used to put the spring motor under tension, which is to wind it up.\n*The spring motor or motors (two or more can be used to make playing times longer) give anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more of playing time.\n*The comb is a flat piece of metal with dozens or even hundreds of tuned teeth, or 'reeds', of different lengths.\n*The cylinder is the programming object, a metallic version of a [[punched card]] which instead of having holes to express a program, is studded with tiny pins at the correct spacing to produce music by displacing the teeth of the comb at the correct time. The tines of the comb 'ring', or sound, as they slip off the pins. The disc in a disc music box plays this function, with pins perpendicular to the plane surface.\n*Multiple-tune cylinders have more than one set of pins intertwined on the same cylinder, with, for example, the B pins for a second song lying halfway between the B and C pins of the first song, etc. Offsetting the cylinder slightly relative to the comb brings the different set of pins into contact with the teeth, thereby playing an alternate piece of music. Many modern music boxes will have as many as four sets of pins intertwined, with a mechanism automatically shifting the cylinder from one song or movement to the next.\n\n==Repertoire==\nIn 1974\u201375, German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] composed ''[[Tierkreis (Stockhausen)|Tierkreis]]'', a set of twelve pieces on the signs of the [[zodiac]], for twelve music boxes.<ref>Peter Andraschke, \"Kompositorische Tendenzen bei Karlheinz Stockhausen seit 1965\", in ''Zur Neuen Einfachheit in der Musik'', Studien zur Wertungsforschung 14, edited by Otto Kolleritsch, 126\u201343 (Vienna and Graz: Universal Edition [for the Institut f\u00fcr Wertungsforschung an der Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und darstellende Kunst in Graz], 1981). {{ISBN|3-7024-0153-9}}.</ref><ref>Giuliano d'Angiolini, \"''Tierkreis'', oeuvre pour instrument m\u00e9lodique et/ou harmonique: un tournant dans le parcours musical de Stockhausen\", ''Analyse Musicale'' (1989, 1er trimestre): 68\u201373.</ref><ref>Hermann Conen, ''Formel-Komposition: Zu Karlheinz Stockhausens Musik der siebziger Jahre'', K\u00f6lner Schriften zur Neuen Musik 1, edited by [[Johannes Fritsch]] and [[Dietrich K\u00e4mper]].

The [[principality]] became part of the scattered holdings of the [[house of Orange-Nassau]] from the time that [[William the Silent]] inherited the title of [[Prince of Orange]] from his [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon|cousin]] in 1544, until it was finally ceded to [[France]] in 1713 under the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]].  Although permanently lost by the Nassaus then, this fief gave its name to the extant [[House of Orange|Royal House of the Netherlands]]. The area of the principality was approximately {{Convert|12|mi}} long by {{Convert|9|mi}} wide, or {{Convert|108|mi2}}.<ref>{{cite book\n  | author=George Ripley And Charles A.

The Baux counts of Orange became fully independent with the breakup of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] after 1033. In 1163 Orange was raised to a principality, as a [[fief]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nIn 1365, Orange university was founded by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] when he was in [[Arles]] for his coronation as [[king of Arles]].\n[[File:Oranje1547.png|thumb|left|Orange within papal [[Comtat Venaissin]] as of 1547]]\nIn 1431 the Count of Provence waived taxation duties for Orange's rulers ([[Mary of Baux-Orange]] and [[John III of Chalon-Arlay|Jean de Ch\u00e2lons]] of Burgundy) in exchange for liquid assets to be used for a ransom. The town and principality of Orange was a part of administration and province of [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nIn 1544, [[William the Silent]], count of [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]], with large properties in the Netherlands, inherited the principality. William, 11 years old at the time, was the cousin of [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon]] who died without an heir when he was shot at St. Dizier in 1544 during the Franco-Imperial wars.  Ren\u00e9, it turned out, willed his entire fortune to this very young relative. Among those titles and estates was the Principality of Orange.  Ren\u00e9's mother, Claudia, had held the title prior to it being passed to young William since Philibert de Ch\u00e2lon was her brother.\n\nWhen William inherited the Principality, it was incorporated into the holdings of what became the [[House of Orange]]. This pitched it into the [[Protestant]] side in the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], during which the town was badly damaged. In 1568 the [[Eighty Years' War]] began with William as [[Stadtholder]] of Holland leading the bid for independence of the Netherlands from Spain. William the Silent was assassinated in [[Delft]] in 1584. It was his son, [[Maurice of Nassau]] (Prince of Orange after his elder brother died in 1618), with the help of [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], who solidified the independence of the Dutch republic.\n\nAs an independent enclave within France, Orange became an attractive destination for Protestants and a [[Huguenot]] stronghold. William III of Orange, who ruled England as [[William III of England]], was the last Prince of Orange to rule the principality. The principality was captured by the forces of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] under Fran\u00e7ois Adh\u00e9mar de Monteil [[Comte de Grignan]], in 1672 during the [[Franco-Dutch War]], and again in August 1682, but William did not concede his claim to rule.  In 1702, William III died childless and the right to the principality became a matter of dispute between [[Frederick I of Prussia]] and [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange|John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz]], who both claimed the title 'Prince of Orange'.  In 1702 also, Louis XIV of France enfeoffed [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince of Conti]], a relative of the Ch\u00e2lon dynasty, with the Principality of Orange, so that there were three claimants to the title.\n\nFinally in 1713 in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]], Frederick I of Prussia ceded the Principality to France (without surrendering the princely title) in which cession the Holy Roman Empire as suzerain concurred, though John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, the other claimant to the principality, did not concur. Only in 1732, with the [[Treaty of Partage]], did John William Friso's successor [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], renounce all his claims to the territory, but again (like Frederick I) he did not renounce his claim to the title. In the same treaty an agreement was made between both claimants, stipulating that both houses be allowed to use the title.\n\nIn 1713, after Orange was officially ceded to France, it became a part of the Province of the [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nFollowing the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, Orange was absorbed into the French ''d\u00e9partement'' of [[Dr\u00f4me]] in 1790, then [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], then finally [[Vaucluse]].\n\nIn 1814 after the defeat of Napoleon, the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] was not revived but replaced into the [[Kingdom of the United Netherlands]], under a King of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. In 1815 the [[Congress of Vienna]] took care of a French sensitivity by stipulating that the Kingdom of the Netherlands would be ruled by the [[House of Oranje-Nassau]] \u2013 \"Oranje\", not \"Orange\" as had been the custom until then.

The [[principality]] became part of the scattered holdings of the [[house of Orange-Nassau]] from the time that [[William the Silent]] inherited the title of [[Prince of Orange]] from his [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon|cousin]] in 1544, until it was finally ceded to [[France]] in 1713 under the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]].  Although permanently lost by the Nassaus then, this fief gave its name to the extant [[House of Orange|Royal House of the Netherlands]]. The area of the principality was approximately {{Convert|12|mi}} long by {{Convert|9|mi}} wide, or {{Convert|108|mi2}}.<ref>{{cite book\n  | author=George Ripley And Charles A.

The Baux counts of Orange became fully independent with the breakup of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] after 1033. In 1163 Orange was raised to a principality, as a [[fief]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nIn 1365, Orange university was founded by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] when he was in [[Arles]] for his coronation as [[king of Arles]].\n[[File:Oranje1547.png|thumb|left|Orange within papal [[Comtat Venaissin]] as of 1547]]\nIn 1431 the Count of Provence waived taxation duties for Orange's rulers ([[Mary of Baux-Orange]] and [[John III of Chalon-Arlay|Jean de Ch\u00e2lons]] of Burgundy) in exchange for liquid assets to be used for a ransom. The town and principality of Orange was a part of administration and province of [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nIn 1544, [[William the Silent]], count of [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]], with large properties in the Netherlands, inherited the principality. William, 11 years old at the time, was the cousin of [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon]] who died without an heir when he was shot at St. Dizier in 1544 during the Franco-Imperial wars.  Ren\u00e9, it turned out, willed his entire fortune to this very young relative. Among those titles and estates was the Principality of Orange.  Ren\u00e9's mother, Claudia, had held the title prior to it being passed to young William since Philibert de Ch\u00e2lon was her brother.\n\nWhen William inherited the Principality, it was incorporated into the holdings of what became the [[House of Orange]]. This pitched it into the [[Protestant]] side in the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], during which the town was badly damaged. In 1568 the [[Eighty Years' War]] began with William as [[Stadtholder]] of Holland leading the bid for independence of the Netherlands from Spain. William the Silent was assassinated in [[Delft]] in 1584. It was his son, [[Maurice of Nassau]] (Prince of Orange after his elder brother died in 1618), with the help of [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], who solidified the independence of the Dutch republic.\n\nAs an independent enclave within France, Orange became an attractive destination for Protestants and a [[Huguenot]] stronghold. William III of Orange, who ruled England as [[William III of England]], was the last Prince of Orange to rule the principality. The principality was captured by the forces of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] under Fran\u00e7ois Adh\u00e9mar de Monteil [[Comte de Grignan]], in 1672 during the [[Franco-Dutch War]], and again in August 1682, but William did not concede his claim to rule.  In 1702, William III died childless and the right to the principality became a matter of dispute between [[Frederick I of Prussia]] and [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange|John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz]], who both claimed the title 'Prince of Orange'.  In 1702 also, Louis XIV of France enfeoffed [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince of Conti]], a relative of the Ch\u00e2lon dynasty, with the Principality of Orange, so that there were three claimants to the title.\n\nFinally in 1713 in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]], Frederick I of Prussia ceded the Principality to France (without surrendering the princely title) in which cession the Holy Roman Empire as suzerain concurred, though John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, the other claimant to the principality, did not concur. Only in 1732, with the [[Treaty of Partage]], did John William Friso's successor [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], renounce all his claims to the territory, but again (like Frederick I) he did not renounce his claim to the title. In the same treaty an agreement was made between both claimants, stipulating that both houses be allowed to use the title.\n\nIn 1713, after Orange was officially ceded to France, it became a part of the Province of the [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nFollowing the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, Orange was absorbed into the French ''d\u00e9partement'' of [[Dr\u00f4me]] in 1790, then [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], then finally [[Vaucluse]].\n\nIn 1814 after the defeat of Napoleon, the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] was not revived but replaced into the [[Kingdom of the United Netherlands]], under a King of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. In 1815 the [[Congress of Vienna]] took care of a French sensitivity by stipulating that the Kingdom of the Netherlands would be ruled by the [[House of Oranje-Nassau]] \u2013 \"Oranje\", not \"Orange\" as had been the custom until then.
