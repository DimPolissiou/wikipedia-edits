[[Vladivostok]] was operational only during the summer, whereas [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]], a naval base in Liaodong Province leased to Russia by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, was operational all year. Since the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, Japan feared Russian encroachment on its plans to create a [[sphere of influence]] in Korea and Manchuria. Russia had demonstrated an expansionist policy in the [[Siberia]]n [[Russian Far East|Far East]] from the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]] in the 16th century.{{sfn|Steinberg|2008|p=2}}\n\nSeeing Russia as a rival, Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in [[Manchuria]] in exchange for recognition of Korea as being within the Japanese sphere of influence. Russia refused and demanded Korea north of the [[39th parallel north|39th parallel]] to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan. The Japanese government perceived a Russian threat to their plans for expansion into [[Asia]] and chose to go to war. After negotiations broke down in 1904, the Japanese Navy opened hostilities by attacking the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur, China, in a surprise attack.\n\nRussia suffered multiple defeats by Japan, but [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] was convinced that Russia would win and chose to remain engaged in the war; at first, to await the outcomes of certain naval battles, and later to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a \"humiliating peace\". Russia ignored Japan's willingness early on to agree to an armistice and rejected the idea to bring the dispute to the Arbitration Court at The Hague. The war concluded with the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], mediated by US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. The complete victory of the Japanese military surprised world observers. The consequences transformed the balance of power in [[East Asia]], resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. It was the first major military victory in the modern era of an Asian power over a [[Europe]]an one. Scholars continue to debate the historical significance of the war.\n\n== Historical background ==\n\n=== Modernization of Japan ===\n[[File:Kisabur\u014d Ohara, Europe and Asia Octopus Map, 1904 Cornell CUL PJM 1145 01.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.2|An anti-Russian satirical map produced by a Japanese student at [[Keio University]] during the Russo-Japanese War. It follows the design used for a similar map first published in 1877.<ref>\"[[c:File:Serio-comic war map for 1877.jpg|Serio-comic war map for the year 1877]]\" by Frederick W. Rose (publisher not identified).</ref>]]\n\nAfter the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, the Meiji government endeavored to assimilate [[Western world|Western]] ideas, technological advances and ways of warfare. By the late 19th century, Japan had transformed itself into a modernized industrial state. The Japanese wanted to be recognized as equal with the Western powers. The Meiji Restoration had been intended to make Japan a modernized state, not a Westernized one, and Japan was an imperialist power, looking towards overseas expansionism.{{sfn|Storry|1979|pp=15\u20136}}\n\nIn the years 1869\u201373, the ''[[Seikanron]]'' (\"Conquer Korea Argument\") had bitterly divided the Japanese elite between one faction that wanted to conquer Korea immediately vs. another that wanted to wait until Japan was more modernized before embarking on a war to conquer Korea; significantly no one in the Japanese elite ever accepted the idea that the Koreans had the right to be independent, with only the question of timing dividing the two factions.{{sfn|Storry|1979|p=16}} In much the same way that Europeans used the \"backwardness\" of African and Asian nations as a reason for why they had to conquer them, for the Japanese elite the \"backwardness\" of China and Korea was proof of the inferiority of those nations, thus giving the Japanese the \"right\" to conquer them.<ref name=\"Storry1979_17\">{{harvnb|Storry|1979|p=17}}.</ref>\n\n[[Inoue Kaoru|Inouye Kaoru]], the Foreign Minister, gave a speech in 1887 saying \"What we must do is to transform our empire and our people, make the empire like the countries of Europe and our people like the peoples of Europe,\" going on to say that the Chinese and Koreans had essentially forfeited their right to be independent by not modernizing.{{r|Storry1979_17}} Much of the pressure for an aggressive foreign policy in Japan came from below, with the advocates of [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement|\"people's rights\" movement]] calling for an elected parliament also favoring an ultra-nationalist line that took it for granted the Japanese had the \"right\" to annex Korea, as the \"people's right\" movement was led by those who favored invading Korea in the years 1869\u201373.{{r|Storry1979_17}}\n\nAs part of the modernization process in Japan, [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinist]] ideas about the \"[[survival of the fittest]]\" were common in Japan from the 1880s onward and many ordinary Japanese resented the heavy taxes imposed by the government to modernize Japan, demanding something tangible like an overseas [[colony]] as a reward for their sacrifices.{{sfn|Storry|1979|pp=18\u20139}}\n\nFurthermore, the educational system of Meiji Japan was meant to train the schoolboys to be soldiers when they grew up, and as such, Japanese schools indoctrinated their students into ''[[Bushido|Bushid\u014d]]'' (\"the spirit of the warriors\"), the fierce code of the samurai.{{r|Storry1979_17}} Having indoctrinated the younger generations into ''Bushid\u014d'', the Meiji elite found themselves faced with a people who clamored for war, and regarded diplomacy as a weakness.{{r|Storry1979_17}}\n\n=== Pressure from the people ===\nThe British Japanologist Richard Storry wrote that the biggest misconception about Japan in the West was that the Japanese people were the \"docile\" instruments of the elite, when in fact much of the pressure for Japan's wars from 1894 to 1941 came from the ordinary people, who demanded a \"tough\" foreign policy, and tended to engage in riots and assassination when foreign policy was perceived to be pusillanimous.{{r|Storry1979_17}}\n\nThough the Meiji [[oligarchy]] refused to allow [[democracy]], they did seek to appropriate some of the demands of the \"people's rights\" movement by allowing an elected Diet in 1890 (with limited powers and an equally limited franchise) and by pursuing an aggressive foreign policy towards Korea.{{r|Storry1979_17}}\n\nIn 1884, Japan had encouraged a coup in Korea by a pro-Japanese reformist faction, which led to the conservative government calling upon China for help, leading to a clash between Chinese and Japanese soldiers in Seoul.<ref name=\"Storry1979_20\">{{harvnb|Storry|1979|p=20}}.</ref> At the time, Tokyo did not feel ready to risk a war with China, and the crisis was ended by the [[Convention of Tientsin]], which left Korea more strongly in the Chinese sphere of influence, though it did give the Japanese the right to intervene in Korea.{{r|Storry1979_20}} All through the 1880s and early 1890s, the government in Tokyo was regularly criticized for not being aggressive enough in Korea, leading Japanese historian [[Masao Maruyama (scholar)|Masao Maruyama]] to write: <blockquote>Just as Japan was subject to pressure from the Great Powers, so she would apply pressure to still weaker countries\u2014a clear case of the transfer psychology. In this regard it is significant that ever since the Meiji period demands for a tough foreign policy have come from the common people, that is, from those who are at the receiving end of oppression at home.{{r|Storry1979_20}}</blockquote>\n\n=== Russian Eastern expansion ===\nTsarist Russia, as a major imperial power, had ambitions in the East. By the 1890s it had extended its realm across [[Central Asia]] to [[Afghanistan]], absorbing local states in the process. The [[Russian Empire]] stretched from Poland in the west to the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in the east.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Growth of European and Japanese Dominions in Asia since 1801 |others=Map by Velhagen & Klasings |website=University of Texas \u2013 Perry\u2013Casta\u00f1eda Library Map Collection |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/shepherd/japan_euro_growth_1800.jpg }}</ref> With its construction of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to the port of [[Vladivostok]], Russia hoped to further consolidate its influence and presence in the region. In the [[Tsushima incident]] of 1861 Russia had directly assaulted Japanese territory.\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395) ===\n{{Main|First Sino-Japanese War}}\n[[File:Generals Pyongyang MigitaToshihide October1894.jpg|thumb|Chinese generals in [[Pyongyang]] surrender to the Japanese, October 1894.]]\n\nBetween the Meiji Restoration and its participation in [[World War I]], the Empire of Japan fought in two significant wars. The first war Japan fought was the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], fought in 1894 and 1895. The war revolved around the issue of control and influence over Korea under the rule of the [[Joseon]] dynasty. From the 1880s onward, there had been vigorous competition for influence in Korea between China and Japan.<ref name=Hwang2010_1323>{{harvnb|Hwang|2010|pp=132\u20133}}.</ref> The Korean court was prone to factionalism, and was badly divided by a reformist faction that was pro-Japanese and a more conservative faction that was pro-Chinese.{{r|Hwang2010_1323}} In 1884, a pro-Japanese coup attempt was put down by Chinese troops, and a \"residency\" under General Yuan Shikai was established in Seoul.{{r|Hwang2010_1323}} A peasant rebellion led by the [[Donghak|Tonghak]] religious movement led to a request by the Korean government for the [[Qing dynasty]] to send in troops to stabilize the country.{{r|Hwang2010_1323}} The Empire of Japan responded by sending their own force to Korea to crush the Tonghak and installed a puppet government in [[Seoul]]. China objected and war ensued. Hostilities proved brief, with Japanese ground troops routing Chinese forces on the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and nearly destroying the Chinese [[Beiyang Fleet]] in the [[Battle of the Yalu River (1894)|Battle of the Yalu River]]. Japan and China signed the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], which ceded the Liaodong Peninsula and the island of Taiwan to Japan. After the peace treaty, Russia, Germany, and France [[Triple Intervention|forced Japan to withdraw from the Liaodong Peninsula]]. The leaders of Japan did not feel that they possessed the strength to resist the combined might of Russia, Germany and France, and so gave in to the ultimatum. At the same time, the Japanese did not abandon their attempts to force Korea into the Japanese sphere of influence. On 8 October 1895, [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]] of Korea, the leader of the anti-Japanese and pro-Chinese faction at the Korean court was murdered by Japanese agents within the halls of the [[Gyeongbokgung]] palace, an act that backfired badly as it turned Korean public opinion against Japan.<ref name=Hwang2010_137>{{harvnb|Hwang|2010|p=137}}.</ref> In early 1896, King [[Gojong of Korea]] [[Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation|fled to the Russian legation]] in Seoul under the grounds that his life was in danger from Japanese agents, and Russian influence in Korea started to predominate.{{r|Hwang2010_137}} In the aftermath of the flight of the king, a popular uprising overthrew the pro-Japanese government and several cabinet ministers were lynched on the streets.{{r|Hwang2010_137}}\n\nIn 1897, Russia occupied the Liaodong Peninsula, built the [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]] fortress, and based the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Russian Pacific Fleet]] in the port. Russia's acquisition of Port Arthur was primarily an anti-British move to counter the British occupation of [[Weihai|Wei-hai-Wei]], but in Japan, this was perceived as an anti-Japanese move.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|p=8}} Germany occupied [[Jiaozhou Bay]], built the [[Siege of Tsingtao|Tsingtao fortress]], and based the [[German East Asia Squadron]] in this port. Between 1897 and 1903, the Russians built the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] (CER) in Manchuria.<ref name=Jukes2002_9>{{harvnb|Jukes|2002|p=9}}.</ref> The Chinese Eastern Railroad was owned jointly by the Russian and Chinese governments, but the company's management was entirely Russian, the line was built to the Russian gauge and Russian troops were stationed in Manchuria to protect rail traffic on the CER from bandit attacks.{{r|Jukes2002_9}} The headquarters of the CER company was located in the new Russian-built city of [[Harbin]], the \"Moscow of the Orient\". From 1897 onwards, Manchuria\u2014while still nominally part of the \"Great Qing Empire\"\u2014started to resemble more and more a Russian province.{{r|Jukes2002_9}}\n\n=== Russian encroachment ===\nIn December 1897, a [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian]] fleet appeared off Port Arthur. After three months, in 1898, China and Russia negotiated a convention by which China leased (to Russia) Port Arthur, [[Talienwan]] and the surrounding waters. The two parties further agreed that the convention could be extended by mutual agreement. The Russians clearly expected such an extension, for they lost no time in occupying the territory and in fortifying Port Arthur, their sole warm-water port on the Pacific coast and of great strategic value. A year later, to consolidate their position, the Russians began to build a new railway from [[Harbin]] through [[Mukden]] to Port Arthur, the South Manchurian Railroad.{{r|Jukes2002_9}} The development of the railway became a contributory factor to the [[Boxer Rebellion]], when [[Boxers attacks on Chinese Eastern Railway|Boxer forces burned the railway stations]].{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|p=19\u201320}}\n\nThe Russians also began to make inroads into Korea. By 1898 they had acquired mining and forestry concessions near the Yalu and Tumen rivers,{{sfn|Paine|2003|p=317}} causing the Japanese much anxiety. Japan decided to attack before the Russians completed the Trans-Siberian Railway.\n\n=== Boxer Rebellion ===\n{{Main|Boxer Rebellion}}\n{{See also|Russian invasion of Manchuria}}\n[[File:Troops of the Eight nations alliance 1900.jpg|thumb|Troops of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] in 1900. Left to right: Britain, United States, Australia, India, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Japan.]]\n\nThe Russians and the Japanese both contributed troops to the [[Eight-Nation Alliance|eight-member international force]] sent in 1900 to quell the Boxer Rebellion and to relieve the international legations under siege in the Chinese capital, Beijing. Russia had already sent 177,000 soldiers to [[Manchuria]], nominally to protect its railways under construction. The troops of the Qing Empire and the participants of the Boxer Rebellion could do nothing against such a massive army and [[Russian invasion of Manchuria|were ejected from Manchuria]]. After the Boxer Rebellion, 100,000 Russian soldiers were stationed in Manchuria.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|p=11}} The Russian troops settled in{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|p=7\u20138}} and despite assurances they would vacate the area after the crisis, by 1903 the Russians had not established a timetable for withdrawal{{sfn|Paine|2003|p=320}} and had actually strengthened their position in Manchuria.\n\n=== Pre-war negotiations ===\nThe Japanese statesman [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] started to negotiate with the Russians. He regarded Japan as too weak to evict the Russians militarily, so he proposed giving Russia control over Manchuria in exchange for Japanese control of northern Korea. Of the five ''Genr\u014d'' (elder statesmen) who made up the Meiji oligarchy, It\u014d Hirobumi and Count [[Inoue Kaoru]] were opposed to war against Russia on financial grounds while [[Katsura Tar\u014d]], [[Komura Jutar\u014d]] and Field Marshal [[Yamagata Aritomo]] favored war.{{sfn|Kat\u014d|2007|p=96}} Meanwhile, Japan and [[British Empire|Britain]] had signed the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] in 1902, the British seeking to restrict naval competition by keeping the Russian Pacific seaports of Vladivostok and Port Arthur from their full use. The alliance with the British meant, in part, that if any nation allied itself with Russia during any war against Japan, then Britain would enter the war on Japan's side. Russia could no longer count on receiving help from either Germany or France without there being a danger of British involvement in the war. With such an alliance, Japan felt free to commence hostilities, if necessary.\n\nThe 1890s and 1900s marked the height of the \"[[Yellow Peril]]\" propaganda by the German government and the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] often wrote letters to his cousin Nicholas II of Russia, praising him as the \"savior of the white race\" and urging Russia forward in Asia.<ref name=McLean2003_121>{{harvnb|McLean|2003|p=121}}.</ref><ref name=Fiebi-vonHase2003_165>{{harvnb|Fiebi-von Hase|2003|p=165}}.</ref> From November 1894 onward, Wilhelm had been writing letters praising Nicholas as Europe's defender from the \"Yellow Peril\", assuring the Tsar that God Himself had \"chosen\" Russia to defend Europe from the alleged Asian threat.{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=182}} On 1 November 1902, Wilhelm wrote to Nicholas that \"certain symptoms in the East seem to show that Japan is becoming a rather restless customer\" and \"it is evident to every unbiased mind that Korea must and will be Russian\".{{r|McLean2003_121}} Wilhelm ended his letter with the warning that Japan and China would soon unite against Europe, writing: \"Twenty to thirty million Chinese, supported by a half dozen Japanese divisions, led by competent, intrepid Japanese officers, full of hatred for Christianity\u2014that is a vision of the future that cannot be contemplated without concern, and it is not impossible. On the contrary, it is the realisation of the yellow peril, which I described a few years ago and I was ridiculed by the majority of people for my graphic depiction of it&nbsp;... Your devoted friend and cousin, Willy, Admiral of the Atlantic\".{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=183}}\n\nWilhelm aggressively encouraged Russia's ambitions in Asia as France, Russia's ally since 1894, was less than supportive of Russian expansionism in Asia, and it was believed in Berlin that German support of Russia might break up the Franco-Russian alliance and lead to a new German\u2013Russian alliance.{{r|McLean2003_121}}\nThe French, who had been Russia's closest allies since 1894, made it clear that they disapproved of Nicholas's forward policy in Asia with the French Premier [[Maurice Rouvier]] publicly declaring that the Franco-Russian alliance applied only to Europe, not Asia, and that France would remain neutral if Japan attacked Russia.{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|pp=252\u20133}} The American president [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who was attempting to mediate the Russian\u2013Japanese dispute, complained that Wilhelm's \"Yellow Peril\" propaganda, which strongly implied that Germany might go to war against Japan in support of Russia, encouraged Russian intransigence.{{sfn|Fiebi-von Hase|2003|p=163}} On 24 July 1905, in a letter to the British diplomat [[Cecil Spring Rice]], Roosevelt wrote that Wilhelm bore partial responsibility for the war as \"he has done all he could to bring it about\", charging that Wilhelm's constant warnings about the \"Yellow Peril\" had made the Russians uninterested in compromise as Nicholas believed that Germany would intervene if Japan attacked.{{sfn|Fiebi-von Hase|2003|p=163-4}}\n\nThe implicit promise of German support suggested by Wilhelm's \"Yellow Peril\" speeches and letters to Nicholas led many decision-makers in St. Petersburg to believe that Russia's military weaknesses in the Far East like the uncompleted Trans-Siberian railroad line did not matter as it was assumed the ''Reich'' would come to Russia's assistance if war should come. In fact, neither Wilhelm nor his Chancellor Prince [[Bernhard von B\u00fclow]] had much interest in East Asia, and Wilhelm's letters to Nicholas praising him as Europe's savior against the \"Yellow Peril\" were really meant to change the [[European balance of power|balance of power in Europe]] as Wilhelm believed that if Russia was embroiled with Japan, this would break up the Franco-Russian alliance and lead to Nicholas signing an alliance with Germany.{{r|Fiebi-vonHase2003_165}} This was especially the case as Germany had embarked upon the Tirpitz plan and a policy of ''[[Weltpolitik]]'' meant to challenge Britain's position as the world's leading power, and since Britain was allied to Japan, then if Russia and Japan could be manipulated into going to war with each other, that this in turn would lead to Russia turning towards Germany.{{r|Fiebi-vonHase2003_165}}\nFurthermore, Wilhelm believed if a Russian\u2013German alliance emerged, France would be compelled to join it and having Russia pursue an expansionist policy in Asia would keep Russia out of the Balkans, thus removing the main source of tension between Russia and Germany's ally Austria-Hungary.{{r|McLean2003_121}} During the war, Nicholas who took at face value Wilhelm's \"Yellow Peril\" speeches, placed much hope in German intervention on his side, and more than once, Nicholas chose to continue the war out of the belief that the Kaiser would come to his aid.{{sfn|McLean|2003|pp=127\u20138}}\n\nBy 8 April 1903, Russia was supposed to have completed its withdrawal of its forces in Manchuria that it had dispatched to crush the Boxer Rebellion, but that day passed with no reductions in Russian forces in Manchuria.{{sfn|Kat\u014d|2007|p=102}} In Japan, university students demonstrated against both Russia and their own government for not taking any action.{{sfn|Kat\u014d|2007|p=102}} On 28 July 1903, [[Shinichiro Kurino|Kurino Shin'ichir\u014d]], the Japanese minister in [[St. Petersburg]], was instructed to present his country's view opposing Russia's consolidation plans in Manchuria. On 3 August, the Japanese minister handed in the following document to serve as the basis for further negotiations:<ref>{{cite book |title=Baron Komura to Mr. Kurino |date=3 August 1903 }} in {{harvnb|Correspondence Regarding Negotiations|1904|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/correspondencere00japarich#page/7/mode/1up 7\u20139]}}.</ref>\n# Mutual engagement to respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Chinese and Korean empires and to maintain the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce and industry of all nations in those countries.\n# Reciprocal recognition of Japan's preponderating interests in Korea and Russia's special interests in railway enterprises in Manchuria, and of the right of Japan to take in Korea and of Russia to take in Manchuria such measures as may be necessary for the protection of their respective interests as above defined, subject, however, to the provisions of article I of this agreement.\n# Reciprocal undertaking on the part of Russia and Japan not to impede development of those industrial and commercial activities respectively of Japan in Korea and of Russia in Manchuria, which are not inconsistent with the stipulations of article I of this agreement.

and Russia, Russia scaled back its demands and claims regarding Korea bit by bit, making a series of concessions that Japan regarded as serious compromises on Russia's part\".<ref

name=Kat\u014d2007_101>{{harvnb|Kat\u014d|2007|p=101}}.</ref> The Korean and Manchurian issues had become linked as the Prime Minister [[Katsura Tar\u014d]] decided if war did come, that Japan was more likely to have the support of the United States and Great Britain if the war could be presented as a struggle for free trade against the highly protectionist Russian empire, in which case, Manchuria, which was the larger market than Korea, was more likely to engage Anglo-American sympathies.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_101}} Throughout the war, a recurring theme of Japanese propaganda was Japan was a \"civilized\" power that supported free trade and would implicitly allow foreign businesses into the resource-rich region of Manchuria vs. Russia the \"uncivilized\" power that was protectionist and wanted to keep the riches of Manchuria all to itself.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_101}}\n\nEmperor Gojong of Korea came to believe that the issue dividing Japan and Russia was Manchuria, and chose to pursue a policy of neutrality as the best way of preserving Korean independence as the crisis mounted.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_978}} Hu Weide, the Chinese minister in St. Petersburg in a series of reports to Beijing looked closely at whether a Russian or a Japanese victory would be favorable to China, and argued that the latter was preferable, as he maintained a Japanese victory presented the better chance for China to regain sovereignty over Manchuria.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_978}} In December 1903, China decided to remain neutral if war came, because though Japan was the only power capable of evicting Russia from Manchuria, the extent of Japanese ambitions in Manchuria was not clear in Beijing.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_978}}\n\nIn the Russian\u2013Japanese negotiations then followed, although by early January 1904, the Japanese government had realised that Russia was not interested in settling the [[Manchuria]]n or Korean issues. Instead, Russia's goal was buying time \u2013 via diplomacy \u2013 to further build up militarily.<ref name=KodaNWCR2005>{{Cite journal |last=Koda |first=Yoji |title=The Russo-Japanese War: Primary Causes of Japanese Success |journal=[[Naval War College Review]]  |volume=58 |issue=2 |date=Spring 2005 |via=Questia Online Library |url-access=subscription |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-840737501 }}</ref> In December 1903, Wilhelm wrote in a marginal note on a diplomatic dispatch about his role in inflaming Russo-Japanese relations:<blockquote>Since 97\u2014Kiaochow\u2014we have never left Russia in any doubt that we would cover her back in Europe, in case she decided to pursue a bigger policy in the Far East that might lead to military complications (with the aim of relieving our eastern border from the fearful pressure and threat of the massive Russian army!). Whereupon, Russia took Port Arthur and ''trusting us'', took her fleet ''out of the Baltic'', thereby making herself ''vulnerable to us'' by sea. In Danzig 01 and Reval 02, the same assurance was given again, with result that entire Russian divisions from Poland and European Russia were and are being sent to the Far East. This would not had happened if our governments had not been in agreement!{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=164}}</blockquote>\nA recurring theme of Wilhelm's letters to Nicholas was that \"Holy Russia\" had been \"chosen\" by God to save the \"entire white race\" from the \"Yellow Peril\", and that Russia was \"entitled\" to annex all of Korea, Manchuria, and northern China up to Beijing.{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=263}} Wilhelm went on to assure Nicholas that once Russia had defeated Japan that this would be a deadly blow to British diplomacy, and the two emperors, the self-proclaimed \"Admiral of the Atlantic\" and the \"Admiral of the Pacific\" would rule Eurasia together, making them able to challenge British sea power as the resources of Eurasia would make their empires immune to a British blockade, which would thus allow Germany and Russia to \"divide up the best\" of the British colonies in Asia between them.{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=263}}\n\nNicholas had been prepared to compromise with Japan, but after receiving a letter from Wilhelm attacking him as a coward for his willingness to compromise with the Japanese (whom Wilhelm never ceasing reminding Nicholas represented the \"Yellow Peril\") for the sake of peace, become more obstinate.<ref name=R\u00f6hl2014_269>{{harvnb|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=269}}.</ref> Wilhelm had written to Nicholas stating that the question of Russian interests in Manchuria and Korea was beside the point, saying instead it was a matter of Russia<blockquote>undertaking the protection and defense of the White Race, and with it, Christian civilization, against the Yellow Race. And whatever the Japs are determined to ensure the domination of the Yellow Race in East Asia, to put themselves at its head and organise and lead it into battle against the White Race. That is the kernel of the situation, and therefore there can be very little doubt about where the sympathies of all half-way intelligent Europeans should lie. England betrayed Europe's interests to America in a cowardly and shameful way over the Panama Canal question, so as to be left in 'peace' by the Yankees. Will the 'Tsar' likewise betray the interests of the White Race to the Yellow as to be 'left in peace' and not embarrass the Hague tribunal too much?.{{r|R\u00f6hl2014_269}}</blockquote>\nWhen Nicholas replied that he still wanted peace, Wilhelm wrote back in a telegram \"You innocent angel!\", telling his advisors \"This is the language of an innocent angel. But not that of a White Tsar!\".{{r|R\u00f6hl2014_269}} Nevertheless, the belief in Tokyo was that Russia was not serious about seeking a peaceful solution to the dispute, on 13 January 1904, Japan proposed a formula by which Manchuria would be outside the Japanese sphere of influence and, reciprocally, Korea outside Russia's. On 21 December 1903, the Tar\u014d cabinet voted to go to war against Russia.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_101}}\n\n[[File:Shinichiro Kurino.jpg|thumb|Kurino Shin'ichir\u014d]]\n\nBy 4 February 1904, no formal reply had been received and on 6 February the Japanese minister to Russia, [[Shinichiro Kurino|Kurino Shin'ichir\u014d]] was recalled, and Japan severed diplomatic relations with Russia.{{r|KodaNWCR2005}}\n\nPotential diplomatic resolution of territorial concerns between Japan and Russia failed; historians have argued that this directly resulted from the actions of Tsar [[Nicholas II]]. One crucial error of Nicholas was his mismanagement of government. Although certain scholars contend the situation arose from the determination of Tsar Nicholas II to use the war against Japan to spark a revival in Russian patriotism, no historical evidence supports this claim.{{sfn|Esthus|1981|p=411}} The Tsar's advisors did not support the war, foreseeing problems in transporting troops and supplies from European Russia to the East.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tolf |first=Robert W. |year=1976 |title=The Russian Rockfellers |publisher=Hoover Press |isbn=0-8179-6583-1 |p=156 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3DmsQLtWq1wC }}</ref> Convinced that his rule was divinely ordained and that he held responsibility to God, Nicholas II held the ideals of preserving the autocracy and defending the dignity, honor, and worth of Russia.{{sfn|Esthus|1981|p=397}} This attitude by the Tsar led to repeated delays in negotiations with the Japanese government. The Japanese understanding of this can be seen in a telegram from Japanese minister of foreign affairs, Komura, to the minister to Russia, in which he stated:\n<blockquote>\n...&nbsp;the Japanese government have at all times during the progress of the negotiations made it a special point to give prompt answers to all propositions of the Russian government. The negotiations have now been pending for no less than four months, and they have not yet reached a stage where the final issue can with certainty be predicted. In these circumstances the Japanese government cannot but regard with grave concern the situation for which the delays in negotiations are largely responsible.<ref>{{cite book |title=Baron Komura to Mr. Kurino |date=1 December 1903 }} In {{harvnb|Correspondence Regarding Negotiations|1904|p=[https://archive.org/stream/correspondencere00japarich#page/38/mode/1up 38]}}.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nErrors by Nicholas II in managing the Russian government also led to his misinterpreting the type of situation in which Russia was to become involved with Japan. Some scholars have suggested that Tsar Nicholas II dragged Japan into war intentionally, in hopes of reviving Russian nationalism. This notion is disputed by a comment made by Nicholas to Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, saying there would be no war because he \"did not wish it\".{{sfn|Schimmelpenninck van der Oye|2005|p=42}}\nThis does not reject the claim that Russia played an aggressive role in the East, which it did; rather, it means that Russia unwisely calculated that Japan would not go to war against its far larger and seemingly superior navy and army. Nicholas held the Japanese in contempt as \"yellow monkeys\", and he took for granted that the Japanese would simply yield in the face of Russia's superior power, which thus explains his unwillingness to compromise.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|pp=16\u201320}} Evidence of Russia's false sense of security and superiority to Japan is seen by Russian reference to Japan choosing war as a big mistake.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|p=21}}\n\n== Declaration of war ==\n[[File:Manchuria.png|thumb|Greater Manchuria.

He could not believe that Japan would commit an act of war without a formal declaration, and had been assured by his ministers that the Japanese would not fight. When the attack came, according to Cecil Spring Rice, first secretary at the British Embassy, it left the Tsar \"almost incredulous\".<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Spring Rice to Robert H. M.

However, [[Yuan Shikai]] sent envoys to Japanese generals several times to deliver foodstuffs and alcoholic drinks. Native Manchurians joined the war on both sides as hired troops.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|pp=84\u20135}}\n\n== Campaign of 1904 ==\nPort Arthur, on the Liaodong Peninsula in the south of Manchuria, had been fortified into a major naval base by the Russian Imperial Army. Since it needed to control the sea in order to fight a war on the Asian mainland, Japan's first military objective was to neutralize the Russian fleet at Port Arthur.\n\n=== Battle of Port Arthur ===\n{{Main|Battle of Port Arthur}}\n[[File:JAPANESE OCCUPATION OF SEOUL.jpg|thumb|Japanese infantry during the occupation of [[Seoul]], Korea, in 1904]]\n\nOn the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese fleet under Admiral [[T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d]] opened the war with a surprise [[torpedo boat destroyer]]{{sfn|Tikowara/Grant|1907|pp=12,15,17,42}} attack on the Russian ships at Port Arthur. The attack heavily damaged the ''[[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|Tsesarevich]]'' and ''[[Russian battleship Retvizan|Retvizan]]'', the heaviest battleships in Russia's far Eastern theater, and the 6,600&nbsp;ton cruiser ''[[Russian cruiser Pallada (1899)|Pallada]]''.<ref>\n{{Cite journal |last=Shaw |first=Albert |title=The Progress of the World \u2013 Japan's Swift Action |journal=The American Monthly Review of Reviews |volume=29 |issue=3 |date=March 1904 |p=260 |lccn=sn86032152 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Jr8CAAAAYAAJ }}</ref> These attacks developed into the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which Admiral T\u014dg\u014d was unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully as it was protected by the shore batteries of the harbour, and the Russians were reluctant to leave the harbour for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral [[Stepan Osipovich Makarov]] on 13 April 1904. Although the actual Battle of Port Arthur was indecisive, the initial attacks had a devastating psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident about the prospect of war. The Japanese had seized the initiative while the Russians waited in port.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThese engagements provided cover for a Japanese landing near [[Incheon]] in Korea. From Incheon the Japanese occupied Hanseong and then the rest of Korea. By the end of April, the Japanese Imperial Army under [[Kuroki Tamemoto]] was ready to cross the [[Yalu River]] into Russian-occupied Manchuria.\n\n=== Blockade of Port Arthur ===\n[[File:Battlefields in the Russo Japanese War.jpg|thumb|Battlefields in the Russo-Japanese War]]\n\nThe Japanese attempted to deny the Russians use of Port Arthur. During the night of 13\u201314 February, the Japanese attempted to block the entrance to Port Arthur by sinking several concrete-filled steamers in the deep water channel to the port,{{sfn|Tikowara/Grant|1907|p=48\u201350}} but they sank too deep to be effective. A similar attempt to block the harbour entrance during the night of 3\u20134 May also failed. In March, the charismatic Vice Admiral [[Stepan Makarov|Makarov]] had taken command of the First Russian Pacific Squadron with the intention of breaking out of the Port Arthur blockade.\n\nOn 12 April 1904, two Russian [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships, the flagship [[Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1894)|''Petropavlovsk'']] and the [[Russian battleship Pobeda|''Pobeda'']], slipped out of port but struck Japanese mines off Port Arthur. The ''Petropavlovsk'' sank almost immediately, while the ''Pobeda'' had to be towed back to port for extensive repairs. Admiral Makarov, the single most effective Russian naval strategist of the war, died on the battleship ''Petropavlovsk''.\n\nOn 15 April 1904, the Russian government made overtures threatening to seize the British [[war correspondent]]s who were taking the ship [[SS Haimun|''Haimun'']] into warzones to report for the London-based [[The Times|''Times'']] newspaper, citing concerns about the possibility of the British giving away Russian positions to the Japanese fleet.\n\nThe Russians quickly learned, and soon employed, the Japanese tactic of offensive minelaying. On 15 May 1904, two Japanese battleships, the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yashima||2}} and the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hatsuse||2}}, were lured into a recently laid Russian minefield off Port Arthur, each striking at least two mines. The ''Hatsuse'' sank within minutes, taking 450 sailors with her, while the ''Yashima'' sank while under tow towards Korea for repairs. On 23 June 1904, a [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|breakout attempt]] by the Russian squadron, now under the command of Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]], failed. By the end of the month, Japanese artillery were firing shells into the harbour.\n\n=== Siege of Port Arthur ===\n{{Main|Siege of Port Arthur}}\n[[File:Fire of the Oil Depot Caused by Our Gunfire.jpg|thumb|Bombardment during the [[Siege of Port Arthur]]]]\n\nThe Siege of Port Arthur commenced in April 1904. Japanese troops tried numerous frontal assaults on the fortified hilltops overlooking the harbour, which were defeated with Japanese casualties in the thousands. Eventually, though, with the aid of several batteries of 11-inch (280&nbsp;mm) [[28&nbsp;cm Howitzer L/10|Armstrong howitzers]], the Japanese were able to capture the key hilltop bastion in December 1904. With a spotter at the end of phone line located at this vantage point, the long-range artillery was able to shell the Russian fleet, which was unable to retaliate against the land-based artillery invisible over the other side of hilltop, and was unable or unwilling to sail out against the blockading fleet. Four Russian battleships and two cruisers were sunk in succession, with the fifth and last battleship being forced to scuttle a few weeks later. Thus, all [[capital ship]]s of the Russian fleet in the Pacific were sunk. This is probably the only example in military history when such a scale of devastation was achieved by land-based artillery against major warships.\n\n[[File:Assaut-Kin-Tch\u00e9ou.jpg|thumb|Japanese assault on the entrenched Russian forces, 1904]]\nMeanwhile, attempts to relieve the besieged city by land also failed, and, after the [[Battle of Liaoyang]] in late August, the northern Russian force that might have been able to relieve Port Arthur retreated to Mukden ([[Shenyang]]). Major General [[Anatoly Stessel]], commander of the Port Arthur garrison, believed that the purpose of defending the city was lost after the fleet had been destroyed.\nIn general, the Russian defenders were suffering disproportionate casualties each time the Japanese attacked. In particular, several large underground [[Mining (military)|mines]] were exploded in late December, resulting in the costly capture of a few more pieces of the defensive line.\nStessel, therefore, decided to surrender to the surprised Japanese generals on 2 January 1905. He made his decision without consulting either the other military staff present, or the Tsar and military command, who all disagreed with the decision. Stessel was convicted by a [[court-martial]] in 1908 and sentenced to death on account of an incompetent defense and for disobeying orders. He was later pardoned.\n\n=== Anglo\u2013Japanese intelligence co-operation ===\nEven before the war, British and Japanese intelligence had co-operated against Russia due to the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]].{{sfn|Chapman|2004|p=42}} During the war, [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] stations in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and China often intercepted and read wireless and telegraph cable traffic relating to the war, which was shared with the Japanese.{{sfn|Chapman|2004|p=55}} In their turn, the Japanese shared information about Russia with the British with one British official writing of the \"perfect quality\" of Japanese intelligence. In particular, British and Japanese intelligence gathered much evidence that Germany was supporting Russia in the war as part of a bid to disturb the balance of power in Europe, which led to British officials increasingly perceiving that country as a threat to the international order.{{sfn|Chapman|2004|pp=52\u20134}}\n\n=== Battle of Yalu River ===\n{{Main|Battle of Yalu River (1904)}}\n\nIn contrast to the Japanese strategy of rapidly gaining ground to control Manchuria, Russian strategy focused on fighting delaying actions to gain time for reinforcements to arrive via the long Trans-Siberian Railway, which was incomplete near [[Irkutsk]] at the time. On 1 May 1904, the [[Battle of Yalu River (1904)|Battle of Yalu River]] became the first major land battle of the war; Japanese troops stormed a Russian position after crossing the river. The defeat of the Russian Eastern Detachment removed the perception that the Japanese would be an easy enemy, that the war would be short, and that Russia would be the overwhelming victor.{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|p=65}} This was also the first battle in decades to be an Asian victory over a European power and marked Russia's inability to match Japan's military prowess.{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|p=86}} Japanese troops proceeded to land at several points on the Manchurian coast, and in a series of engagements, drove the Russians back towards Port Arthur. The subsequent battles, including the [[Battle of Nanshan]] on 25 May 1904, were marked by heavy Japanese losses largely from attacking entrenched Russian positions.\n\n=== Battle of the Yellow Sea ===\n{{Main|Battle of the Yellow Sea}}\n\nWith the death of Admiral [[Stepan Makarov]] during the siege of Port Arthur in April 1904, Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]] was appointed commander of the battle fleet and was ordered to make a [[sortie]] from Port Arthur and deploy his force to [[Vladivostok]]. Flying his flag in the French-built pre-dreadnought ''[[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|Tsesarevich]]'', Vitgeft proceeded to lead his six battleships, four [[cruiser]]s, and 14 [[torpedo boat destroyers]] into the Yellow Sea in the early morning of 10 August 1904. Waiting for him was Admiral T\u014dg\u014d and his fleet of four battleships, 10 cruisers, and 18 torpedo boat destroyers.\n\nAt approximately 12:15, the battleship fleets obtained visual contact with each other, and at 13:00 with T\u014dg\u014d [[Crossing the T|crossing Vitgeft's ''T'']], they commenced main battery fire at a range of about eight miles, the longest ever conducted up to that time.{{sfn|Forczyk|2009|p=50}} For about thirty minutes the battleships pounded one another until they had closed to less than four miles and began to bring their secondary batteries into play. At 18:30, a hit from one of T\u014dg\u014d's battleships struck Vitgeft's flagship's bridge, killing him instantly.\n\nWith the ''Tsesarevich''{{'}}s helm jammed and their admiral killed in action, she turned from her battle line, causing confusion among her fleet. However, T\u014dg\u014d was determined to sink the Russian flagship and continued pounding her, and it was saved only by the gallant charge of the American-built Russian battleship ''[[Russian battleship Retvizan|Retvizan]]'', whose captain successfully drew away T\u014dg\u014d's heavy fire from the Russian flagship.{{sfn|Forczyk|2009|p=53}} Knowing of the impending battle with the battleship reinforcements arriving from Russia (the Baltic Fleet), T\u014dg\u014d chose not to risk his battleships by pursuing his enemy as they turned about and headed back into Port Arthur, thus ending naval history's longest-range gunnery duel up to that time and the first modern clash of steel battleship fleets on the high seas.\n\n=== Baltic Fleet redeploys ===\n[[File:Battle of Japan Sea (Route of Baltic Fleet) NT.PNG|thumb|Route of Baltic Fleet, to and back]]\n\nMeanwhile, the Russians were preparing to reinforce their Far East Fleet by sending the [[Baltic Fleet]], under the command of Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]]. After a false start caused by engine problems and other mishaps, the squadron finally departed on 15 October 1904, and sailed halfway around the world from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the Pacific via the [[Cape Route]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in the course of a seven-month odyssey that was to attract worldwide attention. The [[Dogger Bank incident]] on 21 October 1904, where the Russian fleet fired on British fishing boats that they mistook for enemy torpedo boats, nearly sparked a war with the United Kingdom (an ally of Japan, but neutral, unless provoked). During the voyage, the fleet separated into a portion that went through the Suez Canal while the larger battleships went around the [[Cape of Good Hope]].\n\n=== The fate of the civilians ===\nDuring the fighting in Manchuria, Russian troops [[Looting|looted]] and burned some Chinese villages, raped women and often killed those who resisted or did not understand what they wanted.<ref name=Jukes2002_84>{{harvnb|Jukes|2002|p=84}}.</ref> The Russian justification for all this was that Chinese civilians, being Asian, must have been helping their fellow Asians (the Japanese) inflict defeat on the Russians, and therefore deserved to be punished. The Russian troops were gripped by the fear of the \"[[Yellow Peril]]\", and saw all Asians, not just the Japanese, as the enemy.{{r|Jukes2002_84}} All of the Russian soldiers were much feared by the Chinese population of Manchuria, but it was the Cossacks whom they feared the most on the account of their brutality and insatiable desire to loot. Largely because of the more disciplined behavior of the Japanese, the Han and Manchu population of Manchuria tended to be pro-Japanese.{{r|Jukes2002_84}} However Japanese were also prone to looting, albeit in a considerably less brutal manner than the Russians, and summarily executed any Chinese or Manchu whom they suspected of being spies. The city of Liaoyang had the misfortune to be sacked three times within three days: first by the Russians, then by the Chinese police, and finally by the Japanese.{{r|Jukes2002_84}} The Japanese hired Chinese bandits known variously as the Chunguses, Chunchuse or ''khunhuzy'' to engage in guerrilla warfare by attacking Russian supply columns.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|pp=84\u20135}} Only once did the Chunguses attack Japanese forces, and that attack was apparently motivated by the Chunguses mistaking the Japanese forces for a Russian one.<ref name=Jukes2002_85>{{harvnb|Jukes|2002|p=85}}.</ref> [[Zhang Zuolin]], a prominent bandit leader and the future \"Old Marshal\" who would rule Manchuria as a warlord between 1916 and 1928, worked as a Chunguse for the Japanese. Manchuria was still officially part of the Chinese Empire, and the Chinese civil servants tried their best to be neutral as Russian and Japanese troops marched across Manchuria. In the parts of Manchuria occupied by the Japanese, Tokyo appointed \"civil governors\" who worked to improve health, sanitation and the state of the roads.{{r|Jukes2002_85}} These activities were also self-interested, as improved roads lessened Japanese logistics problems while improved health amongst the Chinese lessened the dangers of diseases infecting the Japanese troops. By contrast, the Russians made no effort to improve sanitation or health amongst the Chinese, and destroyed everything when they retreated. Many Chinese tended to see the Japanese as the lesser evil.{{r|Jukes2002_85}}\n\n== Campaign of 1905 ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}<!--Summary portions also need citations per [[WP:Summary style]].-->\n[[File:Retreat of the Russian Army after the Battle of Mukden.jpg|thumb|Retreat of Russian soldiers after the [[Battle of Mukden]]]]\n\nWith the fall of [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]], the Japanese 3rd Army could continue northward to reinforce positions south of Russian-held [[Mukden]].

In the following days Japanese forces proceeded to assault the right and left flanks of Russian forces surrounding Mukden, along a {{convert|50|mi|km|-1|adj=on}} front. Approximately half a million men were involved in the fighting. Both sides were well entrenched and were backed by hundreds of artillery pieces. After days of harsh fighting, added pressure from the flanks forced both ends of the Russian defensive line to curve backwards. Seeing they were about to be encircled, the Russians began a general retreat, fighting a series of fierce rearguard actions, which soon deteriorated in the confusion and collapse of Russian forces. On 10 March 1905, after three weeks of fighting, [[General Kuropatkin]] decided to withdraw to the north of Mukden. The Russians suffered 90,000 casualties in the battle.\n\nThe retreating Russian Manchurian Army formations disbanded as fighting units, but the Japanese failed to destroy them completely. The Japanese themselves had suffered heavy casualties and were in no condition to pursue. Although the Battle of Mukden was a major defeat for the Russians and was the most decisive land battle ever fought by the Japanese, the final victory still depended on the navy.\n\n=== Battle of Tsushima ===\n{{Main|Battle of Tsushima}}\n[[File:JBMikasa.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese battleship Mikasa|Japanese battleship ''Mikasa'']], the flagship of Admiral [[T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d]] at the [[Battle of Tsushima]]]]\n\nAfter a stopover of several weeks at the minor port of [[Nossi-B\u00e9]], [[Madagascar]], that had been reluctantly allowed by neutral France in order not to jeopardize its relations with its Russian ally, the Russian Baltic fleet proceeded to [[Cam Ranh Bay]] in [[French Indochina]] passing on its way through the [[Singapore Strait]] between 7 and 10 April 1905.<ref>{{cite news |date=6 April 1905 |title=The Forlorn Hope of the Armada.

There were three routes to Vladivostok, with the shortest and most direct passing through [[Tsushima Strait]] between Korea and Japan. However, this was also the most dangerous route as it passed between the Japanese home islands and the Japanese naval bases in Korea.\n\nAdmiral T\u014dg\u014d was aware of Russian progress and understood that, with the fall of Port Arthur, the Second and Third Pacific squadrons would try to reach the only other Russian port in the Far East, Vladivostok.

Russia's defeat was met with shock in the West and across the Far East. Japan's prestige rose greatly as it came to be seen as a modern nation. Concurrently, Russia lost virtually its entire Pacific and Baltic fleets, and also much international esteem. This was particularly true in the eyes of Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] before World War I. Russia was France's and [[Serbia]]'s ally, and that loss of prestige had a significant effect on Germany's future when planning for war with France, and in supporting Austria-Hungary's war with Serbia.\n\nIn the absence of Russian competition, and with the distraction of European nations during World War I, combined with the [[Great Depression]] that followed, the Japanese military began efforts to dominate China and the rest of Asia, which eventually led to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Pacific War]] theatres of World War II.\n\n==== Effects on Russia ====\nThough there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces.

Many of the technological innovations brought on by the Industrial Revolution first became present on the battlefield in the Russo-Japanese War. Weapons and armaments were more technological than ever before. Technological developments of modern armaments, such as rapid-firing artillery and machine guns, as well as more accurate rifles, were first used on a mass scale in the Russo-Japanese War. The improved capability of naval forces was also demonstrated. Military operations on both sea and land demonstrated that warfare in a new age of technology had undergone a considerable change since the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u201371.{{r|Steinberg2008_7}}\nMost army commanders had previously envisioned using these weapon systems to dominate the battlefield on an operational and tactical level but, as events played out, these technological advancements forever altered the capacity in which mankind would wage war.{{sfn|Schimmelpenninck van der Oye|2005|p=84}}\nFor East Asia it was the first confrontation after thirty years involving two modern armed forces.\n\nThe advanced weaponry led to massive casualty counts. Neither Japan nor Russia had prepared for the number of deaths that would occur in this new kind of warfare, or had the resources to compensate for these losses. This also left its impression on society at large, with the emergence of transnational and [[nongovernmental organization]]s, like the [[Red Cross]], becoming prominent after the war. The emergence of such organizations can be regarded as the beginning of a meshing together of civilizations through the identification of common problems and challenges, a slow process dominating much of the 20th century.{{sfn|Steinberg|2008|p=6}}\n\nDebate with respect to the Russo-Japanese War preluding World War II is a topic of interest to scholars today. Arguments that are favorable toward this perspective consider characteristics specific to the Russo-Japanese War to the qualities definitive of \"[[total war]]\".{{sfn|Steinberg|2008|p=3}} Numerous aspects of total war characterize the Russo-Japanese War. Encompassed on both ends was the mass mobilization of troops into battle. For both Russia and Japan, the war required extensive economic support in the form of production of equipment, armaments, and supplies at such a scale that both domestic support and foreign aid were required.{{r|Steinberg2008_7}} The conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War also demonstrated the need for world leaders to regard domestic response to foreign policy, which is argued by some scholars as setting in motion the dissolution of the Romanov dynasty by demonstrating the inefficiencies of tsarist Russia's government.{{r|Steinberg2008_7}}\n\n=== Reception around the world ===\n[[File:\uc77c\ubcf8\uacfc \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544\uc5d0 \uc555\uc0ac\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d.png|thumb|Postcard of political satire during the Russo-Japanese War]]\nTo the Western powers, Japan's victory demonstrated the emergence of a new Asian regional power.

And it's in this that the real meaning of the current war resides for social-democracy, even if we set aside its immediate effect: the collapse of Russian absolutism.

The cost of military re-equipment and re-expansion after 1905 pushed the economy further into deficit, although the size of the deficit was obscured.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|p=844}}\n\nThe Japanese were on the offensive for most of the war and used massed infantry assaults against defensive positions, which would later become the standard of all European armies during World War I. The battles of the Russo-Japanese War, in which machine guns and artillery took a heavy toll on Russian and Japanese troops, were a precursor to the [[trench warfare]] of World War I.{{sfn|Keegan|1999|pp=179, 229, 230}} A German military advisor sent to Japan, [[Jakob Meckel]], had a tremendous impact on the development of the Japanese military training, tactics, strategy, and organization. His reforms were credited with Japan's overwhelming victory over China in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894\u20131895. However, his over-reliance on infantry in [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] campaigns also led to a large number of Japanese casualties.\n\n[[File:Dadao map 1939.svg|thumb|280px|[[Japanese Empire]]'s territorial expansion]]\nMilitary and economic exhaustion affected both countries. Japanese historians regard this war as a turning point for Japan, and a key to understanding the reasons why Japan may have failed militarily and politically later. After the war, acrimony was felt at every level of Japanese society and it became the consensus within Japan that their nation had been treated as the defeated power during the peace conference.{{r|NYT3Sep1905}} As time went on, this feeling, coupled with the sense of \"arrogance\" at becoming a [[Great Power]], grew and added to growing Japanese hostility towards the West, and fueled Japan's military and imperial ambitions. Furthermore, Japan's substantiated interests in Korea and Liaodong led to the creation of a [[Kwantung Army]], which became an autonomous and increasingly powerful regional force. Only five years after the war, Japan ''de jure'' annexed Korea as part of its colonial empire. Two decades after that, the Kwantung Army staged an incident that led to the invasion of Manchuria in the [[Mukden Incident]]; the Kwantung Army eventually came to be heavily involved in the state's politics and administration, leading to a series of localized conflicts with Chinese regional warlords that finally extended into the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937. As a result, most Chinese historians consider the Russo-Japanese War as a key development in Japan's spiral into [[Japanese militarism|militarism]] in the 1920s\u201330s.\n\nFollowing the victory of the [[Battle of Tsushima]], Japan's erstwhile British ally presented a lock of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson's]] hair to the Imperial Japanese Navy, judging its performance then as on a par with Britain's victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] in 1805. It is still on display at Kyouiku Sankoukan, a public museum maintained by the Japan Self-Defense Force. Nevertheless, there was a consequent change in British strategic thinking, resulting in enlargement of its naval docks at [[Auckland]], New Zealand; [[Bombay]], [[British Raj|British India]]; [[Fremantle]] and Sydney, Australia; [[Simon's Town]], [[Cape Colony]]; Singapore and [[British Hong Kong]]. The naval war confirmed the direction of the [[British Admiralty]]'s thinking in tactical terms even as it undermined its strategic grasp of a changing world. Tactical orthodoxy, for example, assumed that a naval battle would imitate the conditions of stationary combat and that ships would engage in one long line sailing on parallel courses; but more flexible tactical thinking would now be required as a firing ship and its target maneuvered independently.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|p=384, 386, 388}}\n\n== Military attach\u00e9s and observers ==\n{{Main|Military attach\u00e9s and observers in the Russo-Japanese War}}\n[[File:General Kuroki and his Staffs, Foreign Officiers and Correspondents.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Japanese general, Kuroki, and his staff, including foreign officers and war correspondents after the [[Battle of Shaho]] (1904)]]\n\nMilitary and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. Most were able to report on events from the perspective of [[embedded journalist|embedded]] positions within the land and naval forces of both Russia and Japan. These military attach\u00e9s and other observers prepared first-hand accounts of the war and analytical papers. In-depth observer narratives of the war and more narrowly focused professional journal articles were written soon after the war; and these post-war reports conclusively illustrated the battlefield destructiveness of this conflict. This was the first time the tactics of entrenched positions for infantry defended with machine guns and artillery became vitally important. Both would become dominant factors in World War I.\nEven though entrenched positions had already been a significant part of both the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[American Civil War]], it is now apparent that the high casualty counts, and the tactical lessons readily available to observer nations, were completely disregarded in preparations for war in Europe, and during much of the course of World War I.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Sisemore |first=James D. |year=1991 |title=The Russo-Japanese War, Lessons Not Learned |location=Fort Leavenworth, KS |publisher=[[U.S. Army Command and General Staff College]] |p=iii |url=http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p4013coll2&CISOPTR=113 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1904\u20131905, [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton]] was the military attach\u00e9 of the [[British Indian Army]] serving with the Imperial Japanese Army in Manchuria.

Around 300 were made before their creation was banned by the Russian government. Their Japanese equivalents were [[Ukiyo-e|woodblock prints]]. These had been common during the Sino-Japanese war a decade earlier and celebrations of the new conflict tended to repeat the same imagery and situations. But by this time in Japan postcards had become the most common form of communication and they soon replaced prints as a medium for topographical imagery and war reportage. In some ways, however, they were still dependent on the print for their pictorial conventions, not least in issuing the cards in series that assembled into a composite scene or design, either as [[diptychs]], [[triptych]]s or even more ambitious formats. However, captioning swiftly moved from the calligraphic side inscription to a printed title below, and not just in Japanese but in English and other European languages. There was a lively sense that these images served not only as mementoes but also as propaganda statements.{{r|Dower2008}}\n\nWar artists were to be found on the Russian side and even figured among the casualties.

There is great admiration for the Japanese, who were British allies. Russia is in turmoil, but the main impetus towards war is not imperialism as such but commercial forces. \"Every student of modern history has remarked the fact that all recent wars have been promoted by great combinations of capitalists. The causes which formerly led to war between nation and nation have ceased to operate\" (p.&nbsp;40). The true villain plotting in the background, however, is the German Emperor, seeking to destabilise the European balance of power in his country's favour. Towards the end of the novel, the narrator steals a German submarine and successfully foils a plot to involve the British in the war. The submarine motif reappeared in [[George Griffith]]'s science fiction novel, ''The Stolen Submarine'' (1904), although in this case it is a French super-submarine which its developer sells to the Russians for use against the Japanese in another tale of international intrigue.<ref>E.F. and R.

W. W. Walker's Canadian novella, ''Alter Ego'', is an exception. It features a Canadian volunteer in the Russian army who, on his return, agrees to talk about his experiences to an isolated upcountry community and relates his part in the Battle of Mukden.<ref>{{cite book |author=Walker, W.W. |year=1907 |title=Alter Ego: a Tale |location=Toronto |publisher=William Briggs |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37731 }}</ref> Though this incident only occupies two of the book's six chapters, it is used to illustrate the main message there, that war is \"anti-Christian and barbarous, except in a defensive sense\" (Ch.3).\n\n[[File:MIKASAPAINTING.jpg|thumb|Painting of Admiral [[Heihachir\u014d T\u014dg\u014d]] on the bridge of the [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|Japanese battleship ''Mikasa'']], before the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905]]\nVarious aspects of the war were also common in contemporary children's fiction. Categorised as [[Boys' Own]] adventure stories, they offer few insights into the conflict, being generally based on news articles and sharing unreflectingly in the contemporary culture of imperialism.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Russo-Japanese War and Boys Own Adventure Stories |website=The Russo-Japanese War Research Society |url=http://russojapanesewar.com/boys-own.html |access-date=16 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023400/http://russojapanesewar.com/boys-own.html |archive-date=21 June 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Among these, [[Herbert Strang]] was responsible for two novels: ''Kobo'' told from the Japanese side,<ref>{{cite book |last=Strang |first=Herbert |year=1905 |title=Kobo |publisher=G.P.

Two other English-language stories begin with the action at Port Arthur and follow the events thereafter: ''A Soldier of Japan: a tale of the Russo-Japanese War'' by Captain [[Frederick Sadleir Brereton]], and ''The North Pacific''<ref>{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Willis B. |year=1905 |title=The North Pacific \u2013 A Story of the Russo-Japanese War |location=New York City |publisher=E.P.

Two more also involve young men fighting in the Japanese navy: Americans in ''For the Mikado''<ref>{{cite book |last=Munroe |first=Kirk |year=1905 |title=For the Mikado or a Japanese Middy in Action |publisher=Harper & brothers |url=https://archive.org/details/formikadoorajap00munrgoog }}</ref> by [[Kirk Munroe]], and a temporarily disgraced English officer in ''Under the Ensign of the Rising Sun''<ref>{{cite book |last=Collingwood |first=Harry |year=1916 |title=Under the Ensign of the Rising Sun \u2013 A Story of the Russo-Japanese War |location=New York City |publisher=Silver Scroll |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27910 }}</ref> by Harry Collingwood, the pen-name of William Joseph Cosens Lancaster (1851\u20131922), whose speciality was [[nautical fiction|naval fiction]].\n\nAnother literary genre affected by the outcome of the war was [[invasion literature]], either fuelled by racialist fears or generated by the international power struggle. [[Shunr\u014d Oshikawa]]'s novel ''The Submarine Battleship'' (''Kaitei Gunkan'') was published in 1900 before the actual fighting began but shared the imperial tensions that produced it. It is the story of an armoured ram-armed submarine involved in a Russo-Japanese conflict.<ref>Derek Linney, ''Invasion-Literature, 1871\u20131914'', [http://www.theriddleofthesands.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Invasion-Literature-1871-1914-1.pdf p.95]</ref> Three other novels appeared in 1908 and are thought of as significant now because of their prophetic dimension. American author Arthur Wellesley Kipling (1885\u20131947) prefaced his ''The New Dominion \u2013 A Tale of Tomorrow's Wars'' with a note counselling future vigilance. The scenario there is an attack by German and Japanese allies which the US and British navies victoriously fend off.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/newdominionatal00kiplgoog Archived online]</ref> In Germany itself an air attack on the American fleet is described by Ferdinand Heinrich Grautoff (1871\u20131935), writing under the name Parabellum, in his novel ''Banzai!''. Published in Berlin in 1908, it was translated into English the following year.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19498/19498-h/19498-h.htm Gutenberg]</ref> An Australian author using the pseudonym Charles H. Kirmess first serialised his ''The Commonwealth Crisis'' and then revised it for book publication as ''The Australian Crisis'' in 1909. It is set in 1912 and told from the standpoint of 1922, following a military invasion of Australia's Northern Territory and colonisation by Japanese settlers.<ref>[http://www.australianculture.org/the-australian-crisis Text online]</ref>\n\nMost Russian fictional accounts of the war had a documentary element. [[Alexey Novikov-Priboy]] had served in the Baltic Fleet and wrote about the conflict on his return, but his early work was suppressed. It was not until the changed political climate under Soviet rule that he began writing his historical epic ''Tsushima'', based on his own experiences on board the battleship ''Orel'' as well as on testimonies of fellow sailors and government archives. The first part was published in 1932, the second in 1935, and the whole novel was later awarded the [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]]. It describes the heroism of Russian sailors and certain officers whose defeat, in accordance with the new Soviet thinking, was due to the criminal negligence of the Imperial Naval command. A German novel by [[Frank Thiess]], originally published as ''Tsushima'' in 1936 (and later translated as ''The Voyage of Forgotten Men''), covered the same journey round the world to defeat.\n\nLater there appeared a first-hand account of the siege of Port Arthur by Alexander Stepanov (1892\u20131965). He had been present there as the 12-year-old son of a battery commander and his novel, ''Port Arthur: a historical narrative'' (1944), is based on his own diaries and his father's notes. The work is considered one of the best historical novels of the Soviet period.<ref>{{cite book |author=Aleksandr N Stepanov |year=1947 |translator=J. Fineberg |title=Port Arthur: a historical narrative |publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3QMDAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> A later novel in which the war appears is [[Valentin Pikul]]'s ''The Three Ages of Okini-San'' (1981). Centred on the life of Vladimir Kokovtsov, who rose through the ranks to admiral of the Russian fleet, it covers the period from the Russo-Japanese War through to the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s. A much later Russian genre novel uses the period of the war as background. This is [[Boris Akunin]]'s ''[[The Diamond Chariot]]'' (2003), in the first part of which the detective [[Erast Fandorin]] is charged with protecting the Trans-Siberian Railway from Japanese sabotage.\n\nThe main historical novel dealing with the war from the Japanese side is [[Shiba Ry\u014dtar\u014d]]'s ''[[Saka no Ue no Kumo|Clouds Above the Hill]]'', published serially in several volumes between 1968 and 1972, and translated in English in 2013. The closely researched story spans the decade from the Sino-Japanese War to the Russo-Japanese War and went on to become the nation's favourite book.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hiroaki Sato |title=Multiple perspectives in novel on the Russo-Japanese War |newspaper=The Japan Times |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/07/27/books/book-reviews/multiple-perspectives-in-novel-on-the-russo-japanese-war/#.VWzWUVJS8SV |accessdate=27 July 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n{{See also|List of war films and TV specials#Russo-Japanese War .281904.E2.80.931905.29|l1=Film list about the Russo-Japanese War}}\n* [[Port Arthur (film)|''Port Arthur'']] (1936)\n* ''[[Cruiser 'Varyag'|Kreiser Varyag]]'' (1946)<ref>''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3or0DRS_uc Kreiser Varyag'' on YouTube, Russian language only]</ref> \n* ''[[Nichiro sens\u014d sh\u014dri no hishi: Tekich\u016b \u014ddan sanbyaku-ri]]'' (1957)\n* ''[[Meiji tenn\u00f4 to nichiro daisenso]]'' (1958)\n* ''[[The Battle of the Japan Sea]]'' (1969, {{lang|ja|\u4f50\u85e4 \u52dd: \u65e5\u672c\u6d77\u5927\u6d77\u6226}}, ''Nihonkai-Daikaisen'') depicts the naval battles of the war, the attacks on the Port Arthur highlands, and the subterfuge and diplomacy of Japanese agents in Sweden.

[[Vladivostok]] was operational only during the summer, whereas [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]], a naval base in Liaodong Province leased to Russia by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, was operational all year. Since the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, Japan feared Russian encroachment on its plans to create a [[sphere of influence]] in Korea and Manchuria. Russia had demonstrated an expansionist policy in the [[Siberia]]n [[Russian Far East|Far East]] from the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]] in the 16th century.{{sfn|Steinberg|2008|p=2}}\n\nSeeing Russia as a rival, Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in [[Manchuria]] in exchange for recognition of Korea as being within the Japanese sphere of influence. Russia refused and demanded Korea north of the [[39th parallel north|39th parallel]] to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan. The Japanese government perceived a Russian threat to their plans for expansion into [[Asia]] and chose to go to war. After negotiations broke down in 1904, the Japanese Navy opened hostilities by attacking the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur, China, in a surprise attack.\n\nRussia suffered multiple defeats by Japan, but [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] was convinced that Russia would win and chose to remain engaged in the war; at first, to await the outcomes of certain naval battles, and later to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a \"humiliating peace\". Russia ignored Japan's willingness early on to agree to an armistice and rejected the idea to bring the dispute to the Arbitration Court at The Hague. The war concluded with the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], mediated by US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. The complete victory of the Japanese military surprised world observers. The consequences transformed the balance of power in [[East Asia]], resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. It was the first major military victory in the modern era of an Asian power over a [[Europe]]an one. Scholars continue to debate the historical significance of the war.\n\n== Historical background ==\n\n=== Modernization of Japan ===\n[[File:Kisabur\u014d Ohara, Europe and Asia Octopus Map, 1904 Cornell CUL PJM 1145 01.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.2|An anti-Russian satirical map produced by a Japanese student at [[Keio University]] during the Russo-Japanese War. It follows the design used for a similar map first published in 1877.<ref>\"[[c:File:Serio-comic war map for 1877.jpg|Serio-comic war map for the year 1877]]\" by Frederick W. Rose (publisher not identified).</ref>]]\n\nAfter the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, the Meiji government endeavored to assimilate [[Western world|Western]] ideas, technological advances and ways of warfare. By the late 19th century, Japan had transformed itself into a modernized industrial state. The Japanese wanted to be recognized as equal with the Western powers. The Meiji Restoration had been intended to make Japan a modernized state, not a Westernized one, and Japan was an imperialist power, looking towards overseas expansionism.{{sfn|Storry|1979|pp=15\u20136}}\n\nIn the years 1869\u201373, the ''[[Seikanron]]'' (\"Conquer Korea Argument\") had bitterly divided the Japanese elite between one faction that wanted to conquer Korea immediately vs. another that wanted to wait until Japan was more modernized before embarking on a war to conquer Korea; significantly no one in the Japanese elite ever accepted the idea that the Koreans had the right to be independent, with only the question of timing dividing the two factions.{{sfn|Storry|1979|p=16}} In much the same way that Europeans used the \"backwardness\" of African and Asian nations as a reason for why they had to conquer them, for the Japanese elite the \"backwardness\" of China and Korea was proof of the inferiority of those nations, thus giving the Japanese the \"right\" to conquer them.<ref name=\"Storry1979_17\">{{harvnb|Storry|1979|p=17}}.</ref>\n\n[[Inoue Kaoru|Inouye Kaoru]], the Foreign Minister, gave a speech in 1887 saying \"What we must do is to transform our empire and our people, make the empire like the countries of Europe and our people like the peoples of Europe,\" going on to say that the Chinese and Koreans had essentially forfeited their right to be independent by not modernizing.{{r|Storry1979_17}} Much of the pressure for an aggressive foreign policy in Japan came from below, with the advocates of [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement|\"people's rights\" movement]] calling for an elected parliament also favoring an ultra-nationalist line that took it for granted the Japanese had the \"right\" to annex Korea, as the \"people's right\" movement was led by those who favored invading Korea in the years 1869\u201373.{{r|Storry1979_17}}\n\nAs part of the modernization process in Japan, [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinist]] ideas about the \"[[survival of the fittest]]\" were common in Japan from the 1880s onward and many ordinary Japanese resented the heavy taxes imposed by the government to modernize Japan, demanding something tangible like an overseas [[colony]] as a reward for their sacrifices.{{sfn|Storry|1979|pp=18\u20139}}\n\nFurthermore, the educational system of Meiji Japan was meant to train the schoolboys to be soldiers when they grew up, and as such, Japanese schools indoctrinated their students into ''[[Bushido|Bushid\u014d]]'' (\"the spirit of the warriors\"), the fierce code of the samurai.{{r|Storry1979_17}} Having indoctrinated the younger generations into ''Bushid\u014d'', the Meiji elite found themselves faced with a people who clamored for war, and regarded diplomacy as a weakness.{{r|Storry1979_17}}\n\n=== Pressure from the people ===\nThe British Japanologist Richard Storry wrote that the biggest misconception about Japan in the West was that the Japanese people were the \"docile\" instruments of the elite, when in fact much of the pressure for Japan's wars from 1894 to 1941 came from the ordinary people, who demanded a \"tough\" foreign policy, and tended to engage in riots and assassination when foreign policy was perceived to be pusillanimous.{{r|Storry1979_17}}\n\nThough the Meiji [[oligarchy]] refused to allow [[democracy]], they did seek to appropriate some of the demands of the \"people's rights\" movement by allowing an elected Diet in 1890 (with limited powers and an equally limited franchise) and by pursuing an aggressive foreign policy towards Korea.{{r|Storry1979_17}}\n\nIn 1884, Japan had encouraged a coup in Korea by a pro-Japanese reformist faction, which led to the conservative government calling upon China for help, leading to a clash between Chinese and Japanese soldiers in Seoul.<ref name=\"Storry1979_20\">{{harvnb|Storry|1979|p=20}}.</ref> At the time, Tokyo did not feel ready to risk a war with China, and the crisis was ended by the [[Convention of Tientsin]], which left Korea more strongly in the Chinese sphere of influence, though it did give the Japanese the right to intervene in Korea.{{r|Storry1979_20}} All through the 1880s and early 1890s, the government in Tokyo was regularly criticized for not being aggressive enough in Korea, leading Japanese historian [[Masao Maruyama (scholar)|Masao Maruyama]] to write: <blockquote>Just as Japan was subject to pressure from the Great Powers, so she would apply pressure to still weaker countries\u2014a clear case of the transfer psychology. In this regard it is significant that ever since the Meiji period demands for a tough foreign policy have come from the common people, that is, from those who are at the receiving end of oppression at home.{{r|Storry1979_20}}</blockquote>\n\n=== Russian Eastern expansion ===\nTsarist Russia, as a major imperial power, had ambitions in the East. By the 1890s it had extended its realm across [[Central Asia]] to [[Afghanistan]], absorbing local states in the process. The [[Russian Empire]] stretched from Poland in the west to the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in the east.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Growth of European and Japanese Dominions in Asia since 1801 |others=Map by Velhagen & Klasings |website=University of Texas \u2013 Perry\u2013Casta\u00f1eda Library Map Collection |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/shepherd/japan_euro_growth_1800.jpg }}</ref> With its construction of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to the port of [[Vladivostok]], Russia hoped to further consolidate its influence and presence in the region. In the [[Tsushima incident]] of 1861 Russia had directly assaulted Japanese territory.\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395) ===\n{{Main|First Sino-Japanese War}}\n[[File:Generals Pyongyang MigitaToshihide October1894.jpg|thumb|Chinese generals in [[Pyongyang]] surrender to the Japanese, October 1894.]]\n\nBetween the Meiji Restoration and its participation in [[World War I]], the Empire of Japan fought in two significant wars. The first war Japan fought was the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], fought in 1894 and 1895. The war revolved around the issue of control and influence over Korea under the rule of the [[Joseon]] dynasty. From the 1880s onward, there had been vigorous competition for influence in Korea between China and Japan.<ref name=Hwang2010_1323>{{harvnb|Hwang|2010|pp=132\u20133}}.</ref> The Korean court was prone to factionalism, and was badly divided by a reformist faction that was pro-Japanese and a more conservative faction that was pro-Chinese.{{r|Hwang2010_1323}} In 1884, a pro-Japanese coup attempt was put down by Chinese troops, and a \"residency\" under General Yuan Shikai was established in Seoul.{{r|Hwang2010_1323}} A peasant rebellion led by the [[Donghak|Tonghak]] religious movement led to a request by the Korean government for the [[Qing dynasty]] to send in troops to stabilize the country.{{r|Hwang2010_1323}} The Empire of Japan responded by sending their own force to Korea to crush the Tonghak and installed a puppet government in [[Seoul]]. China objected and war ensued. Hostilities proved brief, with Japanese ground troops routing Chinese forces on the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and nearly destroying the Chinese [[Beiyang Fleet]] in the [[Battle of the Yalu River (1894)|Battle of the Yalu River]]. Japan and China signed the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], which ceded the Liaodong Peninsula and the island of Taiwan to Japan. After the peace treaty, Russia, Germany, and France [[Triple Intervention|forced Japan to withdraw from the Liaodong Peninsula]]. The leaders of Japan did not feel that they possessed the strength to resist the combined might of Russia, Germany and France, and so gave in to the ultimatum. At the same time, the Japanese did not abandon their attempts to force Korea into the Japanese sphere of influence. On 8 October 1895, [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]] of Korea, the leader of the anti-Japanese and pro-Chinese faction at the Korean court was murdered by Japanese agents within the halls of the [[Gyeongbokgung]] palace, an act that backfired badly as it turned Korean public opinion against Japan.<ref name=Hwang2010_137>{{harvnb|Hwang|2010|p=137}}.</ref> In early 1896, King [[Gojong of Korea]] [[Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation|fled to the Russian legation]] in Seoul under the grounds that his life was in danger from Japanese agents, and Russian influence in Korea started to predominate.{{r|Hwang2010_137}} In the aftermath of the flight of the king, a popular uprising overthrew the pro-Japanese government and several cabinet ministers were lynched on the streets.{{r|Hwang2010_137}}\n\nIn 1897, Russia occupied the Liaodong Peninsula, built the [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]] fortress, and based the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Russian Pacific Fleet]] in the port. Russia's acquisition of Port Arthur was primarily an anti-British move to counter the British occupation of [[Weihai|Wei-hai-Wei]], but in Japan, this was perceived as an anti-Japanese move.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|p=8}} Germany occupied [[Jiaozhou Bay]], built the [[Siege of Tsingtao|Tsingtao fortress]], and based the [[German East Asia Squadron]] in this port. Between 1897 and 1903, the Russians built the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] (CER) in Manchuria.<ref name=Jukes2002_9>{{harvnb|Jukes|2002|p=9}}.</ref> The Chinese Eastern Railroad was owned jointly by the Russian and Chinese governments, but the company's management was entirely Russian, the line was built to the Russian gauge and Russian troops were stationed in Manchuria to protect rail traffic on the CER from bandit attacks.{{r|Jukes2002_9}} The headquarters of the CER company was located in the new Russian-built city of [[Harbin]], the \"Moscow of the Orient\". From 1897 onwards, Manchuria\u2014while still nominally part of the \"Great Qing Empire\"\u2014started to resemble more and more a Russian province.{{r|Jukes2002_9}}\n\n=== Russian encroachment ===\nIn December 1897, a [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian]] fleet appeared off Port Arthur. After three months, in 1898, China and Russia negotiated a convention by which China leased (to Russia) Port Arthur, [[Talienwan]] and the surrounding waters. The two parties further agreed that the convention could be extended by mutual agreement. The Russians clearly expected such an extension, for they lost no time in occupying the territory and in fortifying Port Arthur, their sole warm-water port on the Pacific coast and of great strategic value. A year later, to consolidate their position, the Russians began to build a new railway from [[Harbin]] through [[Mukden]] to Port Arthur, the South Manchurian Railroad.{{r|Jukes2002_9}} The development of the railway became a contributory factor to the [[Boxer Rebellion]], when [[Boxers attacks on Chinese Eastern Railway|Boxer forces burned the railway stations]].{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|p=19\u201320}}\n\nThe Russians also began to make inroads into Korea. By 1898 they had acquired mining and forestry concessions near the Yalu and Tumen rivers,{{sfn|Paine|2003|p=317}} causing the Japanese much anxiety. Japan decided to attack before the Russians completed the Trans-Siberian Railway.\n\n=== Boxer Rebellion ===\n{{Main|Boxer Rebellion}}\n{{See also|Russian invasion of Manchuria}}\n[[File:Troops of the Eight nations alliance 1900.jpg|thumb|Troops of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] in 1900. Left to right: Britain, United States, Australia, India, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Japan.]]\n\nThe Russians and the Japanese both contributed troops to the [[Eight-Nation Alliance|eight-member international force]] sent in 1900 to quell the Boxer Rebellion and to relieve the international legations under siege in the Chinese capital, Beijing. Russia had already sent 177,000 soldiers to [[Manchuria]], nominally to protect its railways under construction. The troops of the Qing Empire and the participants of the Boxer Rebellion could do nothing against such a massive army and [[Russian invasion of Manchuria|were ejected from Manchuria]]. After the Boxer Rebellion, 100,000 Russian soldiers were stationed in Manchuria.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|p=11}} The Russian troops settled in{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|p=7\u20138}} and despite assurances they would vacate the area after the crisis, by 1903 the Russians had not established a timetable for withdrawal{{sfn|Paine|2003|p=320}} and had actually strengthened their position in Manchuria.\n\n=== Pre-war negotiations ===\nThe Japanese statesman [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] started to negotiate with the Russians. He regarded Japan as too weak to evict the Russians militarily, so he proposed giving Russia control over Manchuria in exchange for Japanese control of northern Korea. Of the five ''Genr\u014d'' (elder statesmen) who made up the Meiji oligarchy, It\u014d Hirobumi and Count [[Inoue Kaoru]] were opposed to war against Russia on financial grounds while [[Katsura Tar\u014d]], [[Komura Jutar\u014d]] and Field Marshal [[Yamagata Aritomo]] favored war.{{sfn|Kat\u014d|2007|p=96}} Meanwhile, Japan and [[British Empire|Britain]] had signed the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] in 1902, the British seeking to restrict naval competition by keeping the Russian Pacific seaports of Vladivostok and Port Arthur from their full use. The alliance with the British meant, in part, that if any nation allied itself with Russia during any war against Japan, then Britain would enter the war on Japan's side. Russia could no longer count on receiving help from either Germany or France without there being a danger of British involvement in the war. With such an alliance, Japan felt free to commence hostilities, if necessary.\n\nThe 1890s and 1900s marked the height of the \"[[Yellow Peril]]\" propaganda by the German government and the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] often wrote letters to his cousin Nicholas II of Russia, praising him as the \"savior of the white race\" and urging Russia forward in Asia.<ref name=McLean2003_121>{{harvnb|McLean|2003|p=121}}.</ref><ref name=Fiebi-vonHase2003_165>{{harvnb|Fiebi-von Hase|2003|p=165}}.</ref> From November 1894 onward, Wilhelm had been writing letters praising Nicholas as Europe's defender from the \"Yellow Peril\", assuring the Tsar that God Himself had \"chosen\" Russia to defend Europe from the alleged Asian threat.{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=182}} On 1 November 1902, Wilhelm wrote to Nicholas that \"certain symptoms in the East seem to show that Japan is becoming a rather restless customer\" and \"it is evident to every unbiased mind that Korea must and will be Russian\".{{r|McLean2003_121}} Wilhelm ended his letter with the warning that Japan and China would soon unite against Europe, writing: \"Twenty to thirty million Chinese, supported by a half dozen Japanese divisions, led by competent, intrepid Japanese officers, full of hatred for Christianity\u2014that is a vision of the future that cannot be contemplated without concern, and it is not impossible. On the contrary, it is the realisation of the yellow peril, which I described a few years ago and I was ridiculed by the majority of people for my graphic depiction of it&nbsp;... Your devoted friend and cousin, Willy, Admiral of the Atlantic\".{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=183}}\n\nWilhelm aggressively encouraged Russia's ambitions in Asia as France, Russia's ally since 1894, was less than supportive of Russian expansionism in Asia, and it was believed in Berlin that German support of Russia might break up the Franco-Russian alliance and lead to a new German\u2013Russian alliance.{{r|McLean2003_121}}\nThe French, who had been Russia's closest allies since 1894, made it clear that they disapproved of Nicholas's forward policy in Asia with the French Premier [[Maurice Rouvier]] publicly declaring that the Franco-Russian alliance applied only to Europe, not Asia, and that France would remain neutral if Japan attacked Russia.{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|pp=252\u20133}} The American president [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who was attempting to mediate the Russian\u2013Japanese dispute, complained that Wilhelm's \"Yellow Peril\" propaganda, which strongly implied that Germany might go to war against Japan in support of Russia, encouraged Russian intransigence.{{sfn|Fiebi-von Hase|2003|p=163}} On 24 July 1905, in a letter to the British diplomat [[Cecil Spring Rice]], Roosevelt wrote that Wilhelm bore partial responsibility for the war as \"he has done all he could to bring it about\", charging that Wilhelm's constant warnings about the \"Yellow Peril\" had made the Russians uninterested in compromise as Nicholas believed that Germany would intervene if Japan attacked.{{sfn|Fiebi-von Hase|2003|p=163-4}}\n\nThe implicit promise of German support suggested by Wilhelm's \"Yellow Peril\" speeches and letters to Nicholas led many decision-makers in St. Petersburg to believe that Russia's military weaknesses in the Far East like the uncompleted Trans-Siberian railroad line did not matter as it was assumed the ''Reich'' would come to Russia's assistance if war should come. In fact, neither Wilhelm nor his Chancellor Prince [[Bernhard von B\u00fclow]] had much interest in East Asia, and Wilhelm's letters to Nicholas praising him as Europe's savior against the \"Yellow Peril\" were really meant to change the [[European balance of power|balance of power in Europe]] as Wilhelm believed that if Russia was embroiled with Japan, this would break up the Franco-Russian alliance and lead to Nicholas signing an alliance with Germany.{{r|Fiebi-vonHase2003_165}} This was especially the case as Germany had embarked upon the Tirpitz plan and a policy of ''[[Weltpolitik]]'' meant to challenge Britain's position as the world's leading power, and since Britain was allied to Japan, then if Russia and Japan could be manipulated into going to war with each other, that this in turn would lead to Russia turning towards Germany.{{r|Fiebi-vonHase2003_165}}\nFurthermore, Wilhelm believed if a Russian\u2013German alliance emerged, France would be compelled to join it and having Russia pursue an expansionist policy in Asia would keep Russia out of the Balkans, thus removing the main source of tension between Russia and Germany's ally Austria-Hungary.{{r|McLean2003_121}} During the war, Nicholas who took at face value Wilhelm's \"Yellow Peril\" speeches, placed much hope in German intervention on his side, and more than once, Nicholas chose to continue the war out of the belief that the Kaiser would come to his aid.{{sfn|McLean|2003|pp=127\u20138}}\n\nBy 8 April 1903, Russia was supposed to have completed its withdrawal of its forces in Manchuria that it had dispatched to crush the Boxer Rebellion, but that day passed with no reductions in Russian forces in Manchuria.{{sfn|Kat\u014d|2007|p=102}} In Japan, university students demonstrated against both Russia and their own government for not taking any action.{{sfn|Kat\u014d|2007|p=102}} On 28 July 1903, [[Shinichiro Kurino|Kurino Shin'ichir\u014d]], the Japanese minister in [[St. Petersburg]], was instructed to present his country's view opposing Russia's consolidation plans in Manchuria. On 3 August, the Japanese minister handed in the following document to serve as the basis for further negotiations:<ref>{{cite book |title=Baron Komura to Mr. Kurino |date=3 August 1903 }} in {{harvnb|Correspondence Regarding Negotiations|1904|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/correspondencere00japarich#page/7/mode/1up 7\u20139]}}.</ref>\n# Mutual engagement to respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Chinese and Korean empires and to maintain the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce and industry of all nations in those countries.\n# Reciprocal recognition of Japan's preponderating interests in Korea and Russia's special interests in railway enterprises in Manchuria, and of the right of Japan to take in Korea and of Russia to take in Manchuria such measures as may be necessary for the protection of their respective interests as above defined, subject, however, to the provisions of article I of this agreement.\n# Reciprocal undertaking on the part of Russia and Japan not to impede development of those industrial and commercial activities respectively of Japan in Korea and of Russia in Manchuria, which are not inconsistent with the stipulations of article I of this agreement.

and Russia, Russia scaled back its demands and claims regarding Korea bit by bit, making a series of concessions that Japan regarded as serious compromises on Russia's part\".<ref

name=Kat\u014d2007_101>{{harvnb|Kat\u014d|2007|p=101}}.</ref> The Korean and Manchurian issues had become linked as the Prime Minister [[Katsura Tar\u014d]] decided if war did come, that Japan was more likely to have the support of the United States and Great Britain if the war could be presented as a struggle for free trade against the highly protectionist Russian empire, in which case, Manchuria, which was the larger market than Korea, was more likely to engage Anglo-American sympathies.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_101}} Throughout the war, a recurring theme of Japanese propaganda was Japan was a \"civilized\" power that supported free trade and would implicitly allow foreign businesses into the resource-rich region of Manchuria vs. Russia the \"uncivilized\" power that was protectionist and wanted to keep the riches of Manchuria all to itself.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_101}}\n\nEmperor Gojong of Korea came to believe that the issue dividing Japan and Russia was Manchuria, and chose to pursue a policy of neutrality as the best way of preserving Korean independence as the crisis mounted.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_978}} Hu Weide, the Chinese minister in St. Petersburg in a series of reports to Beijing looked closely at whether a Russian or a Japanese victory would be favorable to China, and argued that the latter was preferable, as he maintained a Japanese victory presented the better chance for China to regain sovereignty over Manchuria.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_978}} In December 1903, China decided to remain neutral if war came, because though Japan was the only power capable of evicting Russia from Manchuria, the extent of Japanese ambitions in Manchuria was not clear in Beijing.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_978}}\n\nIn the Russian\u2013Japanese negotiations then followed, although by early January 1904, the Japanese government had realised that Russia was not interested in settling the [[Manchuria]]n or Korean issues. Instead, Russia's goal was buying time \u2013 via diplomacy \u2013 to further build up militarily.<ref name=KodaNWCR2005>{{Cite journal |last=Koda |first=Yoji |title=The Russo-Japanese War: Primary Causes of Japanese Success |journal=[[Naval War College Review]]  |volume=58 |issue=2 |date=Spring 2005 |via=Questia Online Library |url-access=subscription |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-840737501 }}</ref> In December 1903, Wilhelm wrote in a marginal note on a diplomatic dispatch about his role in inflaming Russo-Japanese relations:<blockquote>Since 97\u2014Kiaochow\u2014we have never left Russia in any doubt that we would cover her back in Europe, in case she decided to pursue a bigger policy in the Far East that might lead to military complications (with the aim of relieving our eastern border from the fearful pressure and threat of the massive Russian army!). Whereupon, Russia took Port Arthur and ''trusting us'', took her fleet ''out of the Baltic'', thereby making herself ''vulnerable to us'' by sea. In Danzig 01 and Reval 02, the same assurance was given again, with result that entire Russian divisions from Poland and European Russia were and are being sent to the Far East. This would not had happened if our governments had not been in agreement!{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=164}}</blockquote>\nA recurring theme of Wilhelm's letters to Nicholas was that \"Holy Russia\" had been \"chosen\" by God to save the \"entire white race\" from the \"Yellow Peril\", and that Russia was \"entitled\" to annex all of Korea, Manchuria, and northern China up to Beijing.{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=263}} Wilhelm went on to assure Nicholas that once Russia had defeated Japan that this would be a deadly blow to British diplomacy, and the two emperors, the self-proclaimed \"Admiral of the Atlantic\" and the \"Admiral of the Pacific\" would rule Eurasia together, making them able to challenge British sea power as the resources of Eurasia would make their empires immune to a British blockade, which would thus allow Germany and Russia to \"divide up the best\" of the British colonies in Asia between them.{{sfn|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=263}}\n\nNicholas had been prepared to compromise with Japan, but after receiving a letter from Wilhelm attacking him as a coward for his willingness to compromise with the Japanese (whom Wilhelm never ceasing reminding Nicholas represented the \"Yellow Peril\") for the sake of peace, become more obstinate.<ref name=R\u00f6hl2014_269>{{harvnb|R\u00f6hl|2014|p=269}}.</ref> Wilhelm had written to Nicholas stating that the question of Russian interests in Manchuria and Korea was beside the point, saying instead it was a matter of Russia<blockquote>undertaking the protection and defense of the White Race, and with it, Christian civilization, against the Yellow Race. And whatever the Japs are determined to ensure the domination of the Yellow Race in East Asia, to put themselves at its head and organise and lead it into battle against the White Race. That is the kernel of the situation, and therefore there can be very little doubt about where the sympathies of all half-way intelligent Europeans should lie. England betrayed Europe's interests to America in a cowardly and shameful way over the Panama Canal question, so as to be left in 'peace' by the Yankees. Will the 'Tsar' likewise betray the interests of the White Race to the Yellow as to be 'left in peace' and not embarrass the Hague tribunal too much?.{{r|R\u00f6hl2014_269}}</blockquote>\nWhen Nicholas replied that he still wanted peace, Wilhelm wrote back in a telegram \"You innocent angel!\", telling his advisors \"This is the language of an innocent angel. But not that of a White Tsar!\".{{r|R\u00f6hl2014_269}} Nevertheless, the belief in Tokyo was that Russia was not serious about seeking a peaceful solution to the dispute, on 13 January 1904, Japan proposed a formula by which Manchuria would be outside the Japanese sphere of influence and, reciprocally, Korea outside Russia's. On 21 December 1903, the Tar\u014d cabinet voted to go to war against Russia.{{r|Kat\u014d2007_101}}\n\n[[File:Shinichiro Kurino.jpg|thumb|Kurino Shin'ichir\u014d]]\n\nBy 4 February 1904, no formal reply had been received and on 6 February the Japanese minister to Russia, [[Shinichiro Kurino|Kurino Shin'ichir\u014d]] was recalled, and Japan severed diplomatic relations with Russia.{{r|KodaNWCR2005}}\n\nPotential diplomatic resolution of territorial concerns between Japan and Russia failed; historians have argued that this directly resulted from the actions of Tsar [[Nicholas II]]. One crucial error of Nicholas was his mismanagement of government. Although certain scholars contend the situation arose from the determination of Tsar Nicholas II to use the war against Japan to spark a revival in Russian patriotism, no historical evidence supports this claim.{{sfn|Esthus|1981|p=411}} The Tsar's advisors did not support the war, foreseeing problems in transporting troops and supplies from European Russia to the East.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tolf |first=Robert W. |year=1976 |title=The Russian Rockfellers |publisher=Hoover Press |isbn=0-8179-6583-1 |p=156 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3DmsQLtWq1wC }}</ref> Convinced that his rule was divinely ordained and that he held responsibility to God, Nicholas II held the ideals of preserving the autocracy and defending the dignity, honor, and worth of Russia.{{sfn|Esthus|1981|p=397}} This attitude by the Tsar led to repeated delays in negotiations with the Japanese government. The Japanese understanding of this can be seen in a telegram from Japanese minister of foreign affairs, Komura, to the minister to Russia, in which he stated:\n<blockquote>\n...&nbsp;the Japanese government have at all times during the progress of the negotiations made it a special point to give prompt answers to all propositions of the Russian government. The negotiations have now been pending for no less than four months, and they have not yet reached a stage where the final issue can with certainty be predicted. In these circumstances the Japanese government cannot but regard with grave concern the situation for which the delays in negotiations are largely responsible.<ref>{{cite book |title=Baron Komura to Mr. Kurino |date=1 December 1903 }} In {{harvnb|Correspondence Regarding Negotiations|1904|p=[https://archive.org/stream/correspondencere00japarich#page/38/mode/1up 38]}}.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nErrors by Nicholas II in managing the Russian government also led to his misinterpreting the type of situation in which Russia was to become involved with Japan. Some scholars have suggested that Tsar Nicholas II dragged Japan into war intentionally, in hopes of reviving Russian nationalism. This notion is disputed by a comment made by Nicholas to Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, saying there would be no war because he \"did not wish it\".{{sfn|Schimmelpenninck van der Oye|2005|p=42}}\nThis does not reject the claim that Russia played an aggressive role in the East, which it did; rather, it means that Russia unwisely calculated that Japan would not go to war against its far larger and seemingly superior navy and army. Nicholas held the Japanese in contempt as \"yellow monkeys\", and he took for granted that the Japanese would simply yield in the face of Russia's superior power, which thus explains his unwillingness to compromise.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|pp=16\u201320}} Evidence of Russia's false sense of security and superiority to Japan is seen by Russian reference to Japan choosing war as a big mistake.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|p=21}}\n\n== Declaration of war ==\n[[File:Manchuria.png|thumb|Greater Manchuria.

A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which Admiral T\u014dg\u014d was unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully as it was protected by the shore batteries of the harbour, and the Russians were reluctant to leave the harbour for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral [[Stepan Osipovich Makarov]] on 13 April 1904. Although the actual Battle of Port Arthur was indecisive, the initial attacks had a devastating psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident about the prospect of war. The Japanese had seized the initiative while the Russians waited in port.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThese engagements provided cover for a Japanese landing near [[Incheon]] in Korea. From Incheon the Japanese occupied Hanseong and then the rest of Korea. By the end of April, the Japanese Imperial Army under [[Kuroki Tamemoto]] was ready to cross the [[Yalu River]] into Russian-occupied Manchuria.\n\n=== Blockade of Port Arthur ===\n[[File:Battlefields in the Russo Japanese War.jpg|thumb|Battlefields in the Russo-Japanese War]]\n\nThe Japanese attempted to deny the Russians use of Port Arthur. During the night of 13\u201314 February, the Japanese attempted to block the entrance to Port Arthur by sinking several concrete-filled steamers in the deep water channel to the port,{{sfn|Tikowara/Grant|1907|p=48\u201350}} but they sank too deep to be effective. A similar attempt to block the harbour entrance during the night of 3\u20134 May also failed. In March, the charismatic Vice Admiral [[Stepan Makarov|Makarov]] had taken command of the First Russian Pacific Squadron with the intention of breaking out of the Port Arthur blockade.\n\nOn 12 April 1904, two Russian [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships, the flagship [[Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1894)|''Petropavlovsk'']] and the [[Russian battleship Pobeda|''Pobeda'']], slipped out of port but struck Japanese mines off Port Arthur. The ''Petropavlovsk'' sank almost immediately, while the ''Pobeda'' had to be towed back to port for extensive repairs. Admiral Makarov, the single most effective Russian naval strategist of the war, died on the battleship ''Petropavlovsk''.\n\nOn 15 April 1904, the Russian government made overtures threatening to seize the British [[war correspondent]]s who were taking the ship [[SS Haimun|''Haimun'']] into warzones to report for the London-based [[The Times|''Times'']] newspaper, citing concerns about the possibility of the British giving away Russian positions to the Japanese fleet.\n\nThe Russians quickly learned, and soon employed, the Japanese tactic of offensive minelaying. On 15 May 1904, two Japanese battleships, the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yashima||2}} and the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hatsuse||2}}, were lured into a recently laid Russian minefield off Port Arthur, each striking at least two mines. The ''Hatsuse'' sank within minutes, taking 450 sailors with her, while the ''Yashima'' sank while under tow towards Korea for repairs. On 23 June 1904, a [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|breakout attempt]] by the Russian squadron, now under the command of Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]], failed. By the end of the month, Japanese artillery were firing shells into the harbour.\n\n=== Siege of Port Arthur ===\n{{Main|Siege of Port Arthur}}\n[[File:Fire of the Oil Depot Caused by Our Gunfire.jpg|thumb|Bombardment during the [[Siege of Port Arthur]]]]\n\nThe Siege of Port Arthur commenced in April 1904. Japanese troops tried numerous frontal assaults on the fortified hilltops overlooking the harbour, which were defeated with Japanese casualties in the thousands. Eventually, though, with the aid of several batteries of 11-inch (280&nbsp;mm) [[28&nbsp;cm Howitzer L/10|Armstrong howitzers]], the Japanese were able to capture the key hilltop bastion in December 1904. From this vantage point, the long-range artillery was able to shell the Russian fleet, which was unable to retaliate effectively against the land-based artillery and was unable or unwilling to sail out against the blockading fleet. Four Russian battleships and two cruisers were sunk in succession, with the fifth and last battleship being forced to scuttle a few weeks later. Thus, all [[capital ship]]s of the Russian fleet in the Pacific were sunk. This is probably the only example in military history when such a scale of devastation was achieved by land-based artillery against major warships.\n\n[[File:Assaut-Kin-Tch\u00e9ou.jpg|thumb|Japanese assault on the entrenched Russian forces, 1904]]\nMeanwhile, attempts to relieve the besieged city by land also failed, and, after the [[Battle of Liaoyang]] in late August, the northern Russian force that might have been able to relieve Port Arthur retreated to Mukden ([[Shenyang]]). Major General [[Anatoly Stessel]], commander of the Port Arthur garrison, believed that the purpose of defending the city was lost after the fleet had been destroyed.\nIn general, the Russian defenders were suffering disproportionate casualties each time the Japanese attacked. In particular, several large underground [[Mining (military)|mines]] were exploded in late December, resulting in the costly capture of a few more pieces of the defensive line.\nStessel, therefore, decided to surrender to the surprised Japanese generals on 2 January 1905. He made his decision without consulting either the other military staff present, or the Tsar and military command, who all disagreed with the decision. Stessel was convicted by a [[court-martial]] in 1908 and sentenced to death on account of an incompetent defense and for disobeying orders. He was later pardoned.\n\n=== Anglo\u2013Japanese intelligence co-operation ===\nEven before the war, British and Japanese intelligence had co-operated against Russia due to the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]].{{sfn|Chapman|2004|p=42}} During the war, [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] stations in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and China often intercepted and read wireless and telegraph cable traffic relating to the war, which was shared with the Japanese.{{sfn|Chapman|2004|p=55}} In their turn, the Japanese shared information about Russia with the British with one British official writing of the \"perfect quality\" of Japanese intelligence. In particular, British and Japanese intelligence gathered much evidence that Germany was supporting Russia in the war as part of a bid to disturb the balance of power in Europe, which led to British officials increasingly perceiving that country as a threat to the international order.{{sfn|Chapman|2004|pp=52\u20134}}\n\n=== Battle of Yalu River ===\n{{Main|Battle of Yalu River (1904)}}\n\nIn contrast to the Japanese strategy of rapidly gaining ground to control Manchuria, Russian strategy focused on fighting delaying actions to gain time for reinforcements to arrive via the long Trans-Siberian Railway, which was incomplete near [[Irkutsk]] at the time. On 1 May 1904, the [[Battle of Yalu River (1904)|Battle of Yalu River]] became the first major land battle of the war; Japanese troops stormed a Russian position after crossing the river. The defeat of the Russian Eastern Detachment removed the perception that the Japanese would be an easy enemy, that the war would be short, and that Russia would be the overwhelming victor.{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|p=65}} This was also the first battle in decades to be an Asian victory over a European power and marked Russia's inability to match Japan's military prowess.{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|p=86}} Japanese troops proceeded to land at several points on the Manchurian coast, and in a series of engagements, drove the Russians back towards Port Arthur. The subsequent battles, including the [[Battle of Nanshan]] on 25 May 1904, were marked by heavy Japanese losses largely from attacking entrenched Russian positions.\n\n=== Battle of the Yellow Sea ===\n{{Main|Battle of the Yellow Sea}}\n\nWith the death of Admiral [[Stepan Makarov]] during the siege of Port Arthur in April 1904, Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]] was appointed commander of the battle fleet and was ordered to make a [[sortie]] from Port Arthur and deploy his force to [[Vladivostok]]. Flying his flag in the French-built pre-dreadnought ''[[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|Tsesarevich]]'', Vitgeft proceeded to lead his six battleships, four [[cruiser]]s, and 14 [[torpedo boat destroyers]] into the Yellow Sea in the early morning of 10 August 1904. Waiting for him was Admiral T\u014dg\u014d and his fleet of four battleships, 10 cruisers, and 18 torpedo boat destroyers.\n\nAt approximately 12:15, the battleship fleets obtained visual contact with each other, and at 13:00 with T\u014dg\u014d [[Crossing the T|crossing Vitgeft's ''T'']], they commenced main battery fire at a range of about eight miles, the longest ever conducted up to that time.{{sfn|Forczyk|2009|p=50}} For about thirty minutes the battleships pounded one another until they had closed to less than four miles and began to bring their secondary batteries into play. At 18:30, a hit from one of T\u014dg\u014d's battleships struck Vitgeft's flagship's bridge, killing him instantly.\n\nWith the ''Tsesarevich''{{'}}s helm jammed and their admiral killed in action, she turned from her battle line, causing confusion among her fleet. However, T\u014dg\u014d was determined to sink the Russian flagship and continued pounding her, and it was saved only by the gallant charge of the American-built Russian battleship ''[[Russian battleship Retvizan|Retvizan]]'', whose captain successfully drew away T\u014dg\u014d's heavy fire from the Russian flagship.{{sfn|Forczyk|2009|p=53}} Knowing of the impending battle with the battleship reinforcements arriving from Russia (the Baltic Fleet), T\u014dg\u014d chose not to risk his battleships by pursuing his enemy as they turned about and headed back into Port Arthur, thus ending naval history's longest-range gunnery duel up to that time and the first modern clash of steel battleship fleets on the high seas.\n\n=== Baltic Fleet redeploys ===\n[[File:Battle of Japan Sea (Route of Baltic Fleet) NT.PNG|thumb|Route of Baltic Fleet, to and back]]\n\nMeanwhile, the Russians were preparing to reinforce their Far East Fleet by sending the [[Baltic Fleet]], under the command of Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]]. After a false start caused by engine problems and other mishaps, the squadron finally departed on 15 October 1904, and sailed halfway around the world from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the Pacific via the [[Cape Route]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in the course of a seven-month odyssey that was to attract worldwide attention. The [[Dogger Bank incident]] on 21 October 1904, where the Russian fleet fired on British fishing boats that they mistook for enemy torpedo boats, nearly sparked a war with the United Kingdom (an ally of Japan, but neutral, unless provoked). During the voyage, the fleet separated into a portion that went through the Suez Canal while the larger battleships went around the [[Cape of Good Hope]].\n\n=== The fate of the civilians ===\nDuring the fighting in Manchuria, Russian troops [[Looting|looted]] and burned some Chinese villages, raped women and often killed those who resisted or did not understand what they wanted.<ref name=Jukes2002_84>{{harvnb|Jukes|2002|p=84}}.</ref> The Russian justification for all this was that Chinese civilians, being Asian, must have been helping their fellow Asians (the Japanese) inflict defeat on the Russians, and therefore deserved to be punished. The Russian troops were gripped by the fear of the \"[[Yellow Peril]]\", and saw all Asians, not just the Japanese, as the enemy.{{r|Jukes2002_84}} All of the Russian soldiers were much feared by the Chinese population of Manchuria, but it was the Cossacks whom they feared the most on the account of their brutality and insatiable desire to loot. Largely because of the more disciplined behavior of the Japanese, the Han and Manchu population of Manchuria tended to be pro-Japanese.{{r|Jukes2002_84}} However Japanese were also prone to looting, albeit in a considerably less brutal manner than the Russians, and summarily executed any Chinese or Manchu whom they suspected of being spies. The city of Liaoyang had the misfortune to be sacked three times within three days: first by the Russians, then by the Chinese police, and finally by the Japanese.{{r|Jukes2002_84}} The Japanese hired Chinese bandits known variously as the Chunguses, Chunchuse or ''khunhuzy'' to engage in guerrilla warfare by attacking Russian supply columns.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|pp=84\u20135}} Only once did the Chunguses attack Japanese forces, and that attack was apparently motivated by the Chunguses mistaking the Japanese forces for a Russian one.<ref name=Jukes2002_85>{{harvnb|Jukes|2002|p=85}}.</ref> [[Zhang Zuolin]], a prominent bandit leader and the future \"Old Marshal\" who would rule Manchuria as a warlord between 1916 and 1928, worked as a Chunguse for the Japanese. Manchuria was still officially part of the Chinese Empire, and the Chinese civil servants tried their best to be neutral as Russian and Japanese troops marched across Manchuria. In the parts of Manchuria occupied by the Japanese, Tokyo appointed \"civil governors\" who worked to improve health, sanitation and the state of the roads.{{r|Jukes2002_85}} These activities were also self-interested, as improved roads lessened Japanese logistics problems while improved health amongst the Chinese lessened the dangers of diseases infecting the Japanese troops. By contrast, the Russians made no effort to improve sanitation or health amongst the Chinese, and destroyed everything when they retreated. Many Chinese tended to see the Japanese as the lesser evil.{{r|Jukes2002_85}}\n\n== Campaign of 1905 ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}<!--Summary portions also need citations per [[WP:Summary style]].-->\n[[File:Retreat of the Russian Army after the Battle of Mukden.jpg|thumb|Retreat of Russian soldiers after the [[Battle of Mukden]]]]\n\nWith the fall of [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]], the Japanese 3rd Army could continue northward to reinforce positions south of Russian-held [[Mukden]].

This caught the Japanese by surprise. However, without support from other Russian units the attack stalled, Gripenberg was ordered to halt by [[Aleksey Kuropatkin|Kuropatkin]] and the battle was inconclusive.

In the following days Japanese forces proceeded to assault the right and left flanks of Russian forces surrounding Mukden, along a {{convert|50|mi|km|-1|adj=on}} front. Approximately half a million men were involved in the fighting. Both sides were well entrenched and were backed by hundreds of artillery pieces. After days of harsh fighting, added pressure from the flanks forced both ends of the Russian defensive line to curve backwards. Seeing they were about to be encircled, the Russians began a general retreat, fighting a series of fierce rearguard actions, which soon deteriorated in the confusion and collapse of Russian forces. On 10 March 1905, after three weeks of fighting, [[General Kuropatkin]] decided to withdraw to the north of Mukden. The Russians suffered 90,000 casualties in the battle.\n\nThe retreating Russian Manchurian Army formations disbanded as fighting units, but the Japanese failed to destroy them completely. The Japanese themselves had suffered heavy casualties and were in no condition to pursue.

Admiral Rozhestvensky's only hope now was to reach the port of Vladivostok. There were three routes to Vladivostok, with the shortest and most direct passing through [[Tsushima Strait]] between Korea and Japan. However, this was also the most dangerous route as it passed between the Japanese home islands and the Japanese naval bases in Korea.\n\nAdmiral T\u014dg\u014d was aware of Russian progress and understood that, with the fall of Port Arthur, the Second and Third Pacific squadrons would try to reach the only other Russian port in the Far East, Vladivostok. Battle plans were laid down and ships were repaired and refitted to intercept the Russian fleet.\n\nThe Japanese [[Combined Fleet]], which had originally consisted of six battleships, was now down to four (two had been lost to mines), but still retained its cruisers, destroyers, and torpedo boats. The Russian Second Pacific Squadron contained eight battleships, including four new battleships of the [[Borodino-class battleship|''Borodino'' class]], as well as cruisers, destroyers and other auxiliaries for a total of 38 ships.\n\nBy the end of May, the Second Pacific Squadron was on the last leg of its journey to Vladivostok, taking the shorter, riskier route between Korea and Japan, and travelling at night to avoid discovery.

Technological developments of modern armaments, such as rapid-firing artillery and machine guns, as well as more accurate rifles, were first used on a mass scale in the Russo-Japanese War. The improved capability of naval forces was also demonstrated. Military operations on both sea and land demonstrated that warfare in a new age of technology had undergone a considerable change since the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u201371.{{r|Steinberg2008_7}}\nMost army commanders had previously envisioned using these weapon systems to dominate the battlefield on an operational and tactical level but, as events played out, these technological advancements forever altered the capacity in which mankind would wage war.{{sfn|Schimmelpenninck van der Oye|2005|p=84}}\nFor East Asia it was the first confrontation after thirty years involving two modern armed forces.\n\nThe advanced weaponry led to massive casualty counts. Neither Japan nor Russia had prepared for the number of deaths that would occur in this new kind of warfare, or had the resources to compensate for these losses. This also left its impression on society at large, with the emergence of transnational and [[nongovernmental organization]]s, like the [[Red Cross]], becoming prominent after the war. The emergence of such organizations can be regarded as the beginning of a meshing together of civilizations through the identification of common problems and challenges, a slow process dominating much of the 20th century.{{sfn|Steinberg|2008|p=6}}\n\nDebate with respect to the Russo-Japanese War preluding World War II is a topic of interest to scholars today. Arguments that are favorable toward this perspective consider characteristics specific to the Russo-Japanese War to the qualities definitive of \"[[total war]]\".{{sfn|Steinberg|2008|p=3}} Numerous aspects of total war characterize the Russo-Japanese War. Encompassed on both ends was the mass mobilization of troops into battle. For both Russia and Japan, the war required extensive economic support in the form of production of equipment, armaments, and supplies at such a scale that both domestic support and foreign aid were required.{{r|Steinberg2008_7}} The conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War also demonstrated the need for world leaders to regard domestic response to foreign policy, which is argued by some scholars as setting in motion the dissolution of the Romanov dynasty by demonstrating the inefficiencies of tsarist Russia's government.{{r|Steinberg2008_7}}\n\n=== Reception around the world ===\n[[File:\uc77c\ubcf8\uacfc \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544\uc5d0 \uc555\uc0ac\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d.png|thumb|Postcard of political satire during the Russo-Japanese War]]\nTo the Western powers, Japan's victory demonstrated the emergence of a new Asian regional power. With the Russian defeat, some scholars have argued that the war had set in motion a change in the global world order with the emergence of Japan as not only a regional power, but rather, the main Asian power.{{sfn|Schimmelpenninck van der Oye|2005|p=83}} Rather more than the possibilities of diplomatic partnership were emerging, however.

The cost of military re-equipment and re-expansion after 1905 pushed the economy further into deficit, although the size of the deficit was obscured.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|p=844}}\n\nThe Japanese were on the offensive for most of the war and used massed infantry assaults against defensive positions, which would later become the standard of all European armies during World War I. The battles of the Russo-Japanese War, in which machine guns and artillery took a heavy toll on Russian and Japanese troops, were a precursor to the [[trench warfare]] of World War I.{{sfn|Keegan|1999|pp=179, 229, 230}} A German military advisor sent to Japan, [[Jakob Meckel]], had a tremendous impact on the development of the Japanese military training, tactics, strategy, and organization. His reforms were credited with Japan's overwhelming victory over China in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894\u20131895. However, his over-reliance on infantry in [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] campaigns also led to a large number of Japanese casualties.\n\n[[File:Dadao map 1939.svg|thumb|280px|[[Japanese Empire]]'s territorial expansion]]\nMilitary and economic exhaustion affected both countries. Japanese historians regard this war as a turning point for Japan, and a key to understanding the reasons why Japan may have failed militarily and politically later. After the war, acrimony was felt at every level of Japanese society and it became the consensus within Japan that their nation had been treated as the defeated power during the peace conference.{{r|NYT3Sep1905}} As time went on, this feeling, coupled with the sense of \"arrogance\" at becoming a [[Great Power]], grew and added to growing Japanese hostility towards the West, and fueled Japan's military and imperial ambitions. Furthermore, Japan's substantiated interests in Korea and Liaodong led to the creation of a [[Kwantung Army]], which became an autonomous and increasingly powerful regional force. Only five years after the war, Japan ''de jure'' annexed Korea as part of its colonial empire. Two decades after that, the Kwantung Army staged an incident that led to the invasion of Manchuria in the [[Mukden Incident]]; the Kwantung Army eventually came to be heavily involved in the state's politics and administration, leading to a series of localized conflicts with Chinese regional warlords that finally extended into the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937. As a result, most Chinese historians consider the Russo-Japanese War as a key development in Japan's spiral into [[Japanese militarism|militarism]] in the 1920s\u201330s.\n\nFollowing the victory of the [[Battle of Tsushima]], Japan's erstwhile British ally presented a lock of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson's]] hair to the Imperial Japanese Navy, judging its performance then as on a par with Britain's victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] in 1805. It is still on display at Kyouiku Sankoukan, a public museum maintained by the Japan Self-Defense Force. Nevertheless, there was a consequent change in British strategic thinking, resulting in enlargement of its naval docks at [[Auckland]], New Zealand; [[Bombay]], [[British Raj|British India]]; [[Fremantle]] and Sydney, Australia; [[Simon's Town]], [[Cape Colony]]; Singapore and [[British Hong Kong]]. The naval war confirmed the direction of the [[British Admiralty]]'s thinking in tactical terms even as it undermined its strategic grasp of a changing world. Tactical orthodoxy, for example, assumed that a naval battle would imitate the conditions of stationary combat and that ships would engage in one long line sailing on parallel courses; but more flexible tactical thinking would now be required as a firing ship and its target maneuvered independently.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|p=384, 386, 388}}\n\n== Military attach\u00e9s and observers ==\n{{Main|Military attach\u00e9s and observers in the Russo-Japanese War}}\n[[File:General Kuroki and his Staffs, Foreign Officiers and Correspondents.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Japanese general, Kuroki, and his staff, including foreign officers and war correspondents after the [[Battle of Shaho]] (1904)]]\n\nMilitary and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. Most were able to report on events from the perspective of [[embedded journalist|embedded]] positions within the land and naval forces of both Russia and Japan. These military attach\u00e9s and other observers prepared first-hand accounts of the war and analytical papers. In-depth observer narratives of the war and more narrowly focused professional journal articles were written soon after the war; and these post-war reports conclusively illustrated the battlefield destructiveness of this conflict. This was the first time the tactics of entrenched positions for infantry defended with machine guns and artillery became vitally important. Both would become dominant factors in World War I.\nEven though entrenched positions had already been a significant part of both the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[American Civil War]], it is now apparent that the high casualty counts, and the tactical lessons readily available to observer nations, were completely disregarded in preparations for war in Europe, and during much of the course of World War I.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Sisemore |first=James D. |year=1991 |title=The Russo-Japanese War, Lessons Not Learned |location=Fort Leavenworth, KS |publisher=[[U.S. Army Command and General Staff College]] |p=iii |url=http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p4013coll2&CISOPTR=113 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1904\u20131905, [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton]] was the military attach\u00e9 of the [[British Indian Army]] serving with the Imperial Japanese Army in Manchuria.

These had been common during the Sino-Japanese war a decade earlier and celebrations of the new conflict tended to repeat the same imagery and situations. But by this time in Japan postcards had become the most common form of communication and they soon replaced prints as a medium for topographical imagery and war reportage. In some ways, however, they were still dependent on the print for their pictorial conventions, not least in issuing the cards in series that assembled into a composite scene or design, either as [[diptychs]], [[triptych]]s or even more ambitious formats. However, captioning swiftly moved from the calligraphic side inscription to a printed title below, and not just in Japanese but in English and other European languages.

General [[Nogi Maresuke]]'s \"Outside the Goldland fortress\" was learned by generations of schoolchildren and valued for its bleak stoicism.<ref>{{cite web |title=General Maresuke Nogi (1849\u20131912) |website=War Poets Association |url=http://www.warpoets.org/poets/general-maresuke-nogi-1849-1912 }}</ref> The army surgeon [[Mori \u014cgai]] kept a verse diary which tackled such themes as racism, strategic mistakes and the ambiguities of victory which can now be appreciated in historical hindsight.<ref>Collected works in {{harvnb|Wells|Wilson|1999|}}, reviewed by Tim Wright in [http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue4/tims_review.html Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context] n. 4 September 2000.</ref> Nowadays too there is growing appreciation of [[Yosano Akiko]]'s parting poem to her brother as he left for the war, which includes the critical lines.\n\n{{poemquote|\nNever let them kill you, brother!\nHis Imperial Majesty would not come out to fight&nbsp;...\nHow could He possibly make them believe\nthat it is honourable to die?<ref>See {{cite website |author=Janine Beichman |date=11 December 2006 |title=Thou Shalt Not Die: Yosano Akiko and the Russo-Japanese War |website=Asiatic Society of Japan |url=http://www.asjapan.org/web.php/lectures/2006/12 |access-date=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609035209/http://www.asjapan.org/web.php/lectures/2006/12 |archive-date=9 June 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}\n\nEven the [[Emperor Meiji]] himself entered the poetic lists, writing in answer to all the lamentations about death in a foreign land that the patriotic soul returns to the homeland.<ref>{{cite book |author=Takashi Fujitani |year=1996 |title=Splendid Monarchy: Power and Pageantry in Modern Japan |publisher=University of California Press |p=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHWE7SWePgIC&lpg=PA126&ots=MduFgkn-35&dq=russo%20japanese%20war%20%20%22poem%22&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q=russo%20japanese%20war%20%20%22poem%22&f=false }}</ref>\n\nEuropean treatments were similarly varied.

This follows the voyage of the Russian Imperial Navy flagship ''Kniaz'' to its sinking at the Battle of Tsushima.<ref>See the account by {{cite journal |author=David Wheatley |title=Dialect with Army and Navy |journal=The London Review of Books |volume=23 |issue=12 |date=21 June 2001 |pp=40\u20131 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n12/david-wheatley/dialect-with-army-and-navy }}</ref>\n\n=== Fiction ===\nFictional coverage of the war in English began even before it was over. An early example was [[Allen Upward]]'s ''The International Spy''. Set in both Russia and Japan, it ends with the Dogger Bank incident involving the Baltic Fleet.<ref>{{cite book |last=Upward |first=Allen |year=1904 |title=The International Spy \u2013 Being the secret history of the Russo-Japanese War |publisher=M.A. Donohue & Co |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30482 }}</ref> The political thinking displayed there is typical of the time. There is great admiration for the Japanese, who were British allies. Russia is in turmoil, but the main impetus towards war is not imperialism as such but commercial forces. \"Every student of modern history has remarked the fact that all recent wars have been promoted by great combinations of capitalists. The causes which formerly led to war between nation and nation have ceased to operate\" (p.&nbsp;40). The true villain plotting in the background, however, is the German Emperor, seeking to destabilise the European balance of power in his country's favour. Towards the end of the novel, the narrator steals a German submarine and successfully foils a plot to involve the British in the war. The submarine motif reappeared in [[George Griffith]]'s science fiction novel, ''The Stolen Submarine'' (1904), although in this case it is a French super-submarine which its developer sells to the Russians for use against the Japanese in another tale of international intrigue.<ref>E.F. and R. Bleiler, Science Fiction: The Early Years, Kent State University 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KEZxhkG5eikC&lpg=PA955&ots=M2IiJYwF8t&dq=%22The%20stolen%20submarine%22%20griffiths&pg=PA308#v=onepage&q=%22The%20stolen%20submarine%22%20griffiths&f=false p.308]</ref>\n\nThough most English-language fiction of the period took the Japanese side, the Rev. W. W. Walker's Canadian novella, ''Alter Ego'', is an exception. It features a Canadian volunteer in the Russian army who, on his return, agrees to talk about his experiences to an isolated upcountry community and relates his part in the Battle of Mukden.<ref>{{cite book |author=Walker, W.W. |year=1907 |title=Alter Ego: a Tale |location=Toronto |publisher=William Briggs |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37731 }}</ref> Though this incident only occupies two of the book's six chapters, it is used to illustrate the main message there, that war is \"anti-Christian and barbarous, except in a defensive sense\" (Ch.3).\n\n[[File:MIKASAPAINTING.jpg|thumb|Painting of Admiral [[Heihachir\u014d T\u014dg\u014d]] on the bridge of the [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|Japanese battleship ''Mikasa'']], before the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905]]\nVarious aspects of the war were also common in contemporary children's fiction. Categorised as [[Boys' Own]] adventure stories, they offer few insights into the conflict, being generally based on news articles and sharing unreflectingly in the contemporary culture of imperialism.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Russo-Japanese War and Boys Own Adventure Stories |website=The Russo-Japanese War Research Society |url=http://russojapanesewar.com/boys-own.html |access-date=16 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023400/http://russojapanesewar.com/boys-own.html |archive-date=21 June 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Among these, [[Herbert Strang]] was responsible for two novels: ''Kobo'' told from the Japanese side,<ref>{{cite book |last=Strang |first=Herbert |year=1905 |title=Kobo |publisher=G.P.

Two other English-language stories begin with the action at Port Arthur and follow the events thereafter: ''A Soldier of Japan: a tale of the Russo-Japanese War'' by Captain [[Frederick Sadleir Brereton]], and ''The North Pacific''<ref>{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Willis B. |year=1905 |title=The North Pacific \u2013 A Story of the Russo-Japanese War |location=New York City |publisher=E.P. Dutton & Co |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45413 }}</ref> by Willis Boyd Allen (1855\u20131938). Two more also involve young men fighting in the Japanese navy: Americans in ''For the Mikado''<ref>{{cite book |last=Munroe |first=Kirk |year=1905 |title=For the Mikado or a Japanese Middy in Action |publisher=Harper & brothers |url=https://archive.org/details/formikadoorajap00munrgoog }}</ref> by [[Kirk Munroe]], and a temporarily disgraced English officer in ''Under the Ensign of the Rising Sun''<ref>{{cite book |last=Collingwood |first=Harry |year=1916 |title=Under the Ensign of the Rising Sun \u2013 A Story of the Russo-Japanese War |location=New York City |publisher=Silver Scroll |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27910 }}</ref> by Harry Collingwood, the pen-name of William Joseph Cosens Lancaster (1851\u20131922), whose speciality was [[nautical fiction|naval fiction]].\n\nAnother literary genre affected by the outcome of the war was [[invasion literature]], either fuelled by racialist fears or generated by the international power struggle. [[Shunr\u014d Oshikawa]]'s novel ''The Submarine Battleship'' (''Kaitei Gunkan'') was published in 1900 before the actual fighting began but shared the imperial tensions that produced it. It is the story of an armoured ram-armed submarine involved in a Russo-Japanese conflict.<ref>Derek Linney, ''Invasion-Literature, 1871\u20131914'', [http://www.theriddleofthesands.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Invasion-Literature-1871-1914-1.pdf p.95]</ref> Three other novels appeared in 1908 and are thought of as significant now because of their prophetic dimension. American author Arthur Wellesley Kipling (1885\u20131947) prefaced his ''The New Dominion \u2013 A Tale of Tomorrow's Wars'' with a note counselling future vigilance. The scenario there is an attack by German and Japanese allies which the US and British navies victoriously fend off.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/newdominionatal00kiplgoog Archived online]</ref> In Germany itself an air attack on the American fleet is described by Ferdinand Heinrich Grautoff (1871\u20131935), writing under the name Parabellum, in his novel ''Banzai!''. Published in Berlin in 1908, it was translated into English the following year.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19498/19498-h/19498-h.htm Gutenberg]</ref> An Australian author using the pseudonym Charles H. Kirmess first serialised his ''The Commonwealth Crisis'' and then revised it for book publication as ''The Australian Crisis'' in 1909. It is set in 1912 and told from the standpoint of 1922, following a military invasion of Australia's Northern Territory and colonisation by Japanese settlers.<ref>[http://www.australianculture.org/the-australian-crisis Text online]</ref>\n\nMost Russian fictional accounts of the war had a documentary element. [[Alexey Novikov-Priboy]] had served in the Baltic Fleet and wrote about the conflict on his return, but his early work was suppressed. It was not until the changed political climate under Soviet rule that he began writing his historical epic ''Tsushima'', based on his own experiences on board the battleship ''Orel'' as well as on testimonies of fellow sailors and government archives. The first part was published in 1932, the second in 1935, and the whole novel was later awarded the [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]]. It describes the heroism of Russian sailors and certain officers whose defeat, in accordance with the new Soviet thinking, was due to the criminal negligence of the Imperial Naval command. A German novel by [[Frank Thiess]], originally published as ''Tsushima'' in 1936 (and later translated as ''The Voyage of Forgotten Men''), covered the same journey round the world to defeat.\n\nLater there appeared a first-hand account of the siege of Port Arthur by Alexander Stepanov (1892\u20131965). He had been present there as the 12-year-old son of a battery commander and his novel, ''Port Arthur: a historical narrative'' (1944), is based on his own diaries and his father's notes. The work is considered one of the best historical novels of the Soviet period.<ref>{{cite book |author=Aleksandr N Stepanov |year=1947 |translator=J. Fineberg |title=Port Arthur: a historical narrative |publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3QMDAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> A later novel in which the war appears is [[Valentin Pikul]]'s ''The Three Ages of Okini-San'' (1981). Centred on the life of Vladimir Kokovtsov, who rose through the ranks to admiral of the Russian fleet, it covers the period from the Russo-Japanese War through to the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s. A much later Russian genre novel uses the period of the war as background. This is [[Boris Akunin]]'s ''[[The Diamond Chariot]]'' (2003), in the first part of which the detective [[Erast Fandorin]] is charged with protecting the Trans-Siberian Railway from Japanese sabotage.\n\nThe main historical novel dealing with the war from the Japanese side is [[Shiba Ry\u014dtar\u014d]]'s ''[[Saka no Ue no Kumo|Clouds Above the Hill]]'', published serially in several volumes between 1968 and 1972, and translated in English in 2013. The closely researched story spans the decade from the Sino-Japanese War to the Russo-Japanese War and went on to become the nation's favourite book.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hiroaki Sato |title=Multiple perspectives in novel on the Russo-Japanese War |newspaper=The Japan Times |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/07/27/books/book-reviews/multiple-perspectives-in-novel-on-the-russo-japanese-war/#.VWzWUVJS8SV |accessdate=27 July 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n{{See also|List of war films and TV specials#Russo-Japanese War .281904.E2.80.931905.29|l1=Film list about the Russo-Japanese War}}\n* [[Port Arthur (film)|''Port Arthur'']] (1936)\n* ''[[Cruiser 'Varyag'|Kreiser Varyag]]'' (1946)<ref>''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3or0DRS_uc Kreiser Varyag'' on YouTube, Russian language only]</ref> \n* ''[[Nichiro sens\u014d sh\u014dri no hishi: Tekich\u016b \u014ddan sanbyaku-ri]]'' (1957)\n* ''[[Meiji tenn\u00f4 to nichiro daisenso]]'' (1958)\n* ''[[The Battle of the Japan Sea]]'' (1969, {{lang|ja|\u4f50\u85e4 \u52dd: \u65e5\u672c\u6d77\u5927\u6d77\u6226}}, ''Nihonkai-Daikaisen'') depicts the naval battles of the war, the attacks on the Port Arthur highlands, and the subterfuge and diplomacy of Japanese agents in Sweden.

For centuries, [[Poland]] was home to the largest and most significant [[Jew]]ish community in the world. Poland was a principal center of [[Jewish culture]], thanks to a long period of statutory [[toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Qahal|social autonomy]] which ended with the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the 18th century. During [[World War II]] there was a nearly complete [[genocide|genocidal]] destruction of the Polish Jewish community by [[Nazi Germany]] and its collaborators, during the 1939\u20131945 [[German occupation of Poland]] and the ensuing [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Since the [[fall of communism in Poland]], there has been a renewed interest in Jewish culture, featuring an annual [[Jewish Culture Festival]], new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities, and [[Warsaw]]'s [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]].\n\nFrom the founding of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 through to the early years of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[Union of Lublin|created in 1569]], [[Poland]] was the most tolerant country in Europe.<ref name=\"Hugh\"/> Historians have used the label ''[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|paradisus iudaeorum]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"[[Paradise]] of the Jews\").<ref name=\"Engel2009\">Engel, David. \"On Reconciling the Histories of Two Chosen Peoples.\" The American Historical Review 114.4 (2009): 914-929.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polin.pl/en/wystawy-wystawa-glowna-galerie/paradisus-iudaeorum|title=Paradisus Iudaeorum (1569\u20131648)|website=POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews|date=13 May 2013}}</ref> The country became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world's largest Jewish community of the time.

Still, as Poland regained independence in the [[aftermath of World War I]], it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million. [[Antisemitism]] was a growing problem throughout Europe in those years, from both the political establishment and the general population.<ref name=\"Hagen-1\"/> Throughout the [[interwar period]], Poland supported Jewish emigration from Poland and, on the international arena, the creation of a Jewish state in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The Polish state also supported Jewish paramilitary groups such as the [[Haganah]], [[Betar]], and [[Irgun]], providing them with weapons and training.<ref>\"In 1937, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs viewed the [[League of Nations]] as the right place for manifesting its support for the cause of developing a Jewish state in Palestine. This had been declared at the League by Foreign Minister [[J\u00f3zef Beck]].11 He also supported the idea of an international conference and campaign for organising and facilitating Jewish emigration.12 Talks were held with British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]], and in the US, with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Jewish members of the [[Sejm]] who protested against the heightened [[antisemitism]] in Poland took pains to thank Beck for furthering the cause of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine.\" [[Szymon Rudnicki]], [[Marek Karliner]] & [[Laurence Weinbaum]], \"Linking the Vistula and the Jordan: The Genesis of Relations between Poland and the State of Israel\", ''[[Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs]]'', 8:1, 2014, pp. 103-114.</ref><ref>\"Rydz Smig\u0142y agreed to support [[Irgun]], The [[Zionists]]' military arm, for the fight in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].

One-fifth of the Polish population perished during World War II; the 3,000,000 Polish Jews murdered in [[The Holocaust]], who constituted 90% of Polish Jewry, made up half of all Poles killed during the war.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Hidden Jews of Poland | website=Shavei Israel | date=22 November 2015 | url=https://shavei.org/communities/hidden-jews-poland/ | access-date=20 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"YV-archive1\"/> Although the Holocaust occurred largely in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u201345)|German-occupied Poland]], there was little collaboration with the Nazis by its citizens.

For example, they could define their neighborhoods and economic competitors and set up monopolies. This made it very attractive for Jewish communities to pick up and move to Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://henryabramson.com/2013/12/05/origins-of-polish-jewry-this-week-in-jewish-history/|title=Origins of Polish Jewry (This Week in Jewish History)|date=5 December 2013|website=Henry Abramson}}</ref>\n\nThe first mention of Jewish settlers in [[P\u0142ock]] dates from 1237, in Kalisz from 1287 and a \u017bydowska (Jewish) street in Krak\u00f3w in 1304.<ref name=polishjews.org/>\n\nThe tolerant situation was gradually altered by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on the one hand, and by the neighboring German states on the other.<ref name=\"Dubnow-1\"/> There were, however, among the reigning princes some determined protectors of the Jewish inhabitants, who considered the presence of the latter most desirable as far as the economic development of the country was concerned. Prominent among such rulers was [[Boles\u0142aw the Pious]] of [[Kalisz]], Prince of [[Great Poland]]. With the consent of the class representatives and higher officials, in 1264 he issued a General Charter of Jewish Liberties, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], which granted all Jews the freedom of worship, trade and travel. Similar privileges were granted to the Silesian Jews by the local princes, Prince Henry Probus of Wroc\u0142aw in 1273\u201390, Henry of Glogow in 1274 and 1299, Henry of Legnica in 1290 \u2013 95 and Bolko of Legnica and Wroc\u0142aw in 1295.<ref name=polishjews.org/> Article 31 of the Prince Boles\u0142aw of Kalisz's ''privilegium'' tried to rein in the Catholic Church from disseminating [[blood libel]]s against the Jews, by stating: \u201cAccusing Jews of drinking Christian blood is expressly prohibited.

However, those church decrees required the cooperation of the Polish princes for enforcement, which was generally not forthcoming, due to the profits which the Jews' economic activity yielded to the princes.<ref name=polishjews.org/>\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson, Przyj\u0119cie \u017byd\u00f3w.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Casimir the Great]] and the Jews'', by [[Wojciech Gerson]], 1874]]\nIn 1332, King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]] (1303\u20131370) amplified and expanded Boles\u0142aw's old charter with the [[Wi\u015blicki Statute]]. Under his reign, streams of Jewish immigrants headed east to Poland and Jewish settlements are first mentioned as existing in [[Lviv|Lvov]] (1356), [[Sandomierz]] (1367), and [[Kazimierz]] near Krak\u00f3w (1386).<ref name=polishjews.org/> Casimir, who according to a legend had a Jewish lover named [[Esterka]] from [[Opoczno]]<ref name=\"opoczno-1\"/> was especially friendly to the Jews, and his reign is regarded as an era of great prosperity for Polish Jewry, and was nicknamed by his contemporaries \"King of the [[serf]]s and Jews.\" Under [[penalty of death]], he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced [[Christianity|Christian]] [[baptism]]. He inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of [[Jewish]] [[cemeteries]]. Nevertheless, while for the greater part of Casimir\u2019s reign the Jews of Poland enjoyed tranquility, toward its close they were subjected to persecution on account of the [[Black Death]]. In 1348, the first [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libel]] accusation against Jews in Poland was recorded, and in 1367 the first pogrom took place in [[Pozna\u0144]] (Posen).<ref name=\"Poznan-1\"/><!-- 2008 {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} edited out --> Compared with the pitiless destruction of their co-religionists in [[Western Europe]], however, the Polish Jews did not fare badly; and the Jewish masses of Germany fled to the more hospitable cities in Poland.\n\n===The early Jagiellon era: 1385\u20131505===\n{{main|History of Poland (1385\u20131569)}}\nAs a result of the marriage of [[Jogaila|Wladislaus II]] (Jagie\u0142\u0142o) to [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], daughter of [[Louis I of Hungary]], Lithuania was [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Union|united with the kingdom of Poland]].

In 1349 pogroms took place in many towns in Silesia.<ref name=polishjews.org/> There were accusations of [[blood libel]] by the priests, and new riots against the Jews in Pozna\u0144 in 1399. Accusations of blood libel by another fanatic priest led to the riots in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1407, although the royal guard hastened to the rescue.<ref name=\"Dubnow-3\"/> Hysteria caused by Black Death led to additional 14th-century outbreaks of violence against the Jews in [[Kalisz]], Krak\u00f3w and [[Bochnia]]. Traders and artisans jealous of Jewish prosperity, and fearing their rivalry, supported the harassment. In 1423 the statute of Warka forbade Jews the granting of loans against letters of credit or mortgage and limited their operations exclusively to loans made on security of moveable property.<ref name=polishjews.org/> In the 14th and 15th centuries rich Jewish merchants and moneylenders leased the royal mint, salt mines and the collecting of customs and tolls.

For example, Wolczko of Drohobycz, King Ladislaus Jagiello's broker, was the owner of several villages in the Ruthenian voivodship and the soltys (administrator) of the village of Werbiz. Also Jews from Grodno were in this period owners of villages, manors, meadows, fish ponds and mills. However until the end of the 15th century agriculture as a source of income played only a minor role among Jewish families. More important were crafts for the needs of both their fellow Jews and the Christian population (fur making, tanning, tailoring).<ref name=polishjews.org/>\n[[File:Casimir IV Jagiellon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] confirmed and extended Jewish charters in the second half of the 15th century]]\n\nIn 1454 anti-Jewish riots flared up in [[Bohemia]]'s ethnically-German [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and other [[Silesia]]n cities, inspired by a Franciscan friar, [[John of Capistrano]], who accused Jews of profaning the Christian religion. As a result, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Zbigniew Olesnicki then invited John to conduct a similar campaign in Krak\u00f3w and several other cities, to lesser effect. In 1495, Jews were ordered out of the center of Krak\u00f3w and allowed to settle in the \"Jewish town\" of Kazimierz. In the same year, Alexander Jagiellon, following the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|1492 example of Spanish rulers]], banished the Jews from Lithuania.

Indeed, with the expulsion of the [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews from Spain]], Poland became the recognized haven for exiles from Western Europe; and the resulting accession to the ranks of Polish Jewry made it the cultural and spiritual center of the Jewish people.\n\nThe most prosperous period for Polish Jews began following this new influx of Jews with the reign of [[Sigismund I the Old]] (1506\u20131548), who protected the Jews in his realm. His son, [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1548\u20131572), mainly followed his father's tolerant policy and also granted communal-administration autonomy to the Jews and laid the foundation for the power of the ''[[Qahal]]'', or autonomous Jewish community. This period led to the creation of a proverb about Poland being a \"heaven for the Jews\". According to some sources, about three-quarters of all Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.<ref name=Sanford/><ref name=EJC/><ref name=\"relations\"/> In the middle of the 16th century, Poland welcomed the Jewish newcomers from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]], mostly of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] origin. Jewish religious life thrived in many Polish communities. In 1503, the Polish monarchy appointed Rabbi [[Jacob Pollak]], the official Rabbi of Poland, marking the emergence of the Chief Rabbinate. By 1551, Jews were given permission to choose their own Chief Rabbi. The Chief Rabbinate held power over law and finance, appointing judges and other officials. Some power was shared with local councils. The Polish government permitted the Rabbinate to grow in power, to use it for tax collection purposes. Only 30% of the money raised by the Rabbinate served Jewish causes, the rest went to the Crown for protection. In this period Poland-Lithuania became the main center for Ashkenazi Jewry and its ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' achieved fame from the early 16th century.\n\n[[Moses Isserles]] (1520\u20131572), an eminent [[Talmud]]ist of the 16th century, established his [[yeshiva]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]].

The Jewish community suffered greatly during the 1648 Ukrainian Cossack uprising which had been directed primarily against the Polish nobility and landlords.

[[Charles X of Sweden]], at the head of his victorious army, overran the cities of Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw.

Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. Although Jewish losses in those events were high, the Commonwealth lost one third of its population \u2014 approximately three million of its citizens.\n\nThe environment of the Polish Commonwealth, according to Hundert, profoundly affected Jews due to genuinely positive encounter with the Christian culture across the many cities and towns owned by the Polish aristocracy. There was no isolation.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} The Jewish dress resembled that of their Polish neighbor. \"Reports of romances, of drinking together in taverns, and of intellectual conversations are quite abundant.\" Wealthy Jews had Polish noblemen at their table, and served meals on silver plates.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} By 1764, there were about 750,000 Jews in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as ''Polania'' or ''Polin'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and as [[transliteration|transliterated]] into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as \"good omens\" because ''Polania'' can be broken down into three Hebrew words: ''po'' (\"here\"), ''lan'' (\"dwells\"), ''ya'' (\"[[Names of God in Judaism|God]]\"), and ''Polin'' into two words of: ''po'' (\"here\") ''lin'' (\"[you should] dwell\"). The \"message\" was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of [[Sigismund I the Old]] until the Nazi [[Holocaust]], Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Shemu\u2019el ha-Levi]] (Taz) that Poland was a place where \"most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel\" (''Divre David;'' 1689).<ref>[[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Samuel Ha-Levi]], \"Divre \u0304 David Ture \u0304 Zahav\" (1689) in Hebrew.

Quoted by the YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.</ref>\n\n===Jewish learning===\n[[File:Synagoga Zamo\u015b\u0107 VIII 2010.jpg|thumb|Late-[[Renaissance]] [[Zamo\u015b\u0107 Synagogue|synagogue]], [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], Poland, 1610\u201320]]\n''[[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]]'' were established, under the direction of the rabbis, in the more prominent communities. Such schools were officially known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], and their rabbi principals as [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. Important ''yeshivot'' existed in Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, and other cities. Jewish printing establishments came into existence in the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1530 a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Pentateuch]] ([[Torah]]) was printed in Krak\u00f3w; and at the end of the century the Jewish printing houses of that city and [[Lublin]] issued a large number of Jewish books, mainly of a religious character. The growth of [[Talmud|Talmudic scholarship]] in Poland was coincident with the greater prosperity of the Polish Jews; and because of their communal autonomy educational development was wholly one-sided and along Talmudic lines. Exceptions are recorded, however, where Jewish youth sought secular instruction in the European universities. The learned rabbis became not merely expounders of the Law, but also spiritual advisers, teachers, judges, and legislators; and their authority compelled the communal leaders to make themselves familiar with the abstruse questions of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Polish Jewry found its views of life shaped by the spirit of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, whose influence was felt in the home, in school, and in the synagogue.\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century the seeds of Talmudic learning had been transplanted to Poland from [[Bohemia]], particularly from the school of [[Jacob Pollak]], the creator of ''[[Pilpul]]'' (\"sharp reasoning\"). [[Shalom Shachna]] (c. 1500\u20131558), a pupil of Pollak, is counted among the pioneers of Talmudic learning in Poland. He lived and died in [[Lublin]], where he was the head of the ''yeshivah'' which produced the rabbinical celebrities of the following century. Shachna's son Israel became rabbi of Lublin on the death of his father, and Shachna's pupil [[Moses Isserles]] (known as the ''ReMA'') (1520\u20131572) achieved an international reputation among the Jews as the co-author of the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', (the \"Code of Jewish Law\"). His contemporary and correspondent [[Solomon Luria]] (1510\u20131573) of Lublin also enjoyed a wide reputation among his co-religionists; and the authority of both was recognized by the Jews throughout Europe. Heated religious disputations were common, and Jewish scholars participated in them. At the same time, the ''[[Kabbalah]]'' had become entrenched under the protection of [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinism]]; and such scholars as [[Mordecai Jaffe]] and [[Yoel Sirkis]] devoted themselves to its study. This period of great Rabbinical scholarship was interrupted by the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]].\n\n===The rise of Hasidism===\n[[File:Jakub Frank.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Frank]]]]\n{{main|Hasidic Judaism}}\nThe decade from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Cossacks' uprising]] until after the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish war]] (1648\u20131658) left a deep and lasting impression not only on the social life of the Polish-Lithuanian Jews, but on their spiritual life as well. The intellectual output of the Jews of Poland was reduced. The Talmudic learning which up to that period had been the common possession of the majority of the people became accessible to a limited number of students only. What religious study there was became overly formalized, some rabbis busied themselves with quibbles concerning religious laws; others wrote commentaries on different parts of the Talmud in which hair-splitting arguments were raised and discussed; and at times these arguments dealt with matters which were of no practical importance. At the same time, many miracle workers made their appearance among the Jews of Poland, culminating in a series of false \"Messianic\" movements, most famously as [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbatianism]] was succeeded by [[Jacob Frank|Frankism]].\n\nIn this time of [[mysticism]] and overly formal rabbinism came the teachings of [[Israel ben Eliezer]], known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'', or ''BeShT'', (1698\u20131760), which had a profound effect on the Jews of [[Eastern Europe]] and Poland in particular. His disciples taught and encouraged the new fervent brand of [[Judaism]] based on ''[[Kabbalah]]'' known as [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. The rise of Hasidic Judaism within Poland's borders and beyond had a great influence on the rise of [[Haredi Judaism]] all over the world, with a continuous influence through its many [[List of Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic dynasties]] including those of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander]], [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]], [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]], among others.\n\n==The Partitions of Poland==\n[[File:Jewish dress in Poland 17th and 18th century.jpg|thumb|upright|Jewish dress in 17th ''(top)'' and 18th centuries]]\nIn 1742 most of Silesia was lost to [[Prussia]]. Further disorder and anarchy reigned supreme in Poland during the second half of the 18th century, from the accession to the throne of its last king, [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski]] in 1764.

The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous ''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]]'' (\"Commission of National Education\"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One of the members of the commission, ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[Andrzej Zamoyski]], along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some ''szlachta'' and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the [[French Revolution]] of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.\n[[File:Berek joselewicz.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Berek Joselewicz]] (1764\u20131809)]]\nA second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] was made on 17 July 1793.

Following the revolt, the third and final partition of Poland took place in 1795. The territories which included the great bulk of the Jewish population was transferred to Russia, and thus they became subjects of that empire, although in the first half of the 19th century some semblance of a vastly smaller Polish state was preserved, especially in the form of the [[Congress Poland]] (1815\u20131831).\n\nUnder foreign rule many Jews inhabiting formerly Polish lands were indifferent to Polish aspirations for independence.

By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live in the Pale.\n\nTsarist policy towards the Jews of Poland alternated between harsh rules, and inducements meant to break the resistance to large-scale conversion.

The Polish Jews were allowed to establish schools with Russian, German or Polish curricula. They could own land in the territories annexed from Poland. However, they were also restricted from leasing property, teaching in Yiddish, and from entering Russia. They were banned from the [[brewing industry]]. The harshest measures designed to compel Jews to merge into society at large called for their expulsion from small villages, forcing them to move into towns. Once the resettlement began, thousands of Jews lost their only source of income and turned to [[Qahal]] for support.

It extended from the eastern ''pale'', or demarcation line, to the western Russian border with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]) and with [[Austria-Hungary]].\nThe archaic English term ''pale'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[:wikt:palus#Latin|palus]]}}, a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.\n\nWith its large Catholic and Jewish populations, the Pale was acquired by the Russian Empire (which was a majority [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]) in a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers between 1791 and 1835, and lasted until the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917. It comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and mostly corresponded to historical borders of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; it covered much of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of western [[Russia]].\n\nFrom 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]]. At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]], excluded from residency at a number of cities within the Pale. Settlers from  outside the pale were forced to move to small towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s''.\n\nAlthough the Jews were accorded slightly more rights with the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], they were still restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and subject to restrictions on ownership and profession. The existing [[status quo]] was shattered with the [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|assassination of Alexander]] in 1881 \u2013 an act falsely blamed upon the Jews.\n\n===Pogroms in the Russian Empire===\n[[File:Pogrom bialystok.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Russian Army]] assailant in 1906 [[Bia\u0142ystok pogrom]]]]\nThe assassination prompted a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots, called ''[[pogroms]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0301\u043c}};) throughout 1881\u20131884.

Pogroms continued until 1884, with at least tacit government approval. They proved a turning point in the history of the Jews in [[partitioned Poland]] and throughout the world. In 1884, 36 Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] delegates [[Katowice Conference|met in Katowice]], forming the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement.

They included the [[Bia\u0142ystok pogrom]] of 1906 in the [[Grodno Governorate]] of Russian Poland, in which at least 75 Jews were murdered by marauding soldiers and many more Jews were wounded.

Champions of ''Haskalah'', the ''[[Haskalah|Maskilim]]'', pushed for assimilation and integration into Russian culture. At the same time, there was another school of Jewish thought that emphasized traditional study and a Jewish response to the ethical problems of antisemitism and persecution, one form of which was the [[Musar movement]]. Polish Jews generally were less influenced by ''Haskalah'', rather focusing on a strong continuation of their religious lives based on [[Halakha]] (\"rabbis's law\") following primarily [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Hasidic Judaism]], and also adapting to the new [[Religious Zionism]] of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement later in the 19th century.\n\n===Politics in Polish territory===\n[[File:ac.manif1917.jpg|thumb|A [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]ist demonstration, 1917]]\nBy the late 19th century, ''Haskalah'' and the debates it caused created a growing number of political movements within the Jewish community itself, covering a wide range of views and vying for votes in local and regional elections. Zionism became very popular with the advent of the ''[[Poale Zion]]'' socialist party as well as the religious [[Polish Mizrahi]], and the increasingly popular [[General Zionists]]. Jews also took up [[socialism]], forming the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] [[labor union]] which supported assimilation and the [[rights of labor]]. The [[Folkspartei]] (People's Party) advocated, for its part, cultural autonomy and resistance to assimilation. In 1912, ''[[Agudat Israel]]'', a religious party, came into existence.\n\nMany Jews took part in the Polish insurrections, particularly against Russia (since the Tsars discriminated heavily against the Jews). The [[Ko\u015bciuszko Insurrection]] (1794), [[November Insurrection]] (1830\u201331), [[January Insurrection]] (1863) and [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolutionary Movement of 1905]] all saw significant Jewish involvement in the cause of Polish independence.\n\nDuring the [[Second Polish Republic]] period, there were several prominent Jewish politicians in the Polish Sejm, such as [[Apolinary Hartglas]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]]. Many Jewish political parties were active, representing a wide ideological spectrum, from the Zionists, to the socialists to the anti-Zionists. One of the largest of these parties was the Bund, which was strongest in Warsaw and Lodz.\n\nIn addition to the socialists, Zionist parties were also popular, in particular, the Marxist [[Poale Zion]] and the orthodox religious Polish Mizrahi. The [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] party became the most prominent Jewish party in the interwar period and in the 1919 elections to the [[Polish legislative election, 1919|first Polish Sejm]] since the partitions, gained 50% of the Jewish vote.\n\nIn 1914, the German Zionist [[Max Bodenheimer]] founded the short-lived [[German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews]], with the goal of establishing a buffer state (''Pufferstaat'') within the Jewish Pale of Settlement, composed of the [[Partitions of Poland|former Polish provinces annexed by Russia]], being ''de facto'' [[protectorate]] of the [[German Empire]] that would free Jews in the region from Russian oppression. The plan, known as the [[League of East European States]], soon proved unpopular with both German officials and Bodenheimer's colleagues, and was dead by the following year.<ref>[[Walter Laqueur]].

As a result, according to the 1931 census, 79% of the Jews declared Yiddish as their first language, and only 12% listed Polish, with the remaining 9% being Hebrew.<ref name=\"GUS1931\">{{cite book |url=http://statlibr.stat.gov.pl/exlibris/aleph/a22_1/apache_media/VUNVGMLANSCQQFGYHCN3VDLK12A9U5.pdf |title=Drugi Powszechny Spis Ludno\u015bci z dn. 9.XII.1931 r.

Jewish political parties, both the [[Socialist]] [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|General Jewish Labour Bund]] (The Bund), as well as parties of the Zionist right and left wing and religious conservative movements, were represented in the ''[[Sejm]]'' (the Polish Parliament) as well as in the regional councils.<ref>Yad Vashem, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090720013543/http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/image_into.asp?id=7694&lang=EN&type_id=&addr=%2FIMAGE_TYPE%2F7694.JPG  The Bund Council in August 1937, Warsaw, Poland.] Film and Photo Archive.</ref>\n[[File:Isaac Bashevis Singer (upright).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] (Polish: Izaak Zynger), achieved international acclaim as a classic Jewish writer and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1978]]\n\nThe Jewish cultural scene <ref>Aleksander Hertz, Lucjan Dobroszycki [https://books.google.com/books?id=APRYwrQWy-AC&dq=jews+in+polish+culture&printsec=frontcover The Jews in Polish culture], Northwestern University Press, 1988 {{ISBN|0-8101-0758-9}}</ref> was particularly vibrant in pre\u2013World War II Poland, with numerous Jewish publications and more than one hundred periodicals. Yiddish authors, most notably [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], went on to achieve international acclaim as classic Jewish writers; Singer won the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. His brother [[Israel Joshua Singer]] was also a writer. Other Jewish authors of the period, such as [[Bruno Schulz]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Marian Hemar]], [[Emanuel Schlechter]] and [[Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian]], as well as [[Konrad Tom]] and [[Jerzy Jurandot]], were less well known internationally, but made important contributions to Polish literature. Some Polish writers had Jewish roots e.g. [[Jan Brzechwa]] (a favorite poet of Polish children). Singer [[Jan Kiepura]], born of a Jewish mother and Polish father, was one of the most popular artists of that era, and pre-war songs of Jewish composers, including [[Henryk Wars]], [[Jerzy Petersburski]], [[Artur Gold]], [[Henryk Gold]], [[Zygmunt Bia\u0142ostocki]], [[Szymon Kataszek]] and [[Jakub Kagan]], are still widely known in Poland today. Painters became known as well for their depictions of Jewish life. Among them were [[Maurycy Gottlieb]], [[Artur Markowicz]], and [[Maurycy Trebacz]], with younger artists like [[Chaim Goldberg]] coming up in the ranks.\n\nMany Jews were film producers and directors, e.g. [[Micha\u0142 Waszy\u0144ski]] (''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk)]]'', [[Aleksander Ford]] (''[[Children Must Laugh]]'').\n\n[[File:Shimon Peres, Yasser Arafat - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shimon Peres]], born in Poland as Szymon Perski,  served as the ninth [[President of Israel]] between 2007 and 2014]]\n\nScientist [[Leopold Infeld]], mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and professor [[Adam Ulam]] contributed to the world of science. Other Polish Jews who gained international recognition are [[Moses Schorr]], [[Ludwik Zamenhof]] (the creator of [[Esperanto]]), [[Georges Charpak]], [[Samuel Eilenberg]], [[Emanuel Ringelblum]], and [[Artur Rubinstein]], just to name a few from the long list. The term \"[[genocide]]\" was coined by [[Rafa\u0142 Lemkin]] (1900\u20131959), a Polish-Jewish legal scholar. [[Leonid Hurwicz]] was awarded the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Economics]]. The [[YIVO]] (Jidiszer Wissenszaftlecher Institute) Scientific Institute was based in Wilno before transferring to New York during the war. In Warsaw, important centers of Judaic scholarship, such the [[Main Judaic Library]] and the Institute of Judaic Studies were located, along with numerous Talmudic Schools (Jeszybots), religious centers and synagogues, many of which were of high architectural quality. [[Yiddish theatre]] also flourished; Poland had fifteen Yiddish theatres and theatrical groups. Warsaw was home to the most important Yiddish theater troupe of the time, the [[Vilna Troupe]], which staged the first performance of ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' in 1920 at the Elyseum Theatre. Some future Israeli leaders studied at [[University of Warsaw]], including [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yitzhak Shamir]].\n\nThere also were several Jewish sports clubs, with some of them, such as [[Hasmonea Lwow]] and [[Jutrzenka Krak\u00f3w]], winning promotion to the [[Ekstraklasa|Polish First Football League]]. A Polish-Jewish footballer, [[J\u00f3zef Klotz]], scored the first ever goal for the [[Poland national football team]].

Some scholars note that while not pro-Communist, many Jews saw the Soviets as the lesser threat compared to the German Nazis. They stress that stories of Jews welcoming the Soviets on the streets, vividly remembered by many Poles from the [[Kresy|eastern part of the country]] are impressionistic and not reliable indicators of the level of Jewish support for the Soviets. Additionally, it has been noted that some ethnic Poles were as prominent as Jews in filling civil and police positions in the occupation administration, and that Jews, both civilians and in the Polish military, suffered equally at the hands of the Soviet occupiers.<ref>Samuel D.

A larger number of younger Jews, often through the pro-Marxist Bund or some Zionist groups, were sympathetic to [[Communism]] and Soviet Russia, both of which had been enemies of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. As a result of these factors they found it easy after 1939 to participate in the Soviet occupation administration in Eastern Poland, and briefly occupied prominent positions in industry, schools, local government, police and other Soviet-installed institutions.

However, the size of the Ghetto was only about 2.4% of the size of the city. The Germans closed off the Ghetto from the outside world, building a wall around it by 16 November 1940. During the next year and a half, Jews from smaller cities and villages were brought into the Warsaw Ghetto, while diseases (especially [[typhoid]]) and starvation kept the inhabitants at about the same number. Average food rations in 1941 for Jews in Warsaw were limited to 253 kcal, and 669 kcal for Poles, as opposed to 2,613 kcal for Germans.

About 50 ghetto fighters were saved by the Polish \"People's Guard\" and later formed their own partisan group, named after Anielewicz. Even after the end of the uprising there were still several hundreds of Jews who continued living in the ruined ghetto. Many of them survived thanks to the contacts they managed to establish with Poles outside the ghetto. The Uprising inspired Jews throughout Poland. Many Jewish leaders who survived the liquidation continued underground work outside the ghetto.

About 50,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding region were confined in a small area of Bia\u0142ystok. The ghetto had two sections, divided by the [[Bia\u0142a River (Supra\u015bl basin)|Biala River]]. Most Jews in the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto worked in forced-labor projects, primarily in large textile factories located within the ghetto boundaries. The Germans also sometimes used Jews in forced-labor projects outside the ghetto.\n\nIn February 1943, approximately 10,000 Bia\u0142ystok Jews were deported to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed too weak or sick to travel, were killed.\n\nIn August 1943, the Germans mounted an operation to destroy the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto. German forces and local police auxiliaries surrounded the ghetto and began to round up Jews systematically for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp. Approximately 7,600 Jews were held in a central transit camp in the city before deportation to Treblinka. Those deemed fit to work were sent to the [[Majdanek]] camp. In Majdanek, after another screening for ability to work, they were transported to the Poniatowa, Blizyn, or Auschwitz camps. Those deemed too weak to work were murdered at Majdanek. More than 1,000 Jewish children were sent first to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] ghetto in [[Bohemia]], and then to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], where they were killed.\n\nOn 15 August 1943, the [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising]] began, and several hundred Polish Jews and members of the [[Anti-Fascist Military Organisation]] ({{lang-pl|Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa}}) started an armed struggle against the German troops who were carrying out the planned liquidation and deportation of the ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ruch oporu w getcie bia\u0142ostockim.

At the same time there was an ongoing power struggle within the party itself and the antisemitic campaign was used by one faction against another. The so-called \"Partisan\" faction blamed the Jews who had held office during the Stalinist period for the excesses that had occurred, but the end result was that most of the remaining Polish Jews, regardless of their background or political affiliation, were targeted by the communist authorities.<ref>AP Online, \"Some Jewish exiles to have Polish citizenship restored this week\", 3 October 1998, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110812044919/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19804342.html]</ref>\n\nThere were several outcomes of the ''[[March 1968 events]]''.

Many historical issues, especially related to World War II and the 1944\u201389 period, suppressed by Communist censorship, have been re-evaluated and publicly discussed (like the Jedwabne pogrom, the [[Koniuchy massacre]], the [[Kielce pogrom]], the [[Auschwitz cross]], and Polish-Jewish wartime relations in general).\n[[File:Rabin Polski.jpg|thumb|upright|Chief Rabbi of Poland \u2013 [[Michael Schudrich]]]]\n\n[[File:Synagoga lesko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lesko Synagogue]], Poland]]\n[[File:Beit Warszawa synagogue interior2006.jpg|thumb|left|Reform [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue]]]]\n\nJewish religious life has been revived with the help of the [[Ronald Lauder Foundation]] and the [[Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture]]. There are two rabbis serving the Polish Jewish community, several Jewish schools and associated summer camps as well as several periodical and book series sponsored by the above foundations. Jewish studies programs are offered at major universities, such as [[Warsaw University]] and the [[Jagiellonian University]]. The [[Union of Jewish Religious Communities in Poland]] was founded in 1993. Its purpose is the promotion and organization of Jewish religious and cultural activities in Polish communities.\n\nA large number of cities with synagogues include Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], [[Tykocin]], [[Rzesz\u00f3w]], [[Kielce]], or [[G\u00f3ra Kalwaria]] although not many of them are still active in their original religious role. Stara Synagoga (\"Old Synagogue\") in Krak\u00f3w, which hosts a Jewish museum, was built in the early 15th century and is the oldest synagogue in Poland. Before the war, the Yeshiva Chachmei in Lublin was Europe's largest. In 2007 it was renovated, dedicated and reopened thanks to the efforts and endowments by Polish Jewry. Warsaw has an active synagogue, [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue|Beit Warszawa]], affiliated with the Liberal-Progressive stream of Judaism.\n\nThere are also several Jewish publications although most of them are in Polish. These include ''[[Midrasz]]'', ''Dos Jidische Wort'' (which is bilingual), as well as a youth journal ''Jidele'' and \"Sztendlach\" for young children. Active institutions include the Jewish Historical Institute, the E.R. Kaminska State Yiddish Theater in Warsaw, and the Jewish Cultural Center. The [[Judaica Foundation]] in Krak\u00f3w has sponsored a wide range of cultural and educational programs on Jewish themes for a predominantly Polish audience. With funds from the city of Warsaw and the Polish government ($26 million total) a [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] is being built in Warsaw.

At Treblinka there is a monument built out of many shards of broken stone, as well as a mausoluem dedicated to those who perished there. A small mound of human ashes commemorates the 350,000 victims of the Majdanek camp who were killed there by the Nazis.

It was constructed out of bronze and granite that the Nazis used for a monument honoring German victory over Poland and it was designed by [[Natan Rappaport]]. The Memorial is located where the Warsaw Ghetto used to be, at the site of one command bunker of the [[Jewish Combat Organization]].\n\nA memorial to the victims of the Kielce Pogrom of 1946, where a mob murdered more than 40 Jews who returned to the city after the Holocaust, was unveiled in 2006.

For centuries, [[Poland]] was home to the largest and most significant [[Jew]]ish community in the world. Poland was a principal center of [[Jewish culture]], thanks to a long period of statutory [[toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Qahal|social autonomy]] which ended with the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the 18th century. During [[World War II]] there was a nearly complete [[genocide|genocidal]] destruction of the Polish Jewish community by [[Nazi Germany]] and its collaborators, during the 1939\u20131945 [[German occupation of Poland]] and the ensuing [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Since the [[fall of communism in Poland]], there has been a renewed interest in Jewish culture, featuring an annual [[Jewish Culture Festival]], new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities, and [[Warsaw]]'s [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]].\n\nFrom the founding of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 through to the early years of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[Union of Lublin|created in 1569]], [[Poland]] was the most tolerant country in Europe.<ref name=\"Hugh\"/> Historians have used the label ''[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|paradisus iudaeorum]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"[[Paradise]] of the Jews\").<ref name=\"Engel2009\">Engel, David. \"On Reconciling the Histories of Two Chosen Peoples.\" The American Historical Review 114.4 (2009): 914-929.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polin.pl/en/wystawy-wystawa-glowna-galerie/paradisus-iudaeorum|title=Paradisus Iudaeorum (1569\u20131648)|website=POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews|date=13 May 2013}}</ref> The country became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world's largest Jewish community of the time.

Still, as Poland regained independence in the [[aftermath of World War I]], it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million. [[Antisemitism]] was a growing problem throughout Europe in those years, from both the political establishment and the general population.<ref name=\"Hagen-1\"/> Throughout the [[interwar period]], Poland supported Jewish emigration from Poland and, on the international arena, the creation of a Jewish state in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

For example, they could define their neighborhoods and economic competitors and set up monopolies.

Prominent among such rulers was [[Boles\u0142aw the Pious]] of [[Kalisz]], Prince of [[Great Poland]]. With the consent of the class representatives and higher officials, in 1264 he issued a General Charter of Jewish Liberties, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], which granted all Jews the freedom of worship, trade and travel. Similar privileges were granted to the Silesian Jews by the local princes, Prince Henry Probus of Wroc\u0142aw in 1273\u201390, Henry of Glogow in 1274 and 1299, Henry of Legnica in 1290 \u2013 95 and Bolko of Legnica and Wroc\u0142aw in 1295.<ref name=polishjews.org/> Article 31 of the Prince Boles\u0142aw of Kalisz's ''privilegium'' tried to rein in the Catholic Church from disseminating [[blood libel]]s against the Jews, by stating: \u201cAccusing Jews of drinking Christian blood is expressly prohibited.

Under his reign, streams of Jewish immigrants headed east to Poland and Jewish settlements are first mentioned as existing in [[Lviv|Lvov]] (1356), [[Sandomierz]] (1367), and [[Kazimierz]] near Krak\u00f3w (1386).<ref name=polishjews.org/> Casimir, who according to a legend had a Jewish lover named [[Esterka]] from [[Opoczno]]<ref name=\"opoczno-1\"/> was especially friendly to the Jews, and his reign is regarded as an era of great prosperity for Polish Jewry, and was nicknamed by his contemporaries \"King of the [[serf]]s and Jews.\" Under [[penalty of death]], he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced [[Christianity|Christian]] [[baptism]]. He inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of [[Jewish]] [[cemeteries]]. Nevertheless, while for the greater part of Casimir\u2019s reign the Jews of Poland enjoyed tranquility, toward its close they were subjected to persecution on account of the [[Black Death]].

In 1349 pogroms took place in many towns in Silesia.<ref name=polishjews.org/> There were accusations of [[blood libel]] by the priests, and new riots against the Jews in Pozna\u0144 in 1399. Accusations of blood libel by another fanatic priest led to the riots in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1407, although the royal guard hastened to the rescue.<ref name=\"Dubnow-3\"/> Hysteria caused by Black Death led to additional 14th-century outbreaks of violence against the Jews in [[Kalisz]], Krak\u00f3w and [[Bochnia]]. Traders and artisans jealous of Jewish prosperity, and fearing their rivalry, supported the harassment. In 1423 the statute of Warka forbade Jews the granting of loans against letters of credit or mortgage and limited their operations exclusively to loans made on security of moveable property.<ref name=polishjews.org/> In the 14th and 15th centuries rich Jewish merchants and moneylenders leased the royal mint, salt mines and the collecting of customs and tolls. The most famous of them were Jordan and his son Lewko of Krak\u00f3w in the 14th century and Jakub Slomkowicz of Luck, Wolczko of Drohobycz, Natko of Lvov, Samson of Zydaczow, Josko of Hrubieszow and Szania of Belz in the 15th century. For example, Wolczko of Drohobycz, King Ladislaus Jagiello's broker, was the owner of several villages in the Ruthenian voivodship and the soltys (administrator) of the village of Werbiz. Also Jews from Grodno were in this period owners of villages, manors, meadows, fish ponds and mills. However until the end of the 15th century agriculture as a source of income played only a minor role among Jewish families. More important were crafts for the needs of both their fellow Jews and the Christian population (fur making, tanning, tailoring).<ref name=polishjews.org/>\n[[File:Casimir IV Jagiellon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] confirmed and extended Jewish charters in the second half of the 15th century]]\n\nIn 1454 anti-Jewish riots flared up in [[Bohemia]]'s ethnically-German [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and other [[Silesia]]n cities, inspired by a Franciscan friar, [[John of Capistrano]], who accused Jews of profaning the Christian religion. As a result, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Zbigniew Olesnicki then invited John to conduct a similar campaign in Krak\u00f3w and several other cities, to lesser effect. In 1495, Jews were ordered out of the center of Krak\u00f3w and allowed to settle in the \"Jewish town\" of Kazimierz. In the same year, Alexander Jagiellon, following the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|1492 example of Spanish rulers]], banished the Jews from Lithuania.

Indeed, with the expulsion of the [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews from Spain]], Poland became the recognized haven for exiles from Western Europe; and the resulting accession to the ranks of Polish Jewry made it the cultural and spiritual center of the Jewish people.\n\nThe most prosperous period for Polish Jews began following this new influx of Jews with the reign of [[Sigismund I the Old]] (1506\u20131548), who protected the Jews in his realm. His son, [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1548\u20131572), mainly followed his father's tolerant policy and also granted communal-administration autonomy to the Jews and laid the foundation for the power of the ''[[Qahal]]'', or autonomous Jewish community. This period led to the creation of a proverb about Poland being a \"heaven for the Jews\". According to some sources, about three-quarters of all Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.<ref name=Sanford/><ref name=EJC/><ref name=\"relations\"/> In the middle of the 16th century, Poland welcomed the Jewish newcomers from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]], mostly of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] origin. Jewish religious life thrived in many Polish communities. In 1503, the Polish monarchy appointed Rabbi [[Jacob Pollak]], the official Rabbi of Poland, marking the emergence of the Chief Rabbinate. By 1551, Jews were given permission to choose their own Chief Rabbi. The Chief Rabbinate held power over law and finance, appointing judges and other officials. Some power was shared with local councils. The Polish government permitted the Rabbinate to grow in power, to use it for tax collection purposes. Only 30% of the money raised by the Rabbinate served Jewish causes, the rest went to the Crown for protection.

The Jewish community suffered greatly during the 1648 Ukrainian Cossack uprising which had been directed primarily against the Polish nobility and landlords. The Jews, perceived as allies of the Poles, were also victims of the revolt, during which about 20% of them were killed.\n\n[[File:Neu-er\u00f6ffnete Welt-Galleria Polnischer Jude.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Polish Jew in an engraving from 1703]]\n\nRuled by the elected kings of the [[House of Vasa]] since 1587, the embattled Commonwealth was invaded by the [[Swedish Empire]] in 1655 in what became known as [[Deluge (history)|the Deluge]]. The kingdom of Poland which had already suffered from the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] and from the recurring invasions of the Russians, [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], became the scene of even more atrocities. [[Charles X of Sweden]], at the head of his victorious army, overran the cities of Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw. The amount of destruction, pillage and methodical plunder during the [[Siege of Krak\u00f3w (1657)]] was so enormous that parts the city never again recovered.

Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. Although Jewish losses in those events were high, the Commonwealth lost one third of its population \u2014 approximately three million of its citizens.\n\nThe environment of the Polish Commonwealth, according to Hundert, profoundly affected Jews due to genuinely positive encounter with the Christian culture across the many cities and towns owned by the Polish aristocracy. There was no isolation.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} The Jewish dress resembled that of their Polish neighbor. \"Reports of romances, of drinking together in taverns, and of intellectual conversations are quite abundant.\" Wealthy Jews had Polish noblemen at their table, and served meals on silver plates.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} By 1764, there were about 750,000 Jews in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as ''Polania'' or ''Polin'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and as [[transliteration|transliterated]] into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as \"good omens\" because ''Polania'' can be broken down into three Hebrew words: ''po'' (\"here\"), ''lan'' (\"dwells\"), ''ya'' (\"[[Names of God in Judaism|God]]\"), and ''Polin'' into two words of: ''po'' (\"here\") ''lin'' (\"[you should] dwell\"). The \"message\" was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of [[Sigismund I the Old]] until the Nazi [[Holocaust]], Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Shemu\u2019el ha-Levi]] (Taz) that Poland was a place where \"most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel\" (''Divre David;'' 1689).<ref>[[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Samuel Ha-Levi]], \"Divre \u0304 David Ture \u0304 Zahav\" (1689) in Hebrew.

Quoted by the YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.</ref>\n\n===Jewish learning===\n[[File:Synagoga Zamo\u015b\u0107 VIII 2010.jpg|thumb|Late-[[Renaissance]] [[Zamo\u015b\u0107 Synagogue|synagogue]], [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], Poland, 1610\u201320]]\n''[[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]]'' were established, under the direction of the rabbis, in the more prominent communities. Such schools were officially known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], and their rabbi principals as [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. Important ''yeshivot'' existed in Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, and other cities. Jewish printing establishments came into existence in the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1530 a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Pentateuch]] ([[Torah]]) was printed in Krak\u00f3w; and at the end of the century the Jewish printing houses of that city and [[Lublin]] issued a large number of Jewish books, mainly of a religious character. The growth of [[Talmud|Talmudic scholarship]] in Poland was coincident with the greater prosperity of the Polish Jews; and because of their communal autonomy educational development was wholly one-sided and along Talmudic lines. Exceptions are recorded, however, where Jewish youth sought secular instruction in the European universities. The learned rabbis became not merely expounders of the Law, but also spiritual advisers, teachers, judges, and legislators; and their authority compelled the communal leaders to make themselves familiar with the abstruse questions of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Polish Jewry found its views of life shaped by the spirit of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, whose influence was felt in the home, in school, and in the synagogue.\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century the seeds of Talmudic learning had been transplanted to Poland from [[Bohemia]], particularly from the school of [[Jacob Pollak]], the creator of ''[[Pilpul]]'' (\"sharp reasoning\"). [[Shalom Shachna]] (c. 1500\u20131558), a pupil of Pollak, is counted among the pioneers of Talmudic learning in Poland. He lived and died in [[Lublin]], where he was the head of the ''yeshivah'' which produced the rabbinical celebrities of the following century. Shachna's son Israel became rabbi of Lublin on the death of his father, and Shachna's pupil [[Moses Isserles]] (known as the ''ReMA'') (1520\u20131572) achieved an international reputation among the Jews as the co-author of the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', (the \"Code of Jewish Law\"). His contemporary and correspondent [[Solomon Luria]] (1510\u20131573) of Lublin also enjoyed a wide reputation among his co-religionists; and the authority of both was recognized by the Jews throughout Europe. Heated religious disputations were common, and Jewish scholars participated in them. At the same time, the ''[[Kabbalah]]'' had become entrenched under the protection of [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinism]]; and such scholars as [[Mordecai Jaffe]] and [[Yoel Sirkis]] devoted themselves to its study. This period of great Rabbinical scholarship was interrupted by the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]].\n\n===The rise of Hasidism===\n[[File:Jakub Frank.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Frank]]]]\n{{main|Hasidic Judaism}}\nThe decade from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Cossacks' uprising]] until after the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish war]] (1648\u20131658) left a deep and lasting impression not only on the social life of the Polish-Lithuanian Jews, but on their spiritual life as well. The intellectual output of the Jews of Poland was reduced. The Talmudic learning which up to that period had been the common possession of the majority of the people became accessible to a limited number of students only. What religious study there was became overly formalized, some rabbis busied themselves with quibbles concerning religious laws; others wrote commentaries on different parts of the Talmud in which hair-splitting arguments were raised and discussed; and at times these arguments dealt with matters which were of no practical importance. At the same time, many miracle workers made their appearance among the Jews of Poland, culminating in a series of false \"Messianic\" movements, most famously as [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbatianism]] was succeeded by [[Jacob Frank|Frankism]].\n\nIn this time of [[mysticism]] and overly formal rabbinism came the teachings of [[Israel ben Eliezer]], known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'', or ''BeShT'', (1698\u20131760), which had a profound effect on the Jews of [[Eastern Europe]] and Poland in particular. His disciples taught and encouraged the new fervent brand of [[Judaism]] based on ''[[Kabbalah]]'' known as [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. The rise of Hasidic Judaism within Poland's borders and beyond had a great influence on the rise of [[Haredi Judaism]] all over the world, with a continuous influence through its many [[List of Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic dynasties]] including those of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander]], [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]], [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]], among others.\n\n==The Partitions of Poland==\n[[File:Jewish dress in Poland 17th and 18th century.jpg|thumb|upright|Jewish dress in 17th ''(top)'' and 18th centuries]]\nIn 1742 most of Silesia was lost to [[Prussia]]. Further disorder and anarchy reigned supreme in Poland during the second half of the 18th century, from the accession to the throne of its last king, [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski]] in 1764.

The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous ''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]]'' (\"Commission of National Education\"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One of the members of the commission, ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[Andrzej Zamoyski]], along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some ''szlachta'' and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the [[French Revolution]] of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.\n[[File:Berek joselewicz.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Berek Joselewicz]] (1764\u20131809)]]\nA second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] was made on 17 July 1793. Jews, in a Jewish regiment led by [[Berek Joselewicz]], took part in the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] the following year, when the Poles tried to again achieve independence, but were brutally put down. Following the revolt, the third and final partition of Poland took place in 1795. The territories which included the great bulk of the Jewish population was transferred to Russia, and thus they became subjects of that empire, although in the first half of the 19th century some semblance of a vastly smaller Polish state was preserved, especially in the form of the [[Congress Poland]] (1815\u20131831).\n\nUnder foreign rule many Jews inhabiting formerly Polish lands were indifferent to Polish aspirations for independence.

The lands that had once been Poland were to remain the home of many Jews, as, in 1772, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], the ''Tzarina'' of Russia, instituted the [[Pale of Settlement]], restricting Jews to the western parts of the empire, which would eventually include much of Poland, although it excluded some areas in which Jews had previously lived. By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live in the Pale.\n\nTsarist policy towards the Jews of Poland alternated between harsh rules, and inducements meant to break the resistance to large-scale conversion.

The Polish Jews were allowed to establish schools with Russian, German or Polish curricula. They could own land in the territories annexed from Poland. However, they were also restricted from leasing property, teaching in Yiddish, and from entering Russia. They were banned from the [[brewing industry]]. The harshest measures designed to compel Jews to merge into society at large called for their expulsion from small villages, forcing them to move into towns. Once the resettlement began, thousands of Jews lost their only source of income and turned to [[Qahal]] for support. Their living conditions in [[Pale of Settlement|the Pale]] began to dramatically worsen.<ref name=\"Alexander_I\"/>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicolas I]], known by the Jews as \"[[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the Second\", hundreds of new anti-Jewish measures were enacted.<ref name=\"Nicholas_I\"/> The 1827 decree by Nicolas \u2013 while lifting the traditional double taxation on Jews in lieu of army service \u2013 made Jews subject to general military recruitment laws that required Jewish communities to provide 7 recruits per each 1000 \"souls\" every 4 years. Unlike the general population that had to provide recruits between the ages of 18 and 35, Jews had to provide recruits between the ages of 12 and 25, at the [[qahal]]'s discretion.

It extended from the eastern ''pale'', or demarcation line, to the western Russian border with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]) and with [[Austria-Hungary]].\nThe archaic English term ''pale'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[:wikt:palus#Latin|palus]]}}, a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.\n\nWith its large Catholic and Jewish populations, the Pale was acquired by the Russian Empire (which was a majority [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]) in a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers between 1791 and 1835, and lasted until the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917. It comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and mostly corresponded to historical borders of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; it covered much of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of western [[Russia]].\n\nFrom 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]]. At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]], excluded from residency at a number of cities within the Pale. Settlers from  outside the pale were forced to move to small towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s''.\n\nAlthough the Jews were accorded slightly more rights with the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], they were still restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and subject to restrictions on ownership and profession.

Champions of ''Haskalah'', the ''[[Haskalah|Maskilim]]'', pushed for assimilation and integration into Russian culture. At the same time, there was another school of Jewish thought that emphasized traditional study and a Jewish response to the ethical problems of antisemitism and persecution, one form of which was the [[Musar movement]]. Polish Jews generally were less influenced by ''Haskalah'', rather focusing on a strong continuation of their religious lives based on [[Halakha]] (\"rabbis's law\") following primarily [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Hasidic Judaism]], and also adapting to the new [[Religious Zionism]] of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement later in the 19th century.\n\n===Politics in Polish territory===\n[[File:ac.manif1917.jpg|thumb|A [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]ist demonstration, 1917]]\nBy the late 19th century, ''Haskalah'' and the debates it caused created a growing number of political movements within the Jewish community itself, covering a wide range of views and vying for votes in local and regional elections. Zionism became very popular with the advent of the ''[[Poale Zion]]'' socialist party as well as the religious [[Polish Mizrahi]], and the increasingly popular [[General Zionists]]. Jews also took up [[socialism]], forming the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] [[labor union]] which supported assimilation and the [[rights of labor]]. The [[Folkspartei]] (People's Party) advocated, for its part, cultural autonomy and resistance to assimilation. In 1912, ''[[Agudat Israel]]'', a religious party, came into existence.\n\nMany Jews took part in the Polish insurrections, particularly against Russia (since the Tsars discriminated heavily against the Jews). The [[Ko\u015bciuszko Insurrection]] (1794), [[November Insurrection]] (1830\u201331), [[January Insurrection]] (1863) and [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolutionary Movement of 1905]] all saw significant Jewish involvement in the cause of Polish independence.\n\nDuring the [[Second Polish Republic]] period, there were several prominent Jewish politicians in the Polish Sejm, such as [[Apolinary Hartglas]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]]. Many Jewish political parties were active, representing a wide ideological spectrum, from the Zionists, to the socialists to the anti-Zionists. One of the largest of these parties was the Bund, which was strongest in Warsaw and Lodz.\n\nIn addition to the socialists, Zionist parties were also popular, in particular, the Marxist [[Poale Zion]] and the orthodox religious Polish Mizrahi. The [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] party became the most prominent Jewish party in the interwar period and in the 1919 elections to the [[Polish legislative election, 1919|first Polish Sejm]] since the partitions, gained 50% of the Jewish vote.\n\nIn 1914, the German Zionist [[Max Bodenheimer]] founded the short-lived [[German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews]], with the goal of establishing a buffer state (''Pufferstaat'') within the Jewish Pale of Settlement, composed of the [[Partitions of Poland|former Polish provinces annexed by Russia]], being ''de facto'' [[protectorate]] of the [[German Empire]] that would free Jews in the region from Russian oppression. The plan, known as the [[League of East European States]], soon proved unpopular with both German officials and Bodenheimer's colleagues, and was dead by the following year.<ref>[[Walter Laqueur]].

Some scholars note that while not pro-Communist, many Jews saw the Soviets as the lesser threat compared to the German Nazis. They stress that stories of Jews welcoming the Soviets on the streets, vividly remembered by many Poles from the [[Kresy|eastern part of the country]] are impressionistic and not reliable indicators of the level of Jewish support for the Soviets. Additionally, it has been noted that some ethnic Poles were as prominent as Jews in filling civil and police positions in the occupation administration, and that Jews, both civilians and in the Polish military, suffered equally at the hands of the Soviet occupiers.<ref>Samuel D.

A larger number of younger Jews, often through the pro-Marxist Bund or some Zionist groups, were sympathetic to [[Communism]] and Soviet Russia, both of which had been enemies of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. As a result of these factors they found it easy after 1939 to participate in the Soviet occupation administration in Eastern Poland, and briefly occupied prominent positions in industry, schools, local government, police and other Soviet-installed institutions.

Initially, almost 140,000 Jews were moved into the ghetto from all parts of Warsaw. At the same time approximately 110,000 Poles had been forcibly evicted from the area.

However, the size of the Ghetto was only about 2.4% of the size of the city. The Germans closed off the Ghetto from the outside world, building a wall around it by 16 November 1940. During the next year and a half, Jews from smaller cities and villages were brought into the Warsaw Ghetto, while diseases (especially [[typhoid]]) and starvation kept the inhabitants at about the same number. Average food rations in 1941 for Jews in Warsaw were limited to 253 kcal, and 669 kcal for Poles, as opposed to 2,613 kcal for Germans. On 22 July 1942, [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|the mass deportation]] of the Warsaw Ghetto inhabitants began.{{sfn|Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs|2014|pp=10\u201314}} During the next fifty-two days (until 12 September 1942) about 300,000 people were transported by freight train to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].

The German forces, which included 2,842 Nazi soldiers and 7,000 security personnel, were not capable of crushing the Jewish resistance in open street combat and after several days, decided to switch strategy by setting buildings on fire in which the Jewish fighters hid. The commander of the \u017bOB, [[Mordechai Anielewicz]], died fighting on 8 May 1943 at the organization's command centre on 18 Mila Street.\n[[File:Gesiowka commemorative plaque at 34 Anielewicza Street.JPG|thumb|left|34 [[Mordechaj Anielewicz]] Street, Warsaw, Poland]]\n\nIt took the Germans twenty-seven days to put down the uprising, after some very heavy fighting. The German general [[J\u00fcrgen Stroop]] in his report stated that his troops had killed 6,065 Jewish fighters during the battle. After the uprising was already over, [[Heinrich Himmler]] had the Great Synagogue on T\u0142omackie Square (outside the ghetto) destroyed as a celebration of German victory and a symbol that the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw was no longer.\n\nA group of fighters escaped from the ghetto through the sewers and reached the Lomianki forest. About 50 ghetto fighters were saved by the Polish \"People's Guard\" and later formed their own partisan group, named after Anielewicz. Even after the end of the uprising there were still several hundreds of Jews who continued living in the ruined ghetto. Many of them survived thanks to the contacts they managed to establish with Poles outside the ghetto. The Uprising inspired Jews throughout Poland. Many Jewish leaders who survived the liquidation continued underground work outside the ghetto. They hid other Jews, forged necessary documents and were active in the [[Polish underground]] in other parts of Warsaw and surrounding area.\n[[File:Gesiowka.jpg|thumb|right|Freed prisoners of [[G\u0119si\u00f3wka]] and the ''[[Szare Szeregi]]'' fighters after the liberation of the camp in August 1944]]\n\nWarsaw Ghetto Uprising, was followed by other [[Ghetto uprising]]s in many smaller towns and cities across German occupied Poland.

With the decision of [[Nazi Germany]] to begin the [[Final Solution]], the destruction of the Jews of Europe, [[Aktion Reinhard]] began in 1942, with the opening of the extermination camps of Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka, followed by Auschwitz-Birkenau where people were killed in gas chambers and mass executions (death wall).<ref name=\"Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp - Advice from a Tour Guide\"/> Many died from hunger, starvation, disease, torture or by pseudo-medical experiments. The mass deportation of Jews from ghettos to these camps, such as happened at the Warsaw Ghetto, soon followed, and more than 1.7 million Jews were killed at the Aktion Reinhard camps by October 1943 alone.\n\n====The Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto and its uprising====\n{{main|Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto}}\n{{further|Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising}}\nIn August 1941, the Germans ordered the establishment of a [[ghetto]] in Bia\u0142ystok. About 50,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding region were confined in a small area of Bia\u0142ystok. The ghetto had two sections, divided by the [[Bia\u0142a River (Supra\u015bl basin)|Biala River]]. Most Jews in the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto worked in forced-labor projects, primarily in large textile factories located within the ghetto boundaries. The Germans also sometimes used Jews in forced-labor projects outside the ghetto.\n\nIn February 1943, approximately 10,000 Bia\u0142ystok Jews were deported to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed too weak or sick to travel, were killed.\n\nIn August 1943, the Germans mounted an operation to destroy the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto. German forces and local police auxiliaries surrounded the ghetto and began to round up Jews systematically for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp. Approximately 7,600 Jews were held in a central transit camp in the city before deportation to Treblinka. Those deemed fit to work were sent to the [[Majdanek]] camp. In Majdanek, after another screening for ability to work, they were transported to the Poniatowa, Blizyn, or Auschwitz camps. Those deemed too weak to work were murdered at Majdanek. More than 1,000 Jewish children were sent first to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] ghetto in [[Bohemia]], and then to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], where they were killed.\n\nOn 15 August 1943, the [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising]] began, and several hundred Polish Jews and members of the [[Anti-Fascist Military Organisation]] ({{lang-pl|Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa}}) started an armed struggle against the German troops who were carrying out the planned liquidation and deportation of the ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ruch oporu w getcie bia\u0142ostockim.

The fighting in isolated pockets of resistance lasted for several days, but the defence was broken almost instantly. As with the earlier [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of April 1943, the Bia\u0142ystok uprising had no chances for military success, but it was the second largest [[ghetto uprising]], after the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]].

However, the campaign did not resonate well with the Polish public, as most Poles saw similarities between Israel's fight for survival and Poland's past struggles for independence.

At the same time there was an ongoing power struggle within the party itself and the antisemitic campaign was used by one faction against another.

Many historical issues, especially related to World War II and the 1944\u201389 period, suppressed by Communist censorship, have been re-evaluated and publicly discussed (like the Jedwabne pogrom, the [[Koniuchy massacre]], the [[Kielce pogrom]], the [[Auschwitz cross]], and Polish-Jewish wartime relations in general).\n[[File:Rabin Polski.jpg|thumb|upright|Chief Rabbi of Poland \u2013 [[Michael Schudrich]]]]\n\n[[File:Synagoga lesko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lesko Synagogue]], Poland]]\n[[File:Beit Warszawa synagogue interior2006.jpg|thumb|left|Reform [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue]]]]\n\nJewish religious life has been revived with the help of the [[Ronald Lauder Foundation]] and the [[Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture]]. There are two rabbis serving the Polish Jewish community, several Jewish schools and associated summer camps as well as several periodical and book series sponsored by the above foundations. Jewish studies programs are offered at major universities, such as [[Warsaw University]] and the [[Jagiellonian University]]. The [[Union of Jewish Religious Communities in Poland]] was founded in 1993. Its purpose is the promotion and organization of Jewish religious and cultural activities in Polish communities.\n\nA large number of cities with synagogues include Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], [[Tykocin]], [[Rzesz\u00f3w]], [[Kielce]], or [[G\u00f3ra Kalwaria]] although not many of them are still active in their original religious role. Stara Synagoga (\"Old Synagogue\") in Krak\u00f3w, which hosts a Jewish museum, was built in the early 15th century and is the oldest synagogue in Poland. Before the war, the Yeshiva Chachmei in Lublin was Europe's largest. In 2007 it was renovated, dedicated and reopened thanks to the efforts and endowments by Polish Jewry. Warsaw has an active synagogue, [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue|Beit Warszawa]], affiliated with the Liberal-Progressive stream of Judaism.\n\nThere are also several Jewish publications although most of them are in Polish. These include ''[[Midrasz]]'', ''Dos Jidische Wort'' (which is bilingual), as well as a youth journal ''Jidele'' and \"Sztendlach\" for young children. Active institutions include the Jewish Historical Institute, the E.R. Kaminska State Yiddish Theater in Warsaw, and the Jewish Cultural Center. The [[Judaica Foundation]] in Krak\u00f3w has sponsored a wide range of cultural and educational programs on Jewish themes for a predominantly Polish audience. With funds from the city of Warsaw and the Polish government ($26 million total) a [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] is being built in Warsaw.

At Auschwitz the O\u015bwi\u0119cim State Museum currently houses exhibitions on Nazi crimes with a special section (Block Number 27) specifically focused on Jewish victims and martyrs. At Treblinka there is a monument built out of many shards of broken stone, as well as a mausoluem dedicated to those who perished there. A small mound of human ashes commemorates the 350,000 victims of the Majdanek camp who were killed there by the Nazis. [[Jewish Cemetery, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] is one of the largest Jewish burial grounds in Europe, and preserved historic sites include those located in G\u00f3ra Kalwaria and [[Le\u017cajsk]] ([[Elimelech of Lizhensk|Elimelech's of Lizhensk]] [[ohel (grave)|ohel]]).<ref name=\"JVL\"/>\n\nThe Great Synagogue in [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] was excavated after testimony by a Holocaust survivor suggested that many Jewish relics and ritual objects had been buried there, just before Nazis took over the town.

It was constructed out of bronze and granite that the Nazis used for a monument honoring German victory over Poland and it was designed by [[Natan Rappaport]]. The Memorial is located where the Warsaw Ghetto used to be, at the site of one command bunker of the [[Jewish Combat Organization]].\n\nA memorial to the victims of the Kielce Pogrom of 1946, where a mob murdered more than 40 Jews who returned to the city after the Holocaust, was unveiled in 2006. The funds for the memorial came from the city itself and from the [[U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad]].\n\nPolish authors and scholars have published many works about history of Jews in Poland.

FtsZ is a [[prokaryotic]] [[Homology (biology)|homologue]] of the [[eukaryotic]] protein [[tubulin]]. The initials FtsZ mean \"'''F'''ilamenting  '''t'''emperature-'''s'''ensitive mutant '''Z'''\". The hypothesis was that cell division mutants of ''[[E. coli]]'' would grow as [[filamentation|filaments]] due to the inability of the daughter cells to separate from one another. FtsZ is found in almost all bacteria, many archaea, all chloroplasts and some mitochondria, where it is essential for cell division. FtsZ assembles the cytoskeletal scaffold of the Z ring that, along with additional proteins, constricts to divide the cell in two. \n\n== History ==\nIn the 1960s scientists screened for temperature sensitive mutations that blocked cell division at 42\u00b0 C. The mutant cells divided normally at 30\u00b0, but failed to divide at 42\u00b0. Continued growth without division produced long filamentous cells ('''F'''ilamenting '''t'''emperature '''s'''ensitive). Several such mutants were discovered and mapped to a locus originally named ''ftsA,'' which could be one or more genes''.''

Mutants defective in GTPase activity often still divide, but sometimes form twisted and disordered septa.  It is unclear as to whether FtsZ actually provides the physical force that results in division or serves as a marker for other proteins to execute division.\n\nIf FtsZ does provide force that divides the cell, it may do so through the relative movement of subunits. Computer models and ''in vivo'' measurements suggest that single FtsZ filaments cannot sustain a length more than 30 subunits long. In this model, FtsZ scission force comes from the relative lateral movement of subunits.<ref name=\"pmid19116281\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lan G, Daniels BR, Dobrowsky TM, Wirtz D, Sun SX | title = Condensation of FtsZ filaments can drive bacterial cell division | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 121\u20136 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19116281 | pmc = 2629247 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0807963106 }}</ref> Lines of FtsZ would line up together parallel and pull on each other creating a \"cord\" of many strings that tightens itself.\n\nIn other models, FtsZ does not provide the contractile force but provides the cell a spatial scaffold for other proteins to execute the division of the cell. This is akin to the creating of a temporary structure by construction workers to access hard-to-reach places of a building. The temporary structure allows unfettered access and ensures that the workers can reach all places. If the temporary structure is not correctly built, the workers will not be able to reach certain places, and the building will be deficient.\n\nThe scaffold theory is supported by information that shows that the formation of the ring and localization to the membrane requires the concerted action of a number of accessory proteins.

The origin of the [[cytokinesis|cytokinetic]] force, thus, remains unclear, but it is believed that the localized synthesis of new cell wall produces at least part of this force.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors = Coltharp C, Buss J, Plumer TM, Xiao, J |display-authors = 4 | title = Defining the rate-limiting processes of bacterial cytokinesis | journal = PNAS | volume = 113 | issue = 8 | pages = e1044-e1053 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26831086 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1514296113 }}</ref>   In liposomes Osawa (2009) showed FtsZ is capable of exerting a contractile force with no other proteins present.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Osawa M, Anderson DE, Erickson HP | title = Reconstitution of contractile FtsZ rings in liposomes | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5877 | pages = 792\u20134 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18420899 | pmc = 2645864 | doi = 10.1126/science.1154520 }}</ref>\n\nErickson (2009) proposed how the roles of tubulin-like proteins and actin-like proteins in cell division became reversed in an evolutionary mystery.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Erickson HP | title = Evolution of the cytoskeleton | journal = BioEssays | volume = 29 | issue = 7 | pages = 668\u201377 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17563102 | pmc = 2630885 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20601 }}</ref>\nThe use of the FtsZ ring in dividing [[chloroplast]]s and some [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] further establishes their prokaryotic ancestry.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leger MM, Petr\u016f M, \u017d\u00e1rsk\u00fd V, Eme L, Vl\u010dek \u010c, Harding T, Lang BF, Eli\u00e1\u0161 M, Dole\u017eal P, Roger AJ | display-authors = 6 | title = An ancestral bacterial division system is widespread in eukaryotic mitochondria | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 33 | pages = 10239\u201346 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25831547 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1421392112 | pmc = 4547283 }}</ref> [[L-form bacteria]] that lack a [[cell wall]] do not require FtsZ for division, which implies that bacteria may have retained components of an ancestral mode of cell division.<ref name=\"pmid123455\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leaver M, Dom\u00ednguez-Cuevas P, Coxhead JM, Daniel RA, Errington J | title = Life without a wall or division machine in Bacillus subtilis | journal = Nature | volume = 457 | issue = 7231 | pages = 849\u201353 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19212404 | doi = 10.1038/nature07742 }}</ref>\n\nMuch is known about the dynamic polymerization activities of [[tubulin]] and [[microtubules]], but little is known about these activities in FtsZ.  While it is known that single-stranded [[tubulin]] protofilaments form into 13 stranded [[microtubules]], the multistranded structure of the FtsZ-containing Z-ring is not known. It is only speculated that the structure consists of overlapping protofilaments.  Nevertheless, recent work with purified FtsZ on supported lipid bilayers as well as imaging FtsZ in living bacterial cells  revealed that FtsZ protofilaments have polarity and move in one direction by [[treadmilling]] <ref name=\"pmid24316672\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Loose M, Mitchison TJ | title = The bacterial cell division proteins FtsA and FtsZ self-organize into dynamic cytoskeletal patterns | journal = Nature Cell Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 38\u201346 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24316672 | pmc = 4019675 | doi = 10.1038/ncb2885 }}</ref>(see also below).\n\nRecently, proteins similar to tubulin and FtsZ have been discovered in large plasmids found in ''Bacillus'' species. They are believed to function as components of [[segrosome]]s, which are multiprotein complexes that partition chromosomes/plasmids in bacteria. The plasmid homologs of tubulin/FtsZ seem to have conserved the ability to polymerize into filaments.\n\n=== The contractile ring ===\n[[File:FtsZ Filaments.svg|thumb|right|The Z-ring forms from smaller subunits of FtsZ filaments. These filaments may pull on each other and tighten to divide the cell.]]\n[[File:Zrings.png|thumb|upright|right|[[Super-resolution imaging|Super-resolution]] image of Z-rings (green) at different stages of constriction in two ''E. coli'' cells.]]\nFtsZ has the ability to bind to [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] and also exhibits a [[GTPase]] domain that allows it to hydrolyze GTP to GDP and a phosphate group. ''In vivo'', FtsZ forms filaments with a repeating arrangement of subunits, all arranged head-to-tail.<ref name=\"pmid9442869\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Desai A, Mitchison TJ | title = Microtubule polymerization dynamics | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 13 | pages = 83\u2013117 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9442869 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.13.1.83 }}</ref> These filaments form a ring around the longitudinal midpoint, or septum, of the cell. This ring is called the Z-ring.\n\nThe GTP hydrolyzing activity of the protein is not essential to the formation of filaments or cell division. Mutants defective in GTPase activity often still divide, but sometimes form twisted and disordered septa.  It is unclear as to whether FtsZ actually provides the physical force that results in division or serves as a marker for other proteins to execute division.\n\nIf FtsZ does provide force that divides the cell, it may do so through the relative movement of subunits. Computer models and ''in vivo'' measurements suggest that single FtsZ filaments cannot sustain a length more than 30 subunits long. In this model, FtsZ scission force comes from the relative lateral movement of subunits.<ref name=\"pmid19116281\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lan G, Daniels BR, Dobrowsky TM, Wirtz D, Sun SX | title = Condensation of FtsZ filaments can drive bacterial cell division | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 121\u20136 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19116281 | pmc = 2629247 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0807963106 }}</ref> Lines of FtsZ would line up together parallel and pull on each other creating a \"cord\" of many strings that tightens itself.\n\nIn other models, FtsZ does not provide the contractile force but provides the cell a spatial scaffold for other proteins to execute the division of the cell. This is akin to the creating of a temporary structure by construction workers to access hard-to-reach places of a building. The temporary structure allows unfettered access and ensures that the workers can reach all places. If the temporary structure is not correctly built, the workers will not be able to reach certain places, and the building will be deficient.\n\nThe scaffold theory is supported by information that shows that the formation of the ring and localization to the membrane requires the concerted action of a number of accessory proteins. ZipA or the actin homologue [[FtsA]] permit initial FtsZ localization to the membrane.<ref name=\"pmid15752196\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pichoff S, Lutkenhaus J | title = Tethering the Z ring to the membrane through a conserved membrane targeting sequence in FtsA | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 1722\u201334 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15752196 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04522.x }}</ref>  Following localization to the membrane, division proteins of the Fts family are recruited for ring assembly.<ref name=\"pmid12457697\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Buddelmeijer N, Beckwith J | title = Assembly of cell division proteins at the ''E. coli'' cell center | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 553\u20137 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12457697 | doi = 10.1016/S1369-5274(02)00374-0 }}</ref> Many of these proteins, such as FtsW, FtsK, and FtsQ are involved in stabilization of the Z ring and may also be active participants in the scission event.

This type of regulation seems to occur in other species such as ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' and ''[[Caulobacter crescentus]]''.  However, other species including ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Myxococcus xanthus]]'' seem to use positive regulators that stimulate FtsZ assembly at mid-cell.<ref name=\"pmid26029202\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rowlett VW, Margolin W | title = The Min system and other nucleoid-independent regulators of Z ring positioning | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 6 | issue =  | pages = 478 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26029202 | pmc = 4429545 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2015.00478 }}</ref>\n\n=== Communicating distress ===\n\nFtsZ polymerization is also linked to stressors like [[DNA damage]].

Noc [[gene knockout]]s result in cells that divide without respect to the [[nucleoid]] region, resulting in its asymmetrical partitioning between the daughter cells.
