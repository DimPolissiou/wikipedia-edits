[[Saint Michael (Roman Catholic)|Archangels Michael]] and [[Archangel Gabriel|Gabriel]] are also depicted.]]\n\nThe [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] has been one of the major subjects of [[Western Art]] for centuries. Numerous pieces of '''Marian art in the Catholic Church''' covering a range of topics have been produced, from masters such as [[Michelangelo]] and [[Botticelli]] to works made by unknown peasant artisans.<ref>Timothy Verdon, 2006, ''Mary in Western Art'' {{ISBN|978-0-9712981-9-4}}</ref>\n\nMarian art forms part of the fabric of Roman Catholic Marian culture through their emotional impact on the veneration of the Blessed Virgin. Images such as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] and the many artistic renditions of it as statues are not simply works of art but are a central elements of the daily lives of the Mexican people.<ref name= Meade /> Both [[Miguel Hidalgo|Hidalgo]] and [[Emiliano Zapata|Zapata]] flew Guadalupan flags and depictions of the Virgin of Guadalupe continue to remain a key unifying element in the Mexican nation.<ref name=Maxwell >''The Virgin of Guadalupe'' by Maxwell E.

Other influences on Marian art have been the [[Feast day]]s of the Church, [[Marian apparition]]s, [[Mariology of the saints|writings of the saints]] and popular devotions such as the [[rosary]], the [[Stations of the Cross]], or total consecration, and also [[Mariology of the popes|papal initiatives]], and [[Marian papal encyclicals and Apostolic Letters]].\n\nEach of these fundamental Mariological beliefs has given rise to Roman Catholic Marian art that has become part of Mariology, by emphasizing Marian veneration, being celebrated in specific Marian feasts, or becoming part of key Roman Catholic Marian churches. This article's focus is primarily on how the artistic component of Roman Catholic Mariology has represented the fundamental [[Marian doctrines of the Catholic Church]], and has thus interacted with them, creating a force that has shaped Catholic Mariology over the centuries.\n\n{{RC-Mariology}}\n\n==Blending of art, theology and spirituality==\n{{see also2|[[Marian devotions]]|[[Silent preaching]]|[[Rosary devotions and spirituality|Rosary devotions]]}}\n[[File:Virgin salus populi romani.jpg|right|thumb|[[Salus Populi Romani]], a popular icon in Rome.]]\n\nArt has been an integral element of the Catholic identity since the very beginning.<ref name=Donovan >''Distinctively Catholic: an exploration of Catholic identity'' by Daniel Donovan 1997 {{ISBN|0-8091-3750-X}} pp. 96\u201398</ref> Medieval Catholicism cherished relics and pilgrimages to visit them were common. Churches and specific works of art were commissioned to honor the saints and the Virgin Mary has always been seen as the most powerful intercessor among all saints\u2014her depictions being the subject of veneration among Catholics worldwide.<ref name=Donovan />\n\n[[Roman Catholic Mariology]] does not simply consist of a set of theological writings, but also relies on the emotional impact of art, music and architecture. [[Roman Catholic Marian music|Marian music]] and [[Roman Catholic Marian churches|Marian shrines]] interact with Marian art as key components of Mariology, e.g. the construction of major Marian churches gives rise to major pieces of art for the decoration of the church.<ref>Janusz Rosikon, 2001, ''The Madonnas of Europe: Pilgrimages to the Great Marian Shrines'' {{ISBN|978-0-89870-849-3}}</ref><ref>Edel 2006, ''Madonna: Sacred Art And Holy Music'' {{ISBN|9783937406404}}</ref><ref>University of Dayton Marian Music https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php</ref><ref>Peter Mullen ''Shrines of Our Lady'' {{ISBN|978-0-312-19503-8}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, [[Gabriele Paleotti]]'s ''Discourse on Sacred and Profane Images'' became known as the \"Catechism of images\" for Catholics, given that it established key concepts for the use of images as a form of religious instruction and indoctrination via [[silent preaching]] (''muta predicatio'').<ref name=Mitchell >''The Mystery of the Rosary: Marian Devotion and the Reinvention of Catholicism'' by Nathan Mitchell 2009 {{ISBN|0-8147-9591-9}} pp. 37\u201342</ref><ref name=Barber >''The road from Eden: studies in Christianity and culture'' by John Barber 2008 {{ISBN|1-933146-34-6}} p. 288</ref> Paleotti's approach was implemented by his powerful contemporary Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] and his focus on \"the transformation of Christian life through vision\" and the \"nonverbal [[rules of language]]\" shaped the Catholic reinterpretations of the Virgin Mary in the 16th and 17th centuries and fostered and promoted Marian devotions such as the Rosary.<ref name=Mitchell /><ref name=Barber />\n\nAn example of the interaction of Marian art, culture and churches is [[Salus Populi Romani]], a key Marian icon in Rome at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], the earliest Marian church in Rome. The practice of crowning the images of Mary started at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome by Pope [[Clement VIII]] in the 17th century.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07664a.htm Catholic encyclopedia]</ref> In 1899 Eugenio Pacelli (later [[Pope Pius XII]]) said his first Holy Mass in front of it at the [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. Fifty years later, he physically crowned this picture as part of the first Marian year in Church history, as he proclaimed the [[Queenship of Mary]]. The image was carried from Santa Maria Maggiore around Rome as part of the celebration of the Marian year and the proclamation of the Queenship of Mary.\n\nAnother example is [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]]. Catholics have, for centuries, prayed before this icon, usually in reproductions, to intercede on their behalf to Christ.<ref>Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} pp. 431\u2013433</ref> Over the centuries, several churches dedicated to Our Mother of Perpetual Help have been constructed. Pope [[John Paul II]] held mass at the [[National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help]] in the Philippines where the devotion is very popular and many Catholic churches hold a Novena and Mass honoring it every Wednesday using a replica of the icon, which is also widely displayed in houses, buses and public transport in the Philippines.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1981/february/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19810217_manila-baclaran_en.html Vatican website: Pope John Paul II in the Philippines]</ref><ref>''Culture and customs of the Philippines'' by Paul A.

This illustrates how a medieval work of art can give rise to feast days, Cathedrals and Marian music.\n\n[[File:Ostrabrama-prayer.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Praying to ''[[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]]'' in [[Lithuania]].]]\nThe use of Marian art by Catholics worldwide accompanies specific forms of [[Marian devotion]] and spirituality. The widespread Catholic use of replicas of the statue of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] emphasizes devotions to the [[Immaculate Conception]] and the [[Rosary]], both reported in the Lourdes messages. To Catholics, the distinctive blue and white Lourdes statues are reminders of the emphasis of Lourdes on [[Rosary devotions and spirituality|Rosary devotions]] and the millions of pilgrimages to the [[Rosary Basilica]] at Lourdes shows how Churches, devotions and art intertwine within Catholic culture. The Rosary remains the prayer of choice among Catholics who visit Lourdes or venerate the Lourdes statues worldwide.<ref>''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 {{ISBN|90-04-12654-6}} p. 339</ref><ref>''Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac'' by Matthew Bunson 2008 {{ISBN|1-59276-441-X}} p. 123</ref><ref>''The Mystery of the Rosary'' by Nathan Mitchell 2009 {{ISBN|0-8147-9591-9}} p. 193</ref><ref>''China's Catholics'' by Richard Madsen 1998 {{ISBN|0-520-21326-2}} pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nHistorically, Marian art has not only impacted the image of Mary among Catholics, but that of Jesus. The early \"[[Kyrios]] image\" of Jesus as \"the Lord and Master\" was specially emphasized in the [[Pauline Epistles]].<ref name =mercer >''Mercer dictionary of the Bible'' by Watson E.

Brooke 2006 {{ISBN|0-521-78291-0}} pp. 183\u2013184</ref> The emphasis on the humility of Jesus and the poverty of his birth depicted in Nativity art reinforced the image of God not as severe and punishing, but himself humble at birth and sacrificed at death.<ref name=Raab >''The tradition of Catholic prayer'' by Christian Raab, Harry Hagan, St. Meinrad Archabbey 2007 {{ISBN|0-8146-3184-3}} pp. 86\u201387</ref> As the tender joys of the Nativity were added to the agony of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] (as depicted in scenes such as [[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]]) a whole new range of approved religious emotions were ushered in via Marian art, with wide-ranging cultural impacts for centuries thereafter.<ref name=GFinger >''The vitality of the Christian tradition'' by George Finger Thomas 1944 {{ISBN|0-8369-2378-2}} pp. 110\u2013112</ref><ref>''La vida sacra: contemporary Hispanic sacramental theology'' by James L.

In the 12th century [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]] in France used the motif of the ''protective mantle'' of the Virgin Mary which shielded the kneeling abbots and abbesses. In the 13th century [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] was also aware of this motif, which eventually led to the iconography of the [[Virgin of Mercy]] and an increased focused on the concept of Marian protection.<ref>Arthur Calkins, Marian Consecration and Entrustment in Burke, Raymond L.; et al.

Masters such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Giotto]], [[Duccio]] and others produced masterpieces with Marian themes.\n\n==Mother of God==\n[[File:Mary & Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints [[Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers|George]], [[Theodore of Amasea|Theodore]] and angels, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].]]\n\nMary's status as the [[Mother of God]] is clear in the Gospels, and the theological implications of this were defined and confirmed by the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431).  Different aspects of Mary's position as mother have been the subject of a large number of works of Catholic art.\n\nThere was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the Council of Ephesus in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].<ref name=Tim37 >''Mary in Western Art'' by Timothy Verdon 2005 {{ISBN|097129819X}} pages 37-40</ref><ref>''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' 2000 {{ISBN|0877790442}} page 408</ref>\n\nBy the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day.  The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[Session of Christ|exaltation]] above other humans.\n\nAt this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.\n\nThe earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.\n\n===Nativity of Jesus===\n{{main|Nativity of Jesus in art}}\n[[File:Nativity (Throne of Maximianus).jpg|thumb|left|120px|Representation of the Nativity on the Throne of Maximianus in [[Ravenna]]]]\n\nThe [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]] has been a major subject of Christian art since the early 4th century. It has been depicted in many different media, both pictorial and sculptural. Pictorial forms include murals, panel paintings, manuscript illuminations, stained glass windows and oil paintings.\nThe earliest representations of the Nativity itself are very simple, just showing the infant, tightly wrapped, lying near the ground in a trough or wicker basket.\n\nA new form of the image, which from the rare early versions seems to have been formulated in 6th-century Palestine, was to set the essential form of Eastern Orthodox images down to the present day. The setting is now a cave - or rather the specific Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem, already underneath the Church of the Nativity, and well-established as a place of pilgrimage, with the approval of the Church.\n[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|thumb|right|210px|''[[Nativity at Night]]'' ({{circa}} 1490) by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]]]]\n\nWestern artists adopted many of the Byzantine iconographic elements, but preferred the scriptural stable to the cave, though [[Duccio]]'s Byzantine-influenced Maest\u00e0 version tries to have both. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or he looks over to her. Suckling is very unusual, but is sometimes shown.\n\nThe image in later medieval Northern Europe was often influenced by the vision of the Nativity of [[Saint Bridget of Sweden]] (1303\u20131373), a very popular mystic. Shortly before her death, she described a vision of the infant Jesus as lying on the ground, and emitting light himself.\n\nFrom the 15th century onwards, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] increasingly became a more common depiction than the Nativity proper. From the 16th century plain Nativities with just the Holy Family, become a clear minority, although [[Caravaggio]] led a return to a more realistic treatment of the ''Adoration of the Shepherds''.\n\nThe perpetual character of Mary's virginity, namely that she was a virgin all her life and not only at her [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]] of [[Jesus Christ]] at the Annunciation (that she was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to him) is alluded to in some forms of Nativity art: [[Salome (Gospel of James)|Salome]], who according to the story in the 2nd-century ''Nativity of Mary''<ref>[http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html Infancy Gospel of James, chapter 20] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611085726/http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html |date=2008-06-11 }}</ref> received physical proof that Mary remained a virgin even in giving birth to Jesus, is found in many depictions of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Comparative Iconography'' by Helene E. Roberts 1998 {{ISBN|1-57958-009-2}} p. 904</ref>\n\n===Madonna===\n[[File:Fra Filippo Lippi 002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Filippo Lippi]], 1459]]\n{{main|Madonna (art)}}\nThe depiction of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. Important to Italian tradition are Byzantine icons, especially those created in Constantinople (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring medieval civilization whose icons, such as the [[Hodegetria]], participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties. Western depictions remained heavily dependent on Byzantine types until at least the 13th century.  In the late Middle Ages, the [[Cretan school]], under [[Venice|Venetian]] rule, was the source of great numbers of icons exported to the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western iconography when required.\n\n[[File:Sto Dom de Sil-23.JPG|thumb|left|120px|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] enthroned Madonna, [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]]]]\nIn the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]] free-standing statues, typically about half life-size, of the enthroned Madonna and Child were an original Western development, since monumental sculpture was forbidden by Orthodoxy. The [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] of c. 980 is one of the earliest of these, made of gold applied to a wooden core, and still the subject of considerable local veneration, as is the 12th century [[Virgin of Montserrat]] in [[Catalonia]], a more developed treatment.\n\nWith the growth of monumental panel painting in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, this type was frequently painted at the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout Tuscany. While members of the mendicant orders of the Franciscan and Dominican Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and later homes. Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.\n\n====Some key Madonnas====\n[[File:Gardenenclosed.jpg|180px|thumb|right|''[[Our Lady of Sorrows]]'' by [[Miguel Bejarano Moreno|Moreno]], [[Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden|hermitage in Warfhuizen]], the Netherlands.]]\nA number of Madonna paintings and statues have gathered a following as important religious icons and noteworthy works of art in various regions of the world.\n\nSome Madonnas are known by a general name and concept rendered or depicted by various artists. For instance, [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is the patron saint of several countries such as [[Slovakia]] and [[Philippines]]. It is represented as the Virgin Mary wounded by seven swords in her heart, a reference to the prophecy of Simeon at the [[Presentation of Jesus]]. [[Our Lady of Sorrows, Queen of Poland]] located in the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]] (Poland's largest church) is an important icon in Poland. The term ''Our Lady of Sorrows'' is also used in other contexts, without a Madonna, e.g. for [[Our Lady of Kibeho]] apparitions.\n\nSome Madonnas become the subject of widespread devotion, and the Marian shrines dedicated to them attract millions of pilgrims per year. An example is [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] in Brazil, whose shrine is surpassed in size only by [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]], and receives more pilgrims per year than any other [[Roman Catholic Marian church]] in the world.<ref>''Religions of the World'' by J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann 2003 {{ISBN|1576072231}} pages 308-309</ref>\n\n=====Latin America=====\nThere is a rich tradition of building statues of the Madonna in South America, a sampling of which is shown in the galleries section of this article. The South American tradition of Marian art dates back to the 16th century, with the [[Virgin of Copacabana]] gaining fame in 1582.<ref>''Art and architecture of viceregal Latin America, 1521\u20131821'' by Kelly Donahue-Wallace 2008 {{ISBN|0826334598}}</ref> Some noteworthy examples are:\n\n:* [[Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos]] is located in the small town of [[San Juan de los Lagos]] in Mexico.

The devotion started by the 15th century Portuguese navigators, praying for a safe return to their homes and then spread in Brazil.\n\nImages of, and devotions to, Madonnas such as Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos have spread from Mexico to the United States.<ref>''Mapping the Catholic cultural landscape'' by Richard Fossey 2004 {{ISBN|0-7425-3184-8}} p. 78</ref><ref>''Globalizing the sacred: religion across the Americas'' by Manuel A.

Dall'Orto 26-5-2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Christ and Mary, mosaic, [[Chora Church]], 16th century]]\n{{main|Life of the Virgin}}\nScenes of Mary and Jesus together fall into two main groups: those with an infant Jesus, and those from the last period of his life.  After the episodes of the Nativity, there are a number of further narrative scenes of Mary and the infant Jesus together which are often depicted: the [[Circumcision of Christ]], [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]], [[Flight into Egypt]], and less specific scenes of Mary and Jesus with his cousin [[John the Baptist]], sometimes with John's mother [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Virgin of the Rocks]] is a famous example.  Gatherings of the whole extended family of Jesus form a subject known as the [[Holy Kinship]], popular in the [[Northern Renaissance]].  Mary appears in the background of the only incident in the [[Gospel]]s from the later childhood of Jesus, the [[Finding in the Temple]].\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Michelangelo]]'s [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|''Piet\u00e0'']], 1498]]\nMary is then usually absent from scenes of the period of Christ's life between his [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]] and his Passion, except for the [[Wedding at Cana]], where she is placed in the Gospels.  A non-scriptural subject of [[Christ taking leave of his Mother]] (before going to [[Jerusalem]] at the start of his Passion) was often painted in 15th- and early 16th-century Germany.  Mary is placed at the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] by the Gospels, and is almost invariably shown, with Saint [[John the Evangelist]], in fully depicted works, as well as often being shown in the background of earlier scenes of the [[Passion of Christ]].  The [[rood]] cross common in medieval Western churches had statues of Mary and John flanking a central [[crucifix]].  Mary is shown as present at the [[Deposition of Christ]] and his Entombment; in the late Middle Ages the [[Piet\u00e0]] emerged in Germany as a separate subject, especially in sculpture.  Mary is also included, though this is not mentioned in any of the scriptural accounts, in depictions of the [[Ascension of Jesus]].  After the Ascension, she is the centrally-placed figure in depictions of [[Pentecost]], which is her latest appearance in the Gospels.\n\nThe main scenes above, showing incidents celebrated as [[feast day]]s by the church, formed part of cycles of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' (though the selection of scenes in these varied considerably), as well as the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]''.\n\n==Perpetual virginity==\n[[File:Annunciation Melozzo da Forli Pantheon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Fresco of the Annunciation at the [[Pantheon, Rome]], 15th century]]\n\nThe [[dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is the earliest of the four Marian dogmas and Catholic [[liturgy]] has repeatedly referred to Mary as \"ever virgin\" for centuries.<ref>Marian Dogmas at University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/mariandogmas.html</ref><ref>[http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/liturgy/liturgy.html Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom], [http://www.coptic.net/prayers/StBasilLiturgy.html Coptic Liturgy of St Basil], [http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/liturgy/liturgy_of_st_cyril.pdf Liturgy of St Cyril], [http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm Liturgy of St James]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615045105/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm |date=15 June 2008 }}, [http://www.frmichel.najim.net/liturgyvid.pdf Understanding the Orthodox Liturgy], etc.</ref> The dogma means that Mary was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to [[Jesus Christ]].

In many depictions the angel may be holding a [[Lily flower|lily]], symbolic of Mary's virginity.<ref>''Medieval art: a topical dictionary'' by Leslie Ross 1996 {{ISBN|0-313-29329-5}} p. 16</ref> The mosaics of [[Pietro Cavallini]] in [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome (1291), the [[fresco]]s of [[Giotto]] in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] (1303), [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s fresco at the church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]] (1486) and [[Donatello]]'s gilded sculpture at the church of [[Santa Croce, Florence]] (1435) are famous examples.\n\nThe natural composition of the scene, consisting of two figures facing each other, also made it suitable for decorated arches above doorways.\n\n==Immaculate Conception==\n[[File:Inmaculada Concepcion (La Colosal).jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Murillo]]'s ''Immaculate Conception'', 1650]]\n\nGiven that up to the 13th century a series of saints including [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in general had either opposed or questioned this doctrine, Roman Catholic art on the subject mostly dates to periods after the 15th century and is absent from [[Renaissance]] art. But with support from popular opinion, the [[Franciscans]] and theologians such as [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Duns Scotus]], the popularity of the doctrine increased and a feast-day for it was promoted.\n\n[[File:ImmaculateEmblem.jpg|thumb|right|Swiss emblem, 16th century.]]\n[[Pope Pius V]], the Dominican Pope who in 1570 established the [[Tridentine Mass]], included the feast (but without the adjective \"Immaculate\") in the [[Tridentine Calendar]], but suppressed the existing special Mass for the feast, directing that the Mass for the Nativity of Mary (with the word \"Nativity\" replaced by \"Conception\") be used instead.<ref>[http://civitas-dei.eu/cavendish.htm Paul Cavendish, \"The Tridentine Mass\"]</ref> Part of that earlier Mass was revived in the Mass that [[Pope Pius IX]] ordered to be used on the feast and that is still in use.<ref name=Habig>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/LANDMARY.HTM Marion A. Habig, \"Land of Mary Immaculate\"]</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century there was a widespread intellectual fashion for [[emblem]]s in both religious and secular contexts.  These consisted of a visual representation of the symbol (pictura) and usually a Latin [[motto]]; frequently an explanatory epigram was added. [[Emblem book]]s were very popular.<ref>Emblems for Immaculate Conception {{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211015523/https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |archivedate=2008-12-11 }}</ref>\n\nDrawing on the emblem tradition, [[Francisco Pacheco]] established an iconography that influenced artists such as Murillo, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others. This style of representation of the immaculate Conception then spread to the rest of Europe, and has since remained the usual depiction.\n\nThe [[dogmatic definition]] of Immaculate Conception was performed by [[Pope Pius IX]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'', in 1854. The dogma gained additional significance from the apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858, with the lady in the apparition identifying herself as \"the Immaculate Conception\" and the faithful believing her to be the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n\n===Depiction of the Immaculate Conception===\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Piero di Cosimo]] ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505]]\nFrom an art historical perspective, the depiction of the Immaculate Conception involves a number of interesting issues. Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the [[Immaculate Conception]], and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years.\n\nSince a key Scriptural text pointed to in support of the doctrine was \"[[Tota pulchra es]]...\", \"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee\", verse 4.7 from the [[Song of Solomon]],<ref>[http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html The whole text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529140849/http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html |date=2011-05-29 }}</ref> a number of symbolic objects drawn from the imagery of the ''Song'', and often already associated with the Annunciation and the Perpetual Virginity, were combined in versions of the [[Hortus conclusus]] (\"enclosed garden\") subject. This gave a rather cluttered subject, and usually was impossible to combine with correct perspective, so never caught on outside Germany and the [[Low Countries]]. [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists who tried new solutions, but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\n[[File:10 Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n (National Gallery de Londres, c. 1618).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Immaculate Conception]]'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1618]]\nThe definitive iconography for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] (1564\u20131644), to whom the Inquisition in [[Seville]] also contracted the approval of new images. He described his iconography in his ''Art of Painting'' (''Arte de la Pintura'', published posthumously in 1649):\n\n<blockquote>\"The version that I follow is the one that is closest to the holy revelation of the Evangelist and approved by the Catholic Church on the authority of the sacred and holy interpreters... In this loveliest of mysteries Our Lady should be painted as a beautiful young girl, 12 or 13 years old, in the flower of her youth... And thus she is praised by the Husband: ''tota pulchra es amica mea'', a text that is always written in this painting. She should be painted wearing a white tunic and a blue mantle... She is surrounded by the sun, an oval sun of white and ochre, which sweetly blends into the sky.  Rays of light emanate from her head, around which is a [[Circle of stars|ring of twelve stars]].  An imperial crown adorns her head, without, however, hiding the stars.  Under her feet is the moon. Although it is a solid globe, I take the liberty of making it transparent so that the landscape shows through.\"<ref>''\u00c9sot\u00e9risme, gnoses & imaginaire symbolique: m\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} p. 676</ref><ref>''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R. Katz and Robert A. Orsi 2001 {{ISBN|0-19-514557-7}} p. 98</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSpanish artists such as [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]] (especially), [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others adopted this formula, with variations, and it then spread to the rest of Europe, since when it has remained the usual depiction.\n\nThis particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) [[God]]. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1-2. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[cherubs]]. In some paintings the cherubim are holding [[Lilium candidum|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.\n\n==Assumption of Mary==\n[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Titian]] ''Assumption'', 1516]]\n\nThe Catholic doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of Mary into Heaven]] states that Mary was transported into Heaven with her body and soul united. Although the Assumption was only officially declared a [[Roman Catholic dogma|dogma]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' in 1950, its roots in Catholic culture and art go back many centuries. While Pope [[Pius XII]] deliberately left open the question of whether Mary died before her Assumption, the more common teaching of the early Fathers is that she did.<ref>As the Virgin Mary remained an ever-virgin and sinless, it is viewed that the Virgin Mary could not thus suffer the consequences of [[Original Sin]], which is chiefly Death. http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3819.htm Nicea II Session 6 Decree</ref><ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/NICAEA2.HTM#2 Nicaea II Definition, \"without blemish\"]</ref>\n\nAn early supporter of the Assumption was Saint [[John of Damascus]] (676\u2013794), a [[Doctor of the Church]] who is often called the ''Doctor of the Assumption''.<ref>\nChristopher Rengers, ''The 33 Doctors Of The Church'', Tan Books & Publishers, 200, {{ISBN|0-89555-440-2}}</ref> Saint John was not only interested in the Assumption, but also supported the use of holy images in response to the edict by the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], banning the worship or exhibition of holy images.<ref>Mary H. Allies, ''St. John Damascene on Holy Images, Followed by Three Sermons on the Assumption'' London, 1899.</ref> He wrote: \"On this day the sacred and life-filled ark of the living God, she who conceived her Creator in her womb, rests in the Temple of the Lord that is not made with hands. David, her ancestor, leaps, and with him the angels lead the dance.\"\n\nThe Eastern Church held the feast of the Assumption as early as the second half of the 6th century, and [[Pope Sergius I]] (687\u2013701) ordered its observance in Rome.<ref>University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/maryassump1.html</ref>\n\nThe Orthodox tradition is clear that Mary died normally, before being bodily assumed. The Orthodox term for the death is the [[Dormition of the Virgin]].  Byzantine depictions of this were the basis for Western images, the subject being known as the [[Death of the Virgin]] in the West.  As the nature of the Assumption became controversial during the High Middle Ages, the subject was often avoided, but depiction continued to be common until the Reformation.  The last major Catholic depiction is [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'' of 1606.\n\nMeanwhile, depictions of the Assumption had been becoming more frequent during the late Middle Ages, with the Gothic [[Siena|Siennese]] school a particular source. By the 16th century they had become the norm, initially in Italy, and then elsewhere.  They were sometimes combined with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], as the [[Trinity]] waited in the clouds.  The subject was very suited to Baroque treatment.\n\n==Queen of Heaven==\n{{Main|Queen of Heaven}}\n[[File:SalusPopuliromanicrowned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Salus Populi Romani]] crowned by [[Pope Pius XII]]]]\n\nThe Roman Catholic teaching that Mary is far above all other creatures in dignity, and after [[Jesus Christ]] possesses primacy over all goes back to the early church. Saint [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] said: \"You have surpassed every creature\" and Saint [[Germain of Paris]] (469\u2013576) stated: \"Your honor and dignity surpass the whole of creation; your greatness places you above the angels.\" Saint [[John of Damascus]] went further: \"Limitless is the difference between God's servants and His Mother.\"<ref>Dictionary of Mary, Catholic Book Publishing Co., New York, 1985</ref><ref>[[Ad Caeli Reginam]] 40</ref>\n\n[[File:PiusXIISaluspopuli.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Coronation of the icon by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1954]]\nThe feast of the [[Queenship of Mary]] was only formally established in 1954 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[encyclical]] [[Ad Caeli Reginam]]. Pius XII also declare the first Marian year and a number of [[Roman Catholic Church]] rededications took place, e.g. the 1955 rededication of the church of ''Saint James the Great'' in [[Montreal]] with the new title [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]] a title proclaimed by Pius XII.\n\nYet, long before 1954 the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] had been the subject of a good number of artistic works. Some of these paintings built on the third phase of the Assumption of Mary in which following her Assumption, she is crowned as the ''[[Queen of Heaven]]''.\n\n== Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times ==\n[[File:Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times (by Vito Petrus).jpg|thumb]]\nThis icon has two Gospel passages written on it. The first one is, Mark 14:72.\n\nImmediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.\n\nThe second one is, John 21:15-19.\n\nWhen they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of Jonas, do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my lambs. \u201cA second time he said to him, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cTend my sheep. \u201cHe said to him the third time, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time \u201cDo you love me?\u201d And he said to him, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.\u201d He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God. After this he said to him, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nAs we know by tradition, the apostle Peter was in charge of the rest of the eleven apostles since the beginning even before when Jesus told him, \u201cAnd I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.\u201d Matthew 16:18.\n\nThis means that from the time when Peter denied Jesus and the rooster crowed on Holy Thursday, till the time when Jesus appeared to his disciples for the third time after he was raised from the dead and asked him three times if he loves Him, no one was in charge of the church characterized by the faithful and the apostles, but instead of Peter, Mary the Mother of Jesus was in charge of it, and that is why this icon depicts her with two keys in her hands given to her by Jesus Himself depicted as a child to show that this was already planned by God the Father beforehand.\n\nThe other title Our Lady of the end of Times, is given to her because due to the confusion in the church that we are experiencing today, she is not just in charge of the church instead of the successor of Peter as she was before after Peter\u2019s denial of Jesus, but she has this double title due to the end of times as prophesied by many mystics and in the Bible itself.\n\n==Apparitions==\n[[File:Virgen de F\u00e1tima.JPG|thumb|200px|The statue of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] includes several Catholic elements, such as being apparition-based, being a crowned statue and holding a [[Rosary]]. One of the bullets that wounded [[Pope John Paul II]] in [[St. Peter's Square]] in 1981 was placed in the crown of the statue.<ref name=Guiley >{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Saints |author= [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |year=2001 |isbn= 0-8160-4134-2 |page=162 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]}}</ref>]]\n\nRoman Catholic devotion to Mary has at times been driven by [[Marian apparition|religious experiences and visions]] of simple and modest individuals (in many cases children) on remote hilltops which in time have created strong emotions among large numbers of Roman Catholics. Examples include Saint [[Juan Diego]] in 1531 as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous]] as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858 and [[Lucia dos Santos]], [[Jacinta Marto]] and [[Francisco Marto]] as [[Our Lady of Fatima]] in 1917.<ref>Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}</ref>\n\nAlthough every year over five million pilgrims visit Lourdes and Guadalupe each, the volume of Roman Catholic art to accompany this enthusiasm has been essentially restricted to popular images. Hence although apparitions have resulted in the construction of very large Marian churches at [[Lourdes]] and [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]] they have not so far had a similar impact on Marian art. Yet images such as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] and the artistic renditions of it as statues are not simply works of art but are a central elements of the daily lives of the Mexican people.<ref name= Meade >''A History of Modern Latin America'' by Teresa A.

From the very beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation]] its leaders expressed their discomfort with the depictions of saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition of art developed, the depictions of the Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and view it as a Catholic excess.<ref name=Hillerbrand >''The encyclopedia of Protestantism'' edited by Hans Joachim Hillerbrand 2003 {{ISBN|0-415-92472-3}} pp. 171\u2013173</ref><ref>''Mary in Western art'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} p. 61</ref><ref>''Christian art'' by Beth Williamson 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-280328-X}} pp. 102\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgen del Carmen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The use of Marian [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Brown Scapular]] is a distinguishing feature of Catholic art.]]\nUnlike the majority of the Protestants, the Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Marian images, but in a different manner and with a different emphasis from the Catholic tradition. While statues of the Virgin Mary abound in Catholic churches, there are specific prohibitions against all three-dimensional representations (of Mary or any other any saints) within the Orthodox Church, for they are regarded as remnants of pagan idolatry. Hence the Orthodox only produce and venerate two-dimensional images.<ref name=Benz >''The Eastern Orthodox Church: Its Thought and Life'' by Ernst Benz 2009 {{ISBN|0-202-36298-1}} pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=Mylonas >''Serbian orthodox fundamentals'' by Christos Mylonas 2003 {{ISBN|963-9241-61-X}} pp. 45\u201348</ref><ref name=Flinn >Encyclopedia of Catholicism'' by Frank K.

In fact, there is a three way, carefully coordinated interplay of prayers, icons and [[hymns to Mary]] within Orthodox liturgy, at times with specific feasts that relate to the Theotokos icons and the [[Hymns to Mary|Akathists]].<ref name=Benz /><ref name=Dragas /><ref>''America's religions: from their origins to the twenty-first century'' by Peter W.

The rich background representation of flowers or gardens found in Catholic art are not present in Orthodox depictions whose primary focus is the Theotokos, often with the [[Child Jesus]].<ref name=McPherson >''Keeping silence: Christian practices for entering stillness'' by C.

Alles 2007 {{ISBN|0-8160-6141-6}} pp. 33\u201334</ref> Apparition-based images such as the statues of the [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] accentuate the differences in that they are based on apparitions that are purely Catholic, as well as being three-dimensional representations. And the presence of [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Rosary]] and the [[Brown Scapular]] on the statues of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] emphasize a totally Catholic form of Marian art.\n\nApart from stylistic issues, significant doctrinal differences separate Catholic Marian art from other Christian approaches.

Other influences on Marian art have been the [[Feast day]]s of the Church, [[Marian apparition]]s, [[Mariology of the saints|writings of the saints]] and popular devotions such as the [[rosary]], the [[Stations of the Cross]], or total consecration, and also [[Mariology of the popes|papal initiatives]], and [[Marian papal encyclicals and Apostolic Letters]].\n\nEach of these fundamental Mariological beliefs has given rise to Roman Catholic Marian art that has become part of Mariology, by emphasizing Marian veneration, being celebrated in specific Marian feasts, or becoming part of key Roman Catholic Marian churches. This article's focus is primarily on how the artistic component of Roman Catholic Mariology has represented the fundamental [[Marian doctrines of the Catholic Church]], and has thus interacted with them, creating a force that has shaped Catholic Mariology over the centuries.\n\n{{RC-Mariology}}\n\n==Blending of art, theology and spirituality==\n{{see also2|[[Marian devotions]]|[[Silent preaching]]|[[Rosary devotions and spirituality|Rosary devotions]]}}\n[[File:Virgin salus populi romani.jpg|right|thumb|[[Salus Populi Romani]], a popular icon in Rome.]]\n\nArt has been an integral element of the Catholic identity since the very beginning.<ref name=Donovan >''Distinctively Catholic: an exploration of Catholic identity'' by Daniel Donovan 1997 {{ISBN|0-8091-3750-X}} pp. 96\u201398</ref> Medieval Catholicism cherished relics and pilgrimages to visit them were common.

[[Roman Catholic Marian music|Marian music]] and [[Roman Catholic Marian churches|Marian shrines]] interact with Marian art as key components of Mariology, e.g. the construction of major Marian churches gives rise to major pieces of art for the decoration of the church.<ref>Janusz Rosikon, 2001, ''The Madonnas of Europe: Pilgrimages to the Great Marian Shrines'' {{ISBN|978-0-89870-849-3}}</ref><ref>Edel 2006, ''Madonna: Sacred Art And Holy Music'' {{ISBN|9783937406404}}</ref><ref>University of Dayton Marian Music https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php</ref><ref>Peter Mullen ''Shrines of Our Lady'' {{ISBN|978-0-312-19503-8}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, [[Gabriele Paleotti]]'s ''Discourse on Sacred and Profane Images'' became known as the \"Catechism of images\" for Catholics, given that it established key concepts for the use of images as a form of religious instruction and indoctrination via [[silent preaching]] (''muta predicatio'').<ref name=Mitchell >''The Mystery of the Rosary: Marian Devotion and the Reinvention of Catholicism'' by Nathan Mitchell 2009 {{ISBN|0-8147-9591-9}} pp. 37\u201342</ref><ref name=Barber >''The road from Eden: studies in Christianity and culture'' by John Barber 2008 {{ISBN|1-933146-34-6}} p. 288</ref> Paleotti's approach was implemented by his powerful contemporary Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] and his focus on \"the transformation of Christian life through vision\" and the \"nonverbal [[rules of language]]\" shaped the Catholic reinterpretations of the Virgin Mary in the 16th and 17th centuries and fostered and promoted Marian devotions such as the Rosary.<ref name=Mitchell /><ref name=Barber />\n\nAn example of the interaction of Marian art, culture and churches is [[Salus Populi Romani]], a key Marian icon in Rome at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], the earliest Marian church in Rome. The practice of crowning the images of Mary started at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome by Pope [[Clement VIII]] in the 17th century.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07664a.htm Catholic encyclopedia]</ref> In 1899 Eugenio Pacelli (later [[Pope Pius XII]]) said his first Holy Mass in front of it at the [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. Fifty years later, he physically crowned this picture as part of the first Marian year in Church history, as he proclaimed the [[Queenship of Mary]]. The image was carried from Santa Maria Maggiore around Rome as part of the celebration of the Marian year and the proclamation of the Queenship of Mary.\n\nAnother example is [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]].

The widespread Catholic use of replicas of the statue of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] emphasizes devotions to the [[Immaculate Conception]] and the [[Rosary]], both reported in the Lourdes messages. To Catholics, the distinctive blue and white Lourdes statues are reminders of the emphasis of Lourdes on [[Rosary devotions and spirituality|Rosary devotions]] and the millions of pilgrimages to the [[Rosary Basilica]] at Lourdes shows how Churches, devotions and art intertwine within Catholic culture. The Rosary remains the prayer of choice among Catholics who visit Lourdes or venerate the Lourdes statues worldwide.<ref>''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 {{ISBN|90-04-12654-6}} p. 339</ref><ref>''Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac'' by Matthew Bunson 2008 {{ISBN|1-59276-441-X}} p. 123</ref><ref>''The Mystery of the Rosary'' by Nathan Mitchell 2009 {{ISBN|0-8147-9591-9}} p. 193</ref><ref>''China's Catholics'' by Richard Madsen 1998 {{ISBN|0-520-21326-2}} pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nHistorically, Marian art has not only impacted the image of Mary among Catholics, but that of Jesus.

In the 12th century [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]] in France used the motif of the ''protective mantle'' of the Virgin Mary which shielded the kneeling abbots and abbesses. In the 13th century [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] was also aware of this motif, which eventually led to the iconography of the [[Virgin of Mercy]] and an increased focused on the concept of Marian protection.<ref>Arthur Calkins, Marian Consecration and Entrustment in Burke, Raymond L.; et al.

Some of the earliest Marian churches in Rome date to the 5th century, such as [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] and Santa Maria Maggiore, and these churches were in turn decorated with significant works of art through the centuries.<ref>''Image and Relic: Mediating the Sacred in Early Medieval Rome'' by Erik Thun 2003 {{ISBN|8882652173}} pages 33-35</ref><ref name=Tim37 /> The interaction of Marian art and church construction thus influenced the development of Marian art.<ref>Michael Rose, 2004, ''In Tiers of Glory: The Organic Development of Catholic Church Architecture through the Ages'' Mesa Folio editions, {{ISBN|0967637120}} pages 9-12</ref>\n\nThe Virgin Mary has since become a major subject of Western Art. Masters such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Giotto]], [[Duccio]] and others produced masterpieces with Marian themes.\n\n==Mother of God==\n[[File:Mary & Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints [[Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers|George]], [[Theodore of Amasea|Theodore]] and angels, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].]]\n\nMary's status as the [[Mother of God]] is clear in the Gospels, and the theological implications of this were defined and confirmed by the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431).  Different aspects of Mary's position as mother have been the subject of a large number of works of Catholic art.\n\nThere was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the Council of Ephesus in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].<ref name=Tim37 >''Mary in Western Art'' by Timothy Verdon 2005 {{ISBN|097129819X}} pages 37-40</ref><ref>''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' 2000 {{ISBN|0877790442}} page 408</ref>\n\nBy the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day.  The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[Session of Christ|exaltation]] above other humans.\n\nAt this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.\n\nThe earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.\n\n===Nativity of Jesus===\n{{main|Nativity of Jesus in art}}\n[[File:Nativity (Throne of Maximianus).jpg|thumb|left|120px|Representation of the Nativity on the Throne of Maximianus in [[Ravenna]]]]\n\nThe [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]] has been a major subject of Christian art since the early 4th century. It has been depicted in many different media, both pictorial and sculptural. Pictorial forms include murals, panel paintings, manuscript illuminations, stained glass windows and oil paintings.\nThe earliest representations of the Nativity itself are very simple, just showing the infant, tightly wrapped, lying near the ground in a trough or wicker basket.\n\nA new form of the image, which from the rare early versions seems to have been formulated in 6th-century Palestine, was to set the essential form of Eastern Orthodox images down to the present day. The setting is now a cave - or rather the specific Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem, already underneath the Church of the Nativity, and well-established as a place of pilgrimage, with the approval of the Church.\n[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|thumb|right|210px|''[[Nativity at Night]]'' ({{circa}} 1490) by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]]]]\n\nWestern artists adopted many of the Byzantine iconographic elements, but preferred the scriptural stable to the cave, though [[Duccio]]'s Byzantine-influenced Maest\u00e0 version tries to have both. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or he looks over to her. Suckling is very unusual, but is sometimes shown.\n\nThe image in later medieval Northern Europe was often influenced by the vision of the Nativity of [[Saint Bridget of Sweden]] (1303\u20131373), a very popular mystic. Shortly before her death, she described a vision of the infant Jesus as lying on the ground, and emitting light himself.\n\nFrom the 15th century onwards, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] increasingly became a more common depiction than the Nativity proper. From the 16th century plain Nativities with just the Holy Family, become a clear minority, although [[Caravaggio]] led a return to a more realistic treatment of the ''Adoration of the Shepherds''.\n\nThe perpetual character of Mary's virginity, namely that she was a virgin all her life and not only at her [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]] of [[Jesus Christ]] at the Annunciation (that she was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to him) is alluded to in some forms of Nativity art: [[Salome (Gospel of James)|Salome]], who according to the story in the 2nd-century ''Nativity of Mary''<ref>[http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html Infancy Gospel of James, chapter 20] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611085726/http://www.gospels.net/translations/infancyjamestranslation.html |date=2008-06-11 }}</ref> received physical proof that Mary remained a virgin even in giving birth to Jesus, is found in many depictions of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Comparative Iconography'' by Helene E. Roberts 1998 {{ISBN|1-57958-009-2}} p. 904</ref>\n\n===Madonna===\n[[File:Fra Filippo Lippi 002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Filippo Lippi]], 1459]]\n{{main|Madonna (art)}}\nThe depiction of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. Important to Italian tradition are Byzantine icons, especially those created in Constantinople (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring medieval civilization whose icons, such as the [[Hodegetria]], participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties. Western depictions remained heavily dependent on Byzantine types until at least the 13th century.  In the late Middle Ages, the [[Cretan school]], under [[Venice|Venetian]] rule, was the source of great numbers of icons exported to the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western iconography when required.\n\n[[File:Sto Dom de Sil-23.JPG|thumb|left|120px|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] enthroned Madonna, [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]]]]\nIn the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]] free-standing statues, typically about half life-size, of the enthroned Madonna and Child were an original Western development, since monumental sculpture was forbidden by Orthodoxy. The [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] of c. 980 is one of the earliest of these, made of gold applied to a wooden core, and still the subject of considerable local veneration, as is the 12th century [[Virgin of Montserrat]] in [[Catalonia]], a more developed treatment.\n\nWith the growth of monumental panel painting in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, this type was frequently painted at the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout Tuscany. While members of the mendicant orders of the Franciscan and Dominican Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and later homes. Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.\n\n====Some key Madonnas====\n[[File:Gardenenclosed.jpg|180px|thumb|right|''[[Our Lady of Sorrows]]'' by [[Miguel Bejarano Moreno|Moreno]], [[Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden|hermitage in Warfhuizen]], the Netherlands.]]\nA number of Madonna paintings and statues have gathered a following as important religious icons and noteworthy works of art in various regions of the world.\n\nSome Madonnas are known by a general name and concept rendered or depicted by various artists. For instance, [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is the patron saint of several countries such as [[Slovakia]] and [[Philippines]]. It is represented as the Virgin Mary wounded by seven swords in her heart, a reference to the prophecy of Simeon at the [[Presentation of Jesus]]. [[Our Lady of Sorrows, Queen of Poland]] located in the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]] (Poland's largest church) is an important icon in Poland. The term ''Our Lady of Sorrows'' is also used in other contexts, without a Madonna, e.g. for [[Our Lady of Kibeho]] apparitions.\n\nSome Madonnas become the subject of widespread devotion, and the Marian shrines dedicated to them attract millions of pilgrims per year. An example is [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] in Brazil, whose shrine is surpassed in size only by [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]], and receives more pilgrims per year than any other [[Roman Catholic Marian church]] in the world.<ref>''Religions of the World'' by J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann 2003 {{ISBN|1576072231}} pages 308-309</ref>\n\n=====Latin America=====\nThere is a rich tradition of building statues of the Madonna in South America, a sampling of which is shown in the galleries section of this article.

Dall'Orto 26-5-2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Christ and Mary, mosaic, [[Chora Church]], 16th century]]\n{{main|Life of the Virgin}}\nScenes of Mary and Jesus together fall into two main groups: those with an infant Jesus, and those from the last period of his life.  After the episodes of the Nativity, there are a number of further narrative scenes of Mary and the infant Jesus together which are often depicted: the [[Circumcision of Christ]], [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]], [[Flight into Egypt]], and less specific scenes of Mary and Jesus with his cousin [[John the Baptist]], sometimes with John's mother [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Virgin of the Rocks]] is a famous example.  Gatherings of the whole extended family of Jesus form a subject known as the [[Holy Kinship]], popular in the [[Northern Renaissance]].  Mary appears in the background of the only incident in the [[Gospel]]s from the later childhood of Jesus, the [[Finding in the Temple]].\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Michelangelo]]'s [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|''Piet\u00e0'']], 1498]]\nMary is then usually absent from scenes of the period of Christ's life between his [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]] and his Passion, except for the [[Wedding at Cana]], where she is placed in the Gospels.  A non-scriptural subject of [[Christ taking leave of his Mother]] (before going to [[Jerusalem]] at the start of his Passion) was often painted in 15th- and early 16th-century Germany.  Mary is placed at the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] by the Gospels, and is almost invariably shown, with Saint [[John the Evangelist]], in fully depicted works, as well as often being shown in the background of earlier scenes of the [[Passion of Christ]].  The [[rood]] cross common in medieval Western churches had statues of Mary and John flanking a central [[crucifix]].  Mary is shown as present at the [[Deposition of Christ]] and his Entombment; in the late Middle Ages the [[Piet\u00e0]] emerged in Germany as a separate subject, especially in sculpture.  Mary is also included, though this is not mentioned in any of the scriptural accounts, in depictions of the [[Ascension of Jesus]].  After the Ascension, she is the centrally-placed figure in depictions of [[Pentecost]], which is her latest appearance in the Gospels.\n\nThe main scenes above, showing incidents celebrated as [[feast day]]s by the church, formed part of cycles of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' (though the selection of scenes in these varied considerably), as well as the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]''.\n\n==Perpetual virginity==\n[[File:Annunciation Melozzo da Forli Pantheon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Fresco of the Annunciation at the [[Pantheon, Rome]], 15th century]]\n\nThe [[dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is the earliest of the four Marian dogmas and Catholic [[liturgy]] has repeatedly referred to Mary as \"ever virgin\" for centuries.<ref>Marian Dogmas at University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/mariandogmas.html</ref><ref>[http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/liturgy/liturgy.html Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom], [http://www.coptic.net/prayers/StBasilLiturgy.html Coptic Liturgy of St Basil], [http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/liturgy/liturgy_of_st_cyril.pdf Liturgy of St Cyril], [http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm Liturgy of St James]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615045105/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm |date=15 June 2008 }}, [http://www.frmichel.najim.net/liturgyvid.pdf Understanding the Orthodox Liturgy], etc.</ref> The dogma means that Mary was a virgin before, during and after giving birth to [[Jesus Christ]].

But with support from popular opinion, the [[Franciscans]] and theologians such as [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Duns Scotus]], the popularity of the doctrine increased and a feast-day for it was promoted.\n\n[[File:ImmaculateEmblem.jpg|thumb|right|Swiss emblem, 16th century.]]\n[[Pope Pius V]], the Dominican Pope who in 1570 established the [[Tridentine Mass]], included the feast (but without the adjective \"Immaculate\") in the [[Tridentine Calendar]], but suppressed the existing special Mass for the feast, directing that the Mass for the Nativity of Mary (with the word \"Nativity\" replaced by \"Conception\") be used instead.<ref>[http://civitas-dei.eu/cavendish.htm Paul Cavendish, \"The Tridentine Mass\"]</ref> Part of that earlier Mass was revived in the Mass that [[Pope Pius IX]] ordered to be used on the feast and that is still in use.<ref name=Habig>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/LANDMARY.HTM Marion A. Habig, \"Land of Mary Immaculate\"]</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century there was a widespread intellectual fashion for [[emblem]]s in both religious and secular contexts.  These consisted of a visual representation of the symbol (pictura) and usually a Latin [[motto]]; frequently an explanatory epigram was added. [[Emblem book]]s were very popular.<ref>Emblems for Immaculate Conception {{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211015523/https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/birth-of-mary-meditation-and-illustrations.php |archivedate=2008-12-11 }}</ref>\n\nDrawing on the emblem tradition, [[Francisco Pacheco]] established an iconography that influenced artists such as Murillo, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others. This style of representation of the immaculate Conception then spread to the rest of Europe, and has since remained the usual depiction.\n\nThe [[dogmatic definition]] of Immaculate Conception was performed by [[Pope Pius IX]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'', in 1854. The dogma gained additional significance from the apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858, with the lady in the apparition identifying herself as \"the Immaculate Conception\" and the faithful believing her to be the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n\n===Depiction of the Immaculate Conception===\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Piero di Cosimo]] ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505]]\nFrom an art historical perspective, the depiction of the Immaculate Conception involves a number of interesting issues. Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the [[Immaculate Conception]], and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years.\n\nSince a key Scriptural text pointed to in support of the doctrine was \"[[Tota pulchra es]]...\", \"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee\", verse 4.7 from the [[Song of Solomon]],<ref>[http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html The whole text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529140849/http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html |date=2011-05-29 }}</ref> a number of symbolic objects drawn from the imagery of the ''Song'', and often already associated with the Annunciation and the Perpetual Virginity, were combined in versions of the [[Hortus conclusus]] (\"enclosed garden\") subject. This gave a rather cluttered subject, and usually was impossible to combine with correct perspective, so never caught on outside Germany and the [[Low Countries]]. [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists who tried new solutions, but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\n[[File:10 Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n (National Gallery de Londres, c. 1618).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Immaculate Conception]]'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1618]]\nThe definitive iconography for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] (1564\u20131644), to whom the Inquisition in [[Seville]] also contracted the approval of new images. He described his iconography in his ''Art of Painting'' (''Arte de la Pintura'', published posthumously in 1649):\n\n<blockquote>\"The version that I follow is the one that is closest to the holy revelation of the Evangelist and approved by the Catholic Church on the authority of the sacred and holy interpreters... In this loveliest of mysteries Our Lady should be painted as a beautiful young girl, 12 or 13 years old, in the flower of her youth... And thus she is praised by the Husband: ''tota pulchra es amica mea'', a text that is always written in this painting. She should be painted wearing a white tunic and a blue mantle... She is surrounded by the sun, an oval sun of white and ochre, which sweetly blends into the sky.  Rays of light emanate from her head, around which is a [[Circle of stars|ring of twelve stars]].  An imperial crown adorns her head, without, however, hiding the stars.  Under her feet is the moon. Although it is a solid globe, I take the liberty of making it transparent so that the landscape shows through.\"<ref>''\u00c9sot\u00e9risme, gnoses & imaginaire symbolique: m\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} p. 676</ref><ref>''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R. Katz and Robert A. Orsi 2001 {{ISBN|0-19-514557-7}} p. 98</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSpanish artists such as [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]] (especially), [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and others adopted this formula, with variations, and it then spread to the rest of Europe, since when it has remained the usual depiction.\n\nThis particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) [[God]]. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1-2. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[cherubs]]. In some paintings the cherubim are holding [[Lilium candidum|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.\n\n==Assumption of Mary==\n[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Titian]] ''Assumption'', 1516]]\n\nThe Catholic doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of Mary into Heaven]] states that Mary was transported into Heaven with her body and soul united. Although the Assumption was only officially declared a [[Roman Catholic dogma|dogma]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' in 1950, its roots in Catholic culture and art go back many centuries. While Pope [[Pius XII]] deliberately left open the question of whether Mary died before her Assumption, the more common teaching of the early Fathers is that she did.<ref>As the Virgin Mary remained an ever-virgin and sinless, it is viewed that the Virgin Mary could not thus suffer the consequences of [[Original Sin]], which is chiefly Death. http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3819.htm Nicea II Session 6 Decree</ref><ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/NICAEA2.HTM#2 Nicaea II Definition, \"without blemish\"]</ref>\n\nAn early supporter of the Assumption was Saint [[John of Damascus]] (676\u2013794), a [[Doctor of the Church]] who is often called the ''Doctor of the Assumption''.<ref>\nChristopher Rengers, ''The 33 Doctors Of The Church'', Tan Books & Publishers, 200, {{ISBN|0-89555-440-2}}</ref> Saint John was not only interested in the Assumption, but also supported the use of holy images in response to the edict by the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], banning the worship or exhibition of holy images.<ref>Mary H. Allies, ''St. John Damascene on Holy Images, Followed by Three Sermons on the Assumption'' London, 1899.</ref> He wrote: \"On this day the sacred and life-filled ark of the living God, she who conceived her Creator in her womb, rests in the Temple of the Lord that is not made with hands. David, her ancestor, leaps, and with him the angels lead the dance.\"\n\nThe Eastern Church held the feast of the Assumption as early as the second half of the 6th century, and [[Pope Sergius I]] (687\u2013701) ordered its observance in Rome.<ref>University of Dayton http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/maryassump1.html</ref>\n\nThe Orthodox tradition is clear that Mary died normally, before being bodily assumed. The Orthodox term for the death is the [[Dormition of the Virgin]].  Byzantine depictions of this were the basis for Western images, the subject being known as the [[Death of the Virgin]] in the West.  As the nature of the Assumption became controversial during the High Middle Ages, the subject was often avoided, but depiction continued to be common until the Reformation.  The last major Catholic depiction is [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'' of 1606.\n\nMeanwhile, depictions of the Assumption had been becoming more frequent during the late Middle Ages, with the Gothic [[Siena|Siennese]] school a particular source. By the 16th century they had become the norm, initially in Italy, and then elsewhere.  They were sometimes combined with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], as the [[Trinity]] waited in the clouds.  The subject was very suited to Baroque treatment.\n\n==Queen of Heaven==\n{{Main|Queen of Heaven}}\n[[File:SalusPopuliromanicrowned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Salus Populi Romani]] crowned by [[Pope Pius XII]]]]\n\nThe Roman Catholic teaching that Mary is far above all other creatures in dignity, and after [[Jesus Christ]] possesses primacy over all goes back to the early church. Saint [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] said: \"You have surpassed every creature\" and Saint [[Germain of Paris]] (469\u2013576) stated: \"Your honor and dignity surpass the whole of creation; your greatness places you above the angels.\" Saint [[John of Damascus]] went further: \"Limitless is the difference between God's servants and His Mother.\"<ref>Dictionary of Mary, Catholic Book Publishing Co., New York, 1985</ref><ref>[[Ad Caeli Reginam]] 40</ref>\n\n[[File:PiusXIISaluspopuli.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Coronation of the icon by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1954]]\nThe feast of the [[Queenship of Mary]] was only formally established in 1954 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his [[encyclical]] [[Ad Caeli Reginam]]. Pius XII also declare the first Marian year and a number of [[Roman Catholic Church]] rededications took place, e.g. the 1955 rededication of the church of ''Saint James the Great'' in [[Montreal]] with the new title [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]] a title proclaimed by Pius XII.\n\nYet, long before 1954 the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] had been the subject of a good number of artistic works. Some of these paintings built on the third phase of the Assumption of Mary in which following her Assumption, she is crowned as the ''[[Queen of Heaven]]''.\n\n== Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times ==\n[[File:Our Lady of the Keys and of the end of Times (by Vito Petrus).jpg|thumb]]\nThis icon has two Gospel passages written on it. The first one is, Mark 14:72.\n\nImmediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.\n\nThe second one is, John 21:15-19.\n\nWhen they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \u201cSimon son of Jonas, do you love me more than these?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my lambs. \u201cA second time he said to him, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cTend my sheep. \u201cHe said to him the third time, \u201cSimon son of Jonas do you love me?\u201d Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time \u201cDo you love me?\u201d And he said to him, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.\u201d He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God. After this he said to him, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nAs we know by tradition, the apostle Peter was in charge of the rest of the eleven apostles since the beginning even before when Jesus told him, \u201cAnd I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.\u201d Matthew 16:18.\n\nThis means that from the time when Peter denied Jesus and the rooster crowed on Holy Thursday, till the time when Jesus appeared to his disciples for the third time after he was raised from the dead and asked him three times if he loves Him, no one was in charge of the church characterized by the faithful and the apostles, but instead of Peter, Mary the Mother of Jesus was in charge of it, and that is why this icon depicts her with two keys in her hands given to her by Jesus Himself depicted as a child to show that this was already planned by God the Father beforehand.\n\nThe other title Our Lady of the end of Times, is given to her because due to the confusion in the church that we are experiencing today, she is not just in charge of the church instead of the successor of Peter as she was before after Peter\u2019s denial of Jesus, but she has this double title due to the end of times as prophesied by many mystics and in the Bible itself.\n\n==Apparitions==\n[[File:Virgen de F\u00e1tima.JPG|thumb|200px|The statue of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] includes several Catholic elements, such as being apparition-based, being a crowned statue and holding a [[Rosary]]. One of the bullets that wounded [[Pope John Paul II]] in [[St. Peter's Square]] in 1981 was placed in the crown of the statue.<ref name=Guiley >{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Saints |author= [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |year=2001 |isbn= 0-8160-4134-2 |page=162 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]}}</ref>]]\n\nRoman Catholic devotion to Mary has at times been driven by [[Marian apparition|religious experiences and visions]] of simple and modest individuals (in many cases children) on remote hilltops which in time have created strong emotions among large numbers of Roman Catholics. Examples include Saint [[Juan Diego]] in 1531 as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous]] as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858 and [[Lucia dos Santos]], [[Jacinta Marto]] and [[Francisco Marto]] as [[Our Lady of Fatima]] in 1917.<ref>Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}</ref>\n\nAlthough every year over five million pilgrims visit Lourdes and Guadalupe each, the volume of Roman Catholic art to accompany this enthusiasm has been essentially restricted to popular images. Hence although apparitions have resulted in the construction of very large Marian churches at [[Lourdes]] and [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]] they have not so far had a similar impact on Marian art. Yet images such as [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] and the artistic renditions of it as statues are not simply works of art but are a central elements of the daily lives of the Mexican people.<ref name= Meade >''A History of Modern Latin America'' by Teresa A.

From the very beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation]] its leaders expressed their discomfort with the depictions of saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition of art developed, the depictions of the Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and view it as a Catholic excess.<ref name=Hillerbrand >''The encyclopedia of Protestantism'' edited by Hans Joachim Hillerbrand 2003 {{ISBN|0-415-92472-3}} pp. 171\u2013173</ref><ref>''Mary in Western art'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} p. 61</ref><ref>''Christian art'' by Beth Williamson 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-280328-X}} pp. 102\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgen del Carmen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The use of Marian [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Brown Scapular]] is a distinguishing feature of Catholic art.]]\nUnlike the majority of the Protestants, the Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Marian images, but in a different manner and with a different emphasis from the Catholic tradition. While statues of the Virgin Mary abound in Catholic churches, there are specific prohibitions against all three-dimensional representations (of Mary or any other any saints) within the Orthodox Church, for they are regarded as remnants of pagan idolatry. Hence the Orthodox only produce and venerate two-dimensional images.<ref name=Benz >''The Eastern Orthodox Church: Its Thought and Life'' by Ernst Benz 2009 {{ISBN|0-202-36298-1}} pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=Mylonas >''Serbian orthodox fundamentals'' by Christos Mylonas 2003 {{ISBN|963-9241-61-X}} pp. 45\u201348</ref><ref name=Flinn >Encyclopedia of Catholicism'' by Frank K.

In fact, there is a three way, carefully coordinated interplay of prayers, icons and [[hymns to Mary]] within Orthodox liturgy, at times with specific feasts that relate to the Theotokos icons and the [[Hymns to Mary|Akathists]].<ref name=Benz /><ref name=Dragas /><ref>''America's religions: from their origins to the twenty-first century'' by Peter W.

The rich background representation of flowers or gardens found in Catholic art are not present in Orthodox depictions whose primary focus is the Theotokos, often with the [[Child Jesus]].<ref name=McPherson >''Keeping silence: Christian practices for entering stillness'' by C.

Alles 2007 {{ISBN|0-8160-6141-6}} pp. 33\u201334</ref> Apparition-based images such as the statues of the [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] accentuate the differences in that they are based on apparitions that are purely Catholic, as well as being three-dimensional representations. And the presence of [[Sacramentals]] such as the [[Rosary]] and the [[Brown Scapular]] on the statues of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] emphasize a totally Catholic form of Marian art.\n\nApart from stylistic issues, significant doctrinal differences separate Catholic Marian art from other Christian approaches. Three examples are the depictions that involve the [[Immaculate Conception]], [[Queen of Heaven]] and the [[Assumption of Mary]]. Given that the Immaculate Conception is a mostly Catholic doctrine, its depictions within other Christian traditions remain rare.<ref>Mark Miravalle, 1993, ''Introduction to Mary'', Queenship Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-882972-06-7}} pp. 64\u201370</ref> The same applies to ''Queen of Heaven'', for long an element of Catholic tradition (and eventually the subject of the encyclical ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'') but its representation within themes such as the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] continue to remain mostly Catholic.<ref name=Reginam >[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_11101954_ad-caeli-reginam_en.html Encyclical ''Ad Caeli Reginam'' on the Vatican website]</ref> While the Eastern Orthodox support the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]], they do not support the Catholic doctrines of the [[Assumption of Mary]] and hence their depictions of the dormition are distinct and the Virgin Mary is usually shown sleeping surrounded by saints, while Catholic depictions often show Mary rising to Heaven.<ref name=Dragas >''Ecclesiasticus II: Orthodox Icons, Saints, Feasts and Prayer'' by George Dion Dragas 2005 {{ISBN|0-9745618-0-0}} pp. 177\u2013178</ref><ref>''Butler's Lives of the Saints: August'' by Alban Butler, Paul Burns 1998 {{ISBN|0-86012-257-3}} p. 147</ref>\n\n==Galleries of Marian art==\n\n===[[Perpetual virginity]]===\n:''For a larger gallery, please see: [[Annunciation in Christian art]]\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"110px\" caption=\"Perpetual virginity\">\nImage:Anunciaci\u00f3n (Mariotto).jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Mariotto Albertinelli]], 15th century\nImage:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo 023.jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo|Murillo]], 1655\nFile:L' Annonciation de 1644, Philippe de Champaigne..jpg|[[Philippe de Champaigne]], 1644\nImage:Pietro Perugino cat23.jpg|''Annunciation'' by [[Pietro Perugino]], 1489\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens - Annunciation - WGA20250.jpg|[[Rubens]] ''Annunciation'' 1628 [[Antwerp]]\nImage:Sandro Botticelli 080.jpg|[[Cestello Annunciation (Botticelli)|''Cestello Annunciation'']] by [[Botticelli]], 1490\nFile:The Annunciation, by Francesco Albani.jpg|[[Francesco Albani]] ''Annunciation'' [[Hermitage Museum|The Hermitage]]\nFile:Annunciation nesterov.jpg|[[Mikhail Nesterov]], Russia, 19th century\n</gallery>\n\n===[[Nativity of Jesus|Birth of Jesus]]===\n::''For more images, please see'': [[Salome (disciple)#Gallery of art|Salome images]]\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"110px\" caption=\"Birth of Christ\">\nFile:Adoration of the Magi, ivory, 15th century, perhaps South German - Worcester Art Museum - IMG 7516.JPG|''Adoration of the Magi'', ivory, 15th century\nImage:Marten de vos Nativity.jpg|[[Marten de Vos]], 1577\nFile:Lorenzo Lotto 017.jpg|[[Lorenzo Lotto]], 1523\n<!-- Image:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|[[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]], 1490 -->\nFile:Pietro Perugino 015.jpg|[[Pietro Perugino]], 15th century\nImage:Birthofchristwithangelsberruguete.png|[[Pedro Berruguete]], 15th century\nFile:Giorgione 014.jpg|[[Giorgione]], c1507\nFile:Retablo del Nacimiento.

It also saw service in other military forces around the world. Most examples were retired by the mid-1990s. It is unique among MANPADS in that it is manually guided to its target with a small joystick, sending guidance corrections to the missile over a [[radio control]] link.\n\nBlowpipe underwent a protracted and controversial development between the program's initial conception in 1966 and 1975 when it finally entered service. It had its [[trial by ordeal|trial by fire]] in 1982's [[Falkland Islands War]] when it was used by both sides of the conflict. It demonstrated truly terrible performance, with only two confirmed kills for about 200 launches. A small number were also sent to the [[Mujahedeen]] in [[Afghanistan]], where its operators gave up on the weapon after twelve launches resulted in no hits.\n\nAs the poor performance of Blowpipe became obvious, an improved version offering semi-automatic guidance was introduced as [[Javelin surface-to-air missile|Javelin]]. This was further improved with a [[laser designator]] system in Javelin S15, which was later renamed [[Starburst (missile)|Starburst]]. Both Javelin systems were used only briefly before being replaced by the dramatically more powerful [[Starstreak (missile)|Starstreak]] in the 1990s.\n\nSeveral advanced variants and alternative launchers, including a submarine-based system, did not see production. Approximately 35,000 missiles were produced in total.\n\n==History==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of Blowpipe traces to a 1966 [[Ministry of Defense]] industry contract for a MANPADS system. Whether or not there was need of such a weapon was constantly debated, with the Secretary of State for Defence stating as late as 1968 that the question remained open. Ultimately, the decision was made in 1968 to start development of the Shorts proposal, which won the contract specifically because it was believed to be the least expensive option.<ref name=today>{{cite web |url=http://www.military-today.com/missiles/blowpipe.htm |title=Blowpipe |website=Military Today}}</ref>\n\nTo lower cost of the missile, Shorts' design did not include a guidance system. Instead, the guidance was on the launcher, which communicated with the missile using a [[radio command]] system. This meant the missile itself had few electronics in it, and the expensive systems were not expended when firing. Shorts, additionally, claimed that this system made it suitable for head-on engagements, while [[infrared homing]] systems of the era, like the [[FIM-43 Redeye]], were only useful in tail-chase engagements, where the missile's short range would make it almost useless.<ref name=today/>\n\nConcerns about the control fins at the front of the missile led to one of the distinguishing features of Blowpipe. It was considered to be a difficult problem to make movable control fins that also folded for storage{{efn|Shorts was not alone in this belief, early [[Sea Sparrow]] also retained fixed fins for the same reason.}} so the decision was made to have the guidance fins unfoldable. This required the forward section of the launcher to be large enough to hold them in their flight positions, which leads to the seemingly oversized cylinder at the front of the launcher. The rear fins, used for stabilization only, are placed at the rear of this cylinder on a separate ring, and the missile flies through it until they reach the end of the fuselage where the ring locks into place. As they exit the tube, the tips of the rear fins fold out further.<ref name=forecast>{{cite web |url=https://www.forecastinternational.com/archive/disp_old_pdf.cfm?ARC_ID=1073 |website=Forecast International |title=Blowpipe/Javelin |date=April 1999}}</ref>\n\nThe program immediately ran into problems. On 2 May 1969, MP [[Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet|Sir John Morris]] claimed that the Blowpipe's development was \"...proceeding satisfactorily but is at too early a stage for any firm production order.\" Two years later, on 11 February 1971, Minister of State [[Robert Lindsay, 29th Earl of Crawford|Robert Lindsay]] noted that \"The development programme for this missile continues to make progress although it will still be some time before it is completed.\" On 16 March 1972, Under-Secretary for Defence for the Army [[Geoffrey Johnson-Smith]] stated that Blowpipe \"...should be in service in about two years' time.\"<ref name=today/>\n\nA low-rate production contract was finally signed in September of that year. On 24 July 1973 it was stated that the system was still undergoing flight tests and ground tests,<ref name=today/> which were not officially completed until 1975. The missile entered service later that year.<ref name=forecast/> On 10 June 1976, further controversy sparked when it was revealed the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was reluctant to use the weapon in test launches because of its high cost, limiting training to only two launches per year. By 1979, only half the units slated to receive Blowpipe actually had them.<ref name=today/>\n\n===Variants===\nAfter requests from the Israeli and Brazilian navies for a [[submarine]]-launched weapon, Blowpipe was developed in a cluster of six missiles on a mast that could be raised from the submarine's [[conning tower]]. Known as \"Submarine Launched Airflight Missile\", or SLAM, the system was trialled on the WWII-era [[HMS Aeneas (P427)|HMS ''Aeneas'']] in 1972. These were for a time installed on Israeli [[Gal-class submarine|''Gal'' class]] submarines, but later removed.<ref name=forecast/> The Brazilians never installed the system.<ref name=today/>\n\nA four-round launcher similar to the one developed for SLAM was also considered for mounting on the [[M113]] and [[FV103 Spartan]], but it is unclear if either reached trials.<ref name=forecast/> The programs were officially ended in June 1981. The basic concept was later re-introduced as the three-round \"Lightweight Multiple Launchers\" (LML) for Blowpipe or Javelin. A larger five-round mount was later offered as \"Sea Javelin\".<ref name=forecast/>\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Northrop Grumman|Northrop]] introduced a new MANPADS combining the Blowpipe missile with a [[semi-active laser guidance]] system into the competition that was ultimately won by the [[Raytheon]] [[FIM-92 Stinger]].<ref name=forecast/> This was the guidance system that was ultimately used by Starburst.\n\n==Description==\nThe missile is supplied as a single round in a storage cylinder/firing tube. The aiming unit is clipped to the launch tube and fired from the [[Shoulder-fired missile|operator's shoulder]]. To reduce the overall size of the container, the rear fins of the missile are stored in the larger diameter cylinder at the front of the tube (this also contains the [[Yagi antenna]] for transmitting guidance signals); during firing, the fins slip onto the rear of the missile as it flies through and are held there by heat-activated adhesive tapes. This gives the launch container a unique shape, seemingly oversized at the front and extremely thin at the rear. The missile is powered by a short duration [[solid rocket]] for launch, then by a sustainer motor once it is well clear of the launch tube.<ref name=forecast/>\n\nThe Blowpipe's [[Guidance system|guidance]] is initially semi-automatic with the missile gathered to the centre of the sight's crosshairs by the [[infrared]] optic atop the aiming unit. Two to three seconds after launch, missile guidance is switched to fully [[MCLOS]] mode, and the operator regains full control of the missile. The operator has to steer the missile all the way to its target manually via a small [[thumb]] [[joystick]]. The operator can opt not to use auto-gathering when engaging low flying targets such as helicopters, but then has to super-elevate the launcher to ensure that the missile does not hit the ground. Four [[flares]] in the tail of the missile make it visible in flight, first to the infrared optic, then to the operator. Detonation is either by [[Proximity fuze|proximity]] or [[contact fuse]]. In emergencies, the operator can end an engagement by shutting off the power to the transmitter with the system switch, after which the missile will immediately self-destruct. The aiming unit can then be removed from the empty missile container and fitted to a new round.<ref name=forecast/>\n\n==Combat performance==\nBlowpipe was used by both sides during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. With the targets being fast flying aircraft, flying low and using the ground to hide their approach, the Blowpipe operator had about 20 seconds to spot the target, align the unit and fire. Brigadier [[Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)|Julian Thompson]] compared using the weapon to \"trying to shoot [[pheasants]] with a drainpipe\". The official report stated that, of the 95 missiles fired by the British, only 9 managed to destroy their targets and all of these were slow flying planes and helicopters.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj89/sum89/hillson.html |title=BARRAGE BALLOONS FOR LOW-LEVEL AIR DEFENSE |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812023821/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj89/sum89/hillson.html# |archive-date=2007-08-12 |magazine=Air & Space Power Journal |date= Summer 1989}}</ref> A later report determined that only two kills could be attributed to Blowpipe: A British Harrier GR3 (XZ972) attacked by Argentine Army special forces (Commandos Company), and an Argentine [[Aermacchi MB-339]] (0766 (4-A-114)) during the [[Battle of Goose Green]].<ref>Freedman, Sir Lawrence, ''The Official History of the Falklands Campaign'' (Abingdon, 2005). Volume II, pages 732\u2013735</ref>\n\nBlowpipe was found to be particularly ineffective when used to engage a crossing target or to chase a target moving rapidly away from the operator. Its poor performance led to it being withdrawn from British service. In 1986, some of the mothballed units were sent [[Secrecy|clandestinely]] to equip the [[Mujahideen]] fighting the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] in [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmyk.info/markcurtis/print1b.html |title=''Web of Deceit'', Mark Curtis, Chronology |access-date=2005-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515030601/http://www.cmyk.info/markcurtis/print1b.html |archive-date=2011-05-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The system again proved ineffective,<ref>[http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/zhawar/zhawar.htm ''The Campaign for the Caves: The battles for Zhawar'', Lester W.

A computer in the missile launcher calculates the difference between the current aim spot and the missile's location, and sends commands to the missile via radio to bring it to an impact point.<ref name=forecast/>\n\nThe basic Javelin missile body was retained in the upgraded Javelin S15, which replaced the original's radio command guidance system with a semi-automatic laser system. This uses a [[laser]] in the launcher to \"paint\" the target, and a seeker in the missile nose cone sees the reflected signal and homes in on it. This renders it largely immune to any possible jamming. S15 was better known as [[Starburst (missile)|Starburst]], although it was known by a variety of names in service.<ref name=forecast/>\n\nStarburst was used only briefly, before being replaced by [[Starstreak]]. Starstreak uses the same [[beam-riding]] concept as Starburst, but dramatically improves the missile and warhead.

It also saw service in other military forces around the world. Most examples were retired by the mid-1990s. It is unique among MANPADS in that it is manually guided to its target with a small joystick, sending guidance corrections to the missile over a [[radio control]] link.\n\nBlowpipe underwent a protracted and controversial development between the program's initial conception in 1966 and 1975 when it finally entered service. It had its [[trial by ordeal|trial by fire]] in 1982's [[Falkland Islands War]] when it was used by both sides of the conflict. It demonstrated truly terrible performance, with only two confirmed kills for about 200 launches. A small number were also sent to the [[Mujahedeen]] in [[Afghanistan]], where its operators gave up on the weapon after twelve launches resulted in no hits.\n\nAs the poor performance of Blowpipe became obvious, an improved version offering semi-automatic guidance was introduced as [[Javelin surface-to-air missile|Javelin]]. This was further improved with a [[laser designator]] system in Javelin S15, which was later renamed [[Starburst (missile)|Starburst]]. Both Javelin systems were used only briefly before being replaced by the dramatically more powerful [[Starstreak (missile)|Starstreak]] in the 1990s.\n\nSeveral advanced variants and alternative launchers, including a submarine-based system, did not see production. Approximately 35,000 missiles were produced in total.\n\n==History==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of Blowpipe traces to a 1966 [[Ministry of Defense]] industry contract for a MANPADS system. Whether or not there was need of such a weapon was constantly debated, with the Secretary of State for Defence stating as late as 1968 that the question remained open. Ultimately, the decision was made in 1968 to start development of the Shorts proposal, which won the contract specifically because it was believed to be the least expensive option.<ref name=today>{{cite web |url=http://www.military-today.com/missiles/blowpipe.htm |title=Blowpipe |website=Military Today}}</ref>\n\nTo lower cost of the missile, Shorts' design did not include a guidance system. Instead, the guidance was on the launcher, which communicated with the missile using a [[radio command]] system. This meant the missile itself had few electronics in it, and the expensive systems were not expended when firing. Shorts, additionally, claimed that this system made it suitable for head-on engagements, while [[infrared homing]] systems of the era, like the [[FIM-43 Redeye]], were only useful in tail-chase engagements, where the missile's short range would make it almost useless.<ref name=today/>\n\nConcerns about the control fins at the front of the missile led to one of the distinguishing features of Blowpipe. It was considered to be a difficult problem to make movable control fins that also folded for storage{{efn|Shorts was not alone in this belief, early [[Sea Sparrow]] also retained fixed fins for the same reason.}} so the decision was made to have the guidance fins unfoldable. This required the forward section of the launcher to be large enough to hold them in their flight positions, which leads to the seemingly oversized cylinder at the front of the launcher. The rear fins, used for stabilization only, are placed at the rear of this cylinder on a separate ring, and the missile flies through it until they reach the end of the fuselage where the ring locks into place. As they exit the tube, the tips of the rear fins fold out further.<ref name=forecast>{{cite web |url=https://www.forecastinternational.com/archive/disp_old_pdf.cfm?ARC_ID=1073 |website=Forecast International |title=Blowpipe/Javelin |date=April 1999}}</ref>\n\nThe program immediately ran into problems. On 2 May 1969, MP [[Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet|Sir John Morris]] claimed that the Blowpipe's development was \"...proceeding satisfactorily but is at too early a stage for any firm production order.\" Two years later, on 11 February 1971, Minister of State [[Robert Lindsay, 29th Earl of Crawford|Robert Lindsay]] noted that \"The development programme for this missile continues to make progress although it will still be some time before it is completed.\" On 16 March 1972, Under-Secretary for Defence for the Army [[Geoffrey Johnson-Smith]] stated that Blowpipe \"...should be in service in about two years' time.\"<ref name=today/>\n\nA low-rate production contract was finally signed in September of that year. On 24 July 1973 it was stated that the system was still undergoing flight tests and ground tests,<ref name=today/> which were not officially completed until 1975. The missile entered service later that year.<ref name=forecast/> On 10 June 1976, further controversy sparked when it was revealed the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was reluctant to use the weapon in test launches because of its high cost, limiting training to only two launches per year. By 1979, only half the units slated to receive Blowpipe actually had them.<ref name=today/>\n\n===Variants===\nAfter requests from the Israeli and Brazilian navies for a [[submarine]]-launched weapon, Blowpipe was developed in a cluster of six missiles on a mast that could be raised from the submarine's [[conning tower]]. Known as \"Submarine Launched Airflight Missile\", or SLAM, the system was trialled on the WWII-era [[HMS Aeneas (P427)|HMS ''Aeneas'']] in 1972. These were for a time installed on Israeli [[Gal-class submarine|''Gal'' class]] submarines, but later removed.<ref name=forecast/> The Brazilians never installed the system.<ref name=today/>\n\nA four-round launcher similar to the one developed for SLAM was also considered for mounting on the [[M113]] and [[FV103 Spartan]], but it is unclear if either reached trials.<ref name=forecast/> The programs were officially ended in June 1981. The basic concept was later re-introduced as the three-round \"Lightweight Multiple Launchers\" (LML) for Blowpipe or Javelin. A larger five-round mount was later offered as \"Sea Javelin\".<ref name=forecast/>\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Northrop Grumman|Northrop]] introduced a new MANPADS combining the Blowpipe missile with a [[semi-active laser guidance]] system into the competition that was ultimately won by the [[Raytheon]] [[FIM-92 Stinger]].<ref name=forecast/> This was the guidance system that was ultimately used by Starburst.\n\n==Description==\nThe missile is supplied as a single round in a storage cylinder/firing tube. The aiming unit is clipped to the launch tube and fired from the [[Shoulder-fired missile|operator's shoulder]]. To reduce the overall size of the container, the rear fins of the missile are stored in the larger diameter cylinder at the front of the tube (this also contains the [[Yagi antenna]] for transmitting guidance signals); during firing, the fins slip onto the rear of the missile as it flies through and are held there by heat-activated adhesive tapes. This gives the launch container a unique shape, seemingly oversized at the front and extremely thin at the rear. The missile is powered by a short duration [[solid rocket]] for launch, then by a sustainer motor once it is well clear of the launch tube.<ref name=forecast/>\n\nThe Blowpipe's [[Guidance system|guidance]] is initially semi-automatic with the missile gathered to the centre of the sight's crosshairs by the [[infrared]] optic atop the aiming unit. Two to three seconds after launch, missile guidance is switched to fully [[MCLOS]] mode, and the operator regains full control of the missile. The operator has to steer the missile all the way to its target manually via a small [[thumb]] [[joystick]]. The operator can opt not to use auto-gathering when engaging low flying targets such as helicopters, but then has to super-elevate the launcher to ensure that the missile does not hit the ground. Four [[flares]] in the tail of the missile make it visible in flight, first to the infrared optic, then to the operator. Detonation is either by [[Proximity fuze|proximity]] or [[contact fuse]]. In emergencies, the operator can end an engagement by shutting off the power to the transmitter with the system switch, after which the missile will immediately self-destruct. The aiming unit can then be removed from the empty missile container and fitted to a new round.<ref name=forecast/>\n\n==Combat performance==\nBlowpipe was used by both sides during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. With the targets being fast flying aircraft, flying low and using the ground to hide their approach, the Blowpipe operator had about 20 seconds to spot the target, align the unit and fire. Brigadier [[Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)|Julian Thompson]] compared using the weapon to \"trying to shoot [[pheasants]] with a drainpipe\". The official report stated that, of the 95 missiles fired by the British, only 9 managed to destroy their targets and all of these were slow flying planes and helicopters.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj89/sum89/hillson.html |title=BARRAGE BALLOONS FOR LOW-LEVEL AIR DEFENSE |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812023821/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj89/sum89/hillson.html# |archive-date=2007-08-12 |magazine=Air & Space Power Journal |date= Summer 1989}}</ref> A later report determined that only two kills could be attributed to Blowpipe: A British Harrier GR3 (XZ972) attacked by Argentine Army special forces (Commandos Company), and an Argentine [[Aermacchi MB-339]] (0766 (4-A-114)) during the [[Battle of Goose Green]].<ref>Freedman, Sir Lawrence, ''The Official History of the Falklands Campaign'' (Abingdon, 2005). Volume II, pages 732\u2013735</ref>\n\nBlowpipe was found to be particularly ineffective when used to engage a crossing target or to chase a target moving rapidly away from the operator. Its poor performance led to it being withdrawn from British service. In 1986, some of the mothballed units were sent [[Secrecy|clandestinely]] to equip the [[Mujahideen]] fighting the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] in [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmyk.info/markcurtis/print1b.html |title=''Web of Deceit'', Mark Curtis, Chronology |access-date=2005-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515030601/http://www.cmyk.info/markcurtis/print1b.html |archive-date=2011-05-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The system again proved ineffective,<ref>[http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/zhawar/zhawar.htm ''The Campaign for the Caves: The battles for Zhawar'', Lester W.

A computer in the missile launcher calculates the difference between the current aim spot and the missile's location, and sends commands to the missile via radio to bring it to an impact point.<ref name=forecast/>\n\nThe basic Javelin missile body was retained in the upgraded Javelin S15, which replaced the original's radio command guidance system with a semi-automatic laser system. This uses a [[laser]] in the launcher to \"paint\" the target, and a seeker in the missile nose cone sees the reflected signal and homes in on it. This renders it largely immune to any possible jamming. S15 was better known as [[Starburst (missile)|Starburst]], although it was known by a variety of names in service.<ref name=forecast/>\n\nStarburst was used only briefly, before being replaced by [[Starstreak]]. Starstreak uses the same [[beam-riding]] concept as Starburst, but dramatically improves the missile and warhead.

After attending [[Agoura High School]] in [[Agoura Hills, California]], Matthews was a [[walk-on (sports)|walk-on]] [[student athlete]] at the [[University of Southern California]] for the [[USC Trojans football]] team under head coach [[Pete Carroll]]. At USC, Matthews was a standout [[special-teams]] player, winning three consecutive Special Teams Player of the Year awards from 2006 to 2008. He also played reserve outside linebacker during those years before moving into a starting role his senior season. During his college career, he was a part of three [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10 Championship]] teams.\n \nMatthews was considered a top prospect for the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. He was ultimately selected by the [[Green Bay Packers]] in the first round of the draft (26th overall) after the team traded up to make the selection. In his rookie year, Matthews recorded 10 [[quarterback sacks|sacks]] while playing outside linebacker. He topped that total in 2010 with 13.5 sacks, helping the Packers to their [[Super Bowl XLV]] victory against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Matthews continued his role as a leading pass rusher, recording at least six sacks in the first nine seasons he played. He also has showed his athleticism and abilities by playing both [[inside linebacker|inside]] and [[outside linebacker]] during the [[2014 Green Bay Packers season|2014]] and [[2015 Green Bay Packers season|2015]] seasons.\n\nA member of the [[Matthews family]] of football players, he is the son of former NFL linebacker [[Clay Matthews Jr.]] and nephew of [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] offensive lineman [[Bruce Matthews (American football)|Bruce Matthews]].\n\n==Early life==\nMatthews was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Leslie and [[Clay Matthews Jr.]], a professional [[American football|football]] player. The family has a history of professional football players. Matthews's grandfather was [[Clay Matthews Sr.]] His brother is linebacker [[Casey Matthews]], and his uncle is [[Bruce Matthews (American football)|Bruce Matthews]]. Both brothers were [[All-American]]s in their time in college.

Physically, Matthews was a [[late bloomer]]. His father was the team's [[defensive coordinator]], but declined to start his son because he was physically undersized.

Though he was the son of an All-Pro NFL linebacker, he entered USC as an unheralded, walk-on [[student athlete]]. During his first season, USC's [[2004 USC Trojans football team|2004 BCS National Championship]], he played only on the [[scout team]] and turned down several playing opportunities during [[garbage time]] during the fourth quarters of games to preserve his [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] status and remaining seasons of NCAA eligibility. He remained a nonathletic scholarship (a \"walk on\") reserve linebacker during the [[2005 USC Trojans football team|2005 season]], and played mainly on [[special teams]]. He was granted full [[athletic scholarship]] status at the beginning of the [[2006 USC Trojans football team|2006 season]].

At the beginning of the [[2008 USC Trojans football team|2008 season]], defensive coordinator [[Nick Holt]], Carroll, and Norton decided to try using Matthews in a hybrid \"elephant\" position, where Matthews would stand in the position of [[defensive end]], but use the speed and tactics of a linebacker; the coaches had used Cushing in the position in a similar manner in 2006.<ref name=\"LAT092308\"/> The experiment was successful, as Matthews recorded 4.5 sacks while playing alongside his other [[NFL]]-bound teammates Brian Cushing, [[Rey Maualuga]], and [[Kaluka Maiava]]. Furthermore, Matthews continued his spectacular special-teams play and was awarded USC's Co-Special Teams Player of the Year in 2008, making him the only player in USC history to be awarded three consecutive Special Teams Player of the Year awards.

After seeing him double-teamed and constantly chipped by running backs in the NFC wild card game against the [[2010 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]], Dom Capers decided to move him around the field. Matthews eventually ended up playing mostly at LOLB, but he would roam around the field, playing also at the ROLB position and sometimes in the middle. He finished the season with 60 tackles, 13.5 sacks (fourth in the league), four pass deflections, two forced fumbles, and an interception through 15 games in 2010. He became the first Packer to record six sacks in the first two games of the season and had 8.5 sacks in the first five weeks, but slowed down the latter part of the season (five sacks in the last 10 games due to a stress fracture in his lower leg). Matthews was named to the [[2011 Pro Bowl]] NFC roster for the second straight year and was named to the All-Pro team for the first time in his career. Matthews was awarded with the NFL's defensive player of the month award for September after recording six sacks in the first two weeks of the 2010 season. Matthews recorded a career-high 55.0 quarterback pressures. He was named SN-NFL Defensive Player of the Year and NFC Defensive Player of the Year, and won the [[Butkus Award]]. He finished a close second (17 votes to 15) to [[Troy Polamalu]] in the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] voting, notable in that both led their defenses to [[Super Bowl XLV]].\n\nHe set the Packers' record for most sacks in a single postseason with 3.5. In the Super Bowl, won by the Packers over the [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], he recorded three tackles, a pass deflection, and a game-changing forced fumble. On the first play of the fourth quarter with the Steelers driving to take the lead with the score 21\u201317 in favor of Green Bay and the ball on the Packer 33 yard line, he tackled Steelers running back [[Rashard Mendenhall]], who fumbled the ball, recovered by [[Desmond Bishop]]. The Packers never lost the lead, winning their fourth [[Super Bowl]] title and first since [[Super Bowl XXXI]], 31\u201325.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201102060pit.htm |title=Super Bowl XLV \u2013 Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Green Bay Packers \u2013 February 6th, 2011 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====2011 season====\nMatthews finished the 2011 season with 50 tackles, and a career low six sacks despite playing 15 of the 16 games. He led the Packers in quarterback pressures for the third straight season, with 53.5. Although some of his numbers plummeted from the previous season, he improved in other aspects of his game. He recorded a career-high three interceptions, nine pass deflections, and three forced fumbles. He also recorded his third career defensive touchdown by picking off [[Eli Manning]] for a pick-six. Matthews played almost exclusively at the LOLB position, not roaming around the field like he did the previous season due to the struggling defense. Matthews did not play a single snap at the ROLB position until Week 11 and finished the entire season with only seven rushes from the ROLB spot. Matthews claimed he had his best overall season despite the low numbers. The Packers struggled to find pass pressure from the side opposite of Matthews and the loss of defensive end [[Cullen Jenkins]] due to [[free agent|free agency]] and safety [[Nick Collins]] due to a career-ending neck injury, placed the Packers last in total defense despite leading the league in interceptions, with 31. Linebacker coach Kevin Greene stated that he has never seen a pass rusher get double teamed as much as Clay had that season. The defensive line struggled, finishing the season with six total sacks after recording 18 the year before. Matthews was named to his third-straight Pro Bowl as a starter. Prior to the 2011 season, Matthews was named the second-best pass rusher (second only to [[DeMarcus Ware]]) and the fourth-best linebacker in the league by ESPN (behind [[Patrick Willis]], [[James Harrison (American football)|James Harrison]], and Ware).\n\n====2012 season====\nHeading into the 2012 season, the defense needed to improve. Finishing with the 32nd-ranked defense in the NFL was described by Matthews as \"unacceptable.\" The Packers picked six straight defensive players in the draft, including Matthews's former teammate, [[Nick Perry (American football)|Nick Perry]], out of USC. Because of Perry's larger size (10 pounds heavier) and not being accustomed to playing pass coverage, he was put at the LOLB position, and Matthews was moved back to the ROLB position he played at in his rookie year. The Packers hoped that by drafting Perry, as well as [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] DE [[Jerel Worthy]] and [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] DE [[Mike Daniels (American football)|Mike Daniels]], opposing teams would no longer be able to consistently double-team Matthews, allowing pressure to open up on all sides.\n\n[[File:2012 Packers vs Giants - Clay Matthews 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Matthews playing against the [[New York Giants]] in 2012|alt=A picture of Clay Matthews in uniform on the field with his hands in the area, presumably to pump up the home-team crowd]]\n\nPrior to the 2012 season, ''[[Sporting News]]'' ranked Matthews as the second-best outside linebacker in the league, only behind Cowboys' star [[DeMarcus Ware]]. Matthews started out the season with a bang. He recorded 2.5 sacks in the 30\u201322 season opener loss to the eventual NFC champion [[2012 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] and then posted a career-high 3.5 sacks against the [[2012 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] on Thursday night. Matthews became one of only six players in NFL history to record six or more sacks in the first two games of the season, and is the only player ever to do it twice. Entering Week 9 against the [[2012 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]], he was second in the league in sacks with nine. Matthews had to leave the game in the second half after his left hamstring started to tighten up. He was eventually ruled out for weeks 11 through 13. After missing four straight games with the hamstring injury, Matthews recorded six tackles, two sacks, and a pass deflection in a 21\u201313 victory over the Chicago Bears. This victory crowned the Packers as [[NFC North]] champions for the second year in a row. Matthews totaled three tackles and a sack in a 37\u201334 season ending loss to the [[2012 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]. He finished the season with 43 tackles, 13.0 sacks (fifth in the league), two passes defended, and a forced fumble. Matthews was selected to his fourth straight Pro Bowl, but dropped out due to injury, and was named to the All-Pro team for the second time.\n\nIn the off-season, Matthews became the highest-paid linebacker in NFL history when the Packers and he made a deal worth $66 million over the next five seasons.\n\n====2013 season====\nPlaying in only 11 games during the 2013 season, Matthews recorded 41 tackles (26 solo), a team-high 7.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles. During the Packers' Week 5 matchup with the Detroit Lions on October 6, 2013, Matthews broke his right thumb and missed the next four games. On November 10, in a game at home against the [[2013 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], he returned to the playing field, donning a large \"club\" cast over his entire right hand. Without the ability to use his fingers to grab or apply pressure or leverage, Matthews was left to be fairly ineffective during this game.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.packers.com/news/clay-matthews-is-done-with-the-club-11836701| website= Packers.com| title= Clay Matthews is done with the club| date= November 14, 2013| first= Mike |last= Spofford| access-date= August 27, 2016}}</ref> The following week, he returned to the field with a less restrictive device that allowed his fingers to remain free. The device seemed to improve his performance the following week. After completing only two tackles (one solo) with no sacks, stuffs, hits, or hurries on the quarterback against the Philadelphia Eagles, in the Packers' Week 11 match-up against the [[2013 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] the following week, Matthews had four tackles, including a sack and stuff with the less restrictive device.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/12438/clay-matthews| title= Clay Matthews Game-by-Game Stats| publisher= ESPN| date= | access-date= August 27, 2016}}</ref> After the Giants game, Matthews went on to accumulate 4.5 more sacks and 17 tackles (10 solo) over the next five weeks. In Week 16, during the second to last game of the regular season against the [[2013 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], Matthews refractured his thumb and was out for the remainder of the season.\n\n====2014 season====\nPrior to the 2014 season, the Packers signed veteran free agent [[Julius Peppers]] to bring an additional pass rush to help Matthews. After a Week 8 loss to the [[2014 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], where the Packers defense gave up almost 500 yards of offense, including 172 yards rushing from Mark Ingram, Packers defensive coordinator Dom Capers and head coach Mike McCarthy decided to alter Matthews's position, alternating him between outside linebacker and middle linebacker during games, depending on the play call. The move paid huge dividends for both Matthews and the Packers defense, as the defense improved drastically over the final eight games of the season. After spending the first half of the season ranked near the bottom in the league in defense, the Packers finished the season ranked a respectable 14th in the NFL in total defense. Matthews's sack numbers also increased in the second half of the season. After only getting 2.5 sacks in the first eight games, Matthews had 8.5 sacks in the final eight games, including back-to-back two-sack games against the [[2014 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] and [[2014 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Matthews finished the season with 11 sacks, 9 passes defended, one interception (his first since 2011), and two forced fumbles. For the first time in his NFL career, Matthews started every game during the regular season.\n\n====2015 season====\n[[File:Clay Matthews entering the stadium Cropped.jpg|thumb|Matthews entering [[Lambeau Field]] before a game in October 2015]]\nMatthews helped lead his team to the NFC Divisional Round playoff game against the [[2015 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]], a game that it lost 26\u201320 in overtime.

After attending [[Agoura High School]] in [[Agoura Hills, California]], Matthews was a [[walk-on (sports)|walk-on]] [[student athlete]] at the [[University of Southern California]] for the [[USC Trojans football]] team under head coach [[Pete Carroll]]. At USC, Matthews was a standout [[special-teams]] player, winning three consecutive Special Teams Player of the Year awards from 2006 to 2008. He also played reserve outside linebacker during those years before moving into a starting role his senior season. During his college career, he was a part of three [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10 Championship]] teams.\n \nMatthews was considered a top prospect for the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. He was ultimately selected by the [[Green Bay Packers]] in the first round of the draft (26th overall) after the team traded up to make the selection. In his rookie year, Matthews recorded 10 [[quarterback sacks|sacks]] while playing outside linebacker. He topped that total in 2010 with 13.5 sacks, helping the Packers to their [[Super Bowl XLV]] victory against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Matthews continued his role as a leading pass rusher, recording at least six sacks in the first nine seasons he played. He also has showed his athleticism and abilities by playing both [[inside linebacker|inside]] and [[outside linebacker]] during the [[2014 Green Bay Packers season|2014]] and [[2015 Green Bay Packers season|2015]] seasons.\n\nA member of the [[Matthews family]] of football players, he is the son of former NFL linebacker [[Clay Matthews Jr.]] and nephew of [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] offensive lineman [[Bruce Matthews (American football)|Bruce Matthews]].\n\n==Early life==\nMatthews was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Leslie and [[Clay Matthews Jr.]], a professional [[American football|football]] player. The family has a history of professional football players. Matthews's grandfather was [[Clay Matthews Sr.]] His brother is linebacker [[Casey Matthews]], and his uncle is [[Bruce Matthews (American football)|Bruce Matthews]]. Both brothers were [[All-American]]s in their time in college. He also has cousins involved in football: [[Kevin Matthews (American football)|Kevin Matthews]], [[Jake Matthews (American football)|Jake Matthews]], and Mike Matthews.\n\n==High school career==\nMatthews attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, where he played for the Agoura Chargers [[high school football]] team. Physically, Matthews was a [[late bloomer]]. His father was the team's [[defensive coordinator]], but declined to start his son because he was physically undersized. Matthews began developing physically in his senior season, but only garnered interest from Division I [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] schools and local [[community colleges]].<ref name=\"LAT092308\">{{Citation| last = Klein| first = Gary| title = Clay's feat: walk on, hold off, move up| newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]]| date = September 23, 2008| accessdate = July 12, 2016 | url = https://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/23/sports/sp-usc23}}</ref> He has described his own recruiting status out of high school as \"not applicable.\"<ref name=\"NYT110208\">{{Cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcwest/post/_/id/35956/power-rankings-top-10-nfl-linebackers |title=Power Rankings: Top 10 NFL linebackers |work=espn |date=November 2, 2008 |accessdate=December 4, 2012 }}</ref> Like his father and uncle, Matthews opted to attend the [[University of Southern California]] with hopes of becoming a [[Walk-on (sports)|walk-on]] for the Trojans football team.\n\n==College career==\n[[File:2007-1020-ClayMatthewsIII.jpg|thumb|alt=Matthews during his 2007 season at USC|A college-age picture of Clay Matthews III, standing in a crowd of USC fans]]\n\nMatthews attended the University of Southern California and played for the Trojans from 2004 to 2008 under [[head coach]] [[Pete Carroll]].

He remained a nonathletic scholarship (a \"walk on\") reserve linebacker during the [[2005 USC Trojans football team|2005 season]], and played mainly on [[special teams]]. He was granted full [[athletic scholarship]] status at the beginning of the [[2006 USC Trojans football team|2006 season]]. Matthews continued to play reserve linebacker in the 2006 and [[2007 USC Trojans football team|2007 season]]s, and made two starts in 2007 in place of injured teammate [[Brian Cushing]].<ref name=\"LAT092308\"/> He was awarded USC's Co-Special Teams Player of the Year in 2006 and 2007 and blocked two field goals in the latter season.<ref name=WeAreSC050408>{{cite web |first=Erik |last=McKinney |url=http://wearesc.com/news/story.php?article=1011 |title=A Spot for Clay |website=WeAreSC.com |date=May 4, 2008 |access-date=January 29, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430081520/http://wearesc.com/news/story.php?article=1011 |archivedate=April 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring the off season, Matthews committed to weight training and conditioning programs to gain size and improve his performance level and stamina. At the beginning of the [[2008 USC Trojans football team|2008 season]], defensive coordinator [[Nick Holt]], Carroll, and Norton decided to try using Matthews in a hybrid \"elephant\" position, where Matthews would stand in the position of [[defensive end]], but use the speed and tactics of a linebacker; the coaches had used Cushing in the position in a similar manner in 2006.<ref name=\"LAT092308\"/> The experiment was successful, as Matthews recorded 4.5 sacks while playing alongside his other [[NFL]]-bound teammates Brian Cushing, [[Rey Maualuga]], and [[Kaluka Maiava]]. Furthermore, Matthews continued his spectacular special-teams play and was awarded USC's Co-Special Teams Player of the Year in 2008, making him the only player in USC history to be awarded three consecutive Special Teams Player of the Year awards.

He played in all 16 games, starting at ROLB in 13 of them. He led the Packers in QB pressures, with 45.5. He finished third for the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, losing to his former USC teammate Brian Cushing. He was named NFC Defensive Rookie of the Year and set the Packer record for most sacks in a season by a rookie, with 10.0.\n\n[[File:2012 Packers vs Giants - Clay Matthews.jpg|thumb|upright|Matthews during the January 15, 2012 game against the [[New York Giants]]|alt=A photo of Clay Matthews III in uniform on the field waiting for the play to begin]]\n\n====2010 season====\nMatthews took a different approach to the game in the 2010 season. After seeing him double-teamed and constantly chipped by running backs in the NFC wild card game against the [[2010 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]], Dom Capers decided to move him around the field. Matthews eventually ended up playing mostly at LOLB, but he would roam around the field, playing also at the ROLB position and sometimes in the middle. He finished the season with 60 tackles, 13.5 sacks (fourth in the league), four pass deflections, two forced fumbles, and an interception through 15 games in 2010. He became the first Packer to record six sacks in the first two games of the season and had 8.5 sacks in the first five weeks, but slowed down the latter part of the season (five sacks in the last 10 games due to a stress fracture in his lower leg). Matthews was named to the [[2011 Pro Bowl]] NFC roster for the second straight year and was named to the All-Pro team for the first time in his career. Matthews was awarded with the NFL's defensive player of the month award for September after recording six sacks in the first two weeks of the 2010 season. Matthews recorded a career-high 55.0 quarterback pressures. He was named SN-NFL Defensive Player of the Year and NFC Defensive Player of the Year, and won the [[Butkus Award]]. He finished a close second (17 votes to 15) to [[Troy Polamalu]] in the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] voting, notable in that both led their defenses to [[Super Bowl XLV]].\n\nHe set the Packers' record for most sacks in a single postseason with 3.5. In the Super Bowl, won by the Packers over the [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], he recorded three tackles, a pass deflection, and a game-changing forced fumble. On the first play of the fourth quarter with the Steelers driving to take the lead with the score 21\u201317 in favor of Green Bay and the ball on the Packer 33 yard line, he tackled Steelers running back [[Rashard Mendenhall]], who fumbled the ball, recovered by [[Desmond Bishop]]. The Packers never lost the lead, winning their fourth [[Super Bowl]] title and first since [[Super Bowl XXXI]], 31\u201325.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201102060pit.htm |title=Super Bowl XLV \u2013 Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Green Bay Packers \u2013 February 6th, 2011 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====2011 season====\nMatthews finished the 2011 season with 50 tackles, and a career low six sacks despite playing 15 of the 16 games. He led the Packers in quarterback pressures for the third straight season, with 53.5. Although some of his numbers plummeted from the previous season, he improved in other aspects of his game. He recorded a career-high three interceptions, nine pass deflections, and three forced fumbles. He also recorded his third career defensive touchdown by picking off [[Eli Manning]] for a pick-six. Matthews played almost exclusively at the LOLB position, not roaming around the field like he did the previous season due to the struggling defense. Matthews did not play a single snap at the ROLB position until Week 11 and finished the entire season with only seven rushes from the ROLB spot. Matthews claimed he had his best overall season despite the low numbers. The Packers struggled to find pass pressure from the side opposite of Matthews and the loss of defensive end [[Cullen Jenkins]] due to [[free agent|free agency]] and safety [[Nick Collins]] due to a career-ending neck injury, placed the Packers last in total defense despite leading the league in interceptions, with 31. Linebacker coach Kevin Greene stated that he has never seen a pass rusher get double teamed as much as Clay had that season. The defensive line struggled, finishing the season with six total sacks after recording 18 the year before. Matthews was named to his third-straight Pro Bowl as a starter. Prior to the 2011 season, Matthews was named the second-best pass rusher (second only to [[DeMarcus Ware]]) and the fourth-best linebacker in the league by ESPN (behind [[Patrick Willis]], [[James Harrison (American football)|James Harrison]], and Ware).\n\n====2012 season====\nHeading into the 2012 season, the defense needed to improve. Finishing with the 32nd-ranked defense in the NFL was described by Matthews as \"unacceptable.\" The Packers picked six straight defensive players in the draft, including Matthews's former teammate, [[Nick Perry (American football)|Nick Perry]], out of USC. Because of Perry's larger size (10 pounds heavier) and not being accustomed to playing pass coverage, he was put at the LOLB position, and Matthews was moved back to the ROLB position he played at in his rookie year. The Packers hoped that by drafting Perry, as well as [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] DE [[Jerel Worthy]] and [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] DE [[Mike Daniels (American football)|Mike Daniels]], opposing teams would no longer be able to consistently double-team Matthews, allowing pressure to open up on all sides.\n\n[[File:2012 Packers vs Giants - Clay Matthews 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Matthews playing against the [[New York Giants]] in 2012|alt=A picture of Clay Matthews in uniform on the field with his hands in the area, presumably to pump up the home-team crowd]]\n\nPrior to the 2012 season, ''[[Sporting News]]'' ranked Matthews as the second-best outside linebacker in the league, only behind Cowboys' star [[DeMarcus Ware]]. Matthews started out the season with a bang. He recorded 2.5 sacks in the 30\u201322 season opener loss to the eventual NFC champion [[2012 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] and then posted a career-high 3.5 sacks against the [[2012 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] on Thursday night. Matthews became one of only six players in NFL history to record six or more sacks in the first two games of the season, and is the only player ever to do it twice. Entering Week 9 against the [[2012 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]], he was second in the league in sacks with nine. Matthews had to leave the game in the second half after his left hamstring started to tighten up. He was eventually ruled out for weeks 11 through 13. After missing four straight games with the hamstring injury, Matthews recorded six tackles, two sacks, and a pass deflection in a 21\u201313 victory over the Chicago Bears. This victory crowned the Packers as [[NFC North]] champions for the second year in a row. Matthews totaled three tackles and a sack in a 37\u201334 season ending loss to the [[2012 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]. He finished the season with 43 tackles, 13.0 sacks (fifth in the league), two passes defended, and a forced fumble. Matthews was selected to his fourth straight Pro Bowl, but dropped out due to injury, and was named to the All-Pro team for the second time.\n\nIn the off-season, Matthews became the highest-paid linebacker in NFL history when the Packers and he made a deal worth $66 million over the next five seasons.\n\n====2013 season====\nPlaying in only 11 games during the 2013 season, Matthews recorded 41 tackles (26 solo), a team-high 7.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles. During the Packers' Week 5 matchup with the Detroit Lions on October 6, 2013, Matthews broke his right thumb and missed the next four games. On November 10, in a game at home against the [[2013 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], he returned to the playing field, donning a large \"club\" cast over his entire right hand. Without the ability to use his fingers to grab or apply pressure or leverage, Matthews was left to be fairly ineffective during this game.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.packers.com/news/clay-matthews-is-done-with-the-club-11836701| website= Packers.com| title= Clay Matthews is done with the club| date= November 14, 2013| first= Mike |last= Spofford| access-date= August 27, 2016}}</ref> The following week, he returned to the field with a less restrictive device that allowed his fingers to remain free. The device seemed to improve his performance the following week. After completing only two tackles (one solo) with no sacks, stuffs, hits, or hurries on the quarterback against the Philadelphia Eagles, in the Packers' Week 11 match-up against the [[2013 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] the following week, Matthews had four tackles, including a sack and stuff with the less restrictive device.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/12438/clay-matthews| title= Clay Matthews Game-by-Game Stats| publisher= ESPN| date= | access-date= August 27, 2016}}</ref> After the Giants game, Matthews went on to accumulate 4.5 more sacks and 17 tackles (10 solo) over the next five weeks. In Week 16, during the second to last game of the regular season against the [[2013 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], Matthews refractured his thumb and was out for the remainder of the season.\n\n====2014 season====\nPrior to the 2014 season, the Packers signed veteran free agent [[Julius Peppers]] to bring an additional pass rush to help Matthews. After a Week 8 loss to the [[2014 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], where the Packers defense gave up almost 500 yards of offense, including 172 yards rushing from Mark Ingram, Packers defensive coordinator Dom Capers and head coach Mike McCarthy decided to alter Matthews's position, alternating him between outside linebacker and middle linebacker during games, depending on the play call. The move paid huge dividends for both Matthews and the Packers defense, as the defense improved drastically over the final eight games of the season. After spending the first half of the season ranked near the bottom in the league in defense, the Packers finished the season ranked a respectable 14th in the NFL in total defense. Matthews's sack numbers also increased in the second half of the season. After only getting 2.5 sacks in the first eight games, Matthews had 8.5 sacks in the final eight games, including back-to-back two-sack games against the [[2014 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] and [[2014 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Matthews finished the season with 11 sacks, 9 passes defended, one interception (his first since 2011), and two forced fumbles. For the first time in his NFL career, Matthews started every game during the regular season.\n\n====2015 season====\n[[File:Clay Matthews entering the stadium Cropped.jpg|thumb|Matthews entering [[Lambeau Field]] before a game in October 2015]]\nMatthews helped lead his team to the NFC Divisional Round playoff game against the [[2015 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]], a game that it lost 26\u201320 in overtime.

It is bounded by [[Nuh district|NUH]] district of [[Haryana]] on the north, [[Mathura District|Mathura]] and [[Agra District|Agra]] districts of [[Uttar Pradesh]] on the east, and the district of [[Dholpur District|Dholpur]] on the south, [[Karauli]] on the southwest, [[Dausa District|Dausa]] on the west and [[Alwar District|Alwar]] district in the north-west.\n\nThree rivers, the [[Ban Ganga River|Ban Ganga]], Rooparel, and Gambhir, cross the district. The Ban Ganga originates in [[Jaipur District]], passes through [[Dausa district|Dausa]] and Bharatpur districts to meet the [[Yamuna River]] in Uttar Pradesh. The Gambhir River starts from Pachana Dam of Karauli District, and meets the Ban Ganga in [[Bayana Tehsil]]. The Rooparel River starts from hills of Alwar District and enters the district in [[Kaman Tehsil]].\n\n==Divisions==\nBharatpur District has ten revenue subdivisions and eleven tehsils. They have the same names and borders, except that Weir Subdivision is divided into [[Weir Tehsil]] and [[Bhusawar Tehsil]]. The other ten tehsils are: [[Bayana Tehsil|Bayana]], [[Bharatpur Tehsil|Bharatpur]], [[Deeg Tehsil|Deeg]], [[Kaman Tehsil|Kaman]], [[Kumher Tehsil|Kumher]], [[Nadbai Tehsil|Nadbai]], [[Nagar Tehsil|Nagar]], [[Pahari Tehsil|Pahari]], [[Uchchain Tehsil|Uchchain]]   and [[Roopwas Tehsil|Roopwas]] (Rupbas).<ref name=\"Bharatpur-AS\">{{Cite web|title=Administrative Setup|publisher=Bharatpur District|url=http://www.bharatpur.nic.in/admin.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511110703/http://bharatpur.nic.in/admin.htm|archivedate=2013-05-11}}</ref>\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Bharatpur District: Revenue Scheme<ref name=\"Bharatpur-AS\" />\n!

These numbers indicated a dramatic drop in support, as, two months prior, most polls showed about two-thirds of those polled supporting military action.

For example, an ABC news poll reported that only 10% of Americans favored giving the inspectors less than a few weeks; 41% favored giving them a few weeks, 33% a few months, and 13% more than that.<ref name=\"Polling Report\" />\n\nA consistent pattern in the months leading up to the U.S.-led invasion was that higher percentages of the population supported the impending war in polls that offered only two options (for or against) than in polls that broke down support into three or more options given (distinguishing unconditional support for the war, opposition to the war even if weapons inspectors do their job, and support if and only if inspection crews are allowed time to investigate first).\n\nSome polls also showed that the majority of Americans believed that President Bush had made his case against Iraq. The Gallup poll, for example, found that 67% of those who watched the speech felt that the case had been made, which was a jump from 47% just prior the speech. However, many more Republicans than Democrats watched the speech, so this may not be an accurate reflection of the overall opinion of the American public. An ABC news poll found little difference in the percentage of Americans who felt that [[George W.

On the other side of the aisle, Democrats have stayed fairly consistent in their views on the conflict, only shifting one percent in the past four years (28% to 27% positive view of the war).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal |Iraq|War }}\n*[[Support our troops]]\n*[[Iraq disarmament crisis]]\n*[[Opposition to the Iraq War]]\n*[[Protests against the Iraq War]]\n*[[Protests against the invasion of Afghanistan]]\n*[[2003 invasion of Iraq]]\n*[[Governments' positions pre-2003 invasion of Iraq]]\n*[[Public relations preparations for 2003 invasion of Iraq]]\n*[[United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War]]\n*[[Lafayette hillside memorial|Lafayette Hillside Memorial]]\n*[[International public opinion on the war in Afghanistan]]\n*[[List of Congressional opponents of the Iraq War]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Iraq War}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Popular Opinion In The Us On The Invasion Of Iraq}}\n[[Category:Stances and opinions regarding the Iraq War]]\n[[Category:Public opinion in the United States|Invasion of Iraq]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]|more information on this topic|Views on the 2003 invasion of Iraq}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2011}}\n{{Tone|date=December 2007}}\n{{condense|date=September 2011}}\n{{update|reason=The article needs data from 2008-2017|date=November 2017}}\n}}\n{{Use American English|date=November 2017}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2017}}\n{{Campaignbox Iraq War}}\n\n[[File:UStanks baghdad 2003.JPEG|250px|thumb|M1A1 Abrams pose for a photo under the \"Hands of Victory\" in Ceremony Square, [[Baghdad, Iraq]].]]\n\nThe [[United States]] public's opinion on the [[invasion of Iraq]] has changed significantly since the years preceding the incursion. For various reasons, mostly related to the unexpected consequences of the invasion, as well as misinformation provided by US authorities, the US public's perspective on its government's choice to initiate an offensive is increasingly negative.

According to the CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll, conducted on October 3\u20136, 2002, 53% of Americans say they favor invading Iraq with U.S. ground troops in an attempt to remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power (Saad, Lydia). As represented in the chart below the American public's support for the war fluctuated between 50% and 60% during the aftermath of attacks 9/11.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/6964/top-ten-findings-about-public-opinion-iraq.aspx|title=Top Ten Findings About Public Opinion and Iraq|first=Gallup|last=Inc.|website=Gallup.com|access-date=November 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030755/http://news.gallup.com/poll/6964/top-ten-findings-about-public-opinion-iraq.aspx|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked whether or not the United States should attack a country that has not attacked the United States first, the American public's opinion was in support with 51%, whereas when Iraq was embedded into the question the attitude shifted and there was a shift to 66% of Americans agreeing that U.S. should be able to invade Iraq first.\n\nDespite public concern for the consequences of war the public's support remained very high. Original concerns included, 55 percent of Americans fearing that the war would last too long, 44 percent taking in consideration a mass number of casualties, 62 percent of the public being convinced that this would increase short-term terrorism domestically, 76 felt there would be a higher risk of domestic [[bioterrorism]], and 35 believed that the draft would need to be reinstated. At the same time 40 percent of the American public was against having protests because they believed it would undermine the success abroad.  Additionally, 55 percent supported the war even without support from the UN.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sgadaria.expressions.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Iraq-article_Gershkoff_Kushner.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813061204/https://sgadaria.expressions.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Iraq-article_Gershkoff_Kushner.pdf |archive-date=August 13, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:No war pdx.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Protests in [[Portland, Oregon]] in March 2006]]\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:PresidentBushMeetsTroops.jpg|thumb|left|President Bush meets troops in flight gear]] -->\nApproximately two-thirds of respondents wanted the government to wait for the UN inspections to end, and only 31% supported using military force immediately. This same poll showed that a majority believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but did not expect UN inspectors to find them. These numbers indicated a dramatic drop in support, as, two months prior, most polls showed about two-thirds of those polled supporting military action. However, about 60% of those polled also supported, if necessary, the use of military action to remove Hussein from power which closely mirrored recent polls taken by [[Time Magazine]], [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], [[USA Today]], [[CBS News]], and other news organizations.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Polls also showed that most Americans did not think that Saddam was co-operating with inspectors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/23/opinion/polls/main537739.shtml|title=Poll: Talk First, Fight Later|access-date=February 16, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330062908/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/23/opinion/polls/main537739.shtml|archive-date=March 30, 2007|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nPolls also suggested that most Americans would still like to see more evidence against Iraq, and for UN weapons inspections to continue before making an invasion. For example, an ABC news poll reported that only 10% of Americans favored giving the inspectors less than a few weeks; 41% favored giving them a few weeks, 33% a few months, and 13% more than that.<ref name=\"Polling Report\" />\n\nA consistent pattern in the months leading up to the U.S.-led invasion was that higher percentages of the population supported the impending war in polls that offered only two options (for or against) than in polls that broke down support into three or more options given (distinguishing unconditional support for the war, opposition to the war even if weapons inspectors do their job, and support if and only if inspection crews are allowed time to investigate first).\n\nSome polls also showed that the majority of Americans believed that President Bush had made his case against Iraq. The Gallup poll, for example, found that 67% of those who watched the speech felt that the case had been made, which was a jump from 47% just prior the speech. However, many more Republicans than Democrats watched the speech, so this may not be an accurate reflection of the overall opinion of the American public. An ABC news poll found little difference in the percentage of Americans who felt that [[George W. Bush]] has made his case for war after he had made his speech, with the percentage remaining at about 40%.<ref name=\"Polling Report\" />\n\n[[File:Bush announces Operation Iraqi Freedom 2003.jpg|thumb|300px|left|President George W.

[[Tim Russert]], [[NBC]]'s Washington bureau chief, said the increases in support were \"largely\" due to President Bush's [[State of the Union]] speech in January and to Powell's presentation on February 5, which most viewers felt offered strong evidence for action against Iraq. Bush's approval ratings climbed seven points, and support for the invasion increased by four points. Only 27% opposed military action, the smallest percentage since the polls began in April 2002. The percentage of Americans supporting an invasion without UN support jumped eight points to 37%. 49% of those polled felt that President Bush had prepared the country for war and its potential risks, a 9-point jump from the previous month.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msnbc.com/news/869402.asp|title=MSNBC \u2014 Breaking News, Top Stories, & Show Clips|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> A [[Gallup poll]] showed the majority of the population erroneously believed Iraq was responsible for the attacks of September 11.\n\n===Invasion of Iraq===\nAlthough pro-war sentiments were very high after 9/11, public opinion stabilized soon after, and slightly in favor of the war.

Nearly six in 10 said they were ready for such an invasion \"in the next week or two.\"  But that support dropped off if the U.N. backing was not first obtained. If the [[United Nations Security Council]] were to reject a resolution paving the way for military action, 54% of Americans favored a U.S. invasion. And if the Bush administration did not seek a final Security Council vote, support for a war dropped to 47%.<ref name=\"usatoday2003\"/>\n\nAn ABC News/Washington Post poll taken after the beginning of the war showed a 62% support for the war, lower than the 79% in favor at the beginning of the [[Persian Gulf War]].<ref name=\"Polling Report\" />\n\nHowever, when the US invaded Iraq in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], public support for the conflict rose once again. According to a Gallup poll, support for the war was up to 72 percent on March 19, the day the fighting began. Positive opinion on the war was not only present, it was strong. Out of the 72 percent who reported supporting the war, 59 percent reported supporting the war strongly, and although allied commanders said they had not yet found evidence of weapons of mass destruction days after the initial invasion, 9 out of 10 Americans believed it was \"at least somewhat likely\" that the United States would find evidence of these weapons.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nPresident [[George W.

It was produced by Nippon Television Douga (previously known as Japan Broadcast Film, and Tokyo TV Movie). It aired from April 1, 1973 to September 30, 1973. After the anime ended, Doraemon remained exclusively a manga until 1979 when [[Shin-Ei Animation]] produced a more successful [[Doraemon (1979 anime)|second anime adaptation]], which officially ended in 2005; it was in turn replaced by a [[Doraemon (2005 anime)|third anime adaptation]] shortly after which continues to air to recent days.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Doraemon characters}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Doraemon characters (1973).png|thumb|right|Cast of the 1973 version]]\nThe voice cast was determined in cooperation with [[Aoni Production]] and Theatre Echo\n* Doraemon \u2013 [[K\u014dsei Tomita]] (from episode 1A to 13B) and [[Masako Nozawa]] (from Episode 14A to 26B)\n*Nobita Nobi \u2013 [[:ja:\u592a\u7530\u6dd1\u5b50|Yoshiko Ota]]\n*Shizuka Minamoto \u2013 [[:ja:\u6075\u6bd4\u5bff\u307e\u3055\u5b50|Ebisu Masako]]\n*Suneo \u2013 [[Shun Yashiro]]\n*Takeshi (Gian) Gouda \u2013 [[Kaneta Kimotsuki]]\n*Tamako Nobi \u2013 [[Noriko Ohara]]\n*Nobisuke Nobi - [[Ichir\u014d Murakoshi]]\n*Suneo's Mother - [[Kazue Takahashi]]\n*Suneo's Father - from [[Sanji Hase]] to [[:ja:\u52a0\u85e4\u6cbb|Osamu Kat\u014d]]\n*Gian's Father - unknown\n*Sewashi - [[Keiko Yamamoto]]\n*Ganari - from [[:ja:\u52a0\u85e4\u6cbb|Osamu Kat\u014d]] to [[Masashi Amenomori]]\n*Gachako - [[Junko Hori]]\n*Botako - [[Masako Nozawa]]\n*Damako - [[Noriko Tsukase]]\n*Jamako - [[Rihoko Yoshida]]\n\n==Production and Broadcast==\nThe series was broadcast between May 25 to September 30, 1973 on [[Nippon TV|Nippon Television]]. 26 episodes, divided into 52 individual segments were produced. A pilot film was produced in 1972 and shown to test audiences in January 1973. Audience included Doraemon creator [[Fujiko Fujio]]. They initially approved of the show, but when they were shown the progress, they apparently were angered by the fact that they changed Nobita and Doraemon's personalities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} The show was frequently rebroadcast throughout the 1970s. The station, [[Toyama Television]], was the last to air the show, airing from July 3 to July 24, 1981, and briefly again in August of that year. The station aired the show in individual segments. On August 3, the [[Shogakukan|publisher]] of the Doraemon manga requested the station to cease airing the show, to make sure the reputation of the more famous and longer running [[Doraemon (1979 anime)|1979 series]] isn't harmed. The animation crew of the show, [[Nippon TeleMovie Productions]], went bankrupt in 1981. Before they went defunct, they tried covering debt by selling off the masters of the 1973 series, and destroying [[cel]]s and [[storyboards]] in a kerosene fire. In 1995, the Japanese animation studio [[Imagica|IMAGICA]], discovered episodes 18 and 20 through 26 in their archive, as well as segments 5A, 10B and 12B.\n\nIn 2003, the production chief of the show, [[:ja:\u771f\u4f50\u7f8e\u30b8\u30e5\u30f3|Hiroshi Shimozaki]], now going under the name Masumi Jun or \"mcsammy\", came forward with several episodes and [[rush reels]] (raw footage). He later uploaded low quality versions of the intro and credits to his site on a members only and password protected page, however, a few minutes after the upload, he was told that the intro and credits were uploaded to Japanese anonymous board site [[2channel]]. He immediately removed the video files from his site, but it was already too late. Many images of his episodes were uploaded to GeoCities. In the late 1990s, a person came forward with a [[VHS]] recording of the episode \"Crazy Stomach Clock\", dated from 1978. Audio clips were uploaded, but the site they were hosted on was removed. In 2015, a YouTube user discovered a clip playing on a television set in a Japanese pornographic film from the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-strange-case-of-the-1973-doraemon-series |title=The Strange Case of the 1973 \u201cDoraemon\u201d Series |last=Brubaker |first=Charles |date=May 28, 2013 |publisher=Cartoon Research |access-date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\nIt is what seems like impossible to find info on this version of Doraemon.

series]] based on [[Fujiko Fujio]]'s [[Doraemon|manga of the same name]]. It was produced by Nippon Television Douga (previously known as Japan Broadcast Film, and Tokyo TV Movie). It aired from April 1, 1973 to September 30, 1973. After the anime ended, Doraemon remained exclusively a manga until 1979 when [[Shin-Ei Animation]] produced a more successful [[Doraemon (1979 anime)|second anime adaptation]], which officially ended in 2005; it was in turn replaced by a [[Doraemon (2005 anime)|third anime adaptation]] shortly after which continues to air to recent days.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Doraemon characters}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Doraemon characters (1973).png|thumb|right|Cast of the 1973 version]]\nThe voice cast was determined in cooperation with [[Aoni Production]] and Theatre Echo\n* Doraemon \u2013 [[K\u014dsei Tomita]] (from episode 1A to 13B) and [[Masako Nozawa]] (from Episode 14A to 26B)\n*Nobita Nobi \u2013 [[:ja:\u592a\u7530\u6dd1\u5b50|Yoshiko Ota]]\n*Shizuka Minamoto \u2013 [[:ja:\u6075\u6bd4\u5bff\u307e\u3055\u5b50|Ebisu Masako]]\n*Suneo \u2013 [[Shun Yashiro]]\n*Takeshi (Gian) Gouda \u2013 [[Kaneta Kimotsuki]]\n*Tamako Nobi \u2013 [[Noriko Ohara]]\n*Nobisuke Nobi - [[Ichir\u014d Murakoshi]]\n*Suneo's Mother - [[Kazue Takahashi]]\n*Suneo's Father - from [[Sanji Hase]] to [[:ja:\u52a0\u85e4\u6cbb|Osamu Kat\u014d]]\n*Gian's Father - unknown\n*Sewashi - [[Keiko Yamamoto]]\n*Ganari - from [[:ja:\u52a0\u85e4\u6cbb|Osamu Kat\u014d]] to [[Masashi Amenomori]]\n*Gachako - [[Junko Hori]]\n*Botako - [[Masako Nozawa]]\n*Damako - [[Noriko Tsukase]]\n*Jamako - [[Rihoko Yoshida]]\n\n==Production and Broadcast==\nThe series was broadcast between May 25 to September 30, 1973 on [[Nippon TV|Nippon Television]]. 26 episodes, divided into 52 individual segments were produced. A pilot film was produced in 1972 and shown to test audiences in January 1973. Audience included Doraemon creator [[Fujiko Fujio]]. They initially approved of the show, but when they were shown the progress, they apparently were angered by the fact that they changed Nobita and Doraemon's personalities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} The show was frequently rebroadcast throughout the 1970s. The station, [[Toyama Television]], was the last to air the show, airing from July 3 to July 24, 1981, and briefly again in August of that year. The station aired the show in individual segments. On August 3, the [[Shogakukan|publisher]] of the Doraemon manga requested the station to cease airing the show, to make sure the reputation of the more famous and longer running [[Doraemon (1979 anime)|1979 series]] isn't harmed. The animation crew of the show, [[Nippon TeleMovie Productions]], went bankrupt in 1981. Before they went defunct, they tried covering debt by selling off the masters of the 1973 series, and destroying [[cel]]s and [[storyboards]] in a kerosene fire. In 1995, the Japanese animation studio [[Imagica|IMAGICA]], discovered episodes 18 and 20 through 26 in their archive, as well as segments 5A, 10B and 12B.\n\nIn 2003, the production chief of the show, [[:ja:\u771f\u4f50\u7f8e\u30b8\u30e5\u30f3|Hiroshi Shimozaki]], now going under the name Masumi Jun or \"mcsammy\", came forward with several episodes and [[rush reels]] (raw footage). He later uploaded low quality versions of the intro and credits to his site on a members only and password protected page, however, a few minutes after the upload, he was told that the intro and credits were uploaded to Japanese anonymous board site [[2channel]]. He immediately removed the video files from his site, but it was already too late. Many images of his episodes were uploaded to GeoCities. In the late 1990s, a person came forward with a [[VHS]] recording of the episode \"Crazy Stomach Clock\", dated from 1978. Audio clips were uploaded, but the site they were hosted on was removed. In 2015, a YouTube user discovered a clip playing on a television set in a Japanese pornographic film from the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-strange-case-of-the-1973-doraemon-series |title=The Strange Case of the 1973 \u201cDoraemon\u201d Series |last=Brubaker |first=Charles |date=May 28, 2013 |publisher=Cartoon Research |access-date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\nIt is what seems like impossible to find info on this version of Doraemon. No episodes exist online, or on home media besides an audio recording of the final episode. The only footage currently available is Jun's uploads of the opening and ending.

Western European [[social critic]]s, including [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] were the first modern socialists who criticised the excessive poverty and inequality generated by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The term was first used in English in the British ''Cooperative Magazine'' in 1827 and came to be associated with the followers of the Owen such as the [[Rochdale Pioneers]], who founded the [[co-operative movement]]. Owen's followers stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels.

In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

Owen's followers stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies. In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|2ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite
