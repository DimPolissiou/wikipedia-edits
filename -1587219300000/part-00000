Historically, fine-haired Cashmere goats have been called ''Capra hircus laniger'', as if they were a subspecies of the domestic goat ''Capra hircus''. However, they are now more commonly considered part of the domestic goat subspecies ''Capra aegagrus hircus'' or the alternate version ''Hircus Blythi Goat''. Cashmere goats produce a double [[Wool|fleece]] that consists of a fine, soft undercoat or underdown of hair mingled with a straighter and much coarser outer coating of hair called [[guard hair]]. For the fine underdown to be sold and processed further, it must be de-haired. De-hairing is a mechanical process that separates the coarse hairs from the fine hair. After de-hairing, the resulting \"cashmere\" is ready to be dyed and converted into textile yarn, fabrics and garments.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Gathering ==\n[[File:cashmeregoat shearing.png|thumb|right|Cashmere shearing. [[Corindhap, Victoria|Corindhap]], Australia.]]\nCashmere wool is collected during the spring [[moulting]] season when the goats naturally shed their winter coat. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the goats moult as early as March and as late as May.\n\nIn some regions, the mixed mass of down and coarse hair is removed by hand with a coarse comb that pulls tufts of fiber from the animal as the comb is raked through the fleece. The collected fiber then has a higher yield of pure cashmere after the fiber has been washed and dehaired. The long, coarse guard hair is then typically clipped from the animal and is often used for brushes, [[interfacing]]s and other non-apparel uses. Animals in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australian Cashmere goat|Australia]] are typically [[shorn]] of their fleece, resulting in a higher coarse hair content and lower pure cashmere yield. In America, the most popular method is combing. The process takes up to two weeks, but with a trained eye for when the fiber is releasing, it is possible to comb the fibers out in about a week. The term \"baby cashmere\" is used for fibres harvested from younger goats, and has a reputation of being softer.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Shawl makers in Kashmir (1867).jpg|thumb|right|An 1867 [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]] painting depicting men manufacturing [[shawl]]s using pashm wool]]\n\n[[China]] has become the largest producer of raw cashmere, estimated at 19,200 metric tons (in hair) per year(2016).

Pure cashmere, resulting from removing animal grease, dirt and coarse hairs from the fleece, is estimated at about 6,500 tons (5,895 tonnes). Ultra-fine Cashmere or [[Pashmina]] is still produced by communities in [[Kashmir]] but its rarity and high price, along with political instability in the region, make it very hard to source and to regulate quality.

By 1811, with government assistance, Ternaux also began experimenting with the production of real India shawls using what he called  ''laine de Perse'', i.e., the down (''duvet'') of Tibetan-cashmere goats.<ref>Ternaux, William (1819). \"Notice sur l'importation en France des ch\u00e8vres \u00e0 laine de cachemire, originaires du Thibet\", ''Bulletin de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'industrie,'' XVIII.</ref> In 1818, Ternaux resolved to help establish herds of cashmere goats in France. A famous expedition to Persia was organized, led by the orientalist and diplomat [[Pierre Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Jaubert]], to be financed in part by the French government. Of the acquired herd of 1,500 animals, only 256 arrived safely in the spring of 1819 at Marseilles and Toulon via the Crimea. About 100 of the cashmere goats were then purchased by the French government (at 2,000 francs each) and sent to the royal sheep farm at Perpignan. The remainder, about 180 including new-borns, went to Ternaux's property at [[Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine|Saint-Ouen]] outside Paris.<ref>Ternaux, William (1822).

Paris.</ref> Although Ternaux had little success getting small farmers to add cashmeres to their sheep herds, a few wealthy landowners were willing to experiment with the goats. For example, Ternaux's herd was seen in 1823 by C.T.Tower of Weald Hall, Essex, England. Tower purchased two female and two male goats and took them back to England, wherein 1828 he was awarded a gold medal by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce for rearing a herd of cashmeres. Also, a few of Ternaux's goats were purchased for a model farm at Grignon, near [[Versailles]], run by M. Polonceau. Polonceau crossbred the cashmeres with Angora goats to improve the down for spinning and weaving. This Cashmere-Angora herd was seen by William Riley of New South Wales in 1828, and again in 1831 when Riley purchased thirteen of the goats for trans-shipment to Australia. At the time, the average production of the Polonceau herd was 16 ounces (500&nbsp;grams) of down. Ternaux's herd at St. Ouen still numbered 150 when the famous industrialist died in 1833. The herd at Perpignan died out by 1829.<ref>Southey, Thomas (1851). ''The Rise, Progress and Present State of Colonial Sheep & Wools''.

The Scottish Board of Trustees for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures offered a 300 [[pound sterling]] reward to the first person who could spin cashmere in Scotland based on the French system. Captain Charles Stuart Cochrane collected the required information while in Paris and received a Scottish patent for the process in 1831. In the autumn of 1831, he sold the patent to Henry Houldsworth and sons of Glasgow.

The shawl's arrival is said to have created an immediate sensation and plans were put in place to start manufacturing the product in France.<ref>\"Cashmere\", ''The New American Cyclopedia'', IV (1861), p.514.</ref>\n\nIn 1799 at his factory in Reims, [[William-Louis Ternaux]], the leading woolens manufacturer in France under Napoleon, began to produce imitation India shawls (''cachemires'') using the wool of Spanish merino sheep. By 1811, with government assistance, Ternaux also began experimenting with the production of real India shawls using what he called  ''laine de Perse'', i.e., the down (''duvet'') of Tibetan-cashmere goats.<ref>Ternaux, William (1819). \"Notice sur l'importation en France des ch\u00e8vres \u00e0 laine de cachemire, originaires du Thibet\", ''Bulletin de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'industrie,'' XVIII.</ref> In 1818, Ternaux resolved to help establish herds of cashmere goats in France. A famous expedition to Persia was organized, led by the orientalist and diplomat [[Pierre Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Jaubert]], to be financed in part by the French government. Of the acquired herd of 1,500 animals, only 256 arrived safely in the spring of 1819 at Marseilles and Toulon via the Crimea. About 100 of the cashmere goats were then purchased by the French government (at 2,000 francs each) and sent to the royal sheep farm at Perpignan. The remainder, about 180 including new-borns, went to Ternaux's property at [[Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine|Saint-Ouen]] outside Paris.<ref>Ternaux, William (1822). ''Recueil des pi\u00e8ces sur l'importation et naturalisation en France par MM. Ternaux et Jaubert des ch\u00e8vres de race thibetaine, ou ch\u00e8vres \u00e0 duvet de Cachemire''. Paris.</ref> Although Ternaux had little success getting small farmers to add cashmeres to their sheep herds, a few wealthy landowners were willing to experiment with the goats. For example, Ternaux's herd was seen in 1823 by C.T.Tower of Weald Hall, Essex, England. Tower purchased two female and two male goats and took them back to England, wherein 1828 he was awarded a gold medal by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce for rearing a herd of cashmeres. Also, a few of Ternaux's goats were purchased for a model farm at Grignon, near [[Versailles]], run by M. Polonceau. Polonceau crossbred the cashmeres with Angora goats to improve the down for spinning and weaving. This Cashmere-Angora herd was seen by William Riley of New South Wales in 1828, and again in 1831 when Riley purchased thirteen of the goats for trans-shipment to Australia. At the time, the average production of the Polonceau herd was 16 ounces (500&nbsp;grams) of down. Ternaux's herd at St. Ouen still numbered 150 when the famous industrialist died in 1833. The herd at Perpignan died out by 1829.<ref>Southey, Thomas (1851). ''The Rise, Progress and Present State of Colonial Sheep & Wools''.

The Scottish Board of Trustees for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures offered a 300 [[pound sterling]] reward to the first person who could spin cashmere in Scotland based on the French system. Captain Charles Stuart Cochrane collected the required information while in Paris and received a Scottish patent for the process in 1831. In the autumn of 1831, he sold the patent to Henry Houldsworth and sons of Glasgow. In 1832 Henry Houldsworth and sons commenced the manufacture of yarn, and in 1833 received the reward.<ref name=\"Scotland\">{{cite book| author=The Ministers of the respective parishes|title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland, Volume VI| publisher=William Blackwood & sons |location=Edinburgh and London| year=1854| page=168|url= https://books.google.com/?id=RaICAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=Cochrane+cashmere}}</ref>\n\nDawson International claim to have invented the first commercial dehairing machine in 1890, and from 1906 they purchased cashmere from China, but were restricted to purchasing fiber from Beijing and Tianjin until 1978. In 1978 trade was liberalised and Dawson International began buying cashmere from many provinces.<ref name=\"Mcgregor\" />\n\nMany early textile centers developed as part of the American Industrial Revolution. Among them, the [[Blackstone Valley]] became a major contributor to the American Industrial Revolution. The town of [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]], became an early textile center in the Blackstone Valley, which was known for the manufacture of cashmere wool and satinets.\n\nAustrian Textile Manufacturer [[Bernhard Altmann]] is credited with bringing cashmere to the United States of America on a mass scale beginning in 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://vintagefashionguild.org/label-resource/bernhard-altmann/|title=Vintage Fashion Guild : Label Resource : Altmann, Bernhard |work=vintagefashionguild.org}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe demand for the fiber has caused some vendors, both knowingly and not, to sell yarns or textiles containing little to no cashmere<ref name=\"Lanham\" /> representing themselves as being composed of cashmere. Wool and other fibers have been mixed in by unscrupulous manufacturers, deliberately selling mislabeled items to well-known department stores.

It includes as its northernmost point the town of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] and stretches south to include the towns of [[Alnwick]] and [[Amble]] \u2014 the Northumberland coast forms its long eastern boundary.  Its length is roughly 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) and its area is 2,310 square kilometres.\n\nPredominantly rural in character, this constituency is the most northerly in [[England]] and is relatively sparsely populated.\n\nBetween 1918 and 1949 the constituency comprised Berwick upon Tweed Municipal Borough, the Urban Districts of Alnwick, Amble and Rothbury, together with the Rural Districts of Alnwick, Belford, Glendale, Norham & Islandshire and Rothbury.\n\n===Boundary review===\nFollowing the last review of parliamentary representation in Northumberland, the [[Boundary Commission for England]] made only minor changes to the existing Berwick constituency.

It was represented by Liberal Democrat Sir [[Alan Beith]] from 1973 (formerly [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]) until his retirement in [[2015 UK general election|2015]], when it was gained by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate Anne-Marie Trevelyan. The area has been notable for its Liberal politicians \u2013 both [[William Beveridge|Sir William Beveridge]] (influential in the formation of the [[National Health Service]]) and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] (Foreign Secretary at the beginning of [[World War I]], best remembered for the \"lamps are going out all over Europe....\" remark) have served this constituency.\n\nBeith was first elected at a by-election, required as a result of the resignation of the then incumbent MP [[Antony Lambton]] (Conservative), who had been caught up in a scandal involving [[call girl]]s, [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper.\n\nIn 1923, [[Mabel Philipson]], a former [[music hall]] actress, took over the seat as a Conservative, when her husband was forced to resign. In doing so she became only the third female MP to sit in the House of Commons since female members became legal five years previously.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\nThe seat has sent members to Parliament since its enfranchisement by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].

Tweed.png|thumb|250px|Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland 1885-1918]] -->\nThe constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed is in the county of [[Northumberland]].  It includes as its northernmost point the town of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] and stretches south to include the towns of [[Alnwick]] and [[Amble]] \u2014 the Northumberland coast forms its long eastern boundary.  Its length is roughly 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) and its area is 2,310 square kilometres.\n\nPredominantly rural in character, this constituency is the most northerly in [[England]] and is relatively sparsely populated.\n\nBetween 1918 and 1949 the constituency comprised Berwick upon Tweed Municipal Borough, the Urban Districts of Alnwick, Amble and Rothbury, together with the Rural Districts of Alnwick, Belford, Glendale, Norham & Islandshire and Rothbury.\n\n===Boundary review===\nFollowing the last review of parliamentary representation in Northumberland, the [[Boundary Commission for England]] made only minor changes to the existing Berwick constituency. A proposal to rename the historic seat \"Berwick-upon-Tweed and Mid Northumberland\" was rejected: whilst it is geographically accurate, it was thought unwieldy{{#tag:ref|MPs references to each other at least in writing, are entered by a full constituency name in [[Hansard]]|group= n}}.\n\nThe electoral wards used to form the slightly modified constituency are:\n* The entire former district of [[Alnwick]]\n* The entire former district of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]]\n* The former [[Castle Morpeth]] wards of Chevington, Ellington, Hartburn, Longhorsley, Lynemouth, [[Ulgham]]\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Berwick (Parliament of Scotland constituency)}}\nRural in nature, sparse of population and with [[agriculture]] as a major source of employment, Berwick-upon-Tweed has never elected a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate, one of two constituencies in the north east of England not to have done so.The closest Labour have ever came to winning the seat was at the [[1966 UK general election|1966 general election]], where they finished just 4,373 votes behind incumbent Conservative MP Antony Lambton. It was represented by Liberal Democrat Sir [[Alan Beith]] from 1973 (formerly [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]) until his retirement in [[2015 UK general election|2015]], when it was gained by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate Anne-Marie Trevelyan. The area has been notable for its Liberal politicians \u2013 both [[William Beveridge|Sir William Beveridge]] (influential in the formation of the [[National Health Service]]) and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] (Foreign Secretary at the beginning of [[World War I]], best remembered for the \"lamps are going out all over Europe....\" remark) have served this constituency.\n\nBeith was first elected at a by-election, required as a result of the resignation of the then incumbent MP [[Antony Lambton]] (Conservative), who had been caught up in a scandal involving [[call girl]]s, [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper.\n\nIn 1923, [[Mabel Philipson]], a former [[music hall]] actress, took over the seat as a Conservative, when her husband was forced to resign. In doing so she became only the third female MP to sit in the House of Commons since female members became legal five years previously.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\nThe seat has sent members to Parliament since its enfranchisement by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. It initially sent two members; this was reduced to one in 1885.\n\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\n===MPs before 1660===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!First member!!Second

The most direct influence was, however, on graffiti painted in [[London Underground]] trains. Teenagers from inner London and other European cities who were into electro-hip hop and had family and other links to New York City had by the mid-1980s taken up some of the traditions of subway graffiti and exported them home, although legendary New York writers like Brim, Bio, and Futura had themselves played a significant role in establishing such links when they visited London in the early-to-mid-'80s and 'put up pieces' on or near the west London end of the Metropolitan Line. Almost as significantly, just when subway graffiti was on the decline in New York City, some British teenagers who had spent time with family in Queens and the Bronx returned to London with a \"mission\" to Americanize the London Underground through painting New York City-style graffiti on trains. These small groups of London 'train writers' adopted many of the styles and lifestyles of their New York City forebears, painting graffiti train pieces and in general 'bombing' the system, but favoring only a few selected underground lines seen as most suitable for train graffiti. Although on a substantially smaller scale than what had existed in New York City, graffiti on London Underground trains became seen as enough of a problem by the mid-1980s to provoke the British Transport Police to establish its own graffiti squad modeled directly on and in consultation with that of the New York City MTA. At the same time, graffiti art on London Underground trains generated some interest in the media and arts, leading to several art galleries putting on exhibitions of some of the art work (on canvass) of a few London train writers as well as TV documentaries on London hip hop culture like the BBC's ''Bad Meaning Good'', which included a section featuring interviews with London train writers and a few examples of their pieces.\n\nWhile many early rappers from the UK, such as [[Derek B]], imitated the styles and accents of their US heroes, there were many who realised that to merely transpose US forms would rob UK hip-hop of the ability to speak for a disenfranchised British constituency in the way that US hip-hop so successfully spoke to, and for, its audience. Attempts were made by UK rappers to develop styles more obviously rooted in British linguistic practices \u2014 [[Rodney P]] of the [[London Posse]] deliberately chose a London accent \u2014 although many succeeded only in adopting a slurred hybrid that located the rap \"somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean\".<ref>Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86\u2013110.

[[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] and [[Outlaw Posse]] developed a jazz influenced style, whilst MC Mell'O' mixed [[jazz]] and hardcore.

However, despite the chart success of some British-born hip hop artists \u2014 for example [[Monie Love]], [[Slick Rick]], [[Young MC]] and [[MF Doom]], who all moved to the US \u2014 the majority of the scene was still underground and small scale.\n\nKinetic Effect joined the scene in the early 1980s and was part of rap outfit 2 the Top as D-Koy; later, in 1991, he teamed with Insane Macbeth to record \"Borderin' Insanity\" (released in 1993) and in 1995, he recorded \"Man Bites Dog\"/\"The Effect of Fear\"<ref name=\"Heroes of UK Hip Hop\">[http://www.heroesofukhiphop.com/Kinetic.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204163244/http://www.heroesofukhiphop.com/Kinetic.htm|date=4 February 2012}}</ref> Their song \"The Rhythm I Give 'Em\" made the UK Top 10 Hip Hop chart.

More was to come in the early 1990s in the form of [[MC Reason]] (a.k.a Voice of Reason) with \"Symbolise\"/\"HouseQuake\" and [[Jonie D]] with \"Which Base\"/\"Ride On\" which was performed live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1991.\n\nA mindset began to develop \u2014 typified by the [[Gunshot (band)|Gunshot]] tune \"No Sell Out\" (1991), or [[Hardnoise|Son of Noise]]'s \"Poor But Hardcore\" (1992) \u2014 that distrusted successful artists who did not utilise the hardcore style most associated with the scene. [[Silver Bullet (rapper)|Silver Bullet]]'s chart success was applauded due to an uncompromisingly rapid delivery, whereas Derek B and [[Rebel MC]] were scorned when their more pop influenced styles earned them success. Such artists were often branded \"sell outs\". As the scene grew, it became less common for British rappers to imitate US accents (those who did were often ridiculed) and British rap became more assured of its identity.\n\n''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'' \u2014 the first major British hip hop magazine \u2014 was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London such as Blade, [[Black Radical Mk II]], [[Overlord X]] and Bushkiller (including Sirus) \u2014 but many distinct scenes developed nationally.\n\nBirmingham and the West Midlands gave rise to [[Credit to the Nation]], whose MC Fusion would espouse conscious anti-racist, sexist and homophobic lyrics. The band would also find some brief mainstream success with their [[indie rock]] crossover sound. Leeds spawned [[Braintax]] and Breaking the Illusion (who together founded [[Low Life Records]]) as well as [[Nightmares on Wax]]. Greater Manchester gave birth to the [[Ruthless Rap Assassins]], Krispy 3 (later Krispy), the [[Kaliphz]], [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[MC Tunes]].\n\nBristol's scene has a long history going right back to the early '80s where links were made with outfits from New York. [[The Fearless Four (group)|The Fearless Four]] came over in 1984 along with graffiti legends the [[Tats Cru]] and [[Rock Steady Crew]].  Bristol (specifically the [[St Pauls, Bristol|St. Pauls]] area) produced The Wild Bunch (later better known as [[Massive Attack]]), [[Nellee Hooper]] who went on to produce for [[Soul II Soul]]. The city has also produced notable DMC DJs Mad Cut and DJ Quest. The city later became the home of [[trip hop]] with artists like [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].\n\n[[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] signed to a major label \u2014 [[Profile Records]], the label home of [[Run\u2013D.M.C.]] \u2014 and Kold Sweat came into their own, discovering groups like SL Troopers, [[Dynametrix]], Unanimous Decision and Katch 22, whose \"Diary of a Blackman\" was banned by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] for using a sound clip from the [[British National Front|National Front]].\n\nIn 1991, [[Hijack (hip hop group)|Hijack]] released ''The Horns of Jericho'' (Rhyme Syndicate Records, 1991) on [[Ice-T]]'s recently formed Rhyme Syndicate label. The first single, \"The Badman Is Robbin'\", was a top 40 hit and they went on sell more than 30,000 albums.\n\nBritish hip hop was affected by the record industry clamping down on [[sampling (music)|sampling]], beginning to charge for the use of samples and prosecuting those who used them without permission. Larger US acts could afford to license samples and still turn a profit for their labels, a luxury not available to many smaller UK artists. One such victim of this was [[Milton Keynes]] group [[the Criminal Minds]]. Their first two releases, the 1990 mini-album ''Guilty as Charged'' and a 1991 EP ''Tales from the Wasteland'' were bogged down by potential sample clearance problems and thus were only ever made available in small numbers, yet rate amongst some of the finest pieces of UK hip hop recorded. As [[breakbeat hardcore]] music started to become very popular in the UK in the early 1990s, the Criminal Minds turned their attention to making this type of music instead.\n\nThe UK hip hop boom never achieved its predicted commercial success. Hijack's ''The Horns of Jericho'' was never released in the US, while record companies dropped artists, citing poor sales and lack of interest. [[Mango Records]] closed down, and the British public began to turn their affections to [[Jungle music|jungle]], a fusion of breakbeat hardcore, hip hop and reggae. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them \u2014 for example [[Massive Attack]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |title=BBC News website, Massive Attack on the net |date=29 March 1998 |accessdate=2 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509115510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |archive-date=9 May 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> with [[trip hop]], or [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]], [[Us3]] and [[Urban Species]] with [[acid jazz]].\n\nIn the period between 1992 and 1995, the only groups to make much impact were Gunshot amd [[The Brotherhood (rap group)|the Brotherhood]]. \nGunshot's 1992 album ''Patriot Games'' was a landmark with tracks such as \"Mind of a Razor\" and \"World War 3\" becoming British hardcore classics.  Formed in the '80s, the Brotherhood released their first record, simply called ''Brotherhood EP'', as a white label in 1991. They went on to release ''Wayz of the Wize'' in 1992, then ''Untitled 93'' and ''XXIII'' in 1993, and ''Hip Hop N' Rap'' in 1994, all on the Bite It! label. None of the records sold in huge numbers but they managed to gain airplay on the [[Tim Westwood]] show and DJ 279's show on [[Choice FM]], gaining them a solid following across the UK. Bite It! also released tracks from artists such as Pauly Ryan and the Scientists of Sound.\n\n===New generation: Late '90s\u2013early '00s===\nFollowing an initial flurry of interest from major record labels in the 1980s, by the early 1990s the scene had moved underground after record companies pulled back. In the mid-1990s hip hop in the UK started to experiment and diversify \u2014 often mutating into different genres entirely, such as [[trip hop]] and began making inroads into the US market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |title=Q101 Top 101 of 1997 |publisher=Rocklists.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091722/http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs the old rappers left the scene, a new generation, raised on hip hop and [[electronica]], was coming of age: [[The Herbaliser]] released ''Remedies'' ([[Ninja Tune]], 1995), [[Mr. Scruff]] released the \"Frolic EP Pt 1\" (Pleasure Music, 1995), [[Mark B]] released \"Any More Questions?\" (Jazz Fudge, 1995) and [[DJ Skitz]] released \"Where My Mind Is At/Blessed Be The Manor\" (Ronin Records, 1996) featuring a young rapper called [[Roots Manuva]] on guest vocals who had previously released the single \"Next Type of Motion\" (Sound of Money, 1995).\n\nRecord labels that attempted to merge British hip hop style and sensibilities with modern dance music began to emerge, like [[Rae & Christian|Mark Rae]]'s [[Grand Central Records|Grand Central]] (home to Aim, Rae & Christian, and Fingathing, among others) or [[DJ Vadim]]'s Jazz Fudge. Increasingly, these artists managed to avoid the issues surrounding sampling by making music themselves (bands such as the [[Stereo MCs]] began playing instruments and sampling their own tunes) or searching out more obscure records where a most cost effective licensing deal could be arranged.\n\nBritish hip hop began to go through a renaissance,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/reviews/1482738.stm |title=BBC News website: British hip hop renaissance |first=Barney |last=Rowntree |date=10 August 2001 |accessdate=2 November 2006}}</ref> its style shifting from the hardcore template of its youth and moving into more melodic territory.\n\nThe Brotherhood managed to broker a major deal with Virgin Records in 1995.  Continuing their relationship with Trevor Jackson as their producer, they released 3 singles \u2018Alphabetical Response\u2019, \u2018One Shot\u2019, \u2018Punk Funk\u2019 and their album ''[[Elementalz]]'', all in 1996.  Their work was met with critical acclaim and they toured solidly with American artists including Cypress Hill, The Roots and WuTang, but big record sales seemed to be very elusive and they parted ways with Virgin in 1998.\n[[File:MF Doom The Arches 2.jpg|thumb|255x255px|MF Doom has been ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rappers-music-greatest-celebrities-tupac|title=11 Rappers Who Should Be Added To Everyones Playlists|date=2018-11-05|website=The Odyssey Online|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>]]\nIn late 1996 [[Will Ashon]] started up his new [[Ninja Tune]] backed label [[Big Dada]] and planned a roster of performers. Bandit of Birmingham's MSI/Asylum crew informed Will of [[Juice Aleem]] that he was contemplating who could truly represent the ethos of the new label. Ashon was impressed with the demo and agreed to have Aleem on board. The results of this were the first release of the now famous record label: in 1997 Juice featured on Big Dada record label's first ever release[2], \"Misanthropic\", under the pseudonym \"Alpha Prhyme\", a collaboration between himself and [[Luke Vibert]].\n\nIn 1998 [[Mark B]] and Blade released \"Hitmen for Hire EP\", which featured guest appearances from [[Lewis Parker (musician)|Lewis Parker]] and [[Mr Thing]] (of the [[Scratch Perverts]]). The EP was a success, and led to the successful 2001 album ''The Unknown'', which despite never charting in the UK top 75, was still a top 100 success and an even bigger success within its genre. Also, the album spawned the 2001 top 40 single \"Ya Don't See the Signs\", which was a remix by [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] frontman [[Grant Nicholas]], after the title track was a top 75 hit and Blade with Mark B supported Feeder. The same year, Bristol's Hombr\u00e9 label released the \"2012 EP\" from [[Aspects (band)|Aspects]], a benchmark release within the movement. [[Roots Manuva]], [[Blak Twang]], [[Mud Family]], [[Ti2bs]], [[Task Force (band)|Task Force]], [[Phi Life Cypher]], MSI & Asylum, [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[Ty (rapper)|Ty]] all came to the public's attention, while veteran acts [[Rodney P]], [[Demon Boyz|Mike J]], and MC Mell'O' returned to the scene. In 1999, MF Doom released his debut studio album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'' which has since been ranked as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.\n\n===Underground to mainstream: '00s to 2010s===\nA new generation of artists emerged following the turn of the century, including [[Jehst]], [[Skinnyman]], [[Nicky Spesh]], [[Foreign Beggars]] and Usmaan. At the same time, a new style of [[electronic music]] emerged in the early 2000s, derivative of [[UK Garage]] and [[jungle]], with influences from [[Dancehall]], [[Drum and bass]] and [[hip hop]]. The new genre was dubbed [[Grime (music)|grime]] (sometimes called eskibeat or sublow) and effectively superseded UK hip hop in both popularity and the mainstream conscious. Notable grime acts include [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], [[Lethal Bizzle]], [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Skepta]], [[Jme (musician)|Jme]], [[Jammer (rapper)|Jammer]], [[Shystie]], [[Ghetts]] and [[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]]. Grime music saw some early success in America with Wiley, Kano and Dizzee Rascal, all releasing music across the atlantic. Grime is generally considered to be distinct from hip-hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|title=Deeper Than Rap: Grime is Not a Subgenre of Hip-Hop|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914112019/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|archive-date=14 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|title=Skepta, grime and urban British youth language: a guide|last=|first=|date=|website=The Conversation|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008174156/http://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|archive-date=8 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|title=Grime is Approaching the Breakthrough Moment Hip-Hop Reached in the 90s|last=|first=|date=2016-12-21|website=Vice|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105013003/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|archive-date=5 November 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":05\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|title=Grime time: What it is and where to find it|last=|first=|date=2016-05-13|website=Standard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025044957/https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|archive-date=25 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"complex2\">{{Cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2016/06/hip-hop-dancehall-breaking-down-the-origins-of-grime/dizzee-talks-hip-hop-rosenberg|title=Hip-Hop Or Dancehall?

Amongst this new generation included artists such as [[Klashnekoff]], [[Akala (rapper)|Akala]], [[Lowkey]] and the Poisonous Poets. \n\nThe mid-2000s saw the emergence of Road rap, a genre that took influences from American gangsta rap and focused on crime, gang, or violent themes.

Loud, [[M Huncho]], Nafe Smallz, K-Trap, and [[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz) plus many more. Many of these artists gained influences from the American trap scene and deciding to add the UK sound and flavour to the genre. Many of them talk about braggadocious lifestyles they live and how it affects their music. In several interviews before, [[M Huncho]] has described his more tone-down, melodic style and moderately humbler approach when it comes to lyrics as his own derivative take on UK [[trap music]], in a genre he has personally dubbed as \"trapwave\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|work=A Nation Of Billions|title=Welcome To The TrapWave: M Huncho|date=29 May 2018|access-date=4 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604120145/https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|archive-date=4 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Wolverhampton artist [[Scarlxrd]] implements an energetic aesthetic and tone with explosively brazen screaming vocals, and dark yet reflectively intense and meaningful lyricism in an essentially self-pioneered style known as \"[[Rap metal#Trap metal|trap-metal]]\" or \"ragecore\"; a fusion of trap music and screaming vocals. Scarlxrd has cited some of his main inspirations and influences as including the likes of [[Eminem]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Travi$ Scott]] and [[Linkin Park]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|work=Kerrang|title=SCARLXRD: \"BRING ME THE HORIZON\u2019S LEGACY INSPIRES ME\"|date=27 February 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806082026/https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|archive-date=6 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|work=XXL|title=Scarlxrd Ditches YouTuber Lifestyle and His Black Mask for Screamo Success|date=25 May 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519003815/https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|archive-date=19 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSgIYzwOYw|work=PopkillerTV|title=SCARLXRD \u2013 interview: \"My style is a mix of Eminem, Travis Scott and Slipknot\" (05.2018) \u2013 YouTube|date=12 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNotable British trap artists and groups include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*6IXVI (6 Figure Music)\n*Ay Em\n*Baseman\n*Clue\n*[[D-Block Europe]]\n*Dappy\n*Fekky\n*[[Fredo (rapper)|Fredo]]\n*House of Pharaohs\n*K-Trap\n*Lancey Foux\n*[[M Huncho]]\n*Nafe Smallz\n*[[Octavian (rapper)|Octavian]]\n*S-X\n*S Loud\n*[[Scarlxrd]]\n*Sigeol\n*Skeamer\n*[[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz)\n*[[Smoke Boys]] (formerly Section Boyz)\n*Solo LDN\n*Suspect\n*TE dness\n*Young Tribez (formerly Bank Roll Young)\n*Yung Fume\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Backlash against commercialisation==\nSince grime's post-millennial boom period coincided with UK hip-hop's, the eagerly anticipated commercial breakout of the latter did not happen. Instead, acts such as [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[N-Dubz]] and [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]] were signed to major labels and their traditional sound tweaked to fit a pop sensibility. However the lineage of these, and many UK rappers, is unquestionably grime rather than UK hip-hop.\n\nThere is a common belief within the underground hip hop community that true hip hop is music relevant primarily to the disenfranchised listeners, rather than the mass market. Because of the belief that mainstream acts are paid large sums of money by the major labels to make music tailored to the current mass market, these artists often face a backlash and accusations of 'selling out' from the underground community.<ref>{{cite news|title=British hip-hop heads out of the underground|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|accessdate=10 October 2016|work=The Independent|date=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010215230/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|archive-date=10 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nThe growth of British hip hop was given a boost when in 2002, the BBC launched a digital radio station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]] devoted to \"new black music\" including hip hop, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[UK garage]], [[dancehall]], [[Grime music|grime]] and drum and bass,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |title=BBC Website: 1xtra |accessdate=1 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104060217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |archive-date=4 November 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> however 1Xtra does not play exclusively British hip hop.

The most direct influence was, however, on graffiti painted in [[London Underground]] trains. Teenagers from inner London and other European cities who were into electro-hip hop and had family and other links to New York City had by the mid-1980s taken up some of the traditions of subway graffiti and exported them home, although legendary New York writers like Brim, Bio, and Futura had themselves played a significant role in establishing such links when they visited London in the early-to-mid-'80s and 'put up pieces' on or near the west London end of the Metropolitan Line. Almost as significantly, just when subway graffiti was on the decline in New York City, some British teenagers who had spent time with family in Queens and the Bronx returned to London with a \"mission\" to Americanize the London Underground through painting New York City-style graffiti on trains. These small groups of London 'train writers' adopted many of the styles and lifestyles of their New York City forebears, painting graffiti train pieces and in general 'bombing' the system, but favoring only a few selected underground lines seen as most suitable for train graffiti. Although on a substantially smaller scale than what had existed in New York City, graffiti on London Underground trains became seen as enough of a problem by the mid-1980s to provoke the British Transport Police to establish its own graffiti squad modeled directly on and in consultation with that of the New York City MTA. At the same time, graffiti art on London Underground trains generated some interest in the media and arts, leading to several art galleries putting on exhibitions of some of the art work (on canvass) of a few London train writers as well as TV documentaries on London hip hop culture like the BBC's ''Bad Meaning Good'', which included a section featuring interviews with London train writers and a few examples of their pieces.\n\nWhile many early rappers from the UK, such as [[Derek B]], imitated the styles and accents of their US heroes, there were many who realised that to merely transpose US forms would rob UK hip-hop of the ability to speak for a disenfranchised British constituency in the way that US hip-hop so successfully spoke to, and for, its audience. Attempts were made by UK rappers to develop styles more obviously rooted in British linguistic practices \u2014 [[Rodney P]] of the [[London Posse]] deliberately chose a London accent \u2014 although many succeeded only in adopting a slurred hybrid that located the rap \"somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean\".<ref>Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86\u2013110.

However, despite the chart success of some British-born hip hop artists \u2014 for example [[Monie Love]], [[Slick Rick]], [[Young MC]] and [[MF Doom]], who all moved to the US \u2014 the majority of the scene was still underground and small scale.\n\nKinetic Effect joined the scene in the early 1980s and was part of rap outfit 2 the Top as D-Koy; later, in 1991, he teamed with Insane Macbeth to record \"Borderin' Insanity\" (released in 1993) and in 1995, he recorded \"Man Bites Dog\"/\"The Effect of Fear\"<ref name=\"Heroes of UK Hip Hop\">[http://www.heroesofukhiphop.com/Kinetic.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204163244/http://www.heroesofukhiphop.com/Kinetic.htm|date=4 February 2012}}</ref> Their song \"The Rhythm I Give 'Em\" made the UK Top 10 Hip Hop chart.

More was to come in the early 1990s in the form of [[MC Reason]] (a.k.a Voice of Reason) with \"Symbolise\"/\"HouseQuake\" and [[Jonie D]] with \"Which Base\"/\"Ride On\" which was performed live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1991.\n\nA mindset began to develop \u2014 typified by the [[Gunshot (band)|Gunshot]] tune \"No Sell Out\" (1991), or [[Hardnoise|Son of Noise]]'s \"Poor But Hardcore\" (1992) \u2014 that distrusted successful artists who did not utilise the hardcore style most associated with the scene. [[Silver Bullet (rapper)|Silver Bullet]]'s chart success was applauded due to an uncompromisingly rapid delivery, whereas Derek B and [[Rebel MC]] were scorned when their more pop influenced styles earned them success. Such artists were often branded \"sell outs\". As the scene grew, it became less common for British rappers to imitate US accents (those who did were often ridiculed) and British rap became more assured of its identity.\n\n''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'' \u2014 the first major British hip hop magazine \u2014 was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London such as Blade, [[Black Radical Mk II]], [[Overlord X]] and Bushkiller (including Sirus) \u2014 but many distinct scenes developed nationally.\n\nBirmingham and the West Midlands gave rise to [[Credit to the Nation]], whose MC Fusion would espouse conscious anti-racist, sexist and homophobic lyrics. The band would also find some brief mainstream success with their [[indie rock]] crossover sound. Leeds spawned [[Braintax]] and Breaking the Illusion (who together founded [[Low Life Records]]) as well as [[Nightmares on Wax]]. Greater Manchester gave birth to the [[Ruthless Rap Assassins]], Krispy 3 (later Krispy), the [[Kaliphz]], [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[MC Tunes]].\n\nBristol's scene has a long history going right back to the early '80s where links were made with outfits from New York. [[The Fearless Four (group)|The Fearless Four]] came over in 1984 along with graffiti legends the [[Tats Cru]] and [[Rock Steady Crew]].  Bristol (specifically the [[St Pauls, Bristol|St. Pauls]] area) produced The Wild Bunch (later better known as [[Massive Attack]]), [[Nellee Hooper]] who went on to produce for [[Soul II Soul]]. The city has also produced notable DMC DJs Mad Cut and DJ Quest. The city later became the home of [[trip hop]] with artists like [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].\n\n[[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] signed to a major label \u2014 [[Profile Records]], the label home of [[Run\u2013D.M.C.]] \u2014 and Kold Sweat came into their own, discovering groups like SL Troopers, [[Dynametrix]], Unanimous Decision and Katch 22, whose \"Diary of a Blackman\" was banned by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] for using a sound clip from the [[British National Front|National Front]].\n\nIn 1991, [[Hijack (hip hop group)|Hijack]] released ''The Horns of Jericho'' (Rhyme Syndicate Records, 1991) on [[Ice-T]]'s recently formed Rhyme Syndicate label. The first single, \"The Badman Is Robbin'\", was a top 40 hit and they went on sell more than 30,000 albums.\n\nBritish hip hop was affected by the record industry clamping down on [[sampling (music)|sampling]], beginning to charge for the use of samples and prosecuting those who used them without permission. Larger US acts could afford to license samples and still turn a profit for their labels, a luxury not available to many smaller UK artists. One such victim of this was [[Milton Keynes]] group [[the Criminal Minds]]. Their first two releases, the 1990 mini-album ''Guilty as Charged'' and a 1991 EP ''Tales from the Wasteland'' were bogged down by potential sample clearance problems and thus were only ever made available in small numbers, yet rate amongst some of the finest pieces of UK hip hop recorded. As [[breakbeat hardcore]] music started to become very popular in the UK in the early 1990s, the Criminal Minds turned their attention to making this type of music instead.\n\nThe UK hip hop boom never achieved its predicted commercial success. Hijack's ''The Horns of Jericho'' was never released in the US, while record companies dropped artists, citing poor sales and lack of interest. [[Mango Records]] closed down, and the British public began to turn their affections to [[Jungle music|jungle]], a fusion of breakbeat hardcore, hip hop and reggae. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them \u2014 for example [[Massive Attack]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |title=BBC News website, Massive Attack on the net |date=29 March 1998 |accessdate=2 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509115510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |archive-date=9 May 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> with [[trip hop]], or [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]], [[Us3]] and [[Urban Species]] with [[acid jazz]].\n\nIn the period between 1992 and 1995, the only groups to make much impact were Gunshot amd [[The Brotherhood (rap group)|the Brotherhood]]. \nGunshot's 1992 album ''Patriot Games'' was a landmark with tracks such as \"Mind of a Razor\" and \"World War 3\" becoming British hardcore classics.  Formed in the '80s, the Brotherhood released their first record, simply called ''Brotherhood EP'', as a white label in 1991. They went on to release ''Wayz of the Wize'' in 1992, then ''Untitled 93'' and ''XXIII'' in 1993, and ''Hip Hop N' Rap'' in 1994, all on the Bite It! label. None of the records sold in huge numbers but they managed to gain airplay on the [[Tim Westwood]] show and DJ 279's show on [[Choice FM]], gaining them a solid following across the UK. Bite It! also released tracks from artists such as Pauly Ryan and the Scientists of Sound.\n\n===New generation: Late '90s\u2013early '00s===\nFollowing an initial flurry of interest from major record labels in the 1980s, by the early 1990s the scene had moved underground after record companies pulled back. In the mid-1990s hip hop in the UK started to experiment and diversify \u2014 often mutating into different genres entirely, such as [[trip hop]] and began making inroads into the US market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |title=Q101 Top 101 of 1997 |publisher=Rocklists.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091722/http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs the old rappers left the scene, a new generation, raised on hip hop and [[electronica]], was coming of age: [[The Herbaliser]] released ''Remedies'' ([[Ninja Tune]], 1995), [[Mr. Scruff]] released the \"Frolic EP Pt 1\" (Pleasure Music, 1995), [[Mark B]] released \"Any More Questions?\" (Jazz Fudge, 1995) and [[DJ Skitz]] released \"Where My Mind Is At/Blessed Be The Manor\" (Ronin Records, 1996) featuring a young rapper called [[Roots Manuva]] on guest vocals who had previously released the single \"Next Type of Motion\" (Sound of Money, 1995).\n\nRecord labels that attempted to merge British hip hop style and sensibilities with modern dance music began to emerge, like [[Rae & Christian|Mark Rae]]'s [[Grand Central Records|Grand Central]] (home to Aim, Rae & Christian, and Fingathing, among others) or [[DJ Vadim]]'s Jazz Fudge. Increasingly, these artists managed to avoid the issues surrounding sampling by making music themselves (bands such as the [[Stereo MCs]] began playing instruments and sampling their own tunes) or searching out more obscure records where a most cost effective licensing deal could be arranged.\n\nBritish hip hop began to go through a renaissance,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/reviews/1482738.stm |title=BBC News website: British hip hop renaissance |first=Barney |last=Rowntree |date=10 August 2001 |accessdate=2 November 2006}}</ref> its style shifting from the hardcore template of its youth and moving into more melodic territory.\n\nThe Brotherhood managed to broker a major deal with Virgin Records in 1995.  Continuing their relationship with Trevor Jackson as their producer, they released 3 singles \u2018Alphabetical Response\u2019, \u2018One Shot\u2019, \u2018Punk Funk\u2019 and their album ''[[Elementalz]]'', all in 1996.  Their work was met with critical acclaim and they toured solidly with American artists including Cypress Hill, The Roots and WuTang, but big record sales seemed to be very elusive and they parted ways with Virgin in 1998.\n[[File:MF Doom The Arches 2.jpg|thumb|255x255px|MF Doom has been ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rappers-music-greatest-celebrities-tupac|title=11 Rappers Who Should Be Added To Everyones Playlists|date=2018-11-05|website=The Odyssey Online|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>]]\nIn late 1996 [[Will Ashon]] started up his new [[Ninja Tune]] backed label [[Big Dada]] and planned a roster of performers. Bandit of Birmingham's MSI/Asylum crew informed Will of [[Juice Aleem]] that he was contemplating who could truly represent the ethos of the new label. Ashon was impressed with the demo and agreed to have Aleem on board. The results of this were the first release of the now famous record label: in 1997 Juice featured on Big Dada record label's first ever release[2], \"Misanthropic\", under the pseudonym \"Alpha Prhyme\", a collaboration between himself and [[Luke Vibert]].\n\nIn 1998 [[Mark B]] and Blade released \"Hitmen for Hire EP\", which featured guest appearances from [[Lewis Parker (musician)|Lewis Parker]] and [[Mr Thing]] (of the [[Scratch Perverts]]). The EP was a success, and led to the successful 2001 album ''The Unknown'', which despite never charting in the UK top 75, was still a top 100 success and an even bigger success within its genre. Also, the album spawned the 2001 top 40 single \"Ya Don't See the Signs\", which was a remix by [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] frontman [[Grant Nicholas]], after the title track was a top 75 hit and Blade with Mark B supported Feeder. The same year, Bristol's Hombr\u00e9 label released the \"2012 EP\" from [[Aspects (band)|Aspects]], a benchmark release within the movement. [[Roots Manuva]], [[Blak Twang]], [[Mud Family]], [[Ti2bs]], [[Task Force (band)|Task Force]], [[Phi Life Cypher]], MSI & Asylum, [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[Ty (rapper)|Ty]] all came to the public's attention, while veteran acts [[Rodney P]], [[Demon Boyz|Mike J]], and MC Mell'O' returned to the scene. In 1999, MF Doom released his debut studio album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'' which has since been ranked as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.\n\n===Underground to mainstream: '00s to 2010s===\nA new generation of artists emerged following the turn of the century, including [[Jehst]], [[Skinnyman]], [[Nicky Spesh]], [[Foreign Beggars]] and Usmaan. At the same time, a new style of [[electronic music]] emerged in the early 2000s, derivative of [[UK Garage]] and [[jungle]], with influences from [[Dancehall]], [[Drum and bass]] and [[hip hop]]. The new genre was dubbed [[Grime (music)|grime]] (sometimes called eskibeat or sublow) and effectively superseded UK hip hop in both popularity and the mainstream conscious. Notable grime acts include [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], [[Lethal Bizzle]], [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Skepta]], [[Jme (musician)|Jme]], [[Jammer (rapper)|Jammer]], [[Shystie]], [[Ghetts]] and [[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]]. Grime music saw some early success in America with Wiley, Kano and Dizzee Rascal, all releasing music across the atlantic. Grime is generally considered to be distinct from hip-hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|title=Deeper Than Rap: Grime is Not a Subgenre of Hip-Hop|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914112019/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|archive-date=14 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|title=Skepta, grime and urban British youth language: a guide|last=|first=|date=|website=The Conversation|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008174156/http://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|archive-date=8 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|title=Grime is Approaching the Breakthrough Moment Hip-Hop Reached in the 90s|last=|first=|date=2016-12-21|website=Vice|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105013003/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|archive-date=5 November 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":05\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|title=Grime time: What it is and where to find it|last=|first=|date=2016-05-13|website=Standard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025044957/https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|archive-date=25 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"complex2\">{{Cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2016/06/hip-hop-dancehall-breaking-down-the-origins-of-grime/dizzee-talks-hip-hop-rosenberg|title=Hip-Hop Or Dancehall?

Amongst this new generation included artists such as [[Klashnekoff]], [[Akala (rapper)|Akala]], [[Lowkey]] and the Poisonous Poets. \n\nThe mid-2000s saw the emergence of Road rap, a genre that took influences from American gangsta rap and focused on crime, gang, or violent themes.

Loud, [[M Huncho]], Nafe Smallz, K-Trap, and [[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz) plus many more. Many of these artists gained influences from the American trap scene and deciding to add the UK sound and flavour to the genre. Many of them talk about braggadocious lifestyles they live and how it affects their music. In several interviews before, [[M Huncho]] has described his more tone-down, melodic style and moderately humbler approach when it comes to lyrics as his own derivative take on UK [[trap music]], in a genre he has personally dubbed as \"trapwave\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|work=A Nation Of Billions|title=Welcome To The TrapWave: M Huncho|date=29 May 2018|access-date=4 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604120145/https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|archive-date=4 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Wolverhampton artist [[Scarlxrd]] implements an energetic aesthetic and tone with explosively brazen screaming vocals, and dark yet reflectively intense and meaningful lyricism in an essentially self-pioneered style known as \"[[Rap metal#Trap metal|trap-metal]]\" or \"ragecore\"; a fusion of trap music and screaming vocals. Scarlxrd has cited some of his main inspirations and influences as including the likes of [[Eminem]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Travi$ Scott]] and [[Linkin Park]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|work=Kerrang|title=SCARLXRD: \"BRING ME THE HORIZON\u2019S LEGACY INSPIRES ME\"|date=27 February 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806082026/https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|archive-date=6 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|work=XXL|title=Scarlxrd Ditches YouTuber Lifestyle and His Black Mask for Screamo Success|date=25 May 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519003815/https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|archive-date=19 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSgIYzwOYw|work=PopkillerTV|title=SCARLXRD \u2013 interview: \"My style is a mix of Eminem, Travis Scott and Slipknot\" (05.2018) \u2013 YouTube|date=12 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNotable British trap artists and groups include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*6IXVI (6 Figure Music)\n*Ay Em\n*Baseman\n*Clue\n*[[D-Block Europe]]\n*Dappy\n*Fekky\n*[[Fredo (rapper)|Fredo]]\n*House of Pharaohs\n*K-Trap\n*Lancey Foux\n*[[M Huncho]]\n*Nafe Smallz\n*[[Octavian (rapper)|Octavian]]\n*S-X\n*S Loud\n*[[Scarlxrd]]\n*Sigeol\n*Skeamer\n*[[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz)\n*[[Smoke Boys]] (formerly Section Boyz)\n*Solo LDN\n*Suspect\n*TE dness\n*Young Tribez (formerly Bank Roll Young)\n*Yung Fume\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Backlash against commercialisation==\nSince grime's post-millennial boom period coincided with UK hip-hop's, the eagerly anticipated commercial breakout of the latter did not happen. Instead, acts such as [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[N-Dubz]] and [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]] were signed to major labels and their traditional sound tweaked to fit a pop sensibility. However the lineage of these, and many UK rappers, is unquestionably grime rather than UK hip-hop.\n\nThere is a common belief within the underground hip hop community that true hip hop is music relevant primarily to the disenfranchised listeners, rather than the mass market. Because of the belief that mainstream acts are paid large sums of money by the major labels to make music tailored to the current mass market, these artists often face a backlash and accusations of 'selling out' from the underground community.<ref>{{cite news|title=British hip-hop heads out of the underground|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|accessdate=10 October 2016|work=The Independent|date=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010215230/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|archive-date=10 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nThe growth of British hip hop was given a boost when in 2002, the BBC launched a digital radio station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]] devoted to \"new black music\" including hip hop, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[UK garage]], [[dancehall]], [[Grime music|grime]] and drum and bass,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |title=BBC Website: 1xtra |accessdate=1 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104060217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |archive-date=4 November 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> however 1Xtra does not play exclusively British hip hop. The cable and satellite channel, Channel AKA (formerly Channel U, now known as [[Now 70s]]) also had the profile of British hip hop and grime.\nYouTube was also a very important outlet for upcoming and significant artists. Channels include [[Link Up TV]], [[GRM Daily]], [[SB.TV]], Pressplay Media and [[Mixtape Madness]].\n\n==Women==\nWomen have contributed to hip hop's evolution in Britain from the beginning.<ref>Chang, Jeff. \"Future Shock\", \"Future Shock\", January 2004.

''[[Raw Like Sushi]]'' (1989) was solely produced by English producers and was a massive hit in both the UK and US. Cherry continues to produce and release music today.\n\nWomen in hip hop often confront a large amount of sexist stereotyping; however some female British hip hop artists such as Lady Sovereign and M.I.A. have achieved success both in the UK and US. Artists such as Kate Tempest, Ms Dynamite, M.I.A. and Speech Debelle have also become known for political and social commentary in their music. Singer, songwriter and rapper Estelle said of the difficult position of female rappers: \"I think they get a tough ride because some of them don\u2019t see themselves above and beyond the bullshit and no one\u2019s really given them that break.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Adabra|first1=Michelle|title=Interview \u2013 Estelle|url=https://www.britishhiphop.co.uk/features/interviews/estelle.html|website=www.britishhiphop.co.uk|accessdate=10 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419194856/https://www.britishhiphop.co.uk/features/interviews/estelle.html|archive-date=19 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Afroswing]]\n*[[Drill music|Drill]]\n*[[Gangsta rap]]\n*[[Grime (music)|Grime]]\n*[[Hip hop music|Hip hop]]\n*[[Trap music|Trap]]\n*[[Music of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Scottish hip hop|Scottish hip-hop]]\n*[[UK garage]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.spifftv.com Source for UK hip hop artists]\n\n{{hiphop}}\n{{Music of the United Kingdom}}\n{{Black British topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:British Hip Hop}}\n[[Category:British hip hop| ]]\n[[Category:Black British music|Hip-hop]]\n[[Category:British styles of music]]\n[[Category:Hip hop]]\n", "name_user": "Madbrad200", "label": "safe", "comment": "linking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_hip_hop"}
