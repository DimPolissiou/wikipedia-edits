Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

However, it also is rooted in [[classic country]], [[country pop]] and [[blue-eyed soul]].<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/><ref name=\"Top 5\">{{cite web |last1=Horton |first1=Carrie |title=Top 5 Jeannie Seely Songs |url=https://theboot.com/top-5-jeannie-seely-songs/ |website=The Boot |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|pp=300-02}} At times, her songs have dealt with women's sexuality, heartache, empowerment and loss.<ref name=\"Top 5\"/>{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=302}} ''The Boot'' writer Carrie Horton highlighted how Seely's music has focused on women's sexual desires. Horton noted that Seely's signature tune, \"Don't Touch\", was controversial due to its lyric. \"'Don't Touch Me' caused quite a stir upon its release as one of the first country songs featuring a woman expressing sexual desire. Proving that women can sing about sex too...\"<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Horton also explained that her material could be considered classic country. Songs such as \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" and \"A Wanderin' Man\" fused \"honky tonk\" and \"traditional country\" with modern arrangements, according to Horton.<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Seely has frequently been nicknamed \"Miss Country Soul\" for her stylistic choices related to the blue-eyed soul genre. In a 2017 interview, Seely explained how she acquired the nickname. \"...as I left the radio station he\u2019d visited, the disc jockey played my record 'Don\u2019t Touch Me' and he back-announced it saying \u2018that\u2019s the blue-eyed soul of Miss Country Soul Jeannie Seely\u2019 and Ed really liked the sound and the feel of that and it so it kinda stuck,\" she commented.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive Interview with Country Legend Jeannie Seely |url=https://www.grizzlyrose.com/interview-jeannie-seely/ |website=Grizzly Rose |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeely has been influenced mostly by artists in the country music genre. She noted that [[Patsy Cline]], [[Jean Shepard]] and [[Kitty Wells]] all were important female inspirations. She also cited [[Little Jimmy Dickens]] and [[Ernest Tubb]] as influences. Seely also said that she was inspired by [[Rosemary Clooney]] and [[Patti Page]] as a young child.{{sfn|Homer, Sheree|2019|p=41}}\n\nSeely's voice has also been of interest to writers and critics when discussing her artistry. Some writers have noted the emotion in her vocal delivery. [[Ken Burns]] of [[PBS]] called Seely's voice \"emotion packed\" in his biography of her music and career.<ref name=\"PBS\"/> John Lupton of ''Country Standard Time'' called her voice \"distinctive and raspy\".<ref name=\"Country Standard Time\"/> Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann considered Seely to be an example of the \"heartache/victim singers\" of the 1960s and 1970s. Bufwack and Oermann compared her voice to that of [[Connie Smith]], Dottie West and [[Tammy Wynette]]. \"Jeannie's husky cigarette-stained voice moaned with such agony that she was dubbed 'Miss Country Soul'\", they wrote.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} Other journalists had differed opinions. Greg Adams of Allmusic considered her voice to resemble that of a \"pop-oriented\" singer rather than country. Nonetheless, he still considered her voice to be country. \"...today she seems like [[Kitty Wells]] compared to some of the pure pop that has since passed for country,\" Adams wrote.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Greg |title=''Thanks, Hank!'' -- Jeannie Seely -- Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/thanks-hank%21-mw0000967234 |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Image===\nAs a performer and entertainer, Seely's image has often been a subject of discussion. On the Grand Ole Opry, she became the first artist to wear a [[miniskirt]] on stage.<ref name=\"PBS\"/> In the PBS documentary, ''[[Country Music (miniseries)|Country Music]]'', Seely recalled having a confrontation with Opry manager Ott Devine following an early Opry performance. In his office, she convinced Devine to wear a miniskirt regularly. \"Okay, this is what America is wearing and I\u2019ll make you a deal. I won\u2019t wear a miniskirt in the back door if you don\u2019t let anybody wear one in the front door,\" she told him.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burns |first1=Ken |title=''Country Music'' (The Sons and Daughters of America) |journal=[[PBS]] |date=September 2019}}</ref> Seely was also among the first female artists to wear other contemporary fashion items, including [[go-go boot]]s, [[pantsuit]]s and [[jeans|denim jeans]]. Prior to Seely, many female country performers entertained in [[gingham|gingham]] and wore dresses on stage. According to Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann, Seely \"broke the Opry's gingham curtain\". Seely later reflected on her choice of stage attire. \"I never planned to set any sort of trend. I'm about like any other normal American girl my age. I think I dress and act pretty much the way she does,\" she recalled.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=302}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Titusville Bank Display.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An honorary display of Seely inside the original Titusville Trust Company building. As a young adult, Seely worked for the trust company full-time.]]\nSeely has been described as a influential female country artist. According to authors Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann, Seely's stage presence and personality was unlike that of her predecessors. \"When she arrived in Nashville in 1965, women were still expected to portray the submissive country sweetheart. Jeannie blazed a nonconformist trail from the moment she hit the Opry stage in her mini skirt.\"{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} Carrie Horton of ''The Boot'' called her career \"prolific\" and \"influential\". \"From her success as a songwriter to her popularity as a duet partner to her influence as a solo artist, Seely's work has impacted generations of country, Americana and bluegrass performers,\" Horton commented.<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Kevin John Coyne of ''Country Universe'' called her, \"one of the most forceful personalities on the country music scene since she had her first big hit in 1966.\"<ref name=\"Country Universe\"/> Edward Morris of ''[[Country Music Television]]'' called her \"one of the Opry\u2019s most applauded performers.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Edward |title=Women\u2019s History Month: These Artists Thrived in the \u201950s and \u201960s |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1818877/womens-history-month-these-artists-thrived-in-the-50s-and-60s/ |website=[[Country Music Television]] |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nHer music has also been an influence on other female country artists.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years.

However, it also is rooted in [[classic country]], [[country pop]] and [[blue-eyed soul]].<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/><ref name=\"Top 5\">{{cite web |last1=Horton |first1=Carrie |title=Top 5 Jeannie Seely Songs |url=https://theboot.com/top-5-jeannie-seely-songs/ |website=The Boot |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|pp=300-02}} At times, her songs have dealt with women's sexuality, heartache, empowerment and loss.<ref name=\"Top 5\"/>{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=302}} ''The Boot'' writer Carrie Horton highlighted how Seely's music has focused on women's sexual desires. Horton noted that Seely's signature tune, \"Don't Touch\", was controversial due to its lyric. \"'Don't Touch Me' caused quite a stir upon its release as one of the first country songs featuring a woman expressing sexual desire. Proving that women can sing about sex too...\"<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Horton also explained that her material could be considered classic country. Songs such as \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" and \"A Wanderin' Man\" fused \"honky tonk\" and \"traditional country\" with modern arrangements, according to Horton.<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Seely has frequently been nicknamed \"Miss Country Soul\" for her stylistic choices related to the blue-eyed soul genre. In a 2017 interview, Seely explained how she acquired the nickname. \"...as I left the radio station he\u2019d visited, the disc jockey played my record 'Don\u2019t Touch Me' and he back-announced it saying \u2018that\u2019s the blue-eyed soul of Miss Country Soul Jeannie Seely\u2019 and Ed really liked the sound and the feel of that and it so it kinda stuck,\" she commented.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive Interview with Country Legend Jeannie Seely |url=https://www.grizzlyrose.com/interview-jeannie-seely/ |website=Grizzly Rose |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeely has been influenced mostly by artists in the country music genre. She noted that [[Patsy Cline]], [[Jean Shepard]] and [[Kitty Wells]] all were important female inspirations. She also cited [[Little Jimmy Dickens]] and [[Ernest Tubb]] as influences. Seely also said that she was inspired by [[Rosemary Clooney]] and [[Patti Page]] as a young child.{{sfn|Homer, Sheree|2019|p=41}}\n\nSeely's voice has also been of interest to writers and critics when discussing her artistry. Some writers have noted the emotion in her vocal delivery. [[Ken Burns]] of [[PBS]] called Seely's voice \"emotion packed\" in his biography of her music and career.<ref name=\"PBS\"/> John Lupton of ''Country Standard Time'' called her voice \"distinctive and raspy\".<ref name=\"Country Standard Time\"/> Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann considered Seely to be an example of the \"heartache/victim singers\" of the 1960s and 1970s. Bufwack and Oermann compared her voice to that of [[Connie Smith]], Dottie West and [[Tammy Wynette]]. \"Jeannie's husky cigarette-stained voice moaned with such agony that she was dubbed 'Miss Country Soul'\", they wrote.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} Other journalists had differed opinions. Greg Adams of Allmusic considered her voice to resemble that of a \"pop-oriented\" singer rather than country. Nonetheless, he still considered her voice to be country. \"...today she seems like [[Kitty Wells]] compared to some of the pure pop that has since passed for country,\" Adams wrote.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Greg |title=''Thanks, Hank!'' -- Jeannie Seely -- Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/thanks-hank%21-mw0000967234 |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Image===\nAs a performer and entertainer, Seely's image has often been a subject of discussion. On the Grand Ole Opry, she became the first artist to wear a [[miniskirt]] on stage.<ref name=\"PBS\"/> In the PBS documentary, ''[[Country Music (miniseries)|Country Music]]'', Seely recalled having a confrontation with Opry manager Ott Devine following an early Opry performance. In his office, she convinced Devine to wear a miniskirt regularly. \"Okay, this is what America is wearing and I\u2019ll make you a deal. I won\u2019t wear a miniskirt in the back door if you don\u2019t let anybody wear one in the front door,\" she told him.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burns |first1=Ken |title=''Country Music'' (The Sons and Daughters of America) |journal=[[PBS]] |date=September 2019}}</ref> Seely was also among the first female artists to wear other contemporary fashion items, including [[go-go boot]]s, [[pantsuit]]s and [[jeans|denim jeans]]. Prior to Seely, many female country performers entertained in [[gingham|gingham]] and wore dresses on stage. According to Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann, Seely \"broke the Opry's gingham curtain\". Seely later reflected on her choice of stage attire. \"I never planned to set any sort of trend. I'm about like any other normal American girl my age. I think I dress and act pretty much the way she does,\" she recalled.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=302}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Titusville Bank Display.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An honorary display of Seely inside the original Titusville Trust Company building. As a young adult, Seely worked for the trust company full-time.]]\nSeely has been described as a influential female country artist. According to authors Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann, Seely's stage presence and personality was unlike that of her predecessors. \"When she arrived in Nashville in 1965, women were still expected to portray the submissive country sweetheart. Jeannie blazed a nonconformist trail from the moment she hit the Opry stage in her mini skirt.\"{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} Carrie Horton of ''The Boot'' called her career \"prolific\" and \"influential\". \"From her success as a songwriter to her popularity as a duet partner to her influence as a solo artist, Seely's work has impacted generations of country, Americana and bluegrass performers,\" Horton commented.<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Kevin John Coyne of ''Country Universe'' called her, \"one of the most forceful personalities on the country music scene since she had her first big hit in 1966.\"<ref name=\"Country Universe\"/> Edward Morris of ''[[Country Music Television]]'' called her \"one of the Opry\u2019s most applauded performers.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Edward |title=Women\u2019s History Month: These Artists Thrived in the \u201950s and \u201960s |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1818877/womens-history-month-these-artists-thrived-in-the-50s-and-60s/ |website=[[Country Music Television]] |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nHer music has also been an influence on other female country artists. Lorrie Morgan has considered Seely to be influence on her music. In a 2017 interview, Morgan called her \"a great lady and a very good friend of mine.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morgan |first1=Kim Kyle |title=Six questions with country music star Lorrie Morgan: Concert this Friday in The Woodlands |url=https://www.woodlandsonline.com/npps/story.cfm?nppage=59351 |website=Woodlands Online |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref> [[Barbara Mandrell]] has also cited her as an influence.{{sfn|Homer, Sheree|2019|p=40}} [[Carly Pearce]] is a third female artist that has sought inspiration from Seely. \"I dreamt of singing in the Grand Ole Opry my whole life.

In 2017, Seely celebrated 50 years as a member of the Grand Ole Opry. She was among several women who have since been a member for 50 years. Among those have been [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Dolly Parton]]. \"The Opry has been my life for more than 50 years. I feel so blessed to be a part of this Opry family.

The third episode premiered on 1 September, and featured auditions from Glasgow, Birmingham and Cardiff.

Bootcamp was broadcast over a two-part show on Saturday 29 September. Episode 7 showed the first round at the [[Heythrop Park]] Hotel in [[Oxfordshire]], where the acts were whittled down to 12 in each category (48 acts in total). The next episode, showing the second round at the [[Apollo Theatre]] in London, was screened a few hours later. Here the acts were further reduced to six in each category \u2013 a total of 24 acts. After this, the judges were told which category they were to mentor. Cowell was given the Groups, Minogue was given the Boys, Osbourne was given the Girls and Walsh was given the Over 25s.\n\n===Judges' houses===\nIn the \"judges' houses\" round, each judge chose three of their remaining six acts to go forward and represent them on the live shows.<ref name=\"about\"/> The locations for the round were confirmed during episode 8 on 29 September; they were later revealed by Louis Walsh not to be the judges' real homes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7040283.stm|title=Walsh's X Factor house 'not his'|publisher=BBC News|date=11 October 2007|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> Cowell took his six acts to [[Marbella]]; Osbourne to Los Angeles; Walsh to [[Dublin]]; and Minogue to [[Ibiza]].<ref name=\"Dannii's delight\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/14099/Dannii-s-delight-/|title=Dannii's delight|work=Daily Star|date=30 August 2007|accessdate=30 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/xfactor/a74746/minogue-to-visit-ibiza-for-x-factor.html|title=Minogue to visit Ibiza for 'X Factor'|work=Digital Spy|date=30 August 2007|accessdate=31 August 2007}}</ref> As in previous series, the judges were joined by an assistant to help them make their decisions: Cowell was joined by former pop star [[Sinitta]]; Osbourne by [[The Pussycat Dolls]] lead singer [[Nicole Scherzinger]]; Walsh by [[Westlife]] singer [[Kian Egan]]; and Minogue by songwriter and producer [[Terry Ronald]].\n\nThe judges' houses stage was broadcast over a two-part weekend special. Episode 9 was shown on Saturday  6 October where all 24 acts performed for a place in their mentor's top three and, subsequently, the live shows. The final twelve were revealed the day after on Sunday 7 October in a special Sunday episode.

This was because of ITV's coverage of the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. Ironically, 20 October 2007 also saw the [[2007 Rugby World Cup Final|final]] of the tournament take place in Paris, France. Dermot O'Leary mentioned ITV's broadcast of the game at the end of Live Show 1.\n\nSeries 4 saw the continuation of the themed live show format, in which the acts sing songs according to a different musical theme or genre each week. This format was introduced in series 3. Each week a celebrity guest connected to the theme performed in the results show, and some of the guests \u2013 [[C\u00e9line Dion]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Girls Aloud]] and [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]] \u2013 also coached the acts in rehearsal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/x-factor-feud-continues-514815|title=X Factor feud continues|work=Daily Mirror|date=20 October 2007|accessdate=20 October 2007}}</ref> [[The X Factor (British series 3)|Series 3]] winner, [[Leona Lewis]], appeared as a guest on the first live show on 20 October. During the results show she performed a [[premiere]] of her new single, \"[[Bleeding Love]]\", from her debut album, ''[[Spirit (Leona Lewis album)|Spirit]]''. [[The X Factor (British series 2)|Series 2]] winner, [[Shayne Ward]], also appeared as a guest on the fourth live show. He performed his latest single, \"[[Breathless (Shayne Ward song)|Breathless]]\", from his [[Breathless (Shayne Ward album)|second album of the same]] name during the results show on 10 November. [[Westlife]] appeared on the sixth live show on 24 November singing \"[[I'm Already There]]\" from their 2007 album ''[[Back Home (Westlife album)|Back Home]]''. [[Duran Duran]] sang \"[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]\" and \"[[Nite-Runner]]\" during the seventh live show results on 1 December.\n\nThe rules relating to judges' votes in the results show changed from previous series. In the past, the decision as to which act was sent home each week was made by the three judges (from which there would always be a majority). Now, with four judges, if there was a two-way tie (billed on the show as \"deadlock\") the act with the fewest votes from the public would be eliminated, otherwise the judges' decision would stand.\n\nWith the appointment of Friedman as choreographer, finalists used dance routines more frequently during their live performances in comparison to previous series.\n\nThree acts (previously two for series 1 and 3) competed in the final for the \u00a31&nbsp;million recording contract.<ref name=\"Dannii's delight\"/>\n\nContrary to reports about a change of venue, the live shows for this series continued to be broadcast from [[The Fountain Studios]]. Unlike past series there was no dramatic change in the [[Set construction|set]], only minor alterations and space created for a larger audience.\n\nIt was reported that the producers of the show hired a counsellor to help the contestants deal with the pressure of appearing in the live shows each week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/xfactor/a79623/x-factor-chiefs-hire-counsellor-for-singers.html|title='X Factor' chiefs hire counsellor for singers|work=Digital Spy|date=11 November 2007|accessdate=11 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Results summary===\n;Colour key\n{|\n|-\n|{{Color box|#87D3F8;|border=darkgray}}&nbsp;\u2013||Contestant was in the bottom two and had to sing again in the final showdown\n|-\n|{{Color box|pink;|border=darkgray}}&nbsp;\u2013||Contestant received the fewest public votes and was immediately eliminated (no final showdown)\n|-\n|{{Color box|lightgreen;|border=darkgray}}&nbsp;\u2013||Contestant won the competition \n|-\n|}\n<!-- Please do not overuse colour in this table - especially to signify mentors and categories, as this has been established in the above table -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n|+Weekly results per act\n!style=\"width:13%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | Act\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 1 (20 October)|Week 1]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 2 (27 October)|Week 2]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 3 (3 November)|Week 3]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 4 (10 November)|Week 4]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 5 (17 November)|Week 5]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 6 (24 November)|Week 6]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 7 (1 December)|Quarter-Final]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 8: Semi-Final (8 December)|Semi-Final]]\n!colspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 9: Final (15 December)|Final]]\n|-\n!style=\"width:7%\" scope=\"col\" | First Vote \n!style=\"width:7%\" scope=\"col\" | Second Vote\n|-\n!

The third episode premiered on 1 September, and featured auditions from Glasgow, Birmingham and Cardiff.

Bootcamp was broadcast over a two-part show on Saturday 29 September. Episode 7 showed the first round at the [[Heythrop Park]] Hotel in [[Oxfordshire]], where the acts were whittled down to 12 in each category (48 acts in total). The next episode, showing the second round at the [[Apollo Theatre]] in London, was screened a few hours later. Here the acts were further reduced to six in each category \u2013 a total of 24 acts. After this, the judges were told which category they were to mentor. Cowell was given the Groups, Minogue was given the Boys, Osbourne was given the Girls and Walsh was given the Over 25s.\n\n===Judges' houses===\nIn the \"judges' houses\" round, each judge chose three of their remaining six acts to go forward and represent them on the live shows.<ref name=\"about\"/> The locations for the round were confirmed during episode 8 on 29 September; they were later revealed by Louis Walsh not to be the judges' real homes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7040283.stm|title=Walsh's X Factor house 'not his'|publisher=BBC News|date=11 October 2007|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> Cowell took his six acts to [[Marbella]]; Osbourne to Los Angeles; Walsh to [[Dublin]]; and Minogue to [[Ibiza]].<ref name=\"Dannii's delight\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/14099/Dannii-s-delight-/|title=Dannii's delight|work=Daily Star|date=30 August 2007|accessdate=30 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/xfactor/a74746/minogue-to-visit-ibiza-for-x-factor.html|title=Minogue to visit Ibiza for 'X Factor'|work=Digital Spy|date=30 August 2007|accessdate=31 August 2007}}</ref> As in previous series, the judges were joined by an assistant to help them make their decisions: Cowell was joined by former pop star [[Sinitta]]; Osbourne by [[The Pussycat Dolls]] lead singer [[Nicole Scherzinger]]; Walsh by [[Westlife]] singer [[Kian Egan]]; and Minogue by songwriter and producer [[Terry Ronald]].\n\nThe judges' houses stage was broadcast over a two-part weekend special. Episode 9 was shown on Saturday  6 October where all 24 acts performed for a place in their mentor's top three and, subsequently, the live shows. The final twelve were revealed the day after on Sunday 7 October in a special Sunday episode.

This was because of ITV's coverage of the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. Ironically, 20 October 2007 also saw the [[2007 Rugby World Cup Final|final]] of the tournament take place in Paris, France. Dermot O'Leary mentioned ITV's broadcast of the game at the end of Live Show 1.\n\nSeries 4 saw the continuation of the themed live show format, in which the acts sing songs according to a different musical theme or genre each week. This format was introduced in series 3. Each week a celebrity guest connected to the theme performed in the results show, and some of the guests \u2013 [[C\u00e9line Dion]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Girls Aloud]] and [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]] \u2013 also coached the acts in rehearsal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/x-factor-feud-continues-514815|title=X Factor feud continues|work=Daily Mirror|date=20 October 2007|accessdate=20 October 2007}}</ref> [[The X Factor (British series 3)|Series 3]] winner, [[Leona Lewis]], appeared as a guest on the first live show on 20 October. During the results show she performed a [[premiere]] of her new single, \"[[Bleeding Love]]\", from her debut album, ''[[Spirit (Leona Lewis album)|Spirit]]''. [[The X Factor (British series 2)|Series 2]] winner, [[Shayne Ward]], also appeared as a guest on the fourth live show. He performed his latest single, \"[[Breathless (Shayne Ward song)|Breathless]]\", from his [[Breathless (Shayne Ward album)|second album of the same]] name during the results show on 10 November. [[Westlife]] appeared on the sixth live show on 24 November singing \"[[I'm Already There]]\" from their 2007 album ''[[Back Home (Westlife album)|Back Home]]''. [[Duran Duran]] sang \"[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]\" and \"[[Nite-Runner]]\" during the seventh live show results on 1 December.\n\nThe rules relating to judges' votes in the results show changed from previous series. In the past, the decision as to which act was sent home each week was made by the three judges (from which there would always be a majority). Now, with four judges, if there was a two-way tie (billed on the show as \"deadlock\") the act with the fewest votes from the public would be eliminated, otherwise the judges' decision would stand.\n\nWith the appointment of Friedman as choreographer, finalists used dance routines more frequently during their live performances in comparison to previous series.\n\nThree acts (previously two for series 1 and 3) competed in the final for the \u00a31&nbsp;million recording contract.<ref name=\"Dannii's delight\"/>\n\nContrary to reports about a change of venue, the live shows for this series continued to be broadcast from [[The Fountain Studios]]. Unlike past series there was no dramatic change in the [[Set construction|set]], only minor alterations and space created for a larger audience.\n\nIt was reported that the producers of the show hired a counsellor to help the contestants deal with the pressure of appearing in the live shows each week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/xfactor/a79623/x-factor-chiefs-hire-counsellor-for-singers.html|title='X Factor' chiefs hire counsellor for singers|work=Digital Spy|date=11 November 2007|accessdate=11 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Results summary===\n;Colour key\n{|\n|-\n|{{Color box|#87D3F8;|border=darkgray}}&nbsp;\u2013||Contestant was in the bottom two and had to sing again in the final showdown\n|-\n|{{Color box|pink;|border=darkgray}}&nbsp;\u2013||Contestant received the fewest public votes and was immediately eliminated (no final showdown)\n|-\n|{{Color box|lightgreen;|border=darkgray}}&nbsp;\u2013||Contestant won the competition \n|-\n|}\n<!-- Please do not overuse colour in this table - especially to signify mentors and categories, as this has been established in the above table -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n|+Weekly results per act\n!style=\"width:13%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | Act\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 1 (20 October)|Week 1]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 2 (27 October)|Week 2]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 3 (3 November)|Week 3]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 4 (10 November)|Week 4]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 5 (17 November)|Week 5]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 6 (24 November)|Week 6]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 7 (1 December)|Quarter-Final]]\n!style=\"width:7%\" rowspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 8: Semi-Final (8 December)|Semi-Final]]\n!colspan=2 scope=\"col\" | [[#Week 9: Final (15 December)|Final]]\n|-\n!style=\"width:7%\" scope=\"col\" | First Vote \n!style=\"width:7%\" scope=\"col\" | Second Vote\n|-\n!

Two months later, he was promoted again, to [[warrant officer|warrant officer, 2nd class]], before being sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].{{sfn|Gliddon|2014|p=90}}\n\nCrichton was now serving with the 1st Field Bakery,{{sfn|Gliddon|2014|p=90}} which was part of the NZASC Divisional Train supplying the [[New Zealand Division]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shoebridge |first1=Tim |last2=Phipps |first2=Gareth |title=Army Service Corps: Supply and Administrative Units |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/supply-and-administrative-units/army-service-corps |website=New Zealand History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref> The Field Bakery numbered 92 personnel, many of whom had no experience, and was initially stationed at Rouen. It was required to produce 25,000 bread rations. As the bakers gained expertise, their output increased. By 1917, the numbers of personnel had been reduced through sickness. With no reinforcements, the burden on the remaining bakers increased. They later moved to La Mengate and then L'Hallobeau to support the troops during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]].{{sfn|Millen|1997|pp=118\u2013120}}\n[[File:Men inside the 1st NZ Field Bakery (21039823513).jpg|thumb|right|Men of the Field Bakery at work, 1918]]\nIn May 1918, having served with the 1st Field Bakery for over three years, Crichton wanted a transfer to serve with the infantry and experience frontline action. He relinquished his rank as a warrant officer and was posted to the infantry. He later stated that he had been selected for officer training with the NZASC, but a senior officer in the [[Auckland Infantry Regiment]] offered to arrange his transfer if permission was obtained. It was made clear to him that he would be reduced in rank if he proceeded with the transfer. Initially placed in the 3rd Entrenching Battalion, one of the training units of the New Zealand Division, he was transferred to the Auckland Infantry Regiment and posted to its 2nd Battalion with the rank of [[private (rank)|private]] in late August 1918.{{sfn|Gliddon|2014|p=90}}  \n\nOn 30 September 1918, during the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], Crichton's platoon was trying to force a crossing of the Scheldt River, near [[Cr\u00e8vec\u0153ur-sur-l'Escaut|Cr\u00e8vec\u0153ur]], when it came under machine-gun fire.  With several men killed, including the platoon commander and senior non-commissioned officer, Crichton and the remnants of the platoon were trapped on an island in the middle of the river. The bridge leading to Cr\u00e8vec\u0153ur was wired for demolition. Despite a foot wound, Crichton volunteered to inform company headquarters of the platoon's situation.{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|p=173}} \n\nFully clothed, Crichton swam the river and despite being exposed to German gunfire as he made his way up the bank, he was able to make his report to the company's commander. He then returned to the trapped platoon, carrying a message to hold on for reinforcements. While waiting assistance from other units, Crichton decided to deal with the demolition charges on the bridges and took out the fuses and detonators. While doing so, he was exposed to gunfire from German snipers.{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|p=173}}\n\nAfter he returned to his company commander to report his successful deactivation of the demolition charges, Crichton attempted to re-join his platoon but was ordered to remain behind at company headquarters. He then assisted stretcher bearers transporting wounded soldiers before the gravity of his wounds became apparent and he was taken, despite his protests, to a field hospital.{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|p=173}} He was later evacuated to England for further treatment.{{sfn|Gliddon|2014|p=91}} Promoted to sergeant, he was still recovering from his wounds when the war ended.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=128}}\n\nCrichton was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) for his deeds of 30 September 1918.{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|p=173}} The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on a soldier of the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=558\u2013559}} The citation for his VC read:\n{{Quote|For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty when, although wounded in the foot, he continued with the advancing troops despite difficult canal and river obstacles. When his platoon was subsequently forced back by a counterattack he succeeded in carrying a message which involved swimming a river and crossing an area swept by machine-gun fire, subsequently rejoining his platoon. Later he undertook on his own initiative to save a bridge which had been mined, and, though under close fire of machine-guns and snipers, he succeeded in removing the charges, returning with the fuses and detonators.

The land the Liberty National lies upon has a unique and storied history including an ammunition depot during World War I, and a prisoner of war camp during World War II, and more recently as an oil refinery and warehouse for industrial goods. However, the land when Fireman originally toured the site was \u201ca toxic moonscape of corroded oil tanks, contaminated soil, and rusting warehouses.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/24/golf-barclays-pga-lifestyle-sports-golf-liberty-national.html|title=Inside A $250 Million Golf Course|last=Bertoni|first=Steven|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \u201cI loved the site and the historical value with the Statue of Liberty, and the city, and it was on the water,\u201d Fireman says. \u201cI just plunged into it because I thought it would be a phenomenal golf site and improve the world.

Liberty National also hosts junior golf tournaments, the First Tee of New Jersey, and local high school golf teams from Jersey City practice and play their home matches at the course.  \n\n==Philanthropy==\n\nThe Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation was created in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=www.ppffound.org/about/|title=The Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since its inception, the foundation has distributed over $165 million to charitable organizations with a focus primarily on improving the communities of both Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\nAddressing homelessness has been a major initiative of the foundation.

Later acquisitions included [[Boston Whaler]] and The Hockey Company ([[CCM (ice hockey)|CCM]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/reebok-to-buy-ccm-jofa-koho-brands-in-329-million-us-takeover-1.474982|title=Reebok to buy CCM, Jofa, Koho brands in $329 million US takeover|last=|first=|date=April 8, 2004|website=CBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.

He worked diligently to improve human rights worldwide. In 1986, Reebok became one of the first companies to pull out of South Africa because of the country's practice of [[apartheid]] and two years later Reebok sponsored the Amnesty International Human Rights Now tour. Fireman subsequently established the annual Reebok Human Rights Awards in 1988 recognizing activists under the age of 30 who exposed and reduced human rights atrocities.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fireman|first=Paul|title=From the Pain Come the Dream: The Recipients of the Reebok Human Rights Award|publisher=Umbrage|year=2003|isbn=1884167357|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFireman sold Reebok to [[Adidas]] in 2005.<ref name=\"healy\">{{cite news|last1=Healy|first1=Beth|title=Paul Fireman takes another shot|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2011/06/10/reebok_founder_fireman_returns_to_sneaker_business_with_20m_stake_in_colorado_firm/|accessdate=18 October 2015|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=10 June 2011}}</ref> He is currently the Chairman of Fireman Capital Partners, a Boston-based, consumer-focused private equity firm founded in 2008 with his son Dan, the firm\u2019s Managing Partner.<ref name=\"healy\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firemancapital.com/team/dan-fireman/|title=Dan Fireman {{!}} Fireman Capital Partners {{!}} Boston Massachusetts|website=www.firemancapital.com|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \n\n==Golf Course Development==\n\nFireman has been active in golf course development and in 1991 he purchased Willowbend Country Club ([[Mashpee, Massachusetts|Mashpee, MA]]). The development of additional courses followed that included Rio Mar Resort and Country Club ([[Puerto Rico]]), Costa Caribe Golf and Country Club (Puerto Rico), Coco Beach Golf and Country Club (Puerto Rico), The Ranch Golf Club ([[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick, MA]]), and Starr Pass Club ([[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson, AZ]]).<ref name=\"rynecki\" />\n \n[[Liberty National Golf Club]] ([[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City, NJ]]) is Fireman\u2019s most impressive foray in to the world of golf. In 1995 Fireman purchased a mile of neglected and decaying New Jersey shoreline along the Hudson River that was an eyesore. The land the Liberty National lies upon has a unique and storied history including an ammunition depot during World War I, and a prisoner of war camp during World War II, and more recently as an oil refinery and warehouse for industrial goods. However, the land when Fireman originally toured the site was \u201ca toxic moonscape of corroded oil tanks, contaminated soil, and rusting warehouses.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/24/golf-barclays-pga-lifestyle-sports-golf-liberty-national.html|title=Inside A $250 Million Golf Course|last=Bertoni|first=Steven|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \u201cI loved the site and the historical value with the Statue of Liberty, and the city, and it was on the water,\u201d Fireman says. \u201cI just plunged into it because I thought it would be a phenomenal golf site and improve the world.

Liberty National also hosts junior golf tournaments, the First Tee of New Jersey, and local high school golf teams from Jersey City practice and play their home matches at the course.  \n\n==Philanthropy==\n\nThe Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation was created in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=www.ppffound.org/about/|title=The Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since its inception, the foundation has distributed over $165 million to charitable organizations with a focus primarily on improving the communities of both Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\nAddressing homelessness has been a major initiative of the foundation. One Family Inc. was created to preventing family homelessness through advocacy, education, and innovation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=www.onefamilyinc.org|title=One Family, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Using a multi-pronged approach, One Family advocates for public policies that will increase affordable housing and provide services to families experiencing or who are at risk for homelessness with an aim to promote permanent solutions to homelessness. The Paul and Phyllis Fireman Foundation also joined with other donors to create Home Funders, a collaborative fund that finances very affordable rental housing for low-income families in Massachusetts.\n\nFireman is a strong supporter of [[The First Tee]] whose mission is to impact the lives of young people by providing educational programs that build character, instill life-enhancing values and promote healthy habits through the game of golf.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prweb.com/releases/The_First_Tee/Fireman_Donation/prweb12989117.htm|title=Paul and Dan Fireman Show Support For The First Tee Chapters of New Jersey With a Unique Donation|website=PRWeb|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.hunter-pr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TFT-NJ-Mentees.pdf|title=Paul Fireman Meets Mentees from New Jersey First Tee Chapters|date=May 12, 2016|work=Hunter Public Relations|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping through the United States, the Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation rapidly acted in March 2020 by making impactful donations to the Massachusetts COVID-19 Relief Fund<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macovid19relieffund.org/|title=Massachusetts COVID-19 Relief Fund|website=www.macovid19relieffund.org|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>, the Boston Resiliency Fund<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boston.gov/departments/treasury/boston-resiliency-fund|title=Boston Resiliency Fund|date=2020-03-16|website=Boston.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>, the Jersey City COVID-19 Response Fund, and the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund. \n[[File:Paul and Phyllis Fireman after donating Bullard Thermal Imaging Cameras to the Brockton City Firefighters.jpg|thumb|Paul and Phyllis Fireman after donating Bullard Thermal Imaging Cameras to the Brockton City Fire Department in 2000. |alt=]]\n\n==Awards==\n\nThe Academy of Achievement\u2019s Golden Plate Award, 1987\n\nThurgood Marshall Corporate Leadership Award\n\nNortheastern University Commencement Speaker and Honorary Degree, Doctor of Humanities, 1990<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.northeastern.edu/services/archives-special-collections/northeastern-history/commencement-speakers-honorary-degrees|title=Commencement Speakers & Honorary Degrees {{!}} Northeastern University Library|website=library.northeastern.edu|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nBabson College, Honorary Degree, LL.D.
