Built over the [[Pahrali River]] (also called Parazhiyar), it takes its name from Mathoor, a hamlet near the aqueduct, which is about 3 kilometres from [[Thiruvattar]] town and about 60&nbsp;km from [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]], the southernmost town of India. It is one of the longest and highest aqueducts in South Asia{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} and is a popular tourist spot in Kanyakumari District. The nearest railway station is Kuzhithurai Railway Station which is about 15 kilometres away and the nearest airport is the Trivandrum International Airport which is about 70 kilometres away.\n\n==Purpose==\nMathoor Aqueduct was constructed in 1966 by the then [[Chief Minister]] of Tamil Nadu,Honorable Chief Minister Kamarajar , as a drought relief measure across the river Pahrali.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Its purpose is to  carry water for irrigation from an elevated level of one hill to another. The irrigation water feeds the taluks of [[Vilavancode]] and [[Kalkulam]].\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Mathur Aqueduct.JPG|thumb|right|Mathur Aqueduct - one of the largest aqueducts in Asia]]\nThe aqueduct is built across the Parali river, a small river that originates in the [[Mahendragiri Hills]] of the [[Western Ghats]]. Mathoor Aqueduct itself carries water of the Pattanamkal canal for irrigation  over the Parali, from one hill to another, for a distance of close to one kilometer. This aqueduct is needed because of the undulating land terrain of the area, which is also adjacent to the hills of the Western Ghats.\n\nMathoor Aqueduct is a concrete structure supported by 28 huge pillars, the maximum height of the pillars reaching 115&nbsp;ft. The trough structure is 7&nbsp;ft in height, with a width of 7.5&nbsp;ft. The trough is partly covered with concrete slabs, allowing people to walk on the bridge and to see the water going through the trough.

Built over the [[Pahrali River]] (also called Parazhiyar), it takes its name from Mathoor, a hamlet near the aqueduct, which is about 3 kilometres from [[Thiruvattar]] town and about 60&nbsp;km from [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]], the southernmost town of India. It is one of the longest and highest aqueducts in South Asia{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} and is a popular tourist spot in Kanyakumari District. The nearest railway station is Kuzhithurai Railway Station which is about 15 kilometres away and the nearest airport is the Trivandrum International Airport which is about 70 kilometres away.\n\n==Purpose==\nMathoor Aqueduct was constructed in 1966 by the then [[Chief Minister]] of Tamil Nadu,Honorable Chief Minister Kamarajar , as a drought relief measure across the river Pahrali.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Its purpose is to  carry water for irrigation from an elevated level of one hill to another. The irrigation water feeds the taluks of [[Vilavancode]] and [[Kalkulam]].\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Mathur Aqueduct.JPG|thumb|right|Mathur Aqueduct - one of the largest aqueducts in Asia]]\nThe aqueduct is built across the Parali river, a small river that originates in the [[Mahendragiri Hills]] of the [[Western Ghats]]. Mathoor Aqueduct itself carries water of the Pattanamkal canal for irrigation  over the Parali, from one hill to another, for a distance of close to one kilometer. This aqueduct is needed because of the undulating land terrain of the area, which is also adjacent to the hills of the Western Ghats.\n\nMathoor Aqueduct is a concrete structure supported by 28 huge pillars, the maximum height of the pillars reaching 115&nbsp;ft. The trough structure is 7&nbsp;ft in height, with a width of 7.5&nbsp;ft. The trough is partly covered with concrete slabs, allowing people to walk on the bridge and to see the water going through the trough. Some of the pillars are set in rocks of the Pahrali river, though some of the pillars are set in hills on either side.\n\nThere is road access to one end of the aqueduct and to the foot of the aqueduct (the level where the Pahrali flows) on the opposite side. There is a huge flight of stairs, made more recently, that allows one to climb from the level of the Pahrali river to the trough.\n\nIrrigation water flows through the trough for a large part of the year, except in the summer (from February to May).\n\n==Tourist attraction==\n[[File:View from Mathur Bridge.JPG|thumb|right|View from the centre of the bridge]]\n[[File:Mathur Aqueduct with Western Ghats.jpg|thumb|Mathur Aqueduct with Western Ghats in background]]\nIn recent times, Mathoor Aqueduct has become a popular tourist attraction in Kanyakumari District.

Set in a universe in which [[Axis victory in World War II|Nazi Germany won World War II]], the story's lead protagonist is an officer of the [[Kripo]], the criminal police, who is investigating the murder of a Nazi government official who participated at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. A plot is thus discovered to eliminate all of those who attended conference to help the improvement of Germany's relations with the United States.\n\nThe novel inverts some of the conventions of the detective novel. It begins with a murder and diligent police detective investigating and eventually solving it. However, since the murderer is highly placed in a tyrannical regime, solving the mystery does not result in the detective pursuing and arresting the murderer. The contrary occurs in the novel: the murderer pursuing and arresting the detective.\n\nThe novel was an immediate best-seller in the UK and has sold over three million copies and been translated into 25 languages.<ref>{{Citation |last=[[Gavriel David Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]] |first=Gavriel David |title=The world Hitler never made |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-84706-0 |page=87 }}.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIt is April 1964 in [[Nazi Germany]], in the week leading up to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s{{refn|group=note|Hitler (as with the other \"real\" characters in the novel) is described factually up to 1942, after which the treatment is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}}}} 75th birthday. Detective Xavier March is an investigator working for the [[Kriminalpolizei (Nazi Germany)|Kriminalpolizei]] (''Kripo''), as he investigates the suspicious death of a high-ranking Nazi, [[Josef B\u00fchler]],{{refn|group=note|As with the other \"real\" characters in the novel, the biographical details up to 1942 are based on fact, after which the treatment is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}}}} in the [[Havel]] on the outskirts of [[Berlin]]. As March uncovers more details, he realises that he is caught up in a political scandal involving senior [[Nazi Party]] officials, who are apparently being systematically murdered under staged circumstances. As soon as the body is identified, the [[Gestapo]] claims jurisdiction and orders the Kripo to close its investigation.\n\nIn the story, March meets with Charlotte 'Charlie' Maguire, an American journalist also determined to investigate the case. They both travel to [[Z\u00fcrich]] to investigate the private [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank account of one of the murdered officials. Ultimately, the two uncover the truth behind the staged murders: [[Reinhard Heydrich]],{{refn|group=note|In reality, Heydrich was killed in 1942.}} the [[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS|head of the SS]], has ordered the Gestapo to eliminate the remaining officials who planned the [[the Holocaust|Final Solution]] (of which few Germans are aware) at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in January 1942. The elimination is being hurried to safeguard an upcoming meeting of Hitler and United States President [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] by ensuring that the fate of the missing Jews can never be revealed. Maguire heads for neutral [[Switzerland]], hoping to expose the evidence of the extermination to the world. March, however, is denounced by his ten-year-old son and apprehended by the Gestapo.\n\nIn the cellars of Gestapo headquarters at [[Niederkirchnerstra\u00dfe|Prinz-Albrecht-Stra\u00dfe]], March is tortured but does not reveal the location of Maguire. Globocnik boasts that [[Auschwitz]] and the other camps have been totally razed, and March will never know the truth for certain. Kripo Chief Arthur Nebe stages a rescue, intending to track March as he meets with Maguire at their rendezvous in [[Waldshut-Tiengen]] on the Swiss/German border. March realises what is happening and heads for [[Auschwitz]], leading the authorities in the wrong direction.\n\nThe Gestapo catches up with March at the unmarked site of Auschwitz. Knowing that Maguire has had the time to cross the border into Switzerland, March searches for some sign that the camp existed. As Gestapo agents close in on him in a helicopter, March uncovers bricks in the undergrowth. Satisfied, he pulls out his gun.\n\n==Characters==\n===Fictional===\n*Xavier March. A detective in the [[Kriminalpolizei]] with the concurrent honorary rank of [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] (Major) in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], March (nicknamed \"Zavi\" by his friends) is a 42-year-old divorc\u00e9 living in Berlin. He has one son, Pili (Paul), who lives with March's ex-wife, Klara. March's father died in 1929 from wounds sustained while he was serving in the [[Imperial German Navy]] during the [[Great War]], and his mother was killed in a [[Royal Air Force]] bombing raid in 1942. March commanded a [[U-Boat]] in World War II and was decorated for bravery and promoted. He married his nurse after the war, but the marriage steadily deteriorated afterward. His military service helped him rise through the police ranks to detective. By 1964, however, he is secretly under Gestapo surveillance since it correctly perceives him to have an intense dislike of the Nazi regime. For example, March refuses to donate to the '[[Winterhilfswerk|winter-relief]]', shows \"insufficient enthusiasm\" for his son's involvement in the [[Jungvolk]], has rebuffed all incentives to join the Nazi Party, tells \"jokes about the Party\" and, worst of all, has shown some curiosity about what happened to a Jewish family that used to live in his present apartment.\n*Charlotte \"Charlie\" Maguire. A 25-year-old American journalist, Maguire has been assigned to Berlin by the fictional [[news agency|news service]] ''World European Features''. Midway through the novel, she and March fall in love and begin a relationship. Maguire comes from a prominent [[Irish-American]] political family but is something of a renegade. The daughter of a US State Department official and German actress who left with him before the war, Maguire speaks fluent German without an accent.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=206\u2013207|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n*Hermann Jost. A 19-year-old cadet in an SS [[military academy]], Jost was out running when he discovered the corpse that triggered March's investigation. March is certain that Jost witnessed more than he is willing to disclose and at first believes him to be covering up a [[homosexual]] relationship with a fellow cadet, which is punishable by the [[death penalty]]. March, however, persuades Jost to admit the truth: Jost witnessed the dumping of the body and recognised SS General [[Odilo Globocnik]] at the scene. Midway through the novel, Globocnik smugly tells March, \"It's over. You have no witness\". March learns that Jost has been sent to a [[Strafbattalion|punishment battalion]] in occupied Russia that likely resulted in his death.\n*Paul \"Pili\" March. The ten-year-old son of March, Pili lives with his mother and her partner in a [[bungalow]] in the suburbs of Berlin. Pili is a fully-indoctrinated member of the ''[[Jungvolk]]'', the junior section of the [[Hitler Youth]] for boys between 10 and 14. Later in the novel, Pili denounces his father to the Gestapo, all the while unaware of what it will really do to him.\n*Max Jaeger. March's friend and Kripo partner, Jaeger is 50; lives with his wife, Hannelore, and four daughters in Berlin; and is disinclined to question 'the system'. At the end of the novel, he drives the getaway car that rescues March, but it is revealed that he had been informing against March since before the novel began and that March's \"rescue\" was arranged by the Gestapo as a ruse to find Maguire.\n*Walther Fiebes. A detective working in VB3, the Kripo's [[sexual crime]]s division, along the corridor from March's office, Fiebes is a man with a deeply prurient nature and relishes his work investigating sexual crimes, including rape, adultery and [[miscegenation|interracial relationships]] between \"Aryan\" women and their [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] servants.\n*Rudolf \"Rudi\" Halder. March's friend and a crewman on his U-boat, Rudi is now a historian working at the immense Reich Central Archives and helping to compile an official history of the [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Waffen-SS]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n*Karl Krebs. An officer in the Gestapo, Krebs is an example of the younger, university-trained SS-men hated by Globocnik.\n\n===Based on historical figures===\nHarris, in the ''Author's notes'' of the novel, explains that many characters are based on the real people with the same names and that the biographical details are indeed correct until 1942. Afterward, the narrative is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}} The following descriptions follow what is in the novel.\n*[[Odilo Globocnik]]. An aging [[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] in the Gestapo and right-hand man of Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Reinhard Heydrich, nicknamed \"Globus\". He is a principal antagonist of the book who is personally responsible for the assassinations of the Wannsee officials. After March's apprehension by the Gestapo, Globus takes over March's interrogation and administers several brutal beatings.\n*[[Arthur Nebe]]. The chief of the Kripo, Nebe is an old man in 1964 and has a sumptuous office in Berlin.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=138|ps=; Part 3, chapter 2}} Initially appearing to support March's investigation for political reasons, despite the Gestapo's involvement, Nebe eventually ascertains the threat posed to the Reich's international standing by March's investigations and weaves a ruse to March to make him reveal the whereabouts of the evidence.\n*[[Josef B\u00fchler]]. A secretary and deputy governor to the Nazi-controlled [[General Government]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]].\n*[[Wilhelm Stuckart]]. A [[Nazi Party]] lawyer, official and a state secretary in the German [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Interior Ministry]].\n*[[Martin Luther (diplomat)|Martin Luther]]. An advisor to Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]],\n*[[Reinhard Heydrich]]. The current head of the SS and is considered a likely successor to Hitler, Heydrich is a principal antagonist of the book although he never appears in person. He ordered the assassinations of the Wannsee officials to eradicate all first-hand evidence of the [[Final Solution]]. (In real life, he was assassinated on 4 June 1942 in Prague, but in the novel, the assassination failed.)\n\n====Others mentioned====\nIn each case, the description after the name describes how the characters appear in the novel, again by following reality until 1942.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}}\n*[[Adolf Hitler]].

Germany and its sphere of influence are in red; the United States and its sphere of influence in blue; China in yellow]]\nThroughout the novel, Harris gradually explains, in a fictional [[backstory]], the developments that allowed Germany to prevail in World War II. The author explains in the ''Author's notes'' that except for the backstories of the fictitious characters, the narrative describes reality up to 1942, after which it is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}} A significant early [[point of divergence]] is that Heydrich survived the assassination attempt by Czech fighters in May 1942 ([[Operation Anthropoid|he was killed in reality]]) and later became head of the SS. Another significant divergence is the political career of Kennedy, who was, in real life, disgraced in 1940 during the [[Battle of Britain]]. In the novel, for an unexplained reason, his political fortunes did not suffer or possibly recovered after the German victory, and he eventually became US President. The Nazi offensives on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] ultimately push back the Soviet forces, with the [[Case Blue]] operation succeeding in capturing the [[Caucasus]] and cutting the [[Red Army]] off from its petroleum reserves by 1943.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} The Nazis also found that the [[Enigma machine]] code had been broken. A massive [[U-Boat]] campaign against Britain then succeeded in starving the British into surrender by 1944.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}}\n\nIn the novel, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], the [[British royal family]] and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] fled into exile in [[Canada]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] regained the British throne soon afterwards, with [[Wallis Simpson]] as his queen.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=5|ps=; Part 1, chapter 1}}{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}}{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} The US defeated [[Imperial Japan|Japan]] in 1945 and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|used nuclear weapons]], as in real life.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} Germany tested its first [[atomic bomb]] in 1946 and fired a non-nuclear \"V-3\" missile above [[New York City]] to demonstrate its ability to attack the [[Continental United States]] with long-range missiles.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} Thus, after a peace treaty in 1946, the US and Germany are the novel's two superpower opponents in the [[Cold War]].{{refn|group=note|It is not explicitly stated in the novel whether Germany and the US are the only nuclear powers in the world.}}{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} There is a reference to a brutal regime having power in [[China]] but no reference to either its ideology or whether it is headed by [[Mao Zedong]] or somebody else. [[Tibet (1912-1951)|Tibet]] remains independent.\n\n===Alternate post-war history===\nThe fictional backstory describes that after it achieved victory, Germany reorganises Europe east of Poland into [[Reichskommissariat]]s. After the signing of the Treaty of Rome, [[Western Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]] are corralled into a pro-German trade bloc, the [[European Confederation|European Community]]. By 1964, the United States and the Greater German Reich are involved in a [[Cold War]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} The only exception is Switzerland, which retains its neutral status.\n\nThe [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] has died down into an endless guerrilla war in the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Siberia]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}} Mounting casualties (at least 100,000 since 1960, according to the novel{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}) have sapped the German military despite Hitler's statement, which is quoted in the novel, about a [[perpetual war]] to keep the [[German people]] on their toes. Dead German soldiers are returned to Germany in the middle of the night.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n\nThe action of the novel takes place from 14 to 20 April 1964, as Germany prepares for Hitler's 75th birthday celebrations on the latter date. A visit by US President Kennedy is planned as part of a gradual [[d\u00e9tente]] between the United States and the Germany. The novel suggests that the Nazi hierarchy is eager for peace since its efforts to settle the conquered East are failing because of continued resistance from [[Poland|Polish]] and Soviet partisan movements. Moreover, the Nazis failed to instil their ideology in the younger generation; many young German turn away from the regime though active opposition to the regime is limited.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=155|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}}\n\n[[The Holocaust]] has been explained away officially as merely the relocation of the [[Jews]] into areas of [[Eastern Europe]], where communications and transport networks are still very poor. However, many Germans suspect the government to have eliminated the Jews but are generally unconcerned or too afraid of the authorities to say or to do anything. Some surviving Jews have escaped to the [[Soviet Union]] and provided testimony of the extermination efforts there. Nazi authorities decry Bolshevik propaganda, but the outside world is aware of the Holocaust. The American president, however, remains neutral to avoid further damaging relations and refers only to vague \"human rights violations\" that he wishes to investigate when he visits Berlin.\n\nThe end suggests that the plans of both Kennedy and Hitler might be seriously derailed by the documents obtained by the protagonists and successfully smuggled out of Germany by Charlie. Their publication gives concrete hard evidence on the systematic murder of the Jews and might cause the cancellation of the Hitler\u2013Kennedy summit and sabotage the plans for a German\u2013American d\u00e9tente on which the Nazis were counting for economic recovery. The documents might also cause Kennedy to lose re-election in November 1964. The novel does not mention who the opposing candidate is and the policies that the candidate supports, but it might be a more anti-Nazi Cold Warrior.\n\n===Greater German Reich and international politics===\n[[File:Fatherland's 1964 Europe.jpg|350px|right|thumb|''Fatherland''{{'}}s 1964 Europe]]\nThe first few pages of the novel feature two maps: one of the city centre of Berlin and another of the extent of the massively-expanded Greater German Reich, which stretches from [[Alsace-Lorraine]] (\"Westmark\") in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] and lower [[Caucasus]] in the east.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|loc=Introduction}}\n\nThe Reich has retained [[Austria]] (now \"[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]\"), [[Slovenia]], the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and [[Luxembourg]] (now \"Moselland\"). In the East, Poland is still ruled as a colony by the [[General Government]], and Soviet territory west of the Urals has been divided into five Reichkommissariats: [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]] ([[Belarus]] and the [[Baltic states]]), [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]] with [[Odessa]], [[Reichskommissariat Moskau|Muscovy]] (from [[Moscow]] to the Urals), and [[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Caucasus]], along with ''Generalkommissariat Taurida'' (Southern Ukraine and the [[Crimea]]). There is also mention of a German naval base in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]], where the Reich's nuclear submarines are based.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}}\n\nBerlin has been remodelled as Hitler's \"[[Welthauptstadt Germania|capital of capitals]]\" and is designed according to the wishes of Hitler and his top architect, [[Albert Speer]],{{refn|group=note|Harris states the architectural description follows Speer's actual plans{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}}}} and is the world's largest city, with a population of ten million, where the virtually-powerless \"European Parliament\" is based.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=188|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}\n\nIn the novel, the rest of Western and [[Northern Europe]], excluding Switzerland and [[Vatican City]], has been corralled by Germany into a European Community, which is made up of [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The map provided shows [[Andorra]] was annexed by Spain and [[San Marino]] by Italy, and [[Liechtenstein]] was absorbed directly into Nazi Germany, similar to [[Anschluss|Austria]]. Eastern Europe is dominated by Germany and includes [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939\u20131943)|Albania]] and [[Government of National Salvation|Serbia]]. The European Community, despite having nominally-free nations under their own governments and leaders, are presumably only just able to police their own territory, and they are under constant watch by Berlin and are subordinate to Germany in all but name. The [[flag of Nazi Germany|German flag]] over the headquarters is twice as big as those of the other nations.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=188|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}\n\nThe Reich had turned its eyes to Switzerland and sought to absorb its German-speaking [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], but the stalemate of the Cold War settled in. Switzerland thus became a convenient neutral spot for diplomacy and for American and German intelligence agents to spy on each other and is the last state in Europe with a foreign policy that is independent of Berlin. \nIn the backstory, the United States is locked in a Cold War with Germany. Since the end of the war in 1946, both superpowers have developed nuclear and space technologies. Japan was defeated by the United States by the detonation of the atomic bomb. The United States is said to have not participated in the [[Olympic Games]] since 1936 but is expected to return in 1964. The novel refer to the [[League of Nations]] or to the possible existence of the [[United Nations]].\n\nA passing remark hints at [[China]] being ruled by a harsh government, but its precise nature and its leader ate not mentioned. A greatly-reduced Soviet [[rump state]], consisting of Siberia, the [[Russian Far East]] and [[Soviet Central Asia|Central Asia]], still exists, with its capital in [[Omsk]]. The US supplies weapons and funds, which allow the Russians to tie down German forces in the Urals. Although German propaganda plays down the war on the Eastern Front, the war there is taking its toll.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}{{refn|group=note|[[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] are not referred to in the novel.}}\n\nCanada, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are now allied with the United States, and all of [[Latin America]] (excluding the pro-Axis \"neutral\" [[Argentina]]) are pro-American satellites. [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] resides in Canada and is recognised by Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America and the United States as the rightful queen of the United Kingdom. [[Winston Churchill]] also lives in Canada.\n\nThe novel describes that since the end of the war, a stalemate has developed between Germany and the United States, which seems to overshadow international relations. New German buildings are constructed with mandatory [[bomb shelters]], and the ''Reichsarchiv'' (German National Archive) claims to have been built to withstand a direct missile hit.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=112|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=244|ps=; Part 4, chapter 3}}\n\n===Nazi society===\nIn the novel, Germany concentrates on the [[containment]] of the Soviet Union. Hitler has taken some steps to soften his image over the years and now usually wears civilian clothes, instead of the party uniform. Nonetheless, no substantive changes have taken place in the regime's basic character. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], the legal bases for Hitler's dictatorship, remain in effect. The press, the radio and the television are tightly controlled. Dissenters are still sent to [[List of German concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Conditions in the camps are reputed to be as harsh as they were in the 1930s and 1940s, but the [[International Red Cross]] is occasionally given staged inspections.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=324|ps=; Part 5, chapter 6}}\n\nIn the novel, the bedrock of Nazi ideology is still the policy of blaming subversive and minority groups for Germany's economic and social problems. Jews, [[communism|communists]], [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and [[miscegenation|interracial relationships]] (particularly between \"[[Aryan]]s\" and [[Slavic peoples|Slav]]s) continue to be scapegoats for the Nazis.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=17|ps=; Part 1, chapter 2}} Propaganda has previously depicted the United States to be corrupt, degenerate and poor. However, the bearing g diplomatic meeting between Hitler and Kennedy forces German propaganda is forced to change to a more positive image of the US.\n\nDespite its ideological and moral decline, Germany has a high standard of living, with its citizens living off the produce of their European satellite states and freed from physical labour by thousands of [[Polish people|Polish]], [[Czech people|Czech]] and [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] workers. The European nations export high-quality consumer goods to Germany (noted imports are domestic electronics from Britain) and also provide services, such as an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] academy at [[Oxford University]] and imported domestic staff. Hitler's personal tastes in [[Nazi art|art and music]] remain the norm for German society.\n\nMilitary service is still compulsory.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=?|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}} Eastern Europe has been colonised by German settlers although local [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] resistance movements are still active, and the German population has soared as a result of Nazi emphasis on childbirth. As the first generation of Nazi leaders, which founded the party and came to power alongside Hitler, begins to die off, Nazi officials are increasingly well-educated technocrats in the mould of [[Albert Speer]]. The police force (the ''[[Ordnungspolizei|Orpo]]'', or uniformed police, and the ''[[Kriminalpolizei|Kripo]]'', or criminal investigation bureau) is integrated with the SS, with police officers having honorary SS ranks.{{refn|group=note|The real-life integration occurred in 1936.}}\n\nAccording to the main characters, however, German society in the early 1960s is becoming more and more rebellious. The younger generation has no memory of the instability that paved the way for Hitler's rise to power. Student protests, particularly against the war in the Urals; American and British cultural influence and growing [[pacifism]] are all found in society. [[Jazz]] music is still popular, and the German government claims to have come up with a version which is free from \"[[Negro|Negroid]] influence\". In spite of the general repressiveness, [[the Beatles]]' real-life [[Hamburg]] engagements have happened here and already been denounced in the state-run press.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}} Germany is under constant attack by terrorist groups, with officials assassinated and civilian airliners bombed in-flight. [[Christianity]] is suppressed, and [[Hitler Youth|Nazi youth organisations]] are compulsory for all children. Universities are centres of student dissent, and the [[White Rose]] movement is once again active.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=155|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}}\n\nThe Nazis continue with their policies for women by encouraging them to remain in the home and to bring up many children (that emphasises the first two elements of ''[[Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche]]''), but women are clearly present in the Nazi bureaucracy. Nazi organisations such as ''[[Strength Through Joy|Kraft durch Freude]]'' still exist and fulfill their original roles such as providing holidays to resort areas under German control. German citizens are still encouraged to contribute to the [[Winterhilfswerk]]. A sprawling transport network covers the entire Reich, including a vast [[autobahn]] and railway network in the manner of the real-life proposed ''[[Breitspurbahn]]'' system, which carries immense trains.\n\n===Technology===\nThe level of technology in the novel's 1960s is much the same as in real life. The [[German military]] uses [[jet aircraft]], [[nuclear submarines]],{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}} and [[aircraft carriers]]; civilian technology has also advanced considerably. Jet airliners,{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=26|ps=; Part 1, chapter 3}} [[televisions]],{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=168|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}} [[hair-dryer|hair-dryers]], [[coffee machines]] and [[photocopiers]]{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=251\u2013252|ps=; Part 4, chapter 4}} are used in Germany.\n\nBoth the United States and Germany appear to have sophisticated space technology. Germany's space program is based at the old rocket-testing facility at [[Peenem\u00fcnde]], on the Baltic coast. The extent of space exploration is not specified, but a conversation between March and Maguire suggests that German is justified in boasting about being ahead of the US in the [[Space Race]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n\n==Critical evaluations==\nBritish scholar Nancy Browne noted the similarities between the ending of ''Fatherland'' and that of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'': \"Both novels end with the protagonist about to embark on a single-handed armed confrontation with a large number of Fascists or Nazis, of whose outcome there can be no doubt - but the reader does not witness the moment of his presumed death. (...) Like Hemingway's Robert Jordan, Xavier March is facing this last moment with an exhilaration born of having no further doubts and dilemmas, no more crucial decisions which need to be made, nothing but going through on his chosen course and dying in a just cause. And like Jordan, in sacrificing himself March is ensuring the safe escape of the woman he loves.<ref>\"Dr. Nancy Browne, \"In the perspective of a half a century after the event: Anti-Fascist and Anti-Nazi Resistance in English-language Popular Culture\" in Tamara Baxter (ed.) \"Multi-Disciplinary Round Table on the Lasting Heritage of the Twentieth Century\"</ref>\n\nThe review by ''[[The Guardian]]'', written by John Mullan, notes that Harris acknowledged a debt to Len Deighton's ''[[SS-GB]]'' (1978), an earlier postwar alternative or \"counter-factual\" history that was set in Great Britain in late 1941 after the (fictional) British surrender.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mullan |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/30/guardian-bookclub-fatherland-robert-harris |title=Fatherland by Robert Harris \u2013 Week one: speculative fiction |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref> Part 2 of the review states that Harris' \"invention of a nightmarish alternative history is... compelling\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Mullan |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/book-club-fatherland-robert-harris |title=Fatherland by Robert Harris \u2013 Week two: discoveries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==In other media{{anchor|Film, TV or theatrical adaptations}}==\n\n===Film===\n{{main|Fatherland (1994 film)}}\nA [[Fatherland (1994 film)|TV film of the book]] was made in 1994 by [[Home Box Office|HBO]], starring [[Rutger Hauer]] as March and [[Miranda Richardson]] as Maguire for which she received a [[Golden Globe Award]] in [[52nd Golden Globe Awards|1995]] for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV.

Set in a universe in which [[Axis victory in World War II|Nazi Germany won World War II]], the story's lead protagonist is an officer of the [[Kripo]], the criminal police, who is investigating the murder of a Nazi government official who participated at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. A plot is thus discovered to eliminate all of those who attended conference to help the improvement of Germany's relations with the United States.\n\nThe novel inverts some of the conventions of the detective novel. It begins with a murder and diligent police detective investigating and eventually solving it. However, since the murderer is highly placed in a tyrannical regime, solving the mystery does not result in the detective pursuing and arresting the murderer.

As March uncovers more details, he realises that he is caught up in a political scandal involving senior [[Nazi Party]] officials, who are apparently being systematically murdered under staged circumstances. As soon as the body is identified, the [[Gestapo]] claims jurisdiction and orders the Kripo to close its investigation.\n\nIn the story, March meets with Charlotte 'Charlie' Maguire, an American journalist also determined to investigate the case. They both travel to [[Z\u00fcrich]] to investigate the private [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank account of one of the murdered officials. Ultimately, the two uncover the truth behind the staged murders: [[Reinhard Heydrich]],{{refn|group=note|In reality, Heydrich was killed in 1942.}} the [[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS|head of the SS]], has ordered the Gestapo to eliminate the remaining officials who planned the [[the Holocaust|Final Solution]] (of which few Germans are aware) at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in January 1942. The elimination is being hurried to safeguard an upcoming meeting of Hitler and United States President [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] by ensuring that the fate of the missing Jews can never be revealed. Maguire heads for neutral [[Switzerland]], hoping to expose the evidence of the extermination to the world. March, however, is denounced by his ten-year-old son and apprehended by the Gestapo.\n\nIn the cellars of Gestapo headquarters at [[Niederkirchnerstra\u00dfe|Prinz-Albrecht-Stra\u00dfe]], March is tortured but does not reveal the location of Maguire. Globocnik boasts that [[Auschwitz]] and the other camps have been totally razed, and March will never know the truth for certain. Kripo Chief Arthur Nebe stages a rescue, intending to track March as he meets with Maguire at their rendezvous in [[Waldshut-Tiengen]] on the Swiss/German border. March realises what is happening and heads for [[Auschwitz]], leading the authorities in the wrong direction.\n\nThe Gestapo catches up with March at the unmarked site of Auschwitz. Knowing that Maguire has had the time to cross the border into Switzerland, March searches for some sign that the camp existed. As Gestapo agents close in on him in a helicopter, March uncovers bricks in the undergrowth. Satisfied, he pulls out his gun.\n\n==Characters==\n===Fictional===\n*Xavier March. A detective in the [[Kriminalpolizei]] with the concurrent honorary rank of [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] (Major) in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], March (nicknamed \"Zavi\" by his friends) is a 42-year-old divorc\u00e9 living in Berlin. He has one son, Pili (Paul), who lives with March's ex-wife, Klara. March's father died in 1929 from wounds sustained while he was serving in the [[Imperial German Navy]] during the [[Great War]], and his mother was killed in a [[Royal Air Force]] bombing raid in 1942. March commanded a [[U-Boat]] in World War II and was decorated for bravery and promoted. He married his nurse after the war, but the marriage steadily deteriorated afterward. His military service helped him rise through the police ranks to detective. By 1964, however, he is secretly under Gestapo surveillance since it correctly perceives him to have an intense dislike of the Nazi regime. For example, March refuses to donate to the '[[Winterhilfswerk|winter-relief]]', shows \"insufficient enthusiasm\" for his son's involvement in the [[Jungvolk]], has rebuffed all incentives to join the Nazi Party, tells \"jokes about the Party\" and, worst of all, has shown some curiosity about what happened to a Jewish family that used to live in his present apartment.\n*Charlotte \"Charlie\" Maguire. A 25-year-old American journalist, Maguire has been assigned to Berlin by the fictional [[news agency|news service]] ''World European Features''. Midway through the novel, she and March fall in love and begin a relationship. Maguire comes from a prominent [[Irish-American]] political family but is something of a renegade. The daughter of a US State Department official and German actress who left with him before the war, Maguire speaks fluent German without an accent.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=206\u2013207|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n*Hermann Jost. A 19-year-old cadet in an SS [[military academy]], Jost was out running when he discovered the corpse that triggered March's investigation. March is certain that Jost witnessed more than he is willing to disclose and at first believes him to be covering up a [[homosexual]] relationship with a fellow cadet, which is punishable by the [[death penalty]]. March, however, persuades Jost to admit the truth: Jost witnessed the dumping of the body and recognised SS General [[Odilo Globocnik]] at the scene. Midway through the novel, Globocnik smugly tells March, \"It's over. You have no witness\". March learns that Jost has been sent to a [[Strafbattalion|punishment battalion]] in occupied Russia that likely resulted in his death.\n*Paul \"Pili\" March. The ten-year-old son of March, Pili lives with his mother and her partner in a [[bungalow]] in the suburbs of Berlin. Pili is a fully-indoctrinated member of the ''[[Jungvolk]]'', the junior section of the [[Hitler Youth]] for boys between 10 and 14. Later in the novel, Pili denounces his father to the Gestapo, all the while unaware of what it will really do to him.\n*Max Jaeger. March's friend and Kripo partner, Jaeger is 50; lives with his wife, Hannelore, and four daughters in Berlin; and is disinclined to question 'the system'. At the end of the novel, he drives the getaway car that rescues March, but it is revealed that he had been informing against March since before the novel began and that March's \"rescue\" was arranged by the Gestapo as a ruse to find Maguire.\n*Walther Fiebes. A detective working in VB3, the Kripo's [[sexual crime]]s division, along the corridor from March's office, Fiebes is a man with a deeply prurient nature and relishes his work investigating sexual crimes, including rape, adultery and [[miscegenation|interracial relationships]] between \"Aryan\" women and their [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] servants.\n*Rudolf \"Rudi\" Halder. March's friend and a crewman on his U-boat, Rudi is now a historian working at the immense Reich Central Archives and helping to compile an official history of the [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Waffen-SS]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n*Karl Krebs. An officer in the Gestapo, Krebs is an example of the younger, university-trained SS-men hated by Globocnik.\n\n===Based on historical figures===\nHarris, in the ''Author's notes'' of the novel, explains that many characters are based on the real people with the same names and that the biographical details are indeed correct until 1942. Afterward, the narrative is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}} The following descriptions follow what is in the novel.\n*[[Odilo Globocnik]].

Germany and its sphere of influence are in red; the United States and its sphere of influence in blue; China in yellow]]\nThroughout the novel, Harris gradually explains, in a fictional [[backstory]], the developments that allowed Germany to prevail in World War II. The author explains in the ''Author's notes'' that except for the backstories of the fictitious characters, the narrative describes reality up to 1942, after which it is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}} A significant early [[point of divergence]] is that Heydrich survived the assassination attempt by Czech fighters in May 1942 ([[Operation Anthropoid|he was killed in reality]]) and later became head of the SS. Another significant divergence is the political career of Kennedy, who was, in real life, disgraced in 1940 during the [[Battle of Britain]]. In the novel, for an unexplained reason, his political fortunes did not suffer or possibly recovered after the German victory, and he eventually became US President. The Nazi offensives on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] ultimately push back the Soviet forces, with the [[Case Blue]] operation succeeding in capturing the [[Caucasus]] and cutting the [[Red Army]] off from its petroleum reserves by 1943.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} The Nazis also found that the [[Enigma machine]] code had been broken.

[[Tibet (1912-1951)|Tibet]] remains independent.\n\n===Alternate post-war history===\nThe fictional backstory describes that after it achieved victory, Germany reorganises Europe east of Poland into [[Reichskommissariat]]s. After the signing of the Treaty of Rome, [[Western Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]] are corralled into a pro-German trade bloc, the [[European Confederation|European Community]]. By 1964, the United States and the Greater German Reich are involved in a [[Cold War]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} The only exception is Switzerland, which retains its neutral status.\n\nThe [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] has died down into an endless guerrilla war in the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Siberia]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}} Mounting casualties (at least 100,000 since 1960, according to the novel{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}) have sapped the German military despite Hitler's statement, which is quoted in the novel, about a [[perpetual war]] to keep the [[German people]] on their toes. Dead German soldiers are returned to Germany in the middle of the night.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n\nThe action of the novel takes place from 14 to 20 April 1964, as Germany prepares for Hitler's 75th birthday celebrations on the latter date. A visit by US President Kennedy is planned as part of a gradual [[d\u00e9tente]] between the United States and the Germany. The novel suggests that the Nazi hierarchy is eager for peace since its efforts to settle the conquered East are failing because of continued resistance from [[Poland|Polish]] and Soviet partisan movements. Moreover, the Nazis failed to instil their ideology in the younger generation; many young German turn away from the regime though active opposition to the regime is limited.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=155|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}}\n\n[[The Holocaust]] has been explained away officially as merely the relocation of the [[Jews]] into areas of [[Eastern Europe]], where communications and transport networks are still very poor. However, many Germans suspect the government to have eliminated the Jews but are generally unconcerned or too afraid of the authorities to say or to do anything. Some surviving Jews have escaped to the [[Soviet Union]] and provided testimony of the extermination efforts there. Nazi authorities decry Bolshevik propaganda, but the outside world is aware of the Holocaust. The American president, however, remains neutral to avoid further damaging relations and refers only to vague \"human rights violations\" that he wishes to investigate when he visits Berlin.\n\nThe end suggests that the plans of both Kennedy and Hitler might be seriously derailed by the documents obtained by the protagonists and successfully smuggled out of Germany by Charlie. Their publication gives concrete hard evidence on the systematic murder of the Jews and might cause the cancellation of the Hitler\u2013Kennedy summit and sabotage the plans for a German\u2013American d\u00e9tente on which the Nazis were counting for economic recovery. The documents might also cause Kennedy to lose re-election in November 1964. The novel does not mention who the opposing candidate is and the policies that the candidate supports, but it might be a more anti-Nazi Cold Warrior.\n\n===Greater German Reich and international politics===\n[[File:Fatherland's 1964 Europe.jpg|350px|right|thumb|''Fatherland''{{'}}s 1964 Europe]]\nThe first few pages of the novel feature two maps: one of the city centre of Berlin and another of the extent of the massively-expanded Greater German Reich, which stretches from [[Alsace-Lorraine]] (\"Westmark\") in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] and lower [[Caucasus]] in the east.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|loc=Introduction}}\n\nThe Reich has retained [[Austria]] (now \"[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]\"), [[Slovenia]], the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and [[Luxembourg]] (now \"Moselland\"). In the East, Poland is still ruled as a colony by the [[General Government]], and Soviet territory west of the Urals has been divided into five Reichkommissariats: [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]] ([[Belarus]] and the [[Baltic states]]), [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]] with [[Odessa]], [[Reichskommissariat Moskau|Muscovy]] (from [[Moscow]] to the Urals), and [[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Caucasus]], along with ''Generalkommissariat Taurida'' (Southern Ukraine and the [[Crimea]]). There is also mention of a German naval base in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]], where the Reich's nuclear submarines are based.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}}\n\nBerlin has been remodelled as Hitler's \"[[Welthauptstadt Germania|capital of capitals]]\" and is designed according to the wishes of Hitler and his top architect, [[Albert Speer]],{{refn|group=note|Harris states the architectural description follows Speer's actual plans{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}}}} and is the world's largest city, with a population of ten million, where the virtually-powerless \"European Parliament\" is based.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=188|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}\n\nIn the novel, the rest of Western and [[Northern Europe]], excluding Switzerland and [[Vatican City]], has been corralled by Germany into a European Community, which is made up of [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The map provided shows [[Andorra]] was annexed by Spain and [[San Marino]] by Italy, and [[Liechtenstein]] was absorbed directly into Nazi Germany, similar to [[Anschluss|Austria]]. Eastern Europe is dominated by Germany and includes [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939\u20131943)|Albania]] and [[Government of National Salvation|Serbia]]. The European Community, despite having nominally-free nations under their own governments and leaders, are presumably only just able to police their own territory, and they are under constant watch by Berlin and are subordinate to Germany in all but name. The [[flag of Nazi Germany|German flag]] over the headquarters is twice as big as those of the other nations.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=188|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}\n\nThe Reich had turned its eyes to Switzerland and sought to absorb its German-speaking [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], but the stalemate of the Cold War settled in. Switzerland thus became a convenient neutral spot for diplomacy and for American and German intelligence agents to spy on each other and is the last state in Europe with a foreign policy that is independent of Berlin. \nIn the backstory, the United States is locked in a Cold War with Germany. Since the end of the war in 1946, both superpowers have developed nuclear and space technologies. Japan was defeated by the United States by the detonation of the atomic bomb. The United States is said to have not participated in the [[Olympic Games]] since 1936 but is expected to return in 1964. The novel refer to the [[League of Nations]] or to the possible existence of the [[United Nations]].\n\nA passing remark hints at [[China]] being ruled by a harsh government, but its precise nature and its leader ate not mentioned. A greatly-reduced Soviet [[rump state]], consisting of Siberia, the [[Russian Far East]] and [[Soviet Central Asia|Central Asia]], still exists, with its capital in [[Omsk]]. The US supplies weapons and funds, which allow the Russians to tie down German forces in the Urals. Although German propaganda plays down the war on the Eastern Front, the war there is taking its toll.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}{{refn|group=note|[[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] are not referred to in the novel.}}\n\nCanada, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are now allied with the United States, and all of [[Latin America]] (excluding the pro-Axis \"neutral\" [[Argentina]]) are pro-American satellites. [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] resides in Canada and is recognised by Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America and the United States as the rightful queen of the United Kingdom. [[Winston Churchill]] also lives in Canada.\n\nThe novel describes that since the end of the war, a stalemate has developed between Germany and the United States, which seems to overshadow international relations. New German buildings are constructed with mandatory [[bomb shelters]], and the ''Reichsarchiv'' (German National Archive) claims to have been built to withstand a direct missile hit.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=112|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=244|ps=; Part 4, chapter 3}}\n\n===Nazi society===\nIn the novel, Germany concentrates on the [[containment]] of the Soviet Union. Hitler has taken some steps to soften his image over the years and now usually wears civilian clothes, instead of the party uniform. Nonetheless, no substantive changes have taken place in the regime's basic character. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], the legal bases for Hitler's dictatorship, remain in effect. The press, the radio and the television are tightly controlled. Dissenters are still sent to [[List of German concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Conditions in the camps are reputed to be as harsh as they were in the 1930s and 1940s, but the [[International Red Cross]] is occasionally given staged inspections.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=324|ps=; Part 5, chapter 6}}\n\nIn the novel, the bedrock of Nazi ideology is still the policy of blaming subversive and minority groups for Germany's economic and social problems. Jews, [[communism|communists]], [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and [[miscegenation|interracial relationships]] (particularly between \"[[Aryan]]s\" and [[Slavic peoples|Slav]]s) continue to be scapegoats for the Nazis.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=17|ps=; Part 1, chapter 2}} Propaganda has previously depicted the United States to be corrupt, degenerate and poor. However, the bearing g diplomatic meeting between Hitler and Kennedy forces German propaganda is forced to change to a more positive image of the US.\n\nDespite its ideological and moral decline, Germany has a high standard of living, with its citizens living off the produce of their European satellite states and freed from physical labour by thousands of [[Polish people|Polish]], [[Czech people|Czech]] and [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] workers. The European nations export high-quality consumer goods to Germany (noted imports are domestic electronics from Britain) and also provide services, such as an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] academy at [[Oxford University]] and imported domestic staff. Hitler's personal tastes in [[Nazi art|art and music]] remain the norm for German society.\n\nMilitary service is still compulsory.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=?|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}} Eastern Europe has been colonised by German settlers although local [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] resistance movements are still active, and the German population has soared as a result of Nazi emphasis on childbirth. As the first generation of Nazi leaders, which founded the party and came to power alongside Hitler, begins to die off, Nazi officials are increasingly well-educated technocrats in the mould of [[Albert Speer]]. The police force (the ''[[Ordnungspolizei|Orpo]]'', or uniformed police, and the ''[[Kriminalpolizei|Kripo]]'', or criminal investigation bureau) is integrated with the SS, with police officers having honorary SS ranks.{{refn|group=note|The real-life integration occurred in 1936.}}\n\nAccording to the main characters, however, German society in the early 1960s is becoming more and more rebellious. The younger generation has no memory of the instability that paved the way for Hitler's rise to power. Student protests, particularly against the war in the Urals; American and British cultural influence and growing [[pacifism]] are all found in society. [[Jazz]] music is still popular, and the German government claims to have come up with a version which is free from \"[[Negro|Negroid]] influence\". In spite of the general repressiveness, [[the Beatles]]' real-life [[Hamburg]] engagements have happened here and already been denounced in the state-run press.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}} Germany is under constant attack by terrorist groups, with officials assassinated and civilian airliners bombed in-flight. [[Christianity]] is suppressed, and [[Hitler Youth|Nazi youth organisations]] are compulsory for all children. Universities are centres of student dissent, and the [[White Rose]] movement is once again active.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=155|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}}\n\nThe Nazis continue with their policies for women by encouraging them to remain in the home and to bring up many children (that emphasises the first two elements of ''[[Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche]]''), but women are clearly present in the Nazi bureaucracy. Nazi organisations such as ''[[Strength Through Joy|Kraft durch Freude]]'' still exist and fulfill their original roles such as providing holidays to resort areas under German control. German citizens are still encouraged to contribute to the [[Winterhilfswerk]]. A sprawling transport network covers the entire Reich, including a vast [[autobahn]] and railway network in the manner of the real-life proposed ''[[Breitspurbahn]]'' system, which carries immense trains.\n\n===Technology===\nThe level of technology in the novel's 1960s is much the same as in real life. The [[German military]] uses [[jet aircraft]], [[nuclear submarines]],{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}} and [[aircraft carriers]]; civilian technology has also advanced considerably. Jet airliners,{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=26|ps=; Part 1, chapter 3}} [[televisions]],{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=168|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}} [[hair-dryer|hair-dryers]], [[coffee machines]] and [[photocopiers]]{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=251\u2013252|ps=; Part 4, chapter 4}} are used in Germany.\n\nBoth the United States and Germany appear to have sophisticated space technology. Germany's space program is based at the old rocket-testing facility at [[Peenem\u00fcnde]], on the Baltic coast. The extent of space exploration is not specified, but a conversation between March and Maguire suggests that German is justified in boasting about being ahead of the US in the [[Space Race]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n\n==Critical evaluations==\nBritish scholar Nancy Browne noted the similarities between the ending of ''Fatherland'' and that of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'': \"Both novels end with the protagonist about to embark on a single-handed armed confrontation with a large number of Fascists or Nazis, of whose outcome there can be no doubt - but the reader does not witness the moment of his presumed death. (...) Like Hemingway's Robert Jordan, Xavier March is facing this last moment with an exhilaration born of having no further doubts and dilemmas, no more crucial decisions which need to be made, nothing but going through on his chosen course and dying in a just cause. And like Jordan, in sacrificing himself March is ensuring the safe escape of the woman he loves.<ref>\"Dr. Nancy Browne, \"In the perspective of a half a century after the event: Anti-Fascist and Anti-Nazi Resistance in English-language Popular Culture\" in Tamara Baxter (ed.) \"Multi-Disciplinary Round Table on the Lasting Heritage of the Twentieth Century\"</ref>\n\nThe review by ''[[The Guardian]]'', written by John Mullan, notes that Harris acknowledged a debt to Len Deighton's ''[[SS-GB]]'' (1978), an earlier postwar alternative or \"counter-factual\" history that was set in Great Britain in late 1941 after the (fictional) British surrender.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mullan |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/30/guardian-bookclub-fatherland-robert-harris |title=Fatherland by Robert Harris \u2013 Week one: speculative fiction |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref> Part 2 of the review states that Harris' \"invention of a nightmarish alternative history is... compelling\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Mullan |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/book-club-fatherland-robert-harris |title=Fatherland by Robert Harris \u2013 Week two: discoveries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==In other media{{anchor|Film, TV or theatrical adaptations}}==\n\n===Film===\n{{main|Fatherland (1994 film)}}\nA [[Fatherland (1994 film)|TV film of the book]] was made in 1994 by [[Home Box Office|HBO]], starring [[Rutger Hauer]] as March and [[Miranda Richardson]] as Maguire for which she received a [[Golden Globe Award]] in [[52nd Golden Globe Awards|1995]] for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV.

Foreign consulates resumed their activities on Formosa, 2 including Russian activities in 1896. The first Russian consul was the German native [[Paul Shabert]]. Both the Republic of China and the Soviet Union were the founding members of the [[United Nations]] and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] in 1945.\n\nAfter the end of the [[Korean War]] in 1954, the US signed a security treaty with the government of the Republic of China, which included a clause providing for American participation in military action in case of confrontation with mainland China. The Soviet Union minister of foreign affairs in a statement called the treaty a \u201crude violation of international agreements, sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of the PRC.\u201d{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAll contact between the USSR and the Republic of China defined by the [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance]] of 1945 was broken off. The announcement of the breakup was made on October 3, 1949 after the Soviet Union became the first country to recognize the PRC in October.\n\nAlthough there have been some weak tendencies towards change in the status quo since the late 1950s, up to this day, the Russian Federation has had no official relations with Taiwan. It is worth mentioning that the USSR had always adhered to the policy of \u201cone China\u201d but insisted on a political solution to deal with the crisis, unlike some Beijing leaders who were considering military action in 1954 and 1958. Possibly, it was one of the reasons for the cooling of Sino Soviet relations at the end of the 1950s. When in September 1954 bombardment of the Taiwan-adjacent islands provoked the first of the three Matszu-Amoi crises, the Soviet Union in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]\u2019s statement officially announced its support of the PRC. At the same time, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Foreign Minister]] [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] expressed concern that the regional conflict would turn into a major war, while accusing the United States of provoking the conflict. Not long before the crisis in 1954, Taiwan\u2019s coast guard captured Soviet oil tanker \u201cTuapse,\u201d which was on course from [[Odessa]] to [[Vladivostok]]. Forty-nine crew members were arrested, four of whom later managed to escape and returned home. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union called for the Ten Nations Summit in New Delhi to discuss the issue on 27 September 1958 as one of the precursors of the later Sino-Soviet split.\n\nUnofficial contact between the USSR and Taiwan started at the end of the 1960s, after the tendency toward a US-PRC rapprochement had become obvious. It is well known that the visits by [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] resulted in the signing of the so-called [[Shanghai communiqu\u00e9]] in 1972 when it was declared that the US \u201cacknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China.\u201d Meanwhile, Taiwan hoped that a Soviet-Taiwanese rapprochement would prevent the rising number of Sino-American contacts. It is possible that the USSR in its turn considered that restoration of relations with the ROC would help to slow down the aggravation in Soviet-PRC relations. Taiwan was eager to compromise since after the weakening of its relations with the US, it had little to lose. The Soviet Union, however, was very careful in its policy towards the ROC, trading with it via [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]], [[West Germany]], and its [[East Europe]]an allies.\n\n==Present day relations==\nThe ROC representative office in Russia, the ''Representative Office in Moscow for the Taipei-Moscow Economic and Cultural Coordination Commission'', was opened on 12 July 1993 by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Republic of China)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] of the ROC. The Russian representative office in Taiwan, ''Representative Office in Taipei for the Moscow-Taipei Coordination Commission on Economic and Cultural Cooperation'', was opened on 15 December 1996 by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] of Russia.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oqF8AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=Representative+Office+in+Moscow+for+the+Taipei+opened+in&source=bl&ots=eC5nnnr3OT&sig=AMdH2v1ggsKFgiuDcc5k1inDvyo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6VwcVL3UNoSiugT71oD4Ag&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Representative%20Office%20in%20Moscow%20for%20the%20Taipei%20opened%20in&f=false| author=Czeslaw Tubilewicz|title=Taiwan and Post-Communist Europe|page=99|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2007|isbn=0-203-94697-9}}</ref>\n\nBy 2002, the borders of Outer Mongolia were eliminated from the ROC boundary definition in which the [[Tuva Republic]] was incorporated in. \n\nIn 2005, the total amount of the trade between the two countries (in US dollars) was 2,188,944,473. As can be seen from the data, Russia keeps a positive balance in its trade relations with Taiwan thanks to crude oil, cast iron and steel, nonferrous metals, petrochemical products, ferro-alloys, coking coal, timber, and chemical fertilizers. Russia imports mostly electronics and electronic parts, computers and computer parts, and home appliances.{{fact|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe negative trade balance ($1.68 billion in 2005) issue is taken seriously in Taiwan. However, the prevalence of natural resources in Russian exports and industrial products in Taiwan are considered in Taiwan to be logical at the present stage of relations. To improve the situation, it is recommended to increase the export of Taiwanese products to Russia. The relatively low level of Taiwanese exports to Russia can be explained by several factors. Firstly, the price of Taiwanese products is still quite high for most Russian consumers, the rest prefer high-end European, American, or Japanese products. Secondly, there are difficulties and complexities involved in bank transfers, which are mostly conducted through third countries. Thirdly, there is insufficient guarantee from the government for foreign investors. As a result, foreign business, including the Taiwanese, prefers to invest in more stable and predictable regions. It is also worth mentioning that Russia imports many products from the PRC, some of which are in fact made at Taiwanese-owned operations. However, this trade is officially considered in the statistics as part of the Russian-PRC trade.{{fact|date=December 2018}}\n\nOver the past years, Russia has welcomed more than 300 Taiwanese students to work in the country, while Taiwan has allowed 200 Russian students.<ref name=\"taipeitimes.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/06/16/2003446300|title=COMMUNITY COMPASS: Russian-Taiwanese ties celebrated at Russian National Day party| work=[[Taipei Times]]| date=16 June 2009|page=4}}</ref> It is also said that around 1,000 Taiwanese visit Russia each year.<ref name=\"taipeitimes.com\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Taiwan|Russia}}\n*[[Foreign relations of Russia]]\n*[[Foreign relations of Taiwan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Hu, S. \"Assessing Russia's Role in Cross-Taiwan Strait Relations,\" ''Issues & Studies'', Vol. 43, No. 4 (December 2007): pp.&nbsp;39\u201376.\n*Share, M.: ''Where Empires Collided: Russian and Soviet Relations with Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau'' (Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press, 2007).\n\n==External links==\n*[http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no16_2_ses/10_vradiy.pdf Russia\u2019s Unofficial Relations with Taiwan]\n*[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/06/16/2003446300 Taipei Times - COMMUNITY COMPASS: Russian-Taiwanese ties celebrated at Russian National Day party]\n\n{{Foreign relations of Russia|Asia}}\n{{Foreign relations of Taiwan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Russia-Taiwan relations}}\n[[Category:Russia\u2013Taiwan relations| ]]\n[[Category:Bilateral relations of Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Bilateral relations of Russia|Taiwan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|1=Diplomatic relations between Russia and Taiwan}}\n{{Infobox bilateral relations|Taiwanese-Russian|Taiwan|Russia|map=ROC Russia Locator.png}}\n\nBilateral relations between the '''[[Russia|Russian Federation]]''''s predecessor the '''[[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]''' and the '''[[Taiwan|Republic of China]]''' were established from 1922 until 1949 when it switched to the recognition of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (and in the same year the ROC established diplomatic relations with [[South Korea]]).\n\n==Past relations==\n{{Main|China\u2013Russia relations#1755-1917|Sino-Soviet relations|China\u2013Russia relations#Soviet Union, Taiwan, People's Republic of China}}\n\nAs a result of the [[Shimonoseki Treaty]] in 1895, which ended the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], Taiwan was transferred to Japan and was promptly made a Japanese colony.
