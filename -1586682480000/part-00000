First published in 1964 by Harper & Row, it has become one of Silverstein\u2019s best-known titles, and has been translated into numerous languages.\n\nThis book has been described as \"one of the most divisive books in children's literature\"; the controversy stems from whether the [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] between the main characters (a boy and the titular tree) should be interpreted as positive (i.e., the tree gives the boy [[Altruism|selfless love]]) or negative (i.e., the boy and the tree have an [[abusive relationship]]).\n\n==Background==\nSilverstein had difficulty finding a publisher for ''The Giving Tree''.<ref name=NYT1973>{{cite news |title=About Alice, a Rabbit, a Tree... |author= Cole, William |newspaper=The New York Times |page=394|date=September 9, 1973}}</ref><ref name=NYT2011>{{cite news |title=The Children\u2019s Authors Who Broke the Rules |author= Paul, Pamela|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/books/review/the-childrens-authors-who-broke-the-rules.html|newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref> An editor at [[Simon & Schuster]] rejected the book's manuscript because he felt that it was \"too sad\" for children and \"too simple\" for adults.<ref name=NYT1973/><ref name=NYT2011/> [[Tomi Ungerer]] encouraged Silverstein to approach [[Ursula Nordstrom]], who was a publisher with Harper & Row.<ref name=NYT1973/>\n\nAn editor with Harper & Row stated that Silverstein had made the original illustrations \"scratchy\" like his cartoons for ''[[Playboy]]'', but that he later reworked the art in a \"more pared-down and much sweeter style.\"<ref name=HornBook1999/> The final black-and-white drawings have been described as \"unadorned\u2026 visual minimalism.\"<ref name=Spitz1999>{{cite book | last = Spitz | first = Ellen Handler | title = Inside Picture Books | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, CT | year = 1999 | isbn = 0300076029 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/insidepictureboo00spit_0/page/142 142\u2013144] | url = https://archive.org/details/insidepictureboo00spit_0/page/142 }}</ref> Harper & Row published a small first edition of the book, consisting of only 5,000\u20137,500 copies, in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Natov, Roni |author2=Geraldine DeLuca  |lastauthoramp=yes |year= 1979 |title= Discovering Contemporary Classics: an Interview with Ursula Nordstrom|journal= [[The Lion and the Unicorn (journal)|The Lion and the Unicorn]] |volume= 3 |issue= 1 |pages =119\u2013135 |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/uni/summary/v003/3.1.natov01.html|access-date=May 18, 2013|doi= 10.1353/uni.0.0355 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe book follows the lives of a female apple tree and a boy, who develop a relationship with one another.  The tree is very \"giving\" and the boy evolves into a \"taking\" teenager, man, then elderly man.  Despite the fact that the boy ages in the story, the tree addresses the boy as \"Boy\" his entire life.\n\nIn his childhood, the boy enjoys playing with the tree, climbing her trunk, swinging from her branches, carving \"Me + T (Tree)\" into the bark, and eating her apples. However, as the boy grows older, he spends less time with the tree and tends to visit her only when he wants material items at various stages of his life, or not coming to the tree alone (such as bringing a lady friend to the tree and carving \"Me +Y.L.\" (her initials, often assumed to be an acronym for \"young love\") into the tree. In an effort to make the boy happy at each of these stages, the tree gives him parts of herself, which he can transform into material items, such as money (from her apples), a house (from her branches), and a boat (from her trunk).  With every stage of giving, \"the Tree was happy\".\n\nIn the final pages, both the tree and the boy feel the sting of their respective \"giving\" and \"taking\" nature.  When only a stump remains for the tree (including the carving \"Me + T\"), she is not happy, at least at that moment.  The boy does return as a tired elderly man to meet the tree once more. She tells him she is sad because she cannot provide him shade, apples, or any materials like in the past. He ignores this (because his teeth are too weak for apples, and he is too old to swing on branches and too tired to climb her trunk) and states that all he wants is \"a quiet place to sit and rest,\" which the tree, who is weak being just a stump, could provide.  With this final stage of giving, \"the Tree was happy\".\n\n==Reception==\nInterest in the book increased by [[word of mouth]]; for example, in churches \"it was hailed as a parable on the joys of giving.\"<ref name=NYT1973/>  As of 2001, over 5 million copies of the book had been sold, placing it 14th on a list of hardcover \"All-Time Bestselling Children's Books\" from ''[[Publishers Weekly]].''<ref>{{cite journal |author= Roback, Diane, Jason Britton, and Debbie Hochman Turvey |date= December 17, 2001 |title= All-Time Bestselling Children's Books |journal= Publishers Weekly |volume= 248 |issue= 51 |url= http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20011217/28595-all-time-bestselling-children-s-books.html|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>  By 2011, 8.5 million copies of the book had been sold.<ref name=NYT2011/>\n\nIn a 1999\u20132000 [[National Education Association]] online survey of children, among the \"Kids' Top 100 Books,\" the book was 24th.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13110.htm |title= Kids' Top 100 Books |author= National Education Association |accessdate= May 18, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130201190330/http://www.nea.org/grants/13110.htm |archivedate= February 1, 2013 }}</ref>  Based on a 2007 online \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\" poll by the National Education Association, the book came in third.<ref name=NEA2007>{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref> It was 85th of the \"Top 100 Picture Books\" of all time in a 2012 poll by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.<ref name=SLJPicture2012>{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/06/top-100-picture-books-poll-results/ |title= Top 100 Picture Books Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth | publisher=[[School Library Journal]] \"A Fuse #8 Production\" blog|date= May 18, 2013|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Scholastic Parent & Child]]'' magazine placed it #9 on its list of \"100 Greatest Books for Kids\" in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scholastic.com/100books/pdf/Top_100_Childrens_Books_of_All_Time.pdf|title=Parent & Child 100 Greatest Books for Kids |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2012 |publisher= [[Scholastic Corporation]]|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>  As of 2013, it ranked third on a [[Goodreads]] list of \"Best Children's Books.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.goodreads.com/list/show/86.Best_Children_s_Books|title=Best Children's Books |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2008 |publisher= [[Goodreads]]|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Interpretations ==\n{{weasel words|section|date=April 2015}}\nThere are numerous interpretations of the book, including:<ref name=Samuelsson1998>{{cite journal|last1=Pramling Samuelsson|first1=Ingrid |last2=Mauritzson|first2=Ulla|last3=Asplund Carlsson|first3=Maj|last4=Ueda|first4=Miyoko|title=A Mother and a Friend: Differences in Japanese and Swedish Mothers' Understanding of a Tale|journal=Childhood|volume=5|issue=4|year=1998|pages=493\u2013506|issn=0907-5682|doi=10.1177/0907568298005004008}}</ref><ref name=Fraustino2008>{{cite book |last1=Fraustino |first1=Lisa Rowe |chapter=At the Core of The Giving Tree\u2019s Signifying Apples |pages=284\u2013306  | editor1-first=Annette M.  |editor1-last=Magid | title = You Are What You Eat: Literary Probes into the Palate | publisher = Cambridge Scholars | location = Newcastle, UK | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781847184924 }}</ref>\n\n===Religious interpretation===\nUrsula Nordstrom attributed the book's success partially to \"Protestant ministers and Sunday-school teachers\", who believed that the tree represents \"the Christian ideal of unconditional love.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/books/review/15MARCUSL.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title='Runny Babbit': Hoppity Hip |first=Leonard S. |last=Marcus|date=May 15, 2005|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Environmental interpretation===\nSome people believe that the tree represents [[Mother Nature]] and the boy represents humanity.

The tree is very \"giving\" and the boy evolves into a \"taking\" teenager, man, then elderly man.  Despite the fact that the boy ages in the story, the tree addresses the boy as \"Boy\" his entire life.\n\nIn his childhood, the boy enjoys playing with the tree, climbing her trunk, swinging from her branches, carving \"Me + T (Tree)\" into the bark, and eating her apples. However, as the boy grows older, he spends less time with the tree and tends to visit her only when he wants material items at various stages of his life, or not coming to the tree alone (such as bringing a lady friend to the tree and carving \"Me +Y.L.\" (her initials, often assumed to be an acronym for \"young love\") into the tree. In an effort to make the boy happy at each of these stages, the tree gives him parts of herself, which he can transform into material items, such as money (from her apples), a house (from her branches), and a boat (from her trunk).  With every stage of giving, \"the Tree was happy\".\n\nIn the final pages, both the tree and the boy feel the sting of their respective \"giving\" and \"taking\" nature.  When only a stump remains for the tree (including the carving \"Me + T\"), she is not happy, at least at that moment.  The boy does return as a tired elderly man to meet the tree once more. She tells him she is sad because she cannot provide him shade, apples, or any materials like in the past. He ignores this (because his teeth are too weak for apples, and he is too old to swing on branches and too tired to climb her trunk) and states that all he wants is \"a quiet place to sit and rest,\" which the tree, who is weak being just a stump, could provide.  With this final stage of giving, \"the Tree was happy\".\n\n==Reception==\nInterest in the book increased by [[word of mouth]]; for example, in churches \"it was hailed as a parable on the joys of giving.\"<ref name=NYT1973/>  As of 2001, over 5 million copies of the book had been sold, placing it 14th on a list of hardcover \"All-Time Bestselling Children's Books\" from ''[[Publishers Weekly]].''<ref>{{cite journal |author= Roback, Diane, Jason Britton, and Debbie Hochman Turvey |date= December 17, 2001 |title= All-Time Bestselling Children's Books |journal= Publishers Weekly |volume= 248 |issue= 51 |url= http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20011217/28595-all-time-bestselling-children-s-books.html|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>  By 2011, 8.5 million copies of the book had been sold.<ref name=NYT2011/>\n\nIn a 1999\u20132000 [[National Education Association]] online survey of children, among the \"Kids' Top 100 Books,\" the book was 24th.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13110.htm |title= Kids' Top 100 Books |author= National Education Association |accessdate= May 18, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130201190330/http://www.nea.org/grants/13110.htm |archivedate= February 1, 2013 }}</ref>  Based on a 2007 online \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\" poll by the National Education Association, the book came in third.<ref name=NEA2007>{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref> It was 85th of the \"Top 100 Picture Books\" of all time in a 2012 poll by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.<ref name=SLJPicture2012>{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/06/top-100-picture-books-poll-results/ |title= Top 100 Picture Books Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth | publisher=[[School Library Journal]] \"A Fuse #8 Production\" blog|date= May 18, 2013|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Scholastic Parent & Child]]'' magazine placed it #9 on its list of \"100 Greatest Books for Kids\" in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scholastic.com/100books/pdf/Top_100_Childrens_Books_of_All_Time.pdf|title=Parent & Child 100 Greatest Books for Kids |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2012 |publisher= [[Scholastic Corporation]]|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>  As of 2013, it ranked third on a [[Goodreads]] list of \"Best Children's Books.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.goodreads.com/list/show/86.Best_Children_s_Books|title=Best Children's Books |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2008 |publisher= [[Goodreads]]|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Interpretations ==\n{{weasel words|section|date=April 2015}}\nThere are numerous interpretations of the book, including:<ref name=Samuelsson1998>{{cite journal|last1=Pramling Samuelsson|first1=Ingrid |last2=Mauritzson|first2=Ulla|last3=Asplund Carlsson|first3=Maj|last4=Ueda|first4=Miyoko|title=A Mother and a Friend: Differences in Japanese and Swedish Mothers' Understanding of a Tale|journal=Childhood|volume=5|issue=4|year=1998|pages=493\u2013506|issn=0907-5682|doi=10.1177/0907568298005004008}}</ref><ref name=Fraustino2008>{{cite book |last1=Fraustino |first1=Lisa Rowe |chapter=At the Core of The Giving Tree\u2019s Signifying Apples |pages=284\u2013306  | editor1-first=Annette M.  |editor1-last=Magid | title = You Are What You Eat: Literary Probes into the Palate | publisher = Cambridge Scholars | location = Newcastle, UK | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781847184924 }}</ref>\n\n===Religious interpretation===\nUrsula Nordstrom attributed the book's success partially to \"Protestant ministers and Sunday-school teachers\", who believed that the tree represents \"the Christian ideal of unconditional love.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/books/review/15MARCUSL.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title='Runny Babbit': Hoppity Hip |first=Leonard S. |last=Marcus|date=May 15, 2005|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Environmental interpretation===\nSome people believe that the tree represents [[Mother Nature]] and the boy represents humanity.

{"title_page": "Skywalker family", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Skywalker}}\n{{short description|Fictional family in the Star Wars series}}\nThe '''Skywalker family''' is a fictional family in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. Within the series' [[fictional universe]], the Skywalkers are presented as a bloodline with strong inherent capabilities related to [[the Force]]. [[Luke Skywalker]], his twin sister [[Princess Leia]], and their father [[Darth Vader]] are central characters in the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' film trilogy]]. Darth Vader, in his previous identity as Anakin Skywalker, is a lead character in the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel film trilogy]]. Leia and [[Han Solo]]'s son (and hence Luke's nephew and Anakin's grandson), Ben, plays a crucial role in the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] as the antagonist [[Kylo Ren]].\n\nIn ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'', it is revealed that Han Solo's birth name is not Han Solo. It is revealed that growing up as an orphan in planet Corellia, young Han never knew his true last-name, and that all he remembers is that his father worked in a space-ship factory in Corellia. The last-name Solo is chosen by an impatient Imperial Officer, who wanted to quickly fill a young Han's paper work to join the Imperial Flight Academy, and help him avoid jail. Since the true last-name of Han's father is unknown, Han would be the first Solo, and since his only known child was with Leia (a Skywalker), all members of the [[Solo family]] are part of the Skywalker family.\n\nAt the end of ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'', [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] adopts \"Skywalker\" as her [[surname]], despite being the granddaughter of [[Emperor Palpatine]].<ref>{{cite news |last=McCluskey |first=Megan |title=Breaking Down That Shocking Rey Reveal in ''Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker'' |url=https://time.com/5752170/who-are-reys-parents/ |work=[[Time (magazine) |Time]] |date=December 20, 2019 |accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref> \n\nIn December 2019, after the release of ''The Rise of Skywalker'', Matt Martin, of the Disney LucasFilm Star Wars story group has stated that Palpatine created the insinuation that he created Anakin, but is not the actual acting force.

In this film, [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] discovers Shmi Skywalker and her son Anakin as slaves on the planet [[Tatooine]]. Qui-Gon finds that Anakin has a higher count of [[midi-chlorians]] (Force-imparting microorganisms) than any Jedi, even [[Yoda]], counting to about 20,000. Shmi informs Qui-Gon that Anakin has no father, leading Qui-Gon to suggest that Anakin is a product of midi-chlorians, an example of a [[miraculous birth]]. As the film progresses, Anakin leaves Tatooine to begin his Jedi training.\n\n''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' reveals that, in Anakin's absence, Shmi has married [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Cliegg Lars]], becoming the stepmother of [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Owen]]. Owen tells Anakin they are stepbrothers. Owen later marries [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Beru Whitesun]]. The [[Jedi Order]] had a strict celibacy requirement, which Anakin secretly broke as a Jedi Knight, after he secretly married Naboo Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' Padme dies giving birth to twins, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia]]. Luke is raised by Beru and Owen Lars on Tatooine. Leia is raised by Senator [[Bail Organa]] and Queen [[Breha Organa]] on [[Alderaan (Star Wars)|Alderaan]]. Neither of the twins know of each other's existence, Luke knows his birth last-name but is told his father Anakin is dead, Leia isn't told her last-name. Anakin who became the Sith Lord, known as Darth Vader, is never told his children were born.\n\nIn ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'', it is revealed that Han Solo's birth name is not Han Solo. It is revealed that growing up as an orphan in planet Corelia, young Han never knew his true last-name, and that all he remembers is that his parent worked in a space-ship factory in Corelia. The last-name Solo is chosen by an impatient Imperial Officer, who wanted to quickly fill Han's paper work so Han could join the Imperial Flight Academy. Since the true last-name of Han's father is unknown, Han would be the first Solo. By ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', Han Solo deflected the Empire and became a smuggler, and later joins the [[Rebel Alliance]], where he meets Leia and Luke (who in that film meet for the first time, and they don't learn they're siblings until ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'').\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' it is revealed that Leia is married to [[Han Solo]]. Leia and Han have a son named [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo, who later adopts the name Kylo Ren]]. The family breaks apart following Ben's descent into the dark side, with Leia and Han separating, and Luke disappearing to the planet [[Ahch-To]]. Luke hasn't been revealed to have any children; a possible reason for this could be the celibacy rules of the Jedi. At the end of ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'', all blood-related members of the Skywalker bloodline have seemingly died out, as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo dies and fades into the force. Later, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] adopts \"Skywalker\" as a surname when asked her name by a [[Tatooine]] local in a way to cut ties with her Palpatine lineage and honor the ones she truly consider as her family.\n\n{{Skywalker family tree}}\n<br />\n\n===Shmi Skywalker-Lars===\nShmi Skywalker, portrayed by [[Pernilla August]], is the mother of [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]], paternal grandmother to [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] and maternal great-grandmother to [[Kylo Ren]]. Her first name is derived from [[Lakshmi]], a [[Hindu]] [[goddess]]. She appears in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]''.\n\nIn ''The Phantom Menace'', she and her son are introduced as [[Slavery|slave]]s of junk merchant [[Watto]] on the desert world [[Tatooine]].<ref>''[[Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace]]'' script</ref> She welcomes [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] ([[Liam Neeson]]) into their home, and tells him that Anakin ([[Jake Lloyd]]) has no father; she simply [[Parthenogenesis|became]] [[miraculous births|pregnant]] with him. In spite of her poverty, Shmi tries to give Anakin a good home in the slave quarter of Mos Espa. Qui-Gon helps Anakin win his freedom, but cannot get Shmi out of slavery. She allows Anakin to leave with Qui-Gon, assuring her heartbroken son that they will meet again.\n\nIn ''Attack of the Clones'', Anakin ([[Hayden Christensen]]), now a young adult [[Jedi]] apprentice, senses through [[the Force]] that she is in pain. He travels to Tatooine to find her, and, upon arriving, learns that she had been freed by and married to moisture farmer [[Minor residents of Tatooine#Lars, Cliegg|Cliegg Lars]] ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]), but had recently been abducted by [[Tusken Raiders]]. He finds her inside one of their encampments, but it's too late\u2014beaten and [[torture]]d beyond help, she dies in his arms. Heartbroken and enraged, Anakin slaughters every single Tusken in the camp, including the women and children. His mother's death ignites a strong anger in Anakin, and sets him on the path to becoming [[Darth Vader]].\n\n===Anakin Skywalker===\n{{Main|Darth Vader}}\nAnakin Skywalker is the son of Shmi Skywalker and she told him he was born without a father through the Force. He is the father of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa and maternal grandfather of Kylo Ren. Anakin is discovered on [[Tatooine]] by Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] who is sure that the boy is the \"Chosen One\" of Jedi Prophecy, who will bring balance to the Force. After the death of Qui-Gon, he becomes the [[Jedi#Padawan|Padawan]] of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He also forms a close bond with [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], the young senator of [[Naboo]]. The newly elected Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, Palpatine, also befriends Anakin, promising to watch the boy's progress \"with great interest\" and advise him. Torn between his loyalty to the Jedi and his drive for power, Anakin succumbs to temptation and becomes Darth Vader, willing to protect his loved ones especially Padme. As Darth Vader, Anakin spends the following decades serving under Palpatine's Galactic Empire until reuniting with his son, Luke, redeeming himself by defeating his master to protect him while sacrificing himself in the process.\n\n===Padm\u00e9 Amidala===\n{{Main|Padm\u00e9 Amidala}}\nThe secret wife of Anakin Skywalker, and mother of Luke and Leia and maternal grandmother of Kylo Ren. She served as Queen of Naboo, and later as a Senator for her planet. Her closest friend in the Senate was Senator [[Bail Organa]]. She reconnected and fell in love with Anakin Skywalker after he was assigned to protect her from an assassination attempt, and secretly married him shortly after the Battle of Geonosis. Three years later, she reveals to Anakin that she is pregnant and plans to raise their child on Naboo. She realizes that Anakin has started to have nightmares of her dying in childbirth and assures him that it was just a dream and that it won\u2019t happen. After Anakin turned to the dark side and massacred the Jedi at the Jedi Temple, she was told by Anakin that the Jedi had taken over the Republic. Obi-Wan arrives and asks Padm\u00e9 about her husband's whereabouts and informs her that he has turned to the dark side. Padm\u00e9 accuses Obi-Wan of lying and doesn\u2019t believe that Anakin would kill younglings. Obi-Wan states that Anakin is the father of Padm\u00e9\u2019s child and sets off to find him. Padm\u00e9 tracks Anakin, now [[Darth Vader]], to Mustafar but when she tries to persuade him to abandon the dark side, Vader refuses and force chokes her unconscious when Obi-Wan arrives. Padm\u00e9 gives birth to her children shortly after the first Empire Day. Before she dies, Padm\u00e9 assures Obi-Wan that there is still good in Anakin, before passing away. Obi-Wan and Yoda decided to separate the children in order to keep them hidden from Darth Vader.\n\n===Luke Skywalker===\n\n{{main|Luke Skywalker}}\nLuke Skywalker is the son of Jedi Knight [[Anakin Skywalker]] and Senator of Naboo, [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]. He is taken in by his uncle and aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, after the death of Padm\u00e9 and Anakin's fall to the dark side. He is Force-sensitive and skilled with a lightsaber. In ''Return of the Jedi'', a dying Yoda confirms to Luke, that Darth Vader (previously Anakin Skywalker) is actually his father, despite Luke's belief that Vader's claim to fatherhood in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was a ruse to pull Luke to the dark side. He also finds out from Obi-Wan's [[Force Ghost]] that Princess Leia Organa is his sister. In ''The Force Awakens'', as the last known Jedi, Luke is in hiding after failing to prevent his nephew and apprentice Ben Solo (now Kylo Ren) from turning to the dark side to join [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and has cut himself off from the Force. In ''The Last Jedi'', a young scavenger named [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] has located Luke and tries to convince him to show her the ways of the Force, but he refuses. After knowing the death of Han Solo, he trains Rey about how to use the Force and to become a Jedi. Luke reveals to Rey that he sensed the dark side in Ben and was scared for him, but Ben retaliated by using the Force to collapse the Jedi Temple and leaves him. When he refuses to help Rey turn Ben back to the light, Luke plans to burn the Jedi Temple tree and is greeted by Yoda, who convinces him to help Rey and not to mourn his failure of losing Ben to Snoke. On the planet Crait, Luke appears with his old lightsaber and duels Ben, who tries to attack Luke, but he dodges them. Luke tries to reason with Ben and then disappears, revealing that he was still on the island and that Ben was dueling a Force projection of him. Luke falls to the ground and gets up, and afterwards dies after disappearing, becoming one with the Force.\n\n===Leia Organa===\n\n{{Main|Princess Leia}}\nThe daughter of [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], [[Leia Amidala Skywalker]] raised by Bail and Breha Organa of Alderaan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hidalgo |first=Pablo |title=Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded |date=2016 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=taVyDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20}}</ref> At age 19 she is the Princess of Alderaan, and is captured by Darth Vader while in the [[Tantive IV]] [[blockade runner]] on a so-called \"diplomatic mission\". Leia is shown to be Force-sensitive. In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Leia professes her love for [[Han Solo]] when he is put into carbonite stasis, although it is originally Han and Luke who compete for her affections. In ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', planning to feed Luke, Han, and [[Chewbacca]] to the flesh eating [[Sarlacc]], [[Jabba the Hutt]] is instead strangled to death by Leia by a chain he has on her. She later becomes involved in the Battle of Endor. In the years that follow, she becomes General Organa, the leader of the Resistance, a military organization unofficially backed by the New Republic to counter the First Order.  She married Han Solo and had a son named [[Ben Solo]], later Kylo Ren, whose turning to the dark side separated the couple before the events of ''The Force Awakens''. Leia has been on a search to find her missing brother Luke<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Keefe|first1=Kevin|title=There's Either an Error in the New 'Star Wars' Crawl or a Big Surprise for Luke and Leia|url=http://mic.com/articles/131224/there-s-either-an-error-in-the-new-star-wars-crawl-or-a-big-surprise-for-luke-and-leia|publisher=Mic|accessdate=24 December 2015}}</ref> and find a way to save her son from the dark side.

He initially trains to be a Jedi under his uncle, [[Luke Skywalker]]. Soon, Luke suspects Ben has been influenced by Snoke, and ignites his lightsaber near Ben while he is sleeping in an attempt to kill him. This causes Ben to fall to the dark side. Ben becomes Kylo Ren, working for the First Order and working under the influence of [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and also forms an uneasy alliance with [[General Hux]]. He is obsessed with the legacy of his grandfather, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, and aspires to finish what Vader started: the elimination of the Jedi. He stabs Han Solo, his father, in the heart but spares his mother when ordered to destroy her ship. Ben becoming Kylo Ren also caused Han and Leia to break up, with neither of them able to stop loving their son. Luke confronts him and also disappears trying to stop Ben's actions. After his mother's death, he turns to the light side becoming Ben Solo again. Later, he dies to bring [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] back to life, ending the Skywalker bloodline.\n\n.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{chart top|Skywalker family tree}}\n{{family tree/start}}\n{{family tree| | | | | PAR | ||PAR=Shmi Skywalker's Parents}}\n{{family tree| | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{family tree|CLIEG|~| SHM | | | | ||CLIEG=Cliegg Lars|SHM=Shmi Skywalker Lars}}\n{{family tree| |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{family tree|OWN| | ANI |y|PADME| |ORGf||OWN=Owen Lars|ANI=[[Anakin Skywalker]]|PADME=[[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]|ORGf=House of Organa}}\n{{family tree| |:| | | | | |!| | | | | |:| | |}}\n{{family tree| |L|~|~|7|,|-|^|-|.|F|~|~|J| | |}}\n{{family tree| | | | |LUKEs| |LEIAs|y|HAN| | | ||LUKEs=[[Luke Skywalker]]|HAN=[[Han Solo]]|LEIAs=[[Leia Organa]]|}}\n{{family tree| | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | |}}\n{{family tree| | | | | | |REY| |SOLOf| | | | | ||REY=[[Rey Skywalker]]<br />(honorary)|SOLOf=[[Ben Solo]]}}\n{{family tree/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n==''Legends''==\nThe following characters are exclusive to what is now retroactively known as the ''Legends'' brand since April 2014, and non-canonical to any and all ''Star Wars'' material produced under the ownership of the [[Walt Disney Company]].<ref name=\"THR Legends\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Legends\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page |publisher=[[StarWars.com]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Adult\">{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line |title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of ''Star Wars'' Adult Fiction line |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref> With the 2012 acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]], most of the licensed ''Star Wars'' novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' were rebranded as ''Star Wars Legends'' and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.<ref name=\"THR Legends\"/><ref name=\"SW Legends\"/><ref name=\"SW Adult\"/>\n\nA further complication in this continuity is the fact that the ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' novelization includes a detail about Owen Lars being Obi-Wan Kenobi's estranged brother (rather than the son of a previous marriage, of the man who married Anakin's mother).<ref>{{cite book|title=Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|first=James|last=Kahn|publisher=Del-Rey|isbn=0-345-30767-4|year=1983}}</ref> To explain subsequent references,<ref>{{cite book|title=Jedi Apprentice: The Hidden Past|first=Jude|last=Watson|publisher=Scholastic|isbn=0590519336|year=1999|url=https://archive.org/details/hiddenpast00wats}}</ref> ''Star Wars: Lone Wolf: A Tale of Obi-Wan and Luke''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-other-lost-missions-rare-clone-wars-comics-and-literature-part-2|title=Rare Clone Wars Comics and Literature|publisher=Starwars.com|accessdate=2015-12-24|archivedate=2015-10-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016031555/http://www.starwars.com/news/the-other-lost-missions-rare-clone-wars-comics-and-literature-part-2}}</ref> introduces \"Owen Kenobi\", a personification of the bond Kenobi feels toward Owen Lars.\n\nThe Skywalker bloodline branches from Luke and Leia's descendants, but only Luke's side continues to carry the Skywalker name.\n\n===Luke's descendants in ''Legends''===\nIn the non-canon 'Star Wars Legends' timeline, Luke has one son, named Ben in honor of Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi.\n\n====Mara Jade====\n{{Main|Mara Jade}}\nLuke marries [[Mara Jade]], and they have a son named [[List of Star Wars characters#S|Ben]].\n\n====Ben Skywalker====\nLuke Skywalker and Mara Jade Skywalker's son.

Anakin appears in the ''[[Young Jedi Knights]]'' series by [[Kevin J.

In this film, [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] discovers Shmi Skywalker and her son Anakin as slaves on the planet [[Tatooine]]. Qui-Gon finds that Anakin has a higher count of [[midi-chlorians]] (Force-imparting microorganisms) than any Jedi, even [[Yoda]], counting to about 20,000. Shmi informs Qui-Gon that Anakin has no father, leading Qui-Gon to suggest that Anakin is a product of midi-chlorians, an example of a [[miraculous birth]]. As the film progresses, Anakin leaves Tatooine to begin his Jedi training.\n\n''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' reveals that, in Anakin's absence, Shmi has married [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Cliegg Lars]], becoming the stepmother of [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Owen]]. Owen tells Anakin they are stepbrothers. Owen later marries [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Beru Whitesun]]. The [[Jedi Order]] had a strict celibacy requirement, which Anakin secretly broke as a Jedi Knight, after he secretly married Naboo Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' Padme dies giving birth to twins, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia]]. Luke is raised by Beru and Owen Lars on Tatooine. Leia is raised by Senator [[Bail Organa]] and Queen [[Breha Organa]] on [[Alderaan (Star Wars)|Alderaan]]. Neither of the twins know of each other's existence, Luke knows his birth last-name but is told his father Anakin is dead, Leia isn't told her last-name. Anakin who became the Sith Lord, known as Darth Vader, is never told his children were born.\n\nIn ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'', it is revealed that Han Solo's birth name is not Han Solo. It is revealed that growing up as an orphan in planet Corelia, young Han never knew his true last-name, and that all he remembers is that his parent worked in a space-ship factory in Corelia. The last-name Solo is chosen by an impatient Imperial Officer, who wanted to quickly fill Han's paper work so Han could join the Imperial Flight Academy. Since the true last-name of Han's father is unknown, Han would be the first Solo. By ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', Han Solo deflected the Empire and became a smuggler, and later joins the [[Rebel Alliance]], where he meets Leia and Luke (who in that film meet for the first time, and they don't learn they're siblings until ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'').\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' it is revealed that Leia is married to [[Han Solo]]. Leia and Han have a son named [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo, who later adopts the name Kylo Ren]]. The family breaks apart following Ben's descent into the dark side, with Leia and Han separating, and Luke disappearing to the planet [[Ahch-To]]. Luke hasn't been revealed to have any children; a possible reason for this could be the celibacy rules of the Jedi. At the end of ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'', all blood-related members of the Skywalker bloodline have seemingly died out, as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo dies and fades into the force. Later, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] adopts \"Skywalker\" as a surname when asked her name by a [[Tatooine]] local in a way to cut ties with her Palpatine lineage and honor the ones she truly consider as her family.\n\n{{Skywalker family tree}}\n<br />\n\n===Shmi Skywalker-Lars===\nShmi Skywalker, portrayed by [[Pernilla August]], is the mother of [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]], paternal grandmother to [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] and maternal great-grandmother to [[Kylo Ren]]. Her first name is derived from [[Lakshmi]], a [[Hindu]] [[goddess]]. She appears in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]''.\n\nIn ''The Phantom Menace'', she and her son are introduced as [[Slavery|slave]]s of junk merchant [[Watto]] on the desert world [[Tatooine]].<ref>''[[Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace]]'' script</ref> She welcomes [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] ([[Liam Neeson]]) into their home, and tells him that Anakin ([[Jake Lloyd]]) has no father; she simply [[Parthenogenesis|became]] [[miraculous births|pregnant]] with him. In spite of her poverty, Shmi tries to give Anakin a good home in the slave quarter of Mos Espa. Qui-Gon helps Anakin win his freedom, but cannot get Shmi out of slavery. She allows Anakin to leave with Qui-Gon, assuring her heartbroken son that they will meet again.\n\nIn ''Attack of the Clones'', Anakin ([[Hayden Christensen]]), now a young adult [[Jedi]] apprentice, senses through [[the Force]] that she is in pain. He travels to Tatooine to find her, and, upon arriving, learns that she had been freed by and married to moisture farmer [[Minor residents of Tatooine#Lars, Cliegg|Cliegg Lars]] ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]), but had recently been abducted by [[Tusken Raiders]]. He finds her inside one of their encampments, but it's too late\u2014beaten and [[torture]]d beyond help, she dies in his arms. Heartbroken and enraged, Anakin slaughters every single Tusken in the camp, including the women and children. His mother's death ignites a strong anger in Anakin, and sets him on the path to becoming [[Darth Vader]].\n\n===Anakin Skywalker===\n{{Main|Darth Vader}}\nAnakin Skywalker is the son of Shmi Skywalker and she told him he was born without a father through the Force. He is the father of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa and maternal grandfather of Kylo Ren. Anakin is discovered on [[Tatooine]] by Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] who is sure that the boy is the \"Chosen One\" of Jedi Prophecy, who will bring balance to the Force. After the death of Qui-Gon, he becomes the [[Jedi#Padawan|Padawan]] of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He also forms a close bond with [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], the young senator of [[Naboo]]. The newly elected Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, Palpatine, also befriends Anakin, promising to watch the boy's progress \"with great interest\" and advise him. Torn between his loyalty to the Jedi and his drive for power, Anakin succumbs to temptation and becomes Darth Vader, willing to protect his loved ones especially Padme. As Darth Vader, Anakin spends the following decades serving under Palpatine's Galactic Empire until reuniting with his son, Luke, redeeming himself by defeating his master to protect him while sacrificing himself in the process.\n\n===Padm\u00e9 Amidala===\n{{Main|Padm\u00e9 Amidala}}\nThe secret wife of Anakin Skywalker, and mother of Luke and Leia and maternal grandmother of Kylo Ren. She served as Queen of Naboo, and later as a Senator for her planet. Her closest friend in the Senate was Senator [[Bail Organa]]. She reconnected and fell in love with Anakin Skywalker after he was assigned to protect her from an assassination attempt, and secretly married him shortly after the Battle of Geonosis. Three years later, she reveals to Anakin that she is pregnant and plans to raise their child on Naboo. She realizes that Anakin has started to have nightmares of her dying in childbirth and assures him that it was just a dream and that it won\u2019t happen. After Anakin turned to the dark side and massacred the Jedi at the Jedi Temple, she was told by Anakin that the Jedi had taken over the Republic. Obi-Wan arrives and asks Padm\u00e9 about her husband's whereabouts and informs her that he has turned to the dark side. Padm\u00e9 accuses Obi-Wan of lying and doesn\u2019t believe that Anakin would kill younglings. Obi-Wan states that Anakin is the father of Padm\u00e9\u2019s child and sets off to find him. Padm\u00e9 tracks Anakin, now [[Darth Vader]], to Mustafar but when she tries to persuade him to abandon the dark side, Vader refuses and force chokes her unconscious when Obi-Wan arrives. Padm\u00e9 gives birth to her children shortly after the first Empire Day. Before she dies, Padm\u00e9 assures Obi-Wan that there is still good in Anakin, before passing away. Obi-Wan and Yoda decided to separate the children in order to keep them hidden from Darth Vader.\n\n===Luke Skywalker===\n\n{{main|Luke Skywalker}}\nLuke Skywalker is the son of Jedi Knight [[Anakin Skywalker]] and Senator of Naboo, [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]. He is taken in by his uncle and aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, after the death of Padm\u00e9 and Anakin's fall to the dark side. He is Force-sensitive and skilled with a lightsaber. In ''Return of the Jedi'', a dying Yoda confirms to Luke, that Darth Vader (previously Anakin Skywalker) is actually his father, despite Luke's belief that Vader's claim to fatherhood in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was a ruse to pull Luke to the dark side. He also finds out from Obi-Wan's [[Force Ghost]] that Princess Leia Organa is his sister. In ''The Force Awakens'', as the last known Jedi, Luke is in hiding after failing to prevent his nephew and apprentice Ben Solo (now Kylo Ren) from turning to the dark side to join [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and has cut himself off from the Force. In ''The Last Jedi'', a young scavenger named [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] has located Luke and tries to convince him to show her the ways of the Force, but he refuses. After knowing the death of Han Solo, he trains Rey about how to use the Force and to become a Jedi. Luke reveals to Rey that he sensed the dark side in Ben and was scared for him, but Ben retaliated by using the Force to collapse the Jedi Temple and leaves him. When he refuses to help Rey turn Ben back to the light, Luke plans to burn the Jedi Temple tree and is greeted by Yoda, who convinces him to help Rey and not to mourn his failure of losing Ben to Snoke. On the planet Crait, Luke appears with his old lightsaber and duels Ben, who tries to attack Luke, but he dodges them. Luke tries to reason with Ben and then disappears, revealing that he was still on the island and that Ben was dueling a Force projection of him. Luke falls to the ground and gets up, and afterwards dies after disappearing, becoming one with the Force.\n\n===Leia Organa===\n\n{{Main|Princess Leia}}\nThe daughter of [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], [[Leia Amidala Skywalker]] raised by Bail and Breha Organa of Alderaan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hidalgo |first=Pablo |title=Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded |date=2016 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=taVyDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20}}</ref> At age 19 she is the Princess of Alderaan, and is captured by Darth Vader while in the [[Tantive IV]] [[blockade runner]] on a so-called \"diplomatic mission\". Leia is shown to be Force-sensitive. In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Leia professes her love for [[Han Solo]] when he is put into carbonite stasis, although it is originally Han and Luke who compete for her affections. In ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', planning to feed Luke, Han, and [[Chewbacca]] to the flesh eating [[Sarlacc]], [[Jabba the Hutt]] is instead strangled to death by Leia by a chain he has on her. She later becomes involved in the Battle of Endor. In the years that follow, she becomes General Organa, the leader of the Resistance, a military organization unofficially backed by the New Republic to counter the First Order.  She married Han Solo and had a son named [[Ben Solo]], later Kylo Ren, whose turning to the dark side separated the couple before the events of ''The Force Awakens''.

He initially trains to be a Jedi under his uncle, [[Luke Skywalker]]. Soon, Luke suspects Ben has been influenced by Snoke, and ignites his lightsaber near Ben while he is sleeping in an attempt to kill him. This causes Ben to fall to the dark side. Ben becomes Kylo Ren, working for the First Order and working under the influence of [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and also forms an uneasy alliance with [[General Hux]]. He is obsessed with the legacy of his grandfather, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, and aspires to finish what Vader started: the elimination of the Jedi. He stabs Han Solo, his father, in the heart but spares his mother when ordered to destroy her ship. Ben becoming Kylo Ren also caused Han and Leia to break up, with neither of them able to stop loving their son. Luke confronts him and also disappears trying to stop Ben's actions. After his mother's death, he turns to the light side becoming Ben Solo again. Later, he dies to bring [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] back to life, ending the Skywalker bloodline.\n\n.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{chart top|Skywalker family tree}}\n{{family tree/start}}\n{{family tree| | | | | PAR | ||PAR=Shmi Skywalker's Parents}}\n{{family tree| | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{family tree|CLIEG|~| SHM | | | | ||CLIEG=Cliegg Lars|SHM=Shmi Skywalker Lars}}\n{{family tree| |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{family tree|OWN| | ANI |y|PADME| |ORGf||OWN=Owen Lars|ANI=[[Anakin Skywalker]]|PADME=[[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]|ORGf=House of Organa}}\n{{family tree| |:| | | | | |!| | | | | |:| | |}}\n{{family tree| |L|~|~|7|,|-|^|-|.|F|~|~|J| | |}}\n{{family tree| | | | |LUKEs| |LEIAs|y|HAN| | | ||LUKEs=[[Luke Skywalker]]|HAN=[[Han Solo]]|LEIAs=[[Leia Organa]]|}}\n{{family tree| | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | |}}\n{{family tree| | | | | | |REY| |SOLOf| | | | | ||REY=[[Rey Skywalker]]<br />(honorary)|SOLOf=[[Ben Solo]]}}\n{{family tree/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n==''Legends''==\nThe following characters are exclusive to what is now retroactively known as the ''Legends'' brand since April 2014, and non-canonical to any and all ''Star Wars'' material produced under the ownership of the [[Walt Disney Company]].<ref name=\"THR Legends\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Legends\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page |publisher=[[StarWars.com]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Adult\">{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line |title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of ''Star Wars'' Adult Fiction line |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref> With the 2012 acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]], most of the licensed ''Star Wars'' novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' were rebranded as ''Star Wars Legends'' and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.<ref name=\"THR Legends\"/><ref name=\"SW Legends\"/><ref name=\"SW Adult\"/>\n\nA further complication in this continuity is the fact that the ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' novelization includes a detail about Owen Lars being Obi-Wan Kenobi's estranged brother (rather than the son of a previous marriage, of the man who married Anakin's mother).<ref>{{cite book|title=Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|first=James|last=Kahn|publisher=Del-Rey|isbn=0-345-30767-4|year=1983}}</ref> To explain subsequent references,<ref>{{cite book|title=Jedi Apprentice: The Hidden Past|first=Jude|last=Watson|publisher=Scholastic|isbn=0590519336|year=1999|url=https://archive.org/details/hiddenpast00wats}}</ref> ''Star Wars: Lone Wolf: A Tale of Obi-Wan and Luke''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-other-lost-missions-rare-clone-wars-comics-and-literature-part-2|title=Rare Clone Wars Comics and Literature|publisher=Starwars.com|accessdate=2015-12-24|archivedate=2015-10-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016031555/http://www.starwars.com/news/the-other-lost-missions-rare-clone-wars-comics-and-literature-part-2}}</ref> introduces \"Owen Kenobi\", a personification of the bond Kenobi feels toward Owen Lars.\n\nThe Skywalker bloodline branches from Luke and Leia's descendants, but only Luke's side continues to carry the Skywalker name.\n\n===Luke's descendants in ''Legends''===\nIn the non-canon 'Star Wars Legends' timeline, Luke has one son, named Ben in honor of Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi.\n\n====Mara Jade====\n{{Main|Mara Jade}}\nLuke marries [[Mara Jade]], and they have a son named [[List of Star Wars characters#S|Ben]].\n\n====Ben Skywalker====\nLuke Skywalker and Mara Jade Skywalker's son.

Anakin and his siblings play central roles in other novels such as ''[[The Crystal Star]]'' (1994), the [[Corellian trilogy|''Corellian'' trilogy]] (1995) and ''[[The New Rebellion]]'' (1996). Anakin's birth is featured in [[Tom Veitch]]'s ''[[Dark Empire II]]'' comic book miniseries (May 1995). He is first referred to as Han Solo, Jr. by his father, but Leia corrects him, having named the baby after her biological father, [[Anakin Skywalker]], as a reminder of hope.

Anakin was now an eleven-year-old child starting his training at the [[Jedi Academy]] on [[Yavin 4]].<ref name=\"Golden Globe\"/> Richardson continued Anakin's adventures in the following two novels, ''Lyric's World'' and ''Promises'', before [[Rebecca Moesta]] finished the series with ''Anakin's Quest'', ''Vader's Fortress'', and ''Kenobi's Blade'', starting in 1996.  Anakin appears in the ''[[Young Jedi Knights]]'' series by [[Kevin J. Anderson]] and Rebecca Moesta, which follows the adventures of Anakin's siblings, Jacen and Jaina.\n\nIn 1999, the first novel of the ''[[New Jedi Order]]'' series was published, entitled ''[[Vector Prime]]'' by [[R.A. Salvatore]]. Anakin is now a teenager studying as a Jedi under his uncle, [[Luke Skywalker]], debating with his brother, Jacen, on the ways of a Jedi and the Force. In the novel's [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], his father's co-pilot and best friend, [[Chewbacca]], dies saving Anakin's life.\n\nAnakin plays major roles in ''[[Dark Tide: Onslaught]]'' and ''[[Dark Tide: Ruin]]'' by [[Michael A.

Writers of the ''New Jedi Order'' storyline revealed in a question-and-answer section of the paperback edition of ''[[The Unifying Force]]'' published on August 3, 2004 that Anakin was supposed to be the hero of the story and lead the Jedi Order, but this was changed due to the release of the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel films]], in which the hero was also named ''Anakin''. Instead, he dies in battle at the conclusion of the novel.\n\nEven after Anakin's death, he has been mentioned several times in most following novels, including a possible appearance in ''[[Traitor (Star Wars novel)|Traitor]]'' by [[Matthew Stover]], as a [[Droid (Star Wars)|droid]] in ''[[Betrayal (Star Wars novel)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Aaron Allston]] as Anakin Sal-Solo and in ''[[Backlash (Star Wars novel)|Backlash]]'', where he appeared to his maternal uncle, Luke Skywalker and to Luke's son, [[Ben Skywalker]] by [[Aaron Allston]].\n\nAnakin is portrayed in the earlier books as being a genius and a loner, but is haunted by his name.  In ''Lyric's World'', it is revealed that he loves to take computers apart and put them back together and sees it as a puzzle.<ref>Richardson, N. ''Junior Jedi Knights: Lyric's World.''

Informally known as the '''Houses of Parliament''' after its occupants, the Palace lies on the north bank of the [[River Thames]] in the [[City of Westminster]], in [[central London]], [[England]].\n\nIts name, which derives from the neighbouring [[Westminster Abbey]], may refer to either of two structures: the ''Old Palace'', a [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] building-complex [[Burning of Parliament|destroyed by fire in 1834]], or its replacement, the ''New Palace'' that stands today. The palace is owned by the monarch in right of [[the Crown]] and, for ceremonial purposes, retains its original status as a royal residence. Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and to the [[Lord Speaker]].\n\nThe first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th&nbsp;century, and Westminster became the primary residence of the [[List of English monarchs|Kings of England]] until fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512. After that, it served as the home of the [[Parliament of England]], which had met there since the 13th&nbsp;century, and also as the seat of the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], based in and around [[#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]]. In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament, and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall, the Cloisters of St Stephen's, the [[Chapel of St Mary Undercroft]], and the [[Jewel Tower]].\n\nIn the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace, the architect [[Charles Barry]] won with a design for new buildings in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, specifically inspired by the English [[Perpendicular Gothic]] style of the 14th\u201316th centuries. The remains of the Old Palace (except the detached Jewel Tower) were incorporated into its much larger replacement, which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of {{convert|112,476|m2|ft2|abbr= on}}.<ref name=\"restorationandrenewal.parliament.uk\"/> Part of the New Palace's area of {{Convert|3.24|ha|0}} was reclaimed from the [[River Thames]], which is the setting of its nearly {{convert|300|m|ft|adj= mid|long}} fa\u00e7ade,<ref name=\"restorationandrenewal.parliament.uk\"/> called the River Front. [[Augustus Pugin]], a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style, assisted Barry and  designed the interior of the Palace. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for 30 years, suffering great delays and cost overruns, as well as the death of both leading architects; works for the interior decoration continued intermittently well into the 20th&nbsp;century. Major conservation work has taken place since then to reverse the effects of London's [[air pollution]], and extensive repairs followed the Second World War, including the reconstruction of the Commons Chamber following its bombing in 1941.\n\nThe Palace is one of the centres of [[Politics of the United Kingdom|political life in the United Kingdom]]; \"Westminster\" has become a [[metonym]] for the UK Parliament and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]], and the [[Westminster system]] of government commemorates the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower, in particular, often referred to by the name of its main bell, [[Big Ben]], has become an iconic landmark of London and of the United Kingdom in general, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city, and an emblem of parliamentary democracy. Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] of Russia called the new palace \"a dream in stone\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Boyne\n | first1 = Harry\n | author-link1 = \n | title = The Houses of Parliament\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JjUMAQAAMAAJ\n | publisher = Larousse\n | date = 1981\n | page = 23\n | isbn = 9780883322598\n | access-date = 19 March 2019\n | quote = Tsar Nicholas I of Russia called it ''un reve en pierre'' (a dream in stone), and that is the romantic impression it must have created upon many millions of sightseers.\n}}\n</ref><ref name = helmguardian>\n{{Cite news\n|url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/14/secret-report-palace-westminster-grave-risk-fire-saftey\n|title= Parliament burned down 183 years ago.

Soane's ceremonial entrance is on the far-right.\n }}\nThe Palace of Westminster site was strategically important during the [[Middle Ages]], as it was located on the banks of the [[River Thames]]. Known in medieval times as [[Thorney Island (London)|Thorney Island]], the site may have been first-used for a royal residence by [[Canute the Great]] during his reign from 1016 to 1035. [[Edward the Confessor|St Edward the Confessor]], the penultimate Anglo-Saxon monarch of England, built a royal palace on Thorney Island just west of the [[City of London]] at about the same time as he built [[Westminster Abbey]] (1045\u20131050). Thorney Island and the surrounding area soon became known as Westminster (a contraction of the words ''West [[Minster (church)|Minster]]''). Neither the buildings used by the Anglo-Saxons nor those used by William&nbsp;I survive. The oldest existing part of the Palace (Westminster Hall) dates from the reign of William&nbsp;I's successor, [[William II of England|King William&nbsp;II]].\n\nThe Palace of Westminster was the monarch's principal residence in the late Medieval period. The predecessor of Parliament, the ''[[Curia Regis]]'' (Royal Council), met in Westminster Hall (although it followed the King when he moved to other palaces). [[Montfort's Parliament|Simon de Montfort's parliament]], the first to include representatives of the major towns, met at the Palace in 1265. The \"[[Model Parliament]]\", the first official Parliament of England, met there in 1295,<ref name=\"Factsheet G03\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf |title=A Brief Chronology of the House of Commons |date=April 2009 |publisher=House of Commons Information Office |accessdate=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623010012/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2015 |df= }}</ref> and almost all subsequent English Parliaments and then, after 1707, all British Parliaments have met at the Palace.\n\n[[File:A Panoramic View of London, from the Tower of St. Margaret's Church, Westminster (detail 04, Palace of Westminster).jpg|thumb|Detail from ''[[A Panoramic View of London, from the Tower of St. Margaret's Church, Westminster]]'' (1815) by [[Pierre Pr\u00e9vost]], showing the Palace of Westminster.

Renaming it the Palace of Whitehall, Henry used it as his principal residence. Although Westminster officially remained a royal palace, it was used by the two Houses of Parliament and by the various royal law courts.\n\n[[File:John Roque map detail, Palace of Westminster.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|alt=The Old Palace was a complex of buildings, separated from the River Thames in the east by a series of gardens. The largest and northernmost building is Westminster Hall, which lies parallel to the river. Several buildings adjoin it on the east side; south of those and perpendicular to the Hall is the mediaeval House of Commons. Further south and parallel to the river is the Court of Requests, with an eastwards extension at its south end, and at the south end of the complex lie the House of Lords and another chamber. The Palace was bounded by St Margaret's Street to the west and Old Palace Yard to the south-west; another street, New Palace Yard, is just visible to the north.|A detail from [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746|John Rocque's 1746 map of London]]. [[St Stephen's Chapel]], labelled \"H of Comm\" (House of Commons), was adjacent to Westminster Hall; the Parliament Chamber\u2014labelled \"H of L\" (House of Lords)\u2014and the Prince's Chamber were to the far south. The Court of Requests, between the two Houses, would become the new home of the Lords in 1801. At the north-east, by the river, stood Speaker's House.]]\n\nBecause it was originally a royal residence, the Palace included no purpose-built chambers for the two Houses. Important state ceremonies were held in the [[Painted Chamber]] which had been originally built in the 13th century as the main bedchamber for [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]]. In 1801 the Upper House moved into the larger [[White Chamber]] (also known as the Lesser Hall), which had housed the [[Court of Requests]]; the expansion of the Peerage by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] during the 18th century, along with the imminent [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union with Ireland]], necessitated the move, as the original chamber could not accommodate the increased number of peers.\n\nThe House of Commons, which did not have a chamber of its own, sometimes held its debates in the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey. The Commons acquired a permanent home at the Palace in [[St Stephen's Chapel]], the former chapel of the royal palace, during the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. In 1547 the building became available for the Commons' use following the disbanding of St Stephen's College. Alterations were made to St Stephen's Chapel over the following three centuries for the convenience of the lower House, gradually destroying, or covering up, its original mediaeval appearance. A major renovation project undertaken by [[Christopher Wren]] in the late 17th century completely redesigned the building's interior.\n\nThe Palace of Westminster as a whole began to see significant alterations from the 18th century onwards, as Parliament struggled to carry out its business in the limited available space and ageing buildings. Calls for an entirely new palace went unheeded as instead more buildings of varying quality and style were added. A new west fa\u00e7ade, known as the Stone Building, facing onto St Margaret's Street was designed by [[John Vardy]] built in the Palladian style between 1755 and 1770, providing more space for document storage and committee rooms. The House of Commons Engrossing Office of Robert Gunnell (1724\u20131794) and Edward Barwell was on the lower floor beside the corner tower at the west side of Vardy's western fa\u00e7ade. A new official residence for the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] was built adjoining St Stephen's Chapel and completed in 1795. The [[neo-Gothic]] architect [[James Wyatt]] also carried out works on both the House of Lords and Commons between 1799 and 1801, including alterations to the exterior of St Stephen's Chapel and a much-derided new neo-Gothic building, referred to by Wyatt's critics as \"The Cotton Mill\" adjoining the House of Lords and facing onto Old Palace Yard.\n\nThe palace complex was substantially remodelled, this time by [[John Soane|Sir John Soane]], between 1824 and 1827. The medieval House of Lords chamber, which had been the target of the failed [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605, was demolished as part of this work in order to create a new Royal Gallery and ceremonial entrance at the southern end of the palace. Soane's work at the palace also included new library facilities for both Houses of Parliament and new law courts for the [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] and [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]]. Soane's alterations caused controversy owing to his use of [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] architectural styles, which conflicted with the Gothic style of the original buildings.\n\n=== Fire and reconstruction ===\n\n{{main|Burning of Parliament}}\n[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner, English - The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons, October 16, 1834 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting|[[J.

In the resulting conflagration both Houses of Parliament were destroyed, along with most of the other buildings in the palace complex. Westminster Hall was saved thanks to fire-fighting efforts and a change in the direction of the wind.

Thanks to its location, it is a place where members of the Lords meet to discuss business of the House. Several doors lead out of the room, to the [[Division of the assembly|division]] lobbies of the House of Lords and to a number of important offices.<ref name=\"Lords Route tour\"/>\n\nThe theme of the Prince's Chamber is Tudor history, and 28 oil portraits painted on panels around the room depict members of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. They are the work of [[Richard Burchett]] and his pupils, and their creation entailed extensive research, which contributed to the founding of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in 1856. 12 bronze bas-reliefs are set into the wall below the portraits, executed by [[William Theed]] in 1855\u20131857.<ref name=\"Lords Route tour\"/> Scenes included are ''The [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]'', ''The Escape of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]'' and ''[[Walter Raleigh|Raleigh]] Spreading His Cloak As a Carpet for the Queen''.<ref>[[#Guide|''Guide to the Palace of Westminster'']], pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Above the portraits, at window level, there are compartments intended for copies of six of the ten [[Armada tapestries]], which hung in the chamber of the House of Lords until their destruction in the 1834 fire and depicted the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.

The lavishly decorated room measures {{Convert|13.7|by|24.4|m|ft|0}}.<ref name=\"Factsheet G11\"/> The benches in the Chamber, as well as other furnishings in the Lords' side of the Palace, are coloured red. The upper part of the Chamber is decorated by stained glass windows and by six allegorical frescoes representing religion, chivalry and law.\n\nAt the south end of the Chamber are the ornate gold Canopy and Throne; although the Sovereign may theoretically occupy the Throne during any sitting, he or she attends only the State Opening of Parliament. Other members of the Royal Family who attend the State Opening use Chairs of State next to the Throne, and peers' sons are always entitled to sit on the steps of the Throne. In front of the Throne is the [[Woolsack]], an armless red cushion stuffed with [[wool]], representing the historical importance of the wool trade, and used by the officer presiding over the House (the [[Lord Speaker]] since 2006, but historically the [[Lord Chancellor]] or a deputy). The House's [[Ceremonial mace|mace]], which represents royal authority, is placed on the back of the Woolsack. In front of the Woolsack is the Judges' Woolsack, a larger red cushion that used to be occupied during the State Opening by the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] (who were members of the House of Lords), and prospectively by the Supreme Court Justices and other Judges (whether or not members), to represent the Judicial Branch of Government. The Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, is in front.\n\nMembers of the House occupy red benches on three sides of the Chamber. The benches on the Lord Speaker's right form the Spiritual Side and those to his left form the Temporal Side. The [[Lords Spiritual]] (archbishops and bishops of the established [[Church of England]]) all occupy the Spiritual Side. The [[Lords Temporal]] ([[Peerage|nobles]]) sit according to party affiliation: members of the Government party sit on the Spiritual Side, while those of the Opposition sit on the Temporal Side. Some peers, who have no party affiliation, sit on the benches in the middle of the House opposite the Woolsack; they are accordingly known as [[crossbencher]]s.\n\n[[File:Passing of the Parliament Bill, 1911 - Project Gutenberg eText 19609.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Drawing|The passage of the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. Votes in both Houses of Parliament are conducted in the form of [[Division of the assembly|divisions]].]]\n\nThe Lords Chamber is the site of nationally televised ceremonies, the most important of which is the [[State Opening of Parliament]], which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session, either after a General Election or in the autumn. At this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented: the Crown (both literally, and figuratively in the person of the Sovereign), The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Commons, (who together form the Legislature), the Judiciary (although no judges are members of either House of Parliament), and the Executive (both [[Minister of the Crown|Government Ministers]], and ceremonial military units in attendance on the Sovereign); and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large Royal Gallery immediately outside the Chamber. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the [[Speech from the Throne]], outlining the Government's programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons may not enter the Lords' debating floor; instead, they watch the proceedings from beyond the Bar of the House, just inside the door. A small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session, when the Sovereign is merely represented by a group of [[Lords Commissioners]].\n\nFollowing the Blitz, which destroyed the chamber of the House of Commons, the Lords' chamber was occupied by the Commons. The Lords temporarily used the Robing Room during the reconstruction. The State Opening Of Parliament was carried out as normal, with the new rooms being used. Evidence can still be seen of this today, with damage clearly visible on one of the doors where they were struck by Black Rod.\n\n=== Peers' Lobby ===\n\nDirectly north of the Lords Chamber lies the Peers' Lobby, an [[antechamber]] where Lords can informally discuss or negotiate matters during sittings of the House, as well as collect messages from the [[Doorkeeper (Houses of Parliament)|doorkeepers]], who control access to the Chamber. The Lobby is a square room measuring {{Convert|12|m|ft}} on each side and {{Convert|10|m|ft}} in height,<ref name=\"Factsheet G11\"/> and one of its main features is the floor centrepiece, a radiant Tudor rose made of Derbyshire marbles and set within an octagon of engraved brass plates.<ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson (2005)]], p. 16.</ref> The rest of the floor is paved with encaustic tiles featuring heraldic designs and Latin mottoes. The walls are faced with white stone and each is pierced by a doorway; above the arches are displayed arms representing the six royal dynasties which ruled England until Queen Victoria's reign ([[House of Wessex|Saxon]], [[Norman dynasty|Norman]], [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]], [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]], [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] and [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]]), and between them there are windows stained with the arms of the early aristocratic families of England.<ref>[[#Guide|''Guide to the Palace of Westminster'']], pp. 47\u201349.</ref>\n\nOf the doorways, the one to the south\u2014which leads into the Lords Chamber\u2014is the most magnificent, and sports much gilding and decoration, including the full royal arms.

Its location halfway between the two debating chambers has led constitutional theorist [[Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|Erskine May]] to describe the Lobby as \"the political centre of the British Empire\",<ref>[[#Quinault|Quinault (1992)]], p. 93.</ref> and allows a person standing under the great chandelier to see both the Royal Throne and the Speaker's Chair, provided that all the intervening doors are open.

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Informally known as the '''Houses of Parliament''' after its occupants, the Palace lies on the north bank of the [[River Thames]] in the [[City of Westminster]], in [[central London]], [[England]].\n\nIts name, which derives from the neighbouring [[Westminster Abbey]], may refer to either of two structures: the ''Old Palace'', a [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] building-complex [[Burning of Parliament|destroyed by fire in 1834]], or its replacement, the ''New Palace'' that stands today. The palace is owned by the monarch in right of [[the Crown]] and, for ceremonial purposes, retains its original status as a royal residence. Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and to the [[Lord Speaker]].\n\nThe first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th&nbsp;century, and Westminster became the primary residence of the [[List of English monarchs|Kings of England]] until fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512. After that, it served as the home of the [[Parliament of England]], which had met there since the 13th&nbsp;century, and also as the seat of the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], based in and around [[#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]]. In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament, and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall, the Cloisters of St Stephen's, the [[Chapel of St Mary Undercroft]], and the [[Jewel Tower]].\n\nIn the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace, the architect [[Charles Barry]] won with a design for new buildings in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, specifically inspired by the English [[Perpendicular Gothic]] style of the 14th\u201316th centuries. The remains of the Old Palace (except the detached Jewel Tower) were incorporated into its much larger replacement, which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of {{convert|112,476|m2|ft2|abbr= on}}.<ref name=\"restorationandrenewal.parliament.uk\"/> Part of the New Palace's area of {{Convert|3.24|ha|0}} was reclaimed from the [[River Thames]], which is the setting of its nearly {{convert|300|m|ft|adj= mid|long}} fa\u00e7ade,<ref name=\"restorationandrenewal.parliament.uk\"/> called the River Front. [[Augustus Pugin]], a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style, assisted Barry and  designed the interior of the Palace. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for 30 years, suffering great delays and cost overruns, as well as the death of both leading architects; works for the interior decoration continued intermittently well into the 20th&nbsp;century. Major conservation work has taken place since then to reverse the effects of London's [[air pollution]], and extensive repairs followed the Second World War, including the reconstruction of the Commons Chamber following its bombing in 1941.\n\nThe Palace is one of the centres of [[Politics of the United Kingdom|political life in the United Kingdom]]; \"Westminster\" has become a [[metonym]] for the UK Parliament and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]], and the [[Westminster system]] of government commemorates the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower, in particular, often referred to by the name of its main bell, [[Big Ben]], has become an iconic landmark of London and of the United Kingdom in general, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city, and an emblem of parliamentary democracy. Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] of Russia called the new palace \"a dream in stone\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Boyne\n | first1 = Harry\n | author-link1 = \n | title = The Houses of Parliament\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JjUMAQAAMAAJ\n | publisher = Larousse\n | date = 1981\n | page = 23\n | isbn = 9780883322598\n | access-date = 19 March 2019\n | quote = Tsar Nicholas I of Russia called it ''un reve en pierre'' (a dream in stone), and that is the romantic impression it must have created upon many millions of sightseers.\n}}\n</ref><ref name = helmguardian>\n{{Cite news\n|url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/14/secret-report-palace-westminster-grave-risk-fire-saftey\n|title= Parliament burned down 183 years ago.

Soane's ceremonial entrance is on the far-right.\n }}\nThe Palace of Westminster site was strategically important during the [[Middle Ages]], as it was located on the banks of the [[River Thames]]. Known in medieval times as [[Thorney Island (London)|Thorney Island]], the site may have been first-used for a royal residence by [[Canute the Great]] during his reign from 1016 to 1035. [[Edward the Confessor|St Edward the Confessor]], the penultimate Anglo-Saxon monarch of England, built a royal palace on Thorney Island just west of the [[City of London]] at about the same time as he built [[Westminster Abbey]] (1045\u20131050). Thorney Island and the surrounding area soon became known as Westminster (a contraction of the words ''West [[Minster (church)|Minster]]''). Neither the buildings used by the Anglo-Saxons nor those used by William&nbsp;I survive. The oldest existing part of the Palace (Westminster Hall) dates from the reign of William&nbsp;I's successor, [[William II of England|King William&nbsp;II]].\n\nThe Palace of Westminster was the monarch's principal residence in the late Medieval period. The predecessor of Parliament, the ''[[Curia Regis]]'' (Royal Council), met in Westminster Hall (although it followed the King when he moved to other palaces). [[Montfort's Parliament|Simon de Montfort's parliament]], the first to include representatives of the major towns, met at the Palace in 1265. The \"[[Model Parliament]]\", the first official Parliament of England, met there in 1295,<ref name=\"Factsheet G03\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf |title=A Brief Chronology of the House of Commons |date=April 2009 |publisher=House of Commons Information Office |accessdate=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623010012/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2015 |df= }}</ref> and almost all subsequent English Parliaments and then, after 1707, all British Parliaments have met at the Palace.\n\n[[File:A Panoramic View of London, from the Tower of St. Margaret's Church, Westminster (detail 04, Palace of Westminster).jpg|thumb|Detail from ''[[A Panoramic View of London, from the Tower of St. Margaret's Church, Westminster]]'' (1815) by [[Pierre Pr\u00e9vost]], showing the Palace of Westminster.

Renaming it the Palace of Whitehall, Henry used it as his principal residence. Although Westminster officially remained a royal palace, it was used by the two Houses of Parliament and by the various royal law courts.\n\n[[File:John Roque map detail, Palace of Westminster.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|alt=The Old Palace was a complex of buildings, separated from the River Thames in the east by a series of gardens. The largest and northernmost building is Westminster Hall, which lies parallel to the river. Several buildings adjoin it on the east side; south of those and perpendicular to the Hall is the mediaeval House of Commons. Further south and parallel to the river is the Court of Requests, with an eastwards extension at its south end, and at the south end of the complex lie the House of Lords and another chamber. The Palace was bounded by St Margaret's Street to the west and Old Palace Yard to the south-west; another street, New Palace Yard, is just visible to the north.|A detail from [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746|John Rocque's 1746 map of London]]. [[St Stephen's Chapel]], labelled \"H of Comm\" (House of Commons), was adjacent to Westminster Hall; the Parliament Chamber\u2014labelled \"H of L\" (House of Lords)\u2014and the Prince's Chamber were to the far south. The Court of Requests, between the two Houses, would become the new home of the Lords in 1801. At the north-east, by the river, stood Speaker's House.]]\n\nBecause it was originally a royal residence, the Palace included no purpose-built chambers for the two Houses. Important state ceremonies were held in the [[Painted Chamber]] which had been originally built in the 13th century as the main bedchamber for [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]]. In 1801 the Upper House moved into the larger [[White Chamber]] (also known as the Lesser Hall), which had housed the [[Court of Requests]]; the expansion of the Peerage by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] during the 18th century, along with the imminent [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union with Ireland]], necessitated the move, as the original chamber could not accommodate the increased number of peers.\n\nThe House of Commons, which did not have a chamber of its own, sometimes held its debates in the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey. The Commons acquired a permanent home at the Palace in [[St Stephen's Chapel]], the former chapel of the royal palace, during the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. In 1547 the building became available for the Commons' use following the disbanding of St Stephen's College. Alterations were made to St Stephen's Chapel over the following three centuries for the convenience of the lower House, gradually destroying, or covering up, its original mediaeval appearance. A major renovation project undertaken by [[Christopher Wren]] in the late 17th century completely redesigned the building's interior.\n\nThe Palace of Westminster as a whole began to see significant alterations from the 18th century onwards, as Parliament struggled to carry out its business in the limited available space and ageing buildings. Calls for an entirely new palace went unheeded as instead more buildings of varying quality and style were added. A new west fa\u00e7ade, known as the Stone Building, facing onto St Margaret's Street was designed by [[John Vardy]] built in the Palladian style between 1755 and 1770, providing more space for document storage and committee rooms. The House of Commons Engrossing Office of Robert Gunnell (1724\u20131794) and Edward Barwell was on the lower floor beside the corner tower at the west side of Vardy's western fa\u00e7ade. A new official residence for the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] was built adjoining St Stephen's Chapel and completed in 1795. The [[neo-Gothic]] architect [[James Wyatt]] also carried out works on both the House of Lords and Commons between 1799 and 1801, including alterations to the exterior of St Stephen's Chapel and a much-derided new neo-Gothic building, referred to by Wyatt's critics as \"The Cotton Mill\" adjoining the House of Lords and facing onto Old Palace Yard.\n\nThe palace complex was substantially remodelled, this time by [[John Soane|Sir John Soane]], between 1824 and 1827. The medieval House of Lords chamber, which had been the target of the failed [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605, was demolished as part of this work in order to create a new Royal Gallery and ceremonial entrance at the southern end of the palace. Soane's work at the palace also included new library facilities for both Houses of Parliament and new law courts for the [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] and [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]]. Soane's alterations caused controversy owing to his use of [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] architectural styles, which conflicted with the Gothic style of the original buildings.\n\n=== Fire and reconstruction ===\n\n{{main|Burning of Parliament}}\n[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner, English - The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons, October 16, 1834 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting|[[J.

In the resulting conflagration both Houses of Parliament were destroyed, along with most of the other buildings in the palace complex. Westminster Hall was saved thanks to fire-fighting efforts and a change in the direction of the wind.

Thanks to its location, it is a place where members of the Lords meet to discuss business of the House. Several doors lead out of the room, to the [[Division of the assembly|division]] lobbies of the House of Lords and to a number of important offices.<ref name=\"Lords Route tour\"/>\n\nThe theme of the Prince's Chamber is Tudor history, and 28 oil portraits painted on panels around the room depict members of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. They are the work of [[Richard Burchett]] and his pupils, and their creation entailed extensive research, which contributed to the founding of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in 1856. 12 bronze bas-reliefs are set into the wall below the portraits, executed by [[William Theed]] in 1855\u20131857.<ref name=\"Lords Route tour\"/> Scenes included are ''The [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]'', ''The Escape of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]'' and ''[[Walter Raleigh|Raleigh]] Spreading His Cloak As a Carpet for the Queen''.<ref>[[#Guide|''Guide to the Palace of Westminster'']], pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Above the portraits, at window level, there are compartments intended for copies of six of the ten [[Armada tapestries]], which hung in the chamber of the House of Lords until their destruction in the 1834 fire and depicted the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.

The lavishly decorated room measures {{Convert|13.7|by|24.4|m|ft|0}}.<ref name=\"Factsheet G11\"/> The benches in the Chamber, as well as other furnishings in the Lords' side of the Palace, are coloured red. The upper part of the Chamber is decorated by stained glass windows and by six allegorical frescoes representing religion, chivalry and law.\n\nAt the south end of the Chamber are the ornate gold Canopy and Throne; although the Sovereign may theoretically occupy the Throne during any sitting, he or she attends only the State Opening of Parliament. Other members of the Royal Family who attend the State Opening use Chairs of State next to the Throne, and peers' sons are always entitled to sit on the steps of the Throne. In front of the Throne is the [[Woolsack]], an armless red cushion stuffed with [[wool]], representing the historical importance of the wool trade, and used by the officer presiding over the House (the [[Lord Speaker]] since 2006, but historically the [[Lord Chancellor]] or a deputy). The House's [[Ceremonial mace|mace]], which represents royal authority, is placed on the back of the Woolsack. In front of the Woolsack is the Judges' Woolsack, a larger red cushion that used to be occupied during the State Opening by the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] (who were members of the House of Lords), and prospectively by the Supreme Court Justices and other Judges (whether or not members), to represent the Judicial Branch of Government. The Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, is in front.\n\nMembers of the House occupy red benches on three sides of the Chamber. The benches on the Lord Speaker's right form the Spiritual Side and those to his left form the Temporal Side. The [[Lords Spiritual]] (archbishops and bishops of the established [[Church of England]]) all occupy the Spiritual Side. The [[Lords Temporal]] ([[Peerage|nobles]]) sit according to party affiliation: members of the Government party sit on the Spiritual Side, while those of the Opposition sit on the Temporal Side. Some peers, who have no party affiliation, sit on the benches in the middle of the House opposite the Woolsack; they are accordingly known as [[crossbencher]]s.\n\n[[File:Passing of the Parliament Bill, 1911 - Project Gutenberg eText 19609.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Drawing|The passage of the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. Votes in both Houses of Parliament are conducted in the form of [[Division of the assembly|divisions]].]]\n\nThe Lords Chamber is the site of nationally televised ceremonies, the most important of which is the [[State Opening of Parliament]], which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session, either after a General Election or in the autumn. At this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented: the Crown (both literally, and figuratively in the person of the Sovereign), The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Commons, (who together form the Legislature), the Judiciary (although no judges are members of either House of Parliament), and the Executive (both [[Minister of the Crown|Government Ministers]], and ceremonial military units in attendance on the Sovereign); and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large Royal Gallery immediately outside the Chamber. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the [[Speech from the Throne]], outlining the Government's programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons may not enter the Lords' debating floor; instead, they watch the proceedings from beyond the Bar of the House, just inside the door. A small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session, when the Sovereign is merely represented by a group of [[Lords Commissioners]].\n\nFollowing the Blitz, which destroyed the chamber of the House of Commons, the Lords' chamber was occupied by the Commons. The Lords temporarily used the Robing Room during the reconstruction. The State Opening Of Parliament was carried out as normal, with the new rooms being used. Evidence can still be seen of this today, with damage clearly visible on one of the doors where they were struck by Black Rod.\n\n=== Peers' Lobby ===\n\nDirectly north of the Lords Chamber lies the Peers' Lobby, an [[antechamber]] where Lords can informally discuss or negotiate matters during sittings of the House, as well as collect messages from the [[Doorkeeper (Houses of Parliament)|doorkeepers]], who control access to the Chamber. The Lobby is a square room measuring {{Convert|12|m|ft}} on each side and {{Convert|10|m|ft}} in height,<ref name=\"Factsheet G11\"/> and one of its main features is the floor centrepiece, a radiant Tudor rose made of Derbyshire marbles and set within an octagon of engraved brass plates.<ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson (2005)]], p. 16.</ref> The rest of the floor is paved with encaustic tiles featuring heraldic designs and Latin mottoes. The walls are faced with white stone and each is pierced by a doorway; above the arches are displayed arms representing the six royal dynasties which ruled England until Queen Victoria's reign ([[House of Wessex|Saxon]], [[Norman dynasty|Norman]], [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]], [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]], [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] and [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]]), and between them there are windows stained with the arms of the early aristocratic families of England.<ref>[[#Guide|''Guide to the Palace of Westminster'']], pp. 47\u201349.</ref>\n\nOf the doorways, the one to the south\u2014which leads into the Lords Chamber\u2014is the most magnificent, and sports much gilding and decoration, including the full royal arms.

Its location halfway between the two debating chambers has led constitutional theorist [[Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|Erskine May]] to describe the Lobby as \"the political centre of the British Empire\",<ref>[[#Quinault|Quinault (1992)]], p. 93.</ref> and allows a person standing under the great chandelier to see both the Royal Throne and the Speaker's Chair, provided that all the intervening doors are open.
