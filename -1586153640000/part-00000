This town is also historically known as the burial site for the body of Native American sports legend [[Jim Thorpe]].\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\n[[File:Central Railroad of New Jersey Station, Jim Thorpe, PA 01.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Central Railroad of New Jersey Station (Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania)|Central Railroad of New Jersey Station]], now a visitors center]]\n'''Jim Thorpe''' was founded in 1818 as '''Mauch Chunk''' {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|m|\u0254\u02d0|k|_|\u02c8|t\u0283|\u028c|\u014b|k}}, a name derived from the term ''Mawsch Unk'' (Bear Place) in the language of the native Munsee-Lenape [[Lenape|Delaware peoples]]: possibly a reference to Bear Mountain, an extension of Mauch Chunk Ridge that resembled a sleeping bear, or perhaps the original profile of the ridge, which has since been changed heavily by 220 years of mining. The [[company town]] was founded by [[Josiah White]] and his two partners, founders of the [[Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company]] (LC&N). The town would be the lower terminus of a [[gravity railroad]], the [[#Mauch Chunk Switchback Gravity Railroad|Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad]], which would bring coal to the head of the LC&N [[Lehigh Canal]] for transshipment to the confluence of the [[Delaware River]], {{convert|43|km|1}} downstream at Easton. It would thereby ship LC&N's coal to [[Philadelphia]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New York City]], and other large cities in [[New Jersey]] and [[Delaware]], and by ocean to the whole [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Canal shipping was eventually replaced by railroad shipping.\n===Coal mining and the LC&N canal===\nThe town grew slowly in its first decade, then rapidly around 1818 grew larger as it became an anthracite [[coal]]-shipping center.  (The other large city with growing coal mining in the region was [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], with a population of over 140,000.) Mauch Chunk is on a Lehigh River west side (right bank) flat where Mahoning Creek enters and is a tributary of the [[Lehigh River]]. The river's left bank community of [[East Mauch Chunk]], which has more of the houses of modern Jim Thorpe, was settled later to support the short-lived Beaver Creek Railroad, the mines which spawned it, and the logging industry. It came into greater growth when the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] in 1885 pushed up the valley on the river's east bank to oppose LC&N's effective transportation monopoly over the region, which extended across to northwest Wilkes-Barre at [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]] on the [[Susquehanna River]]/[[Pennsylvania Canal]]. (See [[Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad]], a subsidiary of LC&N.)\n\n===Railroad growth and coal shipping===\nAfter the Pennsylvania Canal Commission smoothed the way, Lehigh Coal & Navigation built the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (L&S) from Pittston to Ashley, building the [[Ashley Planes]] [[inclined railway]] and linked that by rail from [[Mountain Top, Pennsylvania|Mountain Top]] to [[White Haven, Pennsylvania|White Haven]] at the head of the canal's upper works&mdash;referred to as the \"Grand Lehigh Canal\"&mdash;which navigations shortened the Lehigh Gorge (now located in the [[Lehigh Gorge State Park]]) route, cutting the distance from Philadelphia to Wilkes-Barre and the [[Wyoming Valley]] coal deposits by over {{convert|100|mi|-1}}. This placed Mauch Chunk in the center of a nexus of transportation in country tough to travel through. When floods wiped out many of the upper Lehigh Canal works in 1861, the L&S Railroad was extended through the gap to supplant the canal, and the so-called switchback-twisted backtrack through [[Avoca, Pennsylvania|Avoca]], with the improved engines of the day, enabled two-way steam locomotive traction and traffic despite the steep grades. Owner LC&N Company's headquarters was built across the street in Mauch Chunk from the L&S Railroad's stylish brick passenger station that was soon boarding passengers onto trains from New York and Philadelphia to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. The Central Railroad of New Jersey eventually took over the L&S and the station. The Lehigh Valley Railroad arrived on the river's east bank at East Mauch Chunk in 1855.,<ref>Jom Thorpe/Lehigh Valley Station wikipedia</ref>\n\n===Major historical events===\nMauch Chunk was the location of one of the trials of the [[Molly Maguires]] in 1876, which resulted in the [[hanging]] of four men found guilty of murder.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07E0D61E3FE73BBC4F51DFB566838D669FDE The Molly Maguires; Approaching Trial of the Murderers of John P.

The town's citizens had paid for her, a Thorpe son and Jim's body to be shipped from California, paid and arranged for the funeral service at St. Benedict's Catholic church, and paid for the mausoleum costs at Fairview Cemetery. Then Gov. Johnston Murray vetoed a bill which would contribute funds to the erection of the memorial at Athletic Park. On Sept. 1st Mrs. Thorpe, saying she feared Jim would be buried in a potter's field, shipped the body to Tulsa where she said the Chamber of Commerce was going to build a proper memorial, which was not true.<ref>{{cite news| last=Hagerty| first=James R.| title=Is There Life After Jim Thorpe for Jim Thorpe, Pa.?| newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| date=July 21, 2010| page=A14}}</ref> When she heard that the boroughs of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were desperately seeking to attract business, she made a deal with civic officials.

A former resident and architectural historian, Hans Egli, noted the vast range of styles: [[Federal architecture|Federalist]], [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]], [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]], [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]], and [[Richardsonian Romanesque]]. Most of these architectural examples remained protected and intact beneath [[aluminum siding|aluminum]] or [[vinyl siding]] that has since been removed. [[Denise Scott Brown]] and [[Robert Venturi]], renowned [[Philadelphia]] architects, conducted a little-known planning study in the 1970s that attempted to understand the dynamics of historicism and tourism, notions that have come into their own in contemporary times. While Venturi's planning study was unique at the time, it has since become a critical factor in Jim Thorpe's rebound as a functioning and economically stable community.<ref>''Out of the Ordinary: Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Associates'', Brownlee, David B. and Kathryn B.

This helped open up the area to commerce, and helped to fuel the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the United States. By the 1850s, the \"Gravity Road\" (as it became known) was providing rides to thrill seekers for 50 cents a ride (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.50|1855|r=2}}}} today). It is often cited as the first [[roller coaster]] in the United States.

The muddy bottom of that high tarn (the range then rivaling the Himalayas in size), where the waters pooled at a lower elevation amongst the twisted folds of four near-parallel ridgelines, created a level region whose settlements became the relatively flat lands on either bank of the Lehigh.

This town is also historically known as the burial site for the body of Native American sports legend [[Jim Thorpe]].\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\n[[File:Central Railroad of New Jersey Station, Jim Thorpe, PA 01.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Central Railroad of New Jersey Station (Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania)|Central Railroad of New Jersey Station]], now a visitors center]]\n'''Jim Thorpe''' was founded in 1818 as '''Mauch Chunk''' {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|m|\u0254\u02d0|k|_|\u02c8|t\u0283|\u028c|\u014b|k}}, a name derived from the term ''Mawsch Unk'' (Bear Place) in the language of the native Munsee-Lenape [[Lenape|Delaware peoples]]: possibly a reference to Bear Mountain, an extension of Mauch Chunk Ridge that resembled a sleeping bear, or perhaps the original profile of the ridge, which has since been changed heavily by 220 years of mining. The [[company town]] was founded by [[Josiah White]] and his two partners, founders of the [[Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company]] (LC&N). The town would be the lower terminus of a [[gravity railroad]], the [[#Mauch Chunk Switchback Gravity Railroad|Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad]], which would bring coal to the head of the LC&N [[Lehigh Canal]] for transshipment to the confluence of the [[Delaware River]], {{convert|43|km|1}} downstream at Easton. It would thereby ship LC&N's coal to [[Philadelphia]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New York City]], and other large cities in [[New Jersey]] and [[Delaware]], and by ocean to the whole [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Canal shipping was eventually replaced by railroad shipping.\n===Coal mining and the LC&N canal===\nThe town grew slowly in its first decade, then rapidly around 1818 grew larger as it became an anthracite [[coal]]-shipping center.  (The other large city with growing coal mining in the region was [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], with a population of over 140,000.) Mauch Chunk is on a Lehigh River west side (right bank) flat where Mahoning Creek enters and is a tributary of the [[Lehigh River]]. The river's left bank community of [[East Mauch Chunk]], which has more of the houses of modern Jim Thorpe, was settled later to support the short-lived Beaver Creek Railroad, the mines which spawned it, and the logging industry. It came into greater growth when the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] in 1885 pushed up the valley on the river's east bank to oppose LC&N's effective transportation monopoly over the region, which extended across to northwest Wilkes-Barre at [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]] on the [[Susquehanna River]]/[[Pennsylvania Canal]]. (See [[Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad]], a subsidiary of LC&N.)\n\n===Railroad growth and coal shipping===\nAfter the Pennsylvania Canal Commission smoothed the way, Lehigh Coal & Navigation built the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (L&S) from Pittston to Ashley, building the [[Ashley Planes]] [[inclined railway]] and linked that by rail from [[Mountain Top, Pennsylvania|Mountain Top]] to [[White Haven, Pennsylvania|White Haven]] at the head of the canal's upper works&mdash;referred to as the \"Grand Lehigh Canal\"&mdash;which navigations shortened the Lehigh Gorge (now located in the [[Lehigh Gorge State Park]]) route, cutting the distance from Philadelphia to Wilkes-Barre and the [[Wyoming Valley]] coal deposits by over {{convert|100|mi|-1}}. This placed Mauch Chunk in the center of a nexus of transportation in country tough to travel through. When floods wiped out many of the upper Lehigh Canal works in 1861, the L&S Railroad was extended through the gap to supplant the canal, and the so-called switchback-twisted backtrack through [[Avoca, Pennsylvania|Avoca]], with the improved engines of the day, enabled two-way steam locomotive traction and traffic despite the steep grades. Owner LC&N Company's headquarters was built across the street in Mauch Chunk from the L&S Railroad's stylish brick passenger station that was soon boarding passengers onto trains from New York and Philadelphia to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. The Central Railroad of New Jersey eventually took over the L&S and the station. The Lehigh Valley Railroad arrived on the river's east bank at East Mauch Chunk in 1855.,<ref>Jom Thorpe/Lehigh Valley Station wikipedia</ref>\n\n===Major historical events===\nMauch Chunk was the location of one of the trials of the [[Molly Maguires]] in 1876, which resulted in the [[hanging]] of four men found guilty of murder.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07E0D61E3FE73BBC4F51DFB566838D669FDE The Molly Maguires; Approaching Trial of the Murderers of John P.

The town's citizens had paid for her, a Thorpe son and Jim's body to be shipped from California, paid and arranged for the funeral service at St. Benedict's Catholic church, and paid for the mausoleum costs at Fairview Cemetery. Then Gov. Johnston Murray vetoed a bill which would contribute funds to the erection of the memorial at Athletic Park. On Sept. 1st Mrs. Thorpe, saying she feared Jim would be buried in a potter's field, shipped the body to Tulsa where she said the Chamber of Commerce was going to build a proper memorial, which was not true.<ref>{{cite news| last=Hagerty| first=James R.| title=Is There Life After Jim Thorpe for Jim Thorpe, Pa.?| newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| date=July 21, 2010| page=A14}}</ref> When she heard that the boroughs of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were desperately seeking to attract business, she made a deal with civic officials.

A former resident and architectural historian, Hans Egli, noted the vast range of styles: [[Federal architecture|Federalist]], [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]], [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]], [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]], and [[Richardsonian Romanesque]]. Most of these architectural examples remained protected and intact beneath [[aluminum siding|aluminum]] or [[vinyl siding]] that has since been removed. [[Denise Scott Brown]] and [[Robert Venturi]], renowned [[Philadelphia]] architects, conducted a little-known planning study in the 1970s that attempted to understand the dynamics of historicism and tourism, notions that have come into their own in contemporary times. While Venturi's planning study was unique at the time, it has since become a critical factor in Jim Thorpe's rebound as a functioning and economically stable community.<ref>''Out of the Ordinary: Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Associates'', Brownlee, David B. and Kathryn B. Hiesinger, published 2001, page 76</ref> Jim Thorpe tourism is based on its vintage architecture, and recreation such as hiking, [[paintball]] and [[white water rafting]].\n\n===Historic site preservation and modern day use===\nThe [[Lehigh Canal|Carbon County Section of the Lehigh Canal]], [[Old Mauch Chunk Historic District]], [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway]], [[Asa Packer Mansion]], [[Harry Packer Mansion]], [[Carbon County Jail]], [[Central Railroad of New Jersey Station (Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania)|Central Railroad of New Jersey Station]], and [[St. Mark's Episcopal Church (Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania)|St. Mark's Episcopal Church]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> The former Central Railroad of New Jersey railroad line through the Lehigh gorge and through Jim Thorpe is now operated as a summer tourist railroad by Reading Blue Mountain & Northern Railroad.

This helped open up the area to commerce, and helped to fuel the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the United States. By the 1850s, the \"Gravity Road\" (as it became known) was providing rides to thrill seekers for 50 cents a ride (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.50|1855|r=2}}}} today). It is often cited as the first [[roller coaster]] in the United States. The Switchback Gravity Railroad Foundation was formed to study the feasibility of preserving and interpreting the remains of the Switchback Gravity Railroad on top of Mount Pisgah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.switchbackgravityrr.org|title=The switchback Gravity Railroad|author=|date=|website=switchbackgravityrr.org}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:ThesisJimThorpeWiki.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Jim Thorpe lies in the shadow of Mount Pisgah at the end of [[Pisgah Mountain]] (Pisgah Ridge), upriver of the Lehigh Water Gap between [[Bear Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Bear Mountain]] on the east/left bank and the valley of Mauch Chunk Creek on the right bank.]]\nJim Thorpe is located near the center of [[Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Carbon County]] at {{Coord|40|52|23|N|75|44|11|W|type:city}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the deeps of the [[geologic timescale]] the two shorelines of the [[Lehigh River]] occupied by the 19th-century towns of Mauch Chunk and [[East Mauch Chunk]] were situated on the bottom of an ancient river-fed [[Tarn (lake)|tarn]], a mountain lake which filled the valley on the west bank and covered the relative flatlands on the east bank. The muddy bottom of that high tarn (the range then rivaling the Himalayas in size), where the waters pooled at a lower elevation amongst the twisted folds of four near-parallel ridgelines, created a level region whose settlements became the relatively flat lands on either bank of the Lehigh. The ridgelines, which run east-northeast to west-southwest, are (from north to south) Broad, Nesquehoning, Pisgah, and Mauch Chunk ridges (or Mountains)&mdash;each of which runs over {{convert|15|mi|km|1}} west to the gaps cut by the [[Schuylkill River]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough of Jim Thorpe has a total area of {{convert|38.6|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|37.8|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.8|km2|order=flip|1}}, or 2.15%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> Jim Thorpe is {{convert|3|mi|0}} north and upstream of [[Lehighton, Pennsylvania|Lehighton]], below the Lehigh Gap which sunders Bear Mountain on the east bank from the extended ridge of [[Mauch Chunk Mountain]].
