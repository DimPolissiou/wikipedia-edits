{"title_page": "Edward Mylius", "text_new": "'''Edward Mylius''' was a journalist jailed in 1911 for criminal [[libel]] for publishing a report that [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] was a bigamist.\n\n==Libel case==\nMylius alleged in a Paris-based Republican paper ''The Liberator'' in 1910 that George V had been already married to Mary, the daughter of Admiral [[Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, 3rd Baronet|Sir Michael Culme-Seymour]], while serving in Malta as a young man. This would have been not only scandalous but also illegal, contravening the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]].\n\nNormally royalty avoid suing over lies told about them, but in a break with precedent, the King decided that in this case, he had no choice. The rumours accused him of the crime of [[bigamy]], and questioned the legal status of the Queen and the [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]] of all their children. The King, with the advice of home secretary [[Winston Churchill]], issued proceedings against Mylius for criminal libel and said he was prepared to go into the box to disprove the allegations. [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Sir Rufus Isaacs]], the attorney-general, advised the king that it would be unconstitutional for him to give evidence in his own court.\n\nMylius was arrested for criminal libel and tried before the [[Lord Chief Justice of England]] and a jury. [[Richard David Muir|Sir Richard David Muir]], prosecuting, showed that the claims about the King were a complete fiction. It was shown\n* that he had not even been in Malta in 1890 when the supposed marriage took place;\n* that the admiral whose daughter he had supposedly married had two daughters, of whom:\n** one had never met the King;\n** and the other had met him only twice: once when she was eight years old and once when both he and she were already married.\n\nMylius was convicted and jailed for 12 months.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/monarchy/2015428.stm BBC News website.]</ref>\n\nThe King recorded his feelings on the affair in his diary. \n:''The whole story is a damnable lie and has been in existence now for over twenty years. I trust that this will settle it once and for all.''<ref>Harold Nicolson, ''King George V'' (Pan, 1967) p.200.</ref>\nHis mother, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]], wrote to him\n:''Thank God that vile trial is over and those infamous lies and foul accusations at an end for ever and cleared up before the whole world. To us it was a ridiculous story your having been married before&nbsp;...! Too silly for words&nbsp;... My poor Georgie - really it was too bad and must have worried you all the same.<ref>Nicolson, p.201.</ref>\n\nAfter Mylius was released from prison, he went to live in the US.

This would have been not only scandalous but also illegal, contravening the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]].\n\nNormally royalty avoid suing over lies told about them, but in a break with precedent, the King decided that in this case, he had no choice. The rumours accused him of the crime of [[bigamy]], and questioned the legal status of the Queen and the [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]] of all their children. The King, with the advice of home secretary [[Winston Churchill]], issued proceedings against Mylius for criminal libel and said he was prepared to go into the box to disprove the allegations. [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Sir Rufus Isaacs]], the attorney-general, advised the king that it would be unconstitutional for him to give evidence in his own court.\n\nMylius was arrested for criminal libel and tried before the [[Lord Chief Justice of England]] and a jury. [[Richard David Muir|Sir Richard David Muir]], prosecuting, showed that the claims about the King were a complete fiction. It was shown\n* that he had not even been in Malta in 1890 when the supposed marriage took place;\n* that the admiral whose daughter he had supposedly married had two daughters, of whom:\n** one had never met the King;\n** and the other had met him only twice: once when she was eight years old and once when both he and she were already married.\n\nMylius was convicted and jailed for 12 months.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/monarchy/2015428.stm BBC News website.]</ref>\n\nThe King recorded his feelings on the affair in his diary. \n:''The whole story is a damnable lie and has been in existence now for over twenty years. I trust that this will settle it once and for all.''<ref>Harold Nicolson, ''King George V'' (Pan, 1967) p.200.</ref>\nHis mother, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]], wrote to him\n:''Thank God that vile trial is over and those infamous lies and foul accusations at an end for ever and cleared up before the whole world.

The former belief, which arose in the 1800s, was that the original Moriori migrated directly from the more northerly Polynesian islands, just as with the settlement of New Zealand by the ancestors of the M\u0101ori. However, linguistic research indicates instead that the ancestral Moriori were M\u0101ori wanderers from New Zealand.<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark 1994: 123\u2013135.</ref><ref name=\"Davis\">Davis and Solomon 2006</ref><ref name=\"Howe2006\">Howe 2006</ref><ref name=\"King\">King 2000</ref>\nHowe (2003) states:\n<blockquote>Scholarship over the past 40 years has radically revised the model offered a century earlier by Smith: the Moriori as a pre-Polynesian people have gone (the term Moriori is now a technical term referring to those ancestral M\u0101ori who settled the Chatham Islands).'<ref name=\"Howe2003\">Kerry R. Howe (2003). ''The Quest for Origins: Who First Discovered and Settled New Zealand and the Pacific Islands?''

While their new environment deprived them of the resources with which to build ocean-going craft for long voyages, the Moriori invented what was known as the ''waka k\u014drari'', a semi-submerged craft, constructed of flax and lined with air bladders from kelp. This craft was used to travel to the outer islands on 'birding' missions.<ref name=\"King\" /> The Moriori society was a peaceful society and bloodshed was outlawed by the chief Nunuku after generations of warfare. Arguments were solved by consensus or by [[duel]]s rather than warfare, but at the first sign of bloodshed, the  fight was over. It has been estimated that the population was about 2,000 prior to European contact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/chatham-islands/print|title=Chatham Islands|website=teara.govt.nz|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\n===European arrival===\nThe name \"Chatham Islands\" comes from the ship {{HMS|Chatham|1788|6}}<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chatham Islands|volume=6|pages=6\u20137}}</ref> of the [[Vancouver Expedition]], whose captain [[William R. Broughton]] landed on 29 November 1791, claimed possession for Great Britain and named the islands after the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham]]. A relative of his, [[Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford|Thomas Pitt]], was a member of the Vancouver Expedition. [[Seal hunting|Sealers]] and [[whaling|whalers]] soon started hunting in the surrounding ocean with the islands as their base. It is estimated that 10 to 20 percent of the indigenous Moriori soon died from diseases introduced by foreigners. The sealing and whaling industries ceased activities about 1861, while fishing remained as a major economic activity.\n\nChatham Islands date their anniversary on 29 November, and observe it 30 November.\n\n===M\u0101ori settlement===\nOn 19 November and 5 December 1835, about 900 Ng\u0101ti Mutunga and Ng\u0101ti Tama previously resident in Te Whanganui-A-Tara (Wellington) and led by the chief Matioro arrived on the brig ''Lord Rodney''. The first mate of the ship had been 'kidnapped and threatened with death' unless the captain took the M\u0101ori settlers on board. The group, which included men, women and children, brought with them 78 tonnes of seed potato, 20 pigs and seven large canoes called ''[[waka (canoe)|waka]]''.<ref name=\"being_Pakeha\">King, M. (2004). ''Being Pakeha''. Penguin. p 196.</ref>\n\nThe incoming M\u0101ori were received and initially cared for by the local [[Moriori]].  Soon, Ng\u0101ti Mutunga and Ng\u0101ti Tama began to ''takahi'', or walk the land, to lay claim to it. When it became clear that the visitors intended to stay, the Moriori withdrew to their [[marae]] at te Awapatiki. There, after holding a ''hui'' (consultation) to debate what to do about the M\u0101ori settlers, the Moriori decided to keep with their policy of non-aggression.\n\nNg\u0101ti Mutunga and Ng\u0101ti Tama in turn saw the meeting as a precursor to warfare on the part of Moriori and responded. The M\u0101ori attacked and in the ensuing action killed over 260 Moriori. A Moriori survivor recalled: \"[The M\u0101ori] commenced to kill us like sheep... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 indiscriminately.\" A M\u0101ori chief, Te Rakatau Katihe, said: \"We took possession ... in accordance with our custom, and we caught all the people. Not one escaped. Some ran away from us, these we killed; and others also we killed \u2014 but what of that? It was in accordance with our custom.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Despite the Chatham Islands being made part of New Zealand in 1842, M\u0101ori kept Moriori slaves until 1863.\n\nAfter the killings, Moriori were forbidden to marry Moriori, or to have children with each other. All became slaves of the M\u0101ori until the 1860s.<ref>''Rekohu''{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> Many died in despair. Many Moriori women had children by their M\u0101ori masters. A number of Moriori women eventually married either M\u0101ori or European men. Some were taken away from the Chathams and never returned. [[Ernst Dieffenbach]], who visited the Chathams on a [[New Zealand Company]] ship in 1840, reported that the Moriori were the virtual slaves of M\u0101ori and were severely mistreated, with death being a blessing. By the time the slaves were released in 1862, only 160 remained, hardly 10% of the 1835 population.<ref name=\"being_Pakeha\"/>\n\nIn early May 1838 (some reports say 1839 but this is contradicted by ship records<ref name=\"whaling-days\">{{cite book |title=The Old Whaling Days |chapter-url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-McNOldW-t1-body-d1-d19-d1.html |chapter=XIX. \u2014 American Whalers and Scientists, 1838 to 1840|website=Victoria University of Wellington |first=Robert |last=McNab |year=1913|accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref>) the French whaling vessel ''Jean Bart'' anchored off Waitangi to trade with the M\u0101ori. The number of M\u0101ori boarding frightened the French, escalating into a confrontation in which the French crew were killed and the ''Jean Bart'' was run aground at Ocean Bay, to be ransacked and burned by Ng\u0101ti Mutunga. When word of the incident reached the French naval corvette ''Heroine'' in the Bay of Islands in September 1838, it set sail for the Chathams, accompanied by the whalers ''Adele'' and ''Rebecca Sims''. The French arrived on 13 October and, after unsuccessfully attempting to entice some Ng\u0101ti Tama aboard, proceeded to bombard Waitangi. The next morning about a hundred armed Frenchmen went ashore, burning buildings, destroying ''waka'', and seizing pigs and potatoes.

They built a high staging next to the ''pa'' so they could fire down on their former allies. Fighting was still in progress when the New Zealand Company ship ''[[New Zealand Company ships#Cuba|Cuba]]'' arrived as part of a scheme to buy land for settlement. The [[Treaty of Waitangi]], at that stage, did not apply to the islands. The company negotiated a truce between the two warring tribes. In 1841, the New Zealand Company had proposed to establish a German colony on the Chathams. The proposal was discussed by the directors and John Ward signed an agreement with [[Karl Sieveking]] of [[Hamburg]] on 12 September 1841. However, when the Colonial Office said that the islands were to be part of the colony of New Zealand and any Germans settling there would be treated as aliens, Joseph Somes claimed that Ward had been acting on his own initiative. The proposed leader John Beit and the expedition went to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] instead.<ref>{{cite book | author=Patricia Burns | title=Fatal Success: A History of the New Zealand Company | year= 1989 | pages=243, 244 |isbn=978-0-7900-0011-4 | publisher= Heinemann Reed }}</ref>\n\nThe company was then able to purchase large areas of land at Port Hutt (which the M\u0101ori called Whangaroa) and [[Waitangi, Chatham Islands|Waitangi]] from Ng\u0101ti Mutunga and also large areas of land from Ng\u0101ti Tama. This did not stop Ng\u0101ti Mutunga from trying to get revenge for the death of one of their chiefs. They were satisfied after they killed the brother of a Ng\u0101ti Tama chief.

The rebel prisoners were paid one shilling a day to work on sheep farms owned by the few European settlers. Sometimes they worked on road and track improvements. They were initially guarded by 26 guards, half of whom were M\u0101ori. They lived in ''[[whare]]'' along with their families. The prisoners helped build a redoubt of stone surrounded by a ditch and wall. Later, they built three stone prison cells. In 1868 Te Kooti and the other prisoners commandeered a schooner and escaped back to the North Island.\n\nAlmost all the M\u0101ori returned to Taranaki in the 1860s, some after a tsunami in 1868.<ref name=Ara_4/>\n\n=== 1880s to today ===\nThe economy of the Chatham Islands, then dominated by the export of wool, suffered under the [[Long Depression|international depression]] of the 1880s, only rebounding with the building of fish freezing plants at the island villages of \u014cwenga and Kaingaroa in 1910. Construction of the first wharf at Waitangi began in 1931 with completion in 1934. On 25 November 1940, during the Second World War, a German raider captured and then sank the Chatham Islands supply ship, the Holmwood, so the wharf saw little use by ships.

With the withdrawal of TEAL, the RNZAF maintained an infrequent service with [[Short Sunderland]] flying boats. NZ4111 was damaged on takeoff from Te Whanga Lagoon on 4 November 1959 and remains as a wreck on the island. The last flight by RNZAF flying boats was on 22 March 1967.<ref>{{cite web|last=www.seawings.co.uk|first=flying boat forum|title=Short flying boats in New Zealand|url=http://theflyingboatforum.forumlaunch.net/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=985&start=50|accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref> For many years [[Bristol Freighter]] aircraft served the islands, a slow and noisy freight aircraft converted for carrying passengers by installing a removable passenger compartment equipped with [[airline seat]]s and a toilet in part of the cargo hold. The air service primarily served to ship out high-value export [[crayfish]] products.\n\nThe grass landing field at Hapupu, at the northern end of the Island, proved a limiting factor, as few aircraft apart from the Bristol Freighter had both the range to fly to the islands and the ruggedness to land on the grass airstrip. Although other aircraft did use the landing field occasionally, they would often require repairs to fix damage resulting from the rough landing. Hapupu is also the site of the [[JM Barker (Hapupu) Historic Reserve|JM Barker (Hapupu) National Historic Reserve]] (one of only two in New Zealand) where there are momori rakau (Moriori tree carvings).\n\nIn 1981, after many years of requests by locals and the imminent demise of the ageing Bristol Freighters, the construction of a sealed runway at Karewa, [[Tuuta Airport]], allowed more modern aircraft to land safely. The Chathams' own airline, [[Air Chathams]], now operates services to Auckland on Thursdays, Wellington on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and Christchurch on Tuesdays. The timetable varies seasonally, but generally planes depart the Chathams around 10.30&nbsp;am (Chathams Time) and arrive in the mainland around noon. There they refuel and reload, and depart again at around 1&nbsp;pm back to the Chathams. Air Chathams operates twin turboprop [[Convair 580#Variants|Convair 580]] aircraft in combi (freight and passenger) configurations and [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner|Fairchild Metroliners]].\n\nThe ship ''Rangatira'' provided a freight service from [[Timaru]] to the Chatham Islands from March 2000 to August 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=The good ship Rangatira |first=Fergus |last=Blakiston |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/life/71498342/The-good-ship-Rangatira |newspaper=The Timaru Herald |date=29 August 2015 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> The MV ''Southern Tiare'' provides a freight service between [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], Timaru and the Chathams.<ref name=CISL/>\n\nThere is a small section of tar sealed road between Waitangi and Te One, but the majority of the islands' roads are gravel.\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Flag of Chatham Islands.svg|right|thumb|[[Flag of the Chatham Islands|Chatham Islands Flag]] (unofficial, but widely used on the Islands)]]\n\n===Electorates===\nUntil the 1990s, the Chatham Islands were in the [[Lyttelton (New Zealand electorate)|Lyttelton]] electorate, but since then they have formed part of the [[Rongotai (New Zealand electorate)|Rongotai]] general electorate, which otherwise lies in south [[Wellington]]. [[Paul Eagle]] is the MP for Rongotai. The [[Te Tai Tonga]] [[M\u0101ori electorates|M\u0101ori electorate]] (held since 2011 by [[Rino Tirikatene]]) includes the Chatham Islands; before the seats were reformed in 1996 the archipelago was part of [[Western Maori]].\n\n===Local government===\nFor local government purposes, the Chatham Islands and the adjoining sea is known as the Chatham Islands Territory and is administered by the Chatham Islands Council, which was established by the Chatham Islands Council Act 1995 (Statute No 041, Commenced: 1 November 1995).<ref name=CIC_Act>{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1995/0041/latest/DLM367666.html |title=Chatham Islands Council Act 1995 |work=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=New Zealand Government |accessdate=21 January 2020}}</ref> The Council is a [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authority]] that has many of the functions, duties and powers of a [[Districts of New Zealand|district council]] and of a [[Regions of New Zealand|regional council]],<ref name=CIC_Act/> making it in effect a [[unitary authority]] with slightly fewer responsibilities than other unitary authorities. The Council comprises a Mayor and eight Councillors, one of whom is also Deputy Mayor.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cic.govt.nz/your-council/ | title=Your Council \u00bb Chatham Islands Council}}</ref> Certain regional council functions are being administered by [[Environment Canterbury]], the Canterbury Regional Council.\n\nIn the 2010 local government elections, Chatham Islands had New Zealand's highest rate of returned votes, with 71.3 per cent voting.<ref>''New Zealand Herald'', 15 October 2010</ref>\n\n===State services===\n[[New Zealand Police|Policing]] is carried out by a sole-charge [[constable]] appointed by the [[Wellington]] police district, who has often doubled as an official for many [[State sector organisations in New Zealand|government departments]], including court registrar (Department for Courts), customs officer (New Zealand Customs Service) and immigration officer (Department of Labour \u2013 New Zealand Immigration Service).\n\nA District Court judge sent from either the [[North Island]] or the [[South Island]] presides over court sittings, but urgent sittings may take place at the Wellington District Court.\n\nBecause of the isolation and small population, some of the rules governing daily activities undergo a certain relaxation. For example, every transport service operated solely on [[Great Barrier Island]], the Chatham Islands or [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]] need not comply with section 70C of the Transport Act 1962 (the requirements for drivers to maintain driving-hours logbooks). Drivers subject to section 70B must nevertheless keep record of their driving hours in some form.<ref>''[[New Zealand Gazette]]'' 14 August 2003</ref>\n\n===Health===\nThe Canterbury District Health Board is responsible for providing publicly funded health services for the island.

Pitt Island and Kaingaroa are staffed by sole charge principals, while Te One has three teachers and a principal. The schools cater for children from year 1 to 8. There is no secondary school. The majority of secondary school-aged students leave the island for boarding schools in mainland New Zealand. A small number remain on the island and obtain their secondary education by correspondence.\n\n==Economy==\nMost of the Chatham Island economy is based on fishing and crayfishing, with only a fragment of the economic activity in adventure tourism. This economic mix has been stable for the past 50 years, as little infrastructure or population is present to engage in higher levels of industrial or telecommunications activity.<ref>See, for example, page 2 of the Chatham Islands Council 2015-2016 Annual Report, http://www.cic.govt.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Chatham_Islands_Annual_Report_2015-16_Web_Version.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316204121/http://www.cic.govt.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Chatham_Islands_Annual_Report_2015-16_Web_Version.pdf |date=16 March 2017 }}</ref>\n\n[[Air Chathams]] has its head office in Te One.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airchathams.co.nz/contact-us.html |title=Contact Us |publisher=Airchathams.co.nz |accessdate=2015-08-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909224526/http://www.airchathams.co.nz/contact-us.html |archivedate=9 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Electricity generation===\nTwo 225-kW wind turbines and diesel generators provide power on Chatham island, at costs of five to ten times that of electricity on the main islands of New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windenergy.org.nz/chatham-islands-wind-farm|title=Chatham Islands Wind Farm|publisher=New Zealand Wind Energy Association|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>  During 2014, 65% of the electricity was generated from diesel generators, the balance from wind.<ref>See the 2013-14 Chatham Islands Electricity Ltd Annual Report on page 6 of this document https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1OcswQ6_z-OSmVwTDNBdGEycTA/edit</ref> For heating, electricity comes second to wood and, in 2013, solar power contributed about a third as much as mains generated electricity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://figure.nz/chart/CxnUWptZTfwKYwJz|title=Fuel types used for heating in the Chatham Islands Territory, New Zealand|website=Figure.NZ|language=en-nz|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Telecommunications ===\nA 1.5kW wireless link<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19170317.2.67|title=A LONELY OUTPOST - EVENING POST|last=|first=|date=17 Mar 1917|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> opened in 1913,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19130919.2.58|title=WIRELESS STATION OPENED AT THE CHATHAMS.

The former belief, which arose in the 1800s, was that the original Moriori migrated directly from the more northerly Polynesian islands, just as with the settlement of New Zealand by the ancestors of the M\u0101ori. However, linguistic research indicates instead that the ancestral Moriori were M\u0101ori wanderers from New Zealand.<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark 1994: 123\u2013135.</ref><ref name=\"Davis\">Davis and Solomon 2006</ref><ref name=\"Howe2006\">Howe 2006</ref><ref name=\"King\">King 2000</ref>\nHowe (2003) states:\n<blockquote>Scholarship over the past 40 years has radically revised the model offered a century earlier by Smith: the Moriori as a pre-Polynesian people have gone (the term Moriori is now a technical term referring to those ancestral M\u0101ori who settled the Chatham Islands).'<ref name=\"Howe2003\">Kerry R.

While their new environment deprived them of the resources with which to build ocean-going craft for long voyages, the Moriori invented what was known as the ''waka k\u014drari'', a semi-submerged craft, constructed of flax and lined with air bladders from kelp. This craft was used to travel to the outer islands on 'birding' missions.<ref name=\"King\" /> The Moriori society was a peaceful society and bloodshed was outlawed by the chief Nunuku after generations of warfare. Arguments were solved by consensus or by [[duel]]s rather than warfare, but at the first sign of bloodshed, the  fight was over.

A relative of his, [[Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford|Thomas Pitt]], was a member of the Vancouver Expedition. [[Seal hunting|Sealers]] and [[whaling|whalers]] soon started hunting in the surrounding ocean with the islands as their base.

The first mate of the ship had been 'kidnapped and threatened with death' unless the captain took the M\u0101ori settlers on board. The group, which included men, women and children, brought with them 78 tonnes of seed potato, 20 pigs and seven large canoes called ''[[waka (canoe)|waka]]''.<ref name=\"being_Pakeha\">King, M.

Soon, Ng\u0101ti Mutunga and Ng\u0101ti Tama began to ''takahi'', or walk the land, to lay claim to it. When it became clear that the visitors intended to stay, the Moriori withdrew to their [[marae]] at te Awapatiki. There, after holding a ''hui'' (consultation) to debate what to do about the M\u0101ori settlers, the Moriori decided to keep with their policy of non-aggression.\n\nNg\u0101ti Mutunga and Ng\u0101ti Tama in turn saw the meeting as a precursor to warfare on the part of Moriori and responded. The M\u0101ori attacked and in the ensuing action killed over 260 Moriori. A Moriori survivor recalled: \"[The M\u0101ori] commenced to kill us like sheep... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 indiscriminately.\" A M\u0101ori chief, Te Rakatau Katihe, said: \"We took possession ... in accordance with our custom, and we caught all the people. Not one escaped. Some ran away from us, these we killed; and others also we killed \u2014 but what of that? It was in accordance with our custom.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Despite the Chatham Islands being made part of New Zealand in 1842, M\u0101ori kept Moriori slaves until 1863.\n\nAfter the killings, Moriori were forbidden to marry Moriori, or to have children with each other. All became slaves of the M\u0101ori until the 1860s.<ref>''Rekohu''{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> Many died in despair. Many Moriori women had children by their M\u0101ori masters. A number of Moriori women eventually married either M\u0101ori or European men. Some were taken away from the Chathams and never returned. [[Ernst Dieffenbach]], who visited the Chathams on a [[New Zealand Company]] ship in 1840, reported that the Moriori were the virtual slaves of M\u0101ori and were severely mistreated, with death being a blessing. By the time the slaves were released in 1862, only 160 remained, hardly 10% of the 1835 population.<ref name=\"being_Pakeha\"/>\n\nIn early May 1838 (some reports say 1839 but this is contradicted by ship records<ref name=\"whaling-days\">{{cite book |title=The Old Whaling Days |chapter-url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-McNOldW-t1-body-d1-d19-d1.html |chapter=XIX. \u2014 American Whalers and Scientists, 1838 to 1840|website=Victoria University of Wellington |first=Robert |last=McNab |year=1913|accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref>) the French whaling vessel ''Jean Bart'' anchored off Waitangi to trade with the M\u0101ori.

Fighting was still in progress when the New Zealand Company ship ''[[New Zealand Company ships#Cuba|Cuba]]'' arrived as part of a scheme to buy land for settlement. The [[Treaty of Waitangi]], at that stage, did not apply to the islands. The company negotiated a truce between the two warring tribes. In 1841, the New Zealand Company had proposed to establish a German colony on the Chathams. The proposal was discussed by the directors and John Ward signed an agreement with [[Karl Sieveking]] of [[Hamburg]] on 12 September 1841. However, when the Colonial Office said that the islands were to be part of the colony of New Zealand and any Germans settling there would be treated as aliens, Joseph Somes claimed that Ward had been acting on his own initiative. The proposed leader John Beit and the expedition went to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] instead.<ref>{{cite book | author=Patricia Burns | title=Fatal Success: A History of the New Zealand Company | year= 1989 | pages=243, 244 |isbn=978-0-7900-0011-4 | publisher= Heinemann Reed }}</ref>\n\nThe company was then able to purchase large areas of land at Port Hutt (which the M\u0101ori called Whangaroa) and [[Waitangi, Chatham Islands|Waitangi]] from Ng\u0101ti Mutunga and also large areas of land from Ng\u0101ti Tama. This did not stop Ng\u0101ti Mutunga from trying to get revenge for the death of one of their chiefs. They were satisfied after they killed the brother of a Ng\u0101ti Tama chief.

Construction of the first wharf at Waitangi began in 1931 with completion in 1934. On 25 November 1940, during the Second World War, a German raider captured and then sank the Chatham Islands supply ship, the Holmwood, so the wharf saw little use by ships.

The air service primarily served to ship out high-value export [[crayfish]] products.\n\nThe grass landing field at Hapupu, at the northern end of the Island, proved a limiting factor, as few aircraft apart from the Bristol Freighter had both the range to fly to the islands and the ruggedness to land on the grass airstrip. Although other aircraft did use the landing field occasionally, they would often require repairs to fix damage resulting from the rough landing. Hapupu is also the site of the [[JM Barker (Hapupu) Historic Reserve|JM Barker (Hapupu) National Historic Reserve]] (one of only two in New Zealand) where there are momori rakau (Moriori tree carvings).\n\nIn 1981, after many years of requests by locals and the imminent demise of the ageing Bristol Freighters, the construction of a sealed runway at Karewa, [[Tuuta Airport]], allowed more modern aircraft to land safely. The Chathams' own airline, [[Air Chathams]], now operates services to Auckland on Thursdays, Wellington on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and Christchurch on Tuesdays. The timetable varies seasonally, but generally planes depart the Chathams around 10.30&nbsp;am (Chathams Time) and arrive in the mainland around noon.
