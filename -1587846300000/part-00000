As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

Brandin (ed.), ''The History of Fulk Fitz-Warine'' (Alexander Moring Ltd., De La More Press, London 1904), p. xii.</ref> The castle thereafter descended in the [[Baron FitzWarin|FitzWarin family]], all subsequent holders bearing the first-name Fulk, until the death of [[Fulk XI FitzWarin, 7th Baron FitzWarin]] (1405\u20131420) in 1420.<ref>Painter, ''The Reign of King John'', pp. 51\u201352</ref>\n\nThe high regard in which Fulk III was held by many of the king's barons in 1207 is shown by the names of the men who stood surety for the fine of 1,200 marks demanded of him to marry [[Maud le Vavasour|Maud (Matilda)]], the heiress daughter of Robert le Vavasour and relict of [[Theobald Walter, 1st Chief Butler of Ireland|Theobald Walter]]. The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)]], a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', p. 39</ref> On 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.<ref>Painter, ''The Reign of King John'', pp. 280, 294.</ref>\n\n===Later confrontations===\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before the accession of the infant king [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (John's son) in 1216, Fulk's manor of Alveston had already been seized by the crown: in the following year (1217) all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218, however, Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered to be restored to him by the king's regents.<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', pp. 41, 43</ref> By 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington.<ref>T.D.

Fulk regained it the following year, although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized. By 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', pp. 41-42</ref><ref>I.J.

As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>G.E.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

{"title_page": "List of home video game consoles", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{VG history|expandmenu=2}}\n\nThis is a '''list of home video game consoles''' in chronological order, which includes all known [[home video game console]]s after the first generation, from the first console, [[Magnavox Odyssey]], to the first ever [[ROM cartridge]]-based console [[Fairchild Channel F]], ranging from the major video game companies such as [[Magnavox]], [[Atari]], [[Fairchild Camera and Instrument|Fairchild]], [[Intellivision|Intellivision Entertainment]], [[Coleco]], [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]], [[NEC]], [[The 3DO Company|3DO]], [[SNK]], [[Sony]], and [[Microsoft]] to modern market consoles.\n\nThis list is divided into eras which are named based on the dominant console type of the era, though not all consoles of those eras are of the same type. Some eras are referred to based on how many bits a major console could process. The \"128-bit era\" ([[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]]) was the final era in which this practice was widespread.\n\nThis list does not include other types of [[video game console]]s such as [[handheld game console]]s, which are usually of lower computational power than [[home console]]s due to their smaller size, [[microconsoles]], which are usually low-cost Android-based devices that rely on downloading, or [[dedicated console]]s past the first generation, which have games built in and do not use any form of physical media. Consoles have been redesigned from time to time to improve their market appeal. Redesigned models are not listed on their own.\n\n== Map key ==\nThere are a total of '''{{#expr:{{table row counter|id=2gencon|ignore=2}}+{{table row counter|id=3gencon|ignore=3}}+{{table row counter|id=4gencon|ignore=5}}+{{table row counter|id=5gencon|ignore=1}}+{{table row counter|id=6gencon|ignore=3}}+{{table row counter|id=7gencon|ignore=2}}+{{table row counter|id=8gencon|ignore=1}}}}''' video game platforms released since the second generation, and '''10''' canceled platforms.\n\nThis list only counts the first iteration of each console's hardware, because several systems have had slim, enhanced or other hardware revisions, but they aren't individually listed here. The list also includes unreleased systems. If a series of home video game consoles begins in a generation and lasts to another generation, it is listed in the generation the series began.

Some eras are referred to based on how many bits a major console could process. The \"128-bit era\" ([[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]]) was the final era in which this practice was widespread.\n\nThis list does not include other types of [[video game console]]s such as [[handheld game console]]s, which are usually of lower computational power than [[home console]]s due to their smaller size, [[microconsoles]], which are usually low-cost Android-based devices that rely on downloading, or [[dedicated console]]s past the first generation, which have games built in and do not use any form of physical media. Consoles have been redesigned from time to time to improve their market appeal.

[[Barbara Bach]] and [[Curd J\u00fcrgens]] co-star. It was directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]] and the screenplay was written by [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] and [[Richard Maibaum]].\n\nThe film takes its title from [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', the tenth book in the [[List of James Bond novels and stories|James Bond series]], though it does not contain any elements of the novel's plot. The storyline involves a reclusive megalomaniac named Karl Stromberg, who plans to destroy the world and create a new civilisation under the sea. Bond teams up with a [[Soviet Union|Russian]] agent, [[Anya Amasova]], to stop the plans, all while being hunted by Stromberg\u2019s powerful henchman, [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]].\n\nIt was shot on location in [[Egypt]] ([[Cairo]] and [[Luxor]]) and [[Italy]] ([[Costa Smeralda]], [[Sardinia]]), with underwater scenes filmed at [[the Bahamas]] ([[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]), and a [[007 Stage|new soundstage]] built at [[Pinewood Studios]] for a massive set which depicted the interior of a [[supertanker]]. ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' was well-received by critics, who saw the film as a return to form for the franchise. The soundtrack composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] also met with success. The film was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] amid many other nominations and novelised in 1977 by Christopher Wood as ''[[James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Royal Navy|British]] and a [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]] [[Ballistic Missile Submarine|ballistic-missile submarine]] suddenly disappear. James Bond \u2014 [[MI6]] agent 007 \u2014 is summoned to investigate. On the way to his briefing, Bond escapes an ambush by a squad of Soviet agents in [[Austria]], killing one during a downhill ski chase and evading the others. The plans for a highly advanced submarine tracking system are being offered in [[Egypt]]. There, Bond encounters Major Anya Amasova\u2014[[KGB]] agent Triple X\u2014his rival to recover the [[microfilm]] plans. They travel across Egypt together, encountering [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]] \u2013 a tall assassin with razor-sharp steel teeth \u2013 along the way. Bond and Amasova reluctantly join forces after a truce is agreed by their respective British and Soviet superiors. They identify the person responsible for the thefts as the shipping tycoon and scientist Karl Stromberg.\n\nWhile travelling by train to Stromberg's base in [[Sardinia]], Bond saves Amasova from Jaws, and their cooling rivalry turns to affection. Posing as a [[oceanography|marine biologist]] and his wife, they visit Stromberg's base and discover that he has launched a mysterious new supertanker, the ''Liparus'', nine months previously. As they leave the base, a henchman on a motorcycle featuring a rocket sidecar, Jaws in a car, and Naomi, an assistant/pilot of Stromberg in an attack helicopter, chase them, but Bond and Amasova escape underwater when his car \u2013 a [[Lotus Esprit]] from [[Q Branch]] \u2013 converts into a submarine. Jaws survives a car crash and Naomi is killed when Bond fires a sea-air missile from his car which destroys her helicopter. While examining Stromberg's underwater ''Atlantis'' base, the pair confirm that he is operating the stolen tracking system and encounter a fleet of Stromberg's minisubs which Amasova obliterates by launching mines. Bond finds out that the ''Liparus'' has never visited any known port or harbour. Amasova discovers that Bond killed her lover Sergei Barsov (as shown at the beginning of the movie), and she vows to kill Bond as soon as their mission is complete.\n\n[[File:Strongberglair.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Stromberg's hideout, ''Atlantis''.]]\n\nBond and Amasova board an [[SSN (hull classification symbol)|American submarine]] to examine the ''Liparus'' as it captures the submarine. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: the simultaneous launching of nuclear missiles from the captured British and Soviet submarines to obliterate Moscow and New York City. This would trigger a global nuclear war, which Stromberg would survive in ''Atlantis'', and subsequently a new civilization would be established underwater. He leaves for ''Atlantis'' with Amasova. Bond escapes and frees the captured British, Russian, and American sailors and they battle the ''Liparus''{{'}}s crew, but the joint U.S., U.K., and U.S.S.R. submariner coalition suffers heavy casualties just taking back the sub pen before managing to breach the control room, only to learn from the dying captain of the ''Liparus'' that the commandeered British and Soviet submarines are primed to fire their nukes in only a few minutes to ignite [[World War III]]. Bond reprograms the submarines to fire the nukes at each other, saving Moscow and New York City while destroying the subs and Stromberg's crews on both of them in the resulting [[nuclear explosion]]s. The victorious submariners escape the sinking ''Liparus'' on the American submarine.\n\nThe submarine is ordered by the Pentagon to destroy ''Atlantis'' but Bond insists on rescuing Amasova first. He confronts and kills Stromberg but again encounters Jaws, whom he drops into a shark tank. However, Jaws kills the shark and escapes. Bond and Amasova flee in an [[escape pod]] as ''Atlantis'' is sunk by torpedoes. Amasova picks up Bond's gun and points it at him, but then chooses not to kill him and the two embrace. The Royal Navy recovers the pod and the two spies are seen in an intimate embrace through its port window, much to the bemusement of their superiors on the ship.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BondAndJaws.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Roger Moore as Bond fighting Richard Kiel as Jaws inside ''Atlantis.'']] -->\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] 007: A British MI6 agent assigned to investigate the theft of two submarines.\n* [[Barbara Bach]] as [[Anya Amasova]]/Agent Triple X: A Soviet [[KGB]] agent also investigating the theft.

Saltzman had branched out into several other ventures of dubious promise and consequently was struggling through personal financial reversals unrelated to Bond. This was exacerbated by the twin personal tragedies of his wife's terminal cancer and many of the symptoms of clinical depression in himself.<ref>{{cite video | people = | title = Harry Saltzman, Showman | medium = Television documentary | publisher = MGM | accessdate = 5 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nAnother troubling aspect of the production was the difficulty in obtaining a director. The producers approached [[Steven Spielberg]], who was in post-production for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', but ultimately decided against him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/i-spy-25-fascinating-bond-facts-1-5097132|title=I spy...25 fascinating Bond facts|date=6 November 2012|website=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|website=[[The Independent]]|title=Steven Spielberg reveals he was rejected as Bond director twice|first=Jacob|last=Stolworthy|date=18 July 2016|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/steven-spielberg-james-bond-the-bfg-moonraker-broccoli-007-jaws-close-encounters-a7142731.html}}</ref> The first director attached to the film was [[Guy Hamilton]], who directed the previous three Bond films as well as ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', but he left after being offered the opportunity to direct the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', although [[Richard Donner]] took over the project.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The complete James Bond movie encyclopedia|first=Steven Jay |last=Rubin|publisher=Contemporary Books|year=2003|isbn=978-0-07-141246-9|page=392}}</ref> Eon Productions later turned to [[Lewis Gilbert]], who had directed the earlier Bond film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''.\n\nWith a director finally secured, the next hurdle was finishing the script, which had gone through several revisions by numerous writers. The initial villain of the film was [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]; however [[Kevin McClory]], who owned the film rights to ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' obtained an [[injunction]] barring Eon Productions from using the character of Blofeld, or his international criminal organisation, [[SPECTRE]], which delayed production of the film further. The villain was later changed from Blofeld to Stromberg so that the injunction would not interfere with the production. [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] was later brought in by Gilbert to complete the script. Although Fleming had requested that no elements from his original book be used, the film characters of [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]] and Sandor are based on the novel characters Sol Horror and Sluggsy Morant, respectively. Horror is described as having steel-capped teeth, while Sluggsy had a clear bald head.\n\nSince [[Ian Fleming]] permitted Eon to use only the name of his novel but not the actual plot,<ref name=Aldis-2020/> Fleming's name was moved for the first time from above the film's title to above \"James Bond 007\". His name reverted to the traditional location for ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', the last Eon Bond film based on a Fleming novel before 2006's ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. However, the credit style first used in ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' has been used on all Eon Bond films since ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', including ''Casino Royale''.\n\n===Script===\nBroccoli commissioned a number of writers to work on the script, including [[Stirling Silliphant]], [[John Landis]], [[Ronald Hardy]], [[Anthony Burgess]],<ref name=\"Burgess2014\">{{cite book|author=Anthony Burgess|title=You've Had Your Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AvZAgAAQBAJ|date=3 April 2014|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4735-1239-9|page=313}}</ref> and [[Derek Marlowe]]. The British television producer [[Gerry Anderson]] also stated that he provided a [[film treatment]] (although originally planned to be [[Moonraker (film)|''Moonraker'']]) very similar to what ended up as ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Archer | first = Simon |author2=Nicholls, Stan | title = Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Biography | year = 1996 | publisher = Legend Books | pages = 149\u2013150 | isbn = 0-09-978141-7}}</ref>\n\nEventually, [[Richard Maibaum]] provided the screenplay, and at first he tried to incorporate ideas from all of the other writers into his script. Maibaum's original script featured an alliance of international terrorists attacking SPECTRE's headquarters and deposing Blofeld, before trying to destroy the world for themselves to make way for a New World Order. However, this was shelved.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|date=1983|first=Lee|last=Goldberg|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-068/068#page/n26/mode/1up/search/%22richard+maibaum%22|page=63|title=Richard Maibaum 007's Puppermaster}}</ref>\n\nAfter Gilbert was reinstated as director, he decided to bring in another writer, [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]]. Gilbert also decided to fix what he felt the previous Roger Moore films were doing wrong, which was writing the Bond character too much the way [[Sean Connery]] played him, and instead portray Bond closer to the books&nbsp;\u2014 \"very English, very smooth, good sense of humour\". Broccoli asked Wood to create a villain with metal teeth, Jaws, inspired by a brace-wearing henchman named Horror in Fleming's novel.<ref name=inside/>\n\nBroccoli agreed to Wood's proposed changes, but before he could set to work there were more legal complications. In the years since ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', [[Kevin McClory]] had set up two film companies and was trying to make a new Bond film in collaboration with [[Sean Connery]] and novelist [[Len Deighton]]. McClory had learned of Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film ''Thunderball'', back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s. McClory threatened to sue Broccoli for copyright infringement, claiming that he had the sole right to include SPECTRE and its agents in all films. Not wishing to extend [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|the already ongoing legal dispute]] that could have delayed the production of ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', Broccoli requested Wood remove all references to Blofeld and SPECTRE from the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/tswlm_script_history.php3 |title=The Spy Who Loved Me: Script History |accessdate=3 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213230711/http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/tswlm_script_history.php3 |archivedate=13 February 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn the film, Stromberg's scheme to destroy civilisation by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines and have them fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.\n\nThe scheme in which the villain wishes to destroy mankind to create a new race or new civilisation was also used in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', the next film after ''The Spy Who Loved Me''. In ''Moonraker'', the villain [[Hugo Drax]] had an obsession with starting human civilisation over again on Earth, using specially chosen \"superior human specimens\" based in space. The film ''Moonraker'' was also written by Christopher Wood.\n\n[[Tom Mankiewicz]], who worked on the three preceding Bond films, claims he was called in to do an extensive rewrite of the script. Mankiewicz says he did not receive credit, because Broccoli was limited to the number of non-British in key positions he could employ on the films to obtain [[Eady Levy]] assistance.<ref name=\"tom\">{{cite book |author=Tom Mankiewicz |author2=Robert Crane |title=My Life as a Mankiewicz: An Insider's Journey through Hollywood |series=Screen Classics |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |year=2012 |page=163 |isbn=978-0813136059}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Lotus Esprit submarine.jpg|180px|right|thumb|The [[Lotus Esprit]] as seen diving into the sea and then in submarine mode.]]\nTom Mankiewicz claims that [[Catherine Deneuve]] wanted to play the female lead and was willing to cut her normal rate from $400,000 per picture to $250,000, but Broccoli would not pay above $80,000.<ref name=\"tom\"/>\n\nThe film was shot at the [[Pinewood Studios]] in London, [[Porto Cervo]] in Sardinia (Hotel Cala di Volpe), Egypt ([[Karnak]], [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]], [[Gayer-Anderson Museum]], [[Abu Simbel temples]]), [[Malta]], Scotland, Hayling Island UK, [[Okinawa]], Switzerland and [[Mount Asgard]] on [[Baffin Island]] in the then northern Canadian territory of [[Northwest Territories]] (now located in [[Nunavut]]).<ref>{{cite video|title=Exotic Locations|location=The Spy Who Loved Me, Ultimate Edition: Disk 2|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nAs no studio was big enough for the interior of Stromberg's supertanker, and set designer [[Ken Adam]] did not want to repeat what he had done with SPECTRE's volcano base in ''You Only Live Twice''\u2014\"a workable but ultimately wasteful set\"\u2014construction began in March 1976 of a new sound stage at Pinewood, the [[007 Stage]], at a cost of $1.8 million.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Frayling |first= Christopher |year= 2005 |title= Ken Adam and the Art of Production Design |publisher= Macmillan Publishers |location= London/New York City |isbn= 978-0-571-22057-1 |page= [https://archive.org/details/kenadamartofprod00fray/page/179 179] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/kenadamartofprod00fray/page/179 }}</ref> To complement this stage, Eon also paid for building a water tank capable of storing approximately 1,200,000 gallons (5,500,000 litres). The soundstage was so huge that cinematographer [[Claude Renoir]] found himself unable to effectively light it due to his deteriorating eyesight, and so [[Stanley Kubrick]] visited the production, in secret, to advise on how to light the stage.<ref name=comm/> For the exterior, while [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] was willing to lend an abandoned tanker to the production, the elevated insurance and safety risks caused it to be replaced with miniatures built by [[Derek Meddings]]' team and shot in the Bahamas.<ref name=inside/> Stromberg's shark tank was also filmed in the Bahamas, using a live shark in a saltwater swimming pool.<ref name=comm>{{cite video|people=Lewis Gilbert, Ken Adam, Michael G.

Don McLaughlan, then head of [[public relations]] at [[Lotus Cars]], heard that Eon were shopping for a new Bond car. He drove a prototype [[Lotus Esprit]] with all Lotus branding taped over, and parked it outside the Eon offices at Pinewood studios; on seeing the car Eon asked Lotus to borrow both of the prototypes for filming. Initial filming of the car chase sequence resulted in disappointing action sequences. While moving the car between shoots, Lotus test driver Roger Becker so impressed the crew with his handling of the car that for the rest of filming on Sardinia, Becker became the stunt driver.<ref name=inside/><ref>{{cite news |last=Nicholls|first=Mark|title=Former Lotus engineer recalls his time as a James Bond stunt driver |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/what-s-on/former_lotus_engineer_recalls_his_time_as_a_james_bond_stunt_driver_1_1671854|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe motorcycle [[sidecar]] missile used in one chase sequence was built by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard [[Kawasaki Z1|Kawasaki Z900]] and a custom made sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] could lie flat inside.

To perform the car becoming a submarine, seven different models were used, one for each step of the transformation. One of the models was [[Wet Nellie|a fully mobile submarine]] equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering the sea was a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed air cannon, whilst the first underwater shot of the car was a miniature model filmed in a test tank.  Three full size bodyshells were used to depict the actual car-to-submersible transition.  During the model sequences, the air bubbles seen appearing from the vehicle were created by [[Alka-Seltzer]] tablets.<ref name=inside/>\n\nIn September, production moved to [[Egypt]].

Broccoli, he gave permission only for the title ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' to be used. Since the screenplay for the film had nothing to do with Fleming's original novel, Eon Productions, for the first time, authorised a [[novelisation]] based upon the script. This would also be the first regular Bond novel published since ''[[Colonel Sun]]'' nearly a decade earlier. [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], who co-authored the screenplay, was commissioned to write the book titled ''James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me''.\n\nThe novelisation and the screenplay, although both written by Wood, are somewhat different. In the novelisation, [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] is still active and after James Bond. Their role begins during the pre-title. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for the whereabouts of the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine tracking system (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The appearance of SMERSH conflicts with a number of Bond stories, including the film ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (1987), in which General Leonid Pushkin remarks that SMERSH has been defunct for over 20 years. It also differs from the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels in which SMERSH is said to have been put out of operation. Members of SMERSH from the novelisation include Amasova and her lover Sergei Barsov as well as Colonel-General Nikitin, a character from Fleming's novel ''[[From Russia, with Love (novel)|From Russia, with Love]]'' who has since become the head of SMERSH. In the book, Jaws remains attached to the magnet that Bond dips into the tank, as opposed to the film where Bond releases Jaws into the water.<ref>{{cite book | author = Wood, Christopher | year = 1977 | title = James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me | publisher = Glidrose Publications | isbn = 0-446-84544-2| quote =Now both hands were tearing at the magnet, and Jaws twisted furiously like a fish on the hook. As Bond watched in fascinated horror, a relentless triangle streaked up behind the stricken giant. A huge gray force launched itself through the wild water, and two rows of white teeth closed around the threshing flesh. }}</ref>\n\nThere are also a number of elements that are either underplayed for more plausibility (the Lotus does not have any gadgets on land, unlike the film version) or are expanded to give more background to the characters (Jaws has a full history, Nikitin is in lust with Amasova, Stromberg\u2019s name is Sigmond and is tall, bald and has a small fleshy growth on one finger - unlike the webbed fingered Karl Stromberg of the film).\nNeither the characters of Q or Miss Moneypenny appear in the novelisation.\nThe henchmen who falls off the roof in Cairo is killed when he lands on top of a piano, a death Wood reused in the script for his next Bond film, ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''.\n\n==Sale of props==\nThe [[Lotus Esprit]], also known as [[Wet Nellie]], capable of transforming from car to submarine in the film, was purchased for \u00a3616,000 at a [[London]] auction in October 2013 by [[Elon Musk]], who planned to rebuild the vehicle and attempt to make the fictional dual-purpose car be an actual dual-purpose car (underwater and on land).<ref name=tg20131018>{{cite news|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|title=Tesla founder Elon Musk buys James Bond's Lotus Esprit submarine car|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/tesla-elon-musk-james-bond-lotus-submarine-car|accessdate=26 October 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* ''[[007: Nightfire]]'', a 2002 video game featuring the'' Liparus'' and ''Atlantis'' settings from this film, which also includes a [[Aston Martin Vanquish|submarine-car]] not unlike the Lotus Esprit.\n* \"[[Our Man Bashir]]\", a 1995 episode of the television series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' was largely based on this film.\n* [[Outline of James Bond]]\n* [[Rinspeed sQuba]], a submersible car inspired by the film.<ref name=\"rinspeed sQuba\">{{cite web |author=Nidhi Goyal | url=http://www.industrytap.com/worlds-first-underwater-car-cruises-at-75-mph-on-land-1-9-mph-underwater/17549 | title=World's First Underwater Car Cruises at 75 MPH on Land and 1.9 MPH Underwater | publisher=Industry Tap | date=30 December 2013 | accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Wet Nellie]] \u2013 a custom-built [[submarine]] created for the 1977 [[James Bond]] film ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', in the shape of a [[Lotus Esprit]] S1 sports car.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title= James Bond, The Spy I Loved|last= Wood|first= Christopher|authorlink= Christopher Wood (writer)|year= 2006|publisher= Twenty First Century Publishers|isbn= 1-904433-53-7}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.mgm.com/view/Movie/1891/The-Spy-who-loved-Me/ MGM's official ''the Spy Who Loved Me'' website]\n* {{IMDb title|0076752|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{tcmdb title|24269|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{amg movie|46311|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{mojo title|spywholovedme|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|spy_who_loved_me|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{AFI film|56112}}\n\n{{James Bond films}}\n{{Lewis Gilbert}}\n{{Stanley Kubrick}}\n{{good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spy Who Loved Me, The}}\n[[Category:The Spy Who Loved Me (film)| ]]\n[[Category:1970s action thriller films]]\n[[Category:1970s spy films]]\n[[Category:1970s sequel films]]\n[[Category:1977 films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British sequel films]]\n[[Category:Cold War spy films]]\n[[Category:Cold War submarine films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about nuclear war and weapons]]\n[[Category:British films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Lewis Gilbert]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Albert R.

[[Barbara Bach]] and [[Curd J\u00fcrgens]] co-star. It was directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]] and the screenplay was written by [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] and [[Richard Maibaum]].\n\nThe film takes its title from [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', the tenth book in the [[List of James Bond novels and stories|James Bond series]], though it does not contain any elements of the novel's plot. The storyline involves a reclusive megalomaniac named Karl Stromberg, who plans to destroy the world and create a new civilisation under the sea. Bond teams up with a [[Soviet Union|Russian]] agent, [[Anya Amasova]], to stop the plans, all while being hunted by Stromberg\u2019s powerful henchman, [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]].\n\nIt was shot on location in [[Egypt]] ([[Cairo]] and [[Luxor]]) and [[Italy]] ([[Costa Smeralda]], [[Sardinia]]), with underwater scenes filmed at [[the Bahamas]] ([[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]), and a [[007 Stage|new soundstage]] built at [[Pinewood Studios]] for a massive set which depicted the interior of a [[supertanker]]. ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' was well-received by critics, who saw the film as a return to form for the franchise. The soundtrack composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] also met with success. The film was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] amid many other nominations and novelised in 1977 by Christopher Wood as ''[[James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Royal Navy|British]] and a [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]] [[Ballistic Missile Submarine|ballistic-missile submarine]] suddenly disappear. James Bond \u2014 [[MI6]] agent 007 \u2014 is summoned to investigate. On the way to his briefing, Bond escapes an ambush by a squad of Soviet agents in [[Austria]], killing one during a downhill ski chase and evading the others. The plans for a highly advanced submarine tracking system are being offered in [[Egypt]]. There, Bond encounters Major Anya Amasova\u2014[[KGB]] agent Triple X\u2014his rival to recover the [[microfilm]] plans. They travel across Egypt together, encountering [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]] \u2013 a tall assassin with razor-sharp steel teeth \u2013 along the way. Bond and Amasova reluctantly join forces after a truce is agreed by their respective British and Soviet superiors. They identify the person responsible for the thefts as the shipping tycoon and scientist Karl Stromberg.\n\nWhile travelling by train to Stromberg's base in [[Sardinia]], Bond saves Amasova from Jaws, and their cooling rivalry turns to affection. Posing as a [[oceanography|marine biologist]] and his wife, they visit Stromberg's base and discover that he has launched a mysterious new supertanker, the ''Liparus'', nine months previously. As they leave the base, a henchman on a motorcycle featuring a rocket sidecar, Jaws in a car, and Naomi, an assistant/pilot of Stromberg in an attack helicopter, chase them, but Bond and Amasova escape underwater when his car \u2013 a [[Lotus Esprit]] from [[Q Branch]] \u2013 converts into a submarine. Jaws survives a car crash and Naomi is killed when Bond fires a sea-air missile from his car which destroys her helicopter. While examining Stromberg's underwater ''Atlantis'' base, the pair confirm that he is operating the stolen tracking system and encounter a fleet of Stromberg's minisubs which Amasova obliterates by launching mines. Bond finds out that the ''Liparus'' has never visited any known port or harbour. Amasova discovers that Bond killed her lover Sergei Barsov (as shown at the beginning of the movie), and she vows to kill Bond as soon as their mission is complete.\n\n[[File:Strongberglair.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Stromberg's hideout, ''Atlantis''.]]\n\nBond and Amasova board an [[SSN (hull classification symbol)|American submarine]] to examine the ''Liparus'' as it captures the submarine. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: the simultaneous launching of nuclear missiles from the captured British and Soviet submarines to obliterate Moscow and New York City. This would trigger a global nuclear war, which Stromberg would survive in ''Atlantis'', and subsequently a new civilization would be established underwater. He leaves for ''Atlantis'' with Amasova. Bond escapes and frees the captured British, Russian, and American sailors and they battle the ''Liparus''{{'}}s crew, but the joint U.S., U.K., and U.S.S.R. submariner coalition suffers heavy casualties just taking back the sub pen before managing to breach the control room, only to learn from the dying captain of the ''Liparus'' that the commandeered British and Soviet submarines are primed to fire their nukes in only a few minutes to ignite [[World War III]]. Bond reprograms the submarines to fire the nukes at each other, saving Moscow and New York City while destroying the subs and Stromberg's crews on both of them in the resulting [[nuclear explosion]]s. The victorious submariners escape the sinking ''Liparus'' on the American submarine.\n\nThe submarine is ordered by the Pentagon to destroy ''Atlantis'' but Bond insists on rescuing Amasova first. He confronts and kills Stromberg but again encounters Jaws, whom he drops into a shark tank. However, Jaws kills the shark and escapes. Bond and Amasova flee in an [[escape pod]] as ''Atlantis'' is sunk by torpedoes. Amasova picks up Bond's gun and points it at him, but then chooses not to kill him and the two embrace. The Royal Navy recovers the pod and the two spies are seen in an intimate embrace through its port window, much to the bemusement of their superiors on the ship.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BondAndJaws.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Roger Moore as Bond fighting Richard Kiel as Jaws inside ''Atlantis.'']] -->\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] 007: A British MI6 agent assigned to investigate the theft of two submarines.\n* [[Barbara Bach]] as [[Anya Amasova]]/Agent Triple X: A Soviet [[KGB]] agent also investigating the theft.

Saltzman had branched out into several other ventures of dubious promise and consequently was struggling through personal financial reversals unrelated to Bond. This was exacerbated by the twin personal tragedies of his wife's terminal cancer and many of the symptoms of clinical depression in himself.<ref>{{cite video | people = | title = Harry Saltzman, Showman | medium = Television documentary | publisher = MGM | accessdate = 5 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nAnother troubling aspect of the production was the difficulty in obtaining a director. The producers approached [[Steven Spielberg]], who was in post-production for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', but ultimately decided against him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/i-spy-25-fascinating-bond-facts-1-5097132|title=I spy...25 fascinating Bond facts|date=6 November 2012|website=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|website=[[The Independent]]|title=Steven Spielberg reveals he was rejected as Bond director twice|first=Jacob|last=Stolworthy|date=18 July 2016|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/steven-spielberg-james-bond-the-bfg-moonraker-broccoli-007-jaws-close-encounters-a7142731.html}}</ref> The first director attached to the film was [[Guy Hamilton]], who directed the previous three Bond films as well as ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', but he left after being offered the opportunity to direct the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', although [[Richard Donner]] took over the project.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The complete James Bond movie encyclopedia|first=Steven Jay |last=Rubin|publisher=Contemporary Books|year=2003|isbn=978-0-07-141246-9|page=392}}</ref> Eon Productions later turned to [[Lewis Gilbert]], who had directed the earlier Bond film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''.\n\nWith a director finally secured, the next hurdle was finishing the script, which had gone through several revisions by numerous writers. The initial villain of the film was [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]; however [[Kevin McClory]], who owned the film rights to ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' obtained an [[injunction]] barring Eon Productions from using the character of Blofeld, or his international criminal organisation, [[SPECTRE]], which delayed production of the film further. The villain was later changed from Blofeld to Stromberg so that the injunction would not interfere with the production. [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] was later brought in by Gilbert to complete the script. Although Fleming had requested that no elements from his original book be used, the film characters of [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]] and Sandor are based on the novel characters Sol Horror and Sluggsy Morant, respectively. Horror is described as having steel-capped teeth, while Sluggsy had a clear bald head.\n\nSince [[Ian Fleming]] permitted Eon to use only the name of his novel but not the actual plot,<ref name=Aldis-2020/> Fleming's name was moved for the first time from above the film's title to above \"James Bond 007\". His name reverted to the traditional location for ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', the last Eon Bond film based on a Fleming novel before 2006's ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. However, the credit style first used in ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' has been used on all Eon Bond films since ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', including ''Casino Royale''.\n\n===Script===\nBroccoli commissioned a number of writers to work on the script, including [[Stirling Silliphant]], [[John Landis]], [[Ronald Hardy]], [[Anthony Burgess]],<ref name=\"Burgess2014\">{{cite book|author=Anthony Burgess|title=You've Had Your Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AvZAgAAQBAJ|date=3 April 2014|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4735-1239-9|page=313}}</ref> and [[Derek Marlowe]]. The British television producer [[Gerry Anderson]] also stated that he provided a [[film treatment]] (although originally planned to be [[Moonraker (film)|''Moonraker'']]) very similar to what ended up as ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Archer | first = Simon |author2=Nicholls, Stan | title = Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Biography | year = 1996 | publisher = Legend Books | pages = 149\u2013150 | isbn = 0-09-978141-7}}</ref>\n\nEventually, [[Richard Maibaum]] provided the screenplay, and at first he tried to incorporate ideas from all of the other writers into his script. Maibaum's original script featured an alliance of international terrorists attacking SPECTRE's headquarters and deposing Blofeld, before trying to destroy the world for themselves to make way for a New World Order. However, this was shelved.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|date=1983|first=Lee|last=Goldberg|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-068/068#page/n26/mode/1up/search/%22richard+maibaum%22|page=63|title=Richard Maibaum 007's Puppermaster}}</ref>\n\nAfter Gilbert was reinstated as director, he decided to bring in another writer, [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]]. Gilbert also decided to fix what he felt the previous Roger Moore films were doing wrong, which was writing the Bond character too much the way [[Sean Connery]] played him, and instead portray Bond closer to the books&nbsp;\u2014 \"very English, very smooth, good sense of humour\". Broccoli asked Wood to create a villain with metal teeth, Jaws, inspired by a brace-wearing henchman named Horror in Fleming's novel.<ref name=inside/>\n\nBroccoli agreed to Wood's proposed changes, but before he could set to work there were more legal complications. In the years since ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', [[Kevin McClory]] had set up two film companies and was trying to make a new Bond film in collaboration with [[Sean Connery]] and novelist [[Len Deighton]]. McClory had learned of Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film ''Thunderball'', back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s. McClory threatened to sue Broccoli for copyright infringement, claiming that he had the sole right to include SPECTRE and its agents in all films. Not wishing to extend [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|the already ongoing legal dispute]] that could have delayed the production of ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', Broccoli requested Wood remove all references to Blofeld and SPECTRE from the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/tswlm_script_history.php3 |title=The Spy Who Loved Me: Script History |accessdate=3 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213230711/http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/tswlm_script_history.php3 |archivedate=13 February 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn the film, Stromberg's scheme to destroy civilisation by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines and have them fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.\n\nThe scheme in which the villain wishes to destroy mankind to create a new race or new civilisation was also used in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', the next film after ''The Spy Who Loved Me''. In ''Moonraker'', the villain [[Hugo Drax]] had an obsession with starting human civilisation over again on Earth, using specially chosen \"superior human specimens\" based in space. The film ''Moonraker'' was also written by Christopher Wood.\n\n[[Tom Mankiewicz]], who worked on the three preceding Bond films, claims he was called in to do an extensive rewrite of the script. Mankiewicz says he did not receive credit, because Broccoli was limited to the number of non-British in key positions he could employ on the films to obtain [[Eady Levy]] assistance.<ref name=\"tom\">{{cite book |author=Tom Mankiewicz |author2=Robert Crane |title=My Life as a Mankiewicz: An Insider's Journey through Hollywood |series=Screen Classics |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |year=2012 |page=163 |isbn=978-0813136059}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Lotus Esprit submarine.jpg|180px|right|thumb|The [[Lotus Esprit]] as seen diving into the sea and then in submarine mode.]]\nTom Mankiewicz claims that [[Catherine Deneuve]] wanted to play the female lead and was willing to cut her normal rate from $400,000 per picture to $250,000, but Broccoli would not pay above $80,000.<ref name=\"tom\"/>\n\nThe film was shot at the [[Pinewood Studios]] in London, [[Porto Cervo]] in Sardinia (Hotel Cala di Volpe), Egypt ([[Karnak]], [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]], [[Gayer-Anderson Museum]], [[Abu Simbel temples]]), [[Malta]], Scotland, Hayling Island UK, [[Okinawa]], Switzerland and [[Mount Asgard]] on [[Baffin Island]] in the then northern Canadian territory of [[Northwest Territories]] (now located in [[Nunavut]]).<ref>{{cite video|title=Exotic Locations|location=The Spy Who Loved Me, Ultimate Edition: Disk 2|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nAs no studio was big enough for the interior of Stromberg's supertanker, and set designer [[Ken Adam]] did not want to repeat what he had done with SPECTRE's volcano base in ''You Only Live Twice''\u2014\"a workable but ultimately wasteful set\"\u2014construction began in March 1976 of a new sound stage at Pinewood, the [[007 Stage]], at a cost of $1.8 million.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Frayling |first= Christopher |year= 2005 |title= Ken Adam and the Art of Production Design |publisher= Macmillan Publishers |location= London/New York City |isbn= 978-0-571-22057-1 |page= [https://archive.org/details/kenadamartofprod00fray/page/179 179] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/kenadamartofprod00fray/page/179 }}</ref> To complement this stage, Eon also paid for building a water tank capable of storing approximately 1,200,000 gallons (5,500,000 litres). The soundstage was so huge that cinematographer [[Claude Renoir]] found himself unable to effectively light it due to his deteriorating eyesight, and so [[Stanley Kubrick]] visited the production, in secret, to advise on how to light the stage.<ref name=comm/> For the exterior, while [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] was willing to lend an abandoned tanker to the production, the elevated insurance and safety risks caused it to be replaced with miniatures built by [[Derek Meddings]]' team and shot in the Bahamas.<ref name=inside/> Stromberg's shark tank was also filmed in the Bahamas, using a live shark in a saltwater swimming pool.<ref name=comm>{{cite video|people=Lewis Gilbert, Ken Adam, Michael G.

Don McLaughlan, then head of [[public relations]] at [[Lotus Cars]], heard that Eon were shopping for a new Bond car. He drove a prototype [[Lotus Esprit]] with all Lotus branding taped over, and parked it outside the Eon offices at Pinewood studios; on seeing the car Eon asked Lotus to borrow both of the prototypes for filming. Initial filming of the car chase sequence resulted in disappointing action sequences. While moving the car between shoots, Lotus test driver Roger Becker so impressed the crew with his handling of the car that for the rest of filming on Sardinia, Becker became the stunt driver.<ref name=inside/><ref>{{cite news |last=Nicholls|first=Mark|title=Former Lotus engineer recalls his time as a James Bond stunt driver |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/what-s-on/former_lotus_engineer_recalls_his_time_as_a_james_bond_stunt_driver_1_1671854|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe motorcycle [[sidecar]] missile used in one chase sequence was built by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard [[Kawasaki Z1|Kawasaki Z900]] and a custom made sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] wheels on each side, a [[Suzuki GT series#GT185|Suzuki 185]] engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving the outfit were speeded up as the weight of the sidecar made the outfit very difficult to control.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crichton|first=Brian|date=July 1978|title=The chair that nearly got Bond|journal=Motor Cycle Mechanics|publisher=EMAP National Publications Ltd|location=Peterborough|volume=22|issue=10|pages=26\u201327}}</ref>\n\nIn October, the second unit travelled to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] to film the underwater sequences. To perform the car becoming a submarine, seven different models were used, one for each step of the transformation. One of the models was [[Wet Nellie|a fully mobile submarine]] equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering the sea was a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed air cannon, whilst the first underwater shot of the car was a miniature model filmed in a test tank.  Three full size bodyshells were used to depict the actual car-to-submersible transition.  During the model sequences, the air bubbles seen appearing from the vehicle were created by [[Alka-Seltzer]] tablets.<ref name=inside/>\n\nIn September, production moved to [[Egypt]].

Broccoli, he gave permission only for the title ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' to be used. Since the screenplay for the film had nothing to do with Fleming's original novel, Eon Productions, for the first time, authorised a [[novelisation]] based upon the script. This would also be the first regular Bond novel published since ''[[Colonel Sun]]'' nearly a decade earlier. [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], who co-authored the screenplay, was commissioned to write the book titled ''James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me''.\n\nThe novelisation and the screenplay, although both written by Wood, are somewhat different. In the novelisation, [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] is still active and after James Bond. Their role begins during the pre-title. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for the whereabouts of the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine tracking system (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The appearance of SMERSH conflicts with a number of Bond stories, including the film ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (1987), in which General Leonid Pushkin remarks that SMERSH has been defunct for over 20 years. It also differs from the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels in which SMERSH is said to have been put out of operation. Members of SMERSH from the novelisation include Amasova and her lover Sergei Barsov as well as Colonel-General Nikitin, a character from Fleming's novel ''[[From Russia, with Love (novel)|From Russia, with Love]]'' who has since become the head of SMERSH. In the book, Jaws remains attached to the magnet that Bond dips into the tank, as opposed to the film where Bond releases Jaws into the water.<ref>{{cite book | author = Wood, Christopher | year = 1977 | title = James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me | publisher = Glidrose Publications | isbn = 0-446-84544-2| quote =Now both hands were tearing at the magnet, and Jaws twisted furiously like a fish on the hook. As Bond watched in fascinated horror, a relentless triangle streaked up behind the stricken giant. A huge gray force launched itself through the wild water, and two rows of white teeth closed around the threshing flesh. }}</ref>\n\nThere are also a number of elements that are either underplayed for more plausibility (the Lotus does not have any gadgets on land, unlike the film version) or are expanded to give more background to the characters (Jaws has a full history, Nikitin is in lust with Amasova, Stromberg\u2019s name is Sigmond and is tall, bald and has a small fleshy growth on one finger - unlike the webbed fingered Karl Stromberg of the film).\nNeither the characters of Q or Miss Moneypenny appear in the novelisation.\nThe henchmen who falls off the roof in Cairo is killed when he lands on top of a piano, a death Wood reused in the script for his next Bond film, ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''.\n\n==Sale of props==\nThe [[Lotus Esprit]], also known as [[Wet Nellie]], capable of transforming from car to submarine in the film, was purchased for \u00a3616,000 at a [[London]] auction in October 2013 by [[Elon Musk]], who planned to rebuild the vehicle and attempt to make the fictional dual-purpose car be an actual dual-purpose car (underwater and on land).<ref name=tg20131018>{{cite news|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|title=Tesla founder Elon Musk buys James Bond's Lotus Esprit submarine car|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/tesla-elon-musk-james-bond-lotus-submarine-car|accessdate=26 October 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* ''[[007: Nightfire]]'', a 2002 video game featuring the'' Liparus'' and ''Atlantis'' settings from this film, which also includes a [[Aston Martin Vanquish|submarine-car]] not unlike the Lotus Esprit.\n* \"[[Our Man Bashir]]\", a 1995 episode of the television series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' was largely based on this film.\n* [[Outline of James Bond]]\n* [[Rinspeed sQuba]], a submersible car inspired by the film.<ref name=\"rinspeed sQuba\">{{cite web |author=Nidhi Goyal | url=http://www.industrytap.com/worlds-first-underwater-car-cruises-at-75-mph-on-land-1-9-mph-underwater/17549 | title=World's First Underwater Car Cruises at 75 MPH on Land and 1.9 MPH Underwater | publisher=Industry Tap | date=30 December 2013 | accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Wet Nellie]] \u2013 a custom-built [[submarine]] created for the 1977 [[James Bond]] film ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', in the shape of a [[Lotus Esprit]] S1 sports car.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title= James Bond, The Spy I Loved|last= Wood|first= Christopher|authorlink= Christopher Wood (writer)|year= 2006|publisher= Twenty First Century Publishers|isbn= 1-904433-53-7}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.mgm.com/view/Movie/1891/The-Spy-who-loved-Me/ MGM's official ''the Spy Who Loved Me'' website]\n* {{IMDb title|0076752|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{tcmdb title|24269|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{amg movie|46311|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{mojo title|spywholovedme|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|spy_who_loved_me|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{AFI film|56112}}\n\n{{James Bond films}}\n{{Lewis Gilbert}}\n{{Stanley Kubrick}}\n{{good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spy Who Loved Me, The}}\n[[Category:The Spy Who Loved Me (film)| ]]\n[[Category:1970s action thriller films]]\n[[Category:1970s spy films]]\n[[Category:1970s sequel films]]\n[[Category:1977 films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British sequel films]]\n[[Category:Cold War spy films]]\n[[Category:Cold War submarine films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about nuclear war and weapons]]\n[[Category:British films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Lewis Gilbert]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Albert R.
