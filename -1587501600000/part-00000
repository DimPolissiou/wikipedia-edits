He was sentenced to death and held on [[Death Row]] at [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] prior to his execution in an [[electric chair]].\n\nSister [[Helen Prejean]], a teacher and one of the [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille]] from New Orleans, began to write to him and later served as his spiritual adviser. In her book ''[[Dead Man Walking (book)|Dead Man Walking]]'' (1993), she explored her experiences with men on Death Row and the basis for her growing opposition to the death penalty. The book  was adapted as a 1995 [[Dead Man Walking (film)|film of the same name]], starring [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Sean Penn]].

A teacher in New Orleans, she was one of the [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille]] and had acted as spiritual adviser to another inmate on Death Row.\n\nWillie was held on Death Row pending his execution, as appeals made their way through the courts. As was customary for such inmates, he was isolated socially and unable to work or participate in prison programs. After some time, Sister Prejean began to visit him and became his spiritual adviser. As she recounted in a book (see below), she worked to acknowledge him as a human being, help him acknowledge his crimes and reconcile with God.\n\n==Execution==\nWillie was the 32nd person executed in the United States since 1977. That year, judicial executions resumed after the [[Gregg v. Georgia|US Supreme Court had ruled that states needed to revise their death penalty statutes]] to meet constitutional concerns. As of February 2018, Willie's execution is the only one successfully carried out in the post-[[Furman v. Georgia|Furman]] era between Christmas and New Year.\n\nWillie was the [[List of people executed in Louisiana|sixth man in Louisiana to be executed]] in a 13-month period.<ref name=DeParle/> He asked Sister Prejean to be with him the day of the execution; he was also visited by his mother and brothers.

A teacher in New Orleans, she was one of the [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille]] and had acted as spiritual adviser to another inmate on Death Row.\n\nWillie was held on Death Row pending his execution, as appeals made their way through the courts. As was customary for such inmates, he was isolated socially and unable to work or participate in prison programs. After some time, Sister Prejean began to visit him and became his spiritual adviser. As she recounted in a book (see below), she worked to acknowledge him as a human being, help him acknowledge his crimes and reconcile with God.\n\n==Execution==\nWillie was the 32nd person executed in the United States since 1977. That year, judicial executions resumed after the [[Gregg v. Georgia|US Supreme Court had ruled that states needed to revise their death penalty statutes]] to meet constitutional concerns. As of February 2018, Willie's execution is the only one successfully carried out in the post-[[Furman v.

In the [[human body]] there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, one on each side of the [[vertebral column]]. These are grouped into the corresponding [[cervical vertebrae|cervical]], [[thoracic vertebrae|thoracic]], [[lumbar vertebrae|lumbar]], [[sacral vertebrae|sacral]] and [[coccygeal vertebrae|coccygeal]] regions of the spine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spinal Nerves|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2007/MB_cgi?mode=&term=Spinal+nerves|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=12 April 2014}}</ref> There are eight pairs of '''cervical nerves''', twelve pairs of '''thoracic nerves''', five pairs of '''lumbar nerves''', five pairs of '''sacral nerves''', and one pair of '''coccygeal nerves'''. The spinal nerves are part of the [[peripheral nervous system]].\n\n== Structure ==\n\n[[File:Gray675.png|thumb|left|240px|Spinal nerve]]\n[[File:Cervical vertebra english.png|thumb|240px|Typical spinal nerve location]]\nEach spinal nerve is a mixed nerve, formed from the combination of [[axon|nerve fibers]] from its  [[Dorsal root of spinal nerve|dorsal]] and [[Ventral root of spinal nerve|ventral roots]]. The dorsal root is the [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] sensory root and carries sensory information to the brain. The ventral root is the [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] motor root and carries motor information from the brain. The spinal nerve emerges from the spinal column through an opening ([[intervertebral foramen]]) between adjacent vertebrae. This is true for all spinal nerves except for the first spinal nerve pair (C1), which emerges between the [[occipital bone]] and the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] (the first vertebra). Thus the cervical nerves are numbered by the vertebra below, except spinal nerve C8, which exists below vertebra C7 and above vertebra T1. The thoracic, lumbar, and sacral nerves are then numbered by the vertebra above. In the case of a [[Lumbar vertebrae#Variation|lumbarized]] S1 vertebra (aka L6) or a [[Lumbar vertebrae#Variation|sacralized]] L5 vertebra, the nerves are typically still counted to L5 and the next nerve is S1.\n\n[[File:Gray799.svg|thumb|right|300px|Scheme showing structure of a typical spinal nerve<br />1. [[General somatic efferent fibers|Somatic efferent]].<br />2. [[General somatic afferent fibers|Somatic afferent]].<br />3,4,5. [[General visceral efferent fibers|Sympathetic efferent]].<br />6,7. [[General visceral afferent fibers|Autonomic afferent]].]]\nOutside the vertebral column, the nerve divides into branches. The [[dorsal ramus of spinal nerve|dorsal ramus]] contains nerves that serve the posterior portions of the trunk carrying visceral motor, somatic motor, and somatic sensory information to and from the skin and\nmuscles of the back ([[epaxial muscles]]). The [[ventral ramus]] contains nerves that serve the remaining anterior parts of the trunk and the upper and lower limbs ([[hypaxial muscles]]) carrying visceral motor, somatic motor, and sensory information to and from the ventrolateral body surface, structures in the body wall, and the limbs. The [[Meningeal branches of spinal nerve|meningeal branches (recurrent meningeal or sinuvertebral nerves)]] branch from the spinal nerve and re-enter the intervertebral foramen to serve the ligaments, dura, blood vessels, intervertebral discs, facet joints, and periosteum of the vertebrae. The [[rami communicantes]] contain autonomic nerves that serve visceral functions carrying visceral motor and sensory information to and from the visceral organs.\n\nSome anterior rami merge with adjacent anterior rami to form a [[nerve plexus]], a network of interconnecting nerves. Nerves emerging from a plexus contain fibers from various spinal nerves, which are now carried together to some target location. Major plexuses include the [[cervical plexus|cervical]], [[brachial plexus|brachial]], [[lumbar plexus|lumbar]], and [[sacral plexus|sacral]] plexuses.\n\n== Regional nerves ==\n{{Further |Spinal cord#Spinal cord segments}}\n\n=== Cervical nerves ===\n\n[[File:Gray795.png|thumb|Cervical nerves]]\n\nThe cervical nerves are the spinal nerves from the cervical vertebrae in the [[Spinal cord#Spinal cord segments|cervical segment]] of the spinal cord. Although there are seven cervical vertebrae (C1-C7), there are eight cervical nerves [[cervical spinal nerve 1|C1]]\u2013[[cervical spinal nerve 8|C8]]. All cervical nerves except C8 emerge above their corresponding vertebrae, while the C8 nerve emerges below the C7 vertebra. Elsewhere in the spine, the nerve emerges below the vertebra with the same name.\n\nThe posterior distribution includes the [[suboccipital nerve]] (C1), the [[greater occipital nerve]] (C2) and the [[third occipital nerve]] (C3). The anterior distribution includes the [[cervical plexus]] (C1-C4) and [[brachial plexus]] (C5-T1).\n\nThe cervical nerves innervate the [[sternohyoid muscle|sternohyoid]], [[sternothyroid muscle|sternothyroid]] and [[omohyoid muscle]]s.\n\nA loop of nerves called [[ansa cervicalis]] is part of the cervical plexus.\n\n=== Thoracic nerves ===\n\nThe thoracic nerves are the twelve spinal nerves emerging from the thoracic vertebrae. Each thoracic nerve T1 -T12 originates from below each corresponding [[thoracic vertebra]]. Branches also exit the spine and go directly to the [[paravertebral ganglia]] of the [[autonomic nervous system]] where they are involved in the functions of organs and glands in the head, neck, thorax and abdomen.\n\nAnterior divisions: The [[intercostal nerves]] come from thoracic nerves T1-T11, and run between the ribs. At T2 and T3, further branches form the [[intercostobrachial nerve]]. The [[subcostal nerve]] comes from nerve T12, and runs below the twelfth rib.\n\nPosterior divisions: The medial branches (ramus medialis) of the posterior branches of the upper six thoracic nerves run between the [[semispinalis dorsi]] and [[multifidus]], which they supply; they then pierce the [[rhomboid muscle|rhomboid]] and [[trapezius muscle]]s, and reach the skin by the sides of the spinous processes. This sensitive branch is called the medial cutaneous ramus.\n\nThe medial branches of the lower six are distributed chiefly to the multifidus and [[longissimus dorsi]], occasionally they give off filaments to the skin near the middle line. This sensitive branch is called the posterior cutaneous ramus.\n\n=== Lumbar nerves ===\n{{Further|List of lumbar nerves}}\n[[File:Gray823.png|thumb|Lumbar plexus and branches]]\nThe lumbar nerves are the five spinal nerves emerging from the lumbar vertebrae. They are divided into posterior and anterior divisions.\n\n'''Posterior divisions''': The medial branches of the posterior divisions of the lumbar nerves run close to the articular processes of the vertebrae and end in the [[multifidus muscle]].\n\nThe laterals supply the [[erector spinae muscles]].\n\nThe upper three give off cutaneous nerves which pierce the aponeurosis of the [[latissimus dorsi]] at the lateral border of the erector spinae muscles, and descend across the posterior part of the [[iliac crest]] to the skin of the [[buttock]], some of their twigs running as far as the level of the [[greater trochanter]].\n\n'''Anterior divisions''': The anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves (rami anteriores) increase in size from above downward. They are joined, near their origins, by [[gray rami communicantes]] from the [[lumbar ganglia]] of the [[sympathetic trunk]]. These rami consist of long, slender branches which accompany the [[lumbar arteries]] around the sides of the vertebral bodies, beneath the [[psoas major]]. Their arrangement is somewhat irregular: one ganglion may give rami to two lumbar nerves, or one lumbar nerve may receive rami from two [[ganglia]].\n\nThe first and second, and sometimes the third and fourth lumbar nerves are each connected with the lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk by a [[white ramus communicans]].\n\nThe nerves pass obliquely outward behind the psoas major, or between its [[Muscle fascicle|fasciculi]], distributing filaments to it and the [[quadratus lumborum]].\n\nThe first three and the greater part of the fourth are connected together in this situation by anastomotic loops, and form the [[lumbar plexus]].\n\nThe smaller part of the fourth joins with the fifth to form the [[lumbosacral trunk]], which assists in the formation of the [[sacral plexus]]. The fourth nerve is named the [[furcal nerve]], from the fact that it is subdivided between the two plexuses.\n\n=== Sacral nerves ===\n\n[[File: Gray828.png|thumb|Plan of sacral and pudendal plexuses]]\nThe '''sacral nerves''' are the five pairs of spinal nerves which exit the [[sacrum]] at the lower end of the [[Human vertebral column|vertebral column]]. The roots of these nerves begin inside the vertebral column at the level of the [[L1 vertebra]], where the [[cauda equina]] begins, and then descend into the sacrum.<ref>1. '''Anatomy, descriptive and surgical: Gray's anatomy'''. Gray, Henry. Philadelphia : Courage Books/Running Press, 1974</ref><ref>2. '''Clinically Oriented Anatomy'''. Moore, Keith L. Philadelphia : Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2010 (6th ed)</ref>\n\nThere are five paired sacral nerves, half of them arising through the sacrum on the left side and the other half on the right side. Each nerve emerges in two divisions: one division through the [[anterior sacral foramina]] and the other division through the [[posterior sacral foramina]].<ref>1. '''Anatomy, descriptive and surgical: Gray's anatomy'''. Gray, Henry. Philadelphia : Courage Books/Running Press, 1974</ref>\n\nThe nerves divide into branches and the branches from different nerves join with one another, some of them also joining with lumbar or coccygeal nerve branches. These anastomoses of nerves form the [[sacral plexus]] and the [[lumbosacral plexus]]. The branches of these plexus give rise to nerves that supply much of the [[hip]], [[thigh]], [[leg]] and [[foot]].<ref>1. '''Anatomy, descriptive and surgical: Gray's anatomy'''. Gray, Henry. Philadelphia : Courage Books/Running Press, 1974</ref><ref>3. '''Human Neuroanatomy'''. Carpenter, Malcolm B. Baltimore : Williams & Wilkins Co., 1976 (7th ed)</ref>\n\nThe sacral nerves have both [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] and [[efferent fibers]], thus they are responsible for part of the [[sensory perception]] and the movements of the lower extremities of the human body. From the S2, S3 and S4 arise the pudendal nerve and parasympathetic fibers whose electrical potential supply the [[descending colon]] and [[rectum]], [[urinary bladder]] and [[genital organs]]. These pathways have both afferent and efferent fibers and, this way, they are responsible for conduction of sensory information from these pelvic organs to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and motor impulses from the CNS to the pelvis that control the movements of these pelvic organs.<ref>3. '''Human Neuroanatomy'''. Carpenter, Malcolm B. Baltimore : Williams & Wilkins Co., 1976 (7th ed)</ref>\n\n=== Coccygeal nerve ===\n\nThe coccygeal nerve is the 31st pair of spinal nerves. It arises from the conus medullaris, and its anterior root helps form the [[coccygeal plexus]]. It does not divide into a medial and lateral branch. It is distributed to the skin over the back of the [[coccyx]].\n\n== Function ==\n\n[[File:Gray802.png|thumb|right| Areas of distribution of the cutaneous branches of the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves. The areas of the medial branches are in black, those of the lateral in red]]\n{{Actions by spinal nerves}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nThe muscles that one particular spinal root supplies are that nerve's [[myotome (anatomy)|myotome]], and the [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatomes]] are the areas of sensory innervation on the skin for each spinal nerve. Lesions of one or more nerve roots result in typical patterns of neurologic defects ([[muscle weakness]], abnormal sensation, changes in reflexes) that allow localization of the responsible lesion.\n\nThere are several procedures used in [[sacral nerve stimulation]] for the treatment of various related disorders.\n\n[[Sciatica]] is generally caused by the compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself\n\n== Additional Images ==\n\n<gallery>\n File:Gray796.png|A portion of the spinal cord, showing its right lateral surface.

The spinal nerves are part of the [[peripheral nervous system]].\n\n== Structure ==\n\n[[File:Gray675.png|thumb|left|240px|Spinal nerve]]\n[[File:Cervical vertebra english.png|thumb|240px|Typical spinal nerve location]]\nEach spinal nerve is a mixed nerve, formed from the combination of [[axon|nerve fibers]] from its  [[Dorsal root of spinal nerve|dorsal]] and [[Ventral root of spinal nerve|ventral roots]]. The dorsal root is the [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] sensory root and carries sensory information to the brain. The ventral root is the [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] motor root and carries motor information from the brain. The spinal nerve emerges from the spinal column through an opening ([[intervertebral foramen]]) between adjacent vertebrae. This is true for all spinal nerves except for the first spinal nerve pair (C1), which emerges between the [[occipital bone]] and the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] (the first vertebra). Thus the cervical nerves are numbered by the vertebra below, except spinal nerve C8, which exists below vertebra C7 and above vertebra T1. The thoracic, lumbar, and sacral nerves are then numbered by the vertebra above. In the case of a [[Lumbar vertebrae#Variation|lumbarized]] S1 vertebra (aka L6) or a [[Lumbar vertebrae#Variation|sacralized]] L5 vertebra, the nerves are typically still counted to L5 and the next nerve is S1.\n\n[[File:Gray799.svg|thumb|right|300px|Scheme showing structure of a typical spinal nerve<br />1. [[General somatic efferent fibers|Somatic efferent]].<br />2. [[General somatic afferent fibers|Somatic afferent]].<br />3,4,5. [[General visceral efferent fibers|Sympathetic efferent]].<br />6,7. [[General visceral afferent fibers|Autonomic afferent]]]]\nOutside the vertebral column, the nerve divides into branches. The [[dorsal ramus of spinal nerve|dorsal ramus]] contains nerves that serve the posterior portions of the trunk carrying visceral motor, somatic motor, and somatic sensory information to and from the skin and\nmuscles of the back ([[epaxial muscles]]). The [[ventral ramus]] contains nerves that serve the remaining anterior parts of the trunk and the upper and lower limbs ([[hypaxial muscles]]) carrying visceral motor, somatic motor, and sensory information to and from the ventrolateral body surface, structures in the body wall, and the limbs. The [[Meningeal branches of spinal nerve|meningeal branches (recurrent meningeal or sinuvertebral nerves)]] branch from the spinal nerve and re-enter the intervertebral foramen to serve the ligaments, dura, blood vessels, intervertebral discs, facet joints, and periosteum of the vertebrae. The [[rami communicantes]] contain autonomic nerves that serve visceral functions carrying visceral motor and sensory information to and from the visceral organs.\n\nSome anterior rami merge with adjacent anterior rami to form a [[nerve plexus]], a network of interconnecting nerves. Nerves emerging from a plexus contain fibers from various spinal nerves, which are now carried together to some target location. Major plexuses include the [[cervical plexus|cervical]], [[brachial plexus|brachial]], [[lumbar plexus|lumbar]], and [[sacral plexus|sacral]] plexuses.\n\n== Regional nerves ==\n{{Further |Spinal cord#Spinal cord segments}}\n\n=== Cervical nerves ===\n\n[[File:Gray795.png|thumb|Cervical nerves]]\n\nThe cervical nerves are the spinal nerves from the cervical vertebrae in the [[Spinal cord#Spinal cord segments|cervical segment]] of the spinal cord. Although there are seven cervical vertebrae (C1-C7), there are eight cervical nerves [[cervical spinal nerve 1|C1]]\u2013[[cervical spinal nerve 8|C8]]. All cervical nerves except C8 emerge above their corresponding vertebrae, while the C8 nerve emerges below the C7 vertebra. Elsewhere in the spine, the nerve emerges below the vertebra with the same name.\n\nThe posterior distribution includes the [[suboccipital nerve]] (C1), the [[greater occipital nerve]] (C2) and the [[third occipital nerve]] (C3). The anterior distribution includes the [[cervical plexus]] (C1-C4) and [[brachial plexus]] (C5-T1).\n\nThe cervical nerves innervate the [[sternohyoid muscle|sternohyoid]], [[sternothyroid muscle|sternothyroid]] and [[omohyoid muscle]]s.\n\nA loop of nerves called [[ansa cervicalis]] is part of the cervical plexus.\n\n=== Thoracic nerves ===\n\nThe thoracic nerves are the twelve spinal nerves emerging from the thoracic vertebrae. Each thoracic nerve T1 -T12 originates from below each corresponding [[thoracic vertebra]]. Branches also exit the spine and go directly to the [[paravertebral ganglia]] of the [[autonomic nervous system]] where they are involved in the functions of organs and glands in the head, neck, thorax and abdomen.\n\nAnterior divisions: The [[intercostal nerves]] come from thoracic nerves T1-T11, and run between the ribs. At T2 and T3, further branches form the [[intercostobrachial nerve]]. The [[subcostal nerve]] comes from nerve T12, and runs below the twelfth rib.\n\nPosterior divisions: The medial branches (ramus medialis) of the posterior branches of the upper six thoracic nerves run between the [[semispinalis dorsi]] and [[multifidus]], which they supply; they then pierce the [[rhomboid muscle|rhomboid]] and [[trapezius muscle]]s, and reach the skin by the sides of the spinous processes. This sensitive branch is called the medial cutaneous ramus.\n\nThe medial branches of the lower six are distributed chiefly to the multifidus and [[longissimus dorsi]], occasionally they give off filaments to the skin near the middle line. This sensitive branch is called the posterior cutaneous ramus.\n\n=== Lumbar nerves ===\n{{Further|List of lumbar nerves}}\n[[File:Gray823.png|thumb|Lumbar plexus and branches]]\nThe lumbar nerves are the five spinal nerves emerging from the lumbar vertebrae. They are divided into posterior and anterior divisions.\n\n'''Posterior divisions''': The medial branches of the posterior divisions of the lumbar nerves run close to the articular processes of the vertebrae and end in the [[multifidus muscle]].\n\nThe laterals supply the [[erector spinae muscles]].\n\nThe upper three give off cutaneous nerves which pierce the aponeurosis of the [[latissimus dorsi]] at the lateral border of the erector spinae muscles, and descend across the posterior part of the [[iliac crest]] to the skin of the [[buttock]], some of their twigs running as far as the level of the [[greater trochanter]].\n\n'''Anterior divisions''': The anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves (rami anteriores) increase in size from above downward. They are joined, near their origins, by [[gray rami communicantes]] from the [[lumbar ganglia]] of the [[sympathetic trunk]]. These rami consist of long, slender branches which accompany the [[lumbar arteries]] around the sides of the vertebral bodies, beneath the [[psoas major]]. Their arrangement is somewhat irregular: one ganglion may give rami to two lumbar nerves, or one lumbar nerve may receive rami from two [[ganglia]].\n\nThe first and second, and sometimes the third and fourth lumbar nerves are each connected with the lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk by a [[white ramus communicans]].\n\nThe nerves pass obliquely outward behind the psoas major, or between its [[Muscle fascicle|fasciculi]], distributing filaments to it and the [[quadratus lumborum]].\n\nThe first three and the greater part of the fourth are connected together in this situation by anastomotic loops, and form the [[lumbar plexus]].\n\nThe smaller part of the fourth joins with the fifth to form the [[lumbosacral trunk]], which assists in the formation of the [[sacral plexus]]. The fourth nerve is named the [[furcal nerve]], from the fact that it is subdivided between the two plexuses.\n\n=== Sacral nerves ===\n\n[[File: Gray828.png|thumb|Plan of sacral and pudendal plexuses]]\nThe '''sacral nerves''' are the five pairs of spinal nerves which exit the [[sacrum]] at the lower end of the [[Human vertebral column|vertebral column]]. The roots of these nerves begin inside the vertebral column at the level of the [[L1 vertebra]], where the [[cauda equina]] begins, and then descend into the sacrum.<ref>1. '''Anatomy, descriptive and surgical: Gray's anatomy'''. Gray, Henry. Philadelphia : Courage Books/Running Press, 1974</ref><ref>2. '''Clinically Oriented Anatomy'''. Moore, Keith L. Philadelphia : Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2010 (6th ed)</ref>\n\nThere are five paired sacral nerves, half of them arising through the sacrum on the left side and the other half on the right side. Each nerve emerges in two divisions: one division through the [[anterior sacral foramina]] and the other division through the [[posterior sacral foramina]].<ref>1. '''Anatomy, descriptive and surgical: Gray's anatomy'''. Gray, Henry. Philadelphia : Courage Books/Running Press, 1974</ref>\n\nThe nerves divide into branches and the branches from different nerves join with one another, some of them also joining with lumbar or coccygeal nerve branches. These anastomoses of nerves form the [[sacral plexus]] and the [[lumbosacral plexus]]. The branches of these plexus give rise to nerves that supply much of the [[hip]], [[thigh]], [[leg]] and [[foot]].<ref>1. '''Anatomy, descriptive and surgical: Gray's anatomy'''. Gray, Henry. Philadelphia : Courage Books/Running Press, 1974</ref><ref>3. '''Human Neuroanatomy'''. Carpenter, Malcolm B. Baltimore : Williams & Wilkins Co., 1976 (7th ed)</ref>\n\nThe sacral nerves have both [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] and [[efferent fibers]], thus they are responsible for part of the [[sensory perception]] and the movements of the lower extremities of the human body. From the S2, S3 and S4 arise the pudendal nerve and parasympathetic fibers whose electrical potential supply the [[descending colon]] and [[rectum]], [[urinary bladder]] and [[genital organs]]. These pathways have both afferent and efferent fibers and, this way, they are responsible for conduction of sensory information from these pelvic organs to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and motor impulses from the CNS to the pelvis that control the movements of these pelvic organs.<ref>3. '''Human Neuroanatomy'''. Carpenter, Malcolm B. Baltimore : Williams & Wilkins Co., 1976 (7th ed)</ref>\n\n=== Coccygeal nerve ===\n\nThe coccygeal nerve is the 31st pair of spinal nerves. It arises from the conus medullaris, and its anterior root helps form the [[coccygeal plexus]]. It does not divide into a medial and lateral branch. It is distributed to the skin over the back of the [[coccyx]].\n\n== Function ==\n\n[[File:Gray802.png|thumb|right| Areas of distribution of the cutaneous branches of the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves. The areas of the medial branches are in black, those of the lateral in red]]\n{{Actions by spinal nerves}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nThe muscles that one particular spinal root supplies are that nerve's [[myotome (anatomy)|myotome]], and the [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatomes]] are the areas of sensory innervation on the skin for each spinal nerve. Lesions of one or more nerve roots result in typical patterns of neurologic defects ([[muscle weakness]], abnormal sensation, changes in reflexes) that allow localization of the responsible lesion.\n\nThere are several procedures used in [[sacral nerve stimulation]] for the treatment of various related disorders.\n\n[[Sciatica]] is generally caused by the compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself\n\n== Additional Images ==\n\n<gallery>\n File:Gray796.png|A portion of the spinal cord, showing its right lateral surface.

The club first appeared in 1941 fielding junior teams in the local intermediate league.  Their first league game in the intermediate league was against South Adelaide on Saturday 10 May 1941. The result was a 9\u20130 victory for Cumberland.\n\nCumberland's first senior game was on Saturday 8 May 1943 against the now defunct Perry Engineering Works.  The final score was a 9\u20130 win for Cumberland.  Dunbar, for Cumberland, found the net six times, Ingham scored twice and Edwards once. The game was played as a home game for Cumberland at Hollywood Estate, a then adjacent suburb.\n\nSince 1943 the club has won the championship twice and the Federation Cup once. In recent years significant in-roads have been made towards improving the club.\n\nJunior Football has gone from strength to strength while being one of the strongest teams in lots of junior age groups. The Club established a more focused junior program in 1990 which has continued to grow since then, with 17 teams currently playing at Bailey Reserve.  Many of the present senior players began their Club Football at Cumberland.  This has been one of the key objectives of the program now coming to fruition.\n\nCumberland United has remained true to its origins as a District Club.

Stem cuttings from woody plants are treated differently, depending on the maturity of the wood:\n*Softwood cuttings come from stems that are rapidly expanding, with young leaves. In many species, such cuttings form roots relatively easily.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cuttings: softwood|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=307|publisher=rhs.org.uk|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How to take softwood cuttings|url=http://www.gardenersworld.com/how-to/grow-plants/how-to-take-softwood-cuttings/|publisher=gardenersworld.com|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n*Semi-hardwood cuttings come from stems that have completed elongation growth and have mature leaves.\n*Hardwood cuttings come from fully matured stems, and are often propagated while dormant.\n\nMost plant cuttings are stem pieces, and have no root system of their own, they are likely to die from [[dehydration]] if the proper conditions are not met. They require a moist medium, which, however, cannot be too wet lest the cutting rot. A number of media are used in this process, including but not limited to soil, [[perlite]], [[vermiculite]], [[coir]], [[Mineral wool|rock wool]], [[expanded clay aggregate|expanded clay pellets]], and even water given the right conditions. Most [[succulent]] cuttings can be left in open air until the cut surface dries, which may improve root formation when the cutting is later planted.\n\nIn [[temperate countries]], stem cuttings may be taken of soft (green or semi-ripe) wood and hard wood which has specific differences in practice. Certain conditions lead to more favorable outcomes for cuttings; timing, size, location on the plant, and amount of foliage are all important. Stem cuttings of young wood should be taken in spring from the upper branches, while cuttings of hardened wood should be taken in winter from the lower branches. Common bounds on the length of stem cuttings are between {{convert|5|\u2013|15|cm}} for soft wood and between {{convert|20|\u2013|25|cm}} for hard wood.

The most common methods are:\n* Stem cuttings, in which a piece of stem is part buried in the soil, including at least one [[leaf node]]. The cutting is able to produce new roots, usually at the node.\n* Root cuttings, in which a section of root is buried just below the soil surface, and produces new shoots.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Jackie|title=What Are Root Cuttings: Information On Taking Cuttings From Root Growth|url=https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/propagation/cuttings/what-are-root-cuttings.htm|publisher=gardeningknowhow.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref>\n* Scion cuttings are used in [[grafting]].\n* [[Leaf]] cuttings, in which a leaf is placed on moist soil. These have to develop both new stems and new roots. Some leaves will produce one plant at the base of the leaf. In some species, multiple new plants can be produced at many places on one leaf, and these can be induced by cutting the [[leaf vein]]s. The leaf cutting method is commonly used with [[succulents]].\n\nAlthough some species, such as [[willow]], [[blackberry]] and [[pelargonium]]s can be grown simply by placing a cutting into moist ground, the majority of species require more attention. Most species require humid, warm, partially shaded conditions to strike, thus requiring the approach above to be followed. Particularly difficult species may need cool air above and warm soil. In addition, with many more difficult cuttings, one should use the type of cutting that has the most chance of success with that particular plant species.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthrecipes.com/plant_cuttings.htm |title=Certain plant species having more success with certain types of cuttings |publisher=Healthrecipes.com  |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Improving results ==\n[[Image:Cuttingsgreenhouse2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A white plastic greenhouse, used to keep the cuttings humid]]\nThere are ways of improving the growth of stem cutting propagations.

They require a moist medium, which, however, cannot be too wet lest the cutting rot. A number of media are used in this process, including but not limited to soil, [[perlite]], [[vermiculite]], [[coir]], [[Mineral wool|rock wool]], [[expanded clay aggregate|expanded clay pellets]], and even water given the right conditions. Most [[succulent]] cuttings can be left in open air until the cut surface dries, which may improve root formation when the cutting is later planted.\n\nIn [[temperate countries]], stem cuttings may be taken of soft (green or semi-ripe) wood and hard wood which has specific differences in practice. Certain conditions lead to more favorable outcomes for cuttings; timing, size, location on the plant, and amount of foliage are all important. Stem cuttings of young wood should be taken in spring from the upper branches, while cuttings of hardened wood should be taken in winter from the lower branches. Common bounds on the length of stem cuttings are between {{convert|5|\u2013|15|cm}} for soft wood and between {{convert|20|\u2013|25|cm}} for hard wood.

The most common methods are:\n* Stem cuttings, in which a piece of stem is part buried in the soil, including at least one [[leaf node]]. The cutting is able to produce new roots, usually at the node.\n* Root cuttings, in which a section of root is buried just below the soil surface, and produces new shoots.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Jackie|title=What Are Root Cuttings: Information On Taking Cuttings From Root Growth|url=https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/propagation/cuttings/what-are-root-cuttings.htm|publisher=gardeningknowhow.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref>\n* Scion cuttings are used in [[grafting]].\n* [[Leaf]] cuttings, in which a leaf is placed on moist soil. These have to develop both new stems and new roots. Some leaves will produce one plant at the base of the leaf. In some species, multiple new plants can be produced at many places on one leaf, and these can be induced by cutting the [[leaf vein]]s. The leaf cutting method is commonly used with [[succulents]].\n\nAlthough some species, such as [[willow]], [[blackberry]] and [[pelargonium]]s can be grown simply by placing a cutting into moist ground, the majority of species require more attention. Most species require humid, warm, partially shaded conditions to strike, thus requiring the approach above to be followed. Particularly difficult species may need cool air above and warm soil. In addition, with many more difficult cuttings, one should use the type of cutting that has the most chance of success with that particular plant species.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthrecipes.com/plant_cuttings.htm |title=Certain plant species having more success with certain types of cuttings |publisher=Healthrecipes.com  |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Improving results ==\n[[Image:Cuttingsgreenhouse2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A white plastic greenhouse, used to keep the cuttings humid]]\nThere are ways of improving the growth of stem cutting propagations.

The dragon was one of the [[Gigantes]], who battled the Olympic gods for ten years. As Minerva threw the dragon, it became twisted on itself and froze at the cold [[North Celestial Pole]] before it could right itself.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=237}}\n\nSometimes, Draco is represented as the Titan son of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Typhon]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=237}}\n\nTraditional Arabic astronomy does not depict a dragon in modern-day Draco, which is called the [[Mother Camels]]. Instead, two [[hyena]]s, represented by [[Eta Draconis]] and [[Zeta Draconis]] are seen attacking a baby camel (a dim star near [[Beta Draconis]]), which is protected by four female camels, represented by [[Beta Draconis]], [[Gamma Draconis]], [[Nu Draconis]], and [[Xi Draconis]]. The nomads who own the camels are camped nearby, represented by a cooking tripod composed of [[Upsilon Draconis|Upsilon]], [[Tau Draconis|Tau]], and [[Sigma Draconis]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=239}} In some mythology, Draco had one hundred magnificent heads, guarded the golden apple tree, and was put in the sky as a constellation for protecting the apples with valor.

The film also reveals that Draco is actually a dragon heaven, where dragons go when their time in this world is complete, and if they have upheld the oath of an ancient dragon to guard mankind, with dragons otherwise fading into nothing upon their deaths. At the conclusion of the film, Draco, the last dragon, ascends into the constellation after he sacrifices himself to destroy an evil king that he had saved years ago. This is further elaborated on in the sequel and prequel films that follow.\n\nThe [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation|Dragon Variation]] of the Sicilian Defense chess opening was also named after the constellation by Russian chess master [[Fyodor Dus-Chotimirsky]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Secrets of the Sicilian Dragon|last=Gufeld|first=Eduard|authorlink=Eduard Gufeld|date=June 1998|publisher=Cardoza Publishing|isbn=0-940685-92-2}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Beyblade (toy)|Beyblade]] top Lightning L-Drago 100HF and its evolutions Meteo L-Drago LW105LF and L-Drago Destructor F:S are inspired by/based on the Draco constellation.

At magnitude 14.4, it appears star-like, though it is at a distance of 12.9 billion light-years. The light of Q1634+706 has taken 8.6 billion years to reach Earth, a discrepancy attributable to the [[expansion of the universe]].<ref name=\"French\"/>\n\nThe [[Hercules\u2013Corona Borealis Great Wall]], possibly the largest known structure in the universe, covers a part of the southern region of Draco.\n\n=== Mythology ===\n\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Draco and Ursa Minor.jpg|thumb|left|Draco coils around the north celestial pole, as depicted in Urania's Mirror, a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825]]\n''Draco'' is one of the 48 constellations listed in Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' (2nd century), adopted from the list by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] (4th century BC).<ref>Thomas L. Heath, ''Greek Astronomy'' (1932), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=ny_eAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA118  p. 118].</ref>\nA dragon in Greek mythology that may have inspired the constellation's name is [[Dragons in Greek mythology|Ladon]], the dragon who guarded the golden apples of the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Hesperides]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=237}} [[Heracles]] killed Ladon during his [[labors of Hercules|12 labors]]; he was tasked with stealing the golden apples. [[Hercules (constellation)|The constellation of Hercules]] is depicted near Draco.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}}\n\nIn Greco-Roman legend, Draco was a dragon killed by the goddess [[Minerva]] and tossed into the sky upon his defeat. The dragon was one of the [[Gigantes]], who battled the Olympic gods for ten years. As Minerva threw the dragon, it became twisted on itself and froze at the cold [[North Celestial Pole]] before it could right itself.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=237}}\n\nSometimes, Draco is represented as the Titan son of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Typhon]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=237}}\n\nTraditional Arabic astronomy does not depict a dragon in modern-day Draco, which is called the [[Mother Camels]]. Instead, two [[hyena]]s, represented by [[Eta Draconis]] and [[Zeta Draconis]] are seen attacking a baby camel (a dim star near [[Beta Draconis]]), which is protected by four female camels, represented by [[Beta Draconis]], [[Gamma Draconis]], [[Nu Draconis]], and [[Xi Draconis]]. The nomads who own the camels are camped nearby, represented by a cooking tripod composed of [[Upsilon Draconis|Upsilon]], [[Tau Draconis|Tau]], and [[Sigma Draconis]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=239}} In some mythology, Draco had one hundred magnificent heads, guarded the golden apple tree, and was put in the sky as a constellation for protecting the apples with valor.  The constellation has been subject to many more myths, but ones that are obscure.\n\n=== Meteor showers ===\nThe [[February Eta Draconids]] is a meteor shower that was discovered on February 4, 2011. Observers noted six meteors with a common [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] in a short period. Its parent is a previously unknown [[long-period comet]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal = Sky & Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 24 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}</ref>\n\n== Namesakes ==\n\n[[USS Draco (AK-79)|''Draco'']] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe main character in the 1996 film ''[[Dragonheart]]'' gets his name from this constellation. The film also reveals that Draco is actually a dragon heaven, where dragons go when their time in this world is complete, and if they have upheld the oath of an ancient dragon to guard mankind, with dragons otherwise fading into nothing upon their deaths. At the conclusion of the film, Draco, the last dragon, ascends into the constellation after he sacrifices himself to destroy an evil king that he had saved years ago. This is further elaborated on in the sequel and prequel films that follow.\n\nThe [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation|Dragon Variation]] of the Sicilian Defense chess opening was also named after the constellation by Russian chess master [[Fyodor Dus-Chotimirsky]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Secrets of the Sicilian Dragon|last=Gufeld|first=Eduard|authorlink=Eduard Gufeld|date=June 1998|publisher=Cardoza Publishing|isbn=0-940685-92-2}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Beyblade (toy)|Beyblade]] top Lightning L-Drago 100HF and its evolutions Meteo L-Drago LW105LF and L-Drago Destructor F:S are inspired by/based on the Draco constellation.

Some have sponges or internal reservoirs that dispense holy water when shaken, while others must periodically be dipped in an '''aspersorium''' (holy water bucket, known to art historians as a [[situla (vessel)|situla]]).\n\n==Uses==\nAn aspergillum is used in [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] ceremonies, including the Rite of [[Baptism]] and during the [[Eastertide|Easter Season]]. In addition, a priest will use the aspergillum to bless the candles during [[candlemas]] services and the palms during [[Palm Sunday]] Mass. At a [[requiem]], if a coffin is present, the priest will sprinkle holy water on the coffin. The aspergillum can be used in other manners where sprinkling of holy water is appropriate, as in a house blessing, in which the priest might bless the entry to the home. The name derives from the [[Latin]] verb ''aspergere'' 'to sprinkle'.\n\nThe form of the aspergillum differs in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. In the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] the aspergillum (''randistirion'') is in the form of a standing vessel with a tapering lid. The top of the lid has holes in it from which the [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|''agiasmos'']] (holy water) is sprinkled. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] the aspergillum is in the form of a [[Fly-whisk|whisk]] made of cloth or hair. Sometimes, sprigs of [[basil]] are used to sprinkle holy water. In some of the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], no aspergillum is used, but the priest will pour holy water into the palm of his right hand and throw it on the faithful.\n\nAn aspergillum is also used in other religions, including Balinese [[Shaivism]] ([[Hinduism]]).\n\n==Origin==\nThe origin is found in the [[Book of Leviticus]] Chapter 14 in the [[Old Testament]]\u2013\n[[Image:Aspergillum by Julia O'Gara.jpg|thumb|Proto-aspergillum as described in Leviticus]]\n\n<blockquote>3. \u2018And the priest goes out of the camp and the priest looks, and beholds that the sore of the leprosy of the leper is healed.\u2019 4. \u2018And the priest commands, and takes, for the one healed, two unblemished live birds, cedar wood, Coccus scarlet, and hyssop.\u2019 5. \u2018And the priest commands, and slaughters the one bird in a pottery vessel upon living water.\u2019 6. \u2018He takes the live bird and the cedar wood and the Coccus scarlet and the hyssop and dips them and the live bird in the blood of the bird slaughtered upon the living water.\u2019 7. \u2018And sprinkle seven times upon him purified of leprosy, and he is purified, and sends the live bird upon the face of the field.'</blockquote>\n\nAdam Clarke's commentary: Of the cedar wood, hyssop, clean bird, and scarlet wool or fillet, were made an aspergillum, or instrument to sprinkle with.  The cedarwood served for the handle, the hyssop and living bird were attached to it, by means of the scarlet wool or crimson fillet.  The bird was so bound to this handle, as that its tail should be downwards, in order to be dipped in the blood of the bird that had been killed.  The whole of this made an instrument for the sprinkling of this blood, and when this business was done, the living bird was let loose, and permitted to go whithersoever it would.

C. I p. 529)\n\nFurther, these ceremonies conducted by the priest did not cure skin disease. According to [[The Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the diseased person came to the priest ''after'' he had been healed (Luke 5:14). The task of the priest was to make the person who had been excluded from the camp, from his people, and from God, ceremonially clean.
