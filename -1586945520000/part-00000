It also provided protection especially when entering inclined [[shaft mining|mineshaft]]s. Another advantage was that it stabilised the internal organs from mechanical shock and vibration by acting as a sort of [[kidney belt]]. The miner's apron was a triangular or, more rarely, semi-circular piece of leather and was supported by the [[belt (clothing)|body belt]]. In Germany the design of the modern miner's apron is governed by DIN standard 23307 ''Ges\u00e4\u00dfleder f\u00fcr den Bergbau (Arschleder)''.\n\n== History ==\nThe mining apron was introduced to German mining regions in the 15th century from the [[Slovakia]]n mining area around [[Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica|Schemnitz]] (Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica). Early illustrations of it are found on the title page of the \"Little Mining Book\" (''Bergb\u00fcchlein'') by [[Ulrich R\u00fclein von Calw]] (1505) and on the [[St. Anne's Church, Annaberg-Buchholz#Miners' altar|miner's altar of St. Anne's Church in Annaberg]] (1521). [[Georgius Agricola]] wrote in this book ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556):{{quotation|So sat the miners on their aprons, which were tied around their loins, and hung down behind them. <br />\n(''So sitzend die Bergh\u00e4wer auf ihr Arsleder, das um die Lenden gebunden, dahinter herabhanget.'')}}\n\nPermission to wear the miner's apron was only granted to miners and mining officials. Analogous to the [[hammer and chisel]], it represented a unifying symbol of miners' status. Later, it was also worn outside work in decorative styles as part of the [[miner's uniform]] (''Berghabit'') or parade uniform (''Paradeuniform'') for [[miners' parade]]s (''Bergparaden''). In events connected with mining [[customs]], this device is also used for the so-called \"leather jump\" (''Ledersprung''), a form of miners' initiation ceremony in Austria.\n\n== Folk art and music ==\nThe apron of the miner is incorporated into the design of the wooden [[smoking figurine]]s and [[nutcracker]]s made in the [[Ore Mountains]]. It has also made its way into the mining songs. Thus we read in the last stanza of the version of the mine foremen's song (''Steigerlied'') sung in the [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland|Saar]]: {{quotation|The mining folk are terribly good folk<br />because they wear the leather over their bum at night<br />because they wear the leather over their bum at night<br />and drink ''[[schnaps]]'', and drink ''schnaps''.<br />\n''Die Bergleut sein kreuzbrave Leut\u2019<br />denn sie tragen das Leder vor dem Arsch bei der Nacht<br />denn sie tragen das Leder vor dem Arsch bei der Nacht<br />und saufen Schnaps, und saufen Schnaps.''}}\n\n== Similar uses ==\nIn [[Kite|stunt kite flying]] the leather apron is used especially in [[power kiting]] or [[kite surfing]] using powered kites. The pilot sits on a leather apron that protects the seat of his trousers and is hauled by the kite over rough ground (e.g., pastureland).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Miner's habit]]\n* [[Miner's cap]]\n* [[Mooskappe]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* Walter Schellhas: ''Das Arschleder des Bergmanns'', in: [[S\u00e4chsische Heimatbl\u00e4tter]] Heft 6/1987, pp.&nbsp;280\u2013281\n* Carl Friedrich Richter: ''Neuestes Berg-und H\u00fctten-Lexikon.'' 1st Volume, Kleefeldsche Buchhandlung, Leipzig, 1805\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.jugendheim-gersbach.de/Schwazer-Bergbuch-Vorderoesterreich-Tirol-Bergknappe-Arschleder-Hunt.jpg Illustration of a miner with miner's apron (triangular type)]\n\n[[Category:History of mining]]\n[[Category:Mining culture and traditions]]\n[[Category:Medieval European costume]]\n[[Category:Protective gear]]\n[[Category:Miners' clothing]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Bergmannskostuem 13 Jh mit Arschleder und Bergeisen.jpg|thumb|150px|Miner's costume showing the miner's apron or ''Bergleder'']]\n[[File:Bergmann der auf dem Leder einfaert.png|thumb|upright|right|Miner entering a mine sitting on his apron (by Georg Agricola)]]\n[[File:Annaberger-Bergaltar2.jpg|thumb|Depiction of miners with aprons at the Annaberg Miners' Altar (1521)]]\n\nThe '''miner's apron''' ({{lang-de|Arschleder}}, ''Bergleder'' or ''Fahrleder'') is part of the clothing worn, especially historically,  by [[miner]]s in the [[mining]] industries of German-speaking Europe.

In Germany the design of the modern miner's apron is governed by DIN standard 23307 ''Ges\u00e4\u00dfleder f\u00fcr den Bergbau (Arschleder)''.\n\n== History ==\nThe mining apron was introduced to German mining regions in the 15th century from the [[Slovakia]]n mining area around [[Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica|Schemnitz]] (Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica). Early illustrations of it are found on the title page of the \"Little Mining Book\" (''Bergb\u00fcchlein'') by [[Ulrich R\u00fclein von Calw]] (1505) and on the [[St. Anne's Church, Annaberg-Buchholz#Miners' altar|miner's altar of St. Anne's Church in Annaberg]] (1521). [[Georgius Agricola]] wrote in this book ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556):{{quotation|So sat the miners on their aprons, which were tied around their loins, and hung down behind them. <br />\n(''So sitzend die Bergh\u00e4wer auf ihr Arsleder, das um die Lenden gebunden, dahinter herabhanget.'')}}\n\nPermission to wear the miner's apron was only granted to miners and mining officials. Analogous to the [[hammer and chisel]], it represented a unifying symbol of miners' status. Later, it was also worn outside work in decorative styles as part of the [[miner's uniform]] (''Berghabit'') or parade uniform (''Paradeuniform'') for [[miners' parade]]s (''Bergparaden''). In events connected with mining [[customs]], this device is also used for the so-called \"leather jump\" (''Ledersprung''), a form of miners' initiation ceremony in Austria.\n\n== Folk art and music ==\nThe apron of the miner is incorporated into the design of the wooden [[smoking figurine]]s and [[nutcracker]]s made in the [[Ore Mountains]]. It has also made its way into the mining songs. Thus we read in the last stanza of the version of the mine foremen's song (''Steigerlied'') sung in the [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland|Saar]]: {{quotation|The mining folk are terribly good folk<br />because they wear the leather over their bum at night<br />because they wear the leather over their bum at night<br />and drink ''[[schnaps]]'', and drink ''schnaps''.<br />\n''Die Bergleut sein kreuzbrave Leut\u2019<br />denn sie tragen das Leder vor dem Arsch bei der Nacht<br />denn sie tragen das Leder vor dem Arsch bei der Nacht<br />und saufen Schnaps, und saufen Schnaps.''}}\n\n== Similar uses ==\nIn [[Kite|stunt kite flying]] the leather apron is used especially in [[power kiting]] or [[kite surfing]] using powered kites. The pilot sits on a leather apron that protects the seat of his trousers and is hauled by the kite over rough ground (e.g., pastureland).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Miner's habit]]\n* [[Miner's cap]]\n* [[Mooskappe]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* Walter Schellhas: ''Das Arschleder des Bergmanns'', in: [[S\u00e4chsische Heimatbl\u00e4tter]] Heft 6/1987, pp.&nbsp;280\u2013281\n* Carl Friedrich Richter: ''Neuestes Berg-und H\u00fctten-Lexikon.'' 1st Volume, Kleefeldsche Buchhandlung, Leipzig, 1805\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.jugendheim-gersbach.de/Schwazer-Bergbuch-Vorderoesterreich-Tirol-Bergknappe-Arschleder-Hunt.jpg Illustration of a miner with miner's apron (triangular type)]\n\n[[Category:History of mining]]\n[[Category:Mining culture and traditions]]\n[[Category:Medieval costume]]\n[[Category:Protective gear]]\n[[Category:Miners' clothing]]\n", "name_user": "Fayenatic london", "label": "safe", "comment": "Moving fromCategory:Medieval costumetoCategory:Medieval European costumeusingCat-a-lot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miner%27s_apron"}

Its use developed in early [[medieval Europe]]. At many stages of medieval [[Christianity|Christian]] culture it was unseemly for a married woman to show her hair.

It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n== Development ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console.<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/> The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Cancelled ports ===\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>{{cite web|last=Radke|first=Christian|url=https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|title=Worms|website=planetvb.com|date=2020|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529195248/https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|archive-date=2019-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\n=== Expansion pack ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a.

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nuke.com/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|title=Sales of Worms skyrockets|work=[[Computer Game Review]]|publisher=[[Ziff-Davis]]|date=1996|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|archive-date=1996-10-18|url-status=live}}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=\"RG23\">{{cite magazine|last=Day|first=Ashley|title=The Making of... Worms|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=23|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|date=March 2006|pages=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n''Worms'' sharply divided critics. Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''[[Cannon Fodder (video game)|Cannon Fodder]]''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the 2007 game|Worms (2007 video game)|the 1983 game|Worms?}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{under construction|placedby=KGRAMR|nosection=yes}}\n{{in use}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title        = Worms\n| image        = Worms-win-cover.jpg\n| image_size   = 256px\n| caption      = \n| developer    = [[Team17]]\n| publisher    = [[Ocean Software]]\n| designer     = [[Andy Davidson (game designer)|Andy Davidson]]\n|composer      = [[Bj\u00f8rn Lynne]]\n| series       = ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]''\n| engine       = \n| released     = '''Amiga, CD32, Game Boy & Mac'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|1995<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}</ref><ref>[http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 Worms review from CU Amiga Magazine (Dec 1995) \u2013 Amiga Magazine Rack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220093731/http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 |date=2012-02-20 }}</ref>}}'''Mega Drive'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|June 1, 1995}}'''PC (DOS)'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|October 31, 1995 (Retail)|EU|1995|NA|October 19, 2011 (Steam)}}'''PlayStation'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|November, 1995<ref name=\"CTW565\">{{cite magazine |title=Christmas Games Guide |magazine=Computer Trade Weekly |location=United Kingdom |date=27 November 1995 |issue=565 |page=43 }}</ref>|JP|February 28, 1997}}'''SNES'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|September 29, 1996}}'''Saturn'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|1995|JP|March 14, 1997}}'''Jaguar'''<br />{{vgrelease|NA|May 15, 1998}}\n| genre        = [[Artillery game|Artillery]], [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]\n| modes        = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n| platforms    = [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[Atari Jaguar]], [[Mac OS]], [[IBM PC compatible]] ([[MS-DOS]]), [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]\n}}\n'''''Worms''''' is a 2D [[Artillery game|artillery]] [[Strategy video game|tactical]] video game developed by [[Team17]] and released in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]. It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n== Development ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console.<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/> The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Cancelled ports ===\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>{{cite web|last=Radke|first=Christian|url=https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|title=Worms|website=planetvb.com|date=2020|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529195248/https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|archive-date=2019-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\n=== Expansion pack ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a.

Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "name_user": "KGRAMR", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReception", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game)"}

He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.

He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.
