Rhee was also the first and last president of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] from 1919 to his impeachment in 1925 and from 1947 to 1948. As President of South Korea, [[First Republic of Korea|Rhee's government]] was characterised by [[authoritarianism]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], limited [[economic development]], strong [[anti-communism]] and by the late 1950s growing [[political instability]] and public opposition. He imbued the country with a tradition of authoritarian rule that lasted, with a few short breaks, until 1988.\n\nBorn in [[Hwanghae Province]], [[Joseon]], Rhee attended an American [[Methodist]] school, where he converted to [[Christianity]]. He became involved in [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese]] activities after the 1894\u201395 [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and was imprisoned in 1899. Released in 1904, he moved to the United States, where he obtained degrees from American universities and [[Treaty of Portsmouth#Portsmouth%20Peace%20Conference|met]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. After a brief 1910\u201312 return to Korea, he moved to [[Hawaii]] in 1913. From 1918 to 1924, he was promoted to several high positions in some Korean provisional governments and served as a representative of these to [[Western powers]]. He moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1939. In 1945, he was returned to [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|US-controlled Korea]] by the US military, and [[1948 South Korean Constitutional Assembly election|on 20 July 1948]] he was elected President of the Republic of Korea with 92.7% of the vote, beating [[Kim Koo]].\n\nRhee adopted a hardline anti-communist and pro-American stance as President. Early on in his presidency, his government put down an [[anti-imperialist]] [[Jeju uprising|uprising on Jeju Island]], and the [[Mungyeong Massacre|Mungyeong]] and [[Bodo League massacre|Bodo League massacres]] occurred against suspected [[communist]] sympathisers, leaving at least 100,000 people dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/south-korea-owns-up-to-brutal-past/2008/11/14/1226318928410.html|title=South Korea owns up to brutal past - World - smh.com.au|website=www.smh.com.au}}</ref> Rhee oversaw the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953), in which North Korea invaded the south.

After being [[1956 South Korean presidential election|re-elected in 1956]], the constitution was modified to remove the two-term restriction, despite protests from the opposition. He was elected uncontested [[March 1960 South Korean presidential election|in March 1960]], after his opponent [[Cho Byeong-ok]] died before voting day. After Rhee's ally [[Lee Ki-poong]] won the corresponding vice-presidential election by a wide margin, the opposition rejected the result as rigged, which triggered protests. These escalated into the student-led [[April Revolution]] when police shot demonstrators in [[Masan]], which forced Rhee to resign on 26 April and ultimately led to the establishment of the [[Second Republic of Korea]]. On 28 April, as protesters converged on the [[Blue House|presidential palace]], the [[CIA]] covertly flew him out to [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, where he spent the rest of his life in exile.

At this point, he was strongly [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] and opposed foreign intervention; he opposed [[Soviet Union]] and United States' proposal in the [[Moscow Conference (1945)]] to establish a trusteeship for Korea and the cooperation between the left-wing ([[Communism|communist]]) and the right-wing ([[Nationalism|nationalist]]) parties. He also refused to join the U.S.\u2013Soviet Cooperation Committee ({{Korean|labels=no |hangul=\ubbf8\uc18c\uacf5\ub3d9\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c |hanja=\u7f8e\u8607\u5171\u540c\u59d4\u54e1\u6703}}) as well as the negotiations with the north.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" />\n\nThe Korean nationalist movement had for decades been torn by factionalism and in-fighting, and most of the leaders of the independence movement hated each other as much as they hated the Japanese. Rhee, who had lived for decades in the United States, was a figure known only from afar in Korea, and therefore regarded as a more or less acceptable compromise candidate for the conservative factions. More importantly, Rhee spoke fluent English, whereas none of his rivals did, and therefore he was the Korean politician most trusted and favored by the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|American occupation government]]. The British diplomat [[Roger Makins, 1st Baron Sherfield|Roger Makins]] later recalled, \"the American propensity to go for a man rather than a movement \u2014 [[Henri Giraud|Giraud]] among the French in 1942, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in China. Americans have always liked the idea of dealing with a foreign leader who can be identified as 'their man'. They are much less comfortable with movements.\" Makins further added the same was the case with Rhee, as very few Americans were fluent in Korean in the 1940s or knew much about Korea, and it was simply far easier for the American occupation government to deal with Rhee than to try to understand Korea. Rhee was \"acerbic, prickly, unpromising\" and was regarded by the U.S. State Department, which long had dealings with him as \"a dangerous mischief-maker\", but the American General [[John R. Hodge]] decided that Rhee was the best man for the Americans to back because of his fluent English and his ability to talk with authority to American officers about American subjects. Once it became clear from October 1945 onward that Rhee was the Korean politician most favored by the Americans, other conservative leaders fell in behind him. Hastings wrote, \"In an Asian society, where politics are often dominated by an instinctive desire to fall in behind the strongest force, Rhee's backing from the military government was the decisive factor in his rise to power.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> \n \nWhen the first U.S.\u2013Soviet Cooperation Committee meeting was concluded without a result, he began to argue in June 1946 that the government of Korea must be established as an independent entity.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" /> In the same month, he created a plan based on this idea<ref name=\"Doopedia\" /> and moved to Washington, D.C. from December 1946 to April 1947 to [[Lobbying|lobby]] support for the plan.

There was much controversy between Rhee and his leftist opponents. Allegedly, many of the leftist opponents were arrested and in some cases killed. The most controversial issue has been [[Kim Gu]]'s assassination. On 26 June 1949, Kim Gu was assassinated by [[Ahn Doo-hee]], who confessed that he assassinated Kim Gu by the order of [[Kim Chang-ryong]].

By June 26, it was apparent that the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA) would occupy Seoul.

Citizens should not worry and remain in their workplaces.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2017/04/356_226873.html|title=Ten biggest lies in modern Korean history|date=April 3, 2017|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]}}</ref> However, Rhee had already left the city with most of his government on June 27. At midnight on June 28, the South Korean military destroyed the Han Bridge, thereby preventing thousands of citizens from fleeing.

A series of battles ensued, which would later be known collectively as the [[Battle of Naktong Bulge]]. After the [[Battle of Inchon]] in September 1950, the North Korean military was routed, and the [[United Nations]] (UN)\u2014of whom the largest contingents were the Americans and South Koreans\u2014not only liberated all of South Korea, but overran much of North Korea. In the areas of North Korea taken by the UN forces, elections were supposed to be administered by the United Nations but instead were taken over and administered by the South Koreans. Rhee insisted on ''Bukjin Tongil'' \u2013 ending war by conquering North Korea, but after the Chinese entered the war in November 1950, the UN forces were thrown into retreat.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kollontai|first=Ms Pauline|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FhAEmcLqrA8C&pg=PA111|title=Peace and Reconciliation: In Search of Shared Identity|last2=Kim|first2=Professor Sebastian C.

Both at the time and since, there has been much speculation about precisely how Rhee managed to live on a salary equivalent to $37.50 per month. The entire Rhee regime was notorious for its corruption, with everyone in the government from the President downwards stealing as much they possibly could from both the public purse and aid from the United States. The Rhee regime engaged in the \"worst excesses of corruption,\" with the soldiers in the Army of the Republic of Korea (ROK) going unpaid for months as their officers embezzled their pay, equipment provided by the United States being sold on the black market, and the size of the ROK army being bloated by hundreds of thousands of \"ghost soldiers\" who only existed on paper, allowing their officers to steal pay that would have been due had these soldiers actually existed. The problems with low morale experienced by the ROK army were largely due to the corruption of the Rhee regime. The worst scandal during the war\u2014indeed of the entire Rhee government\u2014was the [[National Defense Corps Incident]]. Rhee created the National Defense Corps in December 1950, intended to be a paramilitary militia, comprising men not in the military or police who be drafted into the corps for internal security duties. In the months that followed, thousands of National Defense Corps men either starved or froze to death in their unheated barracks, as the men lacked winter uniforms. Even Rhee could not ignore the deaths of so many of the National Defense Corps and ordered an investigation. It was revealed that commander of the National Defense Corps, General Kim Yun Gun, had stolen millions of American dollars that were intended to heat the barracks and feed and clothe the men. General Kim and five other officers were publicly shot at [[Daegu]] on August 12, 1951, following their convictions for corruption.<ref name=\"Hastings, Max page 236\">Hastings (1988), p. 235-240</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1951, Rhee\u2014who was upset about MacArthur's dismissal by President Truman\u2014lashed out in a press interview against Britain, whom he blamed for MacArthur's sacking.<ref name=\"Hastings, Max page 235\">Hastings (1988), p. 235</ref> Rhee was absolutely committed to reunifying Korea under his leadership and strongly supported MacArthur's call for going all-out against China, even at the risk of provoking a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Rhee declared, \"The British troops have outlived their welcome in my country.\" Shortly thereafter, Rhee told an Australian diplomat about the Australian troops fighting for his country, \"They are not wanted here any longer. Tell that to your government. The Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and British troops all represent a government which is now sabotaging the brave American effort to liberate fully and unify my unhappy nation.\"<ref name=\"Hastings, Max page 235\"/>\n\n[[File:Syngman Rhee-TIME-1953.jpg|left|thumb|Rhee on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover, 1953|alt=]]\n\nRhee was strongly against the armistice negotiations the U.S. entered into in 1953. Accordingly, in April of the same year, he demanded of President [[Eisenhower]] a total withdrawal of his troops from the peninsula if an armistice were to be signed, declaring that the ROK would rather fight on its own than negotiate a cease-fire. He also deliberately carried out some actions that would deter the armistice and reignite conflicts in the region, the most provocative one being his unilateral release of 25,000 prisoners of war in June 1953.<ref>Cha (2010), p. 174</ref> Such actions, which hindered the progress of armistice talks, upset China and the North. Moreover, for such unpredictability in his authoritarian leadership, the Truman and Eisenhower administrations considered him one of the \u201crogue allies\u201d in East Asia and engaged in \"[[Powerplay (theory)|powerplay]]\", or the construction of asymmetric alliances, which helped the U.S. maximize economic and political influence over the ROK and increase ROK's dependency on the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cha|first=Victor D|date=Winter 2010|title=Powerplay: Origins of the U.S. Alliance System in Asia|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.158#.WPcuFqIlHIU|journal=International Security|publisher=MIT Press Journals|volume=34|issue=3|pages=158\u2013196|doi=10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.158|ref=Cha (2010)}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 July 1953, at last, \"one of the 20th century's most vicious and frustrating wars\"<ref>James E.

Rhee was also the first and last president of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] from 1919 to his impeachment in 1925 and from 1947 to 1948. As President of South Korea, [[First Republic of Korea|Rhee's government]] was characterised by [[authoritarianism]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], limited [[economic development]], strong [[anti-communism]] and by the late 1950s growing [[political instability]] and public opposition. He imbued the country with a tradition of authoritarian rule that lasted, with a few short breaks, until 1988.\n\nBorn in [[Hwanghae Province]], [[Joseon]], Rhee attended an American [[Methodist]] school, where he converted to [[Christianity]]. He became involved in [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese]] activities after the 1894\u201395 [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and was imprisoned in 1899. Released in 1904, he moved to the United States, where he obtained degrees from American universities and [[Treaty of Portsmouth#Portsmouth%20Peace%20Conference|met]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. After a brief 1910\u201312 return to Korea, he moved to [[Hawaii]] in 1913. From 1918 to 1924, he was promoted to several high positions in some Korean provisional governments and served as a representative of these to [[Western powers]]. He moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1939. In 1945, he was returned to [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|US-controlled Korea]] by the US military, and [[1948 South Korean Constitutional Assembly election|on 20 July 1948]] he was elected President of the Republic of Korea with 92.7% of the vote, beating [[Kim Koo]].\n\nRhee adopted a hardline anti-communist and pro-American stance as President. Early on in his presidency, his government put down an [[anti-imperialist]] [[Jeju uprising|uprising on Jeju Island]], and the [[Mungyeong Massacre|Mungyeong]] and [[Bodo League massacre|Bodo League massacres]] occurred against suspected [[communist]] sympathisers, leaving at least 100,000 people dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/south-korea-owns-up-to-brutal-past/2008/11/14/1226318928410.html|title=South Korea owns up to brutal past - World - smh.com.au|website=www.smh.com.au}}</ref> Rhee oversaw the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953), in which North Korea invaded the south.

After being [[1956 South Korean presidential election|re-elected in 1956]], the constitution was modified to remove the two-term restriction, despite protests from the opposition. He was elected uncontested [[March 1960 South Korean presidential election|in March 1960]], after his opponent [[Cho Byeong-ok]] died before voting day. After Rhee's ally [[Lee Ki-poong]] won the corresponding vice-presidential election by a wide margin, the opposition rejected the result as rigged, which triggered protests. These escalated into the student-led [[April Revolution]] when police shot demonstrators in [[Masan]], which forced Rhee to resign on 26 April and ultimately led to the establishment of the [[Second Republic of Korea]]. On 28 April, as protesters converged on the [[Blue House|presidential palace]], the [[CIA]] covertly flew him out to [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, where he spent the rest of his life in exile.

At this point, he was strongly [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] and opposed foreign intervention; he opposed [[Soviet Union]] and United States' proposal in the [[Moscow Conference (1945)]] to establish a trusteeship for Korea and the cooperation between the left-wing ([[Communism|communist]]) and the right-wing ([[Nationalism|nationalist]]) parties. He also refused to join the U.S.\u2013Soviet Cooperation Committee ({{Korean|labels=no |hangul=\ubbf8\uc18c\uacf5\ub3d9\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c |hanja=\u7f8e\u8607\u5171\u540c\u59d4\u54e1\u6703}}) as well as the negotiations with the north.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" />\n\nThe Korean nationalist movement had for decades been torn by factionalism and in-fighting, and most of the leaders of the independence movement hated each other as much as they hated the Japanese. Rhee, who had lived for decades in the United States, was a figure known only from afar in Korea, and therefore regarded as a more or less acceptable compromise candidate for the conservative factions. More importantly, Rhee spoke fluent English, whereas none of his rivals did, and therefore he was the Korean politician most trusted and favored by the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|American occupation government]]. The British diplomat [[Roger Makins, 1st Baron Sherfield|Roger Makins]] later recalled, \"the American propensity to go for a man rather than a movement \u2014 [[Henri Giraud|Giraud]] among the French in 1942, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in China. Americans have always liked the idea of dealing with a foreign leader who can be identified as 'their man'. They are much less comfortable with movements.\" Makins further added the same was the case with Rhee, as very few Americans were fluent in Korean in the 1940s or knew much about Korea, and it was simply far easier for the American occupation government to deal with Rhee than to try to understand Korea. Rhee was \"acerbic, prickly, unpromising\" and was regarded by the U.S. State Department, which long had dealings with him as \"a dangerous mischief-maker\", but the American General [[John R. Hodge]] decided that Rhee was the best man for the Americans to back because of his fluent English and his ability to talk with authority to American officers about American subjects. Once it became clear from October 1945 onward that Rhee was the Korean politician most favored by the Americans, other conservative leaders fell in behind him. Hastings wrote, \"In an Asian society, where politics are often dominated by an instinctive desire to fall in behind the strongest force, Rhee's backing from the military government was the decisive factor in his rise to power.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> \n \nWhen the first U.S.\u2013Soviet Cooperation Committee meeting was concluded without a result, he began to argue in June 1946 that the government of Korea must be established as an independent entity.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\" /> In the same month, he created a plan based on this idea<ref name=\"Doopedia\" /> and moved to Washington, D.C. from December 1946 to April 1947 to [[Lobbying|lobby]] support for the plan.

Both at the time and since, there has been much speculation about precisely how Rhee managed to live on a salary equivalent to $37.50 per month. The entire Rhee regime was notorious for its corruption, with everyone in the government from the President downwards stealing as much they possibly could from both the public purse and aid from the United States. The Rhee regime engaged in the \"worst excesses of corruption,\" with the soldiers in the Army of the Republic of Korea (ROK) going unpaid for months as their officers embezzled their pay, equipment provided by the United States being sold on the black market, and the size of the ROK army being bloated by hundreds of thousands of \"ghost soldiers\" who only existed on paper, allowing their officers to steal pay that would have been due had these soldiers actually existed. The problems with low morale experienced by the ROK army were largely due to the corruption of the Rhee regime. The worst scandal during the war\u2014indeed of the entire Rhee government\u2014was the [[National Defense Corps Incident]]. Rhee created the National Defense Corps in December 1950, intended to be a paramilitary militia, comprising men not in the military or police who be drafted into the corps for internal security duties. In the months that followed, thousands of National Defense Corps men either starved or froze to death in their unheated barracks, as the men lacked winter uniforms. Even Rhee could not ignore the deaths of so many of the National Defense Corps and ordered an investigation. It was revealed that commander of the National Defense Corps, General Kim Yun Gun, had stolen millions of American dollars that were intended to heat the barracks and feed and clothe the men. General Kim and five other officers were publicly shot at [[Daegu]] on August 12, 1951, following their convictions for corruption.<ref name=\"Hastings, Max page 236\">Hastings (1988), p. 235-240</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1951, Rhee\u2014who was upset about MacArthur's dismissal by President Truman\u2014lashed out in a press interview against Britain, whom he blamed for MacArthur's sacking.<ref name=\"Hastings, Max page 235\">Hastings (1988), p. 235</ref> Rhee was absolutely committed to reunifying Korea under his leadership and strongly supported MacArthur's call for going all-out against China, even at the risk of provoking a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Rhee declared, \"The British troops have outlived their welcome in my country.\" Shortly thereafter, Rhee told an Australian diplomat about the Australian troops fighting for his country, \"They are not wanted here any longer. Tell that to your government. The Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and British troops all represent a government which is now sabotaging the brave American effort to liberate fully and unify my unhappy nation.\"<ref name=\"Hastings, Max page 235\"/>\n\n[[File:Syngman Rhee-TIME-1953.jpg|left|thumb|Rhee on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover, 1953|alt=]]\n\nRhee was strongly against the armistice negotiations the U.S. entered into in 1953. Accordingly, in April of the same year, he demanded of President [[Eisenhower]] a total withdrawal of his troops from the peninsula if an armistice were to be signed, declaring that the ROK would rather fight on its own than negotiate a cease-fire. He also deliberately carried out some actions that would deter the armistice and reignite conflicts in the region, the most provocative one being his unilateral release of 25,000 prisoners of war in June 1953.<ref>Cha (2010), p. 174</ref> Such actions, which hindered the progress of armistice talks, upset China and the North. Moreover, for such unpredictability in his authoritarian leadership, the Truman and Eisenhower administrations considered him one of the \u201crogue allies\u201d in East Asia and engaged in \"[[Powerplay (theory)|powerplay]]\", or the construction of asymmetric alliances, which helped the U.S. maximize economic and political influence over the ROK and increase ROK's dependency on the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cha|first=Victor D|date=Winter 2010|title=Powerplay: Origins of the U.S. Alliance System in Asia|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.158#.WPcuFqIlHIU|journal=International Security|publisher=MIT Press Journals|volume=34|issue=3|pages=158\u2013196|doi=10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.158|ref=Cha (2010)}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 July 1953, at last, \"one of the 20th century's most vicious and frustrating wars\"<ref>James E.

To circumvent this, Rhee attempted to amend the constitution to allow him to hold elections for the presidency by direct popular vote. When the Assembly rejected this amendment, Rhee ordered a mass arrest of opposition politicians and then passed the desired amendment in July 1952.

It should not be given to anyone with a family history of [[short QT syndrome]]. It has not been tested in children.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>\n\nIn preclinical studies, isavuconazonium caused birth defects; it has not been tested in pregnant women. Women who are pregnant should not take it and women taking it should not get pregnant. It is excreted in breast milk so people should not breast feed while taking it.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>\n\n==Side effects==\nCommon adverse effects (occurring in between 1 and 10% of people) include [[hypokalaemia|low potassium]], decreased appetite, delirium, headache, sleepiness, [[thrombophlebitis|vein inflammation]], difficulty breathing, acute respiratory failure, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, elevated results in [[liver function tests]], rash, itchy skin, kidney failure, chest pain, and fatigue. There are several uncommon side effects as well.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>\n\n== Interactions ==\n\nIsavuconazonium is converted into isavuconazole inside the body, and isavuconazole is a substrate for [[CYP3A4]] or [[CYP3A5]]. Many other medications inhibit or induce those two enzymes, and isavuconazonium should not be administered with them. Inducers result in levels of isavuconazole that are too low and won't work, and inhibitors can cause high levels of isavuconazole which will in turn cause increased adverse events and toxicity. Likewise isavuconazonium can interfere with appropriate dosing of other drugs that are substrates for those enzymes.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>\n\nIn addition, isavuconazole induces [[CYP2B6]] and can decrease the amount of drugs that are metabolized by the enzyme. Isavuconazole inhibits [[P-glycoprotein]] (P-gp), [[BCRP]], [[SLC22A2]], and [[UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1|uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases]], each of which remove drugs from circulation; isavuconazonium will increase the amount of drugs that are affected by those proteins and may increase their toxicities.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>\n\n==Pharmacology==\nAfter oral or IV administration, isavuconazonium is rapidly hydrolysed by [[esterase]]s in blood or the [[gastrointestinal tract]] to the active form, isavuconazole.<ref name=UKlabel2017/><ref name=Pettit2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pettit NN, Carver PL | title = Isavuconazole: A New Option for the Management of Invasive Fungal Infections | journal = The Annals of Pharmacotherapy | volume = 49 | issue = 7 | pages = 825\u201342 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25940222 | doi = 10.1177/1060028015581679 | url = http://aop.sagepub.com/content/49/7/825 }}</ref>\n\nIsavuconazole works by [[enzyme inhibition|inhibition]] of [[lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase]], the [[enzyme]] responsible for converting [[lanosterol]] to [[ergosterol]] by [[demethylation]].

It should not be given to anyone with a family history of [[short QT syndrome]]. It has not been tested in children.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>\n\nIn preclinical studies, isavuconazonium caused birth defects; it has not been tested in pregnant women. Women who are pregnant should not take it and women taking it should not get pregnant. It is excreted in breast milk so people should not breast feed while taking it.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>\n\n==Side effects==\nCommon adverse effects (occurring in between 1 and 10% of people) include [[hypokalaemia|low potassium]], decreased appetite, delirium, headache, sleepiness, [[thrombophlebitis|vein inflammation]], difficulty breathing, acute respiratory failure, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, elevated results in [[liver function tests]], rash, itchy skin, kidney failure, chest pain, and fatigue. There are several uncommon side effects as well.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>\n\n== Interactions ==\n\nIsavuconazonium is converted into isavuconazole inside the body, and isavuconazole is a substrate for [[CYP3A4]] or [[CYP3A5]]. Many other medications inhibit or induce those two enzymes, and isavuconazonium should not be administered with them. Inducers result in levels of isavuconazole that are too low and won't work, and inhibitors can cause high levels of isavuconazole which will in turn cause increased adverse events and toxicity. Likewise isavuconazonium can interfere with appropriate dosing of other drugs that are substrates for those enzymes.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>\n\nIn addition, isavuconazole induces [[CYP2B6]] and can decrease the amount of drugs that are metabolized by the enzyme. Isavuconazole inhibits [[P-glycoprotein]] (P-gp), [[BCRP]], [[SLC22A2]], and [[UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1|uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases]], each of which remove drugs from circulation; isavuconazonium will increase the amount of drugs that are affected by those proteins and may increase their toxicities.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>\n\n==Pharmacology==\nAfter oral or IV administration, isavuconazonium is rapidly hydrolysed by [[esterase]]s in blood or the [[gastrointestinal tract]] to the active form, isavuconazole.<ref name=UKlabel2017/><ref name=Pettit2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pettit NN, Carver PL | title = Isavuconazole: A New Option for the Management of Invasive Fungal Infections | journal = The Annals of Pharmacotherapy | volume = 49 | issue = 7 | pages = 825\u201342 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25940222 | doi = 10.1177/1060028015581679 | url = http://aop.sagepub.com/content/49/7/825 }}</ref>\n\nIsavuconazole works by [[enzyme inhibition|inhibition]] of [[lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase]], the [[enzyme]] responsible for converting [[lanosterol]] to [[ergosterol]] by [[demethylation]].

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the [[Force Publique]] fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}\n[[File:Monument Albert Kinshasa 5.JPG|thumb|Colonial officials, including the Governor-General, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]], in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1938.]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the [[Belgian Congo]], which it had controlled since its annexation of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=Larousse1>{{cite web|title=Empire Colonial Belge|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Empire_colonial_belge/182725|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions Larousse]]|work=Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time.<ref name=Killingray7>{{cite book|last=Killingray|first=David|title=Fighting for Britain: African soldiers in the Second World War|year=2010|publisher=James Currey|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1-84701-015-5|page=7}}</ref> The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The [[Great Depression]] led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment.

[[Nazi Germany]] invaded Belgium on 10 May 1940 which, after [[Battle of Belgium|18 days of fighting]], surrendered and was [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupied]] by German forces.

The British government refused, wanting to ensure that the Congo would not fall under German control, and France followed suit. The French government briefly considered sending troops to occupy [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=122}} On the day of the Belgian Army's surrender, the British government, uncertain about what would happen to the territory, held a crisis meeting in London. The [[Admiralty]] proposed sending troops to occupy strategic locations in the Congo, but this was quickly ruled unfeasible due to other military commitments. The British government then resolved that if the Belgian government collapsed, it would support an \"independent\" Congo.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nWithin the Congo itself, opinion was divided on whether or not to continue to support the war. Belgian corporate officials hoped that the colony would take a neutral stance, and the staff of the [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, recommended a declaration of neutrality or even independence under the authority of the [[List of colonial governors of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo|Governor-General of the Congo]], [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Ryckmans refused to take this advice,{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=127}} and declared on the day of the Belgian Army's surrender that the colony would remain loyal to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref name=Urome>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=L'Histoire du Congo vue par les Coloniaux|publisher=Urome.be|url=http://www.urome.be/pdf/fhisconbe.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Despite this assurance, disruption broke out in the city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future of the colony and the threat of an Italian invasion.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOn 17 June France declared an armistice with Germany. Though Ryckmans had declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72, 231}} Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]] believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}} Meanwhile, some circles in occupied Belgium feared that if the Congo aligned itself with the Allies it would be permanently lost as a colony to Belgium. In Brussels, the Germans established a \"Kolonial Politisches B\u00fcro\" that attempted to forge connections with what remained of the Ministry of Colonies.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=81}} On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}}  The government agreed to the idea, and on 18 June it passed a law-decree, granting de Vleeschauwer the title and conferring on him full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo. The decree also stipulated that in the event the administrator-general was unable to exercise his duties, the responsibility would be passed on to the governor-general.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=123, 132}}\n\nDe Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}} He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the [[Belgian government in exile]], recognised by the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Despite his presence, de Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister [[Camille Gutt]] and played little role thereafter in the government.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=237\u2013238}} There was also conflict between de Vleeschauwer, who wanted to assure his own authority over the Congo, and Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] who sought to be more conciliatory with regard to Allied influence in the colony.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=131}}\n\nThe Germans were upset by the Congo's support for the Allies, and threatened to apply sanctions to Belgian colonial enterprises. Leopold III expressed his discontent with Ryckman's decisions, believing that the colony should remain neutral.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=128}} Royalist politicians sent messages to the Belgian authorities in London, attempting to dissuade them from allowing the Congo to support the British war effort. In October 1940 Leopold III requested permission from Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] to dispatch an emissary to L\u00e9opoldville to persuade the colonial administration to assume neutrality, but the trip was never authorised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\n==Economic contribution==\n=== Allied support ===\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"The Belgian Congo has entered the service of the Allies.

Business leaders in the colony were disgruntled as well, and boosted production of goods not mentioned in the agreement to sell to the neutral United States at their standard market value.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=235}} In 1942, after the United States joined the Allies, the Belgian government negotiated a new economic agreement with the United States and United Kingdom.

Most Congolese diamonds were mined by [[Formini\u00e8re]], a subsidiary of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique]], which was in turn a member of the [[De Beers]] Diamond Syndicate. In 1940, the Syndicate reported that the Congo annually produced 10.9 million carats of diamonds. Immediately after the outbreak of war reported production sharply declined, and by 1942 production had officially fallen to 5 million carats\u2013roughly the original production number minus the amount exported to Germany before the war. Believing that a large volume of diamonds were being smuggled out of the colony, American intelligence officials convinced British agents to inspect the security of the mines. The officer tasked with overseeing the inspection teams concluded that proper security measures were lacking and that Formini\u00e8re and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mini\u00e8re de Beceka]] personnel fostered a \"sinister atmosphere\" during the tours.{{sfn|Farrell-Robert|2007|loc=Chapter 7 - Diamonds for Hitler}} Firmin van Bree, the director of Formini\u00e8re, was widely suspected of maintaining German sympathies.{{sfn|Farrell-Robert|2007|loc=Chapter 7 - Diamonds for Hitler}}{{sfn|Williams|2018|p=50}} The German government conducted secret negotiations with leaders of Formini\u00e8re and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and reached deals that allowed them to purchase large quantities of diamonds until 1944. In 1943 Germany paid the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale $10.5 million for diamonds. American and British agents ultimately uncovered a wide smuggling network that brought diamonds out of the Congo and to German-occupied Europe by air and sea. Proposals by the Americans to stifle the illicit trade were dissuaded by the British [[Ministry of Economic Warfare]], whose Diamond Committee was dominated by members of the De Beers Diamond Syndicate. After the end of the war the Belgian government demanded that Germany pay $25 million owed to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale for 576,676 carats of diamonds.{{sfn|Farrell-Robert|2007|loc=Chapter 7 - Diamonds for Hitler}}\n\n==Military involvement==\n=== Force Publique ===\n[[File:Belgian Congo enlisting for the Force Publique.jpg|thumb|275px|Congolese enlisting in the Force Publique following the outbreak of war]]\nThe [[Force Publique]] (or \"Public Force\") was the combined police and military force of both the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi.

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the [[Force Publique]] fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}\n[[File:Monument Albert Kinshasa 5.JPG|thumb|Colonial officials, including the Governor-General, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]], in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1938.]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the [[Belgian Congo]], which it had controlled since its annexation of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=Larousse1>{{cite web|title=Empire Colonial Belge|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Empire_colonial_belge/182725|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions Larousse]]|work=Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time.<ref name=Killingray7>{{cite book|last=Killingray|first=David|title=Fighting for Britain: African soldiers in the Second World War|year=2010|publisher=James Currey|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1-84701-015-5|page=7}}</ref> The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The [[Great Depression]] led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment.

The British government refused, wanting to ensure that the Congo would not fall under German control, and France followed suit. The French government briefly considered sending troops to occupy [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=122}} On the day of the Belgian Army's surrender, the British government, uncertain about what would happen to the territory, held a crisis meeting in London. The [[Admiralty]] proposed sending troops to occupy strategic locations in the Congo, but this was quickly ruled unfeasible due to other military commitments. The British government then resolved that if the Belgian government collapsed, it would support an \"independent\" Congo.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nWithin the Congo itself, opinion was divided on whether or not to continue to support the war. Belgian corporate officials hoped that the colony would take a neutral stance, and the staff of the [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, recommended a declaration of neutrality or even independence under the authority of the [[List of colonial governors of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo|Governor-General of the Congo]], [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Ryckmans refused to take this advice,{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=127}} and declared on the day of the Belgian Army's surrender that the colony would remain loyal to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref name=Urome>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=L'Histoire du Congo vue par les Coloniaux|publisher=Urome.be|url=http://www.urome.be/pdf/fhisconbe.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Despite this assurance, disruption broke out in the city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future of the colony and the threat of an Italian invasion.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOn 17 June France declared an armistice with Germany. Though Ryckmans had declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72, 231}} Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]] believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}} Meanwhile, some circles in occupied Belgium feared that if the Congo aligned itself with the Allies it would be permanently lost as a colony to Belgium. In Brussels, the Germans established a \"Kolonial Politisches B\u00fcro\" that attempted to forge connections with what remained of the Ministry of Colonies.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=81}} On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}}  The government agreed to the idea, and on 18 June it passed a law-decree, granting de Vleeschauwer the title and conferring on him full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo.

Most Congolese diamonds were mined by [[Formini\u00e8re]], a subsidiary of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique]], which was in turn a member of the [[De Beers]] Diamond Syndicate. In 1940, the Syndicate reported that the Congo annually produced 10.9 million carats of diamonds. Immediately after the outbreak of war reported production sharply declined, and by 1942 production had officially fallen to 5 million carats\u2013roughly the original production number minus the amount exported to Germany before the war. Believing that a large volume of diamonds were being smuggled out of the colony, American intelligence officials convinced British agents to inspect the security of the mines.

In 1943 Germany paid the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale $10.5 million for diamonds. American and British agents ultimately uncovered a wide smuggling network that brought diamonds out of the Congo and to German-occupied Europe by air and sea. Proposals by the Americans to stifle the illicit trade were dissuaded by the British [[Ministry of Economic Warfare]], whose Diamond Committee was dominated by members of the De Beers Diamond Syndicate.
