This would be one of the causes for the declaration of [[Independence of Brazil|Brazilian independence]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil]] in 1822, following a liberal revolution in Portugal.\n\nThe liberal period was stormy and short as [[Miguel of Portugal]] (Pedro's brother) supported an [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] revolution endeavoring to restore all power to the monarchy. Pedro eventually returned to Portugal and fought and defeated his brother in the [[Liberal Wars]] in which [[liberalism]] prevailed and Portugal became a constitutional monarchy.\n\n==Queen Maria I==\n[[Image:Rainha D. Maria I, s\u00e9c. XVIII,.jpg|thumb|left|125px|The Infanta Maria Francisca, ascended the throne to reign as Queen Maria I]]\n[[Image:O marques de pombal, conde de Oeiras.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Marquis of Pombal, Queen Maria's nemesis, who was dismissed and exiled]]\nThe death of [[Joseph I of Portugal|King Joseph]] in 1777 forced the accession of Princess [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria Francisca]], his eldest daughter, to the throne of Portugal; she succeeded her father as the first [[Queen regnant]] of the 650-year-old country, which was still recovering from the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]. Before becoming queen, Princess Maria and her husband, the [[Pedro III of Portugal|Infante Pedro]], lived on the sidelines of politics, but were clearly unsympathetic to her father's former Prime Minister, [[Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo]], the [[Marquis of Pombal]], who had been the ''de facto'' ruler of the kingdom for the past 27 years.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.260</ref><ref name=\"Marcus Cheke 1969, p.3\">Marcus Cheke (1969), p.3</ref> During her father's last few years, she had been the Marquis' fiercest detractor; once in power, she eagerly dismissed him and then exiled him to [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]].<ref>Her dislike for Pombal was so great that she issued one of the world's earliest [[restraining order]]s, commanding that Pombal should never be closer than {{convert|32|km|mi}} to her; in situations where the Queen was close to his estates, he was compelled to remove himself from his house to fulfill the royal decree. She is also reported to have had tantrums at the slightest reference to her father's former Prime Minister.</ref>\n\nAlthough the queen retained many of the Marquis' other ministers, she restored most of the privileges of the nobility and clergy, and released many of Pombal's political prisoners.<ref name=\"Marcus Cheke 1969, p.3\"/><ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.260-261</ref> The economy was reorganized and Pombaline monopolies were abandoned. However, international conditions favored the economic situation in Portugal as the balance of trade was positive, helped by wine exports and a decrease of British imports.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.261</ref> The period was, while tainted by political instability, a time of cultural renovation, marked by the completion of the [[Queluz National Palace|Palace at Queluz]], the beginnings of the [[Ajuda National Palace|Ajuda Palace]], the [[Teatro Nacional de S\u00e3o Carlos|S\u00e3o Carlos Theatre]], the [[Estrela Basilica]] and the immense [[Convent of Santa Clara, Vila do Conde|Convent of Santa Clara]] in [[Vila do Conde]].<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.262-263</ref>\n\nIn 1789, the [[French Revolution]] caused great social upheaval in Europe. The eventual Portuguese reaction was to land forces in [[Catalonia]], and together with the [[Spain|Spanish]] forces attack the [[France|French]] in the [[Pyrenees]] in the [[War of the Pyrenees|War of Roussillon]] (1794).<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.263</ref> The war did not go well, and by 1795, Spain had privately sued for peace, signed an alliance and aligned its external politics against [[Great Britain]].<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.264\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.264</ref> Even as Portugal was politically divided between continuing its old alliance with Britain, its people were also divided. The French Revolution, as seen by intellectuals and progressives, was romanticized: [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage|Bocage]] and the ''Partido Franc\u00eas'' (French Party) believed the French could usher in a liberal revolution in Europe. The French represented a threat to the traditionalist nobility who were returning to prominence and were very willing to fight them externally or internally.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.264\"/>\n\nIt was at about this time that Queen Maria, already possessed of a religious mania, began to show signs of mental illness.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.265\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.265</ref>  When after 1799 she became incapable of handling state affairs, her son, [[Infante]] [[John VI of Portugal|John of Braganza]], began to use the title of [[regent|Prince-Regent]]. The traditionalist adversaries of France, however, did not look to John, but rather to his wife [[Carlota of Spain|Carlota Joaquina]] for support, and at one point attempted a coup against the prince.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.265\"/>\n\n==Continental blockade==\nJohn VI's regency was a complex political period that saw Portugal attempting to remain neutral in spite of the combative intransigence of its neighbors and contentious forces within the country that favored either liberal or traditional policies. Between 1795 and 1801, his government struggled to maintain a delicate balance of peace in the face of the French [[Continental System|Continental blockade]] against Portugal's traditional ally, Great Britain, and the demands of the merchant classes who were prospering economically and wanted peace.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.265\"/> Meanwhile, Spain, a former ally, had signed the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso]], and was under pressure from France to coerce Portugal's cooperation, even if it required an invasion. Although [[Manuel de Godoy, Prince of the Peace|Manuel de Godoy]] was initially hesitant to invade Portugal, due to the royal family having relatives in both countries, the French remained anxious to break the [[Anglo-Portuguese alliance]] in order to close Portuguese ports to British shipping.<ref>CUP (1970), p.386-389</ref>\n\n===War of the Oranges===\n{{main|War of the Oranges}}\n[[Image:Manuel de Godoy, por Antonio Carnicero (Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando).jpg|thumb|125px|[[Manuel de Godoy, Prince of the Peace|Manuel de Godoy]], as pictured in a portrait by [[Antonio Carnicero]] in 1790]]\n[[Image:Duke of Lafoes.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Jo\u00e3o Carlos de Bragan\u00e7a (Duke de Laf\u00f5es)|Jo\u00e3o Carlos de Bragan\u00e7a e Ligne]] (2nd [[Duke of Laf\u00f5es]], who was responsible for the defense of Portugal during the disaster of the ''War of the Oranges'']]\nOn 29 January 1801, an ultimatum from Spain and France forced Portugal to decide between France and Britain, even as its government had tried to negotiate favorable relations with the two powers rather than abrogate the [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)]].<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.265\"/> The French sent a five-point statement to [[Lisbon]] demanding that Portugal:<ref name=\"H.V.Livermore 1976, p.247\">H.V.Livermore (1976), p.247</ref>\n* abandon its traditional alliance with [[Great Britain]] and close its ports to British shipping;\n* open its ports to [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] shipping;\n* surrender one or more of its provinces, equal to one fourth part of her total area, as a guarantee for the recovery of [[Trinidad]], Port Mahon ([[Menorca]]) and [[Malta]];\n* pay a war indemnity to France and Spain;\n* review border limits with Spain.\nIf Portugal failed to accomplish the five conditions of this ultimatum, it would be invaded by Spain, supported by 15,000 French soldiers. The British could not promise any effective relief, even as [[John VI of Portugal|Prince John]] appealed to [[John Hookham Frere|Hookham Frere]], who arrived in November 1800. In February, the terms were delivered to the Prince-Regent; although he sent a negotiator to Madrid, war was declared. At the time, Portugal had a poorly trained army, with less than 8,000 cavalry and 46,000 infantry troops. Its military commander, [[Jo\u00e3o Carlos de Bragan\u00e7a (Duke de Laf\u00f5es)|Jo\u00e3o Carlos de Bragan\u00e7a e Ligne]] (2nd [[Duke of Laf\u00f5es]]), had barely raised 2,000 horse and 16,000 troops.<ref>H.V.

The Spanish army quickly penetrated the [[Alentejo]] region in southern Portugal and occupied [[Olivenza|Oliven\u00e7a]], [[Juromenha]], [[Arronches]], [[Portalegre, Portugal|Portalegre]], [[Castelo de Vide]], [[Barbacena]] and [[Ouguela]] without resistance. [[Campo Maior, Portugal|Campo Maior]] resisted for 18 days before falling to the Spanish army, but [[Elvas Municipality|Elvas]] successfully resisted a siege by the invaders. An episode which occurred during the siege of Elvas accounts for the name, \"War of the Oranges\": Godoy, celebrating his first experience of generalship, plucked two oranges from a tree and immediately sent them to Queen [[Maria Luisa of Parma|Maria Luisa]] of Spain, mother of [[Carlota Joaquina]] and supposedly his lover,<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.265\"/> with the message:\n{{quote|text=I lack everything, but with nothing I will go to Lisbon.|sign=Manuel de Godoy<ref name=\"H.V.Livermore 1976, p.247\"/>}}\n\nThe conflict ended quickly when the defeated and demoralized Portuguese were forced to negotiate and accept the stipulations of the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)|Treaty of Badajoz]], signed on June 6, 1801.<ref name=\"H.V.Livermore 1976, p.247\"/> As part of the peace settlement, Portugal recovered all of the strongholds previously conquered by the Spanish, with the exception of Oliven\u00e7a and other territories on the eastern margin of the [[Guadiana]], and a prohibition of contraband was enforced near the border between the two countries. The treaty was ratified by the Prince-Regent on 14 June, while the [[King of Spain]] promulgated the treaty on 21 June.\n\nA special convention (i.e., the [[Treaty of Madrid (1801)|Treaty of Madrid]]) on 29 September 1801 made additions to that of Badajoz whereby Portugal was forced to pay [[France]] an indemnity of 20 million [[francs]].<ref name=\"Fournier1903\">{{cite book|author=August Fournier|title=Napoleon the First: A Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/napoleonfirstab00fourgoog|year=1903|publisher=H.

In this pact, [[Kingdom of Northern Lusitania|Northern Lusitania]], a territory between the [[Minho River|Minho]] and [[Douro]] rivers, would be a principality governed by the sovereign of the extinct [[Kingdom of Etruria]] (then Maria Luisa, daughter of [[Charles IV of Spain]]). The [[Algarve]] and all Portuguese territory located south of the [[Tagus]] would be governed by [[Manuel de Godoy]], in compensation for his role in bringing the Spanish to align with France. The rest of Portugal, the area between the Douro and the Tagus, a strategic region because of its ports, would be administered by the central government in France until a general peace.

Approximately 10,000 people, including the entire governmental administration and the judiciary, joined the royal family as they moved to Brazil, a possession of Portugal, and established the capital of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n===First invasion===\n[[File:Arthur Wellesley by John Hoppner.jpg|thumb|upright|The young [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] disembarked in [[Galiza]] to support the Spanish, but was responsible for defeating Junot's forces]]\nGeneral [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] and his troops had entered Spain on 18 October 1807 and crossed the [[Iberian peninsula|peninsula]] to reach the Portuguese border. Junot encountered no resistance and reached [[Abrantes]] by 24 November, [[Santar\u00e9m, Portugal|Santar\u00e9m]] on 28 November, and the Portuguese [[Lisbon|capital]] at the end of the month, arriving a day after the [[Royal court|Court]] had fled to Brazil. Before the Prince Regent departed, he left orders with the Regency [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Junta]] to greet the French in peace.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.267</ref> Once he arrived, Junot promoted himself as a reformer come to liberate the oppressed people of Portugal, promising progress, the construction of roads and canals, efficient administration, clean finances, assistance and schools for the poor.<ref name=\"CUP 1970, p.396\"/><ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.268</ref> Instead, he set about removing vestiges of the Portuguese monarchy, declared that the [[House of Braganza]] had ceased to reign in Portugal, suspended the Council of Regency, suppressed the Portuguese militia, billeted officers in the finest houses of the rich, and plundered the Portuguese treasury for continuing reparations to the French.<ref>CUP (1970), p.397</ref> Meanwhile, 50,000 Spanish and French troops roamed the countryside arresting, killing, plundering and raping the citizenry.<ref>James Maxwell Anderson (2000), p.127</ref>\n\nBy 1808, as Junot was busy redesigning Portuguese society, Napoleon decided to revise his alliance with Spain; he forced the abdication of Charles IV of Spain and his son [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand]], and installed his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] as King.

With winter quickly approaching, his forces starving, they were again defeated at the [[Battle of Redinha]] and with Anglo-Portuguese forces in pursuit, Massena crossed the border into Spain; the War would continue until March 1814, but not on Portuguese territory.<ref name=\"James Maxwell Anderson 2000 p.129\"/>\n\nA series of battles in Spain followed, until a final victory was reached on French soil in the [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Battle of Toulouse]] on April 10, 1814, putting an end to the Peninsular War. However, in numerous coastal, interior and border towns there were bodies bayoneted and left on the ground; several frontier towns were pillaged and ransacked for treasure or vandalized by retreating troops (both British and French); reprisal killings were common in the local populations for sympathizers (the total number of casualties in the war reached 100,000 by one account);<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.270\"/> while famine and social deprivation was common.<ref name=\"James Maxwell Anderson 2000 p.129\"/>\n\nFurthermore, the instability in Spain and the abdication of the king, resulted in declarations of independence in the Spanish colonies of [[Americas|America]], which in turn was responsible for a tense political climate in Brazil.\n\nIn 1816, and as a result of the increasing influence of the [[Liga Federal]], the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] invaded and conquered the [[Banda Oriental]], annexing it under the name of [[Cisplatina|Prov\u00edncia Cisplatina]] in 1821.\n\n==Liberal Revolution==\n[[File:Flag of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves.svg|thumb|left|235px|Flag of the ''[[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]'' (1816\u20131826)]]\n[[Image:William Carr Beresford, Viscount Beresford by Sir William Beechey (2).jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[William Carr Beresford]], who administered mainland Portugal during the post-[[Peninsular War]] period]]\nFrom 1808 through 1821, Portugal was effectively both a British [[protectorate]] and a colony of Brazil, as the [[King of Portugal|Portuguese Crown]] remained in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name=\"James Maxwell Anderson 2000 p.129\"/> The moving of the Portuguese capital to [[Rio de Janeiro]] accentuated the economic, institutional and social crises in mainland Portugal, which was administered by English commercial and military interests under William Beresford's rule in the absence of the monarch. The influence of [[Liberalism|liberal ideals]]<ref name=\"James Maxwell Anderson 2000 p.129\"/> was strengthened by the aftermath of the war, the continuing impact of the American and French revolutions, discontent under absolutist government, and the general indifference shown by the Portuguese regency for the plight of its people.\n\nAfter 1807 the limitations and subordinations inherent in Brazil's colonial status were already being reduced incrementally. The prohibition on transformative industries was rescinded, and new incentives were offered for: the creation of factories, the importation of British machinery, ship construction, and road building, as well as the foundation and construction of public schools and military academies. In addition to these improvements, the Bank of Brazil was chartered and insurance companies, commerce commissions and currency exchanges were established. This damaged the mother country's commercial interests and aggravated social problems there, while benefiting the United Kingdom, as Portugal was governed by the increasingly despotic British general [[William Carr Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] in the absence of the Cortes.<ref name=British_domination>[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/spain/britport.html Portugal under British Protection], 1808\u20131814</ref><ref name=open_of_Brazil>Louise Guenther, \"[http://www.lac.ox.ac.uk/sites/sias/files/documents/Guenther32.pdf The British community of 19th century Bahia: public and private lives]\"</ref>\n\nAt the end of the [[Peninsular War]], Portugal returned [[French Guiana]] (which had been seized in 1809) to France on 30 May 1814.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Map of Europe by Treaty: Showing the Various Political and Territorial Changes which Have Taken Place Since the General Peace of 1814; with Numerous Maps and Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ABDAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA269|year=1875|publisher=Gregg International|page=269}}</ref> With the declaration by King John of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] in December 1815,<ref name=\"Taylor2005\">{{cite book|author=Gerard Taylor|title=Capoeira: The Jogo de Angola from Luanda to Cyberspace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ceW-ABG_IT8C&pg=PA305|date=October 2005|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1-55643-601-7|page=305}}</ref> Brazil's new importance worsened the situation in continental Portugal: politically, it became the Portuguese capital (shedding the pretense of being a colony), and economically, was now able to trade directly with other European powers.\n\n===1820 Revolution===\n[[Image:Domingos Sequeira - D.

The Spanish model also served as an example for the Portuguese: a popular uprising in the provinces against absolutism forced the Spanish monarch to reinstate the 1820 Constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe significance of events in Spain was not lost on a small group of politically like-minded [[bourgeoisie]] in [[Porto]]; two years earlier, Manuel Fernandes Tom\u00e1s, Jos\u00e9 Ferreira Borges, Jos\u00e9 da Silva Carvalho and Jo\u00e3o Ferreira Viana had founded the ''Sin\u00e9drio'', a clandestine [[liberalism|liberal]] group who debated the political evolution of Spain and Portugal and  would influence subsequent events. The Sin\u00e9drio's members were a mixture of merchants, property-owners, the military and noblemen, whose liberalism was based not on personal economic circumstances but on their exposure to international literature and philosophies at university or in the [[masonry|masonic]] lodges.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.279\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.279</ref> The common people were rural, almost totally illiterate and lived in a culture of tradition and religion guided by the clergy.

A colonel read out the declaration:\n:\"Let's join our brothers-in-arms to organize a provisional government that will call on the Cortes to draw-up a Constitution, whose absence is the origin of all our ills.\"<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.277\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.277</ref>\nThe Regency in Lisbon attempted to gather forces to oppose the revolt, but on 15 September they too joined the movement.\n\nThe administration of William Beresford was swiftly replaced by a [[Provisional Junta]], and the \"[[Constituent Cortes of 1820|General Extraordinary and Constituent Cortes of the Portuguese Nation]]\", whose deputies were chosen by indirect election, was summoned on 1 January 1821 to draft a written [[Constitution]].<ref name=\"Armitage1836\">{{cite book|author=John Armitage|title=The history of Brazil, from ... 1808, to ... 1831.

State [[censorship]] of the press and literary productions was lifted, and the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] was extinguished; a general amnesty for those involved in anti-liberal movements was also ordered.<ref name=1820revolution>[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/35.htm The 1820 revolution]</ref> On 26 April 1821,<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.277\"/> John VI departed for Lisbon, arriving on 3 July of the same year, and communicated to the Cortes the establishment of a Regency in Brazil in the name of his heir-apparent, [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. The deputies did not recognize the King's authority to designate regents, nor support the [[Bragan\u00e7a Agreement]], which stipulated that the Portuguese Crown should pass to Prince Pedro if Brazil gained its independence.\n\n===Empire of Brazil===\n[[Image:Flag of Empire of Brazil (1870-1889).svg|thumb|235px|left|Flag of the independent ''[[Empire of Brazil]]'', under Peter I]]\nTalk of separatism had dominated the economic and intellectual circles of Brazil, which was prosperous, although at least one third of its population of 3.5 million were African [[Slavery in Brazil|slaves]]. The question was whether Brazil should return to being a colony of Portugal or the reverse should be the case. While most Portuguese-born Brazilians believed in a united empire, the majority of natives and local politicians aspired to some form of independence for their homeland.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.281-282</ref> The historical evidence indicates that regardless of any developments in Portuguese politics, Brazil would have proclaimed independence after the return of King John VI to Portugal.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.282</ref> The [[separatism|separatist]] movement rose from the conflict between the Regency of Prince Pedro meant to rule frugally and started by cutting his own [[salary]], centralizing scattered government offices and selling off most of the royal [[horse]]s and [[mule]]s. He issued decrees eliminating the royal [[salt]] [[tax]] to spur the output of [[Hide (skin)|hides]] and dried [[beef]]; he forbade arbitrary seizure of private [[property]]; required a judge's [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] for arrests of freemen; and banned secret [[trial (law)|trials]], [[torture]], and other indignities. He also sent elected deputies to the Portuguese Cortes. [[slavery|Slaves]] continued to be bought and sold and disciplined with force, however, despite his assertion that their blood was the same color as his and the Portuguese Cortes.\n\nIn September 1821, the Portuguese Cortes, with a handful of the Brazilian delegates present, voted to abolish the [[Kingdom of Brazil]] and the royal agencies in [[Rio de Janeiro]], thus subordinating all provinces of Brazil directly to [[Lisbon]]. Troops were sent to Brazil to stifle resistance, and local units were placed under Portuguese command.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.283; As Borges Carneiro would remark in the Cortes, the Brazilians needed a guard dog to put them in order.</ref>  On 29 September, the ''Cortes'' ordered Prince Pedro to return to Europe to complete his education with a tour of Spain, France and England, but the governmental junta in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], as well as the Senate Chamber of Rio de Janeiro implored the prince to remain. He was moved by petitions from Brazilian towns and fears that his departure, with the consequent dismantling of the central government, would trigger separatist movements.<ref>The atmosphere was so charged that Prince Pedro sought assurances of asylum on a [[United Kingdom|British]] ship in case he lost the looming confrontation; he also sent his family to safety out of the city.\n</ref>\n\nPedro formed a new government headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrade e Silva]], a former royal official and professor of science at the [[University of Coimbra]] who was a formative figure in Brazilian [[nationalism]], and known as the \"Patriarch of Independence\".<ref name=Andrade_e_Silva>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060128104640/http://psg.com/~walter/bonifaci.html  Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrade e Silva]</ref> Following Prince Pedro's decision to defy the Cortes, Portuguese troops rioted, then concentrated in the area of Mount Castello, which was soon surrounded by thousands of armed Brazilians. Pedro dismissed the Portuguese commanding general, General Jorge Avilez, and ordered him to remove his soldiers across the bay to [[Niter\u00f3i]], where they would await transportation to Portugal.<ref>In the following days, the Portuguese commander delayed embarkation, hoping that expected reinforcements would arrive.  However, the reinforcements that arrived off Rio de Janeiro on 5 March 1822 were not allowed to land. Instead, they were given supplies for the voyage back to Portugal.</ref> Blood was also shed in Recife, Province of [[Pernambuco]], when the Portuguese garrison was forced to depart in November 1821. In mid-February 1822, Brazilians in [[Bahia]] revolted against the Portuguese forces there, but were driven into the countryside, where they began guerrilla operations, signaling that the struggle in the north would not be without loss of life and property.\n\nHoping to rally support throughout the country, Pedro began a series of initiatives to strengthen his position, even as the Portuguese Cortes ridiculed  him and disparaged his importance. In [[Minas Gerais]], where there were no Portuguese garrisons stationed, some doubts lingered, especially among the junta of [[Ouro Preto]]. With only a few companions and no pomp or ceremony, Pedro plunged into Minas Gerais on horseback in late March 1822, receiving enthusiastic welcomes and vows of allegiance everywhere. On 13 May, in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Pedro was proclaimed the \"Perpetual Defender of Brazil\" by the [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] legislative assembly and he took the opportunity to call for a constituent assembly. To broaden his base of support, he joined the [[freemasons]], who, led by [[Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrade e Silva]], were pressing for parliamentary government and independence. More confident now, in early August he called on the Brazilian deputies in Lisbon to return, decreed that Portuguese forces in Brazil should be treated as enemies, and issued a manifesto to \"friendly nations\" that read like a declaration of independence. Seeking to duplicate his triumph in Minas Gerais, Pedro rode to [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] in August to ensure his support there.\n\nReturning from an excursion to [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]], Pedro received messages from his wife Princess [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Maria Leopoldina]] and Andrade e Silva that the Portuguese Cortes had declared his government traitorous, and were dispatching more troops. Pedro then had to choose between returning to Portugal in disgrace, or breaking the last ties to Portugal; in a famous scene in front of the [[Ipiranga Brook|Ipiranga River]] on 7 September 1822, he tore the Portuguese white and blue insignia from his uniform, drew his sword, and swore: \"By my blood, by my honor, and by God: I will make Brazil free.\" With this oath, repeated by the assembled crowd, he announced: \"Brazilians, from this day forward our motto will be...Independence or Death\"<ref>Neil Macaulay (1986), p.125</ref>\n\n==Absolutism==\n[[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] had no pretensions to the throne until his older brother [[Joseph, Prince of Beira]], died from [[smallpox]] at the age of 27. John, then 21 years old, lived for hunting and had little interest in public affairs. However, four years later he became [[Prince Regent]] because of Queen Maria I's mental illness, and in 1816, he became King John VI after her death while the royal family was residing in Rio de Janeiro. In 1821 he was forced to return to a country economically and politically unstable, to preside over a recently installed constitutional monarchy. There were deep divisions between the returning Royal Court and the Portuguese Cortes that governed the nation. While the free-thinking ''[[Vintism|Vintistas]]'' of the upper class governed, the new \"modern era\" was such in name only: the former condition of the poor still prevailed, they remaining pro-monarchist and ultra-religious, but without the power to change their circumstances.<ref>Marcus Checke (1969), p.90</ref>\n\n===Vilafrancada===\n[[Image:Vilafrancada.jpg|thumb|left|235px|''Vilafrancada'': Prince Michael being acclaimed in [[Vila Franca de Xira]]]]\nThe situation in continental Europe changed in 1823. Once again influenced by events in Spain, where the anti-liberal Santa Alian\u00e7a had restored the absolute monarchy, pro-monarchist forces gravitated towards Queen [[Carlota Joaquina de Borb\u00f3n]]. The queen was very conservative, ambitious and violent, and at the same time despised her husband's politics, manners and personality.<ref name=Queen>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126114031/http://worldroots.com/brigitte/royal/bio/carlotaspainbio1775.html  Queen Carlota Joaquina]</ref> While in Brazil, she had attempted to obtain administration of Spanish dominions in [[Latin America]] and was involved in various obscure conspiracies regarding the independence of Brazil.<ref>Thomson 2014, p. 51</ref> The return of the king and the royal court had emboldened the clergy and nobles who were hostile to the Constitution and parliamentary government.\n\nPrince Miguel, who shared the queen's views, served as her instrument to subvert the revolution. On  27 May 1823, the prince organized an insurgency against the liberal constitution; a garrison from Lisbon joined Miguel in [[Vila Franca de Xira]], and there [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] was proclaimed. The king responded by suspending the 1822 Constitution and promising the promulgation of a new law to guarantee \"personal security, property and jobs\". The revolt was referred to as the ''[[Vilafrancada]]'' (events that occurred in Vila Franca).<ref name=\"Paquette2013\">{{cite book|author=Gabriel B.

She gave no quarter, and in 1823, the police revealed a conspiracy led by her and Prince Miguel (who had been promoted to the post of commander-in-chief of the Army following the events of the ''Vilafrancada'') to force the King to abdicate. Then, on 30 April, Miguel, using the pretext that the King's life was in danger, imprisoned numerous ministers and important figures of the kingdom, while keeping his father ''incommunicado'' in the [[Bemposta Palace]].<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.284-285</ref> This second attempt to depose King John became known as the ''Abrilada'', (after \"Abril\", the Portuguese word for \"April\"). During the course of his actions Miguel had offended the sensibilities of the British and French ambassadors, who managed to get John to the British battleship ''Windsor Castle'' in [[Caxias, Oeiras|Caxias]].<ref>Paquette 2013, p. 284</ref> There he was made aware of the situation, summoned Miguel, dismissed him from the post of commander-in-chief of the army, and sent him into exile. On 14 May, John returned to the [[Bemposta Palace|Palace of Bemposta]] and re-established the liberal government. However, a new conspiracy was discovered on October 26 of the same year. The queen accused the liberals of attempting to poison the king, while they suspected her of having done it herself:<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.285\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.285</ref> this time, she was exiled to [[Queluz National Palace|Queluz]].\n\nDuring his reign as king, John promoted the arts (mainly literature), commerce and agriculture, but being forced to return to Europe and to keep track of the court intrigues that arose following the independence of Brazil made him an unhappy man, and he died soon after the ''Abrilada'' in 1826. It was also at the end of his life that he recognized the independence of Brazil (15 November 1825) and restored his son Pedro's [[Order of succession|right of succession]] to the Portuguese throne. Before his death, he named a regency council presided over by the [[Infanta]] [[Isabel Maria of Braganza|Isabel Maria]] to govern the country between his death and the acclamation of the future king.<ref name=\"Robertson2002\">{{cite book|author=Ian Robertson|title=A Traveller's History of Portugal|url=https://archive.org/details/travellershistor00robe_0|url-access=registration|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Interlink Books|isbn=978-1-56656-440-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/travellershistor00robe_0/page/120 120]}}</ref>\n\n==To Civil War==\n{{main|Liberal Wars}}\n[[Image:DpedroI-brasil-full.jpg|thumb|125px|Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]], established the 1826 Portuguese Constitution, considered by some to be too pragmatic for the time]]\n[[Image:Retrato de D. Miguel I - Johann Nepomuk Ender (digitally restored).png|thumb|125px|Prince Michael usurped the throne from his niece and consort, [[Maria II of Portugal|Princess Maria da Gloria]] to reign as absolute monarch]]\nThe death of King John VI sparked a constitutional crisis, as his rightful successor, Prince Pedro, was the Emperor of Brazil. To absolutists, the proclamation of Brazilian independence created a foreign nation, thus revoking Pedro's citizenship and his right of succession to the throne.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.286\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.286</ref> John had left his daughter [[Isabel Maria of Braganza|Princess Isabel Maria]] as regent, expecting that Pedro would return to Portugal and reunite Brazil with its former colonial overlord. Prince Miguel was also an undesirable option; he had been exiled due to several attempts he made to overthrow his own father, and supported the extremist politics of his mother, Queen Carlota, whom most of the liberals and moderates feared.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.286\"/> Pedro accepted the throne of Portugal as King Pedro IV on 10 March 1826, after the regency deemed him the legitimate heir to the throne and sent a delegation to offer him the crown.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.25</ref>\n\nIn Brazil, Pedro faced other challenges to his newborn country; the people clearly did not wish to return to colonial status and subservience to the politics and economy of the much smaller kingdom of Portugal. The Brazilian constitution prohibited the Emperor from subsuming another crown; this fact obliged Pedro to choose between Portugal or Brazil.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.285\"/> Pedro, a pragmatic politician, tried to find a solution that would reconcile the desires of the liberal, moderate and absolutist elements in the debate, and eventually chose to abdicate as king of Portugal (28 May 1826) in favor of his eldest daughter [[Maria II of Portugal|Princess Maria da Gl\u00f3ria]], who was seven years old at the time. The abdication was conditional: Portugal should receive a new Constitution, i.e., the 1826 Charter, and his brother Miguel, exiled in [[Vienna]], was to marry the Princess when she came of age.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.285\"/> The Constitution was not popular with the absolutists (who wanted Prince Miguel to govern as an absolute monarch), but the liberal ''[[Vintism|Vintistas]]'' also did not support the Charter (which was imposed by the King); moderates bided their time as a counter-revolution was slowly building.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.286\"/>\n\n===Usurpation===\nIn 1828, Prince Miguel returned from [[Austria]], becoming Pedro's lieutenant and replacing their sister [[Isabel Maria of Braganza|Princess Isabel Maria]], who was ill, as regent. Over the next few months, absolutist politicians, clergymen and supporters of Queen Carlota manipulated political developments and eventually deposed Maria da Gl\u00f3ria (who had not yet arrived in Portugal) and proclaimed Miguel King of Portugal. They also annulled the liberal Constitution, persecuted liberals and their supporters, and attempted to obtain international support for their regime. Thousands of liberal idealists were killed, arrested, or forced to flee to Spain, England, the [[Azores]] and Brazil.<ref name=absolutist_reaction>[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/spain/port181451.html Liberalism versus Reaction]: Portugal 1814\u20131851</ref> This usurpation was followed by demonstrations in support of absolutism and failed revolutions to reinstate liberalism.\n\nThe sequence of events inevitably triggered the [[Liberal Wars]] between the supporters of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]], led by Miguel, and those of [[liberalism]]. Miguel tried to obtain international support for his cause, but failed due to [[United Kingdom|British]] pressure, although the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Mexico]] did recognize his authority. Between 1828 and 1834, forces loyal to progressive liberalism battled the power of Miguel's absolute monarchy. A liberal uprising in [[Porto]] led by exiles [[Pedro de Sousa Holstein, 1st Duke of Palmela|Pedro de Sousa Holstein]] (later 1st [[Duke of Palmela]]), [[Jo\u00e3o Carlos Saldanha de Oliveira Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha|Jo\u00e3o Carlos Saldanha de Oliveira Daun]] (later 1st [[Duke of Saldanha]]) and [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Severim de Noronha]] (later [[Duke of Terceira]]), was quickly defeated by Miguel's forces<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.287</ref> while similar revolts in the Azores and Madeira were similarly defeated (the liberal forces were able to hold onto territory only in [[Terceira]]).<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.288\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.288</ref><ref name=\"Prince1843\">{{cite book|author=Philip Alexander Prince|title=Parallel History: Being an Outline of the History and Biography of the World, Contemporaneously Arranged|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FnJCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA432|year=1843|publisher=Whittaker|page=432}}</ref>\n\n===Portuguese Civil War===\n[[Image:Retrato do Duque da Terceira.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Severim de Noronha]], leader of the liberal government-in-exile, responsible for the defense of Porto, and later the defeat of Miguelist forces in Lisbon]]\nThe [[political climate]] began to change in 1830. Popular opposition to Pedro's reign in the aftermath of the dismissal of several of his ministers during a growing economic crisis forced him to abdicate his throne in Brazil in favor of his son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], on 7 April 1831.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.288\"/> He then returned to Europe, but found little support from England or France for his quest to regain the throne; instead, he collected arms, money and mercenaries to install his daughter on the throne. He then departed for [[Terceira Island|Terceira]] in the [[Azores]], from where his government-in-exile organized an expeditionary force that [[Landing at Mindelo|disembarked in Mindelo]], not far from [[Porto]], on 8 July 1832.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.288\"/>\n\nWith the backing of liberals from Spain and England, and substantial Anglo-French contingents, Pedro landed near [[Porto]], which the [[Miguelist]] forces abandoned without combat. After fighting the inconclusive [[Battle of Ponte Ferreira]], Miguelite forces [[Siege of Porto|besieged]] Porto, engaging in sporadic skirmishes. Throughout the year, most of the battles of the Civil War concentrated around Porto, whose population had whole-heartedly supported the liberal cause.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.289\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.289</ref> In June 1833, the liberals, still encircled at Porto, sent out a force commanded by the [[Duke of Terceira]] to [[Algarve]], supported by a naval squadron commanded by [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]], using the alias Carlos de Ponza. The [[Duke of Terceira]] landed in [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] and marched north through [[Alentejo]] to conquer Lisbon on 24 July 1833.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.289\"/> Meanwhile, Napier's squadron encountered the absolutist fleet near [[Cape Saint Vincent]] and decisively defeated it at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]].\n\nThe liberals were able to occupy Lisbon, making it possible for them to repel the Miguelite siege in Porto. A stalemate of nine months ensued. Towards the end of 1833, Maria da Gl\u00f3ria was proclaimed [[Queen regnant]], and Pedro was made [[regent]]. His first act was to confiscate the property of all who had supported Miguel. He also suppressed all religious orders and confiscated their property, an act that suspended friendly relations with the [[Papal States]] for nearly eight years, until mid-1841. The liberals occupied Portugal's major cities, Lisbon and Porto, where they commanded a sizable following among the middle classes.\n\nMeanwhile, the absolutists controlled the rural areas, where they were supported by the aristocracy and a peasantry galvanized by the [[Catholic Church|Church]]. Operations against the Miguelists recommenced in early 1834, and they were defeated at the [[Battle of Asseiceira]]. The Miguelite army, however, was still a force (about 18,000 men) to be reckoned with, but on May 24, 1834, at the [[Concession of Evoramonte]], peace was declared under a convention by which Miguel formally consented to renounce all claims to the throne of Portugal, was guaranteed an annual pension, and was banished from Portugal, never to return. Pedro restored the Constitutional Charter and died soon after, on 24 September 1834, while his daughter assumed the throne as [[Maria II of Portugal]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kingdom of Northern Lusitania]], proposed by [[Napoleon]]\n* [[Timeline of Portuguese history]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{inline citations|section|date=February 2020}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|first=James Maxwell|last=Anderson|year=2000|title=The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations: The History of Portugal|isbn=0-313-31106-4|location=Westport, Connecticut|publisher=Greenwood Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UoryGn9o4x0C&pg=PA52&dq=The+History+of+Portugal+livermore#v=onepage&q=The%20History%20of%20Portugal%20livermore&f=false}}\n* {{cite book|last=Birmingham|first=David|year=1993|title=A Concise History of Portugal|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-53686-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8MQlBP0IrHgC&pg=PA210&dq=historia+portugal#v=onepage&q=maria%20da%20fonte&f=false}}\n* {{cite book|last=Levine|first=Robert M.|year=1999|title=The History of Brazil|edition=1st|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780313303906|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofbrazilt00robe}}\n* {{Cite book|first=H.V.|last=Livermore|title=A New History of Portugal|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-21320-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=voE6AAAAIAAJ&pg=PR1&dq=The+History+of+Portugal+livermore#v=onepage&q=The%20History%20of%20Portugal%20livermore&f=false|year=1966}} [https://books.google.ca/books?id=fHI3AAAAIAAJ 1st edition 1947]\n* {{cite book|first=Neil|last=Macaulay|title=Dom Pedro: The Struggle for Liberty in Brazil and Portugal, 1798-1834|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8223-0681-6|year=1986|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__0KrEZGkmUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dom+Pedro#v=onepage&q&f=false}}\n* Payne, Stanley G.

This would be one of the causes for the declaration of [[Independence of Brazil|Brazilian independence]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil]] in 1822, following a liberal revolution in Portugal.\n\nThe liberal period was stormy and short as [[Miguel of Portugal]] (Pedro's brother) supported an [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] revolution endeavoring to restore all power to the monarchy. Pedro eventually returned to Portugal and fought and defeated his brother in the [[Liberal Wars]] in which [[liberalism]] prevailed and Portugal became a constitutional monarchy.\n\n==Queen Maria I==\n[[Image:Rainha D.

Before becoming queen, Princess Maria and her husband, the [[Pedro III of Portugal|Infante Pedro]], lived on the sidelines of politics, but were clearly unsympathetic to her father's former Prime Minister, [[Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo]], the [[Marquis of Pombal]], who had been the ''de facto'' ruler of the kingdom for the past 27 years.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.260</ref><ref name=\"Marcus Cheke 1969, p.3\">Marcus Cheke (1969), p.3</ref> During her father's last few years, she had been the Marquis' fiercest detractor; once in power, she eagerly dismissed him and then exiled him to [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]].<ref>Her dislike for Pombal was so great that she issued one of the world's earliest [[restraining order]]s, commanding that Pombal should never be closer than {{convert|32|km|mi}} to her; in situations where the Queen was close to his estates, he was compelled to remove himself from his house to fulfill the royal decree.

A popular uprising in Spain immediately spread to Junot's forces, which were accompanied by Spanish troops, and further instigated a popular uprising by the Portuguese that was brutally put down after some minor successes.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.270-271</ref>\n\nThe following year, a British force commanded by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] (future [[Duke of Wellington (title)|Duke of Wellington]]) disembarked in [[Galiza]] with the intent of supporting the Spanish, but later advanced on Porto and landed at [[Figueira da Foz Municipality|Figueira da Foz]] on 1 August.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.270\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.270</ref> The British-Portuguese forces advanced quickly on the French, defeating them at the [[Battle of Roli\u00e7a]] (17 August) and later the [[Battle of Vimeiro]] (21 August).<ref name=\"CUP 1970, p.399\">CUP (1970), p.399</ref> A two-day armistice was observed as negotiations proceeded and the belligerents formally signed the [[Convention of Sintra]] (30 August), without Portuguese representation.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.271\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.271</ref> As part of the accord, the British transported the French troops to France, with the product of sacks made in Portugal.

With winter quickly approaching, his forces starving, they were again defeated at the [[Battle of Redinha]] and with Anglo-Portuguese forces in pursuit, Massena crossed the border into Spain; the War would continue until March 1814, but not on Portuguese territory.<ref name=\"James Maxwell Anderson 2000 p.129\"/>\n\nA series of battles in Spain followed, until a final victory was reached on French soil in the [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Battle of Toulouse]] on April 10, 1814, putting an end to the Peninsular War. However, in numerous coastal, interior and border towns there were bodies bayoneted and left on the ground; several frontier towns were pillaged and ransacked for treasure or vandalized by retreating troops (both British and French); reprisal killings were common in the local populations for sympathizers (the total number of casualties in the war reached 100,000 by one account);<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.270\"/> while famine and social deprivation was common.<ref name=\"James Maxwell Anderson 2000 p.129\"/>\n\nFurthermore, the instability in Spain and the abdication of the king, resulted in declarations of independence in the Spanish colonies of [[Americas|America]], which in turn was responsible for a tense political climate in Brazil.\n\nIn 1816, and as a result of the increasing influence of the [[Liga Federal]], the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] invaded and conquered the [[Banda Oriental]], annexing it under the name of [[Cisplatina|Prov\u00edncia Cisplatina]] in 1821.\n\n==Liberal Revolution==\n[[File:Flag of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves.svg|thumb|left|235px|Flag of the ''[[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]'' (1816\u20131826)]]\n[[Image:William Carr Beresford, Viscount Beresford by Sir William Beechey (2).jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[William Carr Beresford]], who administered mainland Portugal during the post-[[Peninsular War]] period]]\nFrom 1808 through 1821, Portugal was effectively both a British [[protectorate]] and a colony of Brazil, as the [[King of Portugal|Portuguese Crown]] remained in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name=\"James Maxwell Anderson 2000 p.129\"/> The moving of the Portuguese capital to [[Rio de Janeiro]] accentuated the economic, institutional and social crises in mainland Portugal, which was administered by English commercial and military interests under William Beresford's rule in the absence of the monarch.

The prohibition on transformative industries was rescinded, and new incentives were offered for: the creation of factories, the importation of British machinery, ship construction, and road building, as well as the foundation and construction of public schools and military academies. In addition to these improvements, the Bank of Brazil was chartered and insurance companies, commerce commissions and currency exchanges were established.

The Spanish model also served as an example for the Portuguese: a popular uprising in the provinces against absolutism forced the Spanish monarch to reinstate the 1820 Constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe significance of events in Spain was not lost on a small group of politically like-minded [[bourgeoisie]] in [[Porto]]; two years earlier, Manuel Fernandes Tom\u00e1s, Jos\u00e9 Ferreira Borges, Jos\u00e9 da Silva Carvalho and Jo\u00e3o Ferreira Viana had founded the ''Sin\u00e9drio'', a clandestine [[liberalism|liberal]] group who debated the political evolution of Spain and Portugal and  would influence subsequent events.

State [[censorship]] of the press and literary productions was lifted, and the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] was extinguished; a general amnesty for those involved in anti-liberal movements was also ordered.<ref name=1820revolution>[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/35.htm The 1820 revolution]</ref> On 26 April 1821,<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.277\"/> John VI departed for Lisbon, arriving on 3 July of the same year, and communicated to the Cortes the establishment of a Regency in Brazil in the name of his heir-apparent, [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. The deputies did not recognize the King's authority to designate regents, nor support the [[Bragan\u00e7a Agreement]], which stipulated that the Portuguese Crown should pass to Prince Pedro if Brazil gained its independence.\n\n===Empire of Brazil===\n[[Image:Flag of Empire of Brazil (1870-1889).svg|thumb|235px|left|Flag of the independent ''[[Empire of Brazil]]'', under Peter I]]\nTalk of separatism had dominated the economic and intellectual circles of Brazil, which was prosperous, although at least one third of its population of 3.5 million were African [[Slavery in Brazil|slaves]]. The question was whether Brazil should return to being a colony of Portugal or the reverse should be the case. While most Portuguese-born Brazilians believed in a united empire, the majority of natives and local politicians aspired to some form of independence for their homeland.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.281-282</ref> The historical evidence indicates that regardless of any developments in Portuguese politics, Brazil would have proclaimed independence after the return of King John VI to Portugal.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.282</ref> The [[separatism|separatist]] movement rose from the conflict between the Regency of Prince Pedro meant to rule frugally and started by cutting his own [[salary]], centralizing scattered government offices and selling off most of the royal [[horse]]s and [[mule]]s. He issued decrees eliminating the royal [[salt]] [[tax]] to spur the output of [[Hide (skin)|hides]] and dried [[beef]]; he forbade arbitrary seizure of private [[property]]; required a judge's [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] for arrests of freemen; and banned secret [[trial (law)|trials]], [[torture]], and other indignities. He also sent elected deputies to the Portuguese Cortes. [[slavery|Slaves]] continued to be bought and sold and disciplined with force, however, despite his assertion that their blood was the same color as his and the Portuguese Cortes.\n\nIn September 1821, the Portuguese Cortes, with a handful of the Brazilian delegates present, voted to abolish the [[Kingdom of Brazil]] and the royal agencies in [[Rio de Janeiro]], thus subordinating all provinces of Brazil directly to [[Lisbon]]. Troops were sent to Brazil to stifle resistance, and local units were placed under Portuguese command.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.283; As Borges Carneiro would remark in the Cortes, the Brazilians needed a guard dog to put them in order.</ref>  On 29 September, the ''Cortes'' ordered Prince Pedro to return to Europe to complete his education with a tour of Spain, France and England, but the governmental junta in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], as well as the Senate Chamber of Rio de Janeiro implored the prince to remain. He was moved by petitions from Brazilian towns and fears that his departure, with the consequent dismantling of the central government, would trigger separatist movements.<ref>The atmosphere was so charged that Prince Pedro sought assurances of asylum on a [[United Kingdom|British]] ship in case he lost the looming confrontation; he also sent his family to safety out of the city.\n</ref>\n\nPedro formed a new government headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrade e Silva]], a former royal official and professor of science at the [[University of Coimbra]] who was a formative figure in Brazilian [[nationalism]], and known as the \"Patriarch of Independence\".<ref name=Andrade_e_Silva>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060128104640/http://psg.com/~walter/bonifaci.html  Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrade e Silva]</ref> Following Prince Pedro's decision to defy the Cortes, Portuguese troops rioted, then concentrated in the area of Mount Castello, which was soon surrounded by thousands of armed Brazilians. Pedro dismissed the Portuguese commanding general, General Jorge Avilez, and ordered him to remove his soldiers across the bay to [[Niter\u00f3i]], where they would await transportation to Portugal.<ref>In the following days, the Portuguese commander delayed embarkation, hoping that expected reinforcements would arrive.  However, the reinforcements that arrived off Rio de Janeiro on 5 March 1822 were not allowed to land. Instead, they were given supplies for the voyage back to Portugal.</ref> Blood was also shed in Recife, Province of [[Pernambuco]], when the Portuguese garrison was forced to depart in November 1821. In mid-February 1822, Brazilians in [[Bahia]] revolted against the Portuguese forces there, but were driven into the countryside, where they began guerrilla operations, signaling that the struggle in the north would not be without loss of life and property.\n\nHoping to rally support throughout the country, Pedro began a series of initiatives to strengthen his position, even as the Portuguese Cortes ridiculed  him and disparaged his importance. In [[Minas Gerais]], where there were no Portuguese garrisons stationed, some doubts lingered, especially among the junta of [[Ouro Preto]]. With only a few companions and no pomp or ceremony, Pedro plunged into Minas Gerais on horseback in late March 1822, receiving enthusiastic welcomes and vows of allegiance everywhere. On 13 May, in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Pedro was proclaimed the \"Perpetual Defender of Brazil\" by the [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] legislative assembly and he took the opportunity to call for a constituent assembly. To broaden his base of support, he joined the [[freemasons]], who, led by [[Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrade e Silva]], were pressing for parliamentary government and independence. More confident now, in early August he called on the Brazilian deputies in Lisbon to return, decreed that Portuguese forces in Brazil should be treated as enemies, and issued a manifesto to \"friendly nations\" that read like a declaration of independence. Seeking to duplicate his triumph in Minas Gerais, Pedro rode to [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] in August to ensure his support there.\n\nReturning from an excursion to [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]], Pedro received messages from his wife Princess [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Maria Leopoldina]] and Andrade e Silva that the Portuguese Cortes had declared his government traitorous, and were dispatching more troops. Pedro then had to choose between returning to Portugal in disgrace, or breaking the last ties to Portugal; in a famous scene in front of the [[Ipiranga Brook|Ipiranga River]] on 7 September 1822, he tore the Portuguese white and blue insignia from his uniform, drew his sword, and swore: \"By my blood, by my honor, and by God: I will make Brazil free.\" With this oath, repeated by the assembled crowd, he announced: \"Brazilians, from this day forward our motto will be...Independence or Death\"<ref>Neil Macaulay (1986), p.125</ref>\n\n==Absolutism==\n[[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] had no pretensions to the throne until his older brother [[Joseph, Prince of Beira]], died from [[smallpox]] at the age of 27. John, then 21 years old, lived for hunting and had little interest in public affairs. However, four years later he became [[Prince Regent]] because of Queen Maria I's mental illness, and in 1816, he became King John VI after her death while the royal family was residing in Rio de Janeiro. In 1821 he was forced to return to a country economically and politically unstable, to preside over a recently installed constitutional monarchy. There were deep divisions between the returning Royal Court and the Portuguese Cortes that governed the nation. While the free-thinking ''[[Vintism|Vintistas]]'' of the upper class governed, the new \"modern era\" was such in name only: the former condition of the poor still prevailed, they remaining pro-monarchist and ultra-religious, but without the power to change their circumstances.<ref>Marcus Checke (1969), p.90</ref>\n\n===Vilafrancada===\n[[Image:Vilafrancada.jpg|thumb|left|235px|''Vilafrancada'': Prince Michael being acclaimed in [[Vila Franca de Xira]]]]\nThe situation in continental Europe changed in 1823. Once again influenced by events in Spain, where the anti-liberal Santa Alian\u00e7a had restored the absolute monarchy, pro-monarchist forces gravitated towards Queen [[Carlota Joaquina de Borb\u00f3n]]. The queen was very conservative, ambitious and violent, and at the same time despised her husband's politics, manners and personality.<ref name=Queen>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126114031/http://worldroots.com/brigitte/royal/bio/carlotaspainbio1775.html  Queen Carlota Joaquina]</ref> While in Brazil, she had attempted to obtain administration of Spanish dominions in [[Latin America]] and was involved in various obscure conspiracies regarding the independence of Brazil.<ref>Thomson 2014, p. 51</ref> The return of the king and the royal court had emboldened the clergy and nobles who were hostile to the Constitution and parliamentary government.\n\nPrince Miguel, who shared the queen's views, served as her instrument to subvert the revolution. On  27 May 1823, the prince organized an insurgency against the liberal constitution; a garrison from Lisbon joined Miguel in [[Vila Franca de Xira]], and there [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] was proclaimed. The king responded by suspending the 1822 Constitution and promising the promulgation of a new law to guarantee \"personal security, property and jobs\". The revolt was referred to as the ''[[Vilafrancada]]'' (events that occurred in Vila Franca).<ref name=\"Paquette2013\">{{cite book|author=Gabriel B.

Ultimately the king accepted absolutism when a movement of army officers and citizens surrounded the [[Bemposta Palace|Palace of Bemposta]] to urge him to renounce liberal ideals.\n\n===Abrilada===\n[[Image:Pal\u00e1cio da Bemposta 2.JPG|thumb|235px|left|[[Bemposta Palace]] (residence of [[John VI of Portugal|King John VI]]): where the monarch was held ''incommunicado'' during the ''Abrilada'']]\nIn Portugal, as in Spain, the adversaries of constitutionalism were divided into two factions: a radical and a more moderate group.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.284\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.284</ref> King John depended on the moderate faction; the ministers he selected after the ''Vilafrancada'' oscillated between conciliatory paternal absolutism and a timidly moderate liberalism.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.284\"/> Queen Carlota was the principal supporter of the radical absolutists, who favored absolutism without concessions and the repression of new ideas filtering in from Europe. She gave no quarter, and in 1823, the police revealed a conspiracy led by her and Prince Miguel (who had been promoted to the post of commander-in-chief of the Army following the events of the ''Vilafrancada'') to force the King to abdicate. Then, on 30 April, Miguel, using the pretext that the King's life was in danger, imprisoned numerous ministers and important figures of the kingdom, while keeping his father ''incommunicado'' in the [[Bemposta Palace]].<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.284-285</ref> This second attempt to depose King John became known as the ''Abrilada'', (after \"Abril\", the Portuguese word for \"April\"). During the course of his actions Miguel had offended the sensibilities of the British and French ambassadors, who managed to get John to the British battleship ''Windsor Castle'' in [[Caxias, Oeiras|Caxias]].<ref>Paquette 2013, p. 284</ref> There he was made aware of the situation, summoned Miguel, dismissed him from the post of commander-in-chief of the army, and sent him into exile. On 14 May, John returned to the [[Bemposta Palace|Palace of Bemposta]] and re-established the liberal government. However, a new conspiracy was discovered on October 26 of the same year. The queen accused the liberals of attempting to poison the king, while they suspected her of having done it herself:<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.285\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.285</ref> this time, she was exiled to [[Queluz National Palace|Queluz]].\n\nDuring his reign as king, John promoted the arts (mainly literature), commerce and agriculture, but being forced to return to Europe and to keep track of the court intrigues that arose following the independence of Brazil made him an unhappy man, and he died soon after the ''Abrilada'' in 1826. It was also at the end of his life that he recognized the independence of Brazil (15 November 1825) and restored his son Pedro's [[Order of succession|right of succession]] to the Portuguese throne. Before his death, he named a regency council presided over by the [[Infanta]] [[Isabel Maria of Braganza|Isabel Maria]] to govern the country between his death and the acclamation of the future king.<ref name=\"Robertson2002\">{{cite book|author=Ian Robertson|title=A Traveller's History of Portugal|url=https://archive.org/details/travellershistor00robe_0|url-access=registration|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Interlink Books|isbn=978-1-56656-440-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/travellershistor00robe_0/page/120 120]}}</ref>\n\n==To Civil War==\n{{main|Liberal Wars}}\n[[Image:DpedroI-brasil-full.jpg|thumb|125px|Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]], established the 1826 Portuguese Constitution, considered by some to be too pragmatic for the time]]\n[[Image:Retrato de D. Miguel I - Johann Nepomuk Ender (digitally restored).png|thumb|125px|Prince Michael usurped the throne from his niece and consort, [[Maria II of Portugal|Princess Maria da Gloria]] to reign as absolute monarch]]\nThe death of King John VI sparked a constitutional crisis, as his rightful successor, Prince Pedro, was the Emperor of Brazil. To absolutists, the proclamation of Brazilian independence created a foreign nation, thus revoking Pedro's citizenship and his right of succession to the throne.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.286\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.286</ref> John had left his daughter [[Isabel Maria of Braganza|Princess Isabel Maria]] as regent, expecting that Pedro would return to Portugal and reunite Brazil with its former colonial overlord. Prince Miguel was also an undesirable option; he had been exiled due to several attempts he made to overthrow his own father, and supported the extremist politics of his mother, Queen Carlota, whom most of the liberals and moderates feared.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.286\"/> Pedro accepted the throne of Portugal as King Pedro IV on 10 March 1826, after the regency deemed him the legitimate heir to the throne and sent a delegation to offer him the crown.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.25</ref>\n\nIn Brazil, Pedro faced other challenges to his newborn country; the people clearly did not wish to return to colonial status and subservience to the politics and economy of the much smaller kingdom of Portugal. The Brazilian constitution prohibited the Emperor from subsuming another crown; this fact obliged Pedro to choose between Portugal or Brazil.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.285\"/> Pedro, a pragmatic politician, tried to find a solution that would reconcile the desires of the liberal, moderate and absolutist elements in the debate, and eventually chose to abdicate as king of Portugal (28 May 1826) in favor of his eldest daughter [[Maria II of Portugal|Princess Maria da Gl\u00f3ria]], who was seven years old at the time. The abdication was conditional: Portugal should receive a new Constitution, i.e., the 1826 Charter, and his brother Miguel, exiled in [[Vienna]], was to marry the Princess when she came of age.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.285\"/> The Constitution was not popular with the absolutists (who wanted Prince Miguel to govern as an absolute monarch), but the liberal ''[[Vintism|Vintistas]]'' also did not support the Charter (which was imposed by the King); moderates bided their time as a counter-revolution was slowly building.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.286\"/>\n\n===Usurpation===\nIn 1828, Prince Miguel returned from [[Austria]], becoming Pedro's lieutenant and replacing their sister [[Isabel Maria of Braganza|Princess Isabel Maria]], who was ill, as regent. Over the next few months, absolutist politicians, clergymen and supporters of Queen Carlota manipulated political developments and eventually deposed Maria da Gl\u00f3ria (who had not yet arrived in Portugal) and proclaimed Miguel King of Portugal. They also annulled the liberal Constitution, persecuted liberals and their supporters, and attempted to obtain international support for their regime. Thousands of liberal idealists were killed, arrested, or forced to flee to Spain, England, the [[Azores]] and Brazil.<ref name=absolutist_reaction>[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/spain/port181451.html Liberalism versus Reaction]: Portugal 1814\u20131851</ref> This usurpation was followed by demonstrations in support of absolutism and failed revolutions to reinstate liberalism.\n\nThe sequence of events inevitably triggered the [[Liberal Wars]] between the supporters of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]], led by Miguel, and those of [[liberalism]]. Miguel tried to obtain international support for his cause, but failed due to [[United Kingdom|British]] pressure, although the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Mexico]] did recognize his authority. Between 1828 and 1834, forces loyal to progressive liberalism battled the power of Miguel's absolute monarchy. A liberal uprising in [[Porto]] led by exiles [[Pedro de Sousa Holstein, 1st Duke of Palmela|Pedro de Sousa Holstein]] (later 1st [[Duke of Palmela]]), [[Jo\u00e3o Carlos Saldanha de Oliveira Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha|Jo\u00e3o Carlos Saldanha de Oliveira Daun]] (later 1st [[Duke of Saldanha]]) and [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Severim de Noronha]] (later [[Duke of Terceira]]), was quickly defeated by Miguel's forces<ref>Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.287</ref> while similar revolts in the Azores and Madeira were similarly defeated (the liberal forces were able to hold onto territory only in [[Terceira]]).<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.288\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.288</ref><ref name=\"Prince1843\">{{cite book|author=Philip Alexander Prince|title=Parallel History: Being an Outline of the History and Biography of the World, Contemporaneously Arranged|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FnJCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA432|year=1843|publisher=Whittaker|page=432}}</ref>\n\n===Portuguese Civil War===\n[[Image:Retrato do Duque da Terceira.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Severim de Noronha]], leader of the liberal government-in-exile, responsible for the defense of Porto, and later the defeat of Miguelist forces in Lisbon]]\nThe [[political climate]] began to change in 1830. Popular opposition to Pedro's reign in the aftermath of the dismissal of several of his ministers during a growing economic crisis forced him to abdicate his throne in Brazil in favor of his son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], on 7 April 1831.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.288\"/> He then returned to Europe, but found little support from England or France for his quest to regain the throne; instead, he collected arms, money and mercenaries to install his daughter on the throne. He then departed for [[Terceira Island|Terceira]] in the [[Azores]], from where his government-in-exile organized an expeditionary force that [[Landing at Mindelo|disembarked in Mindelo]], not far from [[Porto]], on 8 July 1832.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.288\"/>\n\nWith the backing of liberals from Spain and England, and substantial Anglo-French contingents, Pedro landed near [[Porto]], which the [[Miguelist]] forces abandoned without combat. After fighting the inconclusive [[Battle of Ponte Ferreira]], Miguelite forces [[Siege of Porto|besieged]] Porto, engaging in sporadic skirmishes. Throughout the year, most of the battles of the Civil War concentrated around Porto, whose population had whole-heartedly supported the liberal cause.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.289\">Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva, (2007), p.289</ref> In June 1833, the liberals, still encircled at Porto, sent out a force commanded by the [[Duke of Terceira]] to [[Algarve]], supported by a naval squadron commanded by [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]], using the alias Carlos de Ponza. The [[Duke of Terceira]] landed in [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] and marched north through [[Alentejo]] to conquer Lisbon on 24 July 1833.<ref name=\"Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva 2007 p.289\"/> Meanwhile, Napier's squadron encountered the absolutist fleet near [[Cape Saint Vincent]] and decisively defeated it at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]].\n\nThe liberals were able to occupy Lisbon, making it possible for them to repel the Miguelite siege in Porto. A stalemate of nine months ensued. Towards the end of 1833, Maria da Gl\u00f3ria was proclaimed [[Queen regnant]], and Pedro was made [[regent]]. His first act was to confiscate the property of all who had supported Miguel. He also suppressed all religious orders and confiscated their property, an act that suspended friendly relations with the [[Papal States]] for nearly eight years, until mid-1841. The liberals occupied Portugal's major cities, Lisbon and Porto, where they commanded a sizable following among the middle classes.\n\nMeanwhile, the absolutists controlled the rural areas, where they were supported by the aristocracy and a peasantry galvanized by the [[Catholic Church|Church]]. Operations against the Miguelists recommenced in early 1834, and they were defeated at the [[Battle of Asseiceira]]. The Miguelite army, however, was still a force (about 18,000 men) to be reckoned with, but on May 24, 1834, at the [[Concession of Evoramonte]], peace was declared under a convention by which Miguel formally consented to renounce all claims to the throne of Portugal, was guaranteed an annual pension, and was banished from Portugal, never to return. Pedro restored the Constitutional Charter and died soon after, on 24 September 1834, while his daughter assumed the throne as [[Maria II of Portugal]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kingdom of Northern Lusitania]], proposed by [[Napoleon]]\n* [[Timeline of Portuguese history]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{inline citations|section|date=February 2020}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|first=James Maxwell|last=Anderson|year=2000|title=The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations: The History of Portugal|isbn=0-313-31106-4|location=Westport, Connecticut|publisher=Greenwood Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UoryGn9o4x0C&pg=PA52&dq=The+History+of+Portugal+livermore#v=onepage&q=The%20History%20of%20Portugal%20livermore&f=false}}\n* {{cite book|last=Birmingham|first=David|year=1993|title=A Concise History of Portugal|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-53686-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8MQlBP0IrHgC&pg=PA210&dq=historia+portugal#v=onepage&q=maria%20da%20fonte&f=false}}\n* {{cite book|last=Levine|first=Robert M.|year=1999|title=The History of Brazil|edition=1st|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780313303906|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofbrazilt00robe}}\n* {{Cite book|first=H.V.|last=Livermore|title=A New History of Portugal|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-21320-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=voE6AAAAIAAJ&pg=PR1&dq=The+History+of+Portugal+livermore#v=onepage&q=The%20History%20of%20Portugal%20livermore&f=false|year=1966}} [https://books.google.ca/books?id=fHI3AAAAIAAJ 1st edition 1947]\n* {{cite book|first=Neil|last=Macaulay|title=Dom Pedro: The Struggle for Liberty in Brazil and Portugal, 1798-1834|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8223-0681-6|year=1986|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__0KrEZGkmUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dom+Pedro#v=onepage&q&f=false}}\n* Payne, Stanley G.

Junco (drums). The original group lasted only through that fall when T.J. Junco left the band. Richard Slevin (drums) joined the group in January 1980 and helped the band develop through the year, and though the group was considered part of Pittsburgh's early [[punk rock|punk]]/[[new wave music|new wave]] scene, along with its sister group The Shakes/Combo Tactic. With a somewhat more polished style than many of their peers, The Rave-Ups were considered less an example of the Punk genre and more of a musical stew of punk, pop, country, blues and folk. The band performed mostly [[original work|original songs]] written by Podrasky and Kaniecki, with some songs contributed by Carter, and a few [[cover version|covers]]. Early performances in Pittsburgh were at [[The Electric Banana]], The Decade Lounge, functions at Carnegie Mellon, as well as regular gigs at Fat City in Swissvale.\n\nDuring the summer of 1980 the band made [[Multitrack recording|4-track]] and 16-track studio recordings, including the later popular \"Class Tramp\" and \"In My Gremlin,\" along with the usual live recordings of club dates. Slevin left the band in the summer of 1980 to return to his native New York City and was replaced by Victor McPoland, a fellow Pittsburgher and Carnegie/Mellon grad. Meanwhile, the band left Pittsburgh and relocated briefly to Los Angeles, California. Appearing as the \"band\" in a John Wells (later of E.R. and The West Wing fame) production of Sam Shephard's \"The Tooth of Crime,\" the group spent eight weeks in the sun of Los Angeles before returning home to Pittsburgh. A later return to LA by the band didn't gel and the original members broke up soon afterward. Podrasky returned briefly to Pittsburgh, but eventually booked a flight back to Los Angeles in order to further the musical agenda already established by the Pittsburgh group.\n\n===Second incarnation (''Class Tramp'', ''Town + Country'' and ''Pretty In Pink'')===\nThe second incarnation of the band followed after Podrasky met drummer Tim Jimenez in the San Fernando Valley in 1982. Podrasky and Jimenez quickly became close friends and enlisted a bass player, Colleen Campbell, to join the band. Danny Zippi, already established as an actor, joined the group soon after and the band gigged around Los Angeles, almost always for free. Within the year, Campbell and Zippi were replaced by guitarist Chuck Wada & bassist Douglas Leonard. That line-up signed an indie deal and released a six-song [[extended play|EP]] entitled ''Class Tramp'' on Fun Stuff Records in 1983. The EP sold all 3,000 copies produced. But the Podrasky-Jimenez-Wada-Leonard line-up didn't last long. Late in 1984, Terry Wilson (guitar) and Tommy Blatnik (bass guitar) joined the band on a permanent basis. Ironically, all four members of the band now worked in the mailroom/shipping department of A&M Records, and it was in the basement of the A&M lot that the band rehearsed nightly, honing their craft amongst stacks of posters, album flats and music merchandising. In 1985, the band released their first full-length album, ''Town + Country'', which was met with widespread critical acclaim and sold more than 40,000 copies. The album's only single, \"Positively Lost Me,\" became a college radio hit and cemented the band as thoughtful alt-rockers with an extremely accessible sound, smart songs, and a considerable fondness for country, blues and folk.\n\nActress [[Molly Ringwald]], who had become a friend and fan of the band through her sister Beth's relationship with Podrasky, introduced the band to moviegoers in the John Hughes' classic [[Sixteen Candles]] when her character's three-ring binder featured the name \"The Rave-Ups\" scratched on it with a ball point pen. Ringwald later invited director [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] to see the band at a club date where the band informally and successfully auditioned for an appearance in the movie ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''. In the movie, the Rave-Ups play their song \"Rave-Up, Shut-Up\" on stage while Duckie ([[Jon Cryer]]) talks with Iona ([[Annie Potts]]) at a nearby table, just before Andie (Ringwald) and Blane ([[Andrew McCarthy]]) join them. The next song played by the Rave-Ups in this scene is \"Positively Lost Me.\"  The band also appeared on the [[MTV]] \"Pretty In Pink\" Movie Premier Special performing \"Positively Lost Me\". That song became a [[cult hit]] big enough that [[Rhino Records]] included the song on Rhino's ''[[Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of the '80s#Volume 12|Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of The 80's - Vol. 12]]''. During this time the band was getting major acclaim from critics including [[Robert Christgau]], [[Robert Hilburn]], J.D. Considine, Todd Everett and Roy Trakin and entered into talks with several major record labels.\n\nDuring their still-evolving musical peak, the band was locked in legal battles, all in the hope of moving on to a major label; from 1986 to 1987, little music was released, with the exception of a 12-inch single, \"These Wishes\" (later covered by Pittsburgh band, The Clarks).  The poignant ballad \"Big Wide River\" was the B-side of the single, which was produced by Los Lobos' Steve Berlin and engineer Mark Linnett. The band recorded a full-length album with Berlin and Linnett producing, but the record was never released.\n\n===Epic records (''The Book of Your Regrets'' and ''Chance'')===\nIn 1987, the band signed to [[Epic Records]] and released their major label debut ''The Book of Your Regrets''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/music/album/rave+ups/book+of+your+regrets|title=Book Of Your Regrets|date=December 31, 1987|publisher=|accessdate=August 26, 2018}}</ref> to high critical expectations, despite being only promoted to the [[college radio]] scene (albeit a burgeoning one). The album failed to sell many copies, due to Epic's corporate restructuring with Sony and lack of promotion. The label almost dropped the band but a few believers from Epic insisted that the band get another opportunity. That same year, their song \"Class Tramp\" appeared in the cult horror anthology film ''[[From a Whisper to a Scream (film)|From a Whisper to a Scream]]''.\n\n1990 saw the release of the album ''Chance''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/music/album/rave+ups/chance|title=Chance|date=January 1, 1990|publisher=|accessdate=August 26, 2018}}</ref> (named after Podrasky's son with Beth Ringwald) to slightly more commercial success. The single \"Respectfully King of Rain\" became a modest alternative rock hit, garnering some video airplay on MTV and peaking at No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. The second single, a radio-friendly pop anthem called \"(She Says) Come Around\" was readied for distribution (including a music video) by Epic who then decided that they would not promote the single or video and, soon after, dropped the band from the label. The band continued working for a few months, including an appearance on an episode of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' (\"Spring Dance\") and an opening slot on the [[Indigo Girls]] tour. Podrasky soon found himself in a brief relationship/engagement with 90210s star, Shannon Doherty; however, Podrasky's single-father status (he and Ringwald had split-up many months earlier) didn't gel with a Hollywood lifestyle and the relationship soon ended. Within months, after much frustration, The Rave-Ups unofficially  broke up in 1992.\n\n===Post break up===\nIn 1996-1997, Podrasky briefly formed the band The Lovin' Miserys with [[Concrete Blonde]] drummer [[Harry Rushakoff]], producing the limited pressing CD Happy as Hell, which was released only to radio stations.[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-02-20-ca-30763-story.html] During live shows, they were joined by bass player Sam Bolle from Agent Orange, though in the LA Times interview Jimmer said \u201cOn the album, it's just me and Harry Rushakoff.\u201dIn 2000, members of The Rave-Ups (Podrasky and Wilson) reformed, recording a CD entitled ''The Salmon in the Woods'' which has remained unreleased as of 2012.\n\nOver the years, Wilson has played on stage and in studio with many bands including the Springfield, Missouri all-star band, The Dog People and spending some time with The Ozark Mountain Devils. Jimenez continues to play with and produce various bands in Los Angeles. Blatnik has also spent time playing with The Dancing Hoods (whose guitarist Mark Linkous later formed [[Sparklehorse]]) and The Lonesome Strangers (featuring singer/songwriters Randy Weeks & Jeff Rymes).\n\n===Reformation and future developments===\nPodrasky and Wilson continued to maintain a musical partnership, writing and performing occasionally over the following years. In August 2007, with Jimenez and Blatnik back in the rhythm section, the band re-grouped to play some shows in the Los Angeles area. Since then, they've occasionally performed in southern California, but have yet to release any brand new material. Rumors of a new Rave-Ups record continue to tease diehard fans of the band.\n\nJimmer Podrasky recorded his first solo album with drummer/producer Mitch Marine, guitarist/songwriter Brian Whelan and bassist/songwriter Ted Russell Kamp; the album is ''\"The Would-Be Plans\"'' and was released through JimmerMusic.com in September 2013. According to an interview with MSN Music, Podrasky had intended the album to be a Rave-Ups reunion but couldn't get the other band members on board. Though he had the right to release it as a Rave-Ups record, he felt it wouldn't be right, so it's his first official solo album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/post--rave-ups-leader-back-with-blistering-new-music|accessdate=August 26, 2018|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925220659/http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/post--rave-ups-leader-back-with-blistering-new-music|archive-date=September 25, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nPodrasky has since recorded his second solo album and is working on its completion and release.\n\nIn late 2015, The Rave-Ups approached Omnivore Recordings about re-releasing the ''\"Town + Country\"'' album as part of the 30th anniversary of the initial Fun Stuff Records release. On July 8, 2016, the re-release became a reality. This reissue of ''\"Town + Country\"'' features the original 10 songs, plus a whopping 11 previously unissued bonus tracks \u2014 including live radio performances recorded for Dierdre O'Donoghue's influential \"SNAP\" program on Los Angeles\u2019 legendary KCRW-FM, as well as 1986 material produced by Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) and Mark Linett. A detailed historical essay from the band's Jimmer Podrasky, complemented by numerous unseen photos from the sessions/era, make this not only a document of time + place, but one that helps document a moment in musical history. Mastering and restoration was overseen by Grammy\u00ae winner Gavin Lurssen.\n\nAccording to Podrasky from the liners: \u201cMusic has the uncanny ability to thwart time and space. It informs a moment. It indexes lives. It creates strange bedfellows. It outlasts people \u2014 even the people who helped make the music. Music resonates more than any other art form \u2014 that is its unique power. It remains with us long after the last note has faded. ''\"Town + Country\"'' was the beginning of a lifelong journey for me \u2014 the start of a trip that still hasn\u2019t ended. I\u2019m proud and honored to have been a part of something that has withstood the test of time.\u201d\n\n''Town + Country'' is available at [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]], [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].\n\nJimmer Podrasky is a first cousin of the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, [[John Roberts]].\n\n==Band members==\n;Main line-up (1984-92)\n*Jimmer Podrasky \u2013 guitar, vocals\n*Tim Jimenez \u2013 drums\n*Terry Wilson \u2013 guitar\n*Tommy Blatnik \u2013 bass\n\n;All members\n*Jimmer Podrasky \u2013 guitar, vocals (1979-80, 1982-92)\n*Michael Kaniecki \u2013 guitar, vocals (1979-80)\n*George Carter \u2013 bass, violin, vocals (1979-80)\n*T.J.

Appearing as the \"band\" in a John Wells (later of E.R. and The West Wing fame) production of Sam Shephard's \"The Tooth of Crime,\" the group spent eight weeks in the sun of Los Angeles before returning home to Pittsburgh. A later return to LA by the band didn't gel and the original members broke up soon afterward. Podrasky returned briefly to Pittsburgh, but eventually booked a flight back to Los Angeles in order to further the musical agenda already established by the Pittsburgh group.\n\n===Second incarnation (''Class Tramp'', ''Town + Country'' and ''Pretty In Pink'')===\nThe second incarnation of the band followed after Podrasky met drummer Tim Jimenez in the San Fernando Valley in 1982. Podrasky and Jimenez quickly became close friends and enlisted a bass player, Colleen Campbell, to join the band. Danny Zippi, already established as an actor, joined the group soon after and the band gigged around Los Angeles, almost always for free. Within the year, Campbell and Zippi were replaced by guitarist Chuck Wada & bassist Douglas Leonard. That line-up signed an indie deal and released a six-song [[extended play|EP]] entitled ''Class Tramp'' on Fun Stuff Records in 1983. The EP sold all 3,000 copies produced. But the Podrasky-Jimenez-Wada-Leonard line-up didn't last long. Late in 1984, Terry Wilson (guitar) and Tommy Blatnik (bass guitar) joined the band on a permanent basis. Ironically, all four members of the band now worked in the mailroom/shipping department of A&M Records, and it was in the basement of the A&M lot that the band rehearsed nightly, honing their craft amongst stacks of posters, album flats and music merchandising. In 1985, the band released their first full-length album, ''Town + Country'', which was met with widespread critical acclaim and sold more than 40,000 copies. The album's only single, \"Positively Lost Me,\" became a college radio hit and cemented the band as thoughtful alt-rockers with an extremely accessible sound, smart songs, and a considerable fondness for country, blues and folk.\n\nActress [[Molly Ringwald]], who had become a friend and fan of the band through her sister Beth's relationship with Podrasky, introduced the band to moviegoers in the John Hughes' classic [[Sixteen Candles]] when her character's three-ring binder featured the name \"The Rave-Ups\" scratched on it with a ball point pen. Ringwald later invited director [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] to see the band at a club date where the band informally and successfully auditioned for an appearance in the movie ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''. In the movie, the Rave-Ups play their song \"Rave-Up, Shut-Up\" on stage while Duckie ([[Jon Cryer]]) talks with Iona ([[Annie Potts]]) at a nearby table, just before Andie (Ringwald) and Blane ([[Andrew McCarthy]]) join them. The next song played by the Rave-Ups in this scene is \"Positively Lost Me.\"  The band also appeared on the [[MTV]] \"Pretty In Pink\" Movie Premier Special performing \"Positively Lost Me\". That song became a [[cult hit]] big enough that [[Rhino Records]] included the song on Rhino's ''[[Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of the '80s#Volume 12|Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of The 80's - Vol. 12]]''. During this time the band was getting major acclaim from critics including [[Robert Christgau]], [[Robert Hilburn]], J.D. Considine, Todd Everett and Roy Trakin and entered into talks with several major record labels.\n\nDuring their still-evolving musical peak, the band was locked in legal battles, all in the hope of moving on to a major label; from 1986 to 1987, little music was released, with the exception of a 12-inch single, \"These Wishes\" (later covered by Pittsburgh band, The Clarks).  The poignant ballad \"Big Wide River\" was the B-side of the single, which was produced by Los Lobos' Steve Berlin and engineer Mark Linnett. The band recorded a full-length album with Berlin and Linnett producing, but the record was never released.\n\n===Epic records (''The Book of Your Regrets'' and ''Chance'')===\nIn 1987, the band signed to [[Epic Records]] and released their major label debut ''The Book of Your Regrets''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/music/album/rave+ups/book+of+your+regrets|title=Book Of Your Regrets|date=December 31, 1987|publisher=|accessdate=August 26, 2018}}</ref> to high critical expectations, despite being only promoted to the [[college radio]] scene (albeit a burgeoning one). The album failed to sell many copies, due to Epic's corporate restructuring with Sony and lack of promotion. The label almost dropped the band but a few believers from Epic insisted that the band get another opportunity. That same year, their song \"Class Tramp\" appeared in the cult horror anthology film ''[[From a Whisper to a Scream (film)|From a Whisper to a Scream]]''.\n\n1990 saw the release of the album ''Chance''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/music/album/rave+ups/chance|title=Chance|date=January 1, 1990|publisher=|accessdate=August 26, 2018}}</ref> (named after Podrasky's son with Beth Ringwald) to slightly more commercial success. The single \"Respectfully King of Rain\" became a modest alternative rock hit, garnering some video airplay on MTV and peaking at No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. The second single, a radio-friendly pop anthem called \"(She Says) Come Around\" was readied for distribution (including a music video) by Epic who then decided that they would not promote the single or video and, soon after, dropped the band from the label. The band continued working for a few months, including an appearance on an episode of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' (\"Spring Dance\") and an opening slot on the [[Indigo Girls]] tour. Podrasky soon found himself in a brief relationship/engagement with 90210s star, Shannon Doherty; however, Podrasky's single-father status (he and Ringwald had split-up many months earlier) didn't gel with a Hollywood lifestyle and the relationship soon ended. Within months, after much frustration, The Rave-Ups unofficially  broke up in 1992.\n\n===Post break up===\nIn 1996-1997, Podrasky briefly formed the band The Lovin' Miserys with [[Concrete Blonde]] drummer [[Harry Rushakoff]], producing the limited pressing CD Happy as Hell, which was released only to radio stations.[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-02-20-ca-30763-story.html] During live shows, they were joined by bass player Sam Bolle from Agent Orange, though in the LA Times interview Jimmer said \u201cOn the album, it's just me and Harry Rushakoff.\u201dIn 2000, members of The Rave-Ups (Podrasky and Wilson) reformed, recording a CD entitled ''The Salmon in the Woods'' which has remained unreleased as of 2012.\n\nOver the years, Wilson has played on stage and in studio with many bands including the Springfield, Missouri all-star band, The Dog People and spending some time with The Ozark Mountain Devils. Jimenez continues to play with and produce various bands in Los Angeles. Blatnik has also spent time playing with The Dancing Hoods (whose guitarist Mark Linkous later formed [[Sparklehorse]]) and The Lonesome Strangers (featuring singer/songwriters Randy Weeks & Jeff Rymes).\n\n===Reformation and future developments===\nPodrasky and Wilson continued to maintain a musical partnership, writing and performing occasionally over the following years. In August 2007, with Jimenez and Blatnik back in the rhythm section, the band re-grouped to play some shows in the Los Angeles area. Since then, they've occasionally performed in southern California, but have yet to release any brand new material. Rumors of a new Rave-Ups record continue to tease diehard fans of the band.\n\nJimmer Podrasky recorded his first solo album with drummer/producer Mitch Marine, guitarist/songwriter Brian Whelan and bassist/songwriter Ted Russell Kamp; the album is ''\"The Would-Be Plans\"'' and was released through JimmerMusic.com in September 2013. According to an interview with MSN Music, Podrasky had intended the album to be a Rave-Ups reunion but couldn't get the other band members on board. Though he had the right to release it as a Rave-Ups record, he felt it wouldn't be right, so it's his first official solo album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/post--rave-ups-leader-back-with-blistering-new-music|accessdate=August 26, 2018|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925220659/http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/post--rave-ups-leader-back-with-blistering-new-music|archive-date=September 25, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nPodrasky has since recorded his second solo album and is working on its completion and release.\n\nIn late 2015, The Rave-Ups approached Omnivore Recordings about re-releasing the ''\"Town + Country\"'' album as part of the 30th anniversary of the initial Fun Stuff Records release. On July 8, 2016, the re-release became a reality. This reissue of ''\"Town + Country\"'' features the original 10 songs, plus a whopping 11 previously unissued bonus tracks \u2014 including live radio performances recorded for Dierdre O'Donoghue's influential \"SNAP\" program on Los Angeles\u2019 legendary KCRW-FM, as well as 1986 material produced by Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) and Mark Linett. A detailed historical essay from the band's Jimmer Podrasky, complemented by numerous unseen photos from the sessions/era, make this not only a document of time + place, but one that helps document a moment in musical history. Mastering and restoration was overseen by Grammy\u00ae winner Gavin Lurssen.\n\nAccording to Podrasky from the liners: \u201cMusic has the uncanny ability to thwart time and space. It informs a moment. It indexes lives. It creates strange bedfellows. It outlasts people \u2014 even the people who helped make the music. Music resonates more than any other art form \u2014 that is its unique power. It remains with us long after the last note has faded. ''\"Town + Country\"'' was the beginning of a lifelong journey for me \u2014 the start of a trip that still hasn\u2019t ended. I\u2019m proud and honored to have been a part of something that has withstood the test of time.\u201d\n\n''Town + Country'' is available at [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]], [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].\n\nJimmer Podrasky is a first cousin of the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, [[John Roberts]].\n\n==Band members==\n;Main line-up (1984-92)\n*Jimmer Podrasky \u2013 guitar, vocals\n*Tim Jimenez \u2013 drums\n*Terry Wilson \u2013 guitar\n*Tommy Blatnik \u2013 bass\n\n;All members\n*Jimmer Podrasky \u2013 guitar, vocals (1979-80, 1982-92)\n*Michael Kaniecki \u2013 guitar, vocals (1979-80)\n*George Carter \u2013 bass, violin, vocals (1979-80)\n*T.J.

Devices of this form are commonly called a 'traditional laptop' or notebook, particularly if they have a screen size of 11 to 17 inches measured diagonally and run a full-featured operating system like [[Windows 10]], [[macOS]], or [[GNU]]/[[Linux_kernel|Linux]]. Traditional laptops are the most common form of laptops, although [[Chromebook]]s, Ultrabooks, convertibles and 2-in-1s (described below) are becoming more common, with similar performance being achieved in their more portable or affordable forms.\n\n===Subnotebook===\n{{Main|Subnotebook}}\n\nA ''subnotebook'' or an ''ultraportable'', is a laptop designed and marketed with an emphasis on portability (small size, low weight, and often longer battery life). Subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops, weighing between 0.8 and 2&nbsp;kg (2-5&nbsp;lb),<ref name=\"types_pcmag\" /> with a battery life exceeding 10 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |title=Breaking the Mold: New Lenovo ThinkPad laptop and Tablet PCs Defy Ultraportable Computing |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=Lenovo |date=23 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106182812/http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |archive-date=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the introduction of ''netbooks'' and ''ultrabooks'', the line between ''subnotebooks'' and either category has blurred. Netbooks are a more basic and cheaper type of subnotebook, and while some ultrabooks have a screen size too large to qualify as subnotebooks, certain ultrabooks fit in the subnotebook category. One notable example of a subnotebook is the [[Apple MacBook Air]].\n\n===Netbook===\n{{main|Netbook}}\n\nThe netbook is an inexpensive, light-weight, energy-efficient form of laptop, especially suited for wireless communication and Internet access.<ref name=\"upenn\">{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-net-impact-of-netbooks-it-depends-on-who-uses-them-for-what/|title=The Net Impact of Netbooks?

The ''hybrids'', ''convertibles'' and ''2-in-1s'' emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a [[touchscreen]] display designed to allow users to work in a ''tablet'' mode, using either [[multi-touch]] gestures or a [[stylus (computing)|stylus]]/[[digital pen]].\n\n''Convertibles'' are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. ''Hybrids'' have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. ''2-in-1s'' can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed ''2-in-1 detachables'' and ''2-in-1 convertibles'' respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop [[operating system|OS]], such as [[Windows 10]]. 2-in-1s are often marketed as ''laptop replacement tablets''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/best-2-in-1-pcs-in-2020-when-you-need-a-laptop-and-tablet-in-one/|title=Best 2-in-1 PCs in 2020 for when you need a laptop and tablet in one|website=CNet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>.\n\n2-in-1s are often very thin, around {{convert|10|mm}}, and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an [[x86]]-architecture [[CPU]] (typically a low- or [[Ultra-low-voltage processor|ultra-low-voltage]] model), such as the Intel [[Intel Core|Core i5]], run a full-featured desktop [[operating system|OS]] like [[Windows 10]], and have a number of typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]].\n\n2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a [[media consumption]] device, but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run ''desktop'' applications, such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It is possible to connect multiple [[peripheral]] devices, such as a mouse, keyboard and a number of external displays to a modern 2-in-1.\n\n[[Microsoft Surface]] Pro-series devices and [[Surface Book]] are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachables, whereas [[Lenovo Yoga]]-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older [[Surface RT]] and [[Surface 2]] have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]] and [[Windows RT]] do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/laptop-faqs/what-is-hybrid/|title=What Is a Hybrid Laptop? {{!}} Advantages & Buying Guide {{!}} Lenovo US|website=www.lenovo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a [[mobile operating system]], such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. These include [[Asus Transformer|Asus's Transformer Pad]] devices, examples of [[hybrid tablet|hybrids]] with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall in the category of 2-in-1s.\n\n===Desktop replacement===\n{{Main|Desktop replacement computer}}\n{{See also|Gaming computer#Gaming laptop computers}}\n\nA desktop-replacement laptop is a class of large device which is not intended primarily for mobile use. These devices are bulkier and not as portable as other laptops, and are intended for use as compact and transportable alternatives to a desktop computer.<ref name=\"types_cnet\">{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7602_7-1016082-2.html |title=Laptop Buying Guide |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. }}</ref> Desktop replacements are larger and typically heavier than other classes of laptops. They are capable of containing more powerful components and have a 15-inch or larger display.<ref name=\"types_cnet\"/> Desktop replacement laptops' operation time on batteries is typically shorter than other laptops; in rare cases they have no [[battery (electricity)|battery]] at all. In the past, some laptops in this class used a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance for the same price at the expense of battery life, although this practice has largely died out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com/2100-1040-979763.html |title=Desktop notebooks stake their claim |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |date=8 January 2003 }}</ref> The names ''Media Center Laptops'' and ''Gaming Laptops'' are used to describe specialized notebook computers, often overlapping with the desktop replacement form factor.<ref name=\"types_pcmag\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2311016,00.asp |title= Types of Laptops: How Do You Compute |accessdate=7 November 2008 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc. |date=18 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Rugged laptop===\n{{Main|Rugged computer}}\n\nA rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are usually designed from scratch, rather than adapted from regular consumer laptop models. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/rugged-laptop.html |title=Rugged Laptop: Choices, Pointers &amp; Specs of Buying Rugged Laptops |accessdate=27 November 2008 |publisher=Linux-on-laptops.com}}</ref> and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.\n\nThe design features found in rugged laptops include a rubber sheeting under the keyboard keys, sealed port and connector covers, passive cooling, very bright displays easily readable in daylight, cases and frames made of lightweight magnesium alloys that are much stronger than plastics found in commercial laptops, and solid-state storage devices or hard disk drives that are shock mounted to withstand constant vibrations. Rugged laptops are commonly used by public safety services (police, fire, and medical emergency), military, utilities, field service technicians, construction, mining, and oil drilling personnel. Rugged laptops are usually sold to organizations rather than individuals, and are rarely marketed via retail channels.\n\n===Business laptop===\nA business laptop is a laptop designed for those in a workplace. Typically, it is ruggedised, with consumer facing features, like high resolution [[sound card|sound]], removed to allow the device to be used for pure productivity. It may sometimes include business oriented features like [[Trusted Platform Module]], [[Fingerprint|fingerprint scanner]], [[smart card|smart card reader]] and/or a [[pointing stick]].\n\n==Hardware==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016|small=y}}\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n[[Image:Motherboards.png|thumb|right|Miniaturization: a comparison of a desktop computer motherboard ([[ATX]] form factor) to a motherboard from a 13\" laptop (2008 unibody [[Macbook]])]]\n[[Image:Laptop innen.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a [[VAIO|Sony VAIO]] laptop]]\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SODIMM]] memory module]]\n\nThe basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] and adapted to mobile use, although desktop systems increasingly use the same smaller, lower-power parts which were originally developed for mobile use. The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=D\u00e9 specialist voor smartphone, tablet en laptop reparaties|title=Laptop reparatie|url=https://www.smart-repair.nl/laptop/|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Smartrepair Den Bosch, Nijmegen, Tilburg, Almere en Utrecht|agency=www.smart-repair.nl|date=4 January 2013|language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable, with the exception of components which can be detached, such as a battery or CD/CDR/DVD drive. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large \"tower\" cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new [[motherboard]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and other components can be added. In a very compact laptop, such as laplets, there may be no upgradeable components at all.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+3+Teardown/26595|website=iFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]], and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards and inability to upgrade components.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Building Blocks Platform,|url=http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516184350/http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2006|publisher=Intel|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe following sections summarizes the differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in comparison to desktop personal computer parts.<ref name=\"parts-kate\">{{cite web |title = What Makes Laptops Work&nbsp;\u2013 The Laptop Motherboard |url = http://mobileoffice.about.com/od/laptopstabletpcs/tp/laptopmotherboards.htm |author = Catherine Roseberry |publisher = About.com |accessdate =15 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Display===\nInternally, a display is an LCD panel which could be CCFL or LED [[Backlight|backlit]] which interfaces to the laptop using the [[LVDS]] protocol, while externally, it can be a glossy screen or a matte screen. Most modern laptops feature a {{convert|13|in|cm}} [[viewable image size|VIS]] or larger color [[active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix display]] based on [[LED]] lighting with resolutions of 1280\u00d7800 ([[16:10]]) or 1366\u00d7768 ([[16:9]]) pixels and above. Models with LED-based lighting offer lower power consumption and often increased brightness. [[Netbook]]s with a {{convert|10|in|cm}} or smaller screen typically use a resolution of 1024\u00d7600, while netbooks and [[subnotebook]]s with an {{convert|11.6|in|cm}} or {{convert|12|in|cm}} screen use standard notebook resolutions. Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user's ability to multitask, although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area. Since the introduction of the [[MacBook Pro with Retina display]] in 2012, there has been an increase in the availability of very-high-resolution (1920\u00d71080 and higher) displays, even in relatively small systems, and in typical 15-inch screens resolutions as high as 3200\u00d71800 are available. External displays can be connected to most laptops, and models with a [[Mini DisplayPort]] can handle up to three.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\"/>\n\n===Central processing unit===\nA laptop's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) has advanced power-saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use. Typically, laptop CPUs made after 2018 have four processor cores, although 6-core and 8-core models are also available. For low price and mainstream performance, there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs, but at the high end, the fastest desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest laptop processors, at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat, while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts.\n\nThere have been a wide range of [[notebook processors|CPUs designed for laptops]] available from both [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and other manufacturers. On non-[[x86]] architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former [[PowerPC]]-based Apple laptops ([[iBook]] and [[PowerBook]]). Many laptops have removable CPUs, although this has become less common in the past few years as the trend has been towards thinner and lighter models. In other laptops the CPU is soldered on the motherboard and is non-replaceable; this is nearly universal in ultrabooks.\n\nIn the past, some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have had high performance gains at the cost of greater weight, heat, and limited battery life, but the practice was largely extinct as of 2013. Unlike their desktop counterparts, laptop CPUs are nearly impossible to [[overclocking|overclock]]. A thermal operating mode of laptops is very close to its limits and there is almost no headroom for an overclocking\u2013related operating temperature increase. The possibility of improving a cooling system of a laptop to allow overclocking is extremely difficult to implement.\n\n===Graphical processing unit===\nOn most laptops a [[graphical processing unit]] (GPU) is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the [[Intel Core|Core i-series]] of mobile processors in 2010, and similar [[accelerated processing unit]] (APU) processors by AMD later that year. Prior to that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the [[chipset#Computers|system chipset]], while higher end machines had a separate graphics processor. In the past, laptops lacking a separate graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors in the past few years. Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated, and in some cases even dual, graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is no demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient integrated graphics processor will be used. [[Nvidia Optimus]] and [[AMD Hybrid Graphics]] are examples of this sort of system of switchable graphics.\n\n===Memory===\nMost laptops use [[SO-DIMM]] (small outline dual in-line memory module) [[random-access memory|memory]] modules, as they are about half the size of desktop [[DIMM]]s.<ref name=\"parts-kate\"/> They are sometimes accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading, or placed in locations not intended for user replacement. Most laptops have two memory slots, although some of the lowest-end models will have only one, and some high end models (usually mobile engineering workstations and a few high-end models intended for gaming) have four slots. Most mid-range laptops are factory equipped with 4-8 GB of RAM. with higher-end laptops containing 16 GB of RAM or more. Netbooks are commonly equipped with only 1\u20132 GB of RAM and are generally only expandable to 2 GB, if at all. Laptops may have memory soldered to the motherboard to conserve space, which allows the laptop to have a thinner chassis design. Soldered memory cannot be easily upgraded.\n\n===Internal storage===\nTraditionally, laptops had a [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) as a main [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile storage]], but these proved inefficient for use in mobile devices due to high power consumption, heat production, and a presence of moving parts, which can cause damage to both the drive itself and the data stored when a laptop is unstable physically, e.g. during its use while transporting it or after its accidental drop. With the advent of [[flash memory]] technology, most mid- to high-end laptops opted for more compact, power efficient, and fast [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD), which eliminated the hazard of drive and data corruption caused by a laptop's physical impacts.<ref name=PCW-SSD>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=Evolution of the Solid-State Drive|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/evolution_of_the_solid_state_drive.html|website=PCWorld.com|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=17 January 2012}}</ref>  Most laptops use 2.5-inch drives, which are a smaller version of a 3.5-inch desktop drive form factor. 2.5-inch HDDs are more compact, power efficient, and produce less heat, while at the same time have a smaller capacity and a slower [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics#Data transfer rate|data transfer rate]]. Some very compact laptops support even smaller 1.8-inch HDDs. For SSDs, however, these miniaturization-related trade-offs are nonexistent, because SSDs were designed to have a very small footprint. SSDs feature a traditional 2.5- or 1.8-inch or a laptop-specific [[mSATA]] or [[M.2]] card's form factor.

However, HDDs have a significantly lower cost.\n\nMost laptops can contain a single 2.5-inch drive, but a small number of laptops with a screen wider than 15 inches can house two drives. Some laptops support a hybrid mode, combining a 2.5-inch drive, typically a spacious HDD for data, with an mSATA or M.2 SDD drive, typically having less capacity, but a significantly faster read/write speed. The [[operating system]] partition would be located on the SSD to increase laptop [[I/O]] performance. Another way to increase performance is to use a smaller SSD of 16-32 GB as a [[Hybrid drive#Dual-drive hybrid systems|cache drive]] with a compatible OS. Some laptops may have very limited drive upgradeability when the [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] used has a non-standard shape or requires a proprietary daughter card.<ref name=\"IFI-rMBP\">{{cite web|title=MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Late 2013 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18696|website=IFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> Some laptops have very limited space on the installed SSD, instead relying on availability of [[cloud storage]] services for storing of user data; [[Chromebooks]] are a prominent example of this approach. A variety of [[Hard disk drive#External hard disk drives|external HDDs]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] data storage servers with support of [[RAID]] technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[eSATA]], or [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], or over a wired or wireless network to further increase space for the storage of data. Many laptops also incorporate a [[card reader]] which allows for use of [[memory card]]s, such as those used for [[digital camera]]s, which are typically [[Secure Digital|SD]] or [[microSD]] cards. This enables users to download digital pictures from an SD card onto a laptop, thus enabling them to delete the SD card's contents to free up space for taking new pictures.\n\n===Removable media drive===\n[[Optical disc drive]]s capable of playing [[CD-ROM]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CD), [[DVD#DVD drives and players|DVDs]], and in some cases, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray disc]]s (BD),  were nearly universal on full-sized models by the early 2010s. A disc drive remains fairly common in laptops with a screen wider than {{convert|15|in|cm}}, although the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating these drives and players; these drives are uncommon in compact laptops, such as subnotebooks and netbooks. Laptop optical drives tend to follow a standard form factor, and usually have a standard [[mSATA]] connector. It is often possible to replace an optical drive with a newer model. In certain laptop models there is a possibility to replace an optical drive with a second hard drive, using a caddy that fills the extra space the optical drive would have occupied.\n\n===Inputs===\n[[File:Acer CB5-311 series touchpad.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a [[touchpad]] on an [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] laptop]]\n[[File:Trackpoint Assembly.JPG|thumb|200px|Closeup of a [[TrackPoint]] cursor and UltraNav buttons on a [[ThinkPad]] laptop]]\nAn alphanumeric keyboard is used to enter text and data and make other commands (e.g., [[function key]]s). A [[touchpad]] (also called a trackpad), a [[pointing stick]], or both, are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, and an integrated keyboard<ref>Most keyboards are not illuminated. Some models of laptop feature an illuminated keyboard.</ref> is used for typing. An external keyboard and mouse may be connected using a [[USB]] port or wirelessly, via [[Bluetooth]] or similar technology. With the advent of ultrabooks and support of touch input on screens by 2010-era operating systems, such as [[Windows 8.1]], [[multitouch]] [[touchscreen]] displays are used in many models. Some models have [[webcam]]s and [[microphone]]s, which can be used to communicate with other people with both moving images and sound, via [[Skype]], [[Google Hangouts Chat|Google Chat]] and similar software.\nLaptops typically have USB ports and a microphone jack, for use with an external mic. Some laptops have a [[card reader]] for reading digital camera SD cards.\n\n===Input/output (I/O) ports===\nOn a typical laptop there are several [[USB]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s, an external monitor port ([[VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]] or [[Mini DisplayPort]]), an audio in/out port (often in form of a single socket) is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, utilizing [[DisplayPort#Multi-Stream Transport|multi-stream transport]] technology.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Configuration 3-Displays FAQ|url=http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-033714.htm|website=Intel.com|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], in a 2015 version of its [[MacBook]], transitioned from a number of different [[I/O]] ports to a single [[USB-C]] port.<ref name=MacBook_2015>{{cite web|title=Apple \u2014 MacBook \u2014 Tech Specs|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/|website=apple.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] adapters.

[[Legacy port]]s such as a [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard/mouse port, [[serial port]], [[parallel port]], or [[FireWire]] are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] ports, but [[Thunderbolt 3]] uses USB-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect external headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.\n\n===Expansion cards===\nIn the past, a [[PC Card]] (formerly [[PCMCIA]]) or [[ExpressCard]] slot for expansion was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality, even when the laptop is powered on; these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of [[USB 3.0]]. Some internal subsystems such as: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards, usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop. The standard for such cards is [[PCI Express]], which comes in both [[PCI Express Mini Card|mini]] and even smaller [[M.2]] sizes. In newer laptops, it is not uncommon to also see [[Micro SATA#mSATA|Micro SATA]] (mSATA) functionality on PCI Express Mini or M.2 card slots allowing the use of those slots for SATA-based solid state drives.<ref name=\"parts-cards\">{{cite web|title=Innovations in Notebook Expansion |url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428031253/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89  |archive-date=28 April 2005 |author=Gabriel Torres |date=25 November 2004 |publisher=Hardware Secrets, LLC |accessdate=15 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Battery and power supply ===\n{{Main|Smart battery}}\n[[File:HP Laptop Battery.jpg|thumb|Almost all laptops use [[Smart battery|smart batteries]]]]\n2016-era laptops use [[lithium ion]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], with some thinner models using the flatter [[lithium polymer]] technology. These two technologies have largely replaced the older [[nickel metal-hydride]] batteries. Battery life is highly variable by model and workload and can range from one hour to nearly a day. A battery's performance gradually decreases over time; substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |title=HP EliteBook 6930p Notebook PC specifications \u2013 HP Products and Services Products |publisher=H10010.www1.hp.com |date=25 May 2009 |access-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103622/http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA laptop's battery is charged using an external [[power supply]], which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically in the range of 7.2\u201424 volts. The power supply is usually external and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about {{convert|400|g|lb}} to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a [[smart battery]], a rechargeable [[battery pack]] with a built-in [[battery management system]] (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and State of Health (SoH) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Waste heat]] from operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. Early laptops used [[heat sink]]s placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on [[heat pipe]]s to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. It is believed that some designs with metal cases, like Apple's aluminum [[MacBook Pro]] and [[MacBook Air]], also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink, allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core. Secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with laptops to reduce operating temperatures.\n\n===Docking station===\n[[Image:Docking station 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Docking station and laptop]]\n\nA [[docking station]] (sometimes referred to simply as a ''dock'') is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports, and in some cases expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to \"[[Road warrior (computing)|road warrior]]\" employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a [[Docking station#Port replicator|port replicator]]. These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through [[USB]] or [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]].\n\n===Charging trolleys===\n[[Laptop charging trolley]]s, also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple [[laptops]], [[netbooks]], and [[tablet computer]]s at the same time. The trolleys are used in schools that have replaced their traditional static computer labs<ref name=\"doug\">{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Dough|title=Getting rid of the ICT suite|url=http://dougwoods.co.uk/blog/getting-rid-of-the-ict-suite/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006051528/http://dougwoods.co.uk/blog/getting-rid-of-the-ict-suite/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 October 2010|work=Blog}}</ref> suites of desktop equipped with \"tower\" computers, but do not have enough plug sockets in an individual classroom to charge all of the devices.

Schools, especially those with [[open plan]] designs, are often prime targets for [[thieves]] who steal high-value items. Laptops, netbooks, and tablets are among the highest\u2013value portable items in a school. Moreover, laptops can easily be concealed under clothing and stolen from buildings. Many types of laptop\u2013charging trolleys are designed and constructed to protect against theft. They are generally made out of steel, and the laptops remain locked up while not in use. Although the trolleys can be moved between areas from one classroom to another, they can often be mounted or locked to the floor or walls to prevent thieves from stealing the laptops, especially overnight.<ref name=\"doug\" />\n\n===Solar panels===\n{{main|Solar notebook}}\n\nIn some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Gavin|title=The SOLAR-POWERED Ubuntu laptop|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/07/ubuntu_solar_powered_laptop/|publisher=THE REGISTER|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> The [[One Laptop Per Child]] Initiative released the [[OLPC XO-1]] laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITHNbOrPQyM |title=OLPC XO laptop powered by a solar panel |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Presently, they are designing an [[OLPC XO-3]] laptop with these features.

Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of [[neoprene]], with sturdier ones made of [[LRPu|low-resilience polyurethane]]. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in [[ballistic nylon]] to provide some measure of [[waterproofing]]. Bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a [[laptop cooler]], a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow. Some stores sell laptop pads which enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.\n\n===Changes in certain features===\n\nSome of the components of earlier models of laptops can easily be replaced without opening completely its bottom part, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc.\n\nSome of the components of recent models of laptop reside inside. Replacing most of its components, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc., requires removal of its either top or bottom part, removal of motherboard, and returning them back.\n\n===Obsolete features===\n[[File:3Com modem - Ethernet PCMCIA in IBM 9547.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[modem]] [[PCMCIA]] card on an old ThinkPad]]\n\nFeatures that certain early models of laptops used to have that are not available in most current laptops include:\n* Reset (\"cold restart\") button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Instant power off button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Integrated charger or power adapter inside the laptop\n* [[Floppy disk drive]]\n* [[Serial port]]\n* [[Parallel port]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* Shared [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] input device port\n* [[VHS]] or [[8 mm video format|8mm]] VCR\n* [[IrDA]]\n* [[S-video]] port{{NoteTag|Unconfirmed if this exists in most recent models of laptops.}}\n* [[PC Card]] / [[PCMCIA]] slot\n* [[ExpressCard]] slot\n* [[CD Drive|CD/DVD Drives]] (starting with 2013 models)\n* [[VGA port]] (starting with 2013 models)\n\n==Comparison with desktops==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File:Astrid Gruppefremvisning.jpg|thumb|A teacher using laptop as part of a workshop for school children]]\n[[File:Jimmy Wales accessing Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] using a laptop on a park bench]]\n\n'''Portability''' is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop PCs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Should I buy a laptop or desktop? | publisher = IT Division&nbsp;\u2013 University of Wisconsin | date = 19 March 2008 | url = http://kb.wisc.edu/showroom/page.php?id=3044 | accessdate =27 November 2008 }}</ref> Physical portability allows a laptop to be used in many places\u2014not only at home and at the office, but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients' locations or at a meeting room, etc. Within a home, portability enables laptop users to move their device from the living room to the dining room to the family room. Portability offers several distinct advantages:\n* '''Productivity''': Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used can help employees and students to increase their productivity on work or school tasks. For example, an office worker reading their work e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, or a student doing their homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures.\n* '''Immediacy''': Carrying a laptop means having instant access to information, including personal and work files. This allows better collaboration between coworkers or students, as a laptop can be flipped open to look at a report, document, spreadsheet, or presentation anytime and anywhere.\n* '''Up-to-date information''': If a person has more than one desktop PC, a problem of synchronization arises: changes made on one computer are not automatically propagated to the others. There are ways to resolve this problem, including physical transfer of updated files (using a USB flash memory stick or CD-ROMs) or using synchronization software over the Internet, such as [[cloud computing]]. However, transporting a single laptop to both locations avoids the problem entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.\n* '''Connectivity''': In the 2010s, a proliferation of [[Wi-Fi]] wireless networks and cellular broadband data services ([[HSDPA]], [[EVDO]] and others) in many urban centers, combined with near-ubiquitous Wi-Fi support by modern laptops{{NoteTag|Almost all laptops contain a Wi-Fi interface; broadband cellular devices are available widely as extension cards and USB devices, and also as internal cards in select models.}} meant that a laptop could now have easy [[Internet]] and local network connectivity while remaining mobile. Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Faster Wi-Fi Predicted for Colleges | newspaper = The Chronicle of Higher Education | author = Josh Fischman | date = 7 August 2008| url = http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3226/faster-wifi-predicted-for-colleges | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of laptops:\n* '''Size''': Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away in a desk drawer.\n* '''Low power consumption''': Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20\u2013120 W, compared to 100\u2013800 W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for large businesses, which run hundreds of personal computers thus multiplying the potential savings, and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.).\n* '''Quiet''': Laptops are typically much quieter than desktops, due both to the components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.\n* '''Battery''': a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts. A desktop PC needs an [[Uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) to handle short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving on-battery time of more than 20\u201330 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS.<ref>A sample line of UPS devices and on-battery power: {{cite web | title = Back-UPS RS | publisher = APC | url = http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=23 | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* '''All-in-One''': designed to be portable, most 2010-era laptops have all components integrated into the chassis (however, some small laptops may not have an internal CD/CDR/DVD drive, so an external drive needs to be used). For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is divided into the desktop \"tower\" (the unit with the CPU, hard drive, power supply, etc.), keyboard, mouse, display screen, and optional peripherals such as speakers.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCompared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:\n\n====Performance====\nWhile the performance of mainstream desktops and laptop is comparable, and the cost of laptops has fallen less rapidly than desktops, laptops remain more expensive than desktop PCs at the same performance level.<ref>In a comparison between laptop and desktop of equal cost, the desktop's System Benchmark Score was twice that of the laptop. {{cite web | title = What to Buy, a Notebook or Desktop PC? | publisher = Tom's Hardware | date = 11 June 2008 | url = http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/desktop-vs-notebook,1946-7.html | accessdate =28 November 2008}}</ref> The upper limits of performance of laptops remain much lower than the highest-end desktops (especially \"workstation class\" machines with two processor sockets), and \"bleeding-edge\" features usually appear first in desktops and only then, as the underlying technology matures, are adapted to laptops.\n\nFor Internet browsing and typical office applications, where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input, even relatively low-end laptops (such as Netbooks) can be fast enough for some users.<ref>For example, a review of the [[MSI Wind Netbook]] says that \"''The device is rarely sluggish in general use. It renders Web pages quickly, launches most applications without becoming too bogged down and generally doesn't feel like it's a budget laptop.''\" {{cite web | last = Reid | first = Rory | title = MSI Wind Review | publisher = CNET Australia | date = 7 July 2008 | url = http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | accessdate = 28 November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205092148/http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | archivedate = 5 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Most higher-end laptops are sufficiently powerful for high-resolution movie playback, some 3D gaming and video editing and encoding. However, laptop processors can be disadvantaged when dealing with a higher-end database, maths, engineering, financial software, virtualization, etc. This is because laptops use the mobile versions of processors to conserve power, and these lag behind desktop chips when it comes to performance. Some manufacturers work around this performance problem by using desktop CPUs for laptops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/07/14/rock-delivers-bd-core-i7-equipped-xtreme-790-and-xtreme-840-ga/|title=Rock delivers BD / Core i7-equipped Xtreme 790 and Xtreme 840 gaming laptops|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n====Upgradeability====\nUpgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops, which are thoroughly standardized. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Optical drives and [[internal expansion card]]s may be upgraded if they follow an [[Technical standard|industry standard]], but all other internal components, including the motherboard, CPU and graphics, are not always intended to be upgradeable. [[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]] and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards. The reasons for limited upgradeability are both technical and economic. There is no industry-wide standard [[Computer form factor|form factor]] for laptops; each major laptop manufacturer pursues its own [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] design and construction, with the result that laptops are difficult to upgrade and have high repair costs. Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SDD, RAM, Keyboard...) in order to reduce size and upgradeability prospects. Devices such as sound cards, network adapters, hard and optical drives, and numerous other peripherals are available, but these upgrades usually impair the laptop's portability, because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is on the move.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ergonomics and health effects====\n\n=====Wrists=====\n[[Image:laptop-coaster.jpg|thumb|[[Laptop cooler]] (silver) under laptop (white), preventing heating of lap and improving laptop airflow]]\n\nProlonged use of laptops can cause [[repetitive strain injury]] because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices,.<ref>{{cite web| last = Toub| first = Allegra| title = Take It Easy on Those Keyboards| publisher = Backlight Resumes| date = 23 May 2017| url = http://blog.backlightresumes.com/take-it-easy-on-those-keyboards| accessdate = 23 May 2017}}</ref> Usage of separate, external [[ergonomic keyboard]]s and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.\n\n=====Neck and spine=====\nA laptop's integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view, which can cause neck or spinal injuries. A larger and higher-quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate this and to provide additional screen space for more productive work. Another solution is to use a [[Docking station#Computer stands|computer stand]].\n\n=====Possible effect on fertility=====\nA study by [[State University of New York]] researchers found that heat generated from laptops can increase the temperature of the lap of male users when balancing the computer on their lap, potentially putting [[sperm count]] at risk.

Components such as screen hinges, latches, [[DC connector|power jack]]s, and [[power cord]]s deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and may have to be replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer, result in a costly repair or entire replacement of laptops.

Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geier|first=Eric|title=Zen and the Art of Laptop Maintenance|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260438/zen_and_the_art_of_laptop_maintenance.html|work=PC World|accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===== Parts replacement =====\nOriginal external components are expensive and usually proprietary and non-interchangeable; other parts are inexpensive\u2014a power jack can cost a few dollars\u2014but their replacement may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician. Other inexpensive but fragile parts often cannot be purchased separately from larger more expensive components. For example, the video display cable and the backlight power cable that pass through the lid hinges to connect the motherboard to the screen may eventually break from repeated opening and closing of the lid. These tiny cables usually cannot be purchased from the original manufacturer separate from the entire LCD panel, with the price of hundreds of dollars, although for popular models an aftermarket in pulled parts generally exists. The repair costs of a failed motherboard or LCD panel often exceeds the value of a used laptop. Parts can also be ordered from third party vendors.\n\n=====Heating and cooling=====\nLaptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a [[computer fan|fan]] and [[heat sink]] that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. A complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).\n\n===== Battery life =====\nBattery life is limited because the capacity drops with time, eventually requiring replacement after as little as a year. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours, depending on usage, configuration, and power management settings. Yet, as it ages, the battery's energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and discharging time. Some laptops (specifically ultrabooks) do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have its battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive.\n\n====Security and privacy====\n{{Main|Laptop theft}}\nBecause they are valuable, commonly used, portable, and easy to hide in a backpack or other type of travel bag, laptops are often [[laptop theft|stolen]]. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/services/dell_lost_laptop_study.pdf], Ponemon Institute, Airport Insecurity: The Case of Lost Laptops, June 2008</ref> The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems ([[identity theft]], [[credit card fraud]], breach of privacy), can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself. Consequently, physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance. Most laptops have a [[Kensington security slot]], which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock. In addition, modern operating systems and [[disk encryption software|third-party software]] offer [[disk encryption]] functionality, which renders the data on the laptop's [[hard drive]] unreadable without a [[key (cryptography)|key]] or a passphrase. As of 2015, some laptops also have additional security elements added, including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.laptop-security-pro.com/biometric-devices.html|title= Secure File Sharing|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website= Biometric Devices and Laptop Security|publisher= Laptop Security Pro|accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSoftware such as LoJack for Laptops, Laptop Cop, and GadgetTrack have been engineered to help people locate and recover their stolen laptop in the event of theft. Setting one's laptop with a password on its firmware (protection against going to firmware setup or booting), internal HDD/SSD (protection against accessing it and loading an operating system on it afterwards), and every user account of the operating system are additional security measures that a user should do.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186235/how-to-secure-your-computer-with-a-bios-or-uefi-password/|title=How to Secure Your Computer With a BIOS or UEFI Password|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186881/hard-disk-passwords-explained-should-you-set-one-to-secure-your-files/|title=Hard Disk Passwords Explained: Should You Set One to Secure Your Files?|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref> Fewer than 5% of lost or stolen laptops are recovered by the companies that own them,<ref>[http://www.intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html#.UP2bUFSzBJN#ixzz2Ucm2oKSg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606040557/http://intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html|date=6 June 2013}}, Ponemon Institute, The Billion Dollar Lost Laptop Problem, September 2010</ref> however, that number may decrease due to a variety of companies and software solutions specializing in laptop recovery.

Although these toxins are relatively harmless when the laptop is in use, concerns that discarded laptops cause a serious health risk and toxic environment damage, were so strong, that the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in Europe specified that all laptop computers must be recycled by law. Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ([[Epargyreus clarus|EPA]]) has outlawed [[landfill]] dumping or the incinerating of discarded laptop computers.\n\nMost laptop computers begin the recycling process with a method known as Demanufacturing ([[Demanufacture]]), this involves the physical separation of the components of the laptop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/where_to_recycle/business_laptops/what_to_do_with_used_office_laptops.html|title=Laptop Disposal Ewaste Recycling and IT asset disposition (ITAD)|last=Recycling|first=Newtech|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  These components are then either grouped into materials (e.g. plastic, metal and glass) for recycling or more complex items that require more advanced materials separation (e.g.) circuit boards, hard drives and batteries.\n\nCorporate laptop recycling can require an additional process known as data destruction.

Optical storage, [[read-only memory|read-only]] CD-ROM followed by writeable CD and later read-only or writeable DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] players, became common in laptops early in the 2000s.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Compaqarmada7800.jpg|thumb|[[Compaq]] Armada laptop from the late 1990s]]\n[[File:Macbook Air.jpg|thumb|Apple [[MacBook Air]], an ultraportable laptop weighing under {{convert|3.0|lb|kg|2|abbr=on}}]]\n[[File:ThinkPad X220.jpg|thumb|[[Lenovo]]'s [[ThinkPad]] business laptop, originally an [[IBM]] product]]\n\n[[File:Asus Transformer Pad TF701T Tablet and Keyboard Dock.png|thumb|[[ASUS Transformer|Asus Transformer Pad]], a hybrid tablet, powered by [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Operating system|OS]]]]\n[[File:Microsoft Surface Pro 3 with Type Cover.jpg|thumb|[[Microsoft Surface Pro 3]], 2-in-1 detachable]]\n[[File:Alienware.JPG|thumb|[[Alienware]] gaming laptop]]\n[[Image:Toughbook-cf-m34 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Toughbook|Panasonic Toughbook]] CF-M34, a rugged laptop/subnotebook]]\n\nSince the introduction of portable computers during the late 1970s, their form has changed significantly, [[spawning]] a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses.  Except where there is a distinct legal [[trademark]] around a term (notably [[Ultrabook]]), there are rarely hard distinctions between these classes and their usage has varied over time and between different sources.\n\n===Traditional laptop===\nThe form of the traditional laptop computer is a clamshell, with a screen on one of its inner sides and a keyboard on the opposite, facing the screen. It can be easily folded to conserve space while traveling. The screen and keyboard are inaccessible while closed. Devices of this form are commonly called a 'traditional laptop' or notebook, particularly if they have a screen size of 11 to 17 inches measured diagonally and run a full-featured operating system like [[Windows 10]], [[macOS]], or [[GNU]]/[[Linux_kernel|Linux]]. Traditional laptops are the most common form of laptops, although [[Chromebook]]s, Ultrabooks, convertibles and 2-in-1s (described below) are becoming more common, with similar performance being achieved in their more portable or affordable forms.\n\n===Subnotebook===\n{{Main|Subnotebook}}\n\nA ''subnotebook'' or an ''ultraportable'', is a laptop designed and marketed with an emphasis on portability (small size, low weight, and often longer battery life). Subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops, weighing between 0.8 and 2&nbsp;kg (2-5&nbsp;lb),<ref name=\"types_pcmag\" /> with a battery life exceeding 10 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |title=Breaking the Mold: New Lenovo ThinkPad laptop and Tablet PCs Defy Ultraportable Computing |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=Lenovo |date=23 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106182812/http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |archive-date=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the introduction of ''netbooks'' and ''ultrabooks'', the line between ''subnotebooks'' and either category has blurred.

The ''hybrids'', ''convertibles'' and ''2-in-1s'' emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a [[touchscreen]] display designed to allow users to work in a ''tablet'' mode, using either [[multi-touch]] gestures or a [[stylus (computing)|stylus]]/[[digital pen]].\n\n''Convertibles'' are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. ''Hybrids'' have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. ''2-in-1s'' can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed ''2-in-1 detachables'' and ''2-in-1 convertibles'' respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop [[operating system|OS]], such as [[Windows 10]]. 2-in-1s are often marketed as ''laptop replacement tablets''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/best-2-in-1-pcs-in-2020-when-you-need-a-laptop-and-tablet-in-one/|title=Best 2-in-1 PCs in 2020 for when you need a laptop and tablet in one|website=CNet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>.\n\n2-in-1s are often very thin, around {{convert|10|mm}}, and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an [[x86]]-architecture [[CPU]] (typically a low- or [[Ultra-low-voltage processor|ultra-low-voltage]] model), such as the Intel [[Intel Core|Core i5]], run a full-featured desktop [[operating system|OS]] like [[Windows 10]], and have a number of typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]].\n\n2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a [[media consumption]] device, but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run ''desktop'' applications, such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It is possible to connect multiple [[peripheral]] devices, such as a mouse, keyboard and a number of external displays to a modern 2-in-1.\n\n[[Microsoft Surface]] Pro-series devices and [[Surface Book]] are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachables, whereas [[Lenovo Yoga]]-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older [[Surface RT]] and [[Surface 2]] have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]] and [[Windows RT]] do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/laptop-faqs/what-is-hybrid/|title=What Is a Hybrid Laptop? {{!}} Advantages & Buying Guide {{!}} Lenovo US|website=www.lenovo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a [[mobile operating system]], such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. These include [[Asus Transformer|Asus's Transformer Pad]] devices, examples of [[hybrid tablet|hybrids]] with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall in the category of 2-in-1s.\n\n===Desktop replacement===\n{{Main|Desktop replacement computer}}\n{{See also|Gaming computer#Gaming laptop computers}}\n\nA desktop-replacement laptop is a class of large device which is not intended primarily for mobile use. These devices are bulkier and not as portable as other laptops, and are intended for use as compact and transportable alternatives to a desktop computer.<ref name=\"types_cnet\">{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7602_7-1016082-2.html |title=Laptop Buying Guide |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. }}</ref> Desktop replacements are larger and typically heavier than other classes of laptops.

In the past, some laptops in this class used a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance for the same price at the expense of battery life, although this practice has largely died out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com/2100-1040-979763.html |title=Desktop notebooks stake their claim |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |date=8 January 2003 }}</ref> The names ''Media Center Laptops'' and ''Gaming Laptops'' are used to describe specialized notebook computers, often overlapping with the desktop replacement form factor.<ref name=\"types_pcmag\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2311016,00.asp |title= Types of Laptops: How Do You Compute |accessdate=7 November 2008 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc. |date=18 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Rugged laptop===\n{{Main|Rugged computer}}\n\nA rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are usually designed from scratch, rather than adapted from regular consumer laptop models. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/rugged-laptop.html |title=Rugged Laptop: Choices, Pointers &amp; Specs of Buying Rugged Laptops |accessdate=27 November 2008 |publisher=Linux-on-laptops.com}}</ref> and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.\n\nThe design features found in rugged laptops include a rubber sheeting under the keyboard keys, sealed port and connector covers, passive cooling, very bright displays easily readable in daylight, cases and frames made of lightweight magnesium alloys that are much stronger than plastics found in commercial laptops, and solid-state storage devices or hard disk drives that are shock mounted to withstand constant vibrations. Rugged laptops are commonly used by public safety services (police, fire, and medical emergency), military, utilities, field service technicians, construction, mining, and oil drilling personnel. Rugged laptops are usually sold to organizations rather than individuals, and are rarely marketed via retail channels.\n\n===Business laptop===\nA business laptop is a laptop designed for those in a workplace. Typically, it is ruggedised, with consumer facing features, like high resolution [[sound card|sound]], removed to allow the device to be used for pure productivity. It may sometimes include business oriented features like [[Trusted Platform Module]], [[Fingerprint|fingerprint scanner]], [[smart card|smart card reader]] and/or a [[pointing stick]].\n\n==Hardware==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016|small=y}}\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n[[Image:Motherboards.png|thumb|right|Miniaturization: a comparison of a desktop computer motherboard ([[ATX]] form factor) to a motherboard from a 13\" laptop (2008 unibody [[Macbook]])]]\n[[Image:Laptop innen.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a [[VAIO|Sony VAIO]] laptop]]\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SODIMM]] memory module]]\n\nThe basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] and adapted to mobile use, although desktop systems increasingly use the same smaller, lower-power parts which were originally developed for mobile use. The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=D\u00e9 specialist voor smartphone, tablet en laptop reparaties|title=Laptop reparatie|url=https://www.smart-repair.nl/laptop/|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Smartrepair Den Bosch, Nijmegen, Tilburg, Almere en Utrecht|agency=www.smart-repair.nl|date=4 January 2013|language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable, with the exception of components which can be detached, such as a battery or CD/CDR/DVD drive. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large \"tower\" cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new [[motherboard]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and other components can be added. In a very compact laptop, such as laplets, there may be no upgradeable components at all.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+3+Teardown/26595|website=iFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]], and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards and inability to upgrade components.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Building Blocks Platform,|url=http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516184350/http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2006|publisher=Intel|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe following sections summarizes the differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in comparison to desktop personal computer parts.<ref name=\"parts-kate\">{{cite web |title = What Makes Laptops Work&nbsp;\u2013 The Laptop Motherboard |url = http://mobileoffice.about.com/od/laptopstabletpcs/tp/laptopmotherboards.htm |author = Catherine Roseberry |publisher = About.com |accessdate =15 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Display===\nInternally, a display is an LCD panel which could be CCFL or LED [[Backlight|backlit]] which interfaces to the laptop using the [[LVDS]] protocol, while externally, it can be a glossy screen or a matte screen. Most modern laptops feature a {{convert|13|in|cm}} [[viewable image size|VIS]] or larger color [[active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix display]] based on [[LED]] lighting with resolutions of 1280\u00d7800 ([[16:10]]) or 1366\u00d7768 ([[16:9]]) pixels and above. Models with LED-based lighting offer lower power consumption and often increased brightness. [[Netbook]]s with a {{convert|10|in|cm}} or smaller screen typically use a resolution of 1024\u00d7600, while netbooks and [[subnotebook]]s with an {{convert|11.6|in|cm}} or {{convert|12|in|cm}} screen use standard notebook resolutions. Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user's ability to multitask, although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area. Since the introduction of the [[MacBook Pro with Retina display]] in 2012, there has been an increase in the availability of very-high-resolution (1920\u00d71080 and higher) displays, even in relatively small systems, and in typical 15-inch screens resolutions as high as 3200\u00d71800 are available. External displays can be connected to most laptops, and models with a [[Mini DisplayPort]] can handle up to three.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\"/>\n\n===Central processing unit===\nA laptop's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) has advanced power-saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use. Typically, laptop CPUs made after 2018 have four processor cores, although 6-core and 8-core models are also available. For low price and mainstream performance, there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs, but at the high end, the fastest desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest laptop processors, at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat, while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts.\n\nThere have been a wide range of [[notebook processors|CPUs designed for laptops]] available from both [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and other manufacturers. On non-[[x86]] architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former [[PowerPC]]-based Apple laptops ([[iBook]] and [[PowerBook]]). Many laptops have removable CPUs, although this has become less common in the past few years as the trend has been towards thinner and lighter models. In other laptops the CPU is soldered on the motherboard and is non-replaceable; this is nearly universal in ultrabooks.\n\nIn the past, some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have had high performance gains at the cost of greater weight, heat, and limited battery life, but the practice was largely extinct as of 2013. Unlike their desktop counterparts, laptop CPUs are nearly impossible to [[overclocking|overclock]]. A thermal operating mode of laptops is very close to its limits and there is almost no headroom for an overclocking\u2013related operating temperature increase. The possibility of improving a cooling system of a laptop to allow overclocking is extremely difficult to implement.\n\n===Graphical processing unit===\nOn most laptops a [[graphical processing unit]] (GPU) is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the [[Intel Core|Core i-series]] of mobile processors in 2010, and similar [[accelerated processing unit]] (APU) processors by AMD later that year. Prior to that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the [[chipset#Computers|system chipset]], while higher end machines had a separate graphics processor. In the past, laptops lacking a separate graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors in the past few years. Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated, and in some cases even dual, graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is no demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient integrated graphics processor will be used. [[Nvidia Optimus]] and [[AMD Hybrid Graphics]] are examples of this sort of system of switchable graphics.\n\n===Memory===\nMost laptops use [[SO-DIMM]] (small outline dual in-line memory module) [[random-access memory|memory]] modules, as they are about half the size of desktop [[DIMM]]s.<ref name=\"parts-kate\"/> They are sometimes accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading, or placed in locations not intended for user replacement. Most laptops have two memory slots, although some of the lowest-end models will have only one, and some high end models (usually mobile engineering workstations and a few high-end models intended for gaming) have four slots. Most mid-range laptops are factory equipped with 4-8 GB of RAM. with higher-end laptops containing 16 GB of RAM or more. Netbooks are commonly equipped with only 1\u20132 GB of RAM and are generally only expandable to 2 GB, if at all. Laptops may have memory soldered to the motherboard to conserve space, which allows the laptop to have a thinner chassis design. Soldered memory cannot be easily upgraded.\n\n===Internal storage===\nTraditionally, laptops had a [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) as a main [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile storage]], but these proved inefficient for use in mobile devices due to high power consumption, heat production, and a presence of moving parts, which can cause damage to both the drive itself and the data stored when a laptop is unstable physically, e.g. during its use while transporting it or after its accidental drop. With the advent of [[flash memory]] technology, most mid- to high-end laptops opted for more compact, power efficient, and fast [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD), which eliminated the hazard of drive and data corruption caused by a laptop's physical impacts.<ref name=PCW-SSD>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=Evolution of the Solid-State Drive|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/evolution_of_the_solid_state_drive.html|website=PCWorld.com|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=17 January 2012}}</ref>  Most laptops use 2.5-inch drives, which are a smaller version of a 3.5-inch desktop drive form factor. 2.5-inch HDDs are more compact, power efficient, and produce less heat, while at the same time have a smaller capacity and a slower [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics#Data transfer rate|data transfer rate]]. Some very compact laptops support even smaller 1.8-inch HDDs. For SSDs, however, these miniaturization-related trade-offs are nonexistent, because SSDs were designed to have a very small footprint. SSDs feature a traditional 2.5- or 1.8-inch or a laptop-specific [[mSATA]] or [[M.2]] card's form factor.

The [[operating system]] partition would be located on the SSD to increase laptop [[I/O]] performance. Another way to increase performance is to use a smaller SSD of 16-32 GB as a [[Hybrid drive#Dual-drive hybrid systems|cache drive]] with a compatible OS. Some laptops may have very limited drive upgradeability when the [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] used has a non-standard shape or requires a proprietary daughter card.<ref name=\"IFI-rMBP\">{{cite web|title=MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Late 2013 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18696|website=IFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> Some laptops have very limited space on the installed SSD, instead relying on availability of [[cloud storage]] services for storing of user data; [[Chromebooks]] are a prominent example of this approach. A variety of [[Hard disk drive#External hard disk drives|external HDDs]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] data storage servers with support of [[RAID]] technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[eSATA]], or [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], or over a wired or wireless network to further increase space for the storage of data. Many laptops also incorporate a [[card reader]] which allows for use of [[memory card]]s, such as those used for [[digital camera]]s, which are typically [[Secure Digital|SD]] or [[microSD]] cards. This enables users to download digital pictures from an SD card onto a laptop, thus enabling them to delete the SD card's contents to free up space for taking new pictures.\n\n===Removable media drive===\n[[Optical disc drive]]s capable of playing [[CD-ROM]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CD), [[DVD#DVD drives and players|DVDs]], and in some cases, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray disc]]s (BD),  were nearly universal on full-sized models by the early 2010s. A disc drive remains fairly common in laptops with a screen wider than {{convert|15|in|cm}}, although the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating these drives and players; these drives are uncommon in compact laptops, such as subnotebooks and netbooks. Laptop optical drives tend to follow a standard form factor, and usually have a standard [[mSATA]] connector. It is often possible to replace an optical drive with a newer model. In certain laptop models there is a possibility to replace an optical drive with a second hard drive, using a caddy that fills the extra space the optical drive would have occupied.\n\n===Inputs===\n[[File:Acer CB5-311 series touchpad.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a [[touchpad]] on an [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] laptop]]\n[[File:Trackpoint Assembly.JPG|thumb|200px|Closeup of a [[TrackPoint]] cursor and UltraNav buttons on a [[ThinkPad]] laptop]]\nAn alphanumeric keyboard is used to enter text and data and make other commands (e.g., [[function key]]s). A [[touchpad]] (also called a trackpad), a [[pointing stick]], or both, are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, and an integrated keyboard<ref>Most keyboards are not illuminated. Some models of laptop feature an illuminated keyboard.</ref> is used for typing. An external keyboard and mouse may be connected using a [[USB]] port or wirelessly, via [[Bluetooth]] or similar technology. With the advent of ultrabooks and support of touch input on screens by 2010-era operating systems, such as [[Windows 8.1]], [[multitouch]] [[touchscreen]] displays are used in many models. Some models have [[webcam]]s and [[microphone]]s, which can be used to communicate with other people with both moving images and sound, via [[Skype]], [[Google Hangouts Chat|Google Chat]] and similar software.\nLaptops typically have USB ports and a microphone jack, for use with an external mic. Some laptops have a [[card reader]] for reading digital camera SD cards.\n\n===Input/output (I/O) ports===\nOn a typical laptop there are several [[USB]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s, an external monitor port ([[VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]] or [[Mini DisplayPort]]), an audio in/out port (often in form of a single socket) is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, utilizing [[DisplayPort#Multi-Stream Transport|multi-stream transport]] technology.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Configuration 3-Displays FAQ|url=http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-033714.htm|website=Intel.com|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], in a 2015 version of its [[MacBook]], transitioned from a number of different [[I/O]] ports to a single [[USB-C]] port.<ref name=MacBook_2015>{{cite web|title=Apple \u2014 MacBook \u2014 Tech Specs|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/|website=apple.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] adapters. [[Google]], with its updated version of [[Chromebook Pixel]], shows a similar transition trend towards USB-C, although keeping older USB Type-A ports for a better compatibility with older devices.<ref name=ChromebookPixel_2015>{{cite web|title=Chromebook Pixel|url=https://www.google.com/chromebook/pixel/|website=google.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> Although being common until the end of the 2000s decade, [[Ethernet]] network port are rarely found on modern laptops, due to widespread use of [[wireless network]]ing, such as [[Wi-Fi]]. [[Legacy port]]s such as a [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard/mouse port, [[serial port]], [[parallel port]], or [[FireWire]] are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] ports, but [[Thunderbolt 3]] uses USB-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect external headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.\n\n===Expansion cards===\nIn the past, a [[PC Card]] (formerly [[PCMCIA]]) or [[ExpressCard]] slot for expansion was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality, even when the laptop is powered on; these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of [[USB 3.0]]. Some internal subsystems such as: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards, usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop. The standard for such cards is [[PCI Express]], which comes in both [[PCI Express Mini Card|mini]] and even smaller [[M.2]] sizes. In newer laptops, it is not uncommon to also see [[Micro SATA#mSATA|Micro SATA]] (mSATA) functionality on PCI Express Mini or M.2 card slots allowing the use of those slots for SATA-based solid state drives.<ref name=\"parts-cards\">{{cite web|title=Innovations in Notebook Expansion |url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428031253/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89  |archive-date=28 April 2005 |author=Gabriel Torres |date=25 November 2004 |publisher=Hardware Secrets, LLC |accessdate=15 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Battery and power supply ===\n{{Main|Smart battery}}\n[[File:HP Laptop Battery.jpg|thumb|Almost all laptops use [[Smart battery|smart batteries]]]]\n2016-era laptops use [[lithium ion]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], with some thinner models using the flatter [[lithium polymer]] technology. These two technologies have largely replaced the older [[nickel metal-hydride]] batteries. Battery life is highly variable by model and workload and can range from one hour to nearly a day. A battery's performance gradually decreases over time; substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |title=HP EliteBook 6930p Notebook PC specifications \u2013 HP Products and Services Products |publisher=H10010.www1.hp.com |date=25 May 2009 |access-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103622/http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA laptop's battery is charged using an external [[power supply]], which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically in the range of 7.2\u201424 volts. The power supply is usually external and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about {{convert|400|g|lb}} to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a [[smart battery]], a rechargeable [[battery pack]] with a built-in [[battery management system]] (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and State of Health (SoH) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Waste heat]] from operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. Early laptops used [[heat sink]]s placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on [[heat pipe]]s to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. It is believed that some designs with metal cases, like Apple's aluminum [[MacBook Pro]] and [[MacBook Air]], also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink, allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core. Secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with laptops to reduce operating temperatures.\n\n===Docking station===\n[[Image:Docking station 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Docking station and laptop]]\n\nA [[docking station]] (sometimes referred to simply as a ''dock'') is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports, and in some cases expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to \"[[Road warrior (computing)|road warrior]]\" employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a [[Docking station#Port replicator|port replicator]]. These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through [[USB]] or [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]].\n\n===Charging trolleys===\n[[Laptop charging trolley]]s, also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple [[laptops]], [[netbooks]], and [[tablet computer]]s at the same time.

Schools, especially those with [[open plan]] designs, are often prime targets for [[thieves]] who steal high-value items. Laptops, netbooks, and tablets are among the highest\u2013value portable items in a school. Moreover, laptops can easily be concealed under clothing and stolen from buildings. Many types of laptop\u2013charging trolleys are designed and constructed to protect against theft. They are generally made out of steel, and the laptops remain locked up while not in use. Although the trolleys can be moved between areas from one classroom to another, they can often be mounted or locked to the floor or walls to prevent thieves from stealing the laptops, especially overnight.<ref name=\"doug\" />\n\n===Solar panels===\n{{main|Solar notebook}}\n\nIn some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Gavin|title=The SOLAR-POWERED Ubuntu laptop|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/07/ubuntu_solar_powered_laptop/|publisher=THE REGISTER|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> The [[One Laptop Per Child]] Initiative released the [[OLPC XO-1]] laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITHNbOrPQyM |title=OLPC XO laptop powered by a solar panel |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Presently, they are designing an [[OLPC XO-3]] laptop with these features.

Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of [[neoprene]], with sturdier ones made of [[LRPu|low-resilience polyurethane]]. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in [[ballistic nylon]] to provide some measure of [[waterproofing]]. Bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a [[laptop cooler]], a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow. Some stores sell laptop pads which enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.\n\n===Changes in certain features===\n\nSome of the components of earlier models of laptops can easily be replaced without opening completely its bottom part, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc.\n\nSome of the components of recent models of laptop reside inside. Replacing most of its components, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc., requires removal of its either top or bottom part, removal of motherboard, and returning them back.\n\n===Obsolete features===\n[[File:3Com modem - Ethernet PCMCIA in IBM 9547.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[modem]] [[PCMCIA]] card on an old ThinkPad]]\n\nFeatures that certain early models of laptops used to have that are not available in most current laptops include:\n* Reset (\"cold restart\") button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Instant power off button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Integrated charger or power adapter inside the laptop\n* [[Floppy disk drive]]\n* [[Serial port]]\n* [[Parallel port]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* Shared [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] input device port\n* [[VHS]] or [[8 mm video format|8mm]] VCR\n* [[IrDA]]\n* [[S-video]] port{{NoteTag|Unconfirmed if this exists in most recent models of laptops.}}\n* [[PC Card]] / [[PCMCIA]] slot\n* [[ExpressCard]] slot\n* [[CD Drive|CD/DVD Drives]] (starting with 2013 models)\n* [[VGA port]] (starting with 2013 models)\n\n==Comparison with desktops==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File:Astrid Gruppefremvisning.jpg|thumb|A teacher using laptop as part of a workshop for school children]]\n[[File:Jimmy Wales accessing Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] using a laptop on a park bench]]\n\n'''Portability''' is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop PCs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Should I buy a laptop or desktop? | publisher = IT Division&nbsp;\u2013 University of Wisconsin | date = 19 March 2008 | url = http://kb.wisc.edu/showroom/page.php?id=3044 | accessdate =27 November 2008 }}</ref> Physical portability allows a laptop to be used in many places\u2014not only at home and at the office, but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients' locations or at a meeting room, etc. Within a home, portability enables laptop users to move their device from the living room to the dining room to the family room. Portability offers several distinct advantages:\n* '''Productivity''': Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used can help employees and students to increase their productivity on work or school tasks. For example, an office worker reading their work e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, or a student doing their homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures.\n* '''Immediacy''': Carrying a laptop means having instant access to information, including personal and work files. This allows better collaboration between coworkers or students, as a laptop can be flipped open to look at a report, document, spreadsheet, or presentation anytime and anywhere.\n* '''Up-to-date information''': If a person has more than one desktop PC, a problem of synchronization arises: changes made on one computer are not automatically propagated to the others. There are ways to resolve this problem, including physical transfer of updated files (using a USB flash memory stick or CD-ROMs) or using synchronization software over the Internet, such as [[cloud computing]]. However, transporting a single laptop to both locations avoids the problem entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.\n* '''Connectivity''': In the 2010s, a proliferation of [[Wi-Fi]] wireless networks and cellular broadband data services ([[HSDPA]], [[EVDO]] and others) in many urban centers, combined with near-ubiquitous Wi-Fi support by modern laptops{{NoteTag|Almost all laptops contain a Wi-Fi interface; broadband cellular devices are available widely as extension cards and USB devices, and also as internal cards in select models.}} meant that a laptop could now have easy [[Internet]] and local network connectivity while remaining mobile. Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Faster Wi-Fi Predicted for Colleges | newspaper = The Chronicle of Higher Education | author = Josh Fischman | date = 7 August 2008| url = http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3226/faster-wifi-predicted-for-colleges | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of laptops:\n* '''Size''': Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away in a desk drawer.\n* '''Low power consumption''': Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20\u2013120 W, compared to 100\u2013800 W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for large businesses, which run hundreds of personal computers thus multiplying the potential savings, and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.).\n* '''Quiet''': Laptops are typically much quieter than desktops, due both to the components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.\n* '''Battery''': a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts. A desktop PC needs an [[Uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) to handle short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving on-battery time of more than 20\u201330 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS.<ref>A sample line of UPS devices and on-battery power: {{cite web | title = Back-UPS RS | publisher = APC | url = http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=23 | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* '''All-in-One''': designed to be portable, most 2010-era laptops have all components integrated into the chassis (however, some small laptops may not have an internal CD/CDR/DVD drive, so an external drive needs to be used). For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is divided into the desktop \"tower\" (the unit with the CPU, hard drive, power supply, etc.), keyboard, mouse, display screen, and optional peripherals such as speakers.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCompared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:\n\n====Performance====\nWhile the performance of mainstream desktops and laptop is comparable, and the cost of laptops has fallen less rapidly than desktops, laptops remain more expensive than desktop PCs at the same performance level.<ref>In a comparison between laptop and desktop of equal cost, the desktop's System Benchmark Score was twice that of the laptop. {{cite web | title = What to Buy, a Notebook or Desktop PC? | publisher = Tom's Hardware | date = 11 June 2008 | url = http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/desktop-vs-notebook,1946-7.html | accessdate =28 November 2008}}</ref> The upper limits of performance of laptops remain much lower than the highest-end desktops (especially \"workstation class\" machines with two processor sockets), and \"bleeding-edge\" features usually appear first in desktops and only then, as the underlying technology matures, are adapted to laptops.\n\nFor Internet browsing and typical office applications, where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input, even relatively low-end laptops (such as Netbooks) can be fast enough for some users.<ref>For example, a review of the [[MSI Wind Netbook]] says that \"''The device is rarely sluggish in general use.

However, laptop processors can be disadvantaged when dealing with a higher-end database, maths, engineering, financial software, virtualization, etc. This is because laptops use the mobile versions of processors to conserve power, and these lag behind desktop chips when it comes to performance. Some manufacturers work around this performance problem by using desktop CPUs for laptops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/07/14/rock-delivers-bd-core-i7-equipped-xtreme-790-and-xtreme-840-ga/|title=Rock delivers BD / Core i7-equipped Xtreme 790 and Xtreme 840 gaming laptops|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n====Upgradeability====\nUpgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops, which are thoroughly standardized. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Optical drives and [[internal expansion card]]s may be upgraded if they follow an [[Technical standard|industry standard]], but all other internal components, including the motherboard, CPU and graphics, are not always intended to be upgradeable. [[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]] and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards. The reasons for limited upgradeability are both technical and economic. There is no industry-wide standard [[Computer form factor|form factor]] for laptops; each major laptop manufacturer pursues its own [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] design and construction, with the result that laptops are difficult to upgrade and have high repair costs. Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SDD, RAM, Keyboard...) in order to reduce size and upgradeability prospects. Devices such as sound cards, network adapters, hard and optical drives, and numerous other peripherals are available, but these upgrades usually impair the laptop's portability, because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is on the move.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ergonomics and health effects====\n\n=====Wrists=====\n[[Image:laptop-coaster.jpg|thumb|[[Laptop cooler]] (silver) under laptop (white), preventing heating of lap and improving laptop airflow]]\n\nProlonged use of laptops can cause [[repetitive strain injury]] because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices,.<ref>{{cite web| last = Toub| first = Allegra| title = Take It Easy on Those Keyboards| publisher = Backlight Resumes| date = 23 May 2017| url = http://blog.backlightresumes.com/take-it-easy-on-those-keyboards| accessdate = 23 May 2017}}</ref> Usage of separate, external [[ergonomic keyboard]]s and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station.

Components such as screen hinges, latches, [[DC connector|power jack]]s, and [[power cord]]s deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and may have to be replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer, result in a costly repair or entire replacement of laptops. One study found that a laptop is three times more likely to break during the first year of use than a desktop.<ref>{{cite web| title = Gartner: Notebook PCs still prone to hardware failure| date = 27 June 2006| publisher = IDG News Service / ITWorld| url = http://www.itworld.com/060627notebookpc| accessdate =27 November 2008}}</ref> To maintain a laptop, it is recommended to clean it every three months for dirt, debris, dust, and food particles. Most cleaning kits consist of a lint-free or [[microfiber]] cloth for the LCD screen and keyboard, compressed air for getting dust out of the cooling fan, and cleaning solution. Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geier|first=Eric|title=Zen and the Art of Laptop Maintenance|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260438/zen_and_the_art_of_laptop_maintenance.html|work=PC World|accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===== Parts replacement =====\nOriginal external components are expensive and usually proprietary and non-interchangeable; other parts are inexpensive\u2014a power jack can cost a few dollars\u2014but their replacement may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician. Other inexpensive but fragile parts often cannot be purchased separately from larger more expensive components. For example, the video display cable and the backlight power cable that pass through the lid hinges to connect the motherboard to the screen may eventually break from repeated opening and closing of the lid. These tiny cables usually cannot be purchased from the original manufacturer separate from the entire LCD panel, with the price of hundreds of dollars, although for popular models an aftermarket in pulled parts generally exists. The repair costs of a failed motherboard or LCD panel often exceeds the value of a used laptop. Parts can also be ordered from third party vendors.\n\n=====Heating and cooling=====\nLaptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a [[computer fan|fan]] and [[heat sink]] that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. A complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).\n\n===== Battery life =====\nBattery life is limited because the capacity drops with time, eventually requiring replacement after as little as a year. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours, depending on usage, configuration, and power management settings. Yet, as it ages, the battery's energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and discharging time. Some laptops (specifically ultrabooks) do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have its battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive.\n\n====Security and privacy====\n{{Main|Laptop theft}}\nBecause they are valuable, commonly used, portable, and easy to hide in a backpack or other type of travel bag, laptops are often [[laptop theft|stolen]]. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/services/dell_lost_laptop_study.pdf], Ponemon Institute, Airport Insecurity: The Case of Lost Laptops, June 2008</ref> The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems ([[identity theft]], [[credit card fraud]], breach of privacy), can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself. Consequently, physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance. Most laptops have a [[Kensington security slot]], which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock. In addition, modern operating systems and [[disk encryption software|third-party software]] offer [[disk encryption]] functionality, which renders the data on the laptop's [[hard drive]] unreadable without a [[key (cryptography)|key]] or a passphrase. As of 2015, some laptops also have additional security elements added, including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.laptop-security-pro.com/biometric-devices.html|title= Secure File Sharing|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website= Biometric Devices and Laptop Security|publisher= Laptop Security Pro|accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSoftware such as LoJack for Laptops, Laptop Cop, and GadgetTrack have been engineered to help people locate and recover their stolen laptop in the event of theft. Setting one's laptop with a password on its firmware (protection against going to firmware setup or booting), internal HDD/SSD (protection against accessing it and loading an operating system on it afterwards), and every user account of the operating system are additional security measures that a user should do.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186235/how-to-secure-your-computer-with-a-bios-or-uefi-password/|title=How to Secure Your Computer With a BIOS or UEFI Password|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186881/hard-disk-passwords-explained-should-you-set-one-to-secure-your-files/|title=Hard Disk Passwords Explained: Should You Set One to Secure Your Files?|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref> Fewer than 5% of lost or stolen laptops are recovered by the companies that own them,<ref>[http://www.intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html#.UP2bUFSzBJN#ixzz2Ucm2oKSg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606040557/http://intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html|date=6 June 2013}}, Ponemon Institute, The Billion Dollar Lost Laptop Problem, September 2010</ref> however, that number may decrease due to a variety of companies and software solutions specializing in laptop recovery.

Although these toxins are relatively harmless when the laptop is in use, concerns that discarded laptops cause a serious health risk and toxic environment damage, were so strong, that the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in Europe specified that all laptop computers must be recycled by law. Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ([[Epargyreus clarus|EPA]]) has outlawed [[landfill]] dumping or the incinerating of discarded laptop computers.\n\nMost laptop computers begin the recycling process with a method known as Demanufacturing ([[Demanufacture]]), this involves the physical separation of the components of the laptop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/where_to_recycle/business_laptops/what_to_do_with_used_office_laptops.html|title=Laptop Disposal Ewaste Recycling and IT asset disposition (ITAD)|last=Recycling|first=Newtech|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  These components are then either grouped into materials (e.g. plastic, metal and glass) for recycling or more complex items that require more advanced materials separation (e.g.) circuit boards, hard drives and batteries.\n\nCorporate laptop recycling can require an additional process known as data destruction.

Few languages ever become sufficiently popular that they are used by more than a few people, but professional [[programmer]]s may use dozens of languages in a career.\n\nMost programming languages are not standardized by an international (or national) standard, even widely used ones, such as [[Perl]] or [[Standard ML]] (despite the name). Notable standardized programming languages include [[ALGOL]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], JavaScript (under the name [[ECMAScript]]), [[Smalltalk]], [[Prolog]], [[Common Lisp]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] ([[IEEE]] standard), [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Fortran]], [[COBOL]], [[SQL]] and [[XQuery]].\n\n__TOC__\n{{-}}\n\n==General comparison==\nThe following table compares general and technical information for a selection of commonly used [[programming language]]s.
