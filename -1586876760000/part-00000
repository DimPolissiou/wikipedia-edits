The film stars [[Charles Bronson]] in the lead role with a supporting cast that includes [[Lisa Eilbacher]], [[Andrew Stevens]], [[Gene Davis (actor)|Gene Davis]], [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] and [[Wilford Brimley]]. ''10 to Midnight'' was released by City Films, a subsidiary of [[Cannon Films]], to American cinemas on March 11, 1983.\n\n==Plot==\nWarren Stacy ([[Gene Davis (actor)|Gene Davis]]) is a young office equipment repairman who kills women after they reject his sexual advances. His attempts at [[flirting]] are always seen as \"creepy\" by women, resulting in frequent rejections.<ref name=\"Knight\">Knight (2008), p. 49-51</ref> His first victim is Betty (June Gilbert), an office worker of his acquaintance. He tracks her down to a wooded area, and observes her having sex with her boyfriend. He ambushes the couple, kills the boyfriend and then gives chase to the naked woman. He catches her and stabs her to death.<ref name=\"Knight\">Knight (2008), p. 49-51</ref>\n\nTwo Los Angeles police detectives, Leo Kessler ([[Charles Bronson]]) and Paul McAnn ([[Andrew Stevens]]), investigate his murders. Kessler is a seasoned veteran of the force, while McAnn is considerably younger.<ref name=\"Knight\">Knight (2008), p. 49-51</ref> Stacy avoids prosecution by constructing sound alibis and assaulting his victims while naked except for a pair of latex gloves to hide [[fingerprint]]s, thus minimizing evidence.\n\nLaurie Kessler ([[Lisa Eilbacher]]) is the only daughter of Leo and an acquaintance to some of the victims. A student nurse herself, she becomes a target for the killer.<ref name=\"Knight\">Knight (2008), p. 49-51</ref> McAnn refuses to go along when Kessler plants evidence in order to frame the suspect. Stacy goes on another rampage, killing three nursing students who are friends with Kessler's daughter.\n\nHe is eventually caught, stark naked in the street. Stacy boasts how he will say all the things that will \"prove\" that he is crazy: he hears voices ordering him to do things, etc., so that one day, he will be back on the street and Kessler, as well as the \"whole fucking world,\" will hear from him again. Kessler replies, \"No, we won't.\" He then shoots Stacy once in the forehead, executing him and leaving all other considerations aside. Kessler stands over the body, surrounded by police.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charles Bronson]] as Leo Kessler, a tough LAPD detective who pursues Stacy.\n* [[Lisa Eilbacher]] as Laurie Kessler, Leo's daughter.\n* [[Andrew Stevens]] as Paul McAnn, Leo's partner and best friend.\n* [[Gene Davis (actor)|Gene Davis]] as Warren Stacy, a young psychopathic serial killer and office equipment repairman that rapes and murders young women after they reject him.\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Dave Dante\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as Capt.

The intent was to portray the characters in a way that the audience will feel no sympathy for him. The type of [[villain]] an audience wants to see go down.<ref name=\"Knight\">Knight (2008), p. 49-51</ref>\n\nThe film features both strong violence, and much \"gratuitous nudity\". It combines the two by having victims killed while naked or partially undressed.<ref name=\"Knight\">Knight (2008), p. 49-51</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProducer Pancho Kohner had made a number of movies with Charles Bronson and J. Lee Thompson. They purchased the film rights to the novel ''[[The Evil That Men Do (film)|The Evil That Men Do]]'' (1978) by [[R. Lance Hill]]. Cannon Films chairman [[Menahem Golan]] wanted to market Bronson's next film project and the adaptation of the novel was going to be that project. But Kohner estimated the rights to the novel and the cost of the screenplay to be worth $200,000 dollars. Menahem refused to pay and the deal fell through.<ref name=\"Talbot\">Talbot (2006), p. 76-77</ref> \n\nHowever, Menahem still offered to market Bronson's next film project, just not based on that novel. He and Kohner had already arranged a visit to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] to promote ''The Evil That Men Do''. He asked Kohner to come up with a new project and fresh title, and ''10 to Midnight'' was the result of his brainstorm. At the Festival they promoted the project to potential buyers, as a film featuring action, danger, and revenge. But at this point, they really had no script for the suggested film. Back in Los Angeles, they went in search of a story of the film. A colleague of Kohner's, Lance Hool, suggested using the screenplay ''Bloody Sunday'' by William Roberts. They simply attached the already chosen title to that screenplay.<ref name=\"Talbot\">Talbot (2006), p. 76-77</ref> (''The Evil That Men Do'' later ended up being financed by ITC Entertainment.)\n\nThe name of killer Warren for Warren Stacy was based on Hollywood star [[Warren Beatty]].\n\nActor [[Eugene M. Davis|Gene Davis]], who played Warren, said that director J. Lee Thompson pretty much left him alone to form his character, but told him \"We don't want the role to be sympathetic...\" presumably so as to make the ending have more impact.<ref>{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Talbot | authorlink=Paul Talbot | title=Bronson's Loose Again!

Ragland]] and the film was recorded by [[cinematographer]] Adam Greenberg. The film also features actor Robert F. Lyons and actress [[Kelly Preston]] (listed as Kelly Palzis) in smaller roles.\n\n==Reception==\nHeavy on violence, nudity, vulgar language and sexual situations, ''10 to Midnight'' drew scathing reviews from film critics, including a \"zero stars\" rating from [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' who wrote, \"I admired [Bronson's] strong, simple talent once.

The film has maintained a sizeable [[cult following]] through home video releases and cable TV showings.
