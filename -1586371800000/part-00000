Players can create, customize and control their own character. The game is set in a [[Recycling bin|bin]]-like setting where many locations have been specifically designed for this theme (e.g. Kip's Scrapyard, Peel's Park, Ink's Orange Peel) with items you would find usually in a bin, such as mould and orange peels. Players have their own \"[[nest]]\" in which they can adjust the colour and design the rooms. Players can choose to upgrade the nest to all 8 rooms using the Mulch currency via a membership and can also choose to decorate their rooms by buying items from the \"Shopping Mall\" and placing the items in their rooms accordingly. The items can also be sold at one of the locations in the game if the player doesn't want the item anymore for Mulch currency. The nest consists of a private cinema, a plaza (both require membership), a garden, and a nest generator. Depending on how low the nest generator level is, the brighter or darker the nest gets. All players also have a \"Bin Card\" in their nest, which they can stamp every day to collect rewards including hat coupons, plants, XP and much more.\n\n== Extra Information ==\nBin Weevils are 10 feet in height and can be found underground. This is pretty cool\n\n\nThe main navigation of the game is the Map which players can use to travel to different areas of the game. The map has had many changes in the past due to re-designs. The newest version of the map was designed by Tom Bland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tombland.net/animation/bin-weevils/|title=Tom Bland \u00b7 Portfolio|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101032439/http://tombland.net/animation/bin-weevils/|archive-date=1 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>  There are several multiplayer games which players can play to earn currency (\"Mulch\") and experience points (\"XP\").  There are also a number of educational games, such as the \"Daily Brain Strain,\" which players can visit every day to test their knowledge through a series of math, geography and puzzle questions.  Players who participate in the 60 seconds can receive Mulch and XP based on how well they have done. Players can also enter codes to receive rewards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bin-weevils-fun-free-browserbased-kids-game-plenty/|title=Bin Weevils \u2013 A Fun Free Browser-Based Game For Kids With Plenty To Do|website=MakeUseOf|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021080044/https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bin-weevils-fun-free-browserbased-kids-game-plenty/|archive-date=21 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAll users have a garden outside of their nest, in which they can buy plants from the 'Garden Shop' and plant and then harvest for in-game currency (\"Mulch\") and experience points (\"XP\"). The user can save the currency or buy more plants and the XP contributes to levelling up towards the next level. There are 80 levels in total but more are often added. In addition, paying players can purchase a virtual pet called a \"Bin Pet.\"  The Bin Pet has its own profile and a bed. Players can feed their Bin Pet and make the pet character perform tricks and play mini-games. Non-paying players can also own a virtual pet for 24 hours. This feature is called \"Pet-For-A-Day\" and was first revealed on January 17, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://binweevilcompany.wordpress.com/bin-weevils/bin-pets-2/|title=Bin Pets|date=2014-03-24|website=Bin Weevil Company|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\nMany of the old locations, including Tum's Diner, were designed by Michael Jary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaeljary.com/bin-weevils.html|title=Bin Weevils|website=www.michaeljary.com|access-date=2019-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024134901/http://www.michaeljary.com/bin-weevils.html|archive-date=24 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Membership ===\nBin Tycoon is an enhancement on Bin Weevils. Many who subscribe to a premium membership receive a monthly Dosh wage that gradually increases, depending on how many months a player has a premium membership. With this salary, the player can purchase hats for their character, items and clothing for their virtual pet, write magazines and much more to do.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gazettereview.com/2016/02/top-bin-weevils-paid-membership-perks/|title=The Top Bin Weevils Paid Membership Perks|last=Jacobs|first=Ashley|date=2016-02-06|website=Gazette Review|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202954/https://gazettereview.com/2016/02/top-bin-weevils-paid-membership-perks/|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The currency \"Dosh\" was introduced in 2012 and replaced high Mulch prices in many areas, although it requires real currency payment. However, from time to time, players can take part in challenges, watch advertisements, or enter codes to earn a currency. It was possible to become a paying member for 1 month with an [[SMS|SMS text]] in the early stages of the game, but was discontinued in 2013. Players were still eligible to buy Mulch from the subscription section before 2013, the highest amount being \u00a314.99 for 75,000 Mulch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.binweevils.com/membership2/payment/membership/package/4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212173233/http://www.binweevils.com/membership2/payment/membership/package/4|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-02-12|title=Bin Weevils|date=2012-02-12|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref> Players can still acquire the currency in the game, although it is the main currency for a lot of activities. Players can play multiplayer games to win currency or submit codes, etc. Dosh is currently the only currency to buy on the membership page. Bin Weevils revealed in 2015 that 90% of the content on the site was free to play and 90% of their audience was non-paying members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/55-pixels-ltd-a15-305045.html|title=55 Pixels Ltd|last=Practice|first=Advertising Standards Authority {{!}} Committee of Advertising|website=asa.org.uk|access-date=2019-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820062157/https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/55-pixels-ltd-a15-305045.html|archive-date=20 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Safety and communication ===\nBin Weevils represents the kidSAFE badge on their website,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kidsafeseal.com/certifiedproducts/binweevils.html|title=Binweevils.com is certified by the kidSAFE Seal Program|website=kidsafeseal.com|access-date=2019-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817153733/https://www.kidsafeseal.com/certifiedproducts/binweevils.html|archive-date=17 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> as well as this they claim that players chat and buddy messages are moderated 24/7 so that there is no exchange of personal information or inappropriate language. The moderation system is based on a ticket method, according to the Bin Weevils support page. When a player uses an offensive term, live moderators are notified and a punishment can be imposed on a player's account that can range from one day to a permanent suspension.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support55pixels.helpshift.com/a/bin-weevils/?s=parents-safety&f=safety-concerns&l=en|title=Bin Weevils: Safety Concerns|website=55 Pixels Support|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref> As well as this, the game also has a reporting interface where players can submit reports on another player manually through the player's profile. The report functionality contains the reasons that the player decides to report, or a field where the player can explain what the other player has done. The safety feature creates a secure environment that promotes peace of mind for parents and allows children to communicate, meet new friends and improve their online social skills. Although the messaging filter system is in effect, although not perfect, players still found ways to exchange information with other players by combining sentences and letters together.\n\n== Other ==\n\n=== Merchandise ===\nBin Weevils signed a licensing agreement to launch a game-based merchandise range with the toy manufacturer Character Options.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/32453/character-group-wins-bin-weevils-master-toy-licence-38642.html|title=Character Group wins Bin Weevils master toy licence|date=2012-02-06|website=Proactiveinvestors UK|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> The merchandise consisted of a [[Collectible card game|trading card game]] that was launched in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.licenseglobal.com/bin-weevils-products-released-uk|title=Bin Weevils Products Released in U.K.|date=2011-11-03|website=License Global|language=en|access-date=2019-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021080043/https://www.licenseglobal.com/bin-weevils-products-released-uk|archive-date=21 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> a clothing set, backpacks, figurines and toys which launched in October 2012 and books.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.licensing.biz/2013/04/17/binweevils-eyes-further-growth-after-toy-success/|title=BinWeevils eyes further growth after toy success|website=Licensing.biz|language=en-GB|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826105818/https://www.licensing.biz/2013/04/17/binweevils-eyes-further-growth-after-toy-success/|archive-date=26 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> An album titled \"Bin Weevils\" with Sony in December 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/02/21/binweevils-gets-musical-with-first-album-release/|title=BinWeevils gets musical with first album release|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826105822/http://kidscreen.com/2013/02/21/binweevils-gets-musical-with-first-album-release/|archive-date=26 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/cd-bin-weevils-bin-tunes|title=CD: Bin Weevils - Bin Tunes {{!}} The Arts Desk|website=theartsdesk.com|access-date=2019-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202642/https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/cd-bin-weevils-bin-tunes|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A competition was held relating to the album which four children could be picked to write a song for the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rainbowawards.co.uk/2013/05/bin-weevils-launches-bin-tunes-competition/|title=Bin Weevils launches Bin Tunes competition|date=2013-05-21|website=Rainbow Toy Awards - The Awards for the UK Toy Industry|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824142231/https://www.rainbowawards.co.uk/2013/05/bin-weevils-launches-bin-tunes-competition/|archive-date=24 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animate-it.com/studio-news/behind-the-scenes-with-our-bin-weevils-prize-winners/|title=Behind the Scenes with our Bin Weevils Prize Winners! {{!}} Animate it|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020224358/https://animate-it.com/studio-news/behind-the-scenes-with-our-bin-weevils-prize-winners/|archive-date=20 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The album was launched on 29 July 2013 with a tracklist of 12 children's songs.

The software had several functions, including the possibility of customising the created character in the game, playing multiplayer games with friends at quick access, and sending friend messages. In addition, the application included several bugs and player expectations were not met. Fewer players tended to utilise the application over time and was removed from the [[Google Play|Google Play store]] and the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App store]].\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2015, both Bin Weevils and [[Moshi Monsters]] were requested by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standard Authority]] (ASA) to change the wording of their in-app advertising, stating that players were under pressure to purchase items in the game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34062376|title=Ad watchdog rebukes Moshi Monsters|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|date=2015-08-26|access-date=2019-07-06|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706054700/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34062376|archive-date=6 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/26/moshi-monsters-bin-weevils-in-app-purchase-ads-breach-standards|title=Moshi Monsters and Bin Weevils rapped for promoting subscriptions to children|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|date=2015-08-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202954/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/26/moshi-monsters-bin-weevils-in-app-purchase-ads-breach-standards|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  55 Pixels Ltd, the company which operates the game, said that \"as soon as [we] were made aware of the complaint made to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] about a potential breach, and once we had understood the area for concern, we changed all our membership pages to comply with their recommendations. [The ASA] subsequently upheld the complaint about the original wording but referenced that we now complied, in the text of the ruling.\"\n\n55 Pixels Ltd was also criticised by many players and parents, many of whom criticised the lack of a \"bin-like environment\" in the game and the \"bad influence\" on children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/1/post/2016/09/is-bin-weevils-a-bad-influence-for-children.html|title=Is Bin Weevils a bad influence for children?|website=Binweevils Rant Central|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/|title=Bin Weevils Rant Central|date=2015-11-05|access-date=2019-07-12|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712081501/http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/|archive-date=12 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBin Weevils was also strongly criticised for lack of game security, as exploiters wrote offensive language in places using third party tools, where other players were also able to see offensive language. The game magazine's functionality was exploited in 2016, and several other players also blamed Bin Weevils for lack of security. Bin Weevils had to remove some of the game's features, such as public [[Ladder tournament|leaderboards]], to make the feature friends-only because of the exploiters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://binbloggers.weebly.com/2/post/2016/12/bin-weevils-safety-compromised.html|title=Bin Weevils {{!}} Safety Compromised?|website=Bin Bloggers|language=en|access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref> Due to the 2016 exploits, a common and popular feature called \u201cPhoto Studio\u201d was removed.

Players can create, customize and control their own character. The game is set in a [[Recycling bin|bin]]-like setting where many locations have been specifically designed for this theme (e.g. Kip's Scrapyard, Peel's Park, Ink's Orange Peel) with items you would find usually in a bin, such as mould and orange peels. Players have their own \"[[nest]]\" in which they can adjust the colour and design the rooms. Players can choose to upgrade the nest to all 8 rooms using the Mulch currency via a membership and can also choose to decorate their rooms by buying items from the \"Shopping Mall\" and placing the items in their rooms accordingly. The items can also be sold at one of the locations in the game if the player doesn't want the item anymore for Mulch currency. The nest consists of a private cinema, a plaza (both require membership), a garden, and a nest generator. Depending on how low the nest generator level is, the brighter or darker the nest gets. All players also have a \"Bin Card\" in their nest, which they can stamp every day to collect rewards including hat coupons, plants, XP and much more.\n\nThe main navigation of the game is the Map which players can use to travel to different areas of the game. The map has had many changes in the past due to re-designs. The newest version of the map was designed by Tom Bland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tombland.net/animation/bin-weevils/|title=Tom Bland \u00b7 Portfolio|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101032439/http://tombland.net/animation/bin-weevils/|archive-date=1 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>  There are several multiplayer games which players can play to earn currency (\"Mulch\") and experience points (\"XP\").  There are also a number of educational games, such as the \"Daily Brain Strain,\" which players can visit every day to test their knowledge through a series of math, geography and puzzle questions.  Players who participate in the 60 seconds can receive Mulch and XP based on how well they have done. Players can also enter codes to receive rewards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bin-weevils-fun-free-browserbased-kids-game-plenty/|title=Bin Weevils \u2013 A Fun Free Browser-Based Game For Kids With Plenty To Do|website=MakeUseOf|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021080044/https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bin-weevils-fun-free-browserbased-kids-game-plenty/|archive-date=21 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAll users have a garden outside of their nest, in which they can buy plants from the 'Garden Shop' and plant and then harvest for in-game currency (\"Mulch\") and experience points (\"XP\"). The user can save the currency or buy more plants and the XP contributes to levelling up towards the next level. There are 80 levels in total but more are often added. In addition, paying players can purchase a virtual pet called a \"Bin Pet.\"  The Bin Pet has its own profile and a bed. Players can feed their Bin Pet and make the pet character perform tricks and play mini-games. Non-paying players can also own a virtual pet for 24 hours. This feature is called \"Pet-For-A-Day\" and was first revealed on January 17, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://binweevilcompany.wordpress.com/bin-weevils/bin-pets-2/|title=Bin Pets|date=2014-03-24|website=Bin Weevil Company|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\nMany of the old locations, including Tum's Diner, were designed by Michael Jary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaeljary.com/bin-weevils.html|title=Bin Weevils|website=www.michaeljary.com|access-date=2019-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024134901/http://www.michaeljary.com/bin-weevils.html|archive-date=24 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Membership ===\nBin Tycoon is an enhancement on Bin Weevils. Many who subscribe to a premium membership receive a monthly Dosh wage that gradually increases, depending on how many months a player has a premium membership. With this salary, the player can purchase hats for their character, items and clothing for their virtual pet, write magazines and much more to do.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gazettereview.com/2016/02/top-bin-weevils-paid-membership-perks/|title=The Top Bin Weevils Paid Membership Perks|last=Jacobs|first=Ashley|date=2016-02-06|website=Gazette Review|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202954/https://gazettereview.com/2016/02/top-bin-weevils-paid-membership-perks/|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The currency \"Dosh\" was introduced in 2012 and replaced high Mulch prices in many areas, although it requires real currency payment.

When a player uses an offensive term, live moderators are notified and a punishment can be imposed on a player's account that can range from one day to a permanent suspension.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support55pixels.helpshift.com/a/bin-weevils/?s=parents-safety&f=safety-concerns&l=en|title=Bin Weevils: Safety Concerns|website=55 Pixels Support|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref> As well as this, the game also has a reporting interface where players can submit reports on another player manually through the player's profile. The report functionality contains the reasons that the player decides to report, or a field where the player can explain what the other player has done. The safety feature creates a secure environment that promotes peace of mind for parents and allows children to communicate, meet new friends and improve their online social skills. Although the messaging filter system is in effect, although not perfect, players still found ways to exchange information with other players by combining sentences and letters together.\n\n== Other ==\n\n=== Merchandise ===\nBin Weevils signed a licensing agreement to launch a game-based merchandise range with the toy manufacturer Character Options.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/32453/character-group-wins-bin-weevils-master-toy-licence-38642.html|title=Character Group wins Bin Weevils master toy licence|date=2012-02-06|website=Proactiveinvestors UK|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> The merchandise consisted of a [[Collectible card game|trading card game]] that was launched in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.licenseglobal.com/bin-weevils-products-released-uk|title=Bin Weevils Products Released in U.K.|date=2011-11-03|website=License Global|language=en|access-date=2019-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021080043/https://www.licenseglobal.com/bin-weevils-products-released-uk|archive-date=21 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> a clothing set, backpacks, figurines and toys which launched in October 2012 and books.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.licensing.biz/2013/04/17/binweevils-eyes-further-growth-after-toy-success/|title=BinWeevils eyes further growth after toy success|website=Licensing.biz|language=en-GB|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826105818/https://www.licensing.biz/2013/04/17/binweevils-eyes-further-growth-after-toy-success/|archive-date=26 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> An album titled \"Bin Weevils\" with Sony in December 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/02/21/binweevils-gets-musical-with-first-album-release/|title=BinWeevils gets musical with first album release|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826105822/http://kidscreen.com/2013/02/21/binweevils-gets-musical-with-first-album-release/|archive-date=26 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/cd-bin-weevils-bin-tunes|title=CD: Bin Weevils - Bin Tunes {{!}} The Arts Desk|website=theartsdesk.com|access-date=2019-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202642/https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/cd-bin-weevils-bin-tunes|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A competition was held relating to the album which four children could be picked to write a song for the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rainbowawards.co.uk/2013/05/bin-weevils-launches-bin-tunes-competition/|title=Bin Weevils launches Bin Tunes competition|date=2013-05-21|website=Rainbow Toy Awards - The Awards for the UK Toy Industry|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824142231/https://www.rainbowawards.co.uk/2013/05/bin-weevils-launches-bin-tunes-competition/|archive-date=24 August 2019|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animate-it.com/studio-news/behind-the-scenes-with-our-bin-weevils-prize-winners/|title=Behind the Scenes with our Bin Weevils Prize Winners! {{!}} Animate it|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020224358/https://animate-it.com/studio-news/behind-the-scenes-with-our-bin-weevils-prize-winners/|archive-date=20 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The album was launched on 29 July 2013 with a tracklist of 12 children's songs.

On November 6, 2016, 55 Pixels Ltd released the mobile application a few months after the reveal. The software had several functions, including the possibility of customising the created character in the game, playing multiplayer games with friends at quick access, and sending friend messages. In addition, the application included several bugs and player expectations were not met. Fewer players tended to utilise the application over time and was removed from the [[Google Play|Google Play store]] and the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App store]].\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2015, both Bin Weevils and [[Moshi Monsters]] were requested by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standard Authority]] (ASA) to change the wording of their in-app advertising, stating that players were under pressure to purchase items in the game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34062376|title=Ad watchdog rebukes Moshi Monsters|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|date=2015-08-26|access-date=2019-07-06|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706054700/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34062376|archive-date=6 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/26/moshi-monsters-bin-weevils-in-app-purchase-ads-breach-standards|title=Moshi Monsters and Bin Weevils rapped for promoting subscriptions to children|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|date=2015-08-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014202954/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/26/moshi-monsters-bin-weevils-in-app-purchase-ads-breach-standards|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  55 Pixels Ltd, the company which operates the game, said that \"as soon as [we] were made aware of the complaint made to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] about a potential breach, and once we had understood the area for concern, we changed all our membership pages to comply with their recommendations. [The ASA] subsequently upheld the complaint about the original wording but referenced that we now complied, in the text of the ruling.\"\n\n55 Pixels Ltd was also criticised by many players and parents, many of whom criticised the lack of a \"bin-like environment\" in the game and the \"bad influence\" on children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/1/post/2016/09/is-bin-weevils-a-bad-influence-for-children.html|title=Is Bin Weevils a bad influence for children?|website=Binweevils Rant Central|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/|title=Bin Weevils Rant Central|date=2015-11-05|access-date=2019-07-12|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712081501/http://binweevilsrantcentral.weebly.com/|archive-date=12 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBin Weevils was also strongly criticised for lack of game security, as exploiters wrote offensive language in places using third party tools, where other players were also able to see offensive language. The game magazine's functionality was exploited in 2016, and several other players also blamed Bin Weevils for lack of security. Bin Weevils had to remove some of the game's features, such as public [[Ladder tournament|leaderboards]], to make the feature friends-only because of the exploiters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://binbloggers.weebly.com/2/post/2016/12/bin-weevils-safety-compromised.html|title=Bin Weevils {{!}} Safety Compromised?|website=Bin Bloggers|language=en|access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref> Due to the 2016 exploits, a common and popular feature called \u201cPhoto Studio\u201d was removed.

Teller met [[Penn Jillette]] in 1974, and they became a three-person act with Chrisemer called Asparagus Valley Cultural Society, which started at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival and subsequently played in San Francisco. In 1981, they began performing exclusively together as Penn & Teller, an act that continues to this day. On April 5, 2013, Penn and Teller were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live performance category. Their star, the 2,494th awarded, is near the star dedicated to [[Harry Houdini]].<ref name=\"WalkofFame\">{{cite web | url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/04/05/magicians-penn-teller-set-for-walk-of-fame-star/ | title=Magicians Penn & Teller Get Star on Walk of Fame | publisher=CBS Los Angeles | date=April 5, 2013 | accessdate=April 7, 2013}}</ref> The following day they were recognized by the [[Magic Castle]] with the Magicians of the Year award.<ref name=WalkofFame />\n\n====Voice====\nTeller almost never speaks while performing.

Teller also spoke in his 1987 guest appearance in \"Like a Hurricane,\" a fourth-season episode on NBC's ''[[Miami Vice]]''{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} and had speaking parts in the movies ''[[Penn & Teller Get Killed]]'' (he speaks in the final scene), ''[[Long Gone (film)|Long Gone]]'' and ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]''. He gave voice to an animated version of himself in two episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (\"[[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]\" and \"[[The Great Simpsina]]\"), and voiced a series of cloned store clerks in \"Zoey's Zoo,\" an episode of ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'', as well as the English version of the 1988 animated feature ''Light Years'' (original French title: ''Gandahar''), where he was the voice of Octum. Teller speaks at length about magic performance and sleight-of-hand in the documentary ''[[Penn & Teller's Magic and Mystery Tour]]''. Teller has been shown screaming and swearing in the \"Anger Management\" episode of ''Penn & Teller: Bullshit!''. Teller has a brief speaking part in ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part II]]'', where he advises Dagny Taggart (played by [[Samantha Mathis]]) to go out the side door of the Taggart Transcontinental offices.\n\nTeller did break his silence in his portrayal of Mortimer in the [[The Fantasticks (film)|1995 film version]] of ''[[The Fantasticks (film)|The Fantasticks]]'', though almost all of his dialogue was edited out of the film's final version (his \"Dying isn't easy\" scene is included among deleted scenes on the DVD release). He appeared as a \"cat\" in the ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'' season 1 episode \"The Cat's out of the Bag\". He also appeared in an episode of ''[[Tosh.0]]'' giving \"advice\" to a fellow magician. He stood staring at the gentleman for several seconds before uttering \"Practice once in a fuckin' while\" while walking away. Teller spoke at length during an interview on the ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' television program on January 27, 2014. During their performance in the series premiere of ''[[Penn & Teller: Fool Us]]'', Penn is rambling on and Teller yells out his name, Teller can then be heard telling Penn to \"shut up\". Also, during their performance on the season 1 finale, he tells Penn that he is okay after breathing helium and while he is in a trash bag. In another episode, he says \"Fuck, no!\"\n\nTeller's voice can be heard on season 13 of ''[[Celebrity Apprentice]]'', \"Episode 10: The Mayor of Stress Town\", when speaking with contestant Penn Jillette over Penn's mobile device. He also spoke about ''[[Tim's Vermeer]]'', the feature documentary he directed, on [[KCRW]]'s ''The Treatment''.<ref>{{cite interview| url= http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/tt/tt131211teller_tims_vermeer| title= Teller: Tim's Vermeer |work= The Treatment |publisher=KCRW | date= December 11, 2013 | interviewer=Elvis Mitchell |last= Teller| first=}}</ref>\n\nTeller plays himself, with voice, in Showtime's ''[[Dice (TV series)|Dice]]'' season 2, episode 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sho.com/dice/season/2/episode/4# |title=DICE - Season 2 Episode 4|publisher=Showtime}}</ref> He also appeared in the [[The Big Bang Theory (season 11)|season 11]] finale of CBS's ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' as Amy's father.

Once Penny shuts her down, however, Teller tells her (albeit in a whisper) \"Thank you.\" In the first and eighth episodes of [[The Big Bang Theory (season 12)|season 12]], he participates in dialogues normally.\n\n===Writing===\nTeller collaborated with Jillette on three magic books, and is also the author of ''\"When I'm Dead All This Will Be Yours!\": Joe Teller \u2013 A Portrait by His Kid'' (2000), a biography/memoir of his father. The book features his father's paintings and 100 unpublished cartoons which were strongly influenced by [[George Lichty]]'s ''[[Grin and Bear It]]''. The book was favorably reviewed by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''. Teller's father's \"wryly observed scenes of Philadelphia street life\" were created in 1939. Teller and his father's \"memories began to pump and the stories flowed\" after they opened boxes of old letters that Teller read out loud (learning for the first time about a period in his parents' lives that he knew nothing about, such as the fact that his father's name is really Israel Max Teller). Joe's Depression-era hobo adventures led to travels throughout the U.S., Canada and Alaska, and by 1933, he returned to Philadelphia for art study. After Joe and Irene met during evening art classes, they married, and Joe worked half-days as a ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' copy boy. When the ''Inquirer'' rejected his cartoons, he moved into advertising art just as World War II began. Employing excerpts from letters and postcards, Teller successfully re-creates the world of his parents in a relaxed writing style of light humor and easy (yet highly effective) transitions between the past and present.<ref name=pubweekly>\"Forecasts\", ''Publishers Weekly'', August 15, 2000.</ref>\n\nTeller is a co-author of the paper \"Attention and Awareness in Stage magic: Turning Tricks into Research\", published in ''Nature Reviews Neuroscience'' (November 2008).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Macknik, S.L. |title=Attention and Awareness in Stage Magic: Turning Tricks into Research |journal=Nat.

Teller met [[Penn Jillette]] in 1974, and they became a three-person act with Chrisemer called Asparagus Valley Cultural Society, which started at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival and subsequently played in San Francisco. In 1981, they began performing exclusively together as Penn & Teller, an act that continues to this day. On April 5, 2013, Penn and Teller were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live performance category. Their star, the 2,494th awarded, is near the star dedicated to [[Harry Houdini]].<ref name=\"WalkofFame\">{{cite web | url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/04/05/magicians-penn-teller-set-for-walk-of-fame-star/ | title=Magicians Penn & Teller Get Star on Walk of Fame | publisher=CBS Los Angeles | date=April 5, 2013 | accessdate=April 7, 2013}}</ref> The following day they were recognized by the [[Magic Castle]] with the Magicians of the Year award.<ref name=WalkofFame />\n\n====Voice====\nTeller almost never speaks while performing. There are exceptions, such as when the audience is not aware of it; for example, he provided the voice of \"Mofo the psychic gorilla\" in their early Broadway show with the help of a radio microphone cupped in his hand.

Teller also spoke in his 1987 guest appearance in \"Like a Hurricane,\" a fourth-season episode on NBC's ''[[Miami Vice]]''{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} and had speaking parts in the movies ''[[Penn & Teller Get Killed]]'' (he speaks in the final scene), ''[[Long Gone (film)|Long Gone]]'' and ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]''. He gave voice to an animated version of himself in two episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (\"[[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]\" and \"[[The Great Simpsina]]\"), and voiced a series of cloned store clerks in \"Zoey's Zoo,\" an episode of ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'', as well as the English version of the 1988 animated feature ''Light Years'' (original French title: ''Gandahar''), where he was the voice of Octum. Teller speaks at length about magic performance and sleight-of-hand in the documentary ''[[Penn & Teller's Magic and Mystery Tour]]''. Teller has been shown screaming and swearing in the \"Anger Management\" episode of ''Penn & Teller: Bullshit!''. Teller has a brief speaking part in ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part II]]'', where he advises Dagny Taggart (played by [[Samantha Mathis]]) to go out the side door of the Taggart Transcontinental offices.\n\nTeller did break his silence in his portrayal of Mortimer in the [[The Fantasticks (film)|1995 film version]] of ''[[The Fantasticks (film)|The Fantasticks]]'', though almost all of his dialogue was edited out of the film's final version (his \"Dying isn't easy\" scene is included among deleted scenes on the DVD release). He appeared as a \"cat\" in the ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'' season 1 episode \"The Cat's out of the Bag\". He also appeared in an episode of ''[[Tosh.0]]'' giving \"advice\" to a fellow magician. He stood staring at the gentleman for several seconds before uttering \"Practice once in a fuckin' while\" while walking away. Teller spoke at length during an interview on the ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' television program on January 27, 2014. During their performance in the series premiere of ''[[Penn & Teller: Fool Us]]'', Penn is rambling on and Teller yells out his name, Teller can then be heard telling Penn to \"shut up\". Also, during their performance on the season 1 finale, he tells Penn that he is okay after breathing helium and while he is in a trash bag. In another episode, he says \"Fuck, no!\"\n\nTeller's voice can be heard on season 13 of ''[[Celebrity Apprentice]]'', \"Episode 10: The Mayor of Stress Town\", when speaking with contestant Penn Jillette over Penn's mobile device. He also spoke about ''[[Tim's Vermeer]]'', the feature documentary he directed, on [[KCRW]]'s ''The Treatment''.<ref>{{cite interview| url= http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/tt/tt131211teller_tims_vermeer| title= Teller: Tim's Vermeer |work= The Treatment |publisher=KCRW | date= December 11, 2013 | interviewer=Elvis Mitchell |last= Teller| first=}}</ref>\n\nTeller plays himself, with voice, in Showtime's ''[[Dice (TV series)|Dice]]'' season 2, episode 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sho.com/dice/season/2/episode/4# |title=DICE - Season 2 Episode 4|publisher=Showtime}}</ref> He also appeared in the [[The Big Bang Theory (season 11)|season 11]] finale of CBS's ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' as Amy's father.

Once Penny shuts her down, however, Teller tells her (albeit in a whisper) \"Thank you.\" In the first and eighth episodes of [[The Big Bang Theory (season 12)|season 12]], he participates in dialogues normally.\n\n===Writing===\nTeller collaborated with Jillette on three magic books, and is also the author of ''\"When I'm Dead All This Will Be Yours!\": Joe Teller \u2013 A Portrait by His Kid'' (2000), a biography/memoir of his father. The book features his father's paintings and 100 unpublished cartoons which were strongly influenced by [[George Lichty]]'s ''[[Grin and Bear It]]''. The book was favorably reviewed by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''. Teller's father's \"wryly observed scenes of Philadelphia street life\" were created in 1939. Teller and his father's \"memories began to pump and the stories flowed\" after they opened boxes of old letters that Teller read out loud (learning for the first time about a period in his parents' lives that he knew nothing about, such as the fact that his father's name is really Israel Max Teller). Joe's Depression-era hobo adventures led to travels throughout the U.S., Canada and Alaska, and by 1933, he returned to Philadelphia for art study. After Joe and Irene met during evening art classes, they married, and Joe worked half-days as a ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' copy boy. When the ''Inquirer'' rejected his cartoons, he moved into advertising art just as World War II began. Employing excerpts from letters and postcards, Teller successfully re-creates the world of his parents in a relaxed writing style of light humor and easy (yet highly effective) transitions between the past and present.<ref name=pubweekly>\"Forecasts\", ''Publishers Weekly'', August 15, 2000.</ref>\n\nTeller is a co-author of the paper \"Attention and Awareness in Stage magic: Turning Tricks into Research\", published in ''Nature Reviews Neuroscience'' (November 2008).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Macknik, S.L. |title=Attention and Awareness in Stage Magic: Turning Tricks into Research |journal=Nat.

Nicknamed '''\"Gibby\"''' and '''\"Hoot\"''' (after actor [[Hoot Gibson]]), Gibson tallied 251 [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|wins]], 3,117 [[strikeout]]s, and a 2.91 [[earned run average]] (ERA) during his career. A nine-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and two-time [[World Series]] champion, he won two [[Cy Young Award]]s and the 1968 [[National League]] (NL) [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award]]. Known for a fiercely competitive nature and for intimidating opposing batters, he was elected in 1981 to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in his first year of eligibility. The Cardinals retired his uniform number 45 in September 1975 and inducted him into the team [[St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum|Hall of Fame]] in 2014.\n\nBorn in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], Gibson overcame childhood illness to excel in youth sports, particularly [[basketball]] and baseball. After briefly playing under contract to both the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] basketball team and the St. Louis Cardinals organization, Gibson decided to continue playing only baseball professionally. He became a full-time [[starting pitcher]] in July 1961 and earned his first All-Star appearance in 1962. Gibson won two of three games he pitched in the [[1964 World Series]], then won 20 games in a season for the first time in 1965. Gibson also pitched three [[complete game]] victories in the [[1967 World Series]]. The pinnacle of Gibson's career was 1968, when he posted a 1.12 ERA for the season and then recorded 17 strikeouts in Game 1 of the [[1968 World Series]]. \n\nGibson threw a [[no-hitter]] in 1971, but began experiencing swelling in his knee in subsequent seasons.

(MLB) for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (1959\u20131975). Nicknamed '''\"Gibby\"''' and '''\"Hoot\"''' (after actor [[Hoot Gibson]]), Gibson tallied 251 [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|wins]], 3,117 [[strikeout]]s, and a 2.91 [[earned run average]] (ERA) during his career. A nine-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and two-time [[World Series]] champion, he won two [[Cy Young Award]]s and the 1968 [[National League]] (NL) [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award]]. Known for a fiercely competitive nature and for intimidating opposing batters, he was elected in 1981 to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in his first year of eligibility. The Cardinals retired his uniform number 45 in September 1975 and inducted him into the team [[St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum|Hall of Fame]] in 2014.\n\nBorn in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], Gibson overcame childhood illness to excel in youth sports, particularly [[basketball]] and baseball. After briefly playing under contract to both the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] basketball team and the St. Louis Cardinals organization, Gibson decided to continue playing only baseball professionally. He became a full-time [[starting pitcher]] in July 1961 and earned his first All-Star appearance in 1962. Gibson won two of three games he pitched in the [[1964 World Series]], then won 20 games in a season for the first time in 1965. Gibson also pitched three [[complete game]] victories in the [[1967 World Series]]. The pinnacle of Gibson's career was 1968, when he posted a 1.12 ERA for the season and then recorded 17 strikeouts in Game 1 of the [[1968 World Series]]. \n\nGibson threw a [[no-hitter]] in 1971, but began experiencing swelling in his knee in subsequent seasons. After retiring as a player in 1975, Gibson later served as pitching coach for his former teammate [[Joe Torre]]. At one time a special instructor coach for the St.&nbsp;Louis Cardinals, Gibson was later selected for the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]] in 1999. Gibson is the author of the memoir ''Pitch by Pitch'', with Lonnie Wheeler.\n\n==Early life==\nGibson was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the last of Pack and Victoria Gibson's seven children (five boys and two girls).<ref>[[#Gib94|Gibson and Wheeler 1994]]: 11, 14</ref><ref name=\"Hal98\">[[#Hal94|Halberstam 1994]]: 98</ref> Gibson's father died of tuberculosis three months prior to Gibson's birth, and Gibson himself was named '''Pack Robert Gibson''' in his father's honor.<ref name=Hal98/><ref name=\"STTG11\">[[#Gib94|Gibson and Wheeler 1994]]: 11</ref> While he revered his father's legacy, Gibson disliked the name Pack, and later changed his first name to Robert.<ref name=STTG11/><ref name=\"retrosheetbio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/G/Pgibsb101.htm |title=Bob Gibson |website=Retrosheet.org |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> Despite a childhood that included health problems like [[rickets]], and a serious case of either [[asthma]] or [[pneumonia]] when he was three, Gibson was active in sports in both informal and organized settings, particularly [[baseball]] and [[basketball]].<ref>[[#Gib94|Gibson and Wheeler 1994]]: 12</ref> Gibson's brother Josh (no relation to [[Josh Gibson|the Negro Leagues star player]]), who was 15 years his senior, had a profound effect on his early life, serving as a mentor to him.<ref>[[#Gib94|Gibson and Wheeler 1994]]: 12\u201315</ref> Gibson played on a number of youth basketball and baseball teams his brother coached, many of which were organized through the local [[YMCA]].<ref>[[#Gib94|Gibson and Wheeler 1994]]: 15\u201319</ref>\n\nGibson attended [[Technical High School (Omaha, Nebraska)|Omaha Technical High School]], where during his tenure he participated on the track, basketball, and baseball teams.<ref>[[#Gib94|Gibson and Wheeler 1994]]: 20\u201323</ref> Health issues resurfaced for Gibson, though, and he needed a doctor's permission to compete in high school sports because of a heart murmur that occurred in tandem with a rapid growth spurt.<ref>[[#Rei93|Reidenbaugh 1993]]: 106</ref> Gibson was named to the All-State basketball team during his senior year of high school by a newspaper in Lincoln, Nebraska, and soon after won a full [[athletic scholarship]] for basketball from [[Creighton University]].<ref>[[#Gib94|Gibson and Wheeler 1994]]: 23, 32</ref> [[Indiana State University|Indiana University]] had rejected him after stating their negro athlete quota had already been filled.
