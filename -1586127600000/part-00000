Created by Japanese video game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], he is portrayed as a citizen of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] and is one of Princess Peach's most loyal attendants, constantly working on her behalf. He is usually seen as a [[non-player character]] (NPC) who provides assistance to [[Mario]] and his friends in most games, but there are times when Toad(s) takes center stage and appears as a [[protagonist]], as seen in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', and ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]''.\n\nWhile Toad is the name of an individual, it also refers to an entire species (much like [[Yoshi]], [[Birdo]] and [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] from the ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'' series). However, in Japan, the species name is sometimes called {{nihongo|'''Kinoko-zoku'''|[[:ja:\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u65cf|\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u65cf]]}}, literally \"Mushroom People\" (which is an alternate name used in earlier localizations, along with \"Mushroom Retainers\"). In other words, Toad (Kinopio) is a member of the Toads (Kinokos / Mushroom People). In the ''Mario'' franchise, there are also some other individual Toad characters (e.g., Toadette, Toadsworth and Toadbert). The most prominent trait of a Toad is its large head that resembles a mushroom in shape and color - historically speculated as them wearing a mushroom hat, but eventually ruled out by Japanese video game designer [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-05-nintendo-finally-confirms-the-truth-about-toads-head|title=Nintendo finally confirms the truth about Toad's head|last=|first=|date=2018-02-05|website=|publisher=Eurogamer.net|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> Another common point of most Toads is their traditional vest.\n\nThe Toads usually play assisting roles in the ''Mario'' franchise and its action games, such as [[Toadsworth]] introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' and the ''Toad Brigade'' association in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''. Despite this, Toads also play the role as heroes in some games. Such a case included the 2 Toads (yellow and blue) who were featured as playable characters along with Mario and [[Luigi]] in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]''. The 2 Toads (yellow and blue) return as playable characters later on in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' as well as ''[[New Super Luigi U]]''. Toad himself (in a blue palette in reference to his original sprite from ''Super Mario Bros. 2'') returns as one of the playable characters in ''Super Mario 3D World''. The Wii U title ''Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker'' cast Captain Toad into the spotlight; thus, marking it as the first game in 20 years since ''Wario's Woods'' to have a Toad as the main star as well as the first title to have Toad as the titular character.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nToad and the mushroom people were first seen in the game ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' where the species was revealed to comprise the majority of the population of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. Toad's design was made directly from the power up the [[Super Mushroom]], as well as the game's general association with [[mushrooms]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page4.jsp|title=Shigeru Miyamto interview: Iwata asks Mario History Volume 1: Page 4|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2009-12-18}}</ref> [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the creator of the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], reasons that Toad's creation was that of being a character that has a simplistic design; yet, still appears cute and lovely and pleasing to everybody.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol2_page8.jsp|title=Shigeru Miyamto interview: Iwata asks Mario History Volume 2: Page 8|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref> In the game, the peaceful Toads of the Mushroom Kingdom had been turned into various objects such as bricks and pipes by the evil [[Bowser (character)|King Bowser]]; however, some of [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]]'s loyal servants, known as the \"Mushroom Retainers,\" were simply kidnapped. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smbhq.com/smb.htm|title=Super Mario Bros.|publisher=Super Mario Bros. Headquarters|accessdate=2009-12-18}}</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

Toad's Japanese name, \"Kinopio\", appears to be a mixture of the Japanese word for mushroom (\"kinoko\") and the Japanese name for the character, [[Pinocchio]] (\"Pinokio\"), which both roughly blend together to form the meaning of \"a real mushroom boy\" (as evidenced through Pinocchio's desire to become a real boy in his own tale).<ref>{{cite web |title=11 Origins of 11 Super Mario Characters' Names |url=http://www.11points.com/Games/11_Origins_of_11_Super_Mario_Characters'_Names |publisher=11points.com |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612201531/http://www.11points.com/Games/11_Origins_of_11_Super_Mario_Characters'_Names |archivedate=2012-06-12 }}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:ToadTV-NoCap.png|thumb|left|upright|Toad's appearances in the animated series sometimes depict him taking off his non-canon cap]]\n\nThough Toad has been seen wearing a mushroom hat on his head in the non-canon ''Mario'' cartoons, it has been confirmed by ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' producer [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]] that since the creation of the character in 1985 the mushroom cap was intended to be part of his head.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNYfoFcrZY |title=Super Mario Odyssey Dev. Talk - ft. Mr. Koizumi|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2018-02-06}}</ref>\n\nToad bears a similar appearance to the rest of his species with his large mushroom caps and clothes. He is very small in size, and has no legs visible, with just his typical brown shoes showing. Unlike other Toads, he features five red spots on his mushroom cap and wears a blue and yellow vest; however, his coloration will change if he gets a fire flower, as his cap's colors will be reversed while his clothes turn red. A yellow outline was added to his vest in the recent ''Mario'' games, starting with ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. Sometimes, Toad appears with a red vest, though he is most often seen with his blue vest. In the ''Mario'' cartoons, Toad has on occasion removed his non-canon mushroom cap, revealing three strands of hair. Toad is also seen with pants of a white color that resemble the base of a mushroom or toadstool stalk.\n\nAt most times, Toad is portrayed as a rather cowardly character. Despite his fears, Toad is usually one of the few people who tries his best to support [[Mario]] when he is on his adventures, from providing items to actually adventuring alongside the hero on his quest. Despite the fact that Toad is usually seen as a cheerful character, he can get extremely distressed when a major event occurs, such as the kidnapping of the [[Princess Peach|princess]].\n\nHe has been mentioned to being a hard working Toad with a strong loyalty to his Princess and friends. In many games, such as [[Super Mario 64]], Toad is helpful to [[Mario]] and his crew on their search for Peach, despite the fact Toad is portrayed as quite a shy character. In ''Luigi's Mansion'', he is seen crying in certain places because he cares so much about [[Mario]] getting kidnapped by ghosts, he was sent to the mansion to look for Mario in commands of Princess Peach. He was extremely loyal because he was scared and feared that he could get captured too. In ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', five colored Toads are trapped in paintings by [[King Boo]].\n\n===Abilities===\nThrough the various games that Toad is playable in, he has been shown with different unique abilities that differ from the other characters in the series. In ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', the game describes him as being the strongest and fastest character in the game with 5 out of 5 stars each, but with a weak jumping ability, rated at 2 stars. In ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', Toad has the unique ability to run up walls and make strong kicks. Toad is once again given superhuman strength in the game, as he is able to lift and throw enemies around; however, these abilities have not been seen since this game. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', Toad shares many of the moves and [[Mario#Abilities|abilities]] of Mario and Luigi, such as the ground pound and wall jumping as represented by the yellow and blue Toads.<ref>{{cite web |title= New Super Mario Bros.

(series)|Super Smash Bros. series]]'', Toad is shown to emit [[spore]]s like a real mushroom whenever he is attacked, as shown when Peach uses her standard special move.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/peach.html|title=Princess Peach moveset Super Smash Bros.

Toad exhibits a similar technique in ''[[Mario Sports Mix]]'' where he is capable of using the spores to cause mushrooms to sprout from the ground, and his special move is also based on this skill. He is also capable of using these emitted spores as a shield against various attacks in this game.<ref>{{cite web |title= Toad's profile (Mario Sports Mix at Nintendo) |url=http://mariosportsmix.nintendo.com/#/characters/details/toad|publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:ToadWario'sWoods.gif|thumb|Toad throwing an enemy from ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', the first game that starred him as the sole protagonist]]\n\nToad and his race of mushroom people made their debut appearance in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' where they play a minimal role in the game. They appear at the end of every stage as the Mushroom Retainers (who serve the princess) once Mario or Luigi defeats [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], rewarding the heroes with the message: \"Thank you Mario!

In the American ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', Toad got his first individual appearance and was given a bigger role as one of the four playable characters. In ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Toad appears in the Toad houses where he provides items and extra lives for Mario to take on his journey. Toad, however, is the main protagonist of ''Wario's Woods'', where he is trying to prevent [[Wario]] from taking over the woods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/wii/online/virtualconsole/games/detail/Q3TJhfvkUiLDeT6Brt3L2AyaWRCF0djg|title=Wario's Woods at Nintendo: Wii:Virtual Console:Games|publisher=Nintendo|date=2010-01-26|accessdate=2010-01-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509071622/http://www.nintendo.com/wii/online/virtualconsole/games/detail/Q3TJhfvkUiLDeT6Brt3L2AyaWRCF0djg|archivedate=2010-05-09}}</ref> Eventually with the help of [[Birdo]] and a fairy named Wanda, Toad fights Wario and in the end saves the woods from the clutches of the evil antagonist, restoring peace to the area.<ref name=\"Joystiqwario\">{{cite web|author=Wesley Fenlon |title=Born for Wii: Wario's Woods|publisher=Joystiq|date=2006-12-02| accessdate=2009-09-08|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/12/02/born-for-wii-warios-woods/}}</ref>\n\nThe 3D Mario games introduced Toad's role as a helper who would provide assistance to Mario if he needed it, thus making him one of Mario's major allies. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Toad explains the backstory to Mario, as well as telling him what he has to do to proceed in the game. In the game's remake ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', Toad appears with the same role; however, he is given character-specific remarks (such as mistaking Luigi for Mario in green clothes or thinking that Wario would betray the rest of the group). In ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'', Toad appears in various parts of the mansion as a save point. Different colored Toads appear in ''Super Mario Sunshine'' as Peach's attendants. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Toads appear at the beginning of the game as some of the citizens of Toad Town. Later on, a group of Toads appear as the ''Toad Brigade'' led by new character, Captain Toad, the captain of the brigade, who attempt to help Mario or Luigi retrieve the Power Stars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks_vol2_page5.jsp |title=Iwata Asks: Super Mario Galaxy |publisher=www.us.wii.com |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHhqTRtYFw |title=Miiverse |publisher=www.miiverse.nintendo.net |date=2012-05-12 |accessdate=2012-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501195018/https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHhqTRtYFw# |archive-date=2015-05-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Toad himself appears in the intro of the game, where he is holding hands with [[Toadette]] as the two look at the night sky.

The Toad runs the fastest but jumps the lowest and falls faster. Captain Toad later starred in [[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker|his eponymous spin-off game]] a year after ''Super Mario 3D World'' was released.\n\nIn ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', Toad and four others (yellow, blue, green and purple) act as assistants to Professor E. Gadd, who had sent them to investigate the mansions before Luigi had arrived. Throughout the game, Luigi meets up with the Toads, who help him uncover secrets in the mansions.\n\nThroughout the ''Mario'' RPG series, Toad is featured as more of a minor character due to the large amounts of generic toads which appear in the games who seem to replace his role as a helper. Regardless, in the times he does appear, Toad is once again a minor character who just gives a backstory to Mario and the others. In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', Toad appears as a major NPC character who teaches Mario about the different skills to use in battles in the beginning as the duo heads to the Mushroom Kingdom (though Toad had to be saved by Mario along the way as he is kidnapped frequently by enemies). Toad appears more throughout the game, for example as part of Mario's nightmare. Toad appears as a playable character in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' for a short time when the player is exploring around Mario and Luigi's house. In ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'', Toad is kidnapped earlier in the game along with Mario and Luigi by the [[Hammer Bros.]]. However, Toad appears as a playable character in two of the minigames in the game. Toad appears in ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' in 3 aspects of the game. He appears in the intro, telling Mario and Luigi that Princess Peach has been kidnapped, and later appears in the Arcade mini-game Mansion Patrol. Additionally, Toad is one of the 256 Catch Cards in the game. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'', a mysterious [[infection]] called \"The Blorbs\" causes the Toads to inflate to many times their normal size and roll around uncontrollably.<ref name=\"dailyrpg\">{{cite web|author=Chris Buffa |title=Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story Review (DS) |publisher=[[GameDaily]] |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/games/mario--luigi-bowsers-inside-story/ds/game-reviews/review/8778/2334/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907021312/http://www.gamedaily.com/games/mario--luigi-bowsers-inside-story/ds/game-reviews/review/8778/2334/ |archivedate=September 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Other appearances===\nToad has appeared in many of the various ''Mario'' spin-off games.

In ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'', Toad appears as a team member whose chemistry refers to his background; for example, he has good chemistry with Princess Peach and Toadette but bad chemistry with Wario. Toad also appears in the sequel, ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]'', again as a team member along with other differently colored toads. He also appears as a team member with good techniques in ''[[Mario Strikers]]'' and he also appears in its sequel ''[[Mario Strikers Charged]]'' with the same role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/sites/mariostrikerscharged/|title= Mario Strikers Charged Official Website |publisher=Nintendo |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> His sidekick role is retained in ''[[Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix]]'', where he accompanies either Mario or Luigi to help get back the musical keys from the villains of the game.

Another Mystery Mushroom costume based on Captain Toad from ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]'' was also made available through an update. In ''[[Super Mario Run]]'', Toad is one of six playable characters and it can be unlocked by connecting a [[My Nintendo]] account. In addition, he is the referee of Toad Rally if players use Toadette.\n\nIn ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' he is a referee along with [[List of recurring characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Cream the Rabbit|Cream the Rabbit]], a [[Lakitu]], and other Mario and Sonic characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/preview/14007 |title=Wii Preview: Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games |publisher=Nintendo World Report |author=Steven Rodriguez |date=2007-07-14 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> In its sequel, ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]'', Toad appears in the adventure mode and as well as a host.

Toad's role in the show was to be the sidekick to the Mario Bros. (as Luigi was a major character rather than a sidekick). He remained on the show when it spun off into ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', allowing them to live in his house. During the show he got alternate forms such as The Toad Warrior, Fire Toad and even Baby Toad; however, these forms of Toad have not made an appearance outside of the show. Due to his absence in the ''[[Super Mario World]]'' game, Toad did not make an appearance in [[Super Mario World (TV series)|the TV show of ''Super Mario World'']] with [[Yoshi]] and Oogtar (the latter having the same voice actor as Toad) instead taking his place. Toad appeared in the [[Nintendo Comics System|''Super Mario Bros.'' comic books]] published by [[Valiant Comics|Valiant]] as well. In these comics, Toad often followed Mario on his adventures, seemingly replacing Luigi as the hero's sidekick. He was a regular companion for King Toadstool, and even indulged in the King's activities. Played by [[Mojo Nixon]], Toad appeared as a street musician in the non-canon [[Super Mario Bros.

Created by Japanese video game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], he is portrayed as a citizen of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] and is one of Princess Peach's most loyal attendants; constantly working on her behalf. He is usually seen as a [[non-player character]] (NPC) who provides assistance to [[Mario]] and his friends in most games, but there are times when Toad(s) takes center stage and appears as a [[protagonist]], as seen in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', and ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]''.\n\nWhile Toad is the name of an individual, it also refers to an entire species (much like [[Yoshi]], [[Birdo]] and [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] from the ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'' series). However, in Japan, the species name is sometimes called {{nihongo|'''Kinoko-zoku'''|[[:ja:\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u65cf|\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u65cf]]}}, literally \"Mushroom People\" (which is an alternate name used in earlier localizations, along with \"Mushroom Retainers\"). In other words, Toad (Kinopio) is a member of the Toads (Kinokos / Mushroom People). In the ''Mario'' franchise, there are also some other individual Toad characters (e.g., Toadette, Toadsworth and Toadbert). The most prominent trait of a Toad is its large head that resembles a mushroom in shape and color - historically speculated as them wearing a mushroom hat, but eventually ruled out by Japanese video game designer [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-05-nintendo-finally-confirms-the-truth-about-toads-head|title=Nintendo finally confirms the truth about Toad's head|last=|first=|date=2018-02-05|website=|publisher=Eurogamer.net|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> Another common point of most Toads is their traditional vest.\n\nThe Toads usually play assisting roles in the ''Mario'' franchise and its action games, such as [[Toadsworth]] introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' and the ''Toad Brigade'' association in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''. Despite this, Toads also play the role as heroes in some games. Such a case included the 2 Toads (yellow and blue) who were featured as playable characters along with Mario and [[Luigi]] in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]''. The 2 Toads (yellow and blue) return as playable characters later on in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' as well as ''[[New Super Luigi U]]''. Toad himself (in a blue palette in reference to his original sprite from ''Super Mario Bros. 2'') returns as one of the playable characters in ''Super Mario 3D World''. The Wii U title ''Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker'' cast Captain Toad into the spotlight; thus, marking it as the first game in 20 years since ''Wario's Woods'' to have a Toad as the main star as well as the first title to have Toad as the titular character.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nToad and the mushroom people were first seen in the game ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' where the species was revealed to comprise the majority of the population of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. Toad's design was made directly from the power up the [[Super Mushroom]], as well as the game's general association with [[mushrooms]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page4.jsp|title=Shigeru Miyamto interview: Iwata asks Mario History Volume 1: Page 4|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2009-12-18}}</ref> [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the creator of the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], reasons that Toad's creation was that of being a character that has a simplistic design; yet, still appears cute and lovely and pleasing to everybody.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol2_page8.jsp|title=Shigeru Miyamto interview: Iwata asks Mario History Volume 2: Page 8|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref> In the game, the peaceful Toads of the Mushroom Kingdom had been turned into various objects such as bricks and pipes by the evil [[Bowser (character)|King Bowser]]; however, some of [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]]'s loyal servants, known as the \"Mushroom Retainers,\" were simply kidnapped. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smbhq.com/smb.htm|title=Super Mario Bros.|publisher=Super Mario Bros. Headquarters|accessdate=2009-12-18}}</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', the developers at Nintendo decided between four characters to be playable in the game: Princess Peach, Toad, [[Wario]] and [[Waluigi]] (all suggestions made by fans).<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|author=Kevin Gifford|title=Miyamoto on Wario Fart Attacks (Development of New Super Mario Bros.

Toad's Japanese name, \"Kinopio\", appears to be a mixture of the Japanese word for mushroom (\"kinoko\") and the Japanese name for the character, [[Pinocchio]] (\"Pinokio\"), which both roughly blend together to form the meaning of \"a real mushroom boy\" (as evidenced through Pinocchio's desire to become a real boy in his own tale).<ref>{{cite web |title=11 Origins of 11 Super Mario Characters' Names |url=http://www.11points.com/Games/11_Origins_of_11_Super_Mario_Characters'_Names |publisher=11points.com |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612201531/http://www.11points.com/Games/11_Origins_of_11_Super_Mario_Characters'_Names |archivedate=2012-06-12 }}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:ToadTV-NoCap.png|thumb|left|upright|Toad's appearances in the animated series sometimes depict him taking off his non-canon cap]]\n\nThough Toad has been seen wearing a mushroom hat on his head in the non-canon ''Mario'' cartoons, it has been confirmed by ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' producer [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]] that since the creation of the character in 1985 the mushroom cap was intended to be part of his head.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNYfoFcrZY |title=Super Mario Odyssey Dev. Talk - ft. Mr. Koizumi|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2018-02-06}}</ref>\n\nToad bears a similar appearance to the rest of his species with his large mushroom caps and clothes. He is very small in size, and has no legs visible, with just his typical brown shoes showing. Unlike other Toads, he features five red spots on his mushroom cap and wears a blue and yellow vest; however, his coloration will change if he gets a fire flower, as his cap's colors will be reversed while his clothes turn red. A yellow outline was added to his vest in the recent ''Mario'' games, starting with ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. Sometimes, Toad appears with a red vest, though he is most often seen with his blue vest. In the ''Mario'' cartoons, Toad has on occasion removed his non-canon mushroom cap, revealing three strands of hair. Toad is also seen with pants of a white color that resemble the base of a mushroom or toadstool stalk.\n\nAt most times, Toad is portrayed as a rather cowardly character. Despite his fears, Toad is usually one of the few people who tries his best to support [[Mario]] when he is on his adventures, from providing items to actually adventuring alongside the hero on his quest. Despite the fact that Toad is usually seen as a cheerful character, he can get extremely distressed when a major event occurs, such as the kidnapping of the [[Princess Peach|princess]].\n\nHe has been mentioned to being a hard working Toad with a strong loyalty to his Princess and friends. In many games, such as [[Super Mario 64]], Toad is helpful to [[Mario]] and his crew on their search for Peach, despite the fact Toad is portrayed as quite a shy character. In ''Luigi's Mansion'', he is seen crying in certain places because he cares so much about [[Mario]] getting kidnapped by ghosts, he was sent to the mansion to look for Mario in commands of Princess Peach. He was extremely loyal because he was scared and feared that he could get captured too. In ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', five colored Toads are trapped in paintings by [[King Boo]].\n\n===Abilities===\nThrough the various games that Toad is playable in, he has been shown with different unique abilities that differ from the other characters in the series. In ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', the game describes him as being the strongest and fastest character in the game with 5 out of 5 stars each, but with a weak jumping ability, rated at 2 stars. In ''[[Wario's Woods]]'', Toad has the unique ability to run up walls and make strong kicks. Toad is once again given superhuman strength in the game, as he is able to lift and throw enemies around; however, these abilities have not been seen since this game. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', Toad shares many of the moves and [[Mario#Abilities|abilities]] of Mario and Luigi, such as the ground pound and wall jumping as represented by the yellow and blue Toads.<ref>{{cite web |title= New Super Mario Bros.

Toad exhibits a similar technique in ''[[Mario Sports Mix]]'' where he is capable of using the spores to cause mushrooms to sprout from the ground, and his special move is also based on this skill.

In the American ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', Toad got his first individual appearance and was given a bigger role as one of the four playable characters. In ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Toad appears in the Toad houses where he provides items and extra lives for Mario to take on his journey. Toad, however, is the main protagonist of ''Wario's Woods'', where he is trying to prevent [[Wario]] from taking over the woods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/wii/online/virtualconsole/games/detail/Q3TJhfvkUiLDeT6Brt3L2AyaWRCF0djg|title=Wario's Woods at Nintendo: Wii:Virtual Console:Games|publisher=Nintendo|date=2010-01-26|accessdate=2010-01-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509071622/http://www.nintendo.com/wii/online/virtualconsole/games/detail/Q3TJhfvkUiLDeT6Brt3L2AyaWRCF0djg|archivedate=2010-05-09}}</ref> Eventually with the help of [[Birdo]] and a fairy named Wanda, Toad fights Wario and in the end saves the woods from the clutches of the evil antagonist, restoring peace to the area.<ref name=\"Joystiqwario\">{{cite web|author=Wesley Fenlon |title=Born for Wii: Wario's Woods|publisher=Joystiq|date=2006-12-02| accessdate=2009-09-08|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/12/02/born-for-wii-warios-woods/}}</ref>\n\nThe 3D Mario games introduced Toad's role as a helper who would provide assistance to Mario if he needed it, thus making him one of Mario's major allies. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Toad explains the backstory to Mario, as well as telling him what he has to do to proceed in the game. In the game's remake ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', Toad appears with the same role; however, he is given character-specific remarks (such as mistaking Luigi for Mario in green clothes or thinking that Wario would betray the rest of the group). In ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'', Toad appears in various parts of the mansion as a save point. Different colored Toads appear in ''Super Mario Sunshine'' as Peach's attendants. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Toads appear at the beginning of the game as some of the citizens of Toad Town. Later on, a group of Toads appear as the ''Toad Brigade'' led by new character, Captain Toad, the captain of the brigade, who attempt to help Mario or Luigi retrieve the Power Stars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks_vol2_page5.jsp |title=Iwata Asks: Super Mario Galaxy |publisher=www.us.wii.com |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHhqTRtYFw |title=Miiverse |publisher=www.miiverse.nintendo.net |date=2012-05-12 |accessdate=2012-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501195018/https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHhqTRtYFw# |archive-date=2015-05-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Toad himself appears in the intro of the game, where he is holding hands with [[Toadette]] as the two look at the night sky.

The Toad runs the fastest but jumps the lowest and falls faster. Captain Toad later starred in [[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker|his eponymous spin-off game]] a year after ''Super Mario 3D World'' was released.\n\nIn ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', Toad and four others (yellow, blue, green and purple) act as assistants to Professor E. Gadd, who had sent them to investigate the mansions before Luigi had arrived. Throughout the game, Luigi meets up with the Toads, who help him uncover secrets in the mansions.\n\nThroughout the ''Mario'' RPG series, Toad is featured as more of a minor character due to the large amounts of generic toads which appear in the games who seem to replace his role as a helper. Regardless, in the times he does appear, Toad is once again a minor character who just gives a backstory to Mario and the others. In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', Toad appears as a major NPC character who teaches Mario about the different skills to use in battles in the beginning as the duo heads to the Mushroom Kingdom (though Toad had to be saved by Mario along the way as he is kidnapped frequently by enemies). Toad appears more throughout the game, for example as part of Mario's nightmare. Toad appears as a playable character in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' for a short time when the player is exploring around Mario and Luigi's house. In ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'', Toad is kidnapped earlier in the game along with Mario and Luigi by the [[Hammer Bros.]]. However, Toad appears as a playable character in two of the minigames in the game. Toad appears in ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' in 3 aspects of the game. He appears in the intro, telling Mario and Luigi that Princess Peach has been kidnapped, and later appears in the Arcade mini-game Mansion Patrol. Additionally, Toad is one of the 256 Catch Cards in the game. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'', a mysterious [[infection]] called \"The Blorbs\" causes the Toads to inflate to many times their normal size and roll around uncontrollably.<ref name=\"dailyrpg\">{{cite web|author=Chris Buffa |title=Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story Review (DS) |publisher=[[GameDaily]] |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/games/mario--luigi-bowsers-inside-story/ds/game-reviews/review/8778/2334/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907021312/http://www.gamedaily.com/games/mario--luigi-bowsers-inside-story/ds/game-reviews/review/8778/2334/ |archivedate=September 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Other appearances===\nToad has appeared in many of the various ''Mario'' spin-off games.

In ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'', Toad appears as a team member whose chemistry refers to his background; for example, he has good chemistry with Princess Peach and Toadette but bad chemistry with Wario. Toad also appears in the sequel, ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]'', again as a team member along with other differently colored toads. He also appears as a team member with good techniques in ''[[Mario Strikers]]'' and he also appears in its sequel ''[[Mario Strikers Charged]]'' with the same role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/sites/mariostrikerscharged/|title= Mario Strikers Charged Official Website |publisher=Nintendo |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> His sidekick role is retained in ''[[Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix]]'', where he accompanies either Mario or Luigi to help get back the musical keys from the villains of the game.

A Mystery Mushroom costume based on Toad can be unlocked, and Toad appears at the end of the 10-Mario challenge and the easy mode of the 100-Mario challenge, saying that [[Princess Peach]] has been taken to another castle (kind of like what happened in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''). Another Mystery Mushroom costume based on Captain Toad from ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]'' was also made available through an update. In ''[[Super Mario Run]]'', Toad is one of six playable characters and it can be unlocked by connecting a [[My Nintendo]] account. In addition, he is the referee of Toad Rally if players use Toadette.\n\nIn ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' he is a referee along with [[List of recurring characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Cream the Rabbit|Cream the Rabbit]], a [[Lakitu]], and other Mario and Sonic characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/preview/14007 |title=Wii Preview: Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games |publisher=Nintendo World Report |author=Steven Rodriguez |date=2007-07-14 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> In its sequel, ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]'', Toad appears in the adventure mode and as well as a host.

Toad's role in the show was to be the sidekick to the Mario Bros. (as Luigi was a major character rather than a sidekick). He remained on the show when it spun off into ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', allowing them to live in his house. During the show he got alternate forms such as The Toad Warrior, Fire Toad and even Baby Toad; however, these forms of Toad have not made an appearance outside of the show. Due to his absence in the ''[[Super Mario World]]'' game, Toad did not make an appearance in [[Super Mario World (TV series)|the TV show of ''Super Mario World'']] with [[Yoshi]] and Oogtar (the latter having the same voice actor as Toad) instead taking his place. Toad appeared in the [[Nintendo Comics System|''Super Mario Bros.'' comic books]] published by [[Valiant Comics|Valiant]] as well. In these comics, Toad often followed Mario on his adventures, seemingly replacing Luigi as the hero's sidekick.

Portrayed by actor [[Rob Wiethoff]], he is the main protagonist of the 2010 video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and its [[standalone expansion]], ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', and the secondary protagonist in its 2018 prequel, ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''.\n\nIn his younger years, John was an [[outlaw]] who rode in the infamous Van der Linde Gang, committing multiple crimes. After the gang's downfall and eventual disbandment in 1899, he tries leaving his life of crime behind to become a [[rancher]] and a family man. After twelve years of hiding, he is located by the [[Bureau of Investigation]] in 1911 and forced to hunt down the last surviving members of his former gang in exchange for his family and his freedom.\n\nThe character was well received, with many critics citing his maturity, moral complexity and ambiguity, and quest for atonement as focal points of the first game. Wiethoff's portrayal of Marston was also met with acclaim.\n\n==Character development==\n''Red Dead Redemption'' required a large amount of voice work in order to feel alive. The team felt that the amount of voice work required for ''Redemption'' had been previously achieved in ''Grand Theft Auto IV'', with prior experience to such amounts dating back to ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' (2004) and ''[[Bully (video game)|Bully]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"ItWW3\">{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2009/05/11/red-dead-redemption-into-the-wild-west?page=3 |title=Red Dead Redemption: Into the Wild West |page=3 |last=Onyett |first=Charles |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=September 24, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084207/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/11/red-dead-redemption-into-the-wild-west?page=3 |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> To cast the characters, the team held auditions; until actors were officially signed to the project, it was only known as an \"untitled video game project\", for secrecy.<ref name=\"Spawny\">{{cite web |url=http://rdrfanaticssaloon.blogspot.com/2012/02/spawny0908-interviews-rob-wiethoff.html |title=Spawny0908 Interviews Rob Wiethoff Voice of John Marston!!! |last=Robinson |first=Brittany |work=Red Dead Redemption Fanatic's Saloon |publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] |date=February 6, 2012 |accessdate=September 30, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6T5XEBwlp?url=http://rdrfanaticssaloon.blogspot.com/2012/02/spawny0908-interviews-rob-wiethoff.html |archivedate=October 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the game, [[Rob Wiethoff]] portrayed John Marston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/6/19/4406600/small-town-man-John-Marston |title=What happened to John Marston |last=Stafford |first=Patrick |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 19, 2013 |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Sp79ewFK?url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/6/19/4406600/small-town-man-John-Marston |archivedate=September 24, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe character of John Marston was developed to be a \"family man\".<ref name=\"USAToday\">{{cite web |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2010/05/red-dead-redemption-qa-with-rockstars-dan-houser-1/1#.VCpW16vtn68 |title='Red Dead Redemption' Q&A with Rockstar's Dan Houser |last=Snider |first=Mike |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=September 30, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SyA0dta8?url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2010/05/red-dead-redemption-qa-with-rockstars-dan-houser-1/1 |archivedate=September 30, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The team developed him as a nuanced character, as opposed to a straightforward hero or villain, in order to provide an interesting experience.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-exclusive-qanda/1100-6249985/|title=Red Dead Redemption Exclusive Q&A|first=Gamespot|last=Staff|date=10 February 2010|publisher=}}</ref> Wiethoff considered Marston to be very determined about his goals. \"He was a man about things,\" Wiethoff remarked.<ref name=\"Spawny\"/> He gave the character a perceptible sense of weariness and unlike other gaming protagonists, Marston is not a hero but a criminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption/2018/10/22/18010610/red-dead-redemption-john-marston-rob-wiethoff-rdr|title=The voice of Red Dead: What happened to John Marston|publisher=}}</ref> Technical director Ted Carson felt that Marston became interesting due to the combination of cynicism and realism.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Wiethoff felt that Marston was aware that his past actions were \"wrong\", resulting in his attempt to abandon his former life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nave360.com/695/ |title=Rob Wiethoff Interview |last=Gorgon |first=Sebastian |publisher=Nave360 |date=October 12, 2010 |accessdate=October 5, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6T5PFtNnK?url=http://www.nave360.com/695/ |archivedate=October 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> He stated that Marston's early decisions in his life were a direct result of his need for acceptance. \"I don't know if he knew that what he was doing was wrong or not,\" Wiethoff said.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thegamingliberty.com/2011/03/john-martson-speaks-an-interview-with-rob-wiethoff/ |title=John Marston Speaks!

John spent a few years in an orphanage before running away. When John was threatened to be [[lynching|lynched]] after being caught stealing at the age of 12, he was saved by Dutch van der Linde, who took him into his gang and raised him.{{sfn|Price|2018|p=361}} When Abigail Roberts joined the gang, she and John fell in love and had a son, Jack. Prior to the events of the game, John is involved in the gang's botched ferry robbery in Blackwater; when the gang seek shelter in the mountains, John scouts ahead but gets lost in the blizzard and attacked by wolves. He is later saved by [[Arthur Morgan (Red Dead)|Arthur Morgan]] and Javier Escuella.\n\nOnce John has recovered, he joins the gang on some tasks before planning and executing a successful train robbery. After Jack is kidnapped, John takes part in the assault against the Braithwaites' manor and is present upon his return. During a failed bank robbery, John is captured and incarcerated. Arthur and Sadie rescue him, much to the disdain of Dutch; growing weary of Dutch's attitude and protective of John's family, Arthur warns John to leave the gang when the time is right. John is later left for dead by Dutch during a train robbery, but returns to the camp as Arthur is confronting Dutch and Micah. When Pinkertons invade the camp, Arthur and John flee. John returns to his family at Arthur's wishes, while the latter dies after protecting him.\n\nEight years later, in 1907, John finds honest work with Abigail, but when John fights back against outlaws threatening his employer, Abigail leaves with Jack. John works to get her back by earning enough money to buy a property at Beecher's Hope. He builds a ranch with the help of Uncle and Charles Smith, while Sadie provides him with jobs to pay off his loans. After Abigail returns, John proposes. With Sadie and Charles, John attacks Micah's new gang, where they find Dutch. In a [[Mexican standoff]], Dutch shoots Micah, letting John finish him off, before leaving. John and Abigail later get married at their ranch.\n\n===''Red Dead Redemption''===\nIn 1911, U.S. federal agents Edgar Ross and Archer Fordham from the [[Bureau of Investigation|BOI]] command John to act as bounty hunter and apprehend his former outlaw friends. To both motivate and ensure that John will comply, the agents kidnap his son Jack and wife Abigail, and hold them hostage, promising their release upon the completion of John's obligations.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"And You Will Know the Truth\")<br/> '''John Marston:''' I tried to leave, 'til those suits back there came a-knockin'. Threatened to kill my wife and son if I didn't go after him.\" </ref> Beginning in the town of Blackwater, John boards a train headed west to the town of Armadillo, where he meets with a guide named Jake. Jake guides Marston to Fort Mercer, where Marion \u201cBill\u201d Williamson and his own gang have taken refuge. Marston confronts and tries to reason with Bill outside the gates, but is instead shot down, suffering a bullet to the ribs.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"Exodus in America\")</ref> He is found by a passerby: a woman named Bonnie MacFarlane. Bonnie takes the wounded Marston to her ranch in Hennigan's Stead; while he recovers, Marston runs errands for Bonnie and her father, Drew, as a way to show his gratitude for saving his life.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"New Friends, Old Problems\")</ref> After his recovery, John works with many individuals throughout the state of New Austin, all of whom agree to help him enter and assault Fort Mercer. Irish is able to locate a gatling gun, which is then concealed inside Nigel West Dickens' wagon. The group uses West Dickens' wagon and his snake oil business as a trojan horse, and assault Bill's gang at Fort Mercer. John, West Dickens, Irish, Seth, Jonah, Eli, and Marshall Johnson all survive and emerge victorious, but Bill is nowhere to be found in the fort. A surviving member of Bill's gang reveals that Bill has fled to [[Mexico]] to seek the help of Javier Escuella, another member of Marston's former gang.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"The Assault on Fort Mercer\")</ref>\n\nMarston, with the help of Irish, takes a raft to a northern region of Mexico called Nuevo Para\u00edso, in pursuit of both Williamson and Escuella. There, John becomes unwillingly entangled in a [[Mexican Revolution|civil war]] between the rebels led by Abraham Reyes and soldiers in the region, led by Colonel Agustin Allende. Marston, only wanting information regarding Williamson and Escuella, reluctantly works for both sides. However, Allende betrays John, who is saved from execution by Reyes, and from there on, goes to work permanently with the rebels.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"Cowards Die Many Times\")</ref> He eventually locates Escuella, who is hiding in a government fortress named El Presidio. In an assault on El Presidio, the player can decide whether to kill or capture and return Escuella to the Federal Agents (either choice results in Escuella's body being turned in to Edgar Ross and Archer Fordham).<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"The Gates of El Presidio\")</ref> The rebels then assault Allende's palace in Escalera. A chase ensues, but Marston and Reyes are able to stop Allende's stagecoach (which is also carrying Williamson). Allende is shot dead by Reyes. Bill attempts to reach for his pistol, but both John and Reyes fire at him, killing him.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"An Appointed Time\")</ref>\n\nWith the civil war in the region quelled and both Williamson and Escuella eliminated, Marston bids a farewell to Reyes, and heads back to Blackwater to collect his family. However, Edgar Ross tells Marston that his mission is not over, and that he must kill his former mentor, Dutch van der Linde. John is reluctant to do so, because of the fact that Dutch raised, fed, and cared for him; Marston, wanting the safety of his family ensured, knows he does not have a choice and accepts.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']]  (Mission: \"Bear One Another's Burdens\")</ref> Dutch is leading a gang of angered Native Americans who share his resentment of the government in the snowy mountains of Tall Trees. John attempts several unsuccessful attacks on Dutch and his operations. Ross and Fordham prevent his crimes in Blackwater while Van der Linde gang turnout Nastas and Professor Harold MacDougal of Yale try to convince the Native Americans to betray Dutch. This culminates with Marston, the Bureau, and the US Army assault Cochinay, Dutch's hideout. John then chases Dutch through a cave system that eventually leads onto a cliff. Confronted and nowhere to go, Dutch then says he was only fighting for what he believed in and that even after his death, the government will only find another individual to hunt down to \"justify their wages\". Dutch then steps off the cliff, committing suicide. With his old gang dead, John's family is returned to his ranch on Beecher's Hope, and is let go of the law's affairs.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"And The Truth Will Set You Free\")</ref>\n\nJohn returns to find his ranch in poor condition (due to the fact it was left in the care of a former gang member, a drunk named Uncle).<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"The Outlaw's Return\")</ref> John begins to live as he always wanted: taking care of his ranch and family. John grows a stronger bond with his son Jack and his wife Abigail. John teaches Jack good morality and mannerisms; John does not want Jack to kill needlessly and live like an outlaw in the future. The days on his ranch are more or less peaceful, until one day, when Uncle spots US army soldiers riding to the ranch; Edgar Ross, believing John to be the last member of the Van der Linde gang that must be killed, reneges on his promise and assaults John's ranch. John, Jack, and Uncle all bear arms and defend themselves; Uncle, however, is shot and killed. John defends his family as they flee to the barn on his ranch. There, he shares a final moment with Abigail and Jack; he instructs them to ride away and escape on horseback. They do so, and John, still in the barn, peers through the doors to see a line of soldiers, all ready to fire. He pushes open the doors and draws his gun, taking down as many soldiers as he can before they open fire. John is killed after a short struggle. Abigail and Jack return after the soldiers and Ross leave the ranch, and mourn over John's body. John's body is buried on a hillside at his ranch.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"The Last Enemy That Shall Be Destroyed\")</ref>\n\nIn 1914, three years after John's death and shortly after Abigail's death, Jack, now 19 years old, decides to avenge his father. Jack manages to track down a retired Edgar Ross; the two duel, with Jack emerging victorious.\n\n===''Undead Nightmare''===\nIn ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', a [[canon (fiction)|non-canonical]], [[zombie apocalypse]]-themed [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate reality]], John finds that the world is plagued by a [[virus]] that brings the dead back to life with a taste for flesh. After killing an undead Uncle and tying up the infected Jack and Abigail, John rides to Blackwater, in search for a doctor. But he finds the town seemingly deserted, meeting Harold MacDougal, who had come back from Yale for \"another round of research\". Shortly afterwards, he is attacked by the undead Nastas and is also turned into a zombie. John purges Blackwater from the Undead and learns that the plague might be the fault of either Nigel West Dickens, Seth Briars, or the Mexicans. After visiting both men, John finds that neither has an idea what caused the virus and the only lead left is Mexico, which is rumored to be in better condition than America. Acquiring an army uniform, John heads to Mexico, only to find that the country is in even worse state. He learns from a nun that Abraham Reyes might be responsible and John heads there. He kills the zombified Reyes and finds a girl, who reveals that the reason for the virus is that Reyes had desecrated several catacombs beneath the government building, and had stolen an ancient [[Aztec]] mask, unbalancing order and unleashing the undead. John and the girl head down to the tombs and return the mask. John returns home to find that his family has been cured. Months later, after his death, John rises from his grave, as Seth has stolen the mask and once again caused the dead to rise. But John, being buried with [[holy water]], is a [[Revenants in fiction|revenant]] who still retains his soul and his capabilities to use weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption/2018/10/25/18022724/red-dead-redemption-undead-nightmare|title=Red Dead Redemption\u2019s Undead Nightmare was more than a trendy zombie game|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/the-good-and-bad-of-red-dead-redemptions-multiplayer-1829494342|title=The Good And Bad Of Red Dead Redemption's Multiplayer|first=Zack|last=Zwiezen|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Other appearances==\nIn ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'', the online mode of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', players can choose what their character is to look like by selecting between different parents; John is one of the special parents available, meaning that players can select John so that their character has a level of resemblance to him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51257/more-details-and-screens-from-the-grand-theft-auto-v-special-and.html |title=More Details and Screens from the Grand Theft Auto V Special and Collector's Edition Digital Content |author=R* Q |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=26 August 2013 |accessdate=3 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51422/some-more-details-on-grand-theft-auto-online.html |title=Some More Details on Grand Theft Auto Online |author=R* A |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=23 September 2013 |accessdate=3 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMarston's hat appears as an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in ''[[L.A.

Portrayed by actor [[Rob Wiethoff]], he is the main protagonist of the 2010 video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and its [[standalone expansion]], ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', and the secondary protagonist in its 2018 prequel, ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''.\n\nIn his younger years, John was an [[outlaw]] who rode in the infamous Van der Linde Gang, committing multiple crimes. After the gang's downfall and eventual disbandment in 1899, he tries leaving his life of crime behind to become a [[rancher]] and a family man. After twelve years of hiding, he is located by the [[Bureau of Investigation]] in 1911 and forced to hunt down the last surviving members of his former gang in exchange for his family and his freedom.\n\nThe character was well received, with many critics citing his maturity, moral complexity and ambiguity, and quest for atonement as focal points of the first game. Wiethoff's portrayal of Marston was also met with acclaim.\n\n==Character development==\n''Red Dead Redemption'' required a large amount of voice work in order to feel alive. The team felt that the amount of voice work required for ''Redemption'' had been previously achieved in ''Grand Theft Auto IV'', with prior experience to such amounts dating back to ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' (2004) and ''[[Bully (video game)|Bully]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"ItWW3\">{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2009/05/11/red-dead-redemption-into-the-wild-west?page=3 |title=Red Dead Redemption: Into the Wild West |page=3 |last=Onyett |first=Charles |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=September 24, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084207/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/11/red-dead-redemption-into-the-wild-west?page=3 |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> To cast the characters, the team held auditions; until actors were officially signed to the project, it was only known as an \"untitled video game project\", for secrecy.<ref name=\"Spawny\">{{cite web |url=http://rdrfanaticssaloon.blogspot.com/2012/02/spawny0908-interviews-rob-wiethoff.html |title=Spawny0908 Interviews Rob Wiethoff Voice of John Marston!!! |last=Robinson |first=Brittany |work=Red Dead Redemption Fanatic's Saloon |publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] |date=February 6, 2012 |accessdate=September 30, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6T5XEBwlp?url=http://rdrfanaticssaloon.blogspot.com/2012/02/spawny0908-interviews-rob-wiethoff.html |archivedate=October 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the game, [[Rob Wiethoff]] portrayed John Marston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/6/19/4406600/small-town-man-John-Marston |title=What happened to John Marston |last=Stafford |first=Patrick |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 19, 2013 |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Sp79ewFK?url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/6/19/4406600/small-town-man-John-Marston |archivedate=September 24, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe character of John Marston was developed to be a \"family man\".<ref name=\"USAToday\">{{cite web |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2010/05/red-dead-redemption-qa-with-rockstars-dan-houser-1/1#.VCpW16vtn68 |title='Red Dead Redemption' Q&A with Rockstar's Dan Houser |last=Snider |first=Mike |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=September 30, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SyA0dta8?url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2010/05/red-dead-redemption-qa-with-rockstars-dan-houser-1/1 |archivedate=September 30, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The team developed him as a nuanced character, as opposed to a straightforward hero or villain, in order to provide an interesting experience.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-exclusive-qanda/1100-6249985/|title=Red Dead Redemption Exclusive Q&A|first=Gamespot|last=Staff|date=10 February 2010|publisher=}}</ref> Wiethoff considered Marston to be very determined about his goals. \"He was a man about things,\" Wiethoff remarked.<ref name=\"Spawny\"/> He gave the character a perceptible sense of weariness and unlike other gaming protagonists, Marston is not a hero but a criminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption/2018/10/22/18010610/red-dead-redemption-john-marston-rob-wiethoff-rdr|title=The voice of Red Dead: What happened to John Marston|publisher=}}</ref> Technical director Ted Carson felt that Marston became interesting due to the combination of cynicism and realism.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Wiethoff felt that Marston was aware that his past actions were \"wrong\", resulting in his attempt to abandon his former life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nave360.com/695/ |title=Rob Wiethoff Interview |last=Gorgon |first=Sebastian |publisher=Nave360 |date=October 12, 2010 |accessdate=October 5, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6T5PFtNnK?url=http://www.nave360.com/695/ |archivedate=October 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> He stated that Marston's early decisions in his life were a direct result of his need for acceptance. \"I don't know if he knew that what he was doing was wrong or not,\" Wiethoff said.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thegamingliberty.com/2011/03/john-martson-speaks-an-interview-with-rob-wiethoff/ |title=John Marston Speaks!

Prior to the events of the game, John is involved in the gang's botched ferry robbery in Blackwater; when the gang seek shelter in the mountains, John scouts ahead but gets lost in the blizzard and attacked by wolves. He is later saved by [[Arthur Morgan (Red Dead)|Arthur Morgan]] and Javier Escuella.\n\nOnce John has recovered, he joins the gang on some tasks before planning and executing a successful train robbery. After Jack is kidnapped, John takes part in the assault against the Braithwaites' manor and is present upon his return. During a failed bank robbery, John is captured and incarcerated. Arthur and Sadie rescue him, much to the disdain of Dutch; growing weary of Dutch's attitude and protective of John's family, Arthur warns John to leave the gang when the time is right. John is later left for dead by Dutch during a train robbery, but returns to the camp as Arthur is confronting Dutch and Micah. When Pinkertons invade the camp, Arthur and John flee. John returns to his family at Arthur's wishes, while the latter dies after protecting him.\n\nEight years later, in 1907, John finds honest work with Abigail, but when John fights back against outlaws threatening his employer, Abigail leaves with Jack. John works to get her back by earning enough money to buy a property at Beecher's Hope. He builds a ranch with the help of Uncle and Charles Smith, while Sadie provides him with jobs to pay off his loans. After Abigail returns, John proposes. With Sadie and Charles, John attacks Micah's new gang, where they find Dutch. In a [[Mexican standoff]], Dutch shoots Micah, letting John finish him off, before leaving. John and Abigail later get married at their ranch.\n\n===''Red Dead Redemption''===\nIn 1911, U.S. federal agents Edgar Ross and Archer Fordham from the [[Bureau of Investigation|BOI]] command John to act as bounty hunter and apprehend his former outlaw friends.

Marston confronts and tries to reason with Bill outside the gates, but is instead shot down, suffering a bullet to the ribs.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"Exodus in America\")</ref> He is found by a passerby: a woman named Bonnie MacFarlane. Bonnie takes the wounded Marston to her ranch in Hennigan's Stead; while he recovers, Marston runs errands for Bonnie and her father, Drew, as a way to show his gratitude for saving his life.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"New Friends, Old Problems\")</ref> After his recovery, John works with many individuals throughout the state of New Austin, all of whom agree to help him enter and assault Fort Mercer. Irish is able to locate a gatling gun, which is then concealed inside Nigel West Dickens' wagon. The group uses West Dickens' wagon and his snake oil business as a trojan horse, and assault Bill's gang at Fort Mercer. John, West Dickens, Irish, Seth, Jonah, Eli, and Marshall Johnson all survive and emerge victorious, but Bill is nowhere to be found in the fort. A surviving member of Bill's gang reveals that Bill has fled to [[Mexico]] to seek the help of Javier Escuella, another member of Marston's former gang.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"The Assault on Fort Mercer\")</ref>\n\nMarston, with the help of Irish, takes a raft to a northern region of Mexico called Nuevo Para\u00edso, in pursuit of both Williamson and Escuella. There, John becomes unwillingly entangled in a [[Mexican Revolution|civil war]] between the rebels led by Abraham Reyes and soldiers in the region, led by Colonel Agustin Allende. Marston, only wanting information regarding Williamson and Escuella, reluctantly works for both sides. However, Allende betrays John, who is saved from execution by Reyes, and from there on, goes to work permanently with the rebels.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"Cowards Die Many Times\")</ref> He eventually locates Escuella, who is hiding in a government fortress named El Presidio. In an assault on El Presidio, the player can decide whether to kill or capture and return Escuella to the Federal Agents (either choice results in Escuella's body being turned in to Edgar Ross and Archer Fordham).<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"The Gates of El Presidio\")</ref> The rebels then assault Allende's palace in Escalera. A chase ensues, but Marston and Reyes are able to stop Allende's stagecoach (which is also carrying Williamson). Allende is shot dead by Reyes. Bill attempts to reach for his pistol, but both John and Reyes fire at him, killing him.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"An Appointed Time\")</ref>\n\nWith the civil war in the region quelled and both Williamson and Escuella eliminated, Marston bids a farewell to Reyes, and heads back to Blackwater to collect his family. However, Edgar Ross tells Marston that his mission is not over, and that he must kill his former mentor, Dutch van der Linde. John is reluctant to do so, because of the fact that Dutch raised, fed, and cared for him; Marston, wanting the safety of his family ensured, knows he does not have a choice and accepts.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']]  (Mission: \"Bear One Another's Burdens\")</ref> Dutch is leading a gang of angered Native Americans who share his resentment of the government in the snowy mountains of Tall Trees. John attempts several unsuccessful attacks on Dutch and his operations. Ross and Fordham prevent his crimes in Blackwater while Van der Linde gang turnout Nastas and Professor Harold MacDougal of Yale try to convince the Native Americans to betray Dutch. This culminates with Marston, the Bureau, and the US Army assault Cochinay, Dutch's hideout. John then chases Dutch through a cave system that eventually leads onto a cliff. Confronted and nowhere to go, Dutch then says he was only fighting for what he believed in and that even after his death, the government will only find another individual to hunt down to \"justify their wages\". Dutch then steps off the cliff, committing suicide. With his old gang dead, John's family is returned to his ranch on Beecher's Hope, and is let go of the law's affairs.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"And The Truth Will Set You Free\")</ref>\n\nJohn returns to find his ranch in poor condition (due to the fact it was left in the care of a former gang member, a drunk named Uncle).<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"The Outlaw's Return\")</ref> John begins to live as he always wanted: taking care of his ranch and family. John grows a stronger bond with his son Jack and his wife Abigail. John teaches Jack good morality and mannerisms; John does not want Jack to kill needlessly and live like an outlaw in the future. The days on his ranch are more or less peaceful, until one day, when Uncle spots US army soldiers riding to the ranch; Edgar Ross, believing John to be the last member of the Van der Linde gang that must be killed, reneges on his promise and assaults John's ranch. John, Jack, and Uncle all bear arms and defend themselves; Uncle, however, is shot and killed. John defends his family as they flee to the barn on his ranch. There, he shares a final moment with Abigail and Jack; he instructs them to ride away and escape on horseback. They do so, and John, still in the barn, peers through the doors to see a line of soldiers, all ready to fire. He pushes open the doors and draws his gun, taking down as many soldiers as he can before they open fire. John is killed after a short struggle. Abigail and Jack return after the soldiers and Ross leave the ranch, and mourn over John's body. John's body is buried on a hillside at his ranch.<ref>[[#game|''Red Dead Redemption'']] (Mission: \"The Last Enemy That Shall Be Destroyed\")</ref>\n\nIn 1914, three years after John's death and shortly after Abigail's death, Jack, now 19 years old, decides to avenge his father. Jack manages to track down a retired Edgar Ross; the two duel, with Jack emerging victorious.\n\n===''Undead Nightmare''===\nIn ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', a [[canon (fiction)|non-canonical]], [[zombie apocalypse]]-themed [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate reality]], John finds that the world is plagued by a [[virus]] that brings the dead back to life with a taste for flesh. After killing an undead Uncle and tying up the infected Jack and Abigail, John rides to Blackwater, in search for a doctor. But he finds the town seemingly deserted, meeting Harold MacDougal, who had come back from Yale for \"another round of research\". Shortly afterwards, he is attacked by the undead Nastas and is also turned into a zombie. John purges Blackwater from the Undead and learns that the plague might be the fault of either Nigel West Dickens, Seth Briars, or the Mexicans. After visiting both men, John finds that neither has an idea what caused the virus and the only lead left is Mexico, which is rumored to be in better condition than America. Acquiring an army uniform, John heads to Mexico, only to find that the country is in even worse state. He learns from a nun that Abraham Reyes might be responsible and John heads there. He kills the zombified Reyes and finds a girl, who reveals that the reason for the virus is that Reyes had desecrated several catacombs beneath the government building, and had stolen an ancient [[Aztec]] mask, unbalancing order and unleashing the undead. John and the girl head down to the tombs and return the mask. John returns home to find that his family has been cured. Months later, after his death, John rises from his grave, as Seth has stolen the mask and once again caused the dead to rise. But John, being buried with [[holy water]], is a [[Revenants in fiction|revenant]] who still retains his soul and his capabilities to use weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption/2018/10/25/18022724/red-dead-redemption-undead-nightmare|title=Red Dead Redemption\u2019s Undead Nightmare was more than a trendy zombie game|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/the-good-and-bad-of-red-dead-redemptions-multiplayer-1829494342|title=The Good And Bad Of Red Dead Redemption's Multiplayer|first=Zack|last=Zwiezen|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Other appearances==\nIn ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'', the online mode of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', players can choose what their character is to look like by selecting between different parents; John is one of the special parents available, meaning that players can select John so that their character has a level of resemblance to him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51257/more-details-and-screens-from-the-grand-theft-auto-v-special-and.html |title=More Details and Screens from the Grand Theft Auto V Special and Collector's Edition Digital Content |author=R* Q |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=26 August 2013 |accessdate=3 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51422/some-more-details-on-grand-theft-auto-online.html |title=Some More Details on Grand Theft Auto Online |author=R* A |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=23 September 2013 |accessdate=3 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMarston's hat appears as an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in ''[[L.A.
