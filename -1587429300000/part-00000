In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had intentionally assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee investigation from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019. The lawsuit was settled on April 9, 2020, with the perpetrators fined several million yen and banned from future events related to the [[AKB48 Group]].\n\n==Incident==\n\nOn January 8, 2019, Maho Yamaguchi alleged in her [[SHOWROOM (streaming service)|Showroom]] live stream and Twitter that on December 8, 2018, two men (identified by press as two fans, one unemployed and the other an university student, both 25-year old<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html\n | title=\uff2e\uff27\uff34\u5c71\u53e3\u3055\u3093 \u3001\u75372\u4eba\u304b\u3089\u66b4\u884c | language=ja | work=[[Niigata Nippo]] | date=2019-01-10| url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513064058/https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html | archivedate=2019-05-13}}</ref>) after hiding in an apartment on the other side which was previously occupied by another member, had tried to break into her personal apartment as she was entering her apartment after prying open her door.

In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had intentionally assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee investigation from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019.
