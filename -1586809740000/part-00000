It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's \nsubjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>\n\n==Pius' internal administration==\nPius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\n[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]\nA unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>\n\n=== Education ===\nLiberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>\n\n=== Social life ===\nThere was one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L\u2019Osservatore Romano]], which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]\nPius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements, including the existing marble floors and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factory for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>\n\nGreat efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discoveries of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>\n[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]\n\n=== Protestants and Jews ===\n{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}\nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time. At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>\n\nIn 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\".<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls to return the child to his parents, from [[The Times|''The Times'']], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont,<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> were politely rejected.\n\n==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==\n\n===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.\n\n===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===\nIn the years that followed, Italian nationalists \u2013 both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution \u2013 saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia, playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.\n\n===Second Italian War of Independence===\n[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]\nAfter the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]]. The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope, following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].\n\n===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.

The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>\n\n==Pius' internal administration==\nPius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\n[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]\nA unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>\n\n=== Education ===\nLiberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>\n\n=== Social life ===\nThere was one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L\u2019Osservatore Romano]], which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]\nPius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements, including the existing marble floors and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factory for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>\n\nGreat efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discoveries of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>\n[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]\n\n=== Protestants and Jews ===\n{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}\nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time. At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>\n\nIn 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\".<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls to return the child to his parents, from [[The Times|''The Times'']], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont,<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> were politely rejected.\n\n==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==\n\n===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.\n\n===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===\nIn the years that followed, Italian nationalists \u2014 both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution \u2014 saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.\n\n===Second Italian War of Independence===\n[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]\nAfter the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].\n\n===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eForeign relations and effects of Italian unification:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States_under_Pope_Pius_IX"}

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the common borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]].

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v.

Development began in 1967, in response to requests from American dealers for products to sell in the motorcycle off-season. Takeuchi considered many variations before settling on a three-wheeled design with low-pressure ballon tires, driven by an enlarged [[Honda ST70]] engine, through a 4 Speed Dual-Range Semi automatic clutched transmission. <ref>{{cite web|author=ATC90.com |url= http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html |title=ATC90-History|website=ATC90.tripod.com|date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==1st Generation US90 (1970-1973)==\n\nThe Initial US90 was offered at $595 in 1970, and featured an 89cc engine producing 7hp.
