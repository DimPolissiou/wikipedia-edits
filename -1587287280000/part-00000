{"title_page": "Running back", "text_new": "{{other uses|Running back (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|Position in American and Canadian football}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[File:Football-Formation-RB.svg|thumb|The running back playing halfback in a typical [[I formation]].]]\n\nA '''running back''' ('''RB''') is a member of the [[offensive backfield]] in [[gridiron football]]. The primary roles of a running back are to receive [[American football plays#Offensive Plays|handoffs]] from the [[quarterback]] to [[Rush (American football)#Offense|rush]] the ball,\nand [[Blocking (American football)|block]].<ref>http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/what-the-running-backs-do-in-a-football-game.html</ref>  There are usually one or two running backs on the field for a given play, depending on the offensive formation. A running back may be a [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] (in certain contexts also referred to as a [[Running back#Halfback/tailback|tailback]]), a [[wingback (American football)|wingback]] or a [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]]. A running back will sometimes be called a \"'''feature back'''\" if he is the team's starting running back.\n\n==Halfback/tailback==\n{{Main|Halfback (American football)}}\n[[File:USMC Running back.jpg|thumb|A running back turns up the field in an attempt to reach the [[end zone]].]]\nThe halfback (HB) or tailback (TB) position is responsible for carrying the ball on the majority of running plays, and may frequently be used as a receiver on short passing plays.\n\nIn the modern game, an effective halfback must have a blend of both quickness and [[agility]] as a runner, as well as sure hands and good vision up-field as a receiver. Quarterbacks depend on halfbacks as a safety valve receiver when primary targets downfield are covered or when they are under pressure. Occasionally, halfbacks line up as additional [[wide receiver]]s.\n\nWhen not serving either of these functions, the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking, either to protect the [[quarterback]] or another player carrying the football. If a team uses a [[Wildcat formation]], often the halfback is the one who receives the snap directly instead of the quarterback. As a trick play, running backs are occasionally used to pass the ball on a [[halfback option play]] or [[halfback pass]].\n\nThe difference between halfback and tailback is the position of the player in the team's offensive formation. In historical formations, the halfback lined up approximately halfway between the line of scrimmage and the fullback (similarly, quarterbacks lined up a quarter of the distance between the line of scrimmage and the fullback). Because the halfback is usually the team's main ball carrier (while the fullback is primarily a blocker), modern offensive formations have positioned the halfback behind the fullback (at the \"tail end\" of the formation), to take advantage of the fullback's blocking abilities. As a result, some systems or playbooks will call for a tailback as opposed to a halfback.\n\nIn Canadian football, the term tailback is often used interchangeably with running back, while the use of the term halfback is often exclusively reserved for the [[defensive halfback]], which refers to the defensive back halfway between the linebackers and the cornerbacks.\n\n==Fullback==\n{{Main|Fullback (American football)}}\n[[File:John Riggins Super Bowl XVII TD Run.jpg|thumb|150px|John Riggins]]\nIn most modern college and professional football schemes, [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]]s (FB) carry the ball infrequently, instead using their stronger physiques as primary \"lead blockers.\" On most running plays, the fullback leads the halfback, attempting to block potential tacklers before they reach the ball carrier.\n\nWhen fullbacks are called upon to carry the ball, the situation typically calls for gaining a short amount of yardage, as the fullback can use his bulkiness to avoid being tackled early. Fullbacks are sometimes receivers for passing plays, although most plays call for the fullback to block any defensive players that make it past the offensive line, a skill referred to as [[Blitz (gridiron football)|\"blitz pickup\"]]. Fullbacks are technically running backs, but today the term \"running back\" is usually used in referring to the halfback or tailback. Although modern fullbacks are rarely used as ball carriers, in previous offensive schemes fullbacks would be the designated ball carriers.\n\nIn high school football, where player sizes vary greatly, fullbacks are still frequently used as ball carriers. In high school and college offenses, the [[triple option]] scheme uses the fullback as a primary ball carrier. The fullback plays a unique role by establishing an inside running threat on every play. College teams such as [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] and [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] have employed the triple option scheme.\n\nWhile in years past the fullback lined up on the field for almost every offensive play, teams often opt to replace the fullback with an additional [[wide receiver]] or a [[tight end]] in modern football. Fullbacks in the [[National Football League]] today rarely carry or catch the ball since they are used almost exclusively as blockers. Fullbacks are also still used occasionally as rushers on plays when a short gain is needed for a first-down or touchdown or to surprise the defense since they are usually not expecting a full back to run or catch the ball. [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] members [[Jim Brown]], [[Marion Motley]], [[Franco Harris]], [[John Riggins]], and [[Larry Csonka]] were fullbacks.\n\n==Characteristics of a running back==\n\n===Height and weight===\n[[File:Darren Sproles 2014.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Darren Sproles]], a \"scat back\"]]\nThere is a diversity in those who play at the running back position. At one extreme are smaller (5'4\"\u20135'10\"), shiftier players. These quick, agile, and elusive running backs are often called \"scat backs\" because their low center of gravity and maneuverability allow them to dodge tacklers. Running backs known for their elusiveness include [[Red Grange]], [[Hugh McElhenny]], [[Gale Sayers]], and [[Barry Sanders]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 most elusive runners in NFL history|url=http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork/story/09000d5d8087474a/article/top-10-most-elusive-runners-in-nfl-history|website=NFL.com|publisher=National Football League|accessdate=October 14, 2016|date=May 28, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAt the other extreme are \"power backs:\" bigger, stronger players who can break through tackles using brute strength and raw power. They are usually slower runners compared to other backs, and typically run straight ahead (or \"North-and-South\" in football terminology) rather than dodging to the outside edges of the playing field. Hall of Famers [[Earl Campbell]], [[Bronko Nagurski]], [[John Riggins]], and [[Larry Csonka]], as well as NFL all-time leading rusher [[Emmitt Smith]], were considered power running backs.\n\nMore recently the NFL has turned to running backs who combine those traits such as Atlanta Falcons' Todd Gurley, Dallas Cowboys\u2019 All-Pro Ezekiel Elliott, and New York Giants\u2019 Saquon Barkley. These backs combine elusiveness with power and patience as well as receiving ability and blocking to become all around, three-down backs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Chris|title=Top 25 Power Running Backs Of All Time|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2013/03/05/top-25-power-running-backs|website=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=October 14, 2016|date=March 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Receiving ability===\nOver the years, NFL running backs have been used as receivers out of the backfield. On passing plays, a running back will often run a \"safe route,\" such as a hook or a flat route, that gives a quarterback a target when all other receivers are covered or when the quarterback feels pressured. Hall of Famer [[Lenny Moore]] was a halfback who played primarily as a pass receiver.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lenny Moore Bio|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/players/lenny-moore/biography/|website=profootballhof.com|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=October 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome teams have a specialist \"third down back\", who is skilled at catching passes or better at pass blocking and \"picking up the blitz,\" and thus is often put in the game on third down and long. It can also be used to fool the defense by making them think it is being put into the game for a pass play, when the play is actually a run. [[James White (running back)|James White]] of the [[New England Patriots]] is used as a [[Running back#Receiving ability|third-down back]], or as an extra [[wide receiver]].  His receiving statistics exceed his rushing statistics, with 2,164 yards and 19 touchdowns on 248 receptions, compared to just 856 yards and 7 touchdowns on only 207 carries.\n\n===Blocking===\nRunning backs are also required to help the offensive line in passing situations, and, in the case of the fullback, running plays. Running backs will often block blitzing linebackers or safeties on passing plays when the offensive line is occupied with the defensive linemen. On running plays, the fullback will often attempt to create a hole in the offensive line for the running back to run through. Effective blocking backs are usually key components for a running back's success. On passing plays, a running back will stay back to help block and pick up the blitz\n\n===Goal line backs===\nMany teams also have a running back designated as a \"goal line back\" or \"short yardage specialist\". This running back comes into the game in short yardage situations when the offense needs only a little bit of yardage to get a first down or a touchdown. Normally when an offense gets inside the 5-yard line it sends in its goal line formation, which usually includes eight blockers, a quarterback, a running back, and a fullback. The closer it is to the goal line the more likely it is to use this formation. If a certain running back is used often near the goal line he may be called the \"goal line back.\" Short yardage and goal line backs often are power backs who are not prone to [[fumble|fumbling]], who muscle through or push a large mass of defenders to get the first down or touchdown.\n\n===As kick and punt returners===\nRunning backs are sometimes called upon to return [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]]s and [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]]s, a role usually filled by [[wide receiver]]s and [[defensive back]]s, such as cornerbacks, who are generally among the fastest players on the team. A running back, [[Brian Mitchell (running back)|Brian Mitchell]], currently holds the NFL records for career kickoff return yards (14,014 yards) and career punt return yards (4,999 yards).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://football.about.com/cs/football101/a/positionoff.htm Football 101: Basic Football positions]\n\n{{American football positions}}\n\n[[Category:American football positions]]\n[[Category:American football running backs| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Position in American and Canadian football}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{other uses|Running back (disambiguation)}}\n\n[[File:Football-Formation-RB.svg|thumb|The running back playing halfback in a typical [[I formation]].]]\n\nA '''running back''' ('''RB''') is a member of the [[offensive backfield]] in [[gridiron football]].

Still \"stuck\" in the midwest and determined to escape what she felt was a \"cultural desert\", she enlisted in the [[Women's Army Corps]] for two years. After the period was over, she was told that if she remained in the Corps, she could be sent to the place of her choice, anywhere in the world, so she re-enlisted and went to Japan. While there, she visited museums, learned about oriental art and met Japanese artists, calling the time a \"fabulous experience\".<ref name=\"evenews\" />\n\n== Career ==\nAll the while, her goal had been to get to New York, which she finally accomplished. She got a job at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] after working briefly at [[Time-Life]], but saw no future for herself, so in the mid-1960s, when [[Larry Aldrich]] offered her the job of director at his new museum in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]], she jumped at the offer.

Typically, a student's athletic eligibility in a given sport is four seasons, aligning with the four years of academic classes typically required to earn a [[bachelor's degree]] at an American college or university. However, in a '''redshirt year''', [[student athlete]]s may attend classes at the college or university, practice with an athletic team, and \"suit up\" (wear a team uniform) for play \u2013 but they may compete in only a limited number of games, (see \"[[#Use of status|Use of status]]\" section). Using this mechanism, a student athlete has at most five academic years to use the four years of eligibility, thus becoming what is termed a [[Super senior|fifth-year senior]].\n\n==Etymology and origin==\nAccording to ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' and ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged]]'', the term ''redshirt'' comes from the red [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] commonly worn by such a player in practice [[Line of scrimmage|scrimmage]]s against the regulars.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of REDSHIRT|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/redshirt|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of the term ''redshirt'' was likely from [[Warren Alfson]] of the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|University of Nebraska]] who, in 1937, asked to practice but not play and wore a Nebraska red shirt without a number. The term is used as a [[verb]], [[noun]], and [[adjective]]. For example, a coach may choose to redshirt a player who is then referred to as a redshirt, and a redshirt [[freshman]] refers to an athlete in the first year of participation, after a redshirt non-participatory year.\n\n==Reasons==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2018}}\nStudent athletes become redshirts for many reasons. One example is that the student athlete may not be ready to balance the demands of both academic and athletic requirements. Redshirting provides the opportunity, with tutoring, to take some classes and become accustomed to the academic rigors demanded of them. They may also redshirt to undergo a year of practice with a team prior to participating in competition. In American [[college football]], a student athlete may redshirt to work towards increasing size, strength, and stamina; all desirable assets for many positions, as the current and post-redshirt years coincide with the final phases of physical maturity. Players may also redshirt to learn the team playbook, as many college teams run more complex formations and executions in comparison to high school teams.\n\nAthletes may be asked to redshirt if they would have little or no opportunity to play as an academic freshman. This is a common occurrence in many sports where there is already an established upperclassman player in a position, or too much depth at the position the freshman in question plans to play. The coaching staff may also want to use the player as a starter later in their career so that they may play for the full four years instead of three.\n\nA special case involves the eligibility of a player who loses the majority of a season to injury, known as a '''medical redshirt'''. A '''hardship waiver''' may be granted to those athletes who sustain a major injury while appearing in less than 30% of team competitions and have not participated after the midpoint of a season. For the purposes of eligibility, players granted such a waiver are treated as though they did not compete in that season.\n\nOn rare occasions, players may be allowed to play in a sixth year of college if they suffered a serious injury that kept them from competing for more than one season. Former [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] [[quarterback]] [[Jason White (American football)|Jason White]] is perhaps the best known example of this; White had redshirted his first year, then subsequently [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|tore]] the [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] in both knees, forcing him to miss nearly two years of eligible play time. Another recent example is former [[Houston Cougars football|Houston Cougars]] quarterback [[Case Keenum]]. He redshirted his freshman year of 2006, and subsequently tore an ACL three games into the 2010 season, which would have otherwise been his final year of eligibility.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term '''redshirt freshman''' indicates an academic [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] who is in their first season of athletic participation. A redshirt freshman is distinguished from a true [[Freshman#United States|freshman]]: a student who is in their first year both academically and athletically. A redshirt freshman may have practiced with the team during the prior season. The term '''redshirt sophomore''' is also commonly used to indicate an academic [[Junior (education)|junior]] who is in the second season of athletic participation. After the second athletic year, the term redshirt is rarely used; the terms '''fourth-year junior''' and '''fifth-year [[Senior (education)|senior]]''' are used instead.\n\nIn 2016, a new status could be applied to prospective student athletes, dubbed an '''academic redshirt'''. That year, the NCAA started enforcing new, stricter admissions requirements for incoming athletic freshmen. Under these new requirements, a student athlete who meets a school's own academic admission requirements but does not meet the NCAA requirement of a 2.3 GPA across four years, may enter school as an academic redshirt. This student can receive an athletic scholarship and practice with the team, but may not participate in competition. An academic redshirt does not lose a year of eligibility, and may later take an injury redshirt if needed. Finally, as long as an academic redshirt completes nine academic credit hours in their first semester they may then compete in their second year free of restrictions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/7885522/new-incoming-eligibility-standards-create-term |title=New eligibility standards on the way: Toughest initial requirements ever enacted start with Class of 2016 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=May 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Other colors==\nAthletes may also use a \"grayshirt\" year, in which they attend school as neither a full-time student nor the recipient of a scholarship. They are an unofficial member of the team and do not participate in practices, games, or receive [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial assistance]] from the athletic department. Typically, grayshirts are players who are injured right before college and require an entire year to recuperate. Rather than waste the redshirt, the player can attend school as a part-time student and join the team later. This is also used by players with religious or military obligations that keep them out of school for a full academic year.\n\n\"Blueshirt\" athletes are those that the [[NCAA]] does not classify as a \"recruited student-athlete\". They have never made an official visit to the school, met with the school's athletic employees, had more than one phone call with them, or received a scholarship offer. Such athletes are [[walk-on (sports)|walk-on]]s, but can receive scholarships after enrolling; although they are immediately eligible to play, their scholarships count for the school's quota in the following year. The [[New Mexico State Aggies football]] program was the first to blueshirt in the early 2000s; other football programs include [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]].<ref name=\"mizell20140215\">{{cite news | url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-state-football-how-deionte-noel-went-from-texas-tech-commitment-to-osu-blueshirt/article/3934197/ | title=How Deionte Noel went from Texas Tech commitment to OSU 'blueshirt' | work=The Oklahoman | date=February 15, 2014 | accessdate=February 16, 2014 | author=Mizell, Gina}}</ref>\n\nThere also exists a [[Blackshirts (American football)|\"blackshirt\"]] which is unique to [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska football]], where the term redshirt likely originated. This is a tradition, generally denoting a starter or otherwise key contributor on Nebraska's defense, and is not related to eligibility.\n\n==Use of status==\nWhile the redshirt status may be conferred by a coach at the beginning of the year, it is not confirmed until the end of the season, and more specifically, it does not rule a player ineligible in advance to participate in the season. If a player shows great talent, or there are injuries on the team, the coach may remove the redshirt status and allow the player to participate in competition for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe first athlete known to extend his eligibility in the modern era of redshirting was [[Warren Alfson]] of the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|University of Nebraska]] in 1937.<ref name=\"Warren\">{{cite news|title=Warren Alfson|url=http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=944901|accessdate=February 4, 2016|publisher=huskers.com}}</ref> Alfson requested that he be allowed to sit out his sophomore season due to the number of experienced players ahead of him. In addition, he had not started college until several years after graduating from high school, and thus felt he needed more preparation. The year off greatly benefited him; Alfson was All-[[Big Eight Conference|Big Six Conference]] in 1939 and an [[All-American]] [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guard]] in 1940.\n\nIn January 2017, the trade association for college football coaches, the [[American Football Coaches Association]], proposed a change to that sport's eligibility rules that maintains the current model of four years of play in five years, but significantly changes the redshirt rule. Under the proposal, medical redshirts would be eliminated, but redshirt status would not be lost unless a player participated in more than four games in a season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/new-redshirt-proposal-would-allow-athletes-to-play-four-games-regardless-of-injury/ |title=New redshirt proposal would allow athletes to play four games, regardless of injury |first1=Ben |last1=Kercheval |first2=Dennis |last2=Dodd |website=[[CBSSports.com]] |date=January 11, 2017 |accessdate=December 31, 2017}}</ref> The proposal, which was unanimously passed by the AFCA subcommittees for all three NCAA divisions,<ref name=Sullivan>{{cite web|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/2017/12/30/college-football-can-benefit-revised-redshirt-rule-tim-sullivan/987732001/ |title=College football can benefit from a revised redshirt rule |first=Tim |last=Sullivan |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |location=[[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]] |date=December 31, 2017 |accessdate=December 31, 2017}}</ref> was approved by the NCAA Division I Council in June 2018, taking effect with the 2018 college football season.<ref name=Dellenger>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2018/06/13/ncaa-redshirt-rule-change-eligibility-reaction |title=The NCAA's Redshirt Rule Change Is a Major Win for Both Coaches and Players |first=Ross |last=Dellenger |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=June 13, 2018 |accessdate=July 27, 2018}}</ref> The original proposal was to have been retroactive, meaning that players with athletic eligibility remaining who had played in four or fewer games in a given season would have effectively received one extra season of eligibility,<ref name=Sullivan/> but the final passed proposal was not retroactive.<ref name=Dellenger/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/NCAA/Legislation+and+Governance/Eligibility+and+Recruiting/Faqs/eligibility_seasons.html NCAA Frequently-Asked Questions on Redshirts, Age Limits, and Graduate Participation].

Penn State won 9\u20130, which was nine goals to none. At the time, this was really a game of \"American rugby.\" The father of American football, Walter Camp, did not develop the \"scrimmage\", the \"first down\" and the \"gridiron\" (yard markings) until 1882. Although this game was reported in two State College newspapers and the ''Mirror'' (University of Lewisburg campus newspaper), Bucknell denies that this game ever happened. Penn State did not field teams from 1882 through 1886. Penn State played its first season in 1887,<ref name=\"nationalchamps.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalchamps.net/NCAA/database/pennstate_database.htm|title=Penn State Football History Database|work=nationalchamps.net}}</ref> but had no head coach for their first five years, from 1887\u20131891.<ref name=\"nationalchamps.net\"/> The teams played its home games on the [[Old Main (Pennsylvania State University)|Old Main]] lawn on campus in [[State College, Pennsylvania]]. They compiled a 12\u20138\u20131 record in these seasons, playing as an independent from 1887\u20131890. In 1891, the [[Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association]] (PIFA) was formed. It consisted of Bucknell (University of Lewisburg), Dickinson, Franklin & Marshall, Haverford, Penn State and Swarthmore. Lafayette and Lehigh were excluded because it was felt they would dominate the Association. Penn State won the championship with a 4\u20131\u20130 record. Bucknell's record was 3\u20131\u20131 (losing to Franklin & Marshall and tying Dickinson).

Penn State won the first four meetings of the series, which were held between 1912 and 1964. Then Ohio State won in 1975 in a game held in Columbus, Ohio and again in 1976 during the first ever matchup between the two teams in State College, Pennsylvania. Penn State and Ohio State would meet again in 1980 in their first and only postseason bowl, the 1980 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State won. After the Fiesta Bowl, the two teams would not meet again until Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993. Since then, the Nittany Lions and Buckeyes have played each other annually.

However, the one-sided record belies what was often a competitive matchup until its final years. While Maryland only compiled one win and one tie, numerous games were narrowly lost by missed [[Field goal (football)|field goals]] and [[Turnover (football)|turnovers]]. In 1975, a field goal attempt by kicker Mike Sochko hit the upright with under a minute left, and Maryland lost 15\u201313. Ten years later, the Terps missed three field goals to eventually lose 20\u201318. After the Nittany Lions' move to the Big Ten Conference in 1993, the series was cancelled. However, Maryland ended up joining the Big Ten as well, in 2014, reinstating the rivalry after more than 2 decades of being dormant. Maryland would win the first matchup by a point (20\u201319) after infamously declining to shake hands with Penn State captains at midfield during the coin toss at Beaver Stadium.\n\nThe second meeting as conference foes would be played in Baltimore at [[M&T Bank Stadium]] and would again be decided by a point, this time a Penn State win 31\u201330. The last four matchups (2016\u20132019), all victories for Penn State have seen the Nittany Lions outscore the Terrapins by a combined score of 201\u201320.

This series has been dominated by the Nittany Lions who lead the series 48\u20139\u20132.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/penn-state/vs/west-virginia|title=Winsipedia - Penn State Nittany Lions vs. West Virginia Mountaineers football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref>\n\n===Historic Rivalries===\n\n==== Syracuse ====\n{{main|Penn State\u2013Syracuse football rivalry}}\nThe rivalry started in 1922, when Syracuse fought Penn State to a scoreless tie. But it was during the 1950s and 1960s that the rivalry intensified, as it enjoyed a competitive and often controversial string of contests. Syracuse football was led by [[Ben Schwartzwalder]], and Penn State by [[Rip Engle]], then [[Joe Paterno]]. From [[1950 college football season|1950]] to [[1970 NCAA University Division football season|1970]], Syracuse won 11 games to Penn State's 10.\n\nAfter Schwartzwalder retired in [[1973 NCAA Division I football season|1973]], Syracuse floundered. Penn State won 16 straight from [[1971 NCAA University Division football season|1971]] to [[1986 NCAA Division I-A football season|1986]]. Conference realignment and scheduling disagreements also dampened the intensity of the rivalry. Penn State fans and players increasingly turned their attention to the [[Penn State\u2013Pittsburgh football rivalry|rivalry]] with [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]].\n\nIn [[1987 NCAA Division I-A football season|1987]], Coach [[Dick MacPherson]] finally led Syracuse to a resounding 48\u201321 victory over the Nittany Lions in the [[Carrier Dome]]. Syracuse won again the following year in [[Beaver Stadium|Happy Valley]] but lost the last two games before the series was suspended in [[1991 NCAA Division I-A football season|1991]]. The rivalry has since been renewed three times since the series suspension \u2014 in 2008, 2009, and 2013. The Nittany Lions won all three of these contests. Penn State leads the series 43\u201323\u20135 with the most recent game played in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/penn-state/vs/syracuse|title=Winsipedia - Penn State Nittany Lions vs. Syracuse Orange football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref>\n\n==== Alabama ====\n{{main|Alabama\u2013Penn State football rivalry}}\nThough the Crimson Tide are not as much of a traditional opponent for the Nittany Lions, the two teams are still often considered among the best in the country, claim a combined 18 national titles, and have met in a bowl game three times. The series began on December 19, 1959 in that year's edition of the [[1959 Liberty Bowl|Liberty Bowl]], a 7\u20130 win for #12 Penn State. Sixteen years later, the Nittany Lions and Crimson Tide met in the 1975 Sugar Bowl, resulting in a 13\u20136 Tide victory in New Orleans. Perhaps the most notable game between these two teams came four years later, in a 1979 Sugar Bowl rematch, resulting in another Alabama victory. The rivalry was intensified during the 1980s, when the Lions and Tide met in 10 consecutive seasons, all during regular season play. After this time, the rivalry went dormant for two decades before being renewed for a 2-game home-and-home series in 2010 and 2011.

In recent years, Penn State students have donned white clothes, paint - anything white - to show their solidarity and support for the Nittany Lions. Forming a mass of bouncing and infectious enthusiasm, the students have \"Whited Out\" Beaver Stadium, the Bryce Jordan Center and other sports venues, making them some of the noisiest and most intimidating stadiums in America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/259947-a-brief-history-of-penn-state-whiteouts|title=A Brief History of the Penn State Whiteout|last=Ferguson|first=Alex|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nBeano Cook of ESPN says, \"If you aren't impressed with the White Out, you're probably one of those people who think the moon landing was faked.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.psu.edu/story/184509/2008/08/16/nittany-lion-student-section-ranked-nations-best|title=Nittany Lion student section ranked nation's best {{!}} Penn State University|website=news.psu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\n===Nittanyville===\nOriginally named \"Paternoville,\" Nittanyville is a student camp out that occurs every week of a Penn State home football game. The students camp out to support the team and to acquire the best possible seats for the weekend's upcoming game, since seating is first-come, first serve for students. While the name \"Paternoville\" came about during Penn State's 2005 football season, students have long camped out for first row seats. Prior to 1993, the University distributed non-seat-specific tickets. Starting the same year Penn State football began competition in the Big Ten Conference, students were assigned seats on a first-come-first-serve basis, so that the first students to pass through \"Gate A\" at the south-east corner of the stadium would be assigned first row seats, and so on down the line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_75803a19-86de-5025-9e9d-2a1cb5da4a8b.html|title=Students adjust to assigned seating|last=Epstein|first=Brian|website=The Daily Collegian|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> Since then, students have camped out in small to massive numbers in order to guarantee themselves a rail-side seat (though the students hardly ever sit) for the most amazing of sports spectacles; a Penn State home football game.\n\nMany generations of campers have come and gone, but it wasn't until the 2005 season that the students had a name for their tent-city. In anticipation of the 2005 clash between #16 Penn State and #6 Ohio State, students began camping six days in advance of the game outside the gate so that they would get a first row seat for, arguably, the biggest game of the 2005 season for Penn State. On Tuesday of the week preceding the game, \"Paternoville\" first appeared. Credited with the naming, freshman Dan Clark and the other students camping with him created a banner reading \"Paternoville.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/sports/ncaafootball/25psu.html|title=Penn State Tent City Now Has Rule Book|last=Viera|first=Mark|date=2008-09-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe name stuck. On Wednesday morning, October 5, 2005, newspapers were already referring to the campsite as \"Paternoville.\" State-wide, regional, and even national media outlets began paying attention to the show in front of Gate A. Local businesses printed t-shirts up for the students, brought truckloads of food, and distributed various things like magazines and small footballs to keep the students occupied. Throughout the week, players, coaches, and many alumni and media personalities paid visits to Paternoville.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_166c7e20-cb29-5ac9-afbe-1c195f0b3368.html|title=Paterno, Spanier visit stadium camp|last=Yassin|first=Sirage|website=The Daily Collegian|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nOn Friday, ESPN's \"Cold Pizza\" morning show was broadcast from in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, across from the stadium, with some of the cast walking through Paternoville interviewing students and taping their activities, despite the constant drizzle. The next day, ESPN's College Gameday also was broadcast in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, hours before the showdown between the cross-border rivals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_28dd1a20-a408-544b-a67d-2481bb18e06f.html|title=ESPN's Cold Pizza to film at PSU|website=The Daily Collegian|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nBefore noon, the tents were packed away and hundreds of students began to line up for entry into the stadium. That night, in a historic match, the Nittany Lions upset the #6 ranked Buckeys 17-10 in front of a crowd of almost 110,000. The game being decided on a fumble by Ohio State quarterback and future Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith, caused by Penn State defensive end Tamba Hali and recovered by defensive tackle Scott Paxson. After the final whistle, the jubilant students rushed the field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=252810213|title=Ohio State vs. Penn State - Game Summary - October 8, 2005 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nThe Paternoville name continued after the game. Since the original \"Paternoville,\" two other games have garnered comparable camp-outs. They were the 2005 contest against the University of Wisconsin Badgers (Senior Day for the 2005 season),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.psu.edu/story/207233/2005/11/08/football-2005-year-review|title=Football 2005 year in review {{!}} Penn State University|website=news.psu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> and the 2006 contest against University of Michigan Wolverines. However, students camp out for every game, not just the \"big\" games. On average, about 10-15 tents appear for every game, while the number of tents for the 2005 Ohio State and Wisconsin games and the 2006 Michigan game exceeded 100.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lancasteronline.com/sports/psu-michigan-pick-your-subplot/article_e12f5c4b-3c6b-5d79-8b8e-28fc59f64466.html|title=PSU-Michigan: Pick your subplot|last=Freeman|first=Kevin|website=LancasterOnline|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the 2006 season, the University placed several markers around Beaver Stadium commemorating various traditions related to Penn State football. To the left of Gate A there is a marker for the Penn State \"student section\" and to the right of the gate there is a marker for \"Paternoville.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopsusports.com/news/2006/9/29/First_Phase_of_Beaver_Stadium_Enhancements_Complete.aspx|title=First Phase of Beaver Stadium Enhancements Complete|website=Penn State University Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nSince 2006, the practice of camping out has grown every year until 2009, when over 2,000 different students camped out for one or multiple games throughout the season. In 2011, the record was broken because of Penn State's high-powered home schedule, which included SEC powerhouse Alabama and new in-conference foe Nebraska, amongst other teams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackshoediaries.com/2012/7/16/3163713/paternoville-is-now-nittanyville|title=Paternoville Is Now Nittanyville|last=Vecellio|first=Dan|date=2012-07-16|website=Black Shoe Diaries|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2012, \"Paternoville\" officially became \"Nittanyville.\" As Coach Paterno was no longer the coach of Penn State's football team, the organization decided that since it was unlikely another coach would stay as long as Coach Paterno had, changing the name for each new coach would be impractical. However, aside from the name, nothing has changed and students will continue to support the team and camp out for the best seats long into the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_df06bef8-ed7a-515a-a83c-fd921ee25270.html|title='Paternoville' changes name to 'Nittanyville'|last=Gilbert|first=Tim|website=The Daily Collegian|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\n===Success with Honor===\nJoe Paterno was widely known for his \"grand experiment\" in which he challenged his players to be successful both on the field and in the classroom.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/paternos-grand-experiment-produced-perfection-38536635-012312|title=Paterno's Grand Experiment produced perfection|date=2012-01-23|work=FOX Sports|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2011, the Nittany Lion football team posted an 87% graduation rate, tied with Stanford for No. 10 overall among the nation's 120 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) institutions, above the national average of 67%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110211aaa.html |title=Penn State Football Tied For Best Graduation Success Rate Among BCS/AP Top 25 Teams|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=The Official Home of the Penn State Nittany Lions |date=November 2, 2011 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe June 2012 conviction of former assistant coach [[Jerry Sandusky]] on multiple counts of child sexual abuse marred the \"Success with Honor\" image.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/06/23/juror-sandusky-lacked-emotion-confirming-correct-verdict/#ixzz1zMjaPKhU |title=Juror: Sandusky lacked emotion, confirming correct verdict |publisher=Fox News |date= June 23, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> President Rodney Erickson, athletics director Dave Joyner, and head football coach Bill O'Brien, all of whom accepted their jobs in the wake of the scandal, have made statements in which they express commitment to maintaining integrity at the university and within the athletics programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackshoediaries.com/2012/7/23/3177470/erickson-joyner-obrien-release-statements |title=Erickson, Joyner, O'Brien Release Statements |publisher=Black Shoe Diaries |date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, a group of alumni and supporters established a non-profit organization [501(c)(3) and registered trademark] that will build upon the \"Success with Honor\" motto.

Penn State won 9\u20130, which was nine goals to none. At the time, this was really a game of \"American rugby.\" The father of American football, Walter Camp, did not develop the \"scrimmage\", the \"first down\" and the \"gridiron\" (yard markings) until 1882. Although this game was reported in two State College newspapers and the ''Mirror'' (University of Lewisburg campus newspaper), Bucknell denies that this game ever happened. Penn State did not field teams from 1882 through 1886. Penn State played its first season in 1887,<ref name=\"nationalchamps.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalchamps.net/NCAA/database/pennstate_database.htm|title=Penn State Football History Database|work=nationalchamps.net}}</ref> but had no head coach for their first five years, from 1887\u20131891.<ref name=\"nationalchamps.net\"/> The teams played its home games on the [[Old Main (Pennsylvania State University)|Old Main]] lawn on campus in [[State College, Pennsylvania]]. They compiled a 12\u20138\u20131 record in these seasons, playing as an independent from 1887\u20131890. In 1891, the [[Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association]] (PIFA) was formed. It consisted of Bucknell (University of Lewisburg), Dickinson, Franklin & Marshall, Haverford, Penn State and Swarthmore. Lafayette and Lehigh were excluded because it was felt they would dominate the Association. Penn State won the championship with a 4\u20131\u20130 record. Bucknell's record was 3\u20131\u20131 (losing to Franklin & Marshall and tying Dickinson). The Association was dissolved prior to the 1892 season.<ref name=\"nationalchamps.net\"/> \n\n[[File:George W Hoskins - Bucknell.jpg|thumb|George Hoskins, Penn State's first head football coach]]\n[[George W.

Penn State won the first four meetings of the series, which were held between 1912 and 1964. Then Ohio State won in 1975 in a game held in Columbus, Ohio and again in 1976 during the first ever matchup between the two teams in State College, Pennsylvania. Penn State and Ohio State would meet again in 1980 in their first and only postseason bowl, the 1980 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State won. After the Fiesta Bowl, the two teams would not meet again until Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993. Since then, the Nittany Lions and Buckeyes have played each other annually.  Ohio State leads the series 19\u201314 through the 2019 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/penn-state/vs/ohio-state|title=Winsipedia - Penn State Nittany Lions vs. Ohio State Buckeyes football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref>\n\n=== Maryland ===\n{{main|Maryland\u2013Penn State football rivalry}}\nPenn State and Maryland met in briefly interrupted stretches between 1917 and 1993, with a near-consecutive run played all but three years (1976, 1981, and 1983) between 1960 and 1993. However, the one-sided record belies what was often a competitive matchup until its final years. While Maryland only compiled one win and one tie, numerous games were narrowly lost by missed [[Field goal (football)|field goals]] and [[Turnover (football)|turnovers]]. In 1975, a field goal attempt by kicker Mike Sochko hit the upright with under a minute left, and Maryland lost 15\u201313. Ten years later, the Terps missed three field goals to eventually lose 20\u201318. After the Nittany Lions' move to the Big Ten Conference in 1993, the series was cancelled. However, Maryland ended up joining the Big Ten as well, in 2014, reinstating the rivalry after more than 2 decades of being dormant. Maryland would win the first matchup by a point (20\u201319) after infamously declining to shake hands with Penn State captains at midfield during the coin toss at Beaver Stadium. \n\nThe second meeting as conference foes would be played in Baltimore at [[M&T Bank Stadium]] and would again be decided by a point, this time a Penn State win 31\u201330. The last four matchups (2016\u20132019), all victories for Penn State have seen the Nittany Lions outscore the Terrapins by a combined score of 201\u201320.

This series has been dominated by the Nittany Lions who lead the series 48\u20139\u20132.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/penn-state/vs/west-virginia|title=Winsipedia - Penn State Nittany Lions vs. West Virginia Mountaineers football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref>\n\n===Historic Rivalries===\n\n==== Syracuse ====\n{{main|Penn State\u2013Syracuse football rivalry}}\nThe rivalry started in 1922, when Syracuse fought Penn State to a scoreless tie. But it was during the 1950s and 1960s that the rivalry intensified, as it enjoyed a competitive and often controversial string of contests. Syracuse football was led by [[Ben Schwartzwalder]], and Penn State by [[Rip Engle]], then [[Joe Paterno]]. From [[1950 college football season|1950]] to [[1970 NCAA University Division football season|1970]], Syracuse won 11 games to Penn State's 10. \n\nAfter Schwartzwalder retired in [[1973 NCAA Division I football season|1973]], Syracuse floundered. Penn State won 16 straight from [[1971 NCAA University Division football season|1971]] to [[1986 NCAA Division I-A football season|1986]]. Conference realignment and scheduling disagreements also dampened the intensity of the rivalry. Penn State fans and players increasingly turned their attention to the [[Penn State\u2013Pittsburgh football rivalry|rivalry]] with [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]].\n\nIn [[1987 NCAA Division I-A football season|1987]], Coach [[Dick MacPherson]] finally led Syracuse to a resounding 48\u201321 victory over the Nittany Lions in the [[Carrier Dome]]. Syracuse won again the following year in [[Beaver Stadium|Happy Valley]] but lost the last two games before the series was suspended in [[1991 NCAA Division I-A football season|1991]]. The rivalry has since been renewed three times since the series suspension \u2014 in 2008, 2009, and 2013. The Nittany Lions won all three of these contests. Penn State leads the series 43\u201323\u20135 with the most recent game played in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winsipedia.com/penn-state/vs/syracuse|title=Winsipedia - Penn State Nittany Lions vs. Syracuse Orange football series history|website=Winsipedia}}</ref>\n\n==== Alabama ====\n{{main|Alabama\u2013Penn State football rivalry}}\nThough the Crimson Tide are not as much of a traditional opponent for the Nittany Lions, the two teams are still often considered among the best in the country, claim a combined 18 national titles, and have met in a bowl game three times. The series began on December 19, 1959 in that year's edition of the [[1959 Liberty Bowl|Liberty Bowl]], a 7\u20130 win for #12 Penn State. Sixteen years later, the Nittany Lions and Crimson Tide met in the 1975 Sugar Bowl, resulting in a 13\u20136 Tide victory in New Orleans. Perhaps the most notable game between these two teams came four years later, in a 1979 Sugar Bowl rematch, resulting in another Alabama victory. The rivalry was intensified during the 1980s, when the Lions and Tide met in 10 consecutive seasons, all during regular season play. After this time, the rivalry went dormant for two decades before being renewed for a 2-game home-and-home series in 2010 and 2011.

In recent years, Penn State students have donned white clothes, paint - anything white - to show their solidarity and support for the Nittany Lions. Forming a mass of bouncing and infectious enthusiasm, the students have \"Whited Out\" Beaver Stadium, the Bryce Jordan Center and other sports venues, making them some of the noisiest and most intimidating stadiums in America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/259947-a-brief-history-of-penn-state-whiteouts|title=A Brief History of the Penn State Whiteout|last=Ferguson|first=Alex|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nBeano Cook of ESPN says, \"If you aren't impressed with the White Out, you're probably one of those people who think the moon landing was faked.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.psu.edu/story/184509/2008/08/16/nittany-lion-student-section-ranked-nations-best|title=Nittany Lion student section ranked nation's best {{!}} Penn State University|website=news.psu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\n===Nittanyville===\nOriginally named \"Paternoville,\" Nittanyville is a student camp out that occurs every week of a Penn State home football game. The students camp out to support the team and to acquire the best possible seats for the weekend's upcoming game, since seating is first-come, first serve for students. While the name \"Paternoville\" came about during Penn State's 2005 football season, students have long camped out for first row seats. Prior to 1993, the University distributed non-seat-specific tickets. Starting the same year Penn State football began competition in the Big Ten Conference, students were assigned seats on a first-come-first-serve basis, so that the first students to pass through \"Gate A\" at the south-east corner of the stadium would be assigned first row seats, and so on down the line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_75803a19-86de-5025-9e9d-2a1cb5da4a8b.html|title=Students adjust to assigned seating|last=Epstein|first=Brian|website=The Daily Collegian|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> Since then, students have camped out in small to massive numbers in order to guarantee themselves a rail-side seat (though the students hardly ever sit) for the most amazing of sports spectacles; a Penn State home football game.\n\nMany generations of campers have come and gone, but it wasn't until the 2005 season that the students had a name for their tent-city. In anticipation of the 2005 clash between #16 Penn State and #6 Ohio State, students began camping six days in advance of the game outside the gate so that they would get a first row seat for, arguably, the biggest game of the 2005 season for Penn State. On Tuesday of the week preceding the game, \"Paternoville\" first appeared. Credited with the naming, freshman Dan Clark and the other students camping with him created a banner reading \"Paternoville.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/sports/ncaafootball/25psu.html|title=Penn State Tent City Now Has Rule Book|last=Viera|first=Mark|date=2008-09-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe name stuck. On Wednesday morning, October 5th, 2005, newspapers were already referring to the campsite as \"Paternoville.\" State-wide, regional, and even national media outlets began paying attention to the show in front of Gate A. Local businesses printed t-shirts up for the students, brought truckloads of food, and distributed various things like magazines and small footballs to keep the students occupied. Throughout the week, players, coaches, and many alumni and media personalities paid visits to Paternoville.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_166c7e20-cb29-5ac9-afbe-1c195f0b3368.html|title=Paterno, Spanier visit stadium camp|last=Yassin|first=Sirage|website=The Daily Collegian|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nOn Friday, ESPN's \"Cold Pizza\" morning show was broadcast from in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, across from the stadium, with some of the cast walking through Paternoville interviewing students and taping their activities, despite the constant drizzle. The next day, ESPN's College Gameday also was broadcast in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, hours before the showdown between the cross-border rivals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_28dd1a20-a408-544b-a67d-2481bb18e06f.html|title=ESPN's Cold Pizza to film at PSU|website=The Daily Collegian|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nBefore noon, the tents were packed away and hundreds of students began to line up for entry into the stadium. That night, in a historic match, the Nittany Lions upset the #6 ranked Buckeys 17-10 in front of a crowd of almost 110,000. The game being decided on a fumble by Ohio State quarterback and future Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith, caused by Penn State defensive end Tamba Hali and recovered by defensive tackle Scott Paxson. After the final whistle, the jubilant students rushed the field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=252810213|title=Ohio State vs. Penn State - Game Summary - October 8, 2005 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nThe Paternoville name continued after the game. Since the original \"Paternoville,\" two other games have garnered comparable camp-outs. They were the 2005 contest against the University of Wisconsin Badgers (Senior Day for the 2005 season),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.psu.edu/story/207233/2005/11/08/football-2005-year-review|title=Football 2005 year in review {{!}} Penn State University|website=news.psu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> and the 2006 contest against University of Michigan Wolverines. However, students camp out for every game, not just the \"big\" games. On average, about 10-15 tents appear for every game, while the number of tents for the 2005 Ohio State and Wisconsin games and the 2006 Michigan game exceeded 100.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lancasteronline.com/sports/psu-michigan-pick-your-subplot/article_e12f5c4b-3c6b-5d79-8b8e-28fc59f64466.html|title=PSU-Michigan: Pick your subplot|last=Freeman|first=Kevin|website=LancasterOnline|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the 2006 season, the University placed several markers around Beaver Stadium commemorating various traditions related to Penn State football. To the left of Gate A there is a marker for the Penn State \"student section\" and to the right of the gate there is a marker for \"Paternoville.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopsusports.com/news/2006/9/29/First_Phase_of_Beaver_Stadium_Enhancements_Complete.aspx|title=First Phase of Beaver Stadium Enhancements Complete|website=Penn State University Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nSince 2006, the practice of camping out has grown every year until 2009, when over 2,000 different students camped out for one or multiple games throughout the season. In 2011, the record was broken because of Penn State's high-powered home schedule, which included SEC powerhouse Alabama and new in-conference foe Nebraska, amongst other teams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackshoediaries.com/2012/7/16/3163713/paternoville-is-now-nittanyville|title=Paternoville Is Now Nittanyville|last=Vecellio|first=Dan|date=2012-07-16|website=Black Shoe Diaries|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2012, \"Paternoville\" officially became \"Nittanyville.\" As Coach Paterno was no longer the coach of Penn State's football team, the organization decided that since it was unlikely another coach would stay as long as Coach Paterno had, changing the name for each new coach would be impractical. However, aside from the name, nothing has changed and students will continue to support the team and camp out for the best seats long into the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_df06bef8-ed7a-515a-a83c-fd921ee25270.html|title='Paternoville' changes name to 'Nittanyville'|last=Gilbert|first=Tim|website=The Daily Collegian|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\n===Success with Honor===\nJoe Paterno was widely known for his \"grand experiment\" in which he challenged his players to be successful both on the field and in the classroom.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/paternos-grand-experiment-produced-perfection-38536635-012312|title=Paterno's Grand Experiment produced perfection|date=2012-01-23|work=FOX Sports|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2011, the Nittany Lion football team posted an 87% graduation rate, tied with Stanford for No. 10 overall among the nation's 120 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) institutions, above the national average of 67%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110211aaa.html |title=Penn State Football Tied For Best Graduation Success Rate Among BCS/AP Top 25 Teams|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=The Official Home of the Penn State Nittany Lions |date=November 2, 2011 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe June 2012 conviction of former assistant coach [[Jerry Sandusky]] on multiple counts of child sexual abuse marred the \"Success with Honor\" image.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/06/23/juror-sandusky-lacked-emotion-confirming-correct-verdict/#ixzz1zMjaPKhU |title=Juror: Sandusky lacked emotion, confirming correct verdict |publisher=Fox News |date= June 23, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> President Rodney Erickson, athletics director Dave Joyner, and head football coach Bill O'Brien, all of whom accepted their jobs in the wake of the scandal, have made statements in which they express commitment to maintaining integrity at the university and within the athletics programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackshoediaries.com/2012/7/23/3177470/erickson-joyner-obrien-release-statements |title=Erickson, Joyner, O'Brien Release Statements |publisher=Black Shoe Diaries |date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, a group of alumni and supporters established a non-profit organization [501(c)(3) and registered trademark] that will build upon the \"Success with Honor\" motto.

His new wife is shown to be callous and selfish. The swordsman regrets leaving his more devoted and patient ex-wife.\n\nThe second wife is furious when she realizes that the swordsman not only married her to obtain her family's wealth, but also still longs for his old life in Kyoto with his ex-wife. When he is told to go into the chambers to reconcile with her, the swordsman refuses, stating his intent to return home and reconcile with his ex-wife. He points out his foolish behavior and poverty as the reasons why he reacted the way he did. The swordsman informs the lady-in-waiting to tell his 2nd wife that their marriage is over and she can return to her parents in shame.\n\nAfter a few years, the swordsman returns to his home to find it in disrepair. He reconciles with his ex-wife, who refuses to let him punish himself. She tells him that she understood that he only left her in order to bring income to their home. The two happily exchange wonderful stories about the past and the future until the swordsman falls asleep. He wakes up the following day only to discover he had been sleeping next to his ex-wife's rotted corpse. Rapidly aging, he escapes the house only to be attacked by his ex-wife\u2019s black hair.\n\n===The Woman of the Snow===\n{{nihongo|\"The Woman of the Snow\"|\u96ea\u5973|Yukionna}} is an adaptation from Hearn's ''[[Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things]]'' (1903).\n\nTwo woodcutters named Minokichi and Mosaku take refuge in a fisherman's hut during a snowstorm. Mosaku is killed by a [[Yuki-onna]].  When the Yukionna turns to Minokichi she remarks that he is a handsome boy and takes pity by sparing him because of his youth. The Yuki-onna warns him to never mention what happened or she will kill him.\n\nMinokichi returns home and never mentions that night.  One day while cutting wood he comes across Yuki, a beautiful young woman. She tells him that she is on her way to Edo, as she lost her family and has relatives there who can secure her a job as a lady-in-waiting. Minokichi offers to let her spend the night at his house with his mother. The mother takes a liking to Yuki and asks her to stay. She never leaves for Edo and Minokichi falls in love with her. The two marry and have children, living happily. The older women in the town are in awe over Yuki maintaining her youth even after having three children.\n\nOne night, Minokichi gives Yuki a set of sandals he has made.  She is stitching a kimono in the candlelight.  In the light, Minokichi recalls the Yuki-onna and see a resemblance between them.  He tells her about the strange encounter. It is then that Yuki reveals herself to be the Yuki-onna and a snowstorm comes over the home. Despite the fact he broke his word, she refrains from killing him because of their children. Yuki then leaves Minokichi with the children, warning him to treat them well or she will return and kill him. She disappears into the snowstorm, leaving Minokichi heartbroken.\n\n===Hoichi the Earless===\n{{nihongo|\"Hoichi the Earless\"|\u8033\u7121\u3057\u82b3\u4e00\u306e\u8a71|Miminashi H\u014dichi no Hanashi}} is also adapted from Hearn's ''Kwaidan'' (though it incorporates aspects of ''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'' that are mentioned, but never translated, in Hearn's book).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nHoichi is a young blind musician who plays the [[Biwa h\u014dshi|biwa hoshi]]. His specialty is singing the chant of [[The Tale of the Heike]] about the [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]] fought between the [[Taira clan|Taira]] and [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] clans during the last phase of the [[Genpei War]].  Hoichi is an attendant at a temple and is looked after the others there. One night he hears a sound and decides to play his instrument in the garden courtyard.  A spectral samurai appears and tells him that his lord wishes to have a performance at his house.  The samurai leads Hoichi to mysterious and ancient court.  Another attendant notices that he went missing for the night as his dinner was not touched. The samurai re-appears on the next night to take Hoichi and affirms that he has not told anyone.  Afterwards, the priest asks Hoichi why he goes out at night but Hoichi won't tell him.  One night, Hoichi leaves in a storm and his friends follow him and discover he has been going to a graveyard and reciting the Tale of Heike to the court of the [[Emperor Antoku|dead Emperor]].  Hoichi informs the court that it takes many nights to chant the entire epic.  They direct him to chant the final battle - the battle of Dan-no-ura.  His friends drag him home as he refuses to leave before his performance is completed.\n\nThe priest tell Hoichi he is in great danger and that this was a vast illusion from the spirit of the dead.  They tell Hoichi that if he obeys them again they will tear him to pieces.  Concerned for Hoichi\u2019s safety, a priest and his acolyte write the text of The Heart Sutra on his entire body including his face to make him invisible to the ghosts and instruct him to meditate. The samurai re-appears and calls out for Hoichi.  Hoichi does not answer.  Hoichi's ears are visible to the samurai as they forgot to write the text on his ears.  The samurai, wanting to bring back as much of Hoichi as possible, rips his ears off to show his lord his commands have been obeyed. \n\nThe next morning, the priest and the attendants see a trail of blood leading from the temple.  The priest and the acolyte realize their error and believe the ears were a trade for Hoichi's life.  They believe the spirits will now leave him alone.\n\nA local lord attend at the temple with a full retinue.  They have heard the story of Hoichi the earless and wish to hear him play his biwa.  \nHe is brought to court of the lord.  Hoichi says he will play to console the sorrowful spirits and allow them to rest.  \n\nThe narrator indicates than many wealthy noble person would come to the temple with large gifts of money and Hoichi-the-earless became a wealthy person.\n\n===In a Cup of Tea===\n{{nihongo|\"In a Cup of Tea\"|\u8336\u7897\u306e\u4e2d|Chawan no Naka}} is adapted from Hearn's ''Kott\u014d: Being Japanese Curios, with Sundry Cobwebs'' (1902).\n\nAnticipating a visit from his publisher, a writer relates an old tale of an attendant of Lord Nakagawa Sadono named Sekinai. While Lord Nakagawa is his way to make a New Year's visit, he halts with his train at a tea-house in [[Hakusan, Ishikawa|Hakusan]]. While the party is resting there, Sekinai sees the face of a strange man in a cup of tea. Despite being perturbed, he drinks the cup.\n\nLater, while Sekinai is guarding his Lord, the man whose face appeared in the tea reappears, calling himself Heinai Shikibu. Sekinai runs to tell the other attendants, but they laugh and tell him he is seeing things. Later that night at his own residence, Sekinai is visited by three ghostly attendants of Heinai Shikibu. He duels them and is nearly defeated, but the author notes the tale ends before things are resolved and suggests that he could write a complete ending, but prefers to leave the ending to the reader's imagination.\n\nThe publisher soon arrives and asks the Madame for the author, who is nowhere to be found. They both flee the scene in terror when they discover the author trapped inside a large jar of water.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Kurokami===\n\n* [[Michiyo Aratama]] as First wife\n* [[Misako Watanabe]] as Second Wife\n* [[Rentar\u014d Mikuni]] as Husband\n* [[Kenjiro Ishiyama]] as Father\n* [[Ranko Akagi]] as Mother\n\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Yuki-Onna===\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as Minokichi\n* [[Keiko Kishi]] as the Yuki-Onna \n* [[Y\u016bko Mochizuki]] as Minokichi's mother\n* [[Kin Sugai]] as Village woman\n* [[Noriko Sengoku]] as Village woman\n\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Miminashi H\u014dichi no Hanashi===\n* [[Katsuo Nakamura]] as Hoichi\n* [[Tetsur\u014d Tamba]] as Warrior\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Head priest\n* [[Yoichi Hayashi]] as [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]]\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Chawan no naka===\n* [[Haruko Sugimura]] as Madame\n* [[Osamu Takizawa]] as Author / Narrator\n* [[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]] as Publisher\n* [[Noboru Nakaya]] as Shikibu Heinai\n* [[Seiji Miyaguchi]] as Old man\n* [[Kei Sat\u014d]] as Ghost samurai\n\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 1964, [[Toho]] began a three-film deal with director [[Masaki Kobayashi]] that concluded with the production ''Kwaidan''.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=451}}\n\n==Release==\nThe [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] version of ''Kwaidan'' was released theatrically in Japan on January 6, 1965 where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=217}} The Japanese general release for ''Kwaidan'' began on February 27, 1965.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=218}} ''Kwaidan'' was reedited to 125 minutes in the United States for its theatrical release which eliminated the segment \"The Woman of the Snow\" after the film's Los Angeles premiere.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=217}} It was released in the United States on July 15, 1965 where it was distributed by [[Continental Distributing]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=217}} ''Kwaidan'' was re-released theatrically in Japan on November 29, 1982 in Japan as part of Toho's 50th anniversary.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=332}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=August 2015}}\nIn Japan the film won [[Yoko Mizuki]] the [[Kinema Junpo]] award for Best Screenplay.

The swordsman informs the lady-in-waiting to tell his 2nd wife that their marriage is over and she can return to her parents in shame.\n\nAfter a few years, the swordsman returns to his home to find it in disrepair. He reconciles with his ex-wife, who refuses to let him punish himself. She tells him that she understood that he only left her in order to bring income to their home. The two happily exchange wonderful stories about the past and the future until the swordsman falls asleep. He wakes up the following day only to discover he had been sleeping next to his ex-wife's rotted corpse. Rapidly aging, he escapes the house only to be attacked by his ex-wife\u2019s black hair.\n\n===The Woman of the Snow===\n{{nihongo|\"The Woman of the Snow\"|\u96ea\u5973|Yukionna}} is an adaptation from Hearn's ''[[Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things]]'' (1903).\n\nTwo woodcutters named Minokichi and Mosaku take refuge in a fisherman's hut during a snowstorm. Mosaku is killed by a [[Yuki-onna]].  When the Yukionna turns to Minokichi she remarks that he is a handsome boy and takes pity by sparing him because of his youth. The Yuki-onna warns him to never mention what happened or she will kill him.\n\nMinokichi returns home and never mentions that night.  One day while cutting wood he comes across Yuki, a beautiful young woman. She tells him that she is on her way to Edo, as she lost her family and has relatives there who can secure her a job as a lady-in-waiting. Minokichi offers to let her spend the night at his house with his mother. The mother takes a liking to Yuki and asks her to stay. She never leaves for Edo and Minokichi falls in love with her. The two marry and have children, living happily. The older women in the town are in awe over Yuki maintaining her youth even after having three children.\n\nOne night, Minokichi gives Yuki a set of sandals he has made.  She is stitching a kimono in the candlelight.  In the light, Minokichi recalls the Yuki-onna and see a resemblance between them.  He tells her about the strange encounter. It is then that Yuki reveals herself to be the Yuki-onna and a snowstorm comes over the home. Despite the fact he broke his word, she refrains from killing him because of their children. Yuki then leaves Minokichi with the children, warning him to treat them well or she will return and kill him. She disappears into the snowstorm, leaving Minokichi heartbroken.\n\n===Hoichi the Earless===\n{{nihongo|\"Hoichi the Earless\"|\u8033\u7121\u3057\u82b3\u4e00\u306e\u8a71|Miminashi H\u014dichi no Hanashi}} is also adapted from Hearn's ''Kwaidan'' (though it incorporates aspects of ''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'' that are mentioned, but never translated, in Hearn's book).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nHoichi is a young blind musician who plays the biwa. [[Biwa h\u014dshi|biwa hoshi]] His specialty is singing the chant of [[The Tale of the Heike]] about the [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]] fought between the [[Taira clan|Taira]] and [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] clans during the last phase of the [[Genpei War]].  Hoichi is an attendant at a temple and is looked after the others there. One night he hears a sound and decides to play his instrument in the garden courtyard.  A spectral samurai appears and tells him that his lord wishes to have a performance at his house.  The samurai leads Hoichi to mysterious and ancient court.  Another attendant notices that he went missing for the night as his dinner was not touched. The samurai re-appears on the next night to take Hoichi and affirms that he has not told anyone.  Afterwards, the priest asks Hoichi why he goes out at night but Hoichi won't tell him.  One night, Hoichi leaves in a storm and his friends follow him and discover he has been going to a graveyard and reciting the Tale of Heike to the court of the [[Emperor Antoku|dead Emperor]].  Hoichi informs the court that it takes many nights to chant the entire epic.  They direct him to chant the final battle - the battle of Dan-no-ura.  His friends drag him home as he refuses to leave before his performance is completed.\n\nThe priest tell Hoichi he is in great danger and that this was a vast illusion from the spirit of the dead.  They tell Hoichi that if he obeys them again they will tear him to pieces.  Concerned for Hoichi\u2019s safety, a priest and his acolyte write the text of The Heart Sutra on his entire body including his face to make him invisible to the ghosts and instruct him to meditate. The samurai re-appears and calls out for Hoichi.  Hoichi does not answer.  Hoichi's ears are visible to the samurai as they forgot to write the text on his ears.  The samurai, wanting to bring back as much of Hoichi as possible, rips his ears off to show his lord his commands have been obeyed. \n\nThe next morning, the priest and the attendants see a trail of blood leading from the temple.  The priest and the acolyte realize their error and believe the ears were a trade for Hoichi's life.  They believe the spirits will now leave him alone.\n\nA local lord attend at the temple with a full retinue.  They have heard the story of Hoichi the earless and wish to hear him play his biwa.  \nHe is brought to court of the lord.  Hoichi says he will play to console the sorrowful spirits and allow them to rest.  \n\nThe narrator indicates than many wealthy noble person would come to the temple with large gifts of money and Hoichi-the-earless became a wealthy person.\n\n===In a Cup of Tea===\n{{nihongo|\"In a Cup of Tea\"|\u8336\u7897\u306e\u4e2d|Chawan no Naka}} is adapted from Hearn's ''Kott\u014d: Being Japanese Curios, with Sundry Cobwebs'' (1902).\n\nAnticipating a visit from his publisher, a writer relates an old tale of an attendant of Lord Nakagawa Sadono named Sekinai. While Lord Nakagawa is his way to make a New Year's visit, he halts with his train at a tea-house in [[Hakusan, Ishikawa|Hakusan]]. While the party is resting there, Sekinai sees the face of a strange man in a cup of tea. Despite being perturbed, he drinks the cup.\n\nLater, while Sekinai is guarding his Lord, the man whose face appeared in the tea reappears, calling himself Heinai Shikibu. Sekinai runs to tell the other attendants, but they laugh and tell him he is seeing things. Later that night at his own residence, Sekinai is visited by three ghostly attendants of Heinai Shikibu. He duels them and is nearly defeated, but the author notes the tale ends before things are resolved and suggests that he could write a complete ending, but prefers to leave the ending to the reader's imagination.\n\nThe publisher soon arrives and asks the Madame for the author, who is nowhere to be found. They both flee the scene in terror when they discover the author trapped inside a large jar of water.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Kurokami===\n\n* [[Michiyo Aratama]] as First wife\n* [[Misako Watanabe]] as Second Wife\n* [[Rentar\u014d Mikuni]] as Husband\n* [[Kenjiro Ishiyama]] as Father\n* [[Ranko Akagi]] as Mother\n\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Yuki-Onna===\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as Minokichi\n* [[Keiko Kishi]] as the Yuki-Onna \n* [[Y\u016bko Mochizuki]] as Minokichi's mother\n* [[Kin Sugai]] as Village woman\n* [[Noriko Sengoku]] as Village woman\n\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Miminashi H\u014dichi no Hanashi===\n* [[Katsuo Nakamura]] as Hoichi\n* [[Tetsur\u014d Tamba]] as Warrior\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Head priest\n* [[Yoichi Hayashi]] as [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]]\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Chawan no naka===\n* [[Haruko Sugimura]] as Madame\n* [[Osamu Takizawa]] as Author / Narrator\n* [[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]] as Publisher\n* [[Noboru Nakaya]] as Shikibu Heinai\n* [[Seiji Miyaguchi]] as Old man\n* [[Kei Sat\u014d]] as Ghost samurai\n\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 1964, [[Toho]] began a three-film deal with director [[Masaki Kobayashi]] that concluded with the production ''Kwaidan''.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=451}}\n\n==Release==\nThe [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] version of ''Kwaidan'' was released theatrically in Japan on January 6, 1965 where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=217}} The Japanese general release for ''Kwaidan'' began on February 27, 1965.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=218}} ''Kwaidan'' was reedited to 125 minutes in the United States for its theatrical release which eliminated the segment \"The Woman of the Snow\" after the film's Los Angeles premiere.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=217}} It was released in the United States on July 15, 1965 where it was distributed by [[Continental Distributing]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=217}} ''Kwaidan'' was re-released theatrically in Japan on November 29, 1982 in Japan as part of Toho's 50th anniversary.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=332}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=August 2015}}\nIn Japan the film won [[Yoko Mizuki]] the [[Kinema Junpo]] award for Best Screenplay.

In 1991, OU went 9\u20133, finished the season ranked No. 16 in the nation by the Associated Press, and soundly defeated [[1991 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]] in the [[1991 Gator Bowl (December)|Gator Bowl]]. In the 1992 follow-up campaign, however, OU finished 5\u20134\u20132, unranked and did not earn an invitation to a post-season bowl. Further, OU dropped games to rivals Nebraska and Texas and tied Oklahoma State. The draw with the Cowboys marked the first time since 1976 OU did not beat OSU in the annual Bedlam game. Gibbs' Sooners rebounded with a 9\u20133 record, a No. 17 finish in the final Associated Press poll and a Sun Bowl victory in 1993.

His coaching experience was very limited, especially compared to Schnellenberger.

The 79&nbsp;points scored by OU was the most in the country for Week 1. In Week 2, the Sooners played a much tougher opponent in Miami. However, the results seemed to show a mismatch, as OU easily defeated the Hurricanes 51\u201313. In Week 3, the Sooners got the best of [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]] with a 54\u20133 thrashing. Week 4 matched OU up with an in-state foe, [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa]]. Just as it had been all season (except for the Sep 29 loss at unranked Colorado), the Sooners put up another dominant performance with a 62\u201321 victory. In Week 5 (September 29, 2007), the #4 Sooners saw their National Championship hopes take a hit as they lost to 2\u20132 unranked Colorado in Boulder 27\u201324 after leading in the second half by a score of 24\u20137. The Sooners only had 234 net yards compared to Colorado's 379 net yards. The 2007 match-up between Oklahoma and Texas on Oct. 2007 was predicted to be the #3&nbsp;game to watch in 2007 by SI.com's \"Top 20&nbsp;Games To Watch In 2007\" list. The Oklahoma football team proved itself worthy of the top ten rankings when it defeated Texas 28\u201321 at the Red River Rivalry. The Texas Longhorns played up to their potential when they answered almost every point during the October 6&nbsp;game. In the end [[Colt McCoy]] along with [[Jermichael Finley]] and the Longhorns could not withstand the adamant pressing of [[Sam Bradford]], [[DeMarco Murray]] and the Sooners.<ref>{{cite web | title = Top 20 Games To Watch In 2007 | work = SI.com | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0708/top.cfb.games.watch/content.18.html | accessdate =  September 30, 2007 }}</ref>  Oklahoma would go on to lose to an unranked Texas Tech team in an upset, although this was not enough to keep them from the Big 12 championship.

Opening with back to back home victories against Chattanooga and Cincinnati and scoring over 50&nbsp;points against both opponents would vault Oklahoma to number two in both polls, coupled with, then number three, Ohio State's loss and a lackluster victory by, then number two, Georgia over South Carolina. A road victory at Washington where the Sooners again scored more than 50&nbsp;points, a home victory over then undefeated and 24th ranked Texas Christian University, and a road win at Baylor resulted in Oklahoma being ranked number one in both polls after then-ranked number one USC tumbled after a defeat at Oregon State. The Sooners had defeated each of their first five opponents by 25&nbsp;points or more before facing then-number five Texas. In a see-saw battle where Oklahoma would take their last lead at 35\u201330, Texas would come from behind with 15 unanswered points to upset the Sooners at a neutral field by a final score of 45\u201335. The Sooners could muster up only 48 rushing yards while giving up 161. Also of note, the Sooners failed to convert on three fourth down attempts and Bradford threw two interceptions. Oklahoma would fall to number four in the AP Poll and number six in the USA Today Poll, while the Longhorns would be the new number one team in both polls. The game would result in controversy later in the season. Oklahoma would rebound by defeating then-ranked #16 Kansas at home and a road win at Kansas State. By the Week 8 rankings, Oklahoma would be ranked fourth in the AP Poll, fifth in the USA Today Coaches' Poll, and debut at fourth in the BCS behind undefeated Texas, [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]], and [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]]. The Sooners would then go on to defeat their next three opponents by more than 30&nbsp;points each, scoring 60 or more points. A home victory over Nebraska, a road win at Texas A&M and another home win over then-ranked #2 Texas Tech would result in some controversy. Along with an upset of Texas at the hands of Texas Tech and a previous loss by Penn State against [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]], Oklahoma was ranked 3 in the Associated Press Poll and number 2 in the USA Today Coaches' Poll ahead of Texas. However, Texas would be number two in the BCS followed by Oklahoma at number three. Alabama would hold number one in all polls with an undefeated record. Closing out the season with a win against Oklahoma State and Alabama's loss to Florida would leave the Sooners at number two in the Associated Press poll, and number one in both the USA Today Coaches' Poll and the BCS. The result of the three-way tie between Oklahoma, Texas, and Texas Tech in the Big 12 South standings, where each team suffered one loss at the hands of the other, would be the cause for many fans, particularly Texas fans, to cry foul. The Big 12 tie-breaker in this scenario was for the team with the highest BCS ranking to go on to play for the Big 12 Title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recap?gid=200812060024 |title=2008 Big 12 Championship |publisher=RivalsYahoo.com |accessdate=December 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109032857/http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recap?gid=200812060024 |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}</ref> Beating 19th ranked Missouri in Kansas City assured Oklahoma of a number one ranking in both the USA Today Coaches' Poll and the BCS, despite a number two ranking in the Associated Press Poll.

The Sooners would capture the 2015 Big 12 Conference Title. Oklahoma earned the fourth and final spot in the College Football Playoff, as Mayfield would finish fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. The stage was set for a rematch against [[2015 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] in the [[2015 Orange Bowl]]. They would lose, once again, to Clemson by a score of 37-17, even though they led at halftime 17-16. Shepard would leave for the [[2016 NFL Draft]].\n\nThe 2016 season was a continuation of the success the Sooners had the year before. Mayfield was granted the season of eligibility that he had lost due to Big 12 Conference transfer restrictions, and [[Dede Westbrook]] and the controversial, oft-suspended [[Joe Mixon]] had breakthrough years. The Sooners wouldn't be able to make the College Football Playoff this time around, as they lost 2 of their first 3 games (Week 1 vs. [[2016 Houston Cougars football team|Houston]] and Week 3 vs. [[2016 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]]). They still enjoyed a successful season - defeating [[2016 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]] 38\u201320 to win their second Big 12 Conference Title in a row, and having two Heisman Trophy finalists (Mayfield and Westbrook). They would go on to defeat the [[2016 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Tigers]] in the [[2017 Sugar Bowl]], 35-19.

When Keys was enrolled in the university, he took Mex with him to Norman. With his experience as an army medic, Keys landed a job with the football team and a residence at the [[Kappa Sigma]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] house.<ref name=\"OUFBEnc\" /> Mex's main duty during games was to keep stray dogs from roaming the field. He wore a red sweater with a big \"O\" letter on the side. Mex received national attention in October 1924 when the Oklahoma football team lost a game against [[Drake University]]. Mex was lost when the team boarded a train in [[Arkansas City, Kansas]]. The media blamed the loss on the field on the loss of their mascot.<ref name=\"SS_SS&M\">{{cite web|title=Sooner Schooner & Mascots |work=SoonerSports.com |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma]] |url=http://www.soonersports.com/trads/schooner-mascots.html |accessdate=August 21, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811162821/http://www.soonersports.com/trads/schooner-mascots.html |archivedate=August 11, 2007 }}</ref> Mex was found later by two Oklahoma graduates.

The official Alma Mater song is the \"[[OU Chant]]\", which is sung by OU fans before sporting events and at ceremonial occasions.  Other tunes frequently heard at OU football games include the state song \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" and an alternate fight song titled \"Fight for OKU.\"\n\n[[The Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band]] is a nationally renowned ensemble founded in 1904.

In 1991, OU went 9\u20133, finished the season ranked No. 16 in the nation by the Associated Press, and soundly defeated [[1991 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]] in the [[1991 Gator Bowl (December)|Gator Bowl]]. In the 1992 follow-up campaign, however, OU finished 5\u20134\u20132, unranked and did not earn an invitation to a post-season bowl. Further, OU dropped games to rivals Nebraska and Texas and tied Oklahoma State. The draw with the Cowboys marked the first time since 1976 OU did not beat OSU in the annual Bedlam game. Gibbs' Sooners rebounded with a 9\u20133 record, a No. 17 finish in the final Associated Press poll and a Sun Bowl victory in 1993.

His coaching experience was very limited, especially compared to Schnellenberger.

The 79&nbsp;points scored by OU was the most in the country for Week 1. In Week 2, the Sooners played a much tougher opponent in Miami. However, the results seemed to show a mismatch, as OU easily defeated the Hurricanes 51\u201313. In Week 3, the Sooners got the best of [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]] with a 54\u20133 thrashing. Week 4 matched OU up with an in-state foe, [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa]]. Just as it had been all season (except for the Sep 29 loss at unranked Colorado), the Sooners put up another dominant performance with a 62\u201321 victory. In Week 5 (September 29, 2007), the #4 Sooners saw their National Championship hopes take a hit as they lost to 2\u20132 unranked Colorado in Boulder 27\u201324 after leading in the second half by a score of 24\u20137. The Sooners only had 234 net yards compared to Colorado's 379 net yards. The 2007 match-up between Oklahoma and Texas on Oct. 2007 was predicted to be the #3&nbsp;game to watch in 2007 by SI.com's \"Top 20&nbsp;Games To Watch In 2007\" list. The Oklahoma football team proved itself worthy of the top ten rankings when it defeated Texas 28\u201321 at the Red River Rivalry. The Texas Longhorns played up to their potential when they answered almost every point during the October 6&nbsp;game. In the end [[Colt McCoy]] along with [[Jermichael Finley]] and the Longhorns could not withstand the adamant pressing of [[Sam Bradford]], [[DeMarco Murray]] and the Sooners.<ref>{{cite web | title = Top 20 Games To Watch In 2007 | work = SI.com | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0708/top.cfb.games.watch/content.18.html | accessdate =  September 30, 2007 }}</ref>  Oklahoma would go on to lose to an unranked Texas Tech team in an upset, although this was not enough to keep them from the Big 12 championship.

Opening with back to back home victories against Chattanooga and Cincinnati and scoring over 50&nbsp;points against both opponents would vault Oklahoma to number two in both polls, coupled with, then number three, Ohio State's loss and a lackluster victory by, then number two, Georgia over South Carolina. A road victory at Washington where the Sooners again scored more than 50&nbsp;points, a home victory over then undefeated and 24th ranked Texas Christian University, and a road win at Baylor resulted in Oklahoma being ranked number one in both polls after then-ranked number one USC tumbled after a defeat at Oregon State. The Sooners had defeated each of their first five opponents by 25&nbsp;points or more before facing then-number five Texas. In a see-saw battle where Oklahoma would take their last lead at 35\u201330, Texas would come from behind with 15 unanswered points to upset the Sooners at a neutral field by a final score of 45\u201335. The Sooners could muster up only 48 rushing yards while giving up 161. Also of note, the Sooners failed to convert on three fourth down attempts and Bradford threw two interceptions. Oklahoma would fall to number four in the AP Poll and number six in the USA Today Poll, while the Longhorns would be the new number one team in both polls. The game would result in controversy later in the season. Oklahoma would rebound by defeating then-ranked #16 Kansas at home and a road win at Kansas State. By the Week 8 rankings, Oklahoma would be ranked fourth in the AP Poll, fifth in the USA Today Coaches' Poll, and debut at fourth in the BCS behind undefeated Texas, [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]], and [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]]. The Sooners would then go on to defeat their next three opponents by more than 30&nbsp;points each, scoring 60 or more points. A home victory over Nebraska, a road win at Texas A&M and another home win over then-ranked #2 Texas Tech would result in some controversy. Along with an upset of Texas at the hands of Texas Tech and a previous loss by Penn State against [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]], Oklahoma was ranked 3 in the Associated Press Poll and number 2 in the USA Today Coaches' Poll ahead of Texas. However, Texas would be number two in the BCS followed by Oklahoma at number three. Alabama would hold number one in all polls with an undefeated record. Closing out the season with a win against Oklahoma State and Alabama's loss to Florida would leave the Sooners at number two in the Associated Press poll, and number one in both the USA Today Coaches' Poll and the BCS. The result of the three-way tie between Oklahoma, Texas, and Texas Tech in the Big 12 South standings, where each team suffered one loss at the hands of the other, would be the cause for many fans, particularly Texas fans, to cry foul. The Big 12 tie-breaker in this scenario was for the team with the highest BCS ranking to go on to play for the Big 12 Title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recap?gid=200812060024 |title=2008 Big 12 Championship |publisher=RivalsYahoo.com |accessdate=December 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109032857/http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recap?gid=200812060024 |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}</ref> Beating 19th ranked Missouri in Kansas City assured Oklahoma of a number one ranking in both the USA Today Coaches' Poll and the BCS, despite a number two ranking in the Associated Press Poll.

The Sooners would capture the 2015 Big 12 Conference Title. Oklahoma earned the fourth and final spot in the College Football Playoff, as Mayfield would finish fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. The stage was set for a rematch against [[2015 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] in the [[2015 Orange Bowl]]. They would lose, once again, to Clemson by a score of 37-17, even though they led at halftime 17-16. Shepard would leave for the [[2016 NFL Draft]].\n\nThe 2016 season was a continuation of the success the Sooners had the year before. Mayfield was granted the season of eligibility that he had lost due to Big 12 Conference transfer restrictions, and [[Dede Westbrook]] and the controversial, oft-suspended [[Joe Mixon]] had breakthrough years. The Sooners wouldn't be able to make the College Football Playoff this time around, as they lost 2 of their first 3 games (Week 1 vs. [[2016 Houston Cougars football team|Houston]] and Week 3 vs. [[2016 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]]). They still enjoyed a successful season - defeating [[2016 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]] 38\u201320 to win their second Big 12 Conference Title in a row, and having two Heisman Trophy finalists (Mayfield and Westbrook). They would go on to defeat the [[2016 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Tigers]] in the [[2017 Sugar Bowl]], 35-19.

When Keys was enrolled in the university, he took Mex with him to Norman. With his experience as an army medic, Keys landed a job with the football team and a residence at the [[Kappa Sigma]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] house.<ref name=\"OUFBEnc\" /> Mex's main duty during games was to keep stray dogs from roaming the field. He wore a red sweater with a big \"O\" letter on the side. Mex received national attention in October 1924 when the Oklahoma football team lost a game against [[Drake University]]. Mex was lost when the team boarded a train in [[Arkansas City, Kansas]]. The media blamed the loss on the field on the loss of their mascot.<ref name=\"SS_SS&M\">{{cite web|title=Sooner Schooner & Mascots |work=SoonerSports.com |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma]] |url=http://www.soonersports.com/trads/schooner-mascots.html |accessdate=August 21, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811162821/http://www.soonersports.com/trads/schooner-mascots.html |archivedate=August 11, 2007 }}</ref> Mex was found later by two Oklahoma graduates.

The official Alma Mater song is the \"[[OU Chant]]\", which is sung by OU fans before sporting events and at ceremonial occasions.  Other tunes frequently heard at OU football games include the state song \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" and an alternate fight song titled \"Fight for OKU.\"\n\n[[The Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band]] is a nationally renowned ensemble founded in 1904.

It served the industrial Parkside area of [[Frizington]], [[Cumbria]], England.{{sfn|Smith|Turner|2012|loc=Map 26}}{{sfn|Jowett|1989|loc=Map 36}}\n\n==History==\nThe line was one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century. The station opened to passengers on 1 July 1857 as the latest railhead on the line being developed from [[Moor Row railway station|Moor Row]] to [[Rowrah railway station|Rowrah]].\n\nThe station closed with the steep decline of the area's industrial fortunes in the Twentieth Century.\n \n==Services==\nWhilst some Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway (WCER) mineral, goods and passenger traffic to and from Rowrah passed north along the line to Marron Junction, the greater part arrived and left southwards towards [[Moor Row railway station|Moor Row]] and therefore passed through Frizington. Mineral traffic was also generated locally from the quarries and mines such as the Holebeck, Parkside and Crossgill workings on branches within sight of the station.\n\nIn 1922 seven all stations passenger trains called at Frizington in each direction, with an extra on Whitehaven Market Day. Four were Rowrah to Whitehaven services, the other three plied a long, circuitous route between [[Workington Main railway station|Workington Main]] and [[Whitehaven railway station|Whitehaven]] via Camerton, Marron Junction, Ullock, Rowrah and Moor Row.{{sfn|Bradshaw|1985|p=510}}\n\nFrizington station's owning Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont company was taken over by the [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]] and [[Furness Railway]] in 1879 as a Joint Line, whereafter the passenger traffic through the station was usually worked by the LNWR.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=12}}\n\nGoods traffic typically consisted of a two daily turns Up and Down.\n\nMineral traffic was the dominant flow, though this was subject to considerable fluctuation with trade cycles. Stations and signalling along the line south of Rowrah were changed during the Joint regime to conform to Furness Railway standards.<ref>[http://www.cumberlandarchives.co.uk/content/view/239/48/1/13/ W McGowan Gradon's 1942 Furness Railway study, via ''cumberlandarchives.co.uk'']</ref>\n\n==Rundown and closure==\nThe station closed on 13 April 1931 when normal passenger traffic ended along the line, though workmen's trains were reinstated in March 1940, only to be withdrawn a month later.

The station opened to passengers on 1 July 1857 as the latest railhead on the line being developed from [[Moor Row railway station|Moor Row]] to [[Rowrah railway station|Rowrah]].\n\nThe station closed with the steep decline of the area's industrial fortunes in the Twentieth Century.\n \n==Services==\nWhilst some Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway (WCER) mineral, goods and passenger traffic to and from Rowrah passed north along the line to Marron Junction, the greater part arrived and left southwards towards [[Moor Row railway station|Moor Row]] and therefore passed through Frizington. Mineral traffic was also generated locally from the quarries and mines such as the Holebeck, Parkside and Crossgill workings on branches within sight of the station.\n\nIn 1922 seven all stations passenger trains called at Frizington in each direction, with an extra on Whitehaven Market Day. Four were Rowrah to Whitehaven services, the other three plied a long, circuitous route between [[Workington Main railway station|Workington Main]] and [[Whitehaven railway station|Whitehaven]] via Camerton, Marron Junction, Ullock, Rowrah and Moor Row.{{sfn|Bradshaw|1985|p=510}}\n\nFrizington station's owning Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont company was taken over by the [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]] and [[Furness Railway]] in 1879 as a Joint Line, whereafter the passenger traffic through the station was usually worked by the LNWR.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=12}}\n\nGoods traffic typically consisted of a two daily turns Up and Down.\n\nMineral traffic was the dominant flow, though this was subject to considerable fluctuation with trade cycles. Stations and signalling along the line south of Rowrah were changed during the Joint regime to conform to Furness Railway standards.<ref>[http://www.cumberlandarchives.co.uk/content/view/239/48/1/13/ W McGowan Gradon's 1942 Furness Railway study, via ''cumberlandarchives.co.uk'']</ref>\n\n==Rundown and closure==\nThe station closed on 13 April 1931 when normal passenger traffic ended along the line, though workmen's trains were reinstated in March 1940, only to be withdrawn a month later.

On the site of the first OSU game, on the campus of [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in [[Delaware, Ohio]], on May 3, 1890, the Delaware County Historical Society has set an historical marker.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Roman |first=Robert J. |date=2017 |title=Ohio State Football: The Forgotten Dawn |url= |location= |publisher=University of Akron Press |page= |isbn=1629220663 |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nSome histories of Ohio State football credit George Cole, an undergraduate, and [[Alexander S. Lilley]] with introducing the sport to the campus. More recent research has challenged that claim, stating that George Cole persuaded Lilley to coach the football team during its first full season that fall.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nOSU's first home game took place at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on November 1, 1890. They played the [[The College of Wooster|University of Wooster]] on the site that was then called Recreation Park. Just east of historic German Village, the park occupied the north side of Schiller (now Whittier), between Ebner and Jaeger, in what is now Schumacher Place. OSU lost the game, 64\u20130.\n\nOver the next eight years, under a number of coaches, the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins, 39 losses, and 2 ties. The first game against the [[University of Michigan]], in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], was a 34\u20130 loss in 1897, a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1\u20137\u20131 record. Jack Ryder was Ohio State's first paid coach, earning $150 per season, and lost his first game, against [[Oberlin College]] and [[John Heisman]], on October 15, 1892.<ref>Walsh, Christopher (2009).

He passed, ran, received, punted, kicked and played defense. Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and Columbus fans instantly fell in love with the Chic. Harley and the Buckeyes won the very first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916 when the Buckeyes finished 7\u20130. He would repeat in 1917 finishing 8\u20130\u20131, giving the Buckeyes a second outright title. In 1918, he left to be a pilot in the air force for World War I. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one game\u2014to Illinois. Chic Harley left OSU with a career record of 22\u20131\u20131. At the time, OSU played at the small [[Ohio Field]] and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open [[Ohio Stadium]] in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member.\n\nOhio State's very first rival was [[Kenyon College]], a small liberal arts college in [[Gambier, Ohio|Gambier]], roughly 50 miles to the northeast. The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov 27, Kenyon won the first two meetings; however, Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished.  Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU. After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon. The all-time record stands at 18\u20136, OSU.\n\n===Francis Schmidt (1934\u20131940)===\nIn hiring [[Francis Schmidt]] in March 1934 to coach its football team, Ohio State moved its program to a \"big-time\" level of competition. Schmidt was a well-established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator. His offensive schemes were a \"wide-open\" style called \"razzle-dazzle\" and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi-year contract. Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan, all by shut-out. The 1935 squad went 7\u20131, its sole loss was to [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], 18\u201313, in the first contest between the programs. However Schmidt's remaining seasons were less successful, except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship, and his popularity faded for a number of reasons.<ref>Park, p.166.</ref> On December 17, 1940, he resigned.\n\n===Paul Brown (1941\u20131943)===\n[[File:Paul Brown, American football head coach.png|right|thumb|175px|[[Paul Brown]] (shown here as head coach of the [[Cleveland Browns]]) \u2013 who led the Buckeyes to their first national championship in 1942.]]\nOhio State hired the coach of [[Massillon Washington High School]] football team, [[Paul Brown]], to succeed Schmidt. Brown's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship. Brown immediately changed Ohio State's style of offense, planned and organized his program in great detail, and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices. In 1942, Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined World War II, and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship.\n\n===Carroll Widdoes (1944\u20131945), Paul Bixler (1946) and Wes Fesler (1947\u20131950)===\nBrown accepted a commission in the [[United States Navy]] in 1944 and directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence. The 1944 team fielded 31&nbsp;[[First year|freshmen]] but went undefeated and untied, including a victory over Paul Brown's Great Lakes Navy team. Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind [[United States Military Academy#Other sports|Army]] and [[Les Horvath]] became the first Buckeye to be awarded the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Also prominent on the 1942\u201344 teams was the first Buckeye [[African American]] star, [[Bill Willis]].\n\nBrown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war, going into professional football instead. Widdoes, despite having the highest two-year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach, asked to return to an assistant's position. Offensive coordinator [[Paul Bixler]] and Widdoes switched positions, and Bixler endured a mediocre 4\u20133\u20132 season. Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a \"graveyard of coaches\" became commonplace, a reputation that lingered for decades.<ref name=\"SIbix\">{{cite news | year = | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/ncaa/specials/preview/2006/teams/ten/ohiost.html| title = 2006 Team previews- Ohio State| work =  | publisher = SI.com| accessdate = August 20, 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Wes Fesler]] became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history. Ohio State improved greatly in 1948, winning 6 and losing 3, then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore [[Vic Janowicz]]. Ohio State received the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] invitation, where they came from behind to defeat [[California Golden Bears|California]]. In 1950 Fesler, rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics, returned to coach the Buckeyes, who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll. However, the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a [[blizzard]], a game that came to be known as the \"[[Snow Bowl (1950)|Snow Bowl]]\". Two weeks later, citing concerns about his health and family, Fesler resigned.\n\n===Woody Hayes era (1951\u20131978)===\n{{Very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[Woody Hayes|Wayne Woodrow \"Woody\" Hayes]] beat out Paul Brown,<ref>Park, p.275</ref> among others, to be named head coach on February 18, 1951. He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it, alienating many players accustomed to Fesler's laid-back style. The 1951 Buckeyes won 4, lost 3, and tied 2, leaving many to question the ability of the new coach. In 1952 the team improved to 6\u20133, and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years, but after a 1953 loss to Michigan, critics called for the replacement of Hayes.\n\nIn 1954 the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten. Hayes, however, had the talents of [[Howard \"Hopalong\" Cassady]], and a historic goal-line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season. Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship (his first and the team's second). In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten, set an attendance record, and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18&nbsp;years, while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy. Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan (the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year), leading to characterization of Hayes' style of offensive play as \"three yards and a cloud of dust\".\n\nIn a 1955 article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Hayes admitted making small personal loans to financially needy players.<ref name=\"sishaplen\">{{cite web| url = http://www.buckeye50.com/Drive_Drive_Down_the_field_15_to_11.html| title = #11\u2014Iowa at Ohio State\u2014November 11, 1957| publisher = The Buckeye 50 Yard Line| accessdate = October 2, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061127011223/http://www.buckeye50.com/Drive_Drive_Down_the_field_15_to_11.html| archivedate = November 27, 2006| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>  The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] rules, and the faculty council, followed by the Big Ten and NCAA, conducted lengthy investigations. Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth \"Tug\" Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year's probation in 1956. In 1957 Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, win the Rose Bowl over [[University of Oregon|Oregon]], and share a national title with [[Auburn University|Auburn]], for which Hayes was named [[Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award|Coach of the Year]].\n\nIn 1961 the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the [[Football Writers Association of America|FWAA]] but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State's reputation as a \"football school\" resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl, resulting in much public protest and debate.<ref>Park, pp. 340 and 342.</ref>  Over the next 6 seasons Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd, and had a losing season in 1966, and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as coach grew to its highest point since 1953.\n\nIn 1968 Ohio State defeated the number one-ranked [[Purdue Boilermakers]] and continued to an undefeated season including a 50\u201314 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the [[USC Trojans]] that resulted in the national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the \"super sophomores\" in 1968, and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach [[Bo Schembechler]], Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24\u201312 upset.\n\nThe 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as \"The Ten Year War\", in which the rivalry, which pitted some of OSU's and UM's strongest teams ever, rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary.<ref name=\"maisel\">{{cite web | year = | url = http://proxy.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&id=1667333| title = UM-OSU more than just a game| work =  | publisher = ESPN| accessdate = October 13, 2006}}</ref> Four times between 1970 and 1975, Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup.  The Wolverines entered every game during those years undefeated and won only once, a 10\u20137 victory in Ann Arbor on November 20, 1971.\n\nBoth teams used the annual game as motivation for entire seasons and after the initial win by Michigan, played dead even at four wins and a tie apiece. Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war, in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years, while Michigan won the final three. It was also an era in which through television Ohio State football again came to the forefront of national attention.\n\nHayes set the tone in spring practice in 1970, placing a rug at the entrance to the Buckeye dressing room emblazoned with the words: \"1969 MICH 24 OSU 12 \u2014 1970 MICH:__ OSU:__\" as a constant reminder of their objective.<ref>Park, p.391. Park has a picture of the rug.</ref>  The \"super sophomores\", now seniors, used a strong fullback-oriented offense to smash their way through the season undefeated, struggling only with Purdue the week before the Michigan game. The return match in Columbus found both teams undefeated and untied, a \"first\" in the history of the rivalry, with Michigan ranked fourth and Ohio State fifth. Ohio State combined a powerful defense that held Michigan to only 37&nbsp;yards rushing, a rushing offense employing two tight ends as blockers, and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kern to [[Bruce Jankowski]] to win 20\u20139. The Buckeyes returned to the Rose Bowl to be upset by [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]] 27\u201317. The \"super sophomores\" had garnered a record of 27\u20132, the best winning percentage of any three-year period in team history, and won or shared the Big Ten title all three years. The [[National Football Foundation]] named Ohio State its national champion for 1970.\n\n1971 was less successful than the preceding seasons, but the middle four years of the 10-year war saw the greatest success for Hayes against Michigan, although the teams fell short of repeating their 1968 national championship. [[Archie Griffin]] began his college football career in 1972, taking advantage of new NCAA eligibility rules that allowed freshmen to compete at the varsity level. In his second game, sent in against [[North Carolina Tarheels|North Carolina]] late in the first quarter, Griffin set a new Buckeye rushing record with 239&nbsp;yards and led the team in rushing for the season with 867.\n\n[[File:Archie Griffin.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Former Buckeyes RB [[Archie Griffin]], the only two-time [[Heisman Trophy]] winner in college football history (1974\u201375)]]\nThe following season Hayes installed an [[I-formation]] attack with Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore [[Cornelius Greene]] at quarterback. The Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and impenetrable defense, achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game. The only blemish on their record was a 10\u201310 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten. (The tie was more galling for the Wolverines, however, as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.) Despite soundly defeating defending national champion [[University of Southern California|USC]], however, the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Notre Dame]] in the final [[Associated Press|AP]] rankings. Griffin, [[Randy Gradishar]], [[Van DeCree]], and [[John Hicks (American football)|John Hicks]] were named All-Americans; Hicks, an offensive tackle, not only won both the [[Outland Trophy|Outland]] and [[Lombardi Award|Lombardi Trophies]], but placed second in the [[Heisman Trophy]] competition.\n\n1974 and 1975 were seasons of both elation and frustration. The Buckeyes twice more defeated Michigan and went to two Rose Bowls, but lost both. The 1974 team seemed bound for another national championship when it was derailed by a loss to unranked [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] (Ohio State lost only twice in the regular season during Griffin's 4-year career, both to the Spartans), and the next year the #1-ranked Bucks lost 23\u201310 to 11th-ranked [[UCLA]] in the 1976 Rose Bowl. In all the Buckeyes were 40\u20135\u20131 from 1972\u201375, winning the Big Ten all four years and never losing to Michigan, but each loss and the tie were crucial in failing to win another championship. Archie Griffin, however, received the [[Heisman Trophy]] for both years, off-setting much of the frustration, and amassed 5,589&nbsp;yards in his career.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe falloff in success of Hayes' last three years was not great. His teams forged records of 9\u20132\u20131, 9\u20133, and 7\u20134\u20131, and made bowl appearances in all three years (the rules had changed to allow appearances in other than the Rose Bowl). However frustrations in losing three straight years to Michigan, and other factors, resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods, particularly his on-the-field fits of temper. Even so, his downfall was sudden and shocking when near the end of the nationally televised [[Gator Bowl]], Hayes punched [[Clemson Tigers|Clemson]] [[middle guard]] Charlie Bauman after Bauman intercepted a pass to kill Ohio State's last chance to win. Hayes was fired after the game by Ohio State president Harold Enarson and athletic director Hugh Hindman.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Earle Bruce (1979\u20131987)===\n{{Very long section|date=August 2019}}\nHayes was replaced by a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Earle Bruce]]. Bruce inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback [[Art Schlichter]] but that had also lost 11 starters, and the 1979 squad exceeded pre-season expectations, ending the 3-year loss drought against Michigan and going to the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] with an opportunity once again to be national champions. The Buckeyes lost both by a single point, 17\u201316, but Bruce was named [[Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award|Coach of the Year]]. His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a \"new era\".<ref name=\"earle\">{{cite news | year = | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946372-1,00.html| title = Making 'Em Forget Woody| work =  | publisher = Time Magazine| accessdate = December 11, 2006 | date=November 12, 1979}}</ref>\n\n1980, however, saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce, when Ohio State finished with a 9\u20133 record, the first of six consecutive years at 9\u20133. Though each of these seasons, and the 10\u20133 season that followed them, culminated in a bowl game, Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era. Bruce's teams were not without impact players, however. All-Americans and future [[National Football League]] stars included [[Keith Byars]], [[Cris Carter]], [[Chris Spielman]], [[John E. Frank|John Frank]], [[Jim Lachey]], [[Tom Tupa]], [[Marcus Marek]], and [[Pepper Johnson]]. His program was also known for the number of notable assistant coaches on staff, including [[Jim Tressel]], [[Glen Mason]], [[Pete Carroll]], [[Nick Saban]], [[Urban Meyer]] and [[Dom Capers]].\n\nThe 1980 team was selected as the top-ranked team of the pre-season AP poll and opened the season with four games at home, but were shocked in the fourth game by UCLA, shut out 17\u20130. The team rebounded to win its next six easily, but then were shut down by a ball-control Michigan team that allowed the Buckeyes only 23 minutes with the ball, then lost again to [[Penn State Nittany Lions|Penn State]] in the [[Fiesta Bowl]].\n\nIn 1981, Ohio State opened strong, including a victory at [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]] in which senior Art Schlichter out-dueled [[John Elway]], but then lost back-to-back games to [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]] and [[Wisconsin Badgers|Wisconsin]] (their first victory over the Buckeyes in 22 games). The Buckeyes continued to struggle on defense, losing a third time, at [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|Minnesota]]. Victories over Michigan to gain a share of the Big Ten championship and over [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]] in the [[Liberty Bowl]] salvaged the season.\n\nFor the first time since 1922 the Buckeyes lost three in a row in Ohio Stadium in 1982, including rematches with Stanford and Florida State, and for the second year in a row to Wisconsin, but then won seven straight, the last over [[Brigham Young University#Football|BYU]] in the [[Holiday Bowl]]. Sophomore running back Keith Byars had a stand-out season in 1983, rushing for 1,199 yards, and Ohio State defeated the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], but three losses in conference meant a 4th-place finish. 1984 witnessed what Bruce called \"the greatest comeback after the worst start\" when Ohio State fell behind Illinois 24\u20130 at home but roared back on 274 yards rushing and five touchdowns by Byars to win 45\u201338. Ohio State also defeated Michigan to win an outright Big Ten championship. Byars led the nation in rushing and scoring but finished second in Heisman balloting.\n\nByars broke his toe just prior to the start of the 1985 season, ending his Heisman hopes and seriously handicapping the Buckeye attack. He returned against Purdue with Ohio State at 4\u20131 and scored twice, but then re-injured his foot the next week against Minnesota. Iowa was top-ranked nationally when they came into Ohio Stadium favored to end the longest home winning streak in the country, and were the first #1 team the Buckeyes faced since Purdue in 1968. Ohio State's defense dominated with four interceptions to win 22\u201313.\n\nIn 1986 Bruce received a 3-year contract, the first for the modern program but the team opened with two losses, which had not occurred in over 90 years. The Buckeyes then won 9 in a row before Michigan took a close game when kicker Matt Frantz missed a field goal with a minute to play. After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the University of Arizona with a 5-year contract but was persuaded to stay at his [[alma mater]] by Athletic Director Rick Bay. Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All-American wide receiver [[Cris Carter]] was dropped from the team for signing with an agent. Indiana defeated Ohio State for the first time since 1951, 31\u201310, in a game that came to be known as the \"darkest day\", and Ohio State lost three conference games in a row going into the Michigan game.\n\nOn the Monday of Michigan week, after a weekend of rumors and speculation, Ohio State President [[Edward H. Jennings|Edward Jennings]] fired Bruce but tried to keep the dismissal secret until after the end of the season. Bay, who had been instrumental in keeping Bruce at Ohio State, disregarded Jennings' orders and announced the firing and his own resignation in protest. Jennings made his own situation worse by refusing to give a reason for the firing and the circumstances have been the subject of controversy since.<ref>Park, pp. 537\u2013538</ref> The Buckeyes enjoyed an emotional come-from-behind victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor after the entire team wore [[headband]]s bearing the word \"EARLE\", then declined an invitation to play in the [[Sun Bowl]].\n\n===John Cooper (1988\u20132000)===\n{{Very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[John Cooper (coach)|John Cooper]] was hired as the 21st football head coach at Ohio State before the end of 1987 and before he had coached his last game at [[Arizona State University]]. Cooper's coaching record at ASU and at [[University of Tulsa|Tulsa]] prior to that stood out among his credentials, as did a victory over Michigan in the 1987 Rose Bowl.\n\nCooper's thirteen years as Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in the litany of negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2\u201310\u20131 record against Michigan, a 3\u20138 record in bowl games, a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6\u20137 record overall, and blowing a 15-point 3rd quarter lead in a 28\u201324 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top-ranked team in the nation and en route to a national championship. However his record also has many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two finishes second-ranked in the polls, and three Big Ten championships (albeit shared). Cooper also recruited 15 players who were first-round draft picks in the [[National Football League]].<ref name=\"coopbio\">{{cite web| year = | url = http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/cooper_john01.html| title = John Cooper Profile| work = | publisher = TOSU Football Official Site| accessdate = December 19, 2006}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Red Director |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nBoth 1988 and 1989 began identically: an impressive season-opening win followed by an embarrassing loss to a highly regarded team ([[Pitt Panthers|Pitt]] and [[USC Trojans|USC]]); a rebound win against two other highly regarded programs ([[LSU Tigers|LSU]] and [[Boston College Eagles|Boston College]]) followed by a loss to Illinois in the conference opener.

His loss in the Outback Bowl to a team that had not even won a single game the year before was a factor in his subsequent firing, as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game.  Other contributing factors included the record against Michigan (which was actually considered by most people to be the biggest reason for his firing), a reputation of inability to win \"big games\", the lack of a national championship, the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni, the poor bowl game record, and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team.\n\n===Jim Tressel (2001\u20132010)===\n[[File:Coach Tressel.png|175px|thumb|left|Former head coach [[Jim Tressel]], who led the Buckeyes to the 2002 national championship, and six Big Ten titles.]]\nOhio State quickly sought a replacement for Cooper and after a nationwide search hired Jim Tressel.

its most renowned and intense, Ohio State has two other series marked by their longevity, both [[Big Ten Conference]] rivals, those of [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini|Illinois]]. The series versus Indiana began as a non-conference matchup, with Indiana going undefeated at 4\u20130\u20131. In conference, however, the Buckeyes (despite losing the opening conference game) are 70\u20138\u20134 through the 2014 season, the most wins against any opponent. Illinois also began with non-conference games (0\u20131\u20131) but became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year (that record was tied by Michigan in 2007). Through 2014 Ohio State's record against the Illini is 66\u201330\u20134. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini.\n\nWhen Penn State was added to the conference football play in 1993, every member was given two designated rivals, teams to be played every year, with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals. For geographic convenience, the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State's new designated rival in addition to Michigan, and Illinois was set to be paired with in-state rival [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] and neighboring Indiana despite Ohio State's historical rivalry with Illinois.\n\nWith Nebraska's entry to the Big Ten and the establishment of division play in football, Ohio State and Illinois played every season in the Leaders Division from 2011 to 2013. Michigan was the Buckeyes' permanent cross-division rival from the Legends Division.\n\nWith the addition of Maryland and Rutgers to the Big Ten, Ohio State and Illinois will be in separate divisions and will no longer meet every year. Ohio State and Michigan also became East Division rivals.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2013/04/28/big-ten-sets-new-divisions-nine-game-schedule/2119055/ | work=USA Today | first1=Mark | last1=Snyder | title=Big Ten approves new divisions, schedule | date=April 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Coaches==\n{{See also|List of Ohio State Buckeyes head football coaches}}\nThe Buckeyes have had 24 head coaches in their 121-year history.

They played the [[The College of Wooster|University of Wooster]] on the site that was then called Recreation Park. Just east of historic German Village, the park occupied the north side of Schiller (now Whittier), between Ebner and Jaeger, in what is now Schumacher Place. OSU lost the game, 64\u20130.\n\nOver the next eight years, under a number of coaches, the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins, 39 losses, and 2 ties. The first game against the [[University of Michigan]], in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], was a 34\u20130 loss in 1897, a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1\u20137\u20131 record. Jack Ryder was Ohio State's first paid coach, earning $150 per season, and lost his first game, against [[Oberlin College]] and [[John Heisman]], on October 15, 1892.<ref>Walsh, Christopher (2009).

He passed, ran, received, punted, kicked and played defense. Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and Columbus fans instantly fell in love with the Chic. Harley and the Buckeyes won the very first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916 when the Buckeyes finished 7\u20130. He would repeat in 1917 finishing 8\u20130\u20131, giving the Buckeyes a second outright title. In 1918, he left to be a pilot in the air force for World War I. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one game\u2014to Illinois. Chic Harley left OSU with a career record of 22\u20131\u20131. At the time, OSU played at the small [[Ohio Field]] and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open [[Ohio Stadium]] in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member.\n\nOhio State's very first rival was [[Kenyon College]], a small liberal arts college in [[Gambier, Ohio|Gambier]], roughly 50 miles to the northeast. The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov 27, Kenyon won the first two meetings; however, Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished.  Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU. After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon. The all-time record stands at 18\u20136, OSU.\n\n===Francis Schmidt (1934\u20131940)===\nIn hiring [[Francis Schmidt]] in March 1934 to coach its football team, Ohio State moved its program to a \"big-time\" level of competition. Schmidt was a well-established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator. His offensive schemes were a \"wide-open\" style called \"razzle-dazzle\" and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi-year contract. Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan, all by shut-out. The 1935 squad went 7\u20131, its sole loss was to [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], 18\u201313, in the first contest between the programs. However Schmidt's remaining seasons were less successful, except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship, and his popularity faded for a number of reasons.<ref>Park, p.166.</ref> On December 17, 1940, he resigned.\n\n===Paul Brown (1941\u20131943)===\n[[File:Paul Brown, American football head coach.png|right|thumb|175px|[[Paul Brown]] (shown here as head coach of the [[Cleveland Browns]]) \u2013 who led the Buckeyes to their first national championship in 1942.]]\nOhio State hired the coach of [[Massillon Washington High School]] football team, [[Paul Brown]], to succeed Schmidt. Brown's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship. Brown immediately changed Ohio State's style of offense, planned and organized his program in great detail, and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices. In 1942, Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined World War II, and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship.\n\n===Carroll Widdoes (1944\u20131945), Paul Bixler (1946) and Wes Fesler (1947\u20131950)===\nBrown accepted a commission in the [[United States Navy]] in 1944 and directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence. The 1944 team fielded 31&nbsp;[[First year|freshmen]] but went undefeated and untied, including a victory over Paul Brown's Great Lakes Navy team. Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind [[United States Military Academy#Other sports|Army]] and [[Les Horvath]] became the first Buckeye to be awarded the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Also prominent on the 1942\u201344 teams was the first Buckeye [[African American]] star, [[Bill Willis]].\n\nBrown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war, going into professional football instead. Widdoes, despite having the highest two-year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach, asked to return to an assistant's position. Offensive coordinator [[Paul Bixler]] and Widdoes switched positions, and Bixler endured a mediocre 4\u20133\u20132 season. Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a \"graveyard of coaches\" became commonplace, a reputation that lingered for decades.<ref name=\"SIbix\">{{cite news | year = | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/ncaa/specials/preview/2006/teams/ten/ohiost.html| title = 2006 Team previews- Ohio State| work =  | publisher = SI.com| accessdate = August 20, 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Wes Fesler]] became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history. Ohio State improved greatly in 1948, winning 6 and losing 3, then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore [[Vic Janowicz]]. Ohio State received the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] invitation, where they came from behind to defeat [[California Golden Bears|California]]. In 1950 Fesler, rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics, returned to coach the Buckeyes, who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll. However, the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a [[blizzard]], a game that came to be known as the \"[[Snow Bowl (1950)|Snow Bowl]]\". Two weeks later, citing concerns about his health and family, Fesler resigned.\n\n===Woody Hayes era (1951\u20131978)===\n{{Very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[Woody Hayes|Wayne Woodrow \"Woody\" Hayes]] beat out Paul Brown,<ref>Park, p.275</ref> among others, to be named head coach on February 18, 1951. He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it, alienating many players accustomed to Fesler's laid-back style. The 1951 Buckeyes won 4, lost 3, and tied 2, leaving many to question the ability of the new coach. In 1952 the team improved to 6\u20133, and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years, but after a 1953 loss to Michigan, critics called for the replacement of Hayes.\n\nIn 1954 the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten. Hayes, however, had the talents of [[Howard \"Hopalong\" Cassady]], and a historic goal-line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season. Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship (his first and the team's second). In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten, set an attendance record, and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18&nbsp;years, while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy. Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan (the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year), leading to characterization of Hayes' style of offensive play as \"three yards and a cloud of dust\".\n\nIn a 1955 article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Hayes admitted making small personal loans to financially needy players.<ref name=\"sishaplen\">{{cite web| url = http://www.buckeye50.com/Drive_Drive_Down_the_field_15_to_11.html| title = #11\u2014Iowa at Ohio State\u2014November 11, 1957| publisher = The Buckeye 50 Yard Line| accessdate = October 2, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061127011223/http://www.buckeye50.com/Drive_Drive_Down_the_field_15_to_11.html| archivedate = November 27, 2006| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>  The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] rules, and the faculty council, followed by the Big Ten and NCAA, conducted lengthy investigations. Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth \"Tug\" Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year's probation in 1956. In 1957 Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, win the Rose Bowl over [[University of Oregon|Oregon]], and share a national title with [[Auburn University|Auburn]], for which Hayes was named [[Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award|Coach of the Year]].\n\nIn 1961 the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the [[Football Writers Association of America|FWAA]] but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State's reputation as a \"football school\" resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl, resulting in much public protest and debate.<ref>Park, pp. 340 and 342.</ref>  Over the next 6 seasons Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd, and had a losing season in 1966, and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as coach grew to its highest point since 1953.\n\nIn 1968 Ohio State defeated the number one-ranked [[Purdue Boilermakers]] and continued to an undefeated season including a 50\u201314 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the [[USC Trojans]] that resulted in the national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the \"super sophomores\" in 1968, and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach [[Bo Schembechler]], Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24\u201312 upset.\n\nThe 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as \"The Ten Year War\", in which the rivalry, which pitted some of OSU's and UM's strongest teams ever, rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary.<ref name=\"maisel\">{{cite web | year = | url = http://proxy.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&id=1667333| title = UM-OSU more than just a game| work =  | publisher = ESPN| accessdate = October 13, 2006}}</ref> Four times between 1970 and 1975, Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup.  The Wolverines entered every game during those years undefeated and won only once, a 10\u20137 victory in Ann Arbor on November 20, 1971.\n\nBoth teams used the annual game as motivation for entire seasons and after the initial win by Michigan, played dead even at four wins and a tie apiece. Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war, in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years, while Michigan won the final three. It was also an era in which through television Ohio State football again came to the forefront of national attention.\n\nHayes set the tone in spring practice in 1970, placing a rug at the entrance to the Buckeye dressing room emblazoned with the words: \"1969 MICH 24 OSU 12 \u2014 1970 MICH:__ OSU:__\" as a constant reminder of their objective.<ref>Park, p.391. Park has a picture of the rug.</ref>  The \"super sophomores\", now seniors, used a strong fullback-oriented offense to smash their way through the season undefeated, struggling only with Purdue the week before the Michigan game. The return match in Columbus found both teams undefeated and untied, a \"first\" in the history of the rivalry, with Michigan ranked fourth and Ohio State fifth. Ohio State combined a powerful defense that held Michigan to only 37&nbsp;yards rushing, a rushing offense employing two tight ends as blockers, and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kern to [[Bruce Jankowski]] to win 20\u20139. The Buckeyes returned to the Rose Bowl to be upset by [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]] 27\u201317. The \"super sophomores\" had garnered a record of 27\u20132, the best winning percentage of any three-year period in team history, and won or shared the Big Ten title all three years. The [[National Football Foundation]] named Ohio State its national champion for 1970.\n\n1971 was less successful than the preceding seasons, but the middle four years of the 10-year war saw the greatest success for Hayes against Michigan, although the teams fell short of repeating their 1968 national championship. [[Archie Griffin]] began his college football career in 1972, taking advantage of new NCAA eligibility rules that allowed freshmen to compete at the varsity level. In his second game, sent in against [[North Carolina Tarheels|North Carolina]] late in the first quarter, Griffin set a new Buckeye rushing record with 239&nbsp;yards and led the team in rushing for the season with 867.\n\n[[File:Archie Griffin.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Former Buckeyes RB [[Archie Griffin]], the only two-time [[Heisman Trophy]] winner in college football history (1974\u201375)]]\nThe following season Hayes installed an [[I-formation]] attack with Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore [[Cornelius Greene]] at quarterback. The Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and impenetrable defense, achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game. The only blemish on their record was a 10\u201310 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten. (The tie was more galling for the Wolverines, however, as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.) Despite soundly defeating defending national champion [[University of Southern California|USC]], however, the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Notre Dame]] in the final [[Associated Press|AP]] rankings. Griffin, [[Randy Gradishar]], [[Van DeCree]], and [[John Hicks (American football)|John Hicks]] were named All-Americans; Hicks, an offensive tackle, not only won both the [[Outland Trophy|Outland]] and [[Lombardi Award|Lombardi Trophies]], but placed second in the [[Heisman Trophy]] competition.\n\n1974 and 1975 were seasons of both elation and frustration. The Buckeyes twice more defeated Michigan and went to two Rose Bowls, but lost both. The 1974 team seemed bound for another national championship when it was derailed by a loss to unranked [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] (Ohio State lost only twice in the regular season during Griffin's 4-year career, both to the Spartans), and the next year the #1-ranked Bucks lost 23\u201310 to 11th-ranked [[UCLA]] in the 1976 Rose Bowl. In all the Buckeyes were 40\u20135\u20131 from 1972\u201375, winning the Big Ten all four years and never losing to Michigan, but each loss and the tie were crucial in failing to win another championship. Archie Griffin, however, received the [[Heisman Trophy]] for both years, off-setting much of the frustration, and amassed 5,589&nbsp;yards in his career.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe falloff in success of Hayes' last three years was not great. His teams forged records of 9\u20132\u20131, 9\u20133, and 7\u20134\u20131, and made bowl appearances in all three years (the rules had changed to allow appearances in other than the Rose Bowl). However frustrations in losing three straight years to Michigan, and other factors, resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods, particularly his on-the-field fits of temper. Even so, his downfall was sudden and shocking when near the end of the nationally televised [[Gator Bowl]], Hayes punched [[Clemson Tigers|Clemson]] [[middle guard]] Charlie Bauman after Bauman intercepted a pass to kill Ohio State's last chance to win. Hayes was fired after the game by Ohio State president Harold Enarson and athletic director Hugh Hindman.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Earle Bruce (1979\u20131987)===\n{{Very long section|date=August 2019}}\nHayes was replaced by a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Earle Bruce]]. Bruce inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback [[Art Schlichter]] but that had also lost 11 starters, and the 1979 squad exceeded pre-season expectations, ending the 3-year loss drought against Michigan and going to the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] with an opportunity once again to be national champions. The Buckeyes lost both by a single point, 17\u201316, but Bruce was named [[Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award|Coach of the Year]]. His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a \"new era\".<ref name=\"earle\">{{cite news | year = | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946372-1,00.html| title = Making 'Em Forget Woody| work =  | publisher = Time Magazine| accessdate = December 11, 2006 | date=November 12, 1979}}</ref>\n\n1980, however, saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce, when Ohio State finished with a 9\u20133 record, the first of six consecutive years at 9\u20133. Though each of these seasons, and the 10\u20133 season that followed them, culminated in a bowl game, Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era. Bruce's teams were not without impact players, however. All-Americans and future [[National Football League]] stars included [[Keith Byars]], [[Cris Carter]], [[Chris Spielman]], [[John E. Frank|John Frank]], [[Jim Lachey]], [[Tom Tupa]], [[Marcus Marek]], and [[Pepper Johnson]]. His program was also known for the number of notable assistant coaches on staff, including [[Jim Tressel]], [[Glen Mason]], [[Pete Carroll]], [[Nick Saban]], [[Urban Meyer]] and [[Dom Capers]].\n\nThe 1980 team was selected as the top-ranked team of the pre-season AP poll and opened the season with four games at home, but were shocked in the fourth game by UCLA, shut out 17\u20130. The team rebounded to win its next six easily, but then were shut down by a ball-control Michigan team that allowed the Buckeyes only 23 minutes with the ball, then lost again to [[Penn State Nittany Lions|Penn State]] in the [[Fiesta Bowl]].\n\nIn 1981, Ohio State opened strong, including a victory at [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]] in which senior Art Schlichter out-dueled [[John Elway]], but then lost back-to-back games to [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]] and [[Wisconsin Badgers|Wisconsin]] (their first victory over the Buckeyes in 22 games). The Buckeyes continued to struggle on defense, losing a third time, at [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|Minnesota]]. Victories over Michigan to gain a share of the Big Ten championship and over [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]] in the [[Liberty Bowl]] salvaged the season.\n\nFor the first time since 1922 the Buckeyes lost three in a row in Ohio Stadium in 1982, including rematches with Stanford and Florida State, and for the second year in a row to Wisconsin, but then won seven straight, the last over [[Brigham Young University#Football|BYU]] in the [[Holiday Bowl]]. Sophomore running back Keith Byars had a stand-out season in 1983, rushing for 1,199 yards, and Ohio State defeated the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], but three losses in conference meant a 4th-place finish. 1984 witnessed what Bruce called \"the greatest comeback after the worst start\" when Ohio State fell behind Illinois 24\u20130 at home but roared back on 274 yards rushing and five touchdowns by Byars to win 45\u201338. Ohio State also defeated Michigan to win an outright Big Ten championship. Byars led the nation in rushing and scoring but finished second in Heisman balloting.\n\nByars broke his toe just prior to the start of the 1985 season, ending his Heisman hopes and seriously handicapping the Buckeye attack. He returned against Purdue with Ohio State at 4\u20131 and scored twice, but then re-injured his foot the next week against Minnesota. Iowa was top-ranked nationally when they came into Ohio Stadium favored to end the longest home winning streak in the country, and were the first #1 team the Buckeyes faced since Purdue in 1968. Ohio State's defense dominated with four interceptions to win 22\u201313.\n\nIn 1986 Bruce received a 3-year contract, the first for the modern program but the team opened with two losses, which had not occurred in over 90 years. The Buckeyes then won 9 in a row before Michigan took a close game when kicker Matt Frantz missed a field goal with a minute to play. After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the University of Arizona with a 5-year contract but was persuaded to stay at his [[alma mater]] by Athletic Director Rick Bay. Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All-American wide receiver [[Cris Carter]] was dropped from the team for signing with an agent.

Bay, who had been instrumental in keeping Bruce at Ohio State, disregarded Jennings' orders and announced the firing and his own resignation in protest.

its most renowned and intense, Ohio State has two other series marked by their longevity, both [[Big Ten Conference]] rivals, those of [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini|Illinois]]. The series versus Indiana began as a non-conference matchup, with Indiana going undefeated at 4\u20130\u20131. In conference, however, the Buckeyes (despite losing the opening conference game) are 70\u20138\u20134 through the 2014 season, the most wins against any opponent. Illinois also began with non-conference games (0\u20131\u20131) but became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year (that record was tied by Michigan in 2007). Through 2014 Ohio State's record against the Illini is 66\u201330\u20134. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini.\n\nWhen Penn State was added to the conference football play in 1993, every member was given two designated rivals, teams to be played every year, with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals. For geographic convenience, the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State's new designated rival in addition to Michigan, and Illinois was set to be paired with in-state rival [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] and neighboring Indiana despite Ohio State's historical rivalry with Illinois.\n\nWith Nebraska's entry to the Big Ten and the establishment of division play in football, Ohio State and Illinois played every season in the Leaders Division from 2011 to 2013. Michigan was the Buckeyes' permanent cross-division rival from the Legends Division.\n\nWith the addition of Maryland and Rutgers to the Big Ten, Ohio State and Illinois will be in separate divisions and will no longer meet every year. Ohio State and Michigan also became East Division rivals.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2013/04/28/big-ten-sets-new-divisions-nine-game-schedule/2119055/ | work=USA Today | first1=Mark | last1=Snyder | title=Big Ten approves new divisions, schedule | date=April 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Coaches==\n{{See also|List of Ohio State Buckeyes head football coaches}}\nThe Buckeyes have had 24 head coaches in their 121-year history.
