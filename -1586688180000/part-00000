He continued to work his way up the card when he was legitimately injured seriously in a car accident in 1983. He spent several months recovering before returning to the ring; upon his return, he stated on television that WWF Champion [[Bob Backlund]] had been a tremendous inspiration to him. Gilbert continued wrestling for the WWF until 1984.<ref name=\"Lentz2015\"/>\n\n===Mid-Southern Wrestling (1984\u20131986)===\nLater, he began making a name for himself as Eddie Gilbert in CWA in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He teamed with his father and [[Ricky Morton]] in those years. In addition, he formed a team with [[Tommy Rich]] as \"Fargo's Fabulous Ones\", an attempt by Mid-Southern (Memphis) to bury and still cash in on the fame attained by the previous incarnation of the [[Fabulous Ones]], [[Steve Keirn]] and [[Stan Lane]], who walked out of the territory after a dispute. They held the AWA Southern Tag Team titles in 1984 until dropping them to Phil Hickerson and the Spoiler (Frank Morrell). The duo would break up soon after, with Gilbert turning heel. The two had a brief but intense feud, which memorably began on television when the two were presented with a \"Tag Team of the Year\" award by announcer [[Lance Russell]] and two guests. Gilbert, unaware his former partner was at the taping, badmouthed Rich, then the International Heavyweight Champion, until Rich came out to confront him. Rich immediately got the upper hand, running Gibert into the steel ringpost several times, bloodying him in the process before the cameras went to a commercial. After the commercial break, Gilbert told Russell he wanted Rich to come back out so he could apologize to him in person, stating he was wrong for still being bitter about the break-up of the team, and was fueled by jealousy of Rich's championship title reign and new found star status. When Rich accepted Gilbert's apology, Gilbert suddenly turned on him and, in front of a stunned audience and a speechless Russell, rammed Rich's head into the ringpost, just as Rich had done to him moments earlier. Gilbert then made his way to Bill Watts' Mid-South territory.\n\n===Universal Wrestling Federation (1986-1987)===\nIn 1986, Gilbert went to work for Bill Watts at [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], Eddie added the \"Hot Stuff\" to his name. He started a heel stable of wrestlers called \"Hot Stuff International, Inc.\" and he managed it and wrestled. His stable included [[Steve Borden|Sting]], [[Jim Hellwig|Ultimate Warrior]] and [[Rick Steiner]] before they were stars. He was always a ladies' man and he stole [[Missy Hyatt]] from [[John Tatum (wrestler)|John Tatum]] in 1987, with his stable being renamed \"H & H International, Inc.\" He married Hyatt in 1988. [[Iceman Parsons]] and [[Dick Murdoch]] would also join his stable later on at different times as well. Sting would eventually leave \"Hot Stuff International, Inc.\" and feud with them.\n\nEddie also worked as a booker, who came up with the famous ''Battle of New Orleans'' angle in late-1987 involving Chris Adams, Terry Taylor, Sting, and himself.  Following a match in which Taylor defeated [[Shane Douglas]] due to interference by both Gilbert and [[Rick Steiner]], Adams told referee [[Randy Anderson]] of the interference.  As Adams pleaded his case with Anderson, Gilbert and Taylor attacked him, and Sting eventually evened the sides.  The angle eventually spilled outside the ring into the stands, and near the concession area, featuring a huge brawl involving beer kegs, chairs, trash cans, tables, popcorn machines and other objects. Gilbert was awarded [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Best Booker|Best Booker of 1988]] by the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]''. He would stay with the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] until the Purchase from [[Jim Crockett Promotions]]\n\n===Continental Wrestling Federation (1988)===\nFrom there, Gilbert worked in Alabama's [[Continental Wrestling Federation]] (CWF), where he reformed Hot Stuff Inc. Gilbert also served as booker, with [[Paul Heyman]] as his assistant. The CWF was broadcast nationally on the [[Financial News Network]], and Gilbert's creative work was widely praised by wrestling journalists.<ref>[http://www.eddiegilbert.com/profile1.html Profile of Eddie Gilbert], part 1. EddieGilbert.com</ref> However, Gilbert left due to conflicts with management.\n\n===Jim Crockett Promotions / NWA World Championship Wrestling (1988\u20131989)===\nGilbert went to the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]]'s [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) -- which had purchased the UWF\u2014and brought Hyatt, Heyman and his brother [[Doug Gilbert]] with him. Eddie teamed with Rick Steiner to feud with [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and his [[The Varsity Club|Varsity Club]]. He also became involved in a feud with [[Ric Flair]] and [[Barry Windham]] in which he teamed with [[Ricky Steamboat]] and [[Lex Luger]]. Near the end of his stint there, JCP was renamed [[World Championship Wrestling]], and Gilbert was featured in the first [[World Championship Wrestling (video game)|WCW video game]].\n\n===USWA and various promotions (1989\u20131995)===\nEddie left WCW in late 1989 and also divorced Hyatt. He went back to [[Independent circuit|the independents]] where he could book again. He worked for the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA) in Memphis (where he feuded with Jerry Lawler)<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/88 88]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/88}}</ref> and the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] (GWF), as well as Philadelphia's Tri-State Wrestling Alliance promotion. Gilbert also married [[Debrah Miceli|Madusa]] at this time after having hit it off with Madusa on TWA promoter Joel Goodhart's radio show, but the marriage was brief.\n\nGilbert's most famous feud in the Memphis territory involved an angle between himself and Lawler in 1990. Eddie and his brother [[Doug Gilbert|Doug]] were \"[[Kayfabe#\"You're fired!\" and \"I quit!\"|fired]]\" from the promotion, and in retaliation hit Lawler with their car and fled the scene. Numerous home viewers, fearing for Lawler, immediately called the police to report what they had just seen as a legitimate vehicular [[assault]]. Lawler had to inform the police what was going on and Lawler was forced to appear on television (while [[Sell (professional wrestling)|selling]] his \"injuries\") sooner than intended out of concern that Gilbert would have been legitimately arrested if he didn't show on TV that he was all right.\n\nGilbert quit the USWA in January 1991. The on air story was that he had chose to leave the promotion rather than be injured by [[Jim Cornette]], [[Stan Lane]], and [[Steve Keirn]].<ref name=211991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/january-21-1991-wrestling-observer-newsletter-ric-flair-defeats-sting|title=January 21, 1991 Wrestling Observer Newsletter: Ric Flair defeats Sting for his 7th World title win, more|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=January 21, 1991|accessdate=September 4, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nDue to a pay dispute, Gilbert, along with his brother Doug (who wrestled under a mask as the [[Dark Patriot]]) left the GWF in 1992. Eddie Gilbert took with him the [[GWF North American Heavyweight Championship]] belt. He made a few defenses of the title in the USWA as the GWF World Heavyweight champion, despite being stripped of the belt and not being recognized as such by the GWF.\n\nHe wrestled in (and booked) the successor to Tri-State Wrestling.\n\nGilbert then returned to the USWA until early 1995 when he worked one night for [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] before traveling to [[World Wrestling Council]] in [[Puerto Rico]] to wrestle and book.\n\n===Eastern Championship Wrestling (1993)===\nIn 1993 he wrestled for NWA [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]], where he again teamed with Doug. He also served as head booker, but gave up his position in September 1993 to Paul Heyman, who eventually took the company national under the name Extreme Championship Wrestling. He would have a feud with [[Terry Funk]].\n\n===Looking For Mr. Gilbert Shoot Interview===\nIn early 1994, Gilbert sat down with Bob Barnett and conducted a filmed [[shoot interview]] titled \"Looking For Mr. Gilbert.\" Gilbert spoke openly about his life and career at a time when professional wrestlers rarely appeared on film out of character and almost never spoke publicly about the behind-the-scenes machinations of the wrestling business. The footage from the interview was later marketed on home video and sold through wrestling newsletters, as well as at independent wrestling shows, the first of its kind. \"Looking For Mr. Gilbert\" is now considered the first professional wrestling \"shoot video\", and in the decades since, countless professional wrestlers have conducted sit-down shoot interviews, most notably in RF Video's Shoot Interview series and Kayfabe Commentaries' YouShoot interview series.\n\n==Personal life==\nGilbert married wrestling valet [[Missy Hyatt]] in October 1987. The couple divorced in 1989. Gilbert was also briefly married to [[Debrah Miceli|Debrah \"Madusa\" Miceli]] in 1992.\n\n==Death==\nOn February 18, 1995, Gilbert died of a heart attack in his apartment in [[Isla Verde, Puerto Rico]].<ref name=\"PS55\">{{cite news|author=Power Slam Staff|title=Power Slam|work=This Month in History: February|publisher=SW Publishing |id=55|page=28|date=January 1999}}</ref> [[Ken Wayne (wrestler)|Ken Wayne]] and [[Karl Moffat|Jason The Terrible]] found Gilbert in his apartment. His father, [[Tommy Gilbert]], stated that injuries to Eddie's chest and heart muscle had occurred in a serious car crash in 1983 and could have been a factor; Eddie's alleged use of painkillers since the accident could also have contributed to his heart condition. The [[Eddie Gilbert Memorial Brawl]] was held in his memory from 1996 to 1999.\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\n[[File:Gilbert and Candido HHoF.jpg|thumb|Gilbert's [[2300 Arena#Hardcore Hall of Fame|Hardcore Hall of Fame]] banner in the former [[Asylum Arena|ECW Arena]].]] Notice the date of death listed as 2007 instead of 1995.\n*'''[[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]]'''\n**[[NWA Central States Tag Team Championship]] ([[NWA Central States Tag Team Championship#Title History (1979 -

He spent several months recovering before returning to the ring; upon his return, he stated on television that WWF Champion [[Bob Backlund]] had been a tremendous inspiration to him. Gilbert continued wrestling for the WWF until 1984.<ref name=\"Lentz2015\"/>\n\n===Mid-Southern Wrestling (1984\u20131986)===\nLater, he began making a name for himself as Eddie Gilbert in CWA in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He teamed with his father and [[Ricky Morton]] in those years. In addition, he formed a team with [[Tommy Rich]] as \"Fargo's Fabulous Ones\", an attempt by Mid-Southern (Memphis) to bury and still cash in on the fame attained by the previous incarnation of the [[Fabulous Ones]], [[Steve Keirn]] and [[Stan Lane]], who walked out of the territory after a dispute. They held the AWA Southern Tag Team titles in 1984 until dropping them to Phil Hickerson and the Spoiler (Frank Morrell). The duo would break up soon after, with Gilbert turning heel. The two had a brief but intense feud, which memorably began on television when the two were presented with a \"Tag Team of the Year\" award by announcer [[Lance Russell]] and two guests. Gilbert, unaware his former partner was at the taping, badmouthed Rich, then the International Heavyweight Champion, until Rich came out to confront him. Rich immediately got the upper hand, running Gibert into the steel ringpost several times, bloodying him in the process before the cameras went to a commercial. After the commercial break, Gilbert told Russell he wanted Rich to come back out so he could apologize to him in person, stating he was wrong for still being bitter about the break-up of the team, and was fueled by jealousy of Rich's championship title reign and new found star status. When Rich accepted Gilbert's apology, Gilbert suddenly turned on him and, in front of a stunned audience and a speechless Russell, rammed Rich's head into the ringpost, just as Rich had done to him moments earlier. Gilbert then made his way to Bill Watts' Mid-South territory.\n\n===Universal Wrestling Federation (1986-1987)===\nIn 1986, Gilbert went to work for Bill Watts at [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], Eddie added the \"Hot Stuff\" to his name. He started a heel stable of wrestlers called \"Hot Stuff International, Inc.\" and he managed it and wrestled. His stable included [[Steve Borden|Sting]], [[Jim Hellwig|Ultimate Warrior]] and [[Rick Steiner]] before they were stars. He was always a ladies' man and he stole [[Missy Hyatt]] from [[John Tatum (wrestler)|John Tatum]] in 1987, with his stable being renamed \"H & H International, Inc.\" He married Hyatt in 1988. [[Iceman Parsons]] and [[Dick Murdoch]] would also join his stable later on at different times as well. Sting would eventually leave \"Hot Stuff International, Inc.\" and feud with them.\n\nEddie also worked as a booker, who came up with the famous ''Battle of New Orleans'' angle in late-1987 involving Chris Adams, Terry Taylor, Sting, and himself.  Following a match in which Taylor defeated [[Shane Douglas]] due to interference by both Gilbert and [[Rick Steiner]], Adams told referee [[Randy Anderson]] of the interference.  As Adams pleaded his case with Anderson, Gilbert and Taylor attacked him, and Sting eventually evened the sides.  The angle eventually spilled outside the ring into the stands, and near the concession area, featuring a huge brawl involving beer kegs, chairs, trash cans, tables, popcorn machines and other objects. Gilbert was awarded [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Best Booker|Best Booker of 1988]] by the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]''. He would stay with the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] until the Purchase from [[Jim Crockett Promotions]]\n\n===Continental Wrestling Federation (1988)===\nFrom there, Gilbert worked in Alabama's [[Continental Wrestling Federation]] (CWF), where he reformed Hot Stuff Inc. Gilbert also served as booker, with [[Paul Heyman]] as his assistant. The CWF was broadcast nationally on the [[Financial News Network]], and Gilbert's creative work was widely praised by wrestling journalists.<ref>[http://www.eddiegilbert.com/profile1.html Profile of Eddie Gilbert], part 1. EddieGilbert.com</ref> However, Gilbert left due to conflicts with management.\n\n===Jim Crockett Promotions / NWA World Championship Wrestling (1988\u20131989)===\nGilbert went to the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]]'s [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) -- which had purchased the UWF\u2014and brought Hyatt, Heyman and his brother [[Doug Gilbert]] with him. Eddie teamed with Rick Steiner to feud with [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and his [[The Varsity Club|Varsity Club]]. He also became involved in a feud with [[Ric Flair]] and [[Barry Windham]] in which he teamed with [[Ricky Steamboat]] and [[Lex Luger]]. Near the end of his stint there, JCP was renamed [[World Championship Wrestling]], and Gilbert was featured in the first [[World Championship Wrestling (video game)|WCW video game]].\n\n===USWA and various promotions (1989\u20131995)===\nEddie left WCW in late 1989 and also divorced Hyatt. He went back to [[Independent circuit|the independents]] where he could book again. He worked for the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA) in Memphis (where he feuded with Jerry Lawler)<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/88 88]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/88}}</ref> and the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] (GWF), as well as Philadelphia's Tri-State Wrestling Alliance promotion. Gilbert also married [[Debrah Miceli|Madusa]] at this time after having hit it off with Madusa on TWA promoter Joel Goodhart's radio show, but the marriage was brief.\n\nGilbert's most famous feud in the Memphis territory involved an angle between himself and Lawler in 1990. Eddie and his brother [[Doug Gilbert|Doug]] were \"[[Kayfabe#\"You're fired!\" and \"I quit!\"|fired]]\" from the promotion, and in retaliation hit Lawler with their car and fled the scene. Numerous home viewers, fearing for Lawler, immediately called the police to report what they had just seen as a legitimate vehicular [[assault]]. Lawler had to inform the police what was going on and Lawler was forced to appear on television (while [[Sell (professional wrestling)|selling]] his \"injuries\") sooner than intended out of concern that Gilbert would have been legitimately arrested if he didn't show on TV that he was all right.\n\nGilbert quit the USWA in January 1991. The on air story was that he had chose to leave the promotion rather than be injured by [[Jim Cornette]], [[Stan Lane]], and [[Steve Keirn]].<ref name=211991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/january-21-1991-wrestling-observer-newsletter-ric-flair-defeats-sting|title=January 21, 1991 Wrestling Observer Newsletter: Ric Flair defeats Sting for his 7th World title win, more|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=January 21, 1991|accessdate=September 4, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nDue to a pay dispute, Gilbert, along with his brother Doug (who wrestled under a mask as the [[Dark Patriot]]) left the GWF in 1992. Eddie Gilbert took with him the [[GWF North American Heavyweight Championship]] belt. He made a few defenses of the title in the USWA as the GWF World Heavyweight champion, despite being stripped of the belt and not being recognized as such by the GWF.\n\nHe wrestled in (and booked) the successor to Tri-State Wrestling.\n\nGilbert then returned to the USWA until early 1995 when he worked one night for [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] before traveling to [[World Wrestling Council]] in [[Puerto Rico]] to wrestle and book.\n\n===Eastern Championship Wrestling (1993)===\nIn 1993 he wrestled for NWA [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]], where he again teamed with Doug. He also served as head booker, but gave up his position in September 1993 to Paul Heyman, who eventually took the company national under the name Extreme Championship Wrestling. He would have a feud with [[Terry Funk]].\n\n===Looking For Mr. Gilbert Shoot Interview===\nIn early 1994, Gilbert sat down with Bob Barnett and conducted a filmed [[shoot interview]] titled \"Looking For Mr. Gilbert.\" Gilbert spoke openly about his life and career at a time when professional wrestlers rarely appeared on film out of character and almost never spoke publicly about the behind-the-scenes machinations of the wrestling business. The footage from the interview was later marketed on home video and sold through wrestling newsletters, as well as at independent wrestling shows, the first of its kind. \"Looking For Mr. Gilbert\" is now considered the first professional wrestling \"shoot video\", and in the decades since, countless professional wrestlers have conducted sit-down shoot interviews, most notably in RF Video's Shoot Interview series and Kayfabe Commentaries' YouShoot interview series.\n\n==Personal life==\nGilbert married wrestling valet [[Missy Hyatt]] in October 1987. The couple divorced in 1989. Gilbert was also briefly married to [[Debrah Miceli|Debrah \"Madusa\" Miceli]] in 1992.\n\n==Death==\nOn February 18, 1995, Gilbert died of a heart attack in his apartment in [[Isla Verde, Puerto Rico]].<ref name=\"PS55\">{{cite news|author=Power Slam Staff|title=Power Slam|work=This Month in History: February|publisher=SW Publishing |id=55|page=28|date=January 1999}}</ref> [[Ken Wayne (wrestler)|Ken Wayne]] and [[Karl Moffat|Jason The Terrible]] found Gilbert in his apartment. His father, [[Tommy Gilbert]], stated that injuries to Eddie's chest and heart muscle had occurred in a serious car crash in 1983 and could have been a factor; Eddie's alleged use of painkillers since the accident could also have contributed to his heart condition. The [[Eddie Gilbert Memorial Brawl]] was held in his memory from 1996 to 1999.\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\n[[File:Gilbert and Candido HHoF.jpg|thumb|Gilbert's [[2300 Arena#Hardcore Hall of Fame|Hardcore Hall of Fame]] banner in the former [[Asylum Arena|ECW Arena]].]] Notice the date of death listed as 2007 instead of 1995.\n*'''[[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]]'''\n**[[NWA Central States Tag Team Championship]] ([[NWA Central States Tag Team Championship#Title History (1979 -

National elections were only five months away, and Paredes appeared to be the leading presidential contender. Nevertheless, in early September, President [[Ricardo de la Espriella|de la Espriella]] purged his cabinet of Paredes loyalists, and [[Manuel Antonio Noriega|Noriega]] declared that he would not publicly support any candidate for president. These events convinced Paredes that he had no official government or military backing for his candidacy. He withdrew from the presidential race on 6 September 1983, less than a month after retiring from the Guard. Although Paredes subsequently gained the support of the [[Popular Nationalist Party]] (PNP) and was able to appear on the 1984 ballot, he was no longer a major presidential contender. Constitutional reforms notwithstanding, the reality of Panamanian politics dictated that no candidate could become president without the backing of the [[Military of Panama|National Guard]] and, especially, its commander.<ref>Black, Jan Knippers and Edmundo Flores. \"Historical setting.\" Meditz, Sandra W. 1989.

D\u00edaz Herrera\u2019s act was the first public manifestation of a breach. In the face of the Panamanian Defense Forces\u2019s demonstrated weakness, the political sector began to mobilize and call for a confrontation with the military. Following the leadership of groups that appeared to have little political experience, they formed the \u2018Cruzada Civilista\u2019 for the purpose of overthrowing the Eric Arturo Delvalle government and convening a \u2018constituyente\u2019 assembly to draw up a new constitution''\".<ref>Gand\u00e1segui, Marco A. \"The military regimes of Panama.\" Journal of interamerican studies and world affairs 35, 3:1-18 (fall 1993).

The crisis came to a head in June 1987 when Colonel Roberto D\u00edaz Herrera, recently retired head of the Panamanian Defense Forces High Command, denounced the internal management of General Noriega\u2019s military organization. D\u00edaz Herrera\u2019s act was the first public manifestation of a breach. In the face of the Panamanian Defense Forces\u2019s demonstrated weakness, the political sector began to mobilize and call for a confrontation with the military. Following the leadership of groups that appeared to have little political experience, they formed the \u2018Cruzada Civilista\u2019 for the purpose of overthrowing the Eric Arturo Delvalle government and convening a \u2018constituyente\u2019 assembly to draw up a new constitution''\".<ref>Gand\u00e1segui, Marco A. \"The military regimes of Panama.\" Journal of interamerican studies and world affairs 35, 3:1-18 (fall 1993).

In 2011, there were over 100 million Chinese MMO gamers.\n\nOfficial Chinese statistics regarding online gaming state that as of the close of 2006 revenue from China's online gaming industry reached 8 billion RMB or around 1.04 billion US dollars, with earnings reaching around 33 billion RMB or 4.3 billion US dollars.

The first is peak concurrent users (PCU), which is the maximum numbers of players online simultaneously at a given time.  A high PCU number signifies that a game has a large base of constant user participation, which is essential for the survival of an online world.  The second statistic used is the daily active player base; this number is essentially a count of the number of disparate users who sign on in a given 24-hour period.  This statistic differs from PCU simply because of its longer time span but the daily user base is still a good quantifier of popularity and usage.\n\nThe third statistic is simply the total number of registered users for a specific game or service, this statistic is significantly more problematic because most, if not all, online games do not limit the user to a single account or user name.  For example, some games claim millions of registered users; a disingenuous statistic given that the most popular MMORPGs in China usually garner only 800,000 to one million peak concurrent users.<ref>Gamasutra.[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13369 \"The China Angle\"]. April 3, 2007.</ref>  Thus, while registered user numbers can be quite impressive, they are not as accurate a gauge of popularity as the other aforementioned statistics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}{{Original research inline|date=March 2008}}\n\n===Investment===\nIn 2010, there were 25 investments made into Chinese online gaming companies.

The company is significant because it introduced a new online payment system with the release of [[Legend of Mir 2]] in 2001.  Instead of charging users for the initial purchase of the game, Shanda gave the software away free-of-charge and decided to charge users for time spent playing in game.  This payment system specifically counteracted piracy because the company could maintain easier control over the time users spent in the game, rather than attempt to limit the game's distribution.<ref>Gamasutra.[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13170 \"The China Angle\"].

In 2011, there were over 100 million Chinese MMO gamers.\n\nOfficial Chinese statistics regarding online gaming state that as of the close of 2006 revenue from China's online gaming industry reached 8 billion RMB or around 1.04 billion US dollars, with earnings reaching around 33 billion RMB or 4.3 billion US dollars.

The first is peak concurrent users (PCU), which is the maximum numbers of players online simultaneously at a given time.  A high PCU number signifies that a game has a large base of constant user participation, which is essential for the survival of an online world.  The second statistic used is the daily active player base; this number is essentially a count of the number of disparate users who sign on in a given 24-hour period.  This statistic differs from PCU simply because of its longer time span but the daily user base is still a good quantifier of popularity and usage.\n\nThe third statistic is simply the total number of registered users for a specific game or service, this statistic is significantly more problematic because most, if not all, online games do not limit the user to a single account or user name.  For example, some games claim millions of registered users; a disingenuous statistic given that the most popular MMORPGs in China usually garner only 800,000 to one million peak concurrent users.<ref>Gamasutra.[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13369 \"The China Angle\"].

The company is significant because it introduced a new online payment system with the release of [[Legend of Mir 2]] in 2001.  Instead of charging users for the initial purchase of the game, Shanda gave the software away free-of-charge and decided to charge users for time spent playing in game.  This payment system specifically counteracted piracy because the company could maintain easier control over the time users spent in the game, rather than attempt to limit the game\u2019s distribution.<ref>Gamasutra.[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13170 \"The China Angle\"].

Others mocked her (including her younger sister, Angelina, who apparently used to make fun of Galgani during such experiences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stgemmagalgani.com/2009/12/st-gemmas-reaction-to-unkindness.html|title=St Gemma's reaction to unkindness -forgiveness|date=December 2009|website=stgemmagalgani.com|accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> and during Galgani's canonization process was deemed as \"unfit\" to testify due to accusations of attempting to profit from Galgani's reputation). In light of the extraordinary events surrounding her life, some skeptics thought that she had a mental illness.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Death, canonization and devotion==\nIn early 1903, Galgani was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and went into a long and often painful decline accompanied by several mystical phenomena. One of the religious nursing sisters who attended to her stated, \"We have cared for a good many sick people, but we have never seen anything like this.\" At the beginning of Holy Week 1903, her health quickly deteriorated, and by [[Good Friday]] she was suffering tremendously, dying in a small room across from the Giannini house on 11 April 1903, [[Holy Saturday]]. After a thorough examination of her life by the Church, she was [[beatification|beatified]] on 14 May 1933 and canonized on 2 May 1940.<ref name=\"sgg-46\">Saint Gemma, p. 46.</ref> Galgani's relics are housed at the [[Sanctuary of Santa Gemma, Lucca|Sanctuary of Santa Gemma]] associated with the Passionist [[monastery]] in Lucca, Italy. Since 1985, her heart is housed in the Santuario de Santa Gema, in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stgemmagalgani.com/2009/07/devotion-to-st-gemma-galgani-around.html|title=Devotion to St Gemma Galgani around the world|website=www.stgemmagalgani.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref> Gemma Galgani's confessor Germano Ruoppolo, who significantly influenced her, wrote a book about her.<ref>Germanus, Venerable Father (2000).
