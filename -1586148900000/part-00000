While sailing near modern day Point Roberts, Galiano encountered the Britsh expedition led by Captain [[George Vancouver]]<ref>Kendrick, John (1990). ''The Voyage of'' Sutil ''and'' Mexicana'', 1792: The last Spanish exploration of the Northwest Coast of America''. Spokane, Washington: The Arthur H. Clark Company. pp. 43, 51\u201352, 208\u2013209. </ref>. The two exchanged maps and parted ways on friendly terms, despite the somewhat hostile  [[Nootka Crisis|relations between their mother countries]]. Galiano then proceeded to circumnavigate Vancouver Island, confirming it to indeed be an island, and returned to Mexico shortly after to report his findings. He would later die at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nWhen news of the discovery of gold on the British Columbia mainland reached [[San Francisco]] in 1858, nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] became an important port for miners on their way to the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush|Fraser Canyon gold fields]]. Due to increased interest and in the area, the Royal Navy hydrographer Captain [[George Henry Richards]] was tasked with mapping the area around Galiano Island in 1859, and decided to name the island in honour of the Spanish navigator who had visited the region 67 years prior<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn the early years of European settlement the island\u2019s primary industries were fishing and logging. Poor soil on the island limited the development of widespread agriculture found on other Gulf Islands, such as nearby Saltspring. Early settlement included a pioneer farming community on the shores of \u201cPlumper Pass\u201d (later renamed Active Pass). Other settlers, such as Scotty Georgeson (a Shetland Islander who married a Fraser Valley Sto:lo woman), also held land and had family on Galiano in this early period<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nBeginning in the 1870s a small number of Asian immigrants, particularly Japanese, also decided to settle the area for its abundance of fish stock and timber. These Japanese immigrants, primarily from [[Wakayama prefecture]], brought with them methods of charcoal production, who\u2019s evidence can still be found on the island today<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/pit-kiln/|title=Japanese Charcoal Pit Kiln|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Many of these Japanese settlers continued to operate salteries on the North end of the island until the outbreak of [[internment of Japanese Canadians|war with Japan]].\n\nFollowing confederation of British Columbia into Canada in 1871 and the subsequent the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, the nearby Lower Mainland exploded in population. By 1928 this had spilled over, and the small community on Galiano had grown large enough to construct the Galiano Community hall, which is still in use today<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://galianomuseum.ca/new/pages/2004020022.htm|title=Dance at the Hall|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. In the 1960s logging rights for much of the island were given to [[MacMillan Bloedel]] for resource extraction<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://galianostory.com/OVERVIEW.HTM|title=The Story of Galiano Island: across thirty important years|last=Griffiths|first=Margaret|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Many environmentally conscious residents objected to the widespread logging, leading to many disputes including ''MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Galiano Island Trust Committee'' in 1995<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ca.vlex.com/vid/macmillan-v-galiano-island-681204801|title=Macmillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Galiano Island Trust Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Enviromentalism and the 1960s counter-culture continue to heavily influence the culture of the island to this day. In 2006 the riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands, to which Galiano is a part, elected Canada's first [[Green Party of Canada|Green]] member of parliament, [[Elizabeth May]].\n\nAs of the 21st century, the logging industry has all but halted on the island, replaced by industries such as tourism and a local art scene.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Arbutus Tree (7743626674).jpg|thumb|left|[[Arbutus menziesii|Arbutus tree]] in Montague Provincial Park]]\n[[File:Roca Seta.JPG|thumb|Sandstone formation on the west coast of Galiano]]\n\nLocated on the western edge of the [[Salish Sea]], Galiano is a long, narrow island, {{convert|27.5|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} in length and {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} at its narrowest point.\n\nMount Galiano is Galiano\u2019s highest point, rising 311 metres (1020 feet) above sea level. The summit provides hikers with views over the Gulf Islands, the U.S. San Juan Islands and the distant mainland mountains as well. Just west of Mt. Galiano is Sutil Mountain, an Ecological Reserve 290 meters (951 feet) above sea level, named after Capt. Galiano's flagship. \n\nThe western coast of the island (facing [[Trincomali Channel]]) is characterized by its unique sandstone formations and caves. \n\n===Ecology===\n\nDue to its mild climate, Galiano Island is home to a large variety of animals and plants. In a major flight path for migrating birds, Galiano has hundreds of bird species,<ref>{{cite web | title=Galiano Island Check List | website=iNaturalist.ca | date=2009-07-29 | url=https://inaturalist.ca/check_lists/288913-Galiano-Island-Check-List?iconic_taxon=3 | ref={{sfnref | iNaturalist.ca | 2009}} | access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> such as [[bald eagle]]s, [[heron]]s and [[cormorant]]s. Off its shores are resident and transient populations of [[Killer whale|orca whales]], [[Harbor seal|seals]], [[Sea otter|otters]], [[Steller sea lion|sea lions]] as well as many other varieties of sea life. The island is also home to a large population of deer.\n\nMany native tree species such as [[arbutus menziesii|Arbutus trees]], [[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]] and [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coastal douglas fir]] thrive on the island and can be found in abundance. While most of the Island has been logged in the years since European settlement, limited old growth forests still exist, for example on the southern side Bluffs Park <ref>{{Cite report |url=https://galianoconservancy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/final_report_complete.pdf|title=Galiano Island Landscape Classification and Up-close Workshop Series Final Report |first=Kate |last=Emmings |first2=Keith |last2=Erickson |date=June 2004 |publisher=Galiano Conservancy Association}}</ref>.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe climate of Galiano Island is classified as [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate|Warm-Summer Medditeranean (Csb)]] under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system which is characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Similar to the other [[Southern Gulf Islands|Gulf Islands]], the [[rain shadow]] effect of the [[Olympic Mountains|Olympic]] and [[Vancouver Island Ranges|Vancouver Island mountains]], and the moderating effects of the ocean, are the dominant influences on the climate of Galiano Island. The combined effects of low precipitation, warm temperatures, and high number of sunshine hours often result in an annual moisture deficit on Galiano Island from mid-June to early October. This deficit can often reach drought conditions in areas of recent clearcuts and can result in an extreme forest fire hazard in the summer months<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.islandstrustconservancy.ca/media/64549/itfmgmtplanvanillaleafland.pdf|title=Vanilla Leaf Land Nature Reserve (DL 58) Galiano Island Management Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Galiano Island]]\n|metric first = 1\n|single line = 1\n|Jan high C = 6.3\n|Feb high C = 8.1\n|Mar high C = 10.1\n|Apr high C = 13.0\n|May high C = 16.4\n|Jun high C = 19.4\n|Jul high C = 21.9\n|Aug high C = 21.8\n|Sep high C = 18.8\n|Oct high C = 13.9\n|Nov high C = 9.5\n|Dec high C = 6.6\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 3.4\n|Feb mean C = 4.6\n|Mar mean C = 6.1\n|Apr mean C = 8.5\n|May mean C = 11.5\n|Jun mean C = 14.5\n|Jul mean C = 16.5\n|Aug mean C = 16.4\n|Sep mean C = 13.8\n|Oct mean C = 9.8\n|Nov mean C = 6.2\n|Dec mean C = 3.7\n|year mean C = 9.6\n|Jan low C = 0.5\n|Feb low C = 1.1\n|Mar low C = 2.1\n|Apr low C = 4.1\n|May low C = 6.7\n|Jun low C = 9.6\n|Jul low C = 11.2\n|Aug low C = 11.1\n|Sep low C = 8.9\n|Oct low C = 5.8\n|Nov low C = 2.9\n|Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 153\n|Feb precipitation mm = 112\n|Mar precipitation mm = 90\n|Apr precipitation mm = 59\n|May precipitation mm = 45\n|Jun precipitation mm = 36\n|Jul precipitation mm = 24\n|Aug precipitation mm = 29\n|Sep precipitation mm = 47\n|Oct precipitation mm = 98\n|Nov precipitation mm = 165\n|Dec precipitation mm = 162\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = climate-data.org\n}}\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Salish Orca at Sturdies Bay, Galiano Island.jpg|thumb|left|top|Sturdies Bay, the BC Ferries terminal]]\nGaliano Island is accessible by vehicle via the [[BC Ferries]] terminal at [[Sturdies Bay]], located on [[Active Pass]]. Vehicle and passenger ferry service runs from [[Tsawwassen ferry terminal|Tsawwassen]] ([[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]) on the mainland and [[Swartz Bay]] ([[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]) on Vancouver Island most days of the year. Additionally, there are numerous inter-island ferries that connect the Gulf Islands, which are scheduled less frequently.\n\nMoorage is available at several public wharves for boat traffic: Sturdies Bay, (walking distance to the Village), Montague Harbour, Whalers Bay and Retreat Cove. Private moorage is available at Montague Harbour Marina and the Galiano Oceanfront Inn (Sturdies Bay). Limited water taxi service to nearby islands like Saltspring is also availible out of Sturdies Bay and Montague Harbour.\n\nDaily, regularly scheduled floatplane service is offered from Downtown Vancouver and the Vancouver International Airport through [[Seair Seaplanes]] to Montague Harbour. There is regularly scheduled floatplane service from Seattle daily through [[Kenmore Air]], either through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Kenmore Air Harbor and Seattle Lake Union.\n\nOnce on the Island, most areas can be accessed by paved road, however some logging roads remain in use in the less traveled sections of the Island.\n\n== Parks ==\nGaliano is home to many popular public parks like Montague Harbour and Dionisio as well as privately owned parks such as Tapovan Peace Park.\n\n[[File:MontagueHarbourBoats.jpg|thumb|right|View from Shell Beach at Montague Harbour Provincial Park]]\n[[File:Orcas and Seals at Dionisio.jpg|thumb|Orcas and Seals at Dionisio Provincial Park]]\n\n*[[Montague Harbour Marine Provincial Park]] is one of the most popular parks in the Gulf Islands.  It is unique for its Shell Beach, which is a west-facing beach with worn shells covering the whole expanse of the beach instead of sand. For thousands of years, it was the location of a midden used by Coast Salish people.<ref>{{cite web | title=Galiano Island | website=The Canadian Encyclopedia | date=2014-01-23 | url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/galiano-island | ref={{sfnref | The Canadian Encyclopedia | 2014}} | access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>. Montague Harbour is popular with the recreational boating community; the harbour is often crowded with [[yacht]]s and [[sailboat]]s during the warmer months of June, July, and August.  The Park's mooring buoys are in limited supply and cannot be reserved, but the harbour is well sheltered if one chooses to anchor.  A marina with moorage, gas dock, several small stores, and a cafe (summer only) is located at the southern end of the harbour.  A public dock is near the marina.\n\n*[[Dionisio Point Provincial Park]] is a boat-access only, rugged natural park at the north end of the island with beautiful beaches that the local islanders call Coon Bay. Here you will find a unique shoreline with sandstone formations, a sandy beach for swimming, tidal pools, colourful wildflowers, and forests that fill this beautiful provincial park. \n\n*[http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/bluffs-park/ Bluffs Park] is Galiano's oldest wilderness park, established by community subscription in 1948. With {{convert|130|ha|acres|abbr=on}}, it extends far inland into virgin forest, as well having high cliffs and a long sandy beach.\n\n*[http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/mount-galiano/ Mount Galiano] is Galiano\u2019s highest point.

Galiano's flagship]].\n\n*[[Collinson Point Provincial Park]] is essentially the shoreline of Mount Galiano, and is important in protecting the marine life of the approaches to Active Pass.\n\n*[[Bodega Ridge Provincial Park]] consists of a ridge that rises over 240 metres above sea level, with views over many of the Gulf Islands' hundreds of islands and islets and beyond to the mountains of the Olympic Peninsula. High cliffs are home to raptors like peregrine falcons and bald eagles, as well as trees like [[Thuja plicata|cedars]] and [[Douglas fir]].\n\n*Tapovan Peace Park is a [[Tapovan]] of some 200 acres in the middle of the Island, dedicated to [[Sri Chinmoy]]. It features many hiking trails named by the word \"peace\", each in a different language, and a veritable stairway to heaven ascending the high cliff.\n\n*[https://www.crd.bc.ca/project/past-capital-projects-and-initiatives/matthews-point-management-plan Matthews Point Park] is a 25-hectare [[Capital Regional District]] Park that preserves over a kilometre of waterfront on [[Active Pass]], of which 300 metres are broad sandy beach. It was named after a pioneer family whose descendants in England later contributed towards the Park purchase. There is also a hiking loop along the clifftops.<ref>CRD, Matthews Point Management Plan https://www.crd.bc.ca/docs/default-source/parks-pdf/matthews-point-management-plan-2018.pdf?sfvrsn=1c13f6ca_4</ref> It adjoins and is connected to [http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/bluffs-park/ Bluffs Park].\n\n*The [http://conservancy.bc.ca/trincomali-nature-sanctuary/ Trincomali Nature Sanctuary] is an area of sheer cliffs that has been set aside by the [[Islands Trust]] for the preservation of [[Double-crested cormorants]] and [[Peregrine Falcons]], among other species.\n\n==Government==\nGovernment bodies that oversee the island include [[Government of Canada|Federal]], [[Politics of British Columbia|Provincial]] and the [[Capital Regional District]] as well as the Islands Trust whose mandate is to establish land-use bylaws to \"preserve and protect\" the island, most notably in terms of development. For most of the twentieth century roughly half of the land on Galiano was owned by the logging firm [[MacMillan Bloedel]]. As a result, Galiano was not as extensively developed as neighboring islands. When the firm sold its holdings on Galiano, debate about development issues sharpened, and the Islands Trust set minimum lot sizes to limit development.\n\nLocal elections are held every three years to determine who will be the island's two Trustees.\n\nThere is one Indian Reserve on the island, Galiano Indian Reserve No. 9, located at the northern tip of the island operating under Penelakut administration.<ref>{{cite bcgnis|33539|Galiano Indian Reserve 9}}</ref><ref>[http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/fnp/Main/Search/RVDetail.aspx?RESERVE_NUMBER=06825&lang=eng Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Reserve/Settlement/Village Detail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515214525/http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/fnp/Main/Search/RVDetail.aspx?RESERVE_NUMBER=06825&lang=eng |date=2012-05-15 }}</ref>.\n\n== Tourism ==\nDue to the minimal development of Galiano, tourism on the island has remained limited and sustainable. There are two proper hotels and several cabin resorts, but most accommodation comes in the form of Bed and Breakfasts, the Montague Provincial Park Campsite or holiday rentals. Activities on Galiano Island include hiking, boating, visiting art galleries, golfing and exploring beaches, as well as frequent musical events.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThe powerline [[HVDC Vancouver-Island]] crosses Galiano Island in southwestly direction as overhead powerline section, which ends at a cable terminal on [[Parker Island]].\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Brett Gaylor]]\n*[[Iona Campagnolo]]\n*[[Jane Rule]]\n*[[Audrey Thomas]]\n*[[Marie Clements]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:MontagueHarbourCliffside.jpg|Montague Harbour sunset\nFile:Mount Galiano 2.jpg|View from Mt.

[[Midden pits]] at Montague Harbour suggest at least 3000 years of habitation<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://galianomuseum.ca/history.htm|title=Galiano Island: A Historical Sketch|website=galianomuseum.ca|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>. In the late 1770s, before Europeans had even arrived in the area, the small pox epidemic reached the Coast Salish region, killing as much as 30% of region's original population<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/smallpox|title=Smallpox in Canada|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Subsequent outbreaks would reduce the First Nations population even further over the following century.\n\nIn 1792, Spanish navigator Dionisio Galiano was dispatched by the Spanish crown to seek out the rumoured [[Northwest Passage]]. After returning from Nootka sound, Galiano and his two vessels, ''[[Sutil (ship)|Sutil]]'' and ''Mexicana'', entered the Straight of Juan de Fuca later that year. While sailing near modern day Point Roberts, Galiano encountered the Britsh expedition led by Captain [[George Vancouver]]<ref>Kendrick, John (1990). ''The Voyage of'' Sutil ''and'' Mexicana'', 1792: The last Spanish exploration of the Northwest Coast of America''. Spokane, Washington: The Arthur H. Clark Company. pp. 43, 51\u201352, 208\u2013209. </ref>. The two exchanged maps and parted ways on friendly terms, despite the somewhat hostile  [[Nootka Crisis|relations between their mother countries]]. Galiano then proceeded to circumnavigate Vancouver Island, confirming it to indeed be an island, and returned to Mexico shortly after to report his findings. He would later die at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nWhen news of the discovery of gold on the British Columbia mainland reached [[San Francisco]] in 1858, nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] became an important port for miners on their way to the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush|Fraser Canyon gold fields]]. Due to increased interest and in the area, the Royal Navy hydrographer Captain [[George Henry Richards]] was tasked with mapping the area around Galiano Island in 1859, and decided to name the island in honour of the Spanish navigator who had visited the region 67 years prior<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn the early years of European settlement the island\u2019s primary industries were fishing and logging. Poor soil on the island limited the development of widespread agriculture found on other Gulf Islands, such as nearby Saltspring. Early settlement included a pioneer farming community on the shores of \u201cPlumper Pass\u201d (later renamed Active Pass). Other settlers, such as Scotty Georgeson (a Shetland Islander who married a Fraser Valley Sto:lo woman), also held land and had family on Galiano in this early period<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nBeginning in the 1870s a small number of Asian immigrants, particularly Japanese, also decided to settle the area for its abundance of fish stock and timber. These Japanese immigrants, primarily from [[Wakayama prefecture]], brought with them methods of charcoal production, who\u2019s evidence can still be found on the island today<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/pit-kiln/|title=Japanese Charcoal Pit Kiln|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Many of these Japanese settlers continued to operate salteries on the North end of the island until the outbreak of [[internment of Japanese Canadians|war with Japan]].\n\nFollowing confederation of British Columbia into Canada in 1871 and the subsequent the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, the nearby Lower Mainland exploded in population. By 1928 this had spilled over, and the small community on Galiano had grown large enough to construct the Galiano Community hall, which is still in use today<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://galianomuseum.ca/new/pages/2004020022.htm|title=Dance at the Hall|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. In the 1960s logging rights for much of the island were given to [[MacMillan Bloedel]] for resource extraction<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://galianostory.com/OVERVIEW.HTM|title=The Story of Galiano Island: across thirty important years|last=Griffiths|first=Margaret|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Many environmentally conscious residents objected to the widespread logging, leading to many disputes including ''MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Galiano Island Trust Committee'' in 1995<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ca.vlex.com/vid/macmillan-v-galiano-island-681204801|title=Macmillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Galiano Island Trust Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Enviromentalism and the 1960s counter-culture continue to heavily influence the culture of the island to this day. In 2006 the riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands, to which Galiano is a part, elected Canada's first [[Green Party of Canada|Green]] member of parliament, [[Elizabeth May]].\n\nAs of the 21st century, the logging industry has all but halted on the island, replaced by industries such as tourism and a local art scene.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Arbutus Tree (7743626674).jpg|thumb|left|[[Arbutus menziesii|Arbutus tree]] in Montague Provincial Park]]\n[[File:Roca Seta.JPG|thumb|Sandstone formation on the west coast of Galiano]]\n\nLocated on the western edge of the [[Salish Sea]], Galiano is a long, narrow island, {{convert|27.5|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} in length and {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} at its narrowest point.\n\nMount Galiano is Galiano\u2019s highest point, rising 311 metres (1020 feet) above sea level. The summit provides hikers with views over the Gulf Islands, the U.S. San Juan Islands and the distant mainland mountains as well. Just west of Mt. Galiano is Sutil Mountain, an Ecological Reserve 290 meters (951 feet) above sea level, named after Capt. Galiano's flagship. \n\nThe western coast of the island (facing [[Trincomali Channel]]) is characterized by its unique sandstone formations and caves. \n\n===Ecology===\n\nDue to its mild climate, Galiano Island is home to a large variety of animals and plants. In a major flight path for migrating birds, Galiano has hundreds of bird species,<ref>{{cite web | title=Galiano Island Check List | website=iNaturalist.ca | date=2009-07-29 | url=https://inaturalist.ca/check_lists/288913-Galiano-Island-Check-List?iconic_taxon=3 | ref={{sfnref | iNaturalist.ca | 2009}} | access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> such as [[bald eagle]]s, [[heron]]s and [[cormorant]]s. Off its shores are resident and transient populations of [[Killer whale|orca whales]], [[Harbor seal|seals]], [[Sea otter|otters]], [[Steller sea lion|sea lions]] as well as many other varieties of sea life. The island is also home to a large population of deer.\n\nMany native tree species such as [[arbutus menziesii|Arbutus trees]], [[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]] and [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coastal douglas fir]] thrive on the island and can be found in abundance. While most of the Island has been logged in the years since European settlement, limited old growth forests still exist, for example on the southern side Bluffs Park <ref>{{Cite report |url=https://galianoconservancy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/final_report_complete.pdf|title=Galiano Island Landscape Classification and Up-close Workshop Series Final Report |first=Kate |last=Emmings |first2=Keith |last2=Erickson |date=June 2004 |publisher=Galiano Conservancy Association}}</ref>.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe climate of Galiano Island is classified as [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate|Warm-Summer Medditeranean (Csb)]] under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system which is characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Similar to the other [[Southern Gulf Islands|Gulf Islands]], the [[rain shadow]] effect of the [[Olympic Mountains|Olympic]] and [[Vancouver Island Ranges|Vancouver Island mountains]], and the moderating effects of the ocean, are the dominant influences on the climate of Galiano Island. The combined effects of low precipitation, warm temperatures, and high number of sunshine hours often result in an annual moisture deficit on Galiano Island from mid-June to early October. This deficit can often reach drought conditions in areas of recent clearcuts and can result in an extreme forest fire hazard in the summer months<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.islandstrustconservancy.ca/media/64549/itfmgmtplanvanillaleafland.pdf|title=Vanilla Leaf Land Nature Reserve (DL 58) Galiano Island Management Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Galiano Island]]\n|metric first = 1\n|single line = 1\n|Jan high C = 6.3\n|Feb high C = 8.1\n|Mar high C = 10.1\n|Apr high C = 13.0\n|May high C = 16.4\n|Jun high C = 19.4\n|Jul high C = 21.9\n|Aug high C = 21.8\n|Sep high C = 18.8\n|Oct high C = 13.9\n|Nov high C = 9.5\n|Dec high C = 6.6\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 3.4\n|Feb mean C = 4.6\n|Mar mean C = 6.1\n|Apr mean C = 8.5\n|May mean C = 11.5\n|Jun mean C = 14.5\n|Jul mean C = 16.5\n|Aug mean C = 16.4\n|Sep mean C = 13.8\n|Oct mean C = 9.8\n|Nov mean C = 6.2\n|Dec mean C = 3.7\n|year mean C = 9.6\n|Jan low C = 0.5\n|Feb low C = 1.1\n|Mar low C = 2.1\n|Apr low C = 4.1\n|May low C = 6.7\n|Jun low C = 9.6\n|Jul low C = 11.2\n|Aug low C = 11.1\n|Sep low C = 8.9\n|Oct low C = 5.8\n|Nov low C = 2.9\n|Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 153\n|Feb precipitation mm = 112\n|Mar precipitation mm = 90\n|Apr precipitation mm = 59\n|May precipitation mm = 45\n|Jun precipitation mm = 36\n|Jul precipitation mm = 24\n|Aug precipitation mm = 29\n|Sep precipitation mm = 47\n|Oct precipitation mm = 98\n|Nov precipitation mm = 165\n|Dec precipitation mm = 162\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = climate-data.org\n}}\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Salish Orca at Sturdies Bay, Galiano Island.jpg|thumb|left|top|Sturdies Bay, the BC Ferries terminal]]\nGaliano Island is accessible by vehicle via the [[BC Ferries]] terminal at [[Sturdies Bay]], located on [[Active Pass]]. Vehicle and passenger ferry service runs from [[Tsawwassen ferry terminal|Tsawwassen]] ([[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]) on the mainland and [[Swartz Bay]] ([[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]) on Vancouver Island most days of the year. Additionally, there are numerous inter-island ferries that connect the Gulf Islands, which are scheduled less frequently.\n\nMoorage is available at several public wharves for boat traffic: Sturdies Bay, (walking distance to the Village), Montague Harbour, Whalers Bay and Retreat Cove. Private moorage is available at Montague Harbour Marina and the Galiano Oceanfront Inn (Sturdies Bay). Limited water taxi service to nearby islands like Saltspring is also availible out of Sturdies Bay and Montague Harbour.\n\nDaily, regularly scheduled floatplane service is offered from Downtown Vancouver and the Vancouver International Airport through [[Seair Seaplanes]] to Montague Harbour. There is regularly scheduled floatplane service from Seattle daily through [[Kenmore Air]], either through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Kenmore Air Harbor and Seattle Lake Union.\n\nOnce on the Island, most areas can be accessed by paved road, however some logging roads remain in use in the less traveled sections of the Island.\n\n== Parks ==\nGaliano is home to many popular public parks like Montague Harbour and Dionisio as well as privately owned parks such as Tapovan Peace Park.\n\n[[File:MontagueHarbourBoats.jpg|thumb|right|View from Shell Beach at Montague Harbour Provincial Park]]\n[[File:Orcas and Seals at Dionisio.jpg|thumb|Orcas and Seals at Dionisio Provincial Park]]\n\n*[[Montague Harbour Marine Provincial Park]] is one of the most popular parks in the Gulf Islands.  It is unique for its Shell Beach, which is a west-facing beach with worn shells covering the whole expanse of the beach instead of sand. For thousands of years, it was the location of a midden used by Coast Salish people.<ref>{{cite web | title=Galiano Island | website=The Canadian Encyclopedia | date=2014-01-23 | url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/galiano-island | ref={{sfnref | The Canadian Encyclopedia | 2014}} | access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>. Montague Harbour is popular with the recreational boating community; the harbour is often crowded with [[yacht]]s and [[sailboat]]s during the warmer months of June, July, and August.  The Park's mooring buoys are in limited supply and cannot be reserved, but the harbour is well sheltered if one chooses to anchor.  A marina with moorage, gas dock, several small stores, and a cafe (summer only) is located at the southern end of the harbour.  A public dock is near the marina.\n\n*[[Dionisio Point Provincial Park]] is a boat-access only, rugged natural park at the north end of the island with beautiful beaches that the local islanders call Coon Bay. Here you will find a unique shoreline with sandstone formations, a sandy beach for swimming, tidal pools, colourful wildflowers, and forests that fill this beautiful provincial park. \n\n*[http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/bluffs-park/ Bluffs Park] is Galiano's oldest wilderness park, established by community subscription in 1948. With {{convert|130|ha|acres|abbr=on}}, it extends far inland into virgin forest, as well having high cliffs and a long sandy beach.\n\n*[http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/mount-galiano/ Mount Galiano] is Galiano\u2019s highest point. It rises 314 meters (1030 feet) above sea level.

Galiano's flagship]].\n\n*[[Collinson Point Provincial Park]] is essentially the shoreline of Mount Galiano, and is important in protecting the marine life of the approaches to Active Pass.\n\n*[[Bodega Ridge Provincial Park]] consists of a ridge that rises over 240 metres above sea level, with views over many of the Gulf Islands' hundreds of islands and islets and beyond to the mountains of the Olympic Peninsula. High cliffs are home to raptors like peregrine falcons and bald eagles, as well as trees like [[Thuja plicata|cedars]] and [[Douglas fir]].\n\n*Tapovan Peace Park is a [[Tapovan]] of some 200 acres in the middle of the Island, dedicated to [[Sri Chinmoy]]. It features many hiking trails named by the word \"peace\", each in a different language, and a veritable stairway to heaven ascending the high cliff.\n\n*[https://www.crd.bc.ca/project/past-capital-projects-and-initiatives/matthews-point-management-plan Matthews Point Park] is a 25-hectare [[Capital Regional District]] Park that preserves over a kilometre of waterfront on [[Active Pass]], of which 300 metres are broad sandy beach. It was named after a pioneer family whose descendants in England later contributed towards the Park purchase. There is also a hiking loop along the clifftops.<ref>CRD, Matthews Point Management Plan https://www.crd.bc.ca/docs/default-source/parks-pdf/matthews-point-management-plan-2018.pdf?sfvrsn=1c13f6ca_4</ref> It adjoins and is connected to [http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/bluffs-park/ Bluffs Park].\n\n*The [http://conservancy.bc.ca/trincomali-nature-sanctuary/ Trincomali Nature Sanctuary] is an area of sheer cliffs that has been set aside by the [[Islands Trust]] for the preservation of [[Double-crested cormorants]] and [[Peregrine Falcons]], among other species.\n\n==Government==\nGovernment bodies that oversee the island include [[Government of Canada|Federal]], [[Politics of British Columbia|Provincial]] and the [[Capital Regional District]] as well as the Islands Trust whose mandate is to establish land-use bylaws to \"preserve and protect\" the island, most notably in terms of development. For most of the twentieth century roughly half of the land on Galiano was owned by the logging firm [[MacMillan Bloedel]]. As a result, Galiano was not as extensively developed as neighboring islands. When the firm sold its holdings on Galiano, debate about development issues sharpened, and the Islands Trust set minimum lot sizes to limit development.\n\nLocal elections are held every three years to determine who will be the island's two Trustees.\n\nThere is one Indian Reserve on the island, Galiano Indian Reserve No. 9, located at the northern tip of the island operating under Penelakut administration.<ref>{{cite bcgnis|33539|Galiano Indian Reserve 9}}</ref><ref>[http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/fnp/Main/Search/RVDetail.aspx?RESERVE_NUMBER=06825&lang=eng Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Reserve/Settlement/Village Detail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515214525/http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/fnp/Main/Search/RVDetail.aspx?RESERVE_NUMBER=06825&lang=eng |date=2012-05-15 }}</ref>.\n\n== Tourism ==\nDue to the minimal development of Galiano, tourism on the island has remained limited and sustainable. There are two proper hotels and several cabin resorts, but most accommodation comes in the form of Bed and Breakfasts, the Montague Provincial Park Campsite or holiday rentals. Activities on Galiano Island include hiking, boating, visiting art galleries, golfing and exploring beaches, as well as frequent musical events.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThe powerline [[HVDC Vancouver-Island]] crosses Galiano Island in southwestly direction as overhead powerline section, which ends at a cable terminal on [[Parker Island]].\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Brett Gaylor]]\n*[[Iona Campagnolo]]\n*[[Jane Rule]]\n*[[Audrey Thomas]]\n*[[Marie Clements]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:MontagueHarbourCliffside.jpg|Montague Harbour with Parker and Saltspring in the background\nFile:Mount Galiano 2.jpg|View from Mt.

Drug cinema ranges from the ultra-realistic to the utterly surreal; some films are unabashedly pro- or anti-drug, while others are less judgmental. The drugs most commonly shown in films are [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[LSD]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (see [[stoner film]]) and [[methamphetamine]].\n\nThere is extensive overlap with crime films, which are more likely to treat drugs as plot devices to keep the action moving.\n\nThe following is a partial list of drug films and the substances involved.\n\n{{Compact ToC |center=yes |num=yes}}\n\n== 0\u20139 ==\n* ''[[1.

Drug cinema ranges from the ultra-realistic to the utterly surreal; some films are unabashedly pro- or anti-drug, while others are less judgmental. The drugs most commonly shown in films are [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[LSD]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (see [[stoner film]]) and [[methamphetamine]].\n\nThere is extensive overlap with crime films, which are more likely to treat drugs as plot devices to keep the action moving.\n\nThe following is a partial list of drug films and the substances involved.\n\n{{Compact ToC |center=yes |num=yes}}\n\n== 0\u20139 ==\n* ''[[1.

Middle East.\u201d The map, entitled \u201cHow 5 Could Become 14,\u201d shows a hypothetical future division of Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia into 14 potential new countries along with two additional city-states. I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia. This sparked anger among Yemenis, and a group of Yemeni activists founded the \"Asir Movement\" in order to reclaim the provinces of Asir, Najran, and Jizan, which Yemen conceded in the 2000 [[Treaty of Jeddah (2000)|Treaty of Jeddah]]. A \"[[Human rights|rights]] organization which has worked to denounce Saudi Arabia\u2019s abuses in northern Yemen\",<ref name=PressTV>{{cite news|title=Yemen's Houthis standing ground against Saudi Arabia |url= http://www.presstv.com/detail/2014/02/07/349604/houthis-stand-ground-against-s-arabia |work=Press TV| date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> the Asir Movement described itself as a \u201ccivil popular\u201d movement that seeks to raise \"internal Yemeni awareness\" about the situation and to explore legal remedies against Saudi Arabia \"for their involvement and assistance in abdicating Yemen\u2019s historical right to its territories\", all while emphasizing Yemeni unity.

Although the DPP has been the nominal ruling party of the Republic of China throughout these four ruling terms, the DPP has been pushing a pro-Taiwan independence agenda, whether tacitly or overtly. Some representatives of the DPP, such as [[William Lai]], argue that Taiwan independence should not even be considered an \"independence movement\" but is rather the recognition of the reality of the current situation of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]]. Many supporters of Taiwan independence believe that Taiwan, under the formal name of the \"Republic of China\", is already an independent country from China, under the formal name of the \"People's Republic of China\".\n***Political parties: [[Pan-Green Coalition]] ([[Democratic Progressive Party]], [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], [[Taiwan Independence Party]]), [[New Power Party]], [[Taiwan Statebuilding Party]]\n***Advocacy groups: Keep Taiwan Free (Taiwanese organisation), [[World United Formosans for Independence]]\n***Claimed territories: Taiwan (Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, Taiwan-Penghu, Taoyuan)\n***Area of claimed territories: Roughly 36,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of claimed territories: Roughly 24,000,000 people\n{{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}} '''[[Kinmen|Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan)]] (Kinmen)''' \u2014 Independence movement{{See also|Kinmen|Taiwan independence movement#The issue of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang)}}\n\n* Ethnic group: Kinmenese people, [[Taiwanese people]]\n**Proposed unification with a proposed state: {{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}}[[File:Flag of World Taiwanese Congress.svg|22px|border]] Kinmen County, Republic of Taiwan\n***Movement: Kinmen-Taiwan unification movement, [[Taiwan independence movement]], [[Taiwanese nationalism]]\n****Note: [[Kinmen]] is currently ruled by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]], so it and Taiwan are ''de facto'' already united. However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country.

Kinmen is viewed by the Chinese (PRC) government as a place where Chinese (re)unification experiments can be conducted, in preparation for the ultimate goal of annexing the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]]. The Kinmen County government has frequently clashed with the [[Mainland Affairs Council|Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]] (which oversees relations with the PRC) over its willingness to allow the Chinese (PRC) government to infiltrate its society, economy, politics, cultural institutions, religious institutions, educational institutions, and local communities. It is unknown what percentage of Kinmenese society supports this movement but it is known that the Kinmen County government supports this movement and that it has been actively pushing for Kinmen's annexation into China (PRC).\n*** Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under the ROC'''\n\n{{See also|Three Principles of the People|Project National Glory|Communist bandit}}\n\nThis is a variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement that advocates for the ROC to become the ruling regime of China again, replacing the PRC.

It advocates for the (re)unification of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC) under a hypothetical \"New China\". Proponents of this movement believe that both the PRC and the ROC have expired and that the only logical solution that is fair to both parties is to overthrow both regimes and replace them with a single \"New China\" regime that possesses characteristics of both the PRC and the ROC, as well as its own unique traits. Visions for such a \"New China\" range from a \"[[dictatorship]]\" to a \"[[democracy]]\".

Middle East.\u201d The map, entitled \u201cHow 5 Could Become 14,\u201d shows a hypothetical future division of Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia into 14 potential new countries along with two additional city-states. I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia. This sparked anger among Yemenis, and a group of Yemeni activists founded the \"Asir Movement\" in order to reclaim the provinces of Asir, Najran, and Jizan, which Yemen conceded in the 2000 [[Treaty of Jeddah (2000)|Treaty of Jeddah]].

Although the DPP has been the nominal ruling party of the Republic of China throughout these four ruling terms, the DPP has been pushing a pro-Taiwan independence agenda, whether tacitly or overtly. Some representatives of the DPP, such as [[William Lai]], argue that Taiwan independence should not even be considered an \"independence movement\" but is rather the recognition of the reality of the current situation of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]].

However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country.

The Kinmen County government has frequently clashed with the [[Mainland Affairs Council|Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]] (which oversees relations with the PRC) over its willingness to allow the Chinese (PRC) government to infiltrate its society, economy, politics, cultural institutions, religious institutions, educational institutions, and local communities. It is unknown what percentage of Kinmenese society supports this movement but it is known that the Kinmen County government supports this movement and that it has been actively pushing for Kinmen's annexation into China (PRC).\n*** Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under the ROC'''\n\n{{See also|Three Principles of the People|Project National Glory|Communist bandit}}\n\nThis is a variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement that advocates for the ROC to become the ruling regime of China again, replacing the PRC.

It advocates for the (re)unification of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC) under a hypothetical \"New China\". Proponents of this movement believe that both the PRC and the ROC have expired and that the only logical solution that is fair to both parties is to overthrow both regimes and replace them with a single \"New China\" regime that possesses characteristics of both the PRC and the ROC, as well as its own unique traits. Visions for such a \"New China\" range from a \"[[dictatorship]]\" to a \"[[democracy]]\".

Notably, the majority opinion found all judges are independent, not just superior court judges and inferior court judges concerned with criminal law, as the written constitution stipulates.  Unwritten constitutional principles were relied upon to demonstrate this, indicating such principles were growing in importance in constitutional interpretation.  The reference also remains one of the most definitive statements on the extent to which all judges in [[Canada]] are protected by the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]].\n\nThe majority opinion established that independent compensation commissions are required to help set salaries free of political manipulation.  These commissions, described by the majority as \"an institutional sieve\"<ref>Lamer C.J., para. 170.</ref> and by the dissent as \"a virtual [[fourth branch of government]]\", make recommendations that governments may deviate from only with rational explanations.  However, the reference has been subject to harsh published criticisms.\n\n==Background==\nThe reference was the amalgamation of three different sets of challenges to the impartiality and independence of provincial court judges in [[Manitoba]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Alberta]]. The powers of the provincial legislatures to reduce the salaries of the provincial court judges was challenged as a violation of [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11(d)]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which gives an accused the right to be [[presumption of innocence|presumed innocent]] until proven guilty \"in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal\".\n\nIn Prince Edward Island and Manitoba, the salaries of judges were lowered along with those of other [[civil servants]] to help combat [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]s.  In Prince Edward Island, various challenges of the judges' consequent independence were raised by defendants, causing the government to bring two reference questions to its Supreme Court.  Only one reference resulted in a finding of dependence, namely for lack of adequate security of tenure.  In Manitoba, the pay cut was challenged directly by a provincial judges association.  Meanwhile, in Alberta, cuts to judicial salaries were challenged by defendants.  Concerns in Alberta were also raised by [[Premier of Alberta|Alberta Premier]] [[Ralph Klein]] saying on the radio that a certain judge should be \"very, very quickly fired\". The judge had threatened to simply stop working due to his belief that his salary was insufficient.<ref>Lamer, para. 19.</ref>  (The Supreme Court only briefly addressed this, saying Klein's words were \"unfortunate and reflect a misunderstanding of the theory and practice of judicial independence in Canada\".<ref>Lamer, para. 286.</ref>)\n\n==Opinion of the Court==\n[[Antonio Lamer|Lamer]] C.J. with L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci JJ, allowed the appeals in part, stating that there was constitutional protection of judicial independence and impartiality for all judges.\n\nOne problem identified was that the independence of provincial judges was not protected as extensively as the federal judges were under sections 96 to 100 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]].  The majority read section 11(d) as only protecting independence in the exercise of jurisdiction in relation to offence (i.e., it would protect judges concerned with criminal law, but not [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]). However, section 11(d) is not a broad or exhaustive code. Instead, the Court looked to constitutional norms and found that judicial independence was one such norm implied by the [[preamble]] to the Constitution.  Although Lamer recognized case law such as the [[Patriation Reference]] which noted the preamble technically has no binding effect in itself, he also found the preamble reveals the \"basic principles which are the very source of the substantive provisions of the Constitution Act, 1867\" and \"invites the use of those organizing principles to fill out gaps in the express terms of the constitutional scheme\".<ref>Lamer C.J., para. 94\u201395.</ref> The implication of the importance of judicial independence came from the preamble's statement that Canada's constitution should be similar to the [[United Kingdom]]'s, and the UK has a tradition of judicial independence. The [[Act of Settlement of 1701]] was particularly important for independence. The Supreme Court had previously reached this conclusion in ''[[Beauregard v. Canada]]'' (1986).<ref>Lamer, para. 105.</ref> However, the Court now claimed that since courts are more important today, judicial independence has become a fundamental issue that should not just be reserved for the superior courts, as dictated by the Act of Settlement. The Constitution could adapt to changing circumstances in this regard. (This interpretation of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]] has inspired criticism. The British form of judicial independence was more limited in 1867, neither extending to inferior courts nor limiting government power to lower the judges' remuneration. At any rate, no act of Parliament can be declared ''[[ultra vires]]'' by a court in British law. This is why academic [[Jeffrey Goldsworthy]] attacked the decision as \"a self-contradiction, a vague reference to 'evolution' combined with a plainly false analogy, and an evasion\".<ref>Goldsworthy, Jeffrey. \"The Preamble, Judicial Independence and Judicial Integrity.\" ''FORUM Constitutionnel'' (2000) 11:2.</ref>)\n\nThe Court turned back to examine section 11(d) and from precedent, namely ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'', identified three fundamental requirements of judicial independence: 1) security of tenure, 2) financial security, and 3) some administrative independence. As well, judicial independence can be divided into two types of independence: 1) individual independence belonging to a judge and 2) institutional independence of a court as a whole. A judge must also be reasonably seen as being independent. It is possible, Lamer found, to interpret each of the three requirements in light of the two types of independence; this case, in particular, would explore how financial security belongs to both a judge and the court as a whole. This discussion would go beyond ''Valente'', since that decision only treated financial security as a matter of individual independence.<ref>Lamer, para. 119\u2013121.</ref>\n\nThe Court emphasized that the role of institutional independence has become expected of provincial courts due to their increased role in dispute resolution in the country. As a previous judicial independence case, ''Beauregard'', had demonstrated, institutional independence was needed so that courts could guard the Constitution, the [[rule of law]] and [[fundamental justice]].<ref>Lamer, para. 123.</ref>  This required more [[separation of powers]]; whereas judicial independence has normally been understood to protect the judiciary from the executive, the Court now found the judiciary should be free of manipulation from the legislative branch.<ref>Lamer, para. 125.</ref>  Provincial courts should benefit from this independence, as demonstrated by their handling of important cases such as ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.]]'' in 1983.<ref>Lamer, para. 127.</ref>\n\nFor these reasons, it was strongly suggested that the government establish judicial salary commissions, thus overruling ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in the previous landmark judicial independence case, ''Valente v. The Queen'', which had found such commissions were desirable but not necessary. In this case, it was noted commissions could guard against manipulation by both the executive ''and'' legislatures.  If remuneration of provincial judges is to be raised, lowered or kept the same, this may be done along with the remuneration of other government employees or with the judges' alone. The continued independence of judges, however, will be kept apparent in any of these circumstances if it involves review by an \"independent, effective, and objective\" body, i.e. the salary commissions.  While salary recommendations of these commissions should not be binding, they should be taken seriously. Any government rejection of a recommendation will have to be justified and may be challenged in a court.<ref>Lamer, para. 133.</ref> However, the justification need not be scrutinized to the extent that a government decision will be scrutinized under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Instead, governments must only show their rejections are rational, and rationality can be measured in the way it was measured by the Supreme Court in ''[[Reference re Anti-Inflation Act]]'' (1976).<ref>Lamer, para. 182\u2013183.</ref>\n\nAnother benefit for having salary commissions was that it eliminated direct salary negotiations between the government and judges. Such direct negotiations would naturally raise concerns about what exactly is being negotiated.  Namely, there was a concern that governments could manipulate judges to make decisions in certain ways.<ref>Lamer, para. 134.</ref> In order to ensure the government would not deliberately let judges' salaries fall below the cost of living, in relation to [[inflation]], it was also decided that the commissions should meet regularly, for example once every three to five years.<ref>Lamer, para. 147.</ref>\n\nSince judicial independence is guaranteed by the preamble, civil law judges have a right to these salary commissions, even though they have no rights under section 11(d).\n\nTurning to the facts of the case, the Supreme Court faulted the governments of Prince Edward Island and Alberta for neither consulting salary commissions nor having such bodies to begin with. For this reason, the actions of these governments breached section 11(d) of the Charter of Rights.<ref>Lamer, para. 200, 217.</ref>  Manitoba did have a salary commission, but its actions were unconstitutional because the provincial government did not use it.<ref>Lamer para. 224.</ref> Since these considerations were made using section 11(d), the Court considered whether violations of these rights could be justified under section 1 of the Charter of Rights, as is normal procedure. Section 1 typically requires a valid government reason for violating rights, and in this case Prince Edward Island and Alberta's actions failed the section 1 test because they did not explain why they did not have salary commissions. Likewise, Manitoba did not explain why they did not use their salary commission.<ref>Lamer, para. 278\u2013280.</ref>  An academic commentator has suggested the section 1 analysis was actually unneeded since the right to a commission is based in the preamble, which is not subject to section 1; the analysis was thus \"a first year law school mistake\".<ref>Kahana, Tsvi. \"The Constitution as a Collective Agreement: Remuneration of Provincial Court Judges in Canada\", (2004) 29 Queen's L.J., page 487.</ref>\n\n==Dissent==\nLa Forest J., alone in dissent, rejected the majority's finding of an unwritten constitutional principle that protects a right to judicial salary commissions. He was very wary of the \"discovery\" of such new principles, especially when some protection of judges can already be found elsewhere in the text of the Constitution, namely section 11(d), which was the subject of this case. The counsel had primarily relied on section 11(d) and only briefly spoke of unwritten rules.<ref>La Forest, para. 297.</ref> La Forest also suggested that section 11(d) granting independence only to inferior criminal law judges, and not inferior civil law judges, was deliberate, because \"Being accused of a crime is one of the most momentous encounters an individual can have with the power of the state.\"<ref>La Forest, para. 298.</ref>\n\nLa Forest went on to caution that \"judicial power\" is limited so that a court \"does not initiate matters and has no agenda of its own\".<ref>La Forest, para. 300.</ref> This made him worried about the majority launching into an extensive, unneeded discussion on unwritten principles.<ref>La Forest, para. 302.</ref> He accepted unwritten principles exist, but disputed that limits on government decisions can be found in the preamble. There was no tradition guarding judicial independence against Parliament.<ref>La Forest, para. 305.</ref> [[Parliamentary supremacy]] remained important in Britain even after the Act of Settlement; thus British courts cannot invalidate a law, even if the law is generally thought to be wrong.<ref>La Forest, para. 309.</ref> La Forest acknowledged this could be seen as a \"technical quibble\" since courts in Canada can invalidate laws, but he went on to point out that the Act of Settlement only covered superior judges, and not inferior judges.<ref>La Forest, para. 312\u2013313.</ref>  He also said courts should have clearer grounds for limiting legislative actions, casting previous decisions such as ''[[Switzman v. Elbling]]'' (1957), which relied on the [[Implied Bill of Rights]], into doubt. He pointed to ''[[Attorney General for Canada and Dupond v. Montreal]]'' (1978) as a prior Supreme Court decision questioning the Implied Bill of Rights.<ref>La Forest, para. 316-317.</ref> If an implied bill of rights existed, it should be found in the creation of Parliament, in section 17 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and should allow for Parliamentary supremacy instead of limiting it.<ref>La Forest, para. 318.</ref>\n\nIn this case, La Forest pointed to ''Valente'' and ''[[R. v. Lipp\u00e9]]'' to show section 11(d) does not guarantee a type of independence that is most favourable to judges.<ref>La Forest, para. 330.</ref> The conclusion in ''Valente'' that judicial compensation committees were not needed was therefore valid; section 11(d) left room for determining what methods can be used to achieve independence. In this case, judges' salaries were lowered along with those of other government employees, and this did not seem to raise reasonable concerns about judicial independence.<ref>La Forest, para. 334\u2013337.</ref> As a judicial compensation commission likely should not have a problem with this, as acknowledged by Lamer, La Forest found the requirement that the commission look into the matter to be \"a triumph of form over substance\".<ref>La Forest, para. 343.</ref>\n\nLa Forest also felt requiring such commissions was also \"tantamount to enacting a new constitutional provision to extend the protection provided by s. 11(d)\" by forcing the creation of \"what in some respects is a virtual fourth branch of government to police the interaction between the political branches and the judiciary\".  Judges simply asking whether government decisions seem reasonable would be enough.<ref>La Forest, para. 344.</ref>\n\n==Rehearing==\n{{main|Re Remuneration of Judges (No. 2)}}\nThe 1997 Reference caused numerous challenges regarding the creation of compensation committees.  Some governments needed more time to establish and consult them.  Moreover, by finding provincial courts were not independent because salary commissions were not used, the Reference seemed to imply criminal law decisions by provincial courts were invalid under section 11(d), since defendants were not tried before independent tribunals.  Consequently, the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island turned to the Court again.  In ''[[Re Remuneration of Judges (No. 2)]]'' (1998), Lamer for a unanimous court decided that necessity dictated that dependent provincial courts be deemed acceptable for the time being.  Also as a result of the second decision, the requirement for commissions did not become binding until September 18, 1998.\n\n==Aftermath==\nNotably, the reference had the effect of damaging the reputation of the judicial system. The outcome affecting remuneration has been seen as being motivated by greed. As one academic wrote, the judiciary's \"integrity has been tarnished by the perception of self-interest and [[bias]]\". This author also claimed that a resulting 35% raise for federal judges has led to burdensome [[tax]]es.<ref>LeRoy, Sylvia, \"Judicial Independence and the Integrity of the Judiciary\", ''Fraser Forum'', August 2004. Page 3.</ref> Another scholar wrote that the reference \"demonstrates that judges can be audacious, greedy and jealous\". This scholar said judges' [[standard of living]] prior to the reference was already good, and that provincial judges only seemed to want the same pay as federal judges.<ref>Kahana, page 448.</ref>\n\nScholars have offered various specific critiques for the majority opinion. Among these was that it was self-contradictory. The request that government reasons should be rational and legitimate seemed to ask for two separate things, namely reasonableness and correctness. Rationality allows for government reasons to be accepted if they are not overly flawed, even if courts disagree with them. Legitimacy, meanwhile, implies government decisions should be correct, i.e., consistent with commission recommendations.<ref>Kahana, 452.</ref> Professor [[Peter Hogg]] objected to the notion that governments and judges cannot directly negotiate. He wrote that \"It assumes that there is a real possibility that judges would violate their oath of office and decide cases wrongly (for example, by convicting an innocent person or imposing an unduly harsh penalty) in order to obtain some (highly speculative and likely trivial) advantage at the negotiating table.\"<ref>Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 188.</ref>\n\nHogg also felt the Reference made it increasingly unlikely that judges' salaries can be lowered.  In terms of case law, he pointed to ''[[Mackin v. New Brunswick]]'' (2002) as a case that, after the 1997 Reference, \"reinforced and even extended\" the notion that lowering judges' salaries could be unconstitutional.<ref>Hogg, page 187.</ref>\n\nAfter the Reference, all provinces had salary commissions. The Reference also inspired the federal government under [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] to establish a salary commission for federal judges, the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]].<ref>F.L. Morton and Ranier Knopff, ''The Charter Revolution & the Court Party'', (Toronto: Broadview Press, 2000), page 109.</ref> Still, the ''Provincial Judges Reference'' sparked further litigation as some provincial government's decisions not to follow commissions' salary recommendations were challenged in the courts. The Supreme Court addressed the matter again in 2005 in ''[[Provincial Court Judges' Assn. of New Brunswick v. New Brunswick (Minister of Justice)]]'' and urged courts to be deferential when governments give sufficient reasons for rejecting salary commissions' recommendations.\n\nSome scholars also expressed concern that the reference set a precedent for enforcing unwritten rules. This could lead to even wider grounds for [[judicial review]].<ref>LeRoy, 4.</ref> The study of unwritten rules is also said to have surfaced in the Supreme Court decisions ''[[New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)]]'' (1993) and ''[[Reference re Secession of Quebec]]'' (1998), and one scholar called it a \"very old and venerable\" feature of [[common law]].<ref>Walters, Mark D. \"The Common Law Constitution in Canada:  Return of ''Lex Non Scripta'' as Fundamental Law.\"  The University of Toronto Law Journal, Vol. 51, No. 2. (Spring 2001), page 91.</ref> Conversely, one critic, who claimed the 1997 Reference represented the first time that the unwritten constitution was used to invalidate a statute in Canada,<ref>Leclair, Jean.  \"Canada's Unfathomable Unwritten Constitutional Principles\", 27 Queen's L.J. 2002. page 391.</ref> said that courts had consequently grown \"bolder in their law-creating enterprise\"<ref>Leclair, 392.</ref> and that \"If law requires certainty, unwritten principles are bound to create problems.\"<ref>Leclair, 400.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Lamer Court)]]\n* ''[[Mackeigan v.

The Constitution could adapt to changing circumstances in this regard. (This interpretation of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]] has inspired criticism. The British form of judicial independence was more limited in 1867, neither extending to inferior courts nor limiting government power to lower the judges' remuneration. At any rate, no act of Parliament can be declared ''[[ultra vires]]'' by a court in British law. This is why academic [[Jeffrey Goldsworthy]] attacked the decision as \"a self-contradiction, a vague reference to 'evolution' combined with a plainly false analogy, and an evasion\".<ref>Goldsworthy, Jeffrey. \"The Preamble, Judicial Independence and Judicial Integrity.\" ''FORUM Constitutionnel'' (2000) 11:2.</ref>)\n\nThe Court turned back to examine section 11(d) and from precedent, namely ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'', identified three fundamental requirements of judicial independence: 1) security of tenure, 2) financial security, and 3) some administrative independence. As well, judicial independence can be divided into two types of independence: 1) individual independence belonging to a judge and 2) institutional independence of a court as a whole. A judge must also be reasonably seen as being independent. It is possible, Lamer found, to interpret each of the three requirements in light of the two types of independence; this case, in particular, would explore how financial security belongs to both a judge and the court as a whole. This discussion would go beyond ''Valente'', since that decision only treated financial security as a matter of individual independence.<ref>Lamer, para. 119\u2013121.</ref>\n\nThe Court emphasized that the role of institutional independence has become expected of provincial courts due to their increased role in dispute resolution in the country. As a previous judicial independence case, ''Beauregard'', had demonstrated, institutional independence was needed so that courts could guard the Constitution, the [[rule of law]] and [[fundamental justice]].<ref>Lamer, para. 123.</ref>  This required more [[separation of powers]]; whereas judicial independence has normally been understood to protect the judiciary from the executive, the Court now found the judiciary should be free of manipulation from the legislative branch.<ref>Lamer, para. 125.</ref>  Provincial courts should benefit from this independence, as demonstrated by their handling of important cases such as ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.]]'' in 1983.<ref>Lamer, para. 127.</ref>\n\nFor these reasons, it was strongly suggested that the government establish judicial salary commissions, thus overruling ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in the previous landmark judicial independence case, ''Valente v. The Queen'', which had found such commissions were desirable but not necessary. In this case, it was noted commissions could guard against manipulation by both the executive ''and'' legislatures.  If remuneration of provincial judges is to be raised, lowered or kept the same, this may be done along with the remuneration of other government employees or with the judges' alone. The continued independence of judges, however, will be kept apparent in any of these circumstances if it involves review by an \"independent, effective, and objective\" body, i.e. the salary commissions.  While salary recommendations of these commissions should not be binding, they should be taken seriously. Any government rejection of a recommendation will have to be justified and may be challenged in a court.<ref>Lamer, para. 133.</ref> However, the justification need not be scrutinized to the extent that a government decision will be scrutinized under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Instead, governments must only show their rejections are rational, and rationality can be measured in the way it was measured by the Supreme Court in ''[[Reference re Anti-Inflation Act]]'' (1976).<ref>Lamer, para. 182\u2013183.</ref>\n\nAnother benefit for having salary commissions was that it eliminated direct salary negotiations between the government and judges. Such direct negotiations would naturally raise concerns about what exactly is being negotiated.  Namely, there was a concern that governments could manipulate judges to make decisions in certain ways.<ref>Lamer, para. 134.</ref> In order to ensure the government would not deliberately let judges' salaries fall below the cost of living, in relation to [[inflation]], it was also decided that the commissions should meet regularly, for example once every three to five years.<ref>Lamer, para. 147.</ref>\n\nSince judicial independence is guaranteed by the preamble, civil law judges have a right to these salary commissions, even though they have no rights under section 11(d).\n\nTurning to the facts of the case, the Supreme Court faulted the governments of Prince Edward Island and Alberta for neither consulting salary commissions nor having such bodies to begin with. For this reason, the actions of these governments breached section 11(d) of the Charter of Rights.<ref>Lamer, para. 200, 217.</ref>  Manitoba did have a salary commission, but its actions were unconstitutional because the provincial government did not use it.<ref>Lamer para. 224.</ref> Since these considerations were made using section 11(d), the Court considered whether violations of these rights could be justified under section 1 of the Charter of Rights, as is normal procedure. Section 1 typically requires a valid government reason for violating rights, and in this case Prince Edward Island and Alberta's actions failed the section 1 test because they did not explain why they did not have salary commissions. Likewise, Manitoba did not explain why they did not use their salary commission.<ref>Lamer, para. 278\u2013280.</ref>  An academic commentator has suggested the section 1 analysis was actually unneeded since the right to a commission is based in the preamble, which is not subject to section 1; the analysis was thus \"a first year law school mistake\".<ref>Kahana, Tsvi. \"The Constitution as a Collective Agreement: Remuneration of Provincial Court Judges in Canada\", (2004) 29 Queen's L.J., page 487.</ref>\n\n==Dissent==\nLa Forest J., alone in dissent, rejected the majority's finding of an unwritten constitutional principle that protects a right to judicial salary commissions. He was very wary of the \"discovery\" of such new principles, especially when some protection of judges can already be found elsewhere in the text of the Constitution, namely section 11(d), which was the subject of this case. The counsel had primarily relied on section 11(d) and only briefly spoke of unwritten rules.<ref>La Forest, para. 297.</ref> La Forest also suggested that section 11(d) granting independence only to inferior criminal law judges, and not inferior civil law judges, was deliberate, because \"Being accused of a crime is one of the most momentous encounters an individual can have with the power of the state.\"<ref>La Forest, para. 298.</ref>\n\nLa Forest went on to caution that \"judicial power\" is limited so that a court \"does not initiate matters and has no agenda of its own\".<ref>La Forest, para. 300.</ref> This made him worried about the majority launching into an extensive, unneeded discussion on unwritten principles.<ref>La Forest, para. 302.</ref> He accepted unwritten principles exist, but disputed that limits on government decisions can be found in the preamble. There was no tradition guarding judicial independence against Parliament.<ref>La Forest, para. 305.</ref> [[Parliamentary supremacy]] remained important in Britain even after the Act of Settlement; thus British courts cannot invalidate a law, even if the law is generally thought to be wrong.<ref>La Forest, para. 309.</ref> La Forest acknowledged this could be seen as a \"technical quibble\" since courts in Canada can invalidate laws, but he went on to point out that the Act of Settlement only covered superior judges, and not inferior judges.<ref>La Forest, para. 312\u2013313.</ref>  He also said courts should have clearer grounds for limiting legislative actions, casting previous decisions such as ''[[Switzman v. Elbling]]'' (1957), which relied on the [[Implied Bill of Rights]], into doubt. He pointed to ''[[Attorney General for Canada and Dupond v. Montreal]]'' (1978) as a prior Supreme Court decision questioning the Implied Bill of Rights.<ref>La Forest, para. 316-317.</ref> If an implied bill of rights existed, it should be found in the creation of Parliament, in section 17 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and should allow for Parliamentary supremacy instead of limiting it.<ref>La Forest, para. 318.</ref>\n\nIn this case, La Forest pointed to ''Valente'' and ''[[R. v. Lipp\u00e9]]'' to show section 11(d) does not guarantee a type of independence that is most favourable to judges.<ref>La Forest, para. 330.</ref> The conclusion in ''Valente'' that judicial compensation committees were not needed was therefore valid; section 11(d) left room for determining what methods can be used to achieve independence. In this case, judges' salaries were lowered along with those of other government employees, and this did not seem to raise reasonable concerns about judicial independence.<ref>La Forest, para. 334\u2013337.</ref> As a judicial compensation commission likely should not have a problem with this, as acknowledged by Lamer, La Forest found the requirement that the commission look into the matter to be \"a triumph of form over substance\".<ref>La Forest, para. 343.</ref>\n\nLa Forest also felt requiring such commissions was also \"tantamount to enacting a new constitutional provision to extend the protection provided by s. 11(d)\" by forcing the creation of \"what in some respects is a virtual fourth branch of government to police the interaction between the political branches and the judiciary\".  Judges simply asking whether government decisions seem reasonable would be enough.<ref>La Forest, para. 344.</ref>\n\n==Rehearing==\n{{main|Re Remuneration of Judges (No. 2)}}\nThe 1997 Reference caused numerous challenges regarding the creation of compensation committees.  Some governments needed more time to establish and consult them.  Moreover, by finding provincial courts were not independent because salary commissions were not used, the Reference seemed to imply criminal law decisions by provincial courts were invalid under section 11(d), since defendants were not tried before independent tribunals.  Consequently, the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island turned to the Court again.  In ''[[Re Remuneration of Judges (No. 2)]]'' (1998), Lamer for a unanimous court decided that necessity dictated that dependent provincial courts be deemed acceptable for the time being.  Also as a result of the second decision, the requirement for commissions did not become binding until September 18, 1998.\n\n==Aftermath==\nNotably, the reference had the effect of damaging the reputation of the judicial system. The outcome affecting remuneration has been seen as being motivated by greed. As one academic wrote, the judiciary's \"integrity has been tarnished by the perception of self-interest and [[bias]]\". This author also claimed that a resulting 35% raise for federal judges has led to burdensome [[tax]]es.<ref>LeRoy, Sylvia, \"Judicial Independence and the Integrity of the Judiciary\", ''Fraser Forum'', August 2004. Page 3.</ref> Another scholar wrote that the reference \"demonstrates that judges can be audacious, greedy and jealous\". This scholar said judges' [[standard of living]] prior to the reference was already good, and that provincial judges only seemed to want the same pay as federal judges.<ref>Kahana, page 448.</ref>\n\nScholars have offered various specific critiques for the majority opinion. Among these was that it was self-contradictory. The request that government reasons should be rational and legitimate seemed to ask for two separate things, namely reasonableness and correctness. Rationality allows for government reasons to be accepted if they are not overly flawed, even if courts disagree with them. Legitimacy, meanwhile, implies government decisions should be correct, i.e., consistent with commission recommendations.<ref>Kahana, 452.</ref> Professor [[Peter Hogg]] objected to the notion that governments and judges cannot directly negotiate. He wrote that \"It assumes that there is a real possibility that judges would violate their oath of office and decide cases wrongly (for example, by convicting an innocent person or imposing an unduly harsh penalty) in order to obtain some (highly speculative and likely trivial) advantage at the negotiating table.\"<ref>Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 188.</ref>\n\nHogg also felt the Reference made it increasingly unlikely that judges' salaries can be lowered.  In terms of case law, he pointed to ''[[Mackin v. New Brunswick]]'' (2002) as a case that, after the 1997 Reference, \"reinforced and even extended\" the notion that lowering judges' salaries could be unconstitutional.<ref>Hogg, page 187.</ref>\n\nAfter the Reference, all provinces had salary commissions. The Reference also inspired the federal government under [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] to establish a salary commission for federal judges, the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]].<ref>F.L. Morton and Ranier Knopff, ''The Charter Revolution & the Court Party'', (Toronto: Broadview Press, 2000), page 109.</ref> Still, the ''Provincial Judges Reference'' sparked further litigation as some provincial government's decisions not to follow commissions' salary recommendations were challenged in the courts. The Supreme Court addressed the matter again in 2005 in ''[[Provincial Court Judges' Assn. of New Brunswick v. New Brunswick (Minister of Justice)]]'' and urged courts to be deferential when governments give sufficient reasons for rejecting salary commissions' recommendations.\n\nSome scholars also expressed concern that the reference set a precedent for enforcing unwritten rules. This could lead to even wider grounds for [[judicial review]].<ref>LeRoy, 4.</ref> The study of unwritten rules is also said to have surfaced in the Supreme Court decisions ''[[New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)]]'' (1993) and ''[[Reference re Secession of Quebec]]'' (1998), and one scholar called it a \"very old and venerable\" feature of [[common law]].<ref>Walters, Mark D. \"The Common Law Constitution in Canada:  Return of ''Lex Non Scripta'' as Fundamental Law.\"  The University of Toronto Law Journal, Vol. 51, No. 2. (Spring 2001), page 91.</ref> Conversely, one critic, who claimed the 1997 Reference represented the first time that the unwritten constitution was used to invalidate a statute in Canada,<ref>Leclair, Jean.  \"Canada's Unfathomable Unwritten Constitutional Principles\", 27 Queen's L.J. 2002. page 391.</ref> said that courts had consequently grown \"bolder in their law-creating enterprise\"<ref>Leclair, 392.</ref> and that \"If law requires certainty, unwritten principles are bound to create problems.\"<ref>Leclair, 400.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Lamer Court)]]\n* ''[[Mackeigan v.

Shark and Rectangular Businessman load up a big gun and drive to the gas station that Fitz and Skillet previously set on fire.  Rectangular Businessman mentions to Shark that the townspeople have lost their \"program\" and are going \"out of their minds.\"  Shark shoots one of them.  Fitz, Skillet and Liquor use [[intravenous injection]]s of meat to get to sleep, and Liquor is haunted by a strange dream, in which he's standing in a graveyard. Man/Woman is admiring a flower on a strange empty plain when Shark's face appears in the moon and speaks to her, then a snake slithers toward her and breathes fire into the air.  Golden Joe shows Peanut Cop an unusual photo of the two Eyes, in which one of them appears to have grown a strange purple limb in place of a leg.  Peanut Cop tells him that \"the code is replicating itself in a bad way\", and that \"it's almost over.\"  Liquor awakes, and Producer Man takes the elevator up to the 750th floor of the tower where Fitz, Skillet, Liquor, the Green-Sweatered Woman, and Shark's burning bug await him as Liquor commands everyone on the 750th floor to \"all weapons cock.\"\n\n'''Note''': At the end of the credits, it reads T minus 35 days, stating the number of days until the last televised episode.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Corndog Chronicles\n|WrittenBy=N/A\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|11|20}}\n|ProdCode=209\n|EpisodeNumber=16\n|EpisodeNumber2=9\n|LineColor=71eb60\n|ShortSummary=Fitz has dreams about talking to Shark regarding other dreams in his office.  He describes the dreams to Shark as being \"about the end, with fragments of the beginning.\" Shark tells Fitz that they're \"running out of time\" and offers him a bottle of \"Asprind\" pills from Asprindland.  Fitz wakes up, but Liquor promptly knocks him unconscious again.  Fitz then dreams about talking to Roostre at his corndog farm.  The two of them discuss Q109, \"xenomorphinetation\", a report chart, robots they built, and synthetic [[polymer|carbopolymers]] that \"got them through.\" Fitz awakens and climbs the giant clothes closet to find a gold locket which resembles the Animal Chain that Pronto stole.  Meanwhile, Pronto goes to a graveyard, where he gives the Animal Chain to an eight-armed beast named Amalockh. Amalockh grows enormous and begins destroying the city. Liquor tells Fitz the beast's name and that he's there to kill them all.  Fitz resolves to \"kill him back.\"\n\n'''Note''': After the credits, a message appears that says \"dne reven lliw esuom\" or \"mouse will never end.\" Fitz appears at the top, saying \"Good thing I brought all this beer.\"\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Eighteen\n|WrittenBy=Matt Maiellaro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|11|27}}\n|ProdCode=210\n|EpisodeNumber=17\n|EpisodeNumber2=10\n|LineColor=71eb60\n|ShortSummary=After traveling up the elevator to the 750th floor of the tower, Producer Man reaches Fitz, Skillet, and Liquor.  Liquor x-rays his head to discover that the Hand is inside, translates the beeping sounds he is making, and claims that the Hand \"wants to get back to his arm and kill the person that separated him.\" Liquor tells Fitz that the key he found is \"the key to imagination\" which they'll need the next day.  Meanwhile, Shark kidnaps Golden Joe and the New Guy, stitches Golden Joe's mouth shut and brings them to his video monitoring room, where the Eye is shackled to a pipe.  Rectangular Businessman delivers \"Shark's Great Movie\" to Fitz, in which Shark tells him, \"You're just information.  That's what we keep inside our heads.\"  Fitz places a bone on Liquor's head, giving an easy target for the Cyber-Green-Sweatered-Woman if he doesn't comply, and makes him lead the way through the burning city.  Shark explodes much of the city, including Fitz's jet car, the liquor store, Rhoda's bar, the Eye's island, and New Guy's home, after which he devours the New Guy.  In the graveyard, Amalockh eats Pronto and begins performing the \"[[breakdance]] of death.\"  Shark watches this on his video monitor, and furiously demands that Rectangular Businessman bring him every \"hovervac\" and \"tie-bot.\"  Liquor leads Fitz to the sewer system that Roostre previously entered, while hundreds of hovervacs and tie-bots awaken elsewhere.  The Shadowy Figure drives his shadowy van up to Peanut Cop who is standing on a street, setting things on fire.  Peanut Cop asks for help, and the Shadowy Figure shoots him with an extra-strength dart.\n\n'''Note''': During the credits, an anagram appears that reads \"noso/ledlik/tegs/khsar.\"  When unscrambled, it reads \"Soon/Killed/Gets/Shark,\" or \"Shark gets killed soon.\"\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Pre-Reckoning\n|WrittenBy=N/A\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|12|4}}\n|ProdCode=211\n|EpisodeNumber=18\n|EpisodeNumber2=11\n|LineColor=71eb60\n|ShortSummary=Fitz, Skillet, Liquor, Cyber-Green-Sweatered-Woman and Producer Man descend the sewer system's ladder to reach Roostre, as Fitz worries about his friends in the burning city above.  Liquor explains to him that they've probably all been eaten by now, stating that \"it\" reads \"...and the shark shall eat every creature that is friends of the green one.\"  As Liquor, Roostre, and Fitz are talking, Liquor states that the language is \"giving out\" and the three of them begin speaking in jumbled, nonsensical sentences.  Peanut Cop flies out of the Shadowy Figure's van onto the street when it comes to a stop, and he too begins speaking in jumbled phrases.  Shark soon reveals that gas is being pumped into the city which causes an inability to communicate.  The Eye and Shark discuss the fact that time in the city is frozen at 2:22, and that the Eye was waiting for his dad to pick him up at school when it froze.  The Clock tells Shark that it has run out of the gas.  The hovervacs and tie-bots wreak havoc on the city, killing people and destroying vehicles, buildings, dolls and other property.  Peanut Cop enters the Tempus Putkhe Clock Shop while Amalockh spits out Pronto's burning remains and plucks a flower from the ground in the graveyard.  Shark watches Amalockh on his video monitor, and states that \"if that flower reaches the right person we're all dead, and that will be a great disappointment to me and all that me has become.\" Fitz, Skillet, and Cyber-Green-Sweatered Woman fight off the hovervacs and tie-bots until they reach the safety of the Clock Shop's back room.  Inside, Peanut Cop hands Fitz a mask, which allows them to breathe \"anti-anti-language gas\" which Peanut Cop claims he made from propane.  As the tie-bots attempt to break into the room, Peanut Cop throws a functional clock out the door, causing several tie-bots to explode.  A hovervac quickly smashes the clock, and the tie-bots proceed to break down the door.  However, Fitz, Skillet, Cyber-Green-Sweatered-Woman, and Peanut Cop have escaped through an air vent in the ceiling by the time they enter.  Meanwhile, in the sewer system, Liquor karate chops off Roostre's hook and replaces it with The Hand so that he can activate Corn-Droid.  Corn-Droid comes to life and unveils a plethora of guns which extend from a hole in its stomach.\n\n'''Note''': This episode originally aired on [[Adult Swim Video]] with an unfinished mono audio mix, including missing sound effects and no reverb on Golden Joe's voice.\n\n'''Note''': A secret message is at the end of the credits that reads:\n{{blockquote|14 32 21 37 28 54\n30 19 45 29 20 45<br />\n31 54 18 21 19 16<br />\n54 28 35 19 28 32<br />\n54 45 21 14 39+49}}\nThe code is derived from a [[QWERTY]] keyboard, the letter Q being defined as 13 and all the other keys, including non-characters, numbered sequentially from there.

Peanut Cop throws a grenade and blasts his fireman's helmet off. Fitz, Skillet, and Cyber-Green-Sweatered-Woman burst out the end of the ventilation shaft, which opens into Shark's observation room. Together, they de-shackle the Eye, destroy the evil Eye, shoot Shark into bloody pieces, and set Golden Joe free. After hearing some faint music emanating from Shark's remains, Fitz digs inside of them and pulls out the New Guy, who has been partially digested. Fitz pulls a lever on Shark's video monitoring console, which opens a room containing a metal-plated, shark-shaped aircraft. The Eye says that he's afraid of flying, so he decides to walk to the river and carry the New Guy on top of him.\n\nSomewhere outside the burning city, Rectangular Businessman makes his bank/home appear by simply speaking the word \"appear.\" Inside, he converses with the Shadowy Figure, telling it that \"the clock shop was sealed off when this began,\" \"Shark was just a pawn,\" \"the 'aspirind' farms are near harvest,\" \"Mouse has done everything exactly as predicted,\" and \"Amalockh brings the darkness\", among other things. The Shadowy Figure begins glowing, possibly in an attempt to reveal its \"true form\", but Rectangular Businessman transforms the Shadowy Figure into dark water and traps him in a jar. Rectangular Businessman then puts his home into \"ship mode\" and flies away.\n\nMeanwhile, Corn-Droid flies throughout the city, destroying hovervacs with ease. In the sewer system, Liquor discovers Roostre's eyeless, unconscious body, and Muff, a floating orb that glows blue. Muff inquires where Fitz is, and tells Liquor that the aspirind fields must be destroyed. Muff says they'll meet at the river, but they'll need Fitz. Liquor decides to follow the Corn-Droid. As Fitz steers the shark-shaped aircraft, Peanut Cop reveals that the hovervacs harvest aspirind, that it's \"what they're protecting,\" and that fields of it are everywhere. Below, several tie-bots blow open a street, uncovering massive amounts of aspirind, which the hovervacs quickly suck into their arm-like appendages. In the shark-shaped aircraft, Skillet mans the gun turret and fights off several tie-bots before the aircraft is shot down by Rectangular Businessman, still flying his airship. Liquor watches as the shark-shaped aircraft crashes into a building before screeching to a halt on a city street. After exiting the burning wreckage, Fitz clutches Skillet's helmet and goggles, as he, Peanut Cop, and Golden Joe lament the loss of their friend, who is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Rectangular Businessman's ship is destroyed by the now gigantic Amalockh, sending the jar of water in which the Shadowy Figure is trapped flying out into the flames of the city.\n\n'''Note''': When this episode aired on Adult Swim Fix, several sound effects and lines of dialog were absent, including the Cop's dialog before breaking out of the shaft, the Cop and Golden Joes' argument about who gets to drive, the squelching sound of the water Shadowy Figure and the reverb to Joe's voice in his final spoken line of dialog.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Prolegomenon\n|WrittenBy=Matt Maiellaro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|12|18}}\n|ProdCode=213\n|EpisodeNumber=20\n|EpisodeNumber2=13\n|LineColor=71eb60\n|ShortSummary=Fitz drops Skillet's helmet and goggles on the ground and wanders into the burning diner, where he walks up to a red-glowing [[pinball]] machine and starts playing.  The pinball machine's bumpers are covered in cryptic red symbols.  Soon, a pink cloud with orbiting musical notes descends from the sky outside and flashes brightly, causing the wrecked diner to return to pristine condition.  The pink cloud says that her name is Archeus, after which Fitz tells her he can't read the symbols on the pinball machine.  Archeus tells him he'd be able to read them, if he gives up the fight for \"everything.\" Fitz says that she doesn't make sense, and Archeus responds \"No one understands this.\"  She tells him that his wife and child are alive, but they need his help and warns, \"Don't believe what you haven't been shown.\" She tells him that \"the square guy can afford technology to away the mind.\" Archeus insists that Fitz look to her, but Fitz tells her to leave. She says \"Skillet needs you--\"  Then a tiny ball containing Skillet's image rises out of the pinball machine and floats in the air.\n\nHurtling past planets and stars, the 'camera' zooms in on Earth, and into a forest in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Within the forest, on a tiny particle in the cap of mushroom, we are shown a four-story, weapon-guarded building.  Within, a purple man and a pink man, both wearing glasses and business suits, converse over an unconscious Fitz.  Fitz's head is shown to be attached to a giant orange machine, through which he is breathing.  The purple man, who speaks in Shark's voice, asks the pink man, who speaks in Rectangular Businessman's voice, if he's prepared for the possibility that Fitz may awaken.  They mention how they&nbsp;\u2013 as Shark and Rectangular Businessman&nbsp;\u2013 have been killed.  The pink man tells the purple man that \"money solves everything.\"  The purple man says \"that's great, but the rodent is still alive\", referring to a liquid-filled tube in which Skillet floats.  A man who speaks in the voice of the Eye is attached to another giant machine, with each of his eyes individually connected to the machine by tubes.  The pink man tells the nurse (who speaks in the voice of Green-Sweatered-Woman) to give the mouse 1200 CC's of \"steribolium.\"  The nurse says that will kill him, but the pink man insists on her carrying out his orders.  The pink man notes to the purple man that \"she's there,\" referring to Archeus.  The purple man says that's impossible because \"we blew up the whole ship with my cool bombs.\"  The pink man responds, \"you can destroy the flesh, but you cannot destroy the faith.\"  The purple man rants that he won't be taken down by religion, while the pink man says his god is his money. \"I will not be responsible for an entire nation,\" the purple man states.  \"I can't, legally.\" The pink man says that the power of Archeus is drawing Fitz out.  In another room, the nurse draws a gun and talks to a blue man, who speaks in the voice of Peanut Cop, telling him \"Archeus lives in the stream.\"  After this, the two of them shoot and kill the purple man.  The pink man stops a bullet with his [[telekinetic]] powers, but the blue man appears behind him and shoots him in the back of the head.  The nurse then turns to the blue man saying, \"contact the new angel and tell her to come for us.  Tell her it's time.\"\n\nAfter this, we see the Clock on the wall of the diner, as its minute hand moves to 2:23.  Peanut Cop and Golden Joe are standing over Fitz, who has just woken up, asking him to go get a sandwich.  After realizing that the time has changed, Fitz is surprised by Skillet, who jumps through the diner window and lands on top of him.  Everyone walks outside, and Archeus departs, saying, \"Believe in it, Fitz. We believe in you.\"  Fitz tells Archeus, \"I will.\" Golden Joe is confused by what Fitz said, and he and Peanut Cop say that they thought \"this was finished.\"  Fitz says he did too, \"but I guess we're not.\"  Fitz, Skillet, Golden Joe, and Peanut Cop walk down the street of the now-restored town, and above them the sun sets in a real sky.  Elsewhere, after the credits, a glass jar falls out of the sky and breaks on the street. The Shadowy Figure emerges from it in liquid form, and hops away.\n\n'''Note''': Credits weren't shown when the episode was originally aired. Credits were added to the next replay.

Fitz, Skillet and Liquor use [[intravenous injection]]s of meat to get to sleep, and Liquor is haunted by a strange dream, in which he's standing in a graveyard.

The two of them discuss Q109, \"xenomorphinetation\", a report chart, robots they built, and synthetic [[polymer|carbopolymers]] that \"got them through.\" Fitz awakens and climbs the giant clothes closet to find a gold locket which resembles the Animal Chain that Pronto stole.  Meanwhile, Pronto goes to a graveyard, where he gives the Animal Chain to an eight-armed beast named Amalockh. Amalockh grows enormous and begins destroying the city.

Liquor x-rays his head to discover that the Hand is inside, translates the beeping sounds he is making, and claims that the Hand \"wants to get back to his arm and kill the person that separated him.\" Liquor tells Fitz that the key he found is \"the key to imagination\" which they'll need the next day.  Meanwhile, Shark kidnaps Golden Joe and the New Guy, stitches Golden Joe's mouth shut and brings them to his video monitoring room, where the Eye is shackled to a pipe.  Rectangular Businessman delivers \"Shark's Great Movie\" to Fitz, in which Shark tells him, \"You're just information.  That's what we keep inside our heads.\"  Fitz places a bone on Liquor's head, giving an easy target for the Cyber-Green-Sweatered-Woman if he doesn't comply, and makes him lead the way through the burning city.  Shark explodes much of the city, including Fitz's jet car, the liquor store, Rhoda's bar, the Eye's island, and New Guy's home, after which he devours the New Guy.  In the graveyard, Amalockh eats Pronto and begins performing the \"[[breakdance]] of death.\"  Shark watches this on his video monitor, and furiously demands that Rectangular Businessman bring him every \"hovervac\" and \"tie-bot.\"  Liquor leads Fitz to the sewer system that Roostre previously entered, while hundreds of hovervacs and tie-bots awaken elsewhere.  The Shadowy Figure drives his shadowy van up to Peanut Cop who is standing on a street, setting things on fire.  Peanut Cop asks for help, and the Shadowy Figure shoots him with an extra-strength dart.\n\n'''Note''': During the credits, an anagram appears that reads \"noso/ledlik/tegs/khsar.\"  When unscrambled, it reads \"Soon/Killed/Gets/Shark,\" or \"Shark gets killed soon.\"\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Pre-Reckoning\n|WrittenBy=N/A\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|12|4}}\n|ProdCode=211\n|EpisodeNumber=18\n|EpisodeNumber2=11\n|LineColor=71eb60\n|ShortSummary=Fitz, Skillet, Liquor, Cyber-Green-Sweatered-Woman and Producer Man descend the sewer system's ladder to reach Roostre, as Fitz worries about his friends in the burning city above.  Liquor explains to him that they've probably all been eaten by now, stating that \"it\" reads \"...and the shark shall eat every creature that is friends of the green one.\"  As Liquor, Roostre, and Fitz are talking, Liquor states that the language is \"giving out\" and the three of them begin speaking in jumbled, nonsensical sentences.  Peanut Cop flies out of the Shadowy Figure's van onto the street when it comes to a stop, and he too begins speaking in jumbled phrases.  Shark soon reveals that gas is being pumped into the city which causes an inability to communicate.  The Eye and Shark discuss the fact that time in the city is frozen at 2:22, and that the Eye was waiting for his dad to pick him up at school when it froze.  The Clock tells Shark that it has run out of the gas.  The hovervacs and tie-bots wreak havoc on the city, killing people and destroying vehicles, buildings, dolls and other property.  Peanut Cop enters the Tempus Putkhe Clock Shop while Amalockh spits out Pronto's burning remains and plucks a flower from the ground in the graveyard.  Shark watches Amalockh on his video monitor, and states that \"if that flower reaches the right person we're all dead, and that will be a great disappointment to me and all that me has become.\" Fitz, Skillet, and Cyber-Green-Sweatered Woman fight off the hovervacs and tie-bots until they reach the safety of the Clock Shop's back room.  Inside, Peanut Cop hands Fitz a mask, which allows them to breathe \"anti-anti-language gas\" which Peanut Cop claims he made from propane.  As the tie-bots attempt to break into the room, Peanut Cop throws a functional clock out the door, causing several tie-bots to explode.  A hovervac quickly smashes the clock, and the tie-bots proceed to break down the door.  However, Fitz, Skillet, Cyber-Green-Sweatered-Woman, and Peanut Cop have escaped through an air vent in the ceiling by the time they enter.  Meanwhile, in the sewer system, Liquor karate chops off Roostre's hook and replaces it with The Hand so that he can activate Corn-Droid.  Corn-Droid comes to life and unveils a plethora of guns which extend from a hole in its stomach.\n\n'''Note''': This episode originally aired on [[Adult Swim Video]] with an unfinished mono audio mix, including missing sound effects and no reverb on Golden Joe's voice.\n\n'''Note''': A secret message is at the end of the credits that reads:\n{{blockquote|14 32 21 37 28 54\n30 19 45 29 20 45<br />\n31 54 18 21 19 16<br />\n54 28 35 19 28 32<br />\n54 45 21 14 39+49}}\nThe code is derived from a [[QWERTY]] keyboard, the letter Q being defined as 13 and all the other keys, including non-characters, numbered sequentially from there.

Peanut Cop throws a grenade and blasts his fireman's helmet off. Fitz, Skillet, and Cyber-Green-Sweatered-Woman burst out the end of the ventilation shaft, which opens into Shark's observation room. Together, they de-shackle the Eye, destroy the evil Eye, shoot Shark into bloody pieces, and set Golden Joe free. After hearing some faint music emanating from Shark's remains, Fitz digs inside of them and pulls out the New Guy, who has been partially digested. Fitz pulls a lever on Shark's video monitoring console, which opens a room containing a metal-plated, shark-shaped aircraft. The Eye says that he's afraid of flying, so he decides to walk to the river and carry the New Guy on top of him.\n\nSomewhere outside the burning city, Rectangular Businessman makes his bank/home appear by simply speaking the word \"appear.\" Inside, he converses with the Shadowy Figure, telling it that \"the clock shop was sealed off when this began,\" \"Shark was just a pawn,\" \"the 'aspirind' farms are near harvest,\" \"Mouse has done everything exactly as predicted,\" and \"Amalockh brings the darkness\", among other things. The Shadowy Figure begins glowing, possibly in an attempt to reveal its \"true form\", but Rectangular Businessman transforms the Shadowy Figure into dark water and traps him in a jar. Rectangular Businessman then puts his home into \"ship mode\" and flies away.\n\nMeanwhile, Corn-Droid flies throughout the city, destroying hovervacs with ease. In the sewer system, Liquor discovers Roostre's eyeless, unconscious body, and Muff, a floating orb that glows blue. Muff inquires where Fitz is, and tells Liquor that the aspirind fields must be destroyed. Muff says they'll meet at the river, but they'll need Fitz. Liquor decides to follow the Corn-Droid. As Fitz steers the shark-shaped aircraft, Peanut Cop reveals that the hovervacs harvest aspirind, that it's \"what they're protecting,\" and that fields of it are everywhere. Below, several tie-bots blow open a street, uncovering massive amounts of aspirind, which the hovervacs quickly suck into their arm-like appendages. In the shark-shaped aircraft, Skillet mans the gun turret and fights off several tie-bots before the aircraft is shot down by Rectangular Businessman, still flying his airship. Liquor watches as the shark-shaped aircraft crashes into a building before screeching to a halt on a city street. After exiting the burning wreckage, Fitz clutches Skillet's helmet and goggles, as he, Peanut Cop, and Golden Joe lament the loss of their friend, who is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Rectangular Businessman's ship is destroyed by the now gigantic Amalockh, sending the jar of water in which the Shadowy Figure is trapped flying out into the flames of the city.\n\n'''Note''': When this episode aired on Adult Swim Fix, several sound effects and lines of dialog were absent, including the Cop's dialog before breaking out of the shaft, the Cop and Golden Joes' argument about who gets to drive, the squelching sound of the water Shadowy Figure and the reverb to Joe's voice in his final spoken line of dialog.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Prolegomenon\n|WrittenBy=Matt Maiellaro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|12|18}}\n|ProdCode=213\n|EpisodeNumber=20\n|EpisodeNumber2=13\n|LineColor=71eb60\n|ShortSummary=Fitz drops Skillet's helmet and goggles on the ground and wanders into the burning diner, where he walks up to a red-glowing [[pinball]] machine and starts playing.  The pinball machine's bumpers are covered in cryptic red symbols.  Soon, a pink cloud with orbiting musical notes descends from the sky outside and flashes brightly, causing the wrecked diner to return to pristine condition.  The pink cloud says that her name is Archeus, after which Fitz tells her he can't read the symbols on the pinball machine.  Archeus tells him he'd be able to read them, if he gives up the fight for \"everything.\" Fitz says that she doesn't make sense, and Archeus responds \"No one understands this.\"  She tells him that his wife and child are alive, but they need his help and warns, \"Don't believe what you haven't been shown.\" She tells him that \"the square guy can afford technology to away the mind.\" Archeus insists that Fitz look to her, but Fitz tells her to leave. She says \"Skillet needs you--\"  Then a tiny ball containing Skillet's image rises out of the pinball machine and floats in the air.\n\nHurtling past planets and stars, the 'camera' zooms in on Earth, and into a forest in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Within the forest, on a tiny particle in the cap of mushroom, we are shown a four-story, weapon-guarded building.  Within, a purple man and a pink man, both wearing glasses and business suits, converse over an unconscious Fitz.  Fitz's head is shown to be attached to a giant orange machine, through which he is breathing.  The purple man, who speaks in Shark's voice, asks the pink man, who speaks in Rectangular Businessman's voice, if he's prepared for the possibility that Fitz may awaken.  They mention how they&nbsp;\u2013 as Shark and Rectangular Businessman&nbsp;\u2013 have been killed.  The pink man tells the purple man that \"money solves everything.\"  The purple man says \"that's great, but the rodent is still alive\", referring to a liquid-filled tube in which Skillet floats.  A man who speaks in the voice of the Eye is attached to another giant machine, with each of his eyes individually connected to the machine by tubes.  The pink man tells the nurse (who speaks in the voice of Green-Sweatered-Woman) to give the mouse 1200 CC's of \"steribolium.\"  The nurse says that will kill him, but the pink man insists on her carrying out his orders.  The pink man notes to the purple man that \"she's there,\" referring to Archeus.  The purple man says that's impossible because \"we blew up the whole ship with my cool bombs.\"  The pink man responds, \"you can destroy the flesh, but you cannot destroy the faith.\"  The purple man rants that he won't be taken down by religion, while the pink man says his god is his money. \"I will not be responsible for an entire nation,\" the purple man states.  \"I can't, legally.\" The pink man says that the power of Archeus is drawing Fitz out.  In another room, the nurse draws a gun and talks to a blue man, who speaks in the voice of Peanut Cop, telling him \"Archeus lives in the stream.\"  After this, the two of them shoot and kill the purple man.  The pink man stops a bullet with his [[telekinetic]] powers, but the blue man appears behind him and shoots him in the back of the head.  The nurse then turns to the blue man saying, \"contact the new angel and tell her to come for us.  Tell her it's time.\"\n\nAfter this, we see the Clock on the wall of the diner, as its minute hand moves to 2:23.  Peanut Cop and Golden Joe are standing over Fitz, who has just woken up, asking him to go get a sandwich.  After realizing that the time has changed, Fitz is surprised by Skillet, who jumps through the diner window and lands on top of him.  Everyone walks outside, and Archeus departs, saying, \"Believe in it, Fitz. We believe in you.\"  Fitz tells Archeus, \"I will.\" Golden Joe is confused by what Fitz said, and he and Peanut Cop say that they thought \"this was finished.\"  Fitz says he did too, \"but I guess we're not.\"  Fitz, Skillet, Golden Joe, and Peanut Cop walk down the street of the now-restored town, and above them the sun sets in a real sky.  Elsewhere, after the credits, a glass jar falls out of the sky and breaks on the street. The Shadowy Figure emerges from it in liquid form, and hops away.\n\n'''Note''': Credits weren't shown when the episode was originally aired. Credits were added to the next replay.
