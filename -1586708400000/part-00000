A member of the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]], Lugh is portrayed as a warrior, a king, a master craftsman and a savior.<ref name=olmsted>Olmsted, Garrett. ''The Gods of the Celts and the Indo-Europeans''. University of Innsbruck, 1994. p.117</ref> He is associated with skill and mastery in multiple disciplines, including the arts.<ref name=monaghan>Monaghan, Patricia. ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''. Infobase Publishing, 2004. pp.296-297</ref> He is also associated with oaths, truth and the law,<ref name=olmsted/> and therefore with rightful kingship.<ref name=koch1200>Koch, John T. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia''. ABC-CLIO, 2006. p.1200</ref> Lugh is linked with the harvest festival of [[Lughnasadh]], which bears his name. His most common epithets are ''L\u00e1mfada'' ({{IPA-ga|\u02c8la\u02d0wad\u032a\u02e0\u0259|}}, \"of the long arm,\" possibly for his skill with a [[spear]] or his ability as a ruler) and ''Samild\u00e1nach'' (\"equally skilled in many arts\").\n\nIn mythology, Lugh is the son of [[Cian]] and [[Ethniu]] (or Ethliu). He is the maternal grandson of the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]] tyrant [[Balor]], whom Lugh kills in the ''[[Cath Maige Tuired|Battle of Mag Tuired]]''. His foster-father is the sea god [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Manann\u00e1n]]. Lugh's son is the hero [[C\u00fa Chulainn]], who is believed to be an incarnation of Lugh. \n\nLugh has several magical possessions. He wields an unstoppable fiery spear, a sling stone, and owns a hound named ''[[Failinis]]''. He is said to have invented ''[[fidchell]]'' (a Gaelic equivalent of [[chess]]), ball games, and horse racing.<ref name=\"ohogain\"/>\n\nHe corresponds to the pan-[[Celt]]ic god [[Lugus]], and his [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] counterpart is [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes]]. He has also been equated with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].\n\n==Name==\n===Etymology===\nThe meaning of Lugh's name is still a matter of debate. Some scholars propose it derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*(h2)lewgh-'' meaning \"to bind by oath\" (compare [[Old Irish]] ''luige'' and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''llw'', both meaning \"oath, vow, act of swearing\" and derived from a suffixed [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] form, ''*lugiyo-'', \"oath\"),<ref>Matasovi\u0107, Ranko, Etymological dictionary of proto-Celtic, Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary Series 9, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2009, p. 247.</ref> suggesting he was originally a god of oaths and sworn contracts.<ref name=\"ohogain\"/> When Balor meets Lugh in the Second Battle of Moytura, he calls Lugh a \"babbler.\"<ref name=cmt-ss134/> In the past, his name was generally believed to come from the Proto-Indo-European root *''leuk-'', \"flashing light\", so from Victorian times he has often been considered a [[sun god]], similar to the Greco-Roman [[Apollo]]. However, the figure of Lugh from Irish literature seems to be a better match with the Celtic [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]] as described by Julius Caesar in his ''[[De Bello Gallico]]''.<ref name=\"ohogain\"/> There are serious phonological issues with deriving the name from Proto-Indo-European ''*leuk-'', notably that Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*-k-}}'' never produced Proto-Celtic ''{{lang|cel-x-proto|-g-}}'';<ref>Peter Schrijver, Studies in British Celtic historical phonology, Rodopi, 1995, pp. 348-348</ref> for this reason, modern specialists in Celtic languages no longer accept this etymology.\n\n===Epithets===\n* ''L\u00e1mfada'' ({{IPA-ga|\u02c8la\u02d0wad\u032a\u02e0\u0259|}} (\"of the long arm\") - possibly for his skill with a [[spear]] or his ability as a ruler<ref name=\"koch1200\" />\n* ''Ild\u00e1nach'' (\"skilled in many arts\")\n* ''Samild\u00e1nach'' (\"equally skilled in all the arts\")<ref name=cmt-ss053-083/>\n* ''Lonnansclech''<ref name=cmt-ss055/>\n* ''Lonnb\u00e9imnech'' (\"fierce striker\")\n* ''Macnia'' (\"youthful warrior/hero\")<ref name=\"koch1200\" />\n* ''Conmac'' (\"hound-son\")<ref>MacNeill, Eoin.

In the brief narrative ''Baile in Sc\u00e1il'' Lugh is described as being very large and very beautiful and also as a spear-wielding horseman.<ref>''Baile in Sc\u00e1il: The Phantom's Frenzy'', {{harvp|Dillon|1946|pp=11\u201314}};{{URL|1=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/phantom.html|2=text}} via Celtic Literature Collective, accessed 5 August 2019</ref>\n\nWhen he appears before the wounded  C\u00fa Chulainn in the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faalnge, he is described as follows:\n<blockquote>\"A man fair and tall, with a great head of curly yellow hair. He has a green mantle wrapped about him and a brooch of white silver in the mantle over his breast. Next to his white skin, he wears a tunic of royal satin with red-gold insertion reaching to his knees. He carries a black shield with a hard boss of white-bronze. In his hand a five-pointed spear and next to it a forked javelin. Wonderful is the play and sport and diversion that he makes (with these weapons).

In ''Cath Maige Tuired'' their union is a dynastic marriage following an alliance between the Tuatha D\u00e9 and the Fomorians.<ref name=cmt-ss008/> In the ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]],'' Cian gives the boy to [[Tailtiu]], queen of the [[Fir Bolg]], in [[fosterage]].<ref>''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'' [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/lebor4.html#55 \u00a759]</ref> In the Dindsenchas, Lugh, the foster-son of Tailtiu, is described as the \"son of the Dumb Champion\".<ref name=rennes-099/> In the poem Baile Suthain Sith Eamhna Lugh is called \"descendant of the poet.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Skene |first1=William Forbes |title=Celtic Scotland: Land and people |date=1890 |location=Edinburgh, Scotland |page=413 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tDsUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR15&lpg=PR15&dq=Baile+Suthain+Sith+Eamhna+translation#v=onepage&q=Baile%20Suthain%20Sith%20Eamhna%20translation&f=false |accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nA [[Folklore|folktale]] told to [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] by Shane O'Dugan of [[Tory Island]] in 1835 recounts the birth of a grandson of Balor who grows up to kill his grandfather. The grandson is unnamed, his father is called Mac Cinnfhaelaidh and the manner of his killing of Balor is different, but it has been taken as a version of the birth of Lugh, and was adapted as such by [[Lady Gregory]]. In this tale, Balor hears a druid's prophecy that he will be killed by his own grandson. To prevent this he imprisons his only daughter in the T\u00f3r M\u00f3r (great tower) of [[Tory Island]]. She is cared for by twelve women, who are to prevent her ever meeting or even learning of the existence of men. On the mainland, Mac Cinnfhaelaidh owns a magic cow who gives such abundant milk that everyone, including Balor, wants to possess her. While the cow is in the care of Mac Cinnfhaelaidh's brother Mac Samthainn, Balor appears in the form of a little red-haired boy and tricks him into giving him the cow. Looking for revenge, Mac Cinnfhaelaidh calls on a ''[[leanan s\u00eddhe]]'' (fairy woman) called [[Bir\u00f3g]], who transports him by magic to the top of Balor's tower, where he seduces Eithne. In time she gives birth to triplets, which Balor gathers up in a sheet and sends to be drowned in a whirlpool. The messenger drowns two of the babies but unwittingly drops one child into the harbour, where he is rescued by Bir\u00f3g. She takes him to his father, who gives him to his brother, [[Goibniu|Gavida]] the smith, in fosterage.<ref>[[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] (ed. & trans.), ''Annala Rioghachta \u00c9ireann: Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters'' Vol. 1, 1856, pp. 18\u201321, footnote ''S''; T.

His father in the folktale is one of a triad of brothers, Mac Cinnfhaelaidh, Gavida, and Mac Samthainn, whereas in the ''Lebor Gab\u00e1la'', his father Cian is mentioned alongside his brothers C\u00fa and Cethen.<ref name=lge-para314/><ref>Cf. {{harvp|O'Curry|1863|pp=170\u2013171}}, n 161, n162</ref>{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|e.g. According to the ''Rennes Dindsenchas'' \u00a714, C\u00fa killed Cethen, and there once was a well-known phrase that \"Thou hast acted for me C\u00fa and Cethen\".<ref name=rennes-ss14&066/>}} Two characters called [[Lugaid (disambiguation)|Lugaid]], a popular [[medieval]] Irish name thought to derive from Lugh, have three fathers: [[Lugaid Riab nDerg]] (Lugaid of the Red Stripes)  was the son of the three ''[[Findemna]]'' or fair triplets,<ref>Vernam Hull (ed. & Trans.), [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/medb.html \"''Aided Meidbe'': The Violent Death of Medb\"], ''Speculum'' v.13 issue 1.

The doorkeeper will not let him in unless he has a skill he can use to serve the king. He offers his services as a wright, a smith, a champion, a swordsman, a harpist, a hero, a poet, historian, a sorcerer, and a craftsman, but each time is rejected as the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann already have someone with that skill. When Lugh asks if they have anyone with all those skills simultaneously, the doorkeeper has to admit defeat, and Lugh joins the court and is appointed [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bardmythologies.com/lugh/|title=Lugh|website=bardmythologies.com  |access-date=2017-08-01}}</ref> He wins a flagstone-throwing contest against [[Ogma]], the champion, and entertains the court with his [[harp]]. The Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann are, at that time, oppressed by the Fomorians, and Lugh is amazed how meekly they accept their oppression. Nuada wonders if this young man could lead them to freedom. Lugh is given command over the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, and he begins making preparations for war.<ref name=cmt-ss053-083/>\n\n===Sons of Tuireann===\n[[Tuireann]] and Cian, Lugh's father, are old enemies, and one day his sons, Brian, [[Iuchar]], and [[Iucharba]] spot Cian in the distance and decide to kill him. They find him hiding in the form of a pig, but Cian tricked the brothers into allowing him to transform back to a man before they killed him, giving Lugh the legal right to claim compensation for a father rather than just a pig. When they try to bury him, the ground spits his body back twice before keeping him down, and eventually confesses that it is a grave to Lugh. Lugh holds a feast and invites the brothers, and during it he asks them what they would demand as compensation for the murder of their father. They reply that death would be the only just demand, and Lugh agrees. He then accuses them of the murder of his father, Cian, and sets them a series of seemingly impossible quests. The brothers go on an adventure and achieve them all except the last one, which will surely kill them. Despite Tuireann's pleas, Lugh demands that they proceed and, when they are all fatally wounded, he denies them the use of one of the items they have retrieved, a magic pigskin which heals all wounds. They die of their wounds and Tuireann dies of grief over their bodies.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/turenn.html \"The Fate of the Children of Tuirenn\"], {{harvp|Cross|Slover|1936|pp=49\u201381}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of Magh Tuireadh===\nUsing the magic artefacts the sons of Tuireann have gathered, Lugh leads the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann in the [[Cath Maige Tuireadh|Second Battle of Mag Tuireadh]] against the [[Fomorians]]. Prior to the battle Lugh asks each man and woman in his army what art he or she will bring to the fray; he then addressed his army in speech, which elevated each warrior's spirit to that of a king or lord.<ref name=cmt-ss120/> Nuada is killed in the battle by Balor. Lugh faces Balor, who opens his terrible, poisonous eye that kills all it looks upon, but Lugh shoots a [[sling (weapon)|sling]]-stone that drives his eye out the back of his head, killing Balor and wreaking havoc on the Fomorian army behind. After the victory Lugh finds [[Bres]], the half-Fomorian former king of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, alone and unprotected on the battlefield, and Bres begs for his life. If he is spared, he promises, he will ensure that the cows of Ireland always give milk. The Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann refuse the offer. He then promises four harvests a year, but the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann say one harvest a year suits them. But Lugh spares his life on the condition that he teach the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann how and when to plough, sow, and reap.<ref name=cmt-ss074-167/>\n\n===Later life and death===\nLugh instituted an event similar to the [[Olympic games]] called the [[Assembly of Talti]] which finished on [[Lughnasadh]] (1 August) in memory of his foster-mother, Tailtiu, at the town that bears her name (now [[Teltown]], [[County Meath]]). He likewise instituted Lughnasadh fairs in the areas of Carman and [[Naas]] in honour of [[Carman]] and N\u00e1s, the eponymous tutelary goddess of these two regions. Horse races and displays of martial arts were important activities at all three fairs. However, Lughnasadh itself is a celebration of Lugh's triumph over the spirits of the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] who had tried to keep the harvest for themselves. It survived long into Christian times and is still celebrated under a variety of names. ''L\u00fanasa'' is now the [[Irish language|Irish]] name for the month of August.\n\nAccording to a poem of the ''[[dindsenchas]]'', Lugh was responsible for the death of Bres. He made 300 wooden cows and filled them with a bitter, poisonous red liquid which was then \"milked\" into pails and offered to Bres to drink. Bres, who was under an obligation not to refuse hospitality, drank it down without flinching, and it killed him.<ref>{{harvp|Gwynn|1913|pp=216\u2013223}}, ''The Metrical Dindshenchas'' Part III.

A member of the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]], Lugh is portrayed as a warrior, a king, a master craftsman and a savior.<ref name=olmsted>Olmsted, Garrett. ''The Gods of the Celts and the Indo-Europeans''. University of Innsbruck, 1994. p.117</ref> He is associated with skill and mastery in multiple disciplines, including the arts.<ref name=monaghan>Monaghan, Patricia. ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''. Infobase Publishing, 2004. pp.296-297</ref> He is also associated with oaths, truth and the law,<ref name=olmsted/> and therefore with rightful kingship.<ref name=koch1200>Koch, John T. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia''. ABC-CLIO, 2006. p.1200</ref> Lugh is linked with the harvest festival of [[Lughnasadh]], which bears his name. His most common epithets are ''L\u00e1mfada'' ({{IPA-ga|\u02c8la\u02d0wad\u032a\u02e0\u0259|}}, \"of the long arm,\" possibly for his skill with a [[spear]] or his ability as a ruler) and ''Samild\u00e1nach'' (\"equally skilled in many arts\").\n\nIn mythology, Lugh is the son of [[Cian]] and [[Ethniu]] (or Ethliu). He is the maternal grandson of the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]] tyrant [[Balor]], whom Lugh kills in the ''[[Cath Maige Tuired|Battle of Mag Tuired]]''. His foster-father is the sea god [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Manann\u00e1n]]. Lugh's son is the hero [[C\u00fa Chulainn]], who is believed to be an incarnation of Lugh. \n\nLugh has several magical possessions. He wields an unstoppable fiery spear, a sling stone, and owns a hound named ''[[Failinis]]''. He is said to have invented ''[[fidchell]]'' (a Gaelic equivalent of [[chess]]), ball games, and horse racing.<ref name=\"ohogain\"/>\n\nHe corresponds to the pan-[[Celt]]ic god [[Lugus]], and his [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] counterpart is [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes]]. He has also been equated with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].\n\n==Name==\n===Etymology===\nThe meaning of Lugh's name is still a matter of debate. Some scholars propose it derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*(h2)lewgh-'' meaning \"to bind by oath\" (compare [[Old Irish]] ''luige'' and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''llw'', both meaning \"oath, vow, act of swearing\" and derived from a suffixed [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] form, ''*lugiyo-'', \"oath\"),<ref>Matasovi\u0107, Ranko, Etymological dictionary of proto-Celtic, Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary Series 9, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2009, p. 247.</ref> suggesting he was originally a god of oaths and sworn contracts.<ref name=\"ohogain\"/> When Balor meets Lugh in the Second Battle of Moytura, he calls Lugh a \"babbler.\"<ref name=cmt-ss134/> In the past, his name was generally believed to come from the Proto-Indo-European root *''leuk-'', \"flashing light\", so from Victorian times he has often been considered a [[sun god]], similar to the Greco-Roman [[Apollo]]. However, the figure of Lugh from Irish literature seems to be a better match with the Celtic [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]] as described by Julius Caesar in his ''[[De Bello Gallico]]''.<ref name=\"ohogain\"/> There are serious phonological issues with deriving the name from Proto-Indo-European ''*leuk-'', notably that Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*-k-}}'' never produced Proto-Celtic ''{{lang|cel-x-proto|-g-}}'';<ref>Peter Schrijver, Studies in British Celtic historical phonology, Rodopi, 1995, pp. 348-348</ref> for this reason, modern specialists in Celtic languages no longer accept this etymology.\n\n===Epithets===\n* ''L\u00e1mfada'' ({{IPA-ga|\u02c8la\u02d0wad\u032a\u02e0\u0259|}} (\"of the long arm\") - possibly for his skill with a [[spear]] or his ability as a ruler<ref name=\"koch1200\" />\n* ''Ild\u00e1nach'' (\"skilled in many arts\")\n* ''Samild\u00e1nach'' (\"equally skilled in all the arts\")<ref name=cmt-ss053-083/>\n* ''Lonnansclech''<ref name=cmt-ss055/>\n* ''Lonnb\u00e9imnech'' (\"fierce striker\")\n* ''Macnia'' (\"youthful warrior/hero\")<ref name=\"koch1200\" />\n* ''Conmac'' (\"hound-son\")<ref>MacNeill, Eoin.

In the brief narrative ''Baile in Sc\u00e1il'' Lugh is described as being very large and very beautiful and also as a spear-wielding horseman.<ref>''Baile in Sc\u00e1il: The Phantom's Frenzy'', {{harvp|Dillon|1946|pp=11\u201314}};{{URL|1=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/phantom.html|2=text}} via Celtic Literature Collective, accessed 5 August 2019</ref>\n\nWhen he appears before the wounded  C\u00fa Chulainn in the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faalnge, he is described as follows:\n<blockquote>\"A man fair and tall, with a great head of curly yellow hair. He has a green mantle wrapped about him and a brooch of white silver in the mantle over his breast. Next to his white skin, he wears a tunic of royal satin with red-gold insertion reaching to his knees. He carries a black shield with a hard boss of white-bronze. In his hand a five-pointed spear and next to it a forked javelin. Wonderful is the play and sport and diversion that he makes (with these weapons).

The grandson is unnamed, his father is called Mac Cinnfhaelaidh and the manner of his killing of Balor is different, but it has been taken as a version of the birth of Lugh, and was adapted as such by [[Lady Gregory]]. In this tale, Balor hears a druid's prophecy that he will be killed by his own grandson. To prevent this he imprisons his only daughter in the T\u00f3r M\u00f3r (great tower) of [[Tory Island]]. She is cared for by twelve women, who are to prevent her ever meeting or even learning of the existence of men. On the mainland, Mac Cinnfhaelaidh owns a magic cow who gives such abundant milk that everyone, including Balor, wants to possess her. While the cow is in the care of Mac Cinnfhaelaidh's brother Mac Samthainn, Balor appears in the form of a little red-haired boy and tricks him into giving him the cow. Looking for revenge, Mac Cinnfhaelaidh calls on a ''[[leanan s\u00eddhe]]'' (fairy woman) called [[Bir\u00f3g]], who transports him by magic to the top of Balor's tower, where he seduces Eithne. In time she gives birth to triplets, which Balor gathers up in a sheet and sends to be drowned in a whirlpool. The messenger drowns two of the babies but unwittingly drops one child into the harbour, where he is rescued by Bir\u00f3g. She takes him to his father, who gives him to his brother, [[Goibniu|Gavida]] the smith, in fosterage.<ref>[[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] (ed. & trans.), ''Annala Rioghachta \u00c9ireann: Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters'' Vol. 1, 1856, pp. 18\u201321, footnote ''S''; T.

His father in the folktale is one of a triad of brothers, Mac Cinnfhaelaidh, Gavida, and Mac Samthainn, whereas in the in the ''Lebor Gab\u00e1la'', his father Cian is mentioned alongside his brothers C\u00fa and Cethen.<ref name=lge-para314/><ref>Cf. {{harvp|O'Curry|1863|pp=170\u2013171}}, n 161, n162</ref>{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|e.g. According to the ''Rennes Dindsenchas'' \u00a714, C\u00fa killed Cethen, and there once was a well-known phrase that \"Thou hast acted for me C\u00fa and Cethen\".<ref name=rennes-ss14&066/>}} Two characters called [[Lugaid (disambiguation)|Lugaid]], a popular [[medieval]] Irish name thought to derive from Lugh, have three fathers: [[Lugaid Riab nDerg]] (Lugaid of the Red Stripes)  was the son of the three ''[[Findemna]]'' or fair triplets,<ref>Vernam Hull (ed. & Trans.), [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/medb.html \"''Aided Meidbe'': The Violent Death of Medb\"], ''Speculum'' v.13 issue 1.

The doorkeeper will not let him in unless he has a skill he can use to serve the king. He offers his services as a wright, a smith, a champion, a swordsman, a harpist, a hero, a poet, historian, a sorcerer, and a craftsman, but each time is rejected as the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann already have someone with that skill. When Lugh asks if they have anyone with all those skills simultaneously, the doorkeeper has to admit defeat, and Lugh joins the court and is appointed [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bardmythologies.com/lugh/|title=Lugh|website=bardmythologies.com  |access-date=2017-08-01}}</ref> He wins a flagstone-throwing contest against [[Ogma]], the champion, and entertains the court with his [[harp]]. The Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann are, at that time, oppressed by the Fomorians, and Lugh is amazed how meekly they accept their oppression. Nuada wonders if this young man could lead them to freedom. Lugh is given command over the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, and he begins making preparations for war.<ref name=cmt-ss053-083/>\n\n===Sons of Tuireann===\n[[Tuireann]] and Cian, Lugh's father, are old enemies, and one day his sons, Brian, [[Iuchar]], and [[Iucharba]] spot Cian in the distance and decide to kill him. They find him hiding in the form of a pig, but Cian tricked the brothers into allowing him to transform back to a man before they killed him, giving Lugh the legal right to claim compensation for a father rather than just a pig. When they try to bury him, the ground spits his body back twice before keeping him down, and eventually confesses that it is a grave to Lugh. Lugh holds a feast and invites the brothers, and during it he asks them what they would demand as compensation for the murder of their father. They reply that death would be the only just demand, and Lugh agrees. He then accuses them of the murder of his father, Cian, and sets them a series of seemingly impossible quests. The brothers go on an adventure and achieve them all except the last one, which will surely kill them. Despite Tuireann's pleas, Lugh demands that they proceed and, when they are all fatally wounded, he denies them the use of one of the items they have retrieved, a magic pigskin which heals all wounds. They die of their wounds and Tuireann dies of grief over their bodies.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/turenn.html \"The Fate of the Children of Tuirenn\"], {{harvp|Cross|Slover|1936|pp=49\u201381}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of Magh Tuireadh===\nUsing the magic artefacts the sons of Tuireann have gathered, Lugh leads the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann in the [[Cath Maige Tuireadh|Second Battle of Mag Tuireadh]] against the [[Fomorians]]. Prior to the battle Lugh asks each man and woman in his army what art he or she will bring to the fray; he then addressed his army in speech, which elevated each warrior's spirit to that of a king or lord.<ref name=cmt-ss120/> Nuada is killed in the battle by Balor. Lugh faces Balor, who opens his terrible, poisonous eye that kills all it looks upon, but Lugh shoots a [[sling (weapon)|sling]]-stone that drives his eye out the back of his head, killing Balor and wreaking havoc on the Fomorian army behind. After the victory Lugh finds [[Bres]], the half-Fomorian former king of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, alone and unprotected on the battlefield, and Bres begs for his life. If he is spared, he promises, he will ensure that the cows of Ireland always give milk. The Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann refuse the offer. He then promises four harvests a year, but the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann say one harvest a year suits them. But Lugh spares his life on the condition that he teach the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann how and when to plough, sow, and reap.<ref name=cmt-ss074-167/>\n\n===Later life and death===\nLugh instituted an event similar to the [[Olympic games]] called the [[Assembly of Talti]] which finished on [[Lughnasadh]] (1 August) in memory of his foster-mother, Tailtiu, at the town that bears her name (now [[Teltown]], [[County Meath]]). He likewise instituted Lughnasadh fairs in the areas of Carman and [[Naas]] in honour of [[Carman]] and N\u00e1s, the eponymous tutelary goddess of these two regions. Horse races and displays of martial arts were important activities at all three fairs. However, Lughnasadh itself is a celebration of Lugh's triumph over the spirits of the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] who had tried to keep the harvest for themselves. It survived long into Christian times and is still celebrated under a variety of names. ''L\u00fanasa'' is now the [[Irish language|Irish]] name for the month of August.\n\nAccording to a poem of the ''[[dindsenchas]]'', Lugh was responsible for the death of Bres. He made 300 wooden cows and filled them with a bitter, poisonous red liquid which was then \"milked\" into pails and offered to Bres to drink. Bres, who was under an obligation not to refuse hospitality, drank it down without flinching, and it killed him.<ref>{{harvp|Gwynn|1913|pp=216\u2013223}}, ''The Metrical Dindshenchas'' Part III.

According to the interpretation of this slogan by the founders of the Second Austrian Republic, the ''[[Anschluss]]'' which occurred in 1938 was an act of military aggression by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Austrian statehood had been interrupted and therefore the newly revived Austria of 1945 could not and should not be considered responsible for the [[Nuremberg trials|Nazis' crimes]] in any way. The \"[[victim theory]]\" which was formed by 1949 ({{lang-de|Opferthese, Opferdoktrin}}) insisted that all of the Austrians, including those who strongly supported [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], had been unwilling victims of the Nazi regime and were therefore not responsible for its crimes.\n\nThe \"victim theory\" became a fundamental myth in Austrian society. It made it possible for previously bitter political opponents \u2013 i.e. the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|social democrats]] and the [[Austrian People's Party|conservative Catholics]] \u2013 to unite and bring former Nazis back into social and political life for the first time in [[History of Austria|Austrian history]]. For almost half a century, the Austrian state denied the existence of any continuity between it and the political regime which existed in Austria from 1938\u20131945, actively kept up the self-sacrificing myth of Austrian nationhood, and cultivated a conservative spirit of national unity. Postwar [[denazification]] was quickly wound up; veterans of the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Waffen-SS]] took an honorable place in society. The struggle for justice by the actual victims of [[Nazism]] \u2013 first of all [[Jews]] \u2013 was deprecated as an attempt to obtain illicit enrichment at the expense of the entire nation.\n\nIn 1986, the election of a former Wehrmacht intelligence officer, [[Kurt Waldheim]], as a [[List of Federal Presidents of Austria|federal president]] put Austria on the verge of international isolation. Powerful outside pressure and an internal political discussion forced Austrians to reconsider their attitude to the past. Starting with the political administration of the 1990s and followed by most of the Austrian people by the mid-2000s, the nation admitted its collective responsibility for the crimes committed during the Nazi occupation and officially abandoned the \"victim theory\".\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{Main|Anschluss|German nationalism in Austria|German Confederation|German Question|Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|280px|A map of the German Confederation.]]\nThe idea of grouping all [[Germans]] into a nation-state country had been the subject of debate in the 19th century from the ending of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the ending of the [[German Confederation]]. The [[Habsburgs]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] favored the ''Gro\u00dfdeutsche L\u00f6sung'' (\"Greater German solution\") idea of uniting all German-speaking peoples into one-state. On the other hand, the ''Kleindeutsche L\u00f6sung'' (\"Lesser German solution\") sought only to unify the northern German states and not include Austria; this proposal was largely advocated by the inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Geiss|first=Imanuel|title=The Question of German Unification: 1806-1996|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415150491|page=38}}</ref> The Prussians defeated the Austrians in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866 which ultimately excluded Austria and the Austrian Germans from Germany. [[Otto von Bismarck]] established the [[North German Confederation]] which sought to prevent the Austrian and Bavarian Catholics from forming any sort of force against the predominantly Protestant Prussian Germany. He used the [[Franco-Prussian War]] to convince other German states, including the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] to fight against the [[Second French Empire]]. After Prussia's victory in the war, he swiftly [[Unification of Germany|unified Germany]] into a nation-state in 1871 and proclaimed the [[German Empire]], without Austria.<ref>{{cite book|author=James J.

During its existence, the German-speaking Austrians hoped for the empire to dissolve and advocated an ''Anschluss'' with Germany. Following the dissolution of the empire in 1918, the rump state of [[Republic of German-Austria|German-Austria]], was created. Immediately following the publication of humiliating terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] a drive for unification with Germany appeared, but its practical actions were strictly suppressed by [[Triple Entente|victory states]]. The name \"German-Austria\" and union with Germany was strictly forbidden and gave way to the [[First Austrian Republic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1920/3.html |title=Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Austria; Protocol, Declaration and Special Declaration [1920&#93; ATS 3 |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref> An independent Austrian Republic turned out to be non-viable. \n[[File:Dissolution of Austria-Hungary.png|thumb|350px|The split-up of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918.]]\nAfter a short period of unity (1918\u20131920) people not recognizing themselves as a nation divided up into three armed enemy camps: working class lead by [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|social democrats]]; conservative Catholic powers led by governing [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] and the [[Catholic Church in Austria|Catholic Church]]; and supporters of the unification with Germany.{{sfn|Pelinka|1988|p=71}} In 1933 the head of conservatives [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] dissolved parliament, drove social democrats out of power-holding structures, banned [[Communist Party of Austria|communists]] and Nazis and installed a one-party [[Austrofascism|authoritarian rule]] of a right-wing trend.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=16}} In February 1934 the conflict developed into a [[Austrian Civil War|civil war]] that resulted in the defeat of the left-wing forces.

On December 16 [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] reported to [[Anthony Eden]] his plan for German break up: Austria would become an independent state again.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|pp=25\u201326}} The British, having no plans for such a distant future, had nothing against this proposal. During 1942\u20131943 the attitude of the Allies to the Austrian question changed: the leaders of the USSR had not suggested any new scheme, while the British took into serious consideration the future Austria.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=26}} On September 26, 1942 Eden declared Churchill's plan of creation of a \"Danube confederation\" composed of former Austria, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia \u2013 a vast buffer state that would have separated Western Europe from the USSR.{{sfn|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1973|p=138}}{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} In the Spring of 1943, a 34 year old civil servant in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign office]] [[Geoffrey Harrison]] deveoped a plan for the post-war organisation of Austria, which subsequently became the official British policy in regard to the Austrian question.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=27, 33}} Harrison's viewpoint was that recreation of an independent but weak Austria within the borders of the First Republic was only possible with the readiness of the Western allies to support the new state for many years long.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=31}} Harrison did not believe in the ability of the Austrians to self-organize nor in the probability them rising in armed resistance against the regime.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=138\u2013139}} The best solution according to British point of view would have been a strong confederation of Danube states with Austria included de jure as an equal member, but de facto as a cultural and political leader.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|pp=31\u201332}} It was not possible to create such a union in the immediate post war Europe; an independent Austria would have to be created first, and it should have been provided with political guarantees and financial support. Only afterwards a political union could have been developed step-by-step.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=33}}\n\nSoviet historiography of 1970s called the British project an attempt to \"push through the idea of a new Anschluss\".{{sfn|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1973|p=138}} As M.

Keyserling, the British were mainly guided by erroneous utopian plans to foment a mass resistance against Nazi regime in Austrian lands, to disrupt German Reich from the inside and to create a convenient springboard for attack from the South.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}}{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|p=157}} Both the points of view support that in 1943 British as well as American politics mistakenly thought that Germany has been ready to collapse under pressure from the Soviet troops or from people's indignation from the inside of Reich.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=132\u2013133}}{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=27}}\n\n=== Text endorsements ===\n\nAt the end of May 1943 Harrison's plan was approved by the British cabinet,{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=33}} but by June [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] had let the Foreign Office know that any association or confederation of Danube states were not acceptable to the USSR.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} Molotov's deputy, [[Solomon Lozovsky]], decried such a union calling it \"the instrument of anti-Soviet politics\".{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} The British did not abandon the plan, so on August 14, 1943 Eden sent the Harison's project of the \"Declaration on Austria\" to Moscow and Washington. The text started by stating that \"Austria was the first free country to fall victim to Nazi aggression\u2026.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=33}} Again, facing resistance of Soviet diplomats the British started to back down. According to Soviet insistence the project lost any mention of association with neighbouring states and [[Atlantic Charter]], the \"Austrian nation\" was replaced with an unambiguous \"Austria\", \"Nazi aggression\" \u2013 with \"Hitlerite aggression\".{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} The British negotiations with the Americans were not any less difficult.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|p=145}}\n\nThe [[Moscow Declarations#Declaration on Austria|Moscow Declaration on Austria]] became the result of this haggling between the Allied ministers.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} It was adopted on September 30th and published on November 1st, 1943. Despite all the edits made, the phrase \"the first victim\" remained practically untouched: \"Austria, the first free country to fall a victim to Hitlerite aggression, shall be liberated from German domination\u2026\". The text was finished with a strict reminder, which was insisted by Stalin, that Austria \"has a responsibility, which she cannot evade, for participation in the war on the side of Hitlerite Germany\" ([[:s:en:Moscow Declarations#Declaration on Austria|full text]]). According to Stalin's addendum the responsibility was not lying on the shoulders of certain people, groups or parties, but the society in whole; there was no way for an Austrian to escape from collective responsibility.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} Stalin, like Churchill, had also considered Austria to be a buffer between Soviet and Anglo-American spheres of influence, and [[Communist International#Dissolution|has not been in a hurry to carry out]] the \"[[export of revolution]]\".{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} His short-term goal was to exploit the surviving Austrian industrial, human and natural resources; probably that's why Stalin insisted on the stricter wording concering responsibility.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} The authors are unlikely to have suspected \"the first victim\" would become an Austrian national theme, which would be carefully cultivated and protected, and determine Austrian foreign policy for many years.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=18}} Moreover, they didn't know that another part of the Declaration \u2013 the Austrian responsibility \u2013 would die on the vine.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=18}}\n\n=== Response of belligerent Austrians ===\n\nDifferent historical schools admit that defeats in 1943 gave rise to doubt amongst the Austrians about the future of the Reich and helped the spread of separatist sentiments.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} But they disagree on the role of this sentiment in history. According to the official post-war Austrian point of view the defeat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] started a fully fledged \"national awakening\".{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} Soviet historians insisted that in 1943 a new stage of [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] began in Austria, and the Moscow Declaration proved to be an \"important factor that influenced the Austrian nation\".{{sfn|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1973|p=135}} Contemporary Western historians believe that there is no reason for drawing firm conclusions about \"awakening\" or \"resistance\".{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} It goes without saying that antihitlerite and separatist sentiments had been spreading both in Vienna and remote places of Austria, but nearly in the same degree as in other lands of the Reich.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|pp=186, 188, 193}} War defeats, Italian withdrawal from war, Anglo-American bombings,    streams of refugees and prisoners facilitated this, but Western historians deny the influence of the Moscow Declaration. Evan Bukey admits that the Declaration inspired the Austrian underground, but neither increased their forces nor helped to spread separatist sentiments.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} R. Keyserlingk wrote that the Declaration brought the Allies more harm than good.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=159\u2013160}} The operation of British propagandists among Austrian soldiers at the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian front]] failed :{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=36}} the Moscow Declaration has not influenced the fighting spirit of German troops and, probably, merely was a great help for Goebbels' [[counterpropaganda]].{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=159\u2013160}}\n\nAustria was far behind the lines of belligerent Germany and the reaction of Austrian civilians on the Moscow Declaration was twofold.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} On one hand, people made a false conclusion that the status of \"the first victim\" will help Austria to avoid allied bombings.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} On the other hand, \"Moscow\" in the title was unmistakably associated not with the western allies, but with uncompromising [[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} People, in whole, were indifferent to the news and did not support any anti-Hitler opposition groups.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=104}} During 1943\u20131944 the number of arrests increased, but 80% of arrested were foreign workers, whose number was 140 thousand in Vienna alone.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=205}} During 1944, as the military and economical landscape got worse, dissatisfaction increased among Austrians too, but not with the Hitler regime, but with the stream of refugees, especially Protestants, \"from the North\".{{sfn|Bukey|2002|pp=197, 198, 206}} Internal conflicts did not undermine the fighting spirit of the nation. Quite the contrary, the success of the Allies and reactivation of air bombings of Austria only consolidated its population around the figure of the Fuehrer.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=209}}{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|p=163}} During the unsuccessful [[20 July plot]] people of Vienna fully supported Hitler.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=213}}\n\n== Declaration of 'Victimhood' ==\n[[File:Heldendenkmal der Roten Armee, Schwarzenbergplatz Wien 3.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[Soviet War Memorial (Vienna)|Heroes' Monument of the Red Army in Vienna]].

Two weeks later, on April 27, the Provisional Government, formed by the Soviet forces under [[Karl Renner]], promulgated the \"Proclamation of the Second Republic of Austria\", which literally reprinted the text of the Moscow Declaration.{{sfn|Steininger|2008|pp=43\u201344}} Renner, who had previously been an active supporter of the Anschluss,{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=44}} still considered it a historical necessity, and  expressed his regret over the forced separation of Austria and Germany under the pressure of the Allies in his address to the nation. The majority of Austrians agreed with him.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=227}} But the proclamation of April 27, which was addressed not so much to the nationals as to the victory states, declared the opposite: events of 1938 were not the result of agreement between equal parties or expression of the popular will, but the result of \"an uncovered external pressure, a terrorist plot by own National Socialist [Nazi] minority, deception and blackmail during talks, and then \u2013 an open military occupation \u2026 The Adolf Hitler's Third Reich deprived people of Austria of their power and freedom to express their will, led them to a senseless and pointless massacre, which no one Austrian has not wanted to take part in.\"<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.cvce.eu/en/collections/unit-content/-/unit/02bb76df-d066-4c08-a58a-d4686a3e68ff/19940f1c-07c9-41b6-a443-0f0b74c15042/Resources#a49eaade-2468-46fd-80ad-000d471beb0b_de&overlay | title=Proclamation of the Second Republic of Austria (Vienna, 27 April 1945) | publisher=Le Gouvernement du Grand-Duche de Luxembourg | quote=}}</ref>{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}}\n\nThe proclamation of April 27 gingerly repudiated the claim of the Moscow declaration about Austria's own contribution to its liberation: since, as the fathers of the Second Republic asserted, during 1938\u20131945s the Austrian statehood had been temporarily interrupted, the revived Austria should not have been responsible for crimes of \"invaders\".{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=18}}{{sfn|Uhl|1997|pp=65\u201366}} In May\u2013June 1945 the Provisional Government recorded this proposition in an official \"doctrine of the occupation\" ({{lang-de|Okkupationsdoktrin}}).{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=18}} All the guilt and responsibility for the crimes of occupation regime was laid at the door of Germany \u2013 the only successor of the Hitlerite Reich.{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=18}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=25}} The position of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Austria on the Jewish question became a practical consequence of this doctrine: as there had not been Austrians to persecute Jews, but German occupiers, then \"according to the international law Austrian Jews should submit their claims for reparations not to Austria, but to German Reich\".{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=16}} The Foreign Minister of Austria [[Karl Gruber]] organized the compilation and publishing of \"{{ill|Red-White-Red Book|de|Rot-Wei\u00df-Rot-Buch}}\" in order to persuade the victorious Allied Powers.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=229}}{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=19}} The intent of the Austrian politicians, in publishing this collection of real documents and \"historical comments\" that were selectively compiled, was to persuade the victorious Allied Powers of the forced nature of the Anschluss (that was true) and also in a mass rejection of Hitler regime by Austrians (that was not true).{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=229}} The book was planned to have more than one volume. But the second volume, the \"story of Austrian resistance\", was not published: according to the official version not enough archive evidence was found.{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=19}} The authors affirmed, for instance, that in 1938 70% of Austrians had not simply been against Anschluss, but they were said to feel a \"fanatic animosity\" against it.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=229}} This is how the myth was established to later become an ideological foundation of the postwar Austria.{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=13}}{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=19}}\n\nFounders of the Second Republic probably had a moral right to consider themselves to be victims of political repressions.{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=14}} Twelve of the seventeen members of the Cabinet of [[Leopold Figl]], that headed the government in December 1945, were persecuted under Dollfuss, Schuschnigg and Hitler.

Propaganda of the feats of the Austrian resistance proved to the Allies the contribution made to the defeat of Nazism, which was required from Austrians by the Moscow Declaration. The other task of anti-fascist propaganda was to find a new ideology that could be relied on by a morally and financially exhausted nation.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104}} Anti-fascist rhetoric, forced from above, ran through the whole social life of Austria. Broken chains appeared on the [[coat of arms of Austria]] as a symbol of liberation of Austria from \"foreign occupation\" by Germany,{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}} memorial tablets and modest temporary monuments in honour of perished anti-fascists were installed in towns{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=209}} (the only big monument of this period, [[Soviet War Memorial (Vienna)|Heroes' Monument of the Red Army in Vienna]], was erected due to insistence of the USSR).{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=210}} Propaganda at all levels praised feats of a few anti-fascist heroes, but carefully avoided the topics of Austrian Jews and extermination camps.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=43}} The \"victim theory\" of this period, that ended not later than 1949, was based on four statements:{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}}\n* the Anschluss of 1938 has not been a union of the German nation, but a violent seizure of Austria by a foreign aggressor;\n* 1938\u20131945 should be considered a period of foreign occupation;\n* despite having been supressed by the occupiers, the Austrian resistance made a prominent contribution to the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition;\n* Austrian soldiers of the Wehrmacht were forced to serve under a threat of cruel terror.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}}\n\nAn informal ideology constructed from an anti-fascist openly left position was adopted by the Union of Concentration Camps Prisoners ({{lang-de|KZ-Verband}}).{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} This organisation pursued an aim to take control of the government and insisted that only active anti-fascists should be considered true victims of the regime thus closing their doors to \"passive victims\" \u2013 above all Jews who returned from the camps.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} [[Simon Wiesenthal]] accused KZ-Verband of continuing the \"only for Aryans\" practice that was accepted in Austrian parties before Anschluss \u2013 of copying Nazi [[Identification in Nazi camps|division of inmates into \"upper\" and \"lower\" categories]].{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} The position of KZ-Verband determined the contents of the first Austrian laws about aid to Nazi victims.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} The Austrian government agreed not to offer them compensation, but solely an allowance and not for everyone - just to active participants of the resistance movement.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=32}} On the initiative of both social democrats and conservatives, this law was extended to victims of the Dollfuss-Schuschnigg regime (except National Socialists).

Soon after the Federal Elections of 1949 ({{lang-de|Nationalratswahl in \u00d6sterreich 1949}}), they were officially recognized as \"victims\" of denazification together with those who they themselves victimized.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}} In 1949 Rosa Jochmann, ideologist of social democrats, anti-fascist of the immediate past and former prisoner of [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp|Ravensbr\u00fcck]], presented the new doctrine in this way:\n<blockquote>We all were the victims of fascism. A soldier who has come through the war in its worst form at the front was the victim. The population of the home front, who has been afraid of waiting for air-raid alarm and who has been dreaming of getting rid of bombing horror, was the victim. Those who had to leave their motherland were the victims \u2026 and finally we, unprotected victims of the SS, inmates of prisons and camps, were the victims.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}}</blockquote>\n<blockquote>{{lang| de | Opfer des Faschismus waren wir alle.

Opfer waren jene, die die Heimat verlassen mussten, um das zumeist traurige Los des Emigranten auf sich zu nehmen, und Opfer waren schliesslich wir, die wir in Gefangnissen, Zuchthausern und Konzentrationslagern der SS ausgeliefert gewesen sind.}}<ref>{{cite book| author = Hammerstein, Katrin | chapter = Schuldige Opfer?

Austrian society rejected claims from these groups and portrayed them as attempts to enrich themselves at the expense of ''all'' the \"Nazis' victims\".{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}} The existence of these groups itself was an 'inconvenience': they reminded the great mass of Austrians about their criminal past, hence their erasure from the collective memory.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}} By 1949 installation of memorials to heroes of the resistance was no longer desirable, at least at the provinces. And by the beginning of the 1950s it was identified as being an antagonistic Communist propaganda.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=50}} Some of the previously installed monuments were removed (e.g. common graves in KZ Ebensee and Sankt-Florian{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=53}}), other were redesigned to replace \"provocative\" texts with \"neutral\" ones (e.g. memorial tablet in [[Innsbruck]] at the place of death of Franz Mair (Widerstandsk\u00e4mpfer) that was edited twice \u2013 the first time at the alleged request of German tourists, the second time \u2013 at the request of local Catholics{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=53}}). The ideas of anti-fascists, who were \"undermining the foundations\" while hundreds of Austrians were performing their \"sacred duty\" (even if under the banners of \"German occupiers\"), were finally discredited and condemned.{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=214}}\n\n=== Revanche ===\n\n[[File:BurghardBreitnerMattsee01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Burghard Breitner memorial in [[Mattsee]].

In 1949-1950 veteran societies ({{lang-de|Kameradschaft}}) appeared spontaneously all over the country.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=526}} For instance, by 1956 there were 56 veteran groupings in an under-populated region of Salzburg. In 1952 there were 300 groups uniting 60 thousand veterans in Styria.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=526}} These societies had an unequivocal support of all political parties without exception and they actively participated in local political life.{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=214}}{{sfn|Berg|1997|pp=530, 539}} War memorials that had been erected throughout the country \u2013 from the capital to small villages \u2013 became clear evidence of a full rehabilitation of Wehrmacht soldiers and SS forces. The peak of their construction was in the years 1949\u20131950s.{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=214}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=27}} Mass meetings of veterans became commonplace. The ban of wearing of German military uniform, that had been introduced in 1945, was demonstratively violated everywhere.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=530}} The Provisional Government nervously watched the rise of nationalism. On the one hand, veterans in Nazi uniform provoked the occupational powers.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=530}}; on the other hand, Austrian veterans made common cause with their German counterparts. The border of Austria and the [[Germany|FRG]] was practically open threatening a new, spontaneous Anschluss that was disturbing for the Allies too.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=531}} The government tried to prevent the statements of pro-German activists in the federal media,{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=530}} but did not dare to prosecute their political wing \u2013 the \"Union of Independent\".{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=533}} In the presidential elections of 1951 the former Nazi and the candidate of the \"Union\" Burghard Breitner got more than 15% of votes.<ref name=BB51/>\n\nIn 1955 Austrians managed to solicit the Allies to exclude the provisions of Austrian responsibility for Hitlerite crimes from the [[Austrian State Treaty]]. Earlier Israel has renounced its claims to Austria.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|pp=15\u201316}} After the sovereignty had been recovered and the occupational troops been pulled out, the Austrian conservative rhetoric reached its climax.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}} At last Austrians could openly express their attitude to the results of WWII: according to the \"victim theory\" of that period (1955-1962) the invasion of the victory states in 1945 was not a liberation, but a hostile occupation that superseded Hitlerite one.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}} From this point of view Austria had been a \"victim\" not only of Hitler, but also of the victorious occupiers.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=46}} The first of federal politicians to express this opinion in public was Figl during the celebrations of signing the Austrian State Treaty.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}}\n\nAustrian politicians thought that ultra-right forces would have quickly lost their influence in an independent state, but despite their estimations the veteran movement increased rapidly and took the role of a defender of the society from the \"red threat\"{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=534}} and a new commentator of the state ideology.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=27}} The distinction between the [[Austrian Armed Forces]] and the veteran societies, as it seemed to foreign observers, was smoothed away: employed officers openly wore Hitlerite uniform,{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=536}} the veterans claimed to have a right to carry arms and to create an armed volunteer corps.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=537}} Social democrats, who created the \"Union of Independent\" in 1949, were the first to realize the threat, but conservatives from the [[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]] prevented the attempts to restrain the veterans.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=540}} Only in 1960 conservatives became concerned with an unpredictable behaviour of people dressed in the Wehrmacht uniform so Austria banned to wear [[Swastika]].{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=540}}\n\n=== Conciliation ===\n\nThe fifteen years of [[Leopold Figl]] and [[Julius Raab]]'s conservative governments maintained a full and uncompromising denial of guilt of Austria and the Austrians in Hitlerite crimes.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}} In 1961 the power passed to the socialist government under [[Bruno Kreisky]]. Over the next several years (not later than 1962{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=95}}-1965{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}}), as the first post-war generation entered the social life, the state ideology softened. A process to return the Resistance heroes to the public conscience began. It was followed by a rival campaign of ultra-rightists with the opposite intent.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=57}} A political dialogue within the firmly consolidated and inflexible ruling elite was still not possible: protesting sentiments started to manifest themsleves in in both cultural and scientific spheres.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=120}} In 1963 historians and anti-fascists founded the national archive of the Resistance, in 1964 the federal government approved the construction of the first memorial for the victims of concentration camps in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]].{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} Austrian society interpreted these cautious steps as a challenge for the dominating ultra-right views{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=58}} and resisted such \"attempts to blacken the past\". During the shooting of a musical film [[The Sound of Music]], the plot of which unfolds just the times of the Anschluss and immediately after, the Authorities of [[Salzburg]] forbade the producers to decorate the streets of the city with Nazi symbols insisting that \"there had never been Nazis in Salzburg\".{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=104}} They retreated only after the producers threatened to use the true newsreels of the Nazi processions in Salzburg.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=104}} The film had a worldwide success, but failed in Austria.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}\n\nThe death of a 67-year old anti-fascist [[Ernst Kirchweger]], beaten to death on March 31, 1965 during a demonstration against Nazi professor [[Taras Borodajkewycz]] catalysed change.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=111}} The subsequent demonstrations of protest were unexpectedly supported by all the federal-level politicians{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} The elite no longer had any need for the politics of the ultra-right. Moreover, being afraid of a spontaneous movement to an authoritarian dictatorship, the elite preferred to distance themselves from the ultra-right.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} In the same year the first memorial for anti-fascists constructed by the federal powers was opened in [[Hofburg]].{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} By the beginning of the 1970s the \"victim theory\" had mutated again. Anti-fascists were now returned to the official pantheon, but honouring of the Wehrmacht soldiers was still predominant.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=57}} Open anti-Semitism surrendered its positions slowly: according to the 1969 poll the genocide of Jews has been firmly approved by 55% of [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] electorate, 30% of [[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]] electorate and 18% of [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SP\u00d6]] electorate (the question was \"Do you agree that during 1938-1945 the Jews got their come-uppance?\"; the results of the \"firmly agree\" answer are given here{{sfn|Pelinka|1989|p=255}}); by 1985 these proportions decreased by 45%, 25% and 16% respectively.{{sfn|Pelinka|1989|p=255}} All the political parties viewed the \"everyday life\" during the Nazi era with considerable tolerance, and they subsequently shaped it, intentionally or not, into legitimacy and even prestige.{{sfn|Pelinka|1989|p=255}}\n\nThe consensus reached in the 1960s was maintained into the following decade. The [[Protests of 1968]] in Vienna, jokingly called a \"tamed revolution\" ({{lang-de|Eine Zahme Revolution}}), had little consequences.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}} The post-war generation of Austrians, as compared to Germans of the same age, has appeared to be passive and has not tried to review the past in the same active manner; this generation did not direct politicians, but rather followed them.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=121}} The ruling social democrats, with the knowledge of Kreisky, continued both secret and obvious cooperation with former Nazis.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}} Episodic protests against Nazi officials gave no results. In 1970 a minister of Kreisky's government,  a former Untersturmf\u00fchrer of the SS Johann \u00d6llinger, was exposed by the West German press and had to resign.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=114}} Instead Kreisky (a Jew himself, who escaped to Sweden in 1938{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=25}}) appointed another former Nazi in his stead [[Oskar Weihs]].{{sfn|Art|2005|p=114}} In 1975 the case of a political ally of Kreisky, [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] president [[Friedrich Peter]], who had been an officer in the [[1 SS Infantry Brigade]] during WWII, was a turning point.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=59}} Austrian politicians solidly supported Peter and condemned [[Simon Wiesenthal]] who had exposed him. According to the Opinion Polls this viewpoint was supported by 59% of Austrians.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=115}} Kreisky blamed Wiesenthal for aiding and abetting [[Gestapo]] and called Austrians to reconciliation \u2013 all of them, as the Chancellor said, were the Nazis' victims.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=114}} The limit of criticism was discovered.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=59}}\n\n== Practical implementation ==\n\n=== End of denazification ===\nDenazification in Austria in comparison with other counties was soft and smooth: there was nothing like the internal ideological conflict, leading to the civil war in [[Greece]], or the political repressions experienced in Eastern Europe and [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=145}} Researchers pick out 3 or 4 stages of denazification:\n* April \u2013 May 1945: the occupying powers took sole charge of the [[lustration]] and criminal prosecution of former Nazis;\n* May 1945 \u2013 February 1946: Austrian \"people's courts\" ({{lang-de|Volksgericht}}) worked simultaneously with the above;\n* February 1946 \u2013 May 1948: Austrian powers carried out denazification alone.{{sfn|Deak|2006|pp=138\u2013139}}\nDuring the whole period \"people's courts\" tried 137 thousand cases and passed 43 capital sentences.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=24}}\n\nThe American occupiers conducted denazification firmly and consistently:{{sfn|Deak|2006|pp=130\u2013131, 139}} the bigger part of 18 thousand prosecuted Nazis was convicted in their sector.{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=139}} During the whole period of the occupation the Soviet powers arrested and prosecuted approximately 2000 Austrians, 1000 of them were removed to the USSR for trial and penal consequences, about 200 were executed (for \"espionage\", as a rule). Many more Nazis were detained by the Soviet powers and then handed to Austrian authorities.{{sfn|Bekes|2015|pp=22-23}} In the beginning, the Soviet powers were prepared to \"whitewash\" the \"less tainted\" Nazis with the hope that they would help to reinforce the Austrian communist party resources.{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=139}} But after the latter was defeated at the November elections in 1945, the Soviet powers abandoned the idea to \"export the revolution\" to Austria and ceased to rely on the Austrian communist party.{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=139}} The British sector of occupation, [[Carinthia]], was the one with the largest part of Nazis within the population. During the elections of 1949 rehabilitated Nazis made 18,8 % of Carinthia electorate; this compared with 9.9% in Vienna and 8.7% in [[Lower Austria]] and [[Burgenland]].{{sfn|Pelinka|1989|p=251}} Tensions between the bodies that prosecuted Hitlerites, and economic powers, that actively recruited former Nazi industrial and commercial managers, were never ending in the British sector.{{sfn|Knight|2007|pp=586\u2013587}} Mass lustration and post-war economic restoration appeared to be incompatible: there was not enough spotless people to fill all the urgent vacancies.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=93}}{{sfn|Knight|2007|pp=586\u2013587}} One third of judges in the \"people's courts\" were former Nazis;{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=140}} 80%, according to the Soviet information, of the [[gendarmerie]] of the British sector were former Nazis.{{sfn|Bekes|2015|pp=309\u2013310}} Austrian powers regularly reported about \"full denazification\" of one or another department, but in reality the \"cleaned out\" Nazis just were transferred from one position to another.{{sfn|Bekes|2015|pp=309\u2013310}} Political parties, including the Communists, actively accepted Nazis under the their patronage and protected them from the occupational powers and rival parties using the principle \"do not touch ours or we will attack yours\".{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|p=97}}\n\nAfter the [[Cold War]] started, the Austrian government used the dissension between the former Allies to promote a reconsideration of the value of denazification.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=93}} In May 1948 it was discontinued and a 9-year \"period of amnesties\" of former Nazis started.{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=139}} The victory states preferred civil peace and stability to righting a wrong and secretly agreed with the Austrian viewpoint.{{sfn|Deak|2006|pp=145\u2013146}}{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=93}} In 1955 \"people's courts\" were dismissed, Nazis' cases were passed to [[General jurisdiction|courts of general jurisdiction]], that in 1960 become notorious for verdicts of not guilty in resonant cases.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=24}} In mid-70s the prosecution of Nazis was officially stopped.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=24}}\n\n=== Denial of financial restitution ===\n\nIn the second half of 1945 about 4500 surviving Jews returned to Vienna.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=105}} Renner and his government, using the \"victim theory\" as a cover, refused to return them their property seized during the Nazi regime. All the responsibility to help former camp inmates was laid on to the [[Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien|Vienna Israelite Community]] and the\"[[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]]\".{{sfn|Bukey|2000|p=231}}{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=105}} According to the Financial Aid Law of July 17, 1945 Austria only supported \"active\" (political) prisoners, but not \"passive\" victims of ethnic cleansing.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104}} This support was limited to a modest allowance, there was no question of compensations for losses. Politicians justified this rejection of restitution both with ideological clich\u00e9s and the real weakness of the new state that was established from the ruins of the defeated Reich.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}} According to Figl all that had  happened in Austria was similar to a natural disaster. Austria was not capable of either recouping the losses, or even easing the miseries of people who had suffered during those years.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}}\n\nUntil the end of 1990s public policy of the Second Republic in terms of restitution was defined by the \"victim theory\". Procrastination of legislative decisions on the matter and bureaucracy during their administration became an unwritten practical rule. The first to formulate it was the Minister of Internal Affairs [[Oscar Helmer]] (one of few politicians who have admitted the responsibility of Austrians) in 1945: \"Ich bin daf\u00fcr, die Sache in die L\u00e4nge zu ziehen\" (\"I think that this question should be dragged out\").<ref>Helmer announced this on a closed session of the provisional government. For the first time these words were published by Robert Nite in 1988. His work provoked a new round of political discussion about Austrian evasion of responsibility.{{harvnb|Art|2005|p=108}}{{harvnb|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=29}}</ref> All the legislative decisions concerning restitution were passed only under pressure from the allied occupational powers and later \u2013 after 1955 \u2013 by the US and Jewish social organizations.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=308}} Austrian legislation has developed in fits and starts from one foreign policy crisis to another.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=122}} In the beginning Austrians resisted and tried to develop another consensual decision, haggled for mutual concessions,{{refn|1=For instance, in 1952 Austria made the recognition of Israel conditional on withdrawal of Israel's material charges to Austria{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=100}}}} and then silently sabotaged the decision.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=311}} Successful completion of legislative initiatives to recognise rights of one or another group was determined by the political weight of its activists:{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|pp=35, 36\u201337}} for half a century the priority was to get pensions and allowances for Wehrmacht veterans. Jews and Gypsies got formal recognition in 1949,{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=34}} [[Doctors' trial|medical crimes]] victims \u2013 only in 1995, homosexuals and asexuals \u2013 in 2005.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=35}}\n\nAs a result, Austrian law that regulated restitution to victims turned out to be a complicated and controversial \"patchwork quilt\" made of  a multitude of acts on separate cases.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=308}} The law of 1947 about social assistance to the victims of repressions had been corrected 30 times during 50 years.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=107}} For some incidental points like the restitution of confiscated property Austrians formed a fair and fully-fledged legal basis as early as 1947. The other ones, like the lost rights of rented apartments,{{refn|1=During 1938\u20131939 no less than 59 thousand apartments occupied by Jews were \"aryanised\" in Vienna alone. The restitution of the lost rights to rent as such was rejected by all the generations of Austrian politicians under the pretext that it should have required eviction of tens of thousands of new tenants therefore leading to mass disorders.

The consensual opinion of Austrian academics was that a common language could not be the determining factor.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=108}}\n\nDuring the first post-war decades historical perspectives within Austria, like the society as a whole, was separated into two-party columns \u2013 conservative and social-democratic,{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=97-98}} who however together wrote the consensual (\"coalitionist\", {{lang-de|Koalitionsgeschichtsschreibung}}) history under administration of the party supervisors.{{sfn|Ritter|1992|p=113}} Probably there was no alternative during those years: simply no humanitarian or ideological schools existed outside of the party camps.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|p=98}} Both the schools fabricated the [[contemporary history]] in their own way, supporting the all-nation \"victim\" myth.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=95, 98}} Conservative historians hid [[Leopold Kunschak]]'s anti-Semitism, social democrats were silent about Renner's sycophancy before Stalin and Hitler.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=95, 98}} The competing groups never tried to expose each other, they continued to mutually respect the party legends and taboos for 3 decades.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=99}} [[Anton Pelinka]] thought that denying and silencing the historical reality allowed for the first time in history, a consolidation of society and healing of the wounds of the past.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=99}}\n\nIn the 1970s historians, following the political order, focused on investigation of the interwar period; the Nazi regime being interpreted as absolution from sins of the First Republic and still within the boundaries of the \"victim theory\".{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=59}} Authors of the standard \"History of Austria\" (1977) Gorlich and Romanik stated that WWII belonged to world history, it was not an Austrian war because Austria as a state did not participate in it.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=48}} Along with this, Austrian patriots knew that the path to Austrian national revival laid through Hitler's defeat.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=48}} Austria's own history was considered separate to a common one with Germany;{{sfn|Ritter|1992|p=113}} by 1980 the belief that a special, \"non-German\" national identity of Austrians had long existed, became firmly established.{{sfn|Ritter|1992|p=113}} The Austrian lineage of [[Odilo Globocnik]], [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], [[Adolf Eichmann]] and other Nazi criminals was suppressed: the historians called them German occupiers.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=45}} The only existing (as of 2007) [[monograph]] about denazification in Austria (Dieter Stiefel, 1981) described it as an unfounded and incompetent intervention of the victors into home affairs.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=572}} Left-wing historians, in their turn, criticised the Allies for supposed suppression of a spontaneous anti-fascist movement, which had no appreciable influence in reality.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=572}}\n\n=== School syllabi ===\n\nOne of the methods to consolidate the ideology became school syllabi,{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=109}} where the \"victim\" myth was closely interwoven with the myth about a special, non-German identity of Austrians.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|pp=111}} The highest goal of the Austrian school system became a patriotic education in a spirit of national union that required forgetting the immediate past and forgiving the past sins of all compatriots.\n\nTextbooks presented the Anschluss as an act of German aggression against innocent \"victims\" and methodically shifted blame to other countries, who gave Austria up during the hard times.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}} The first textbooks blamed the western countries for [[Appeasement#The conduct of appeasement, 1937\u201339|appeasement of Hitler]].{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}} In the 1960s the USSR temporarily became the main villain whom ''Austrians'' fought against in a ''just'' war.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=141}} Until the 1970s the existence of Austrian support for the Anschluss as well as Austrian Nazism was denied: according to the textbooks Austrian society was a solid mass, of which every member equally was a \"victim\" of foreign forces.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}}{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|pp=201, 202}} Authors of a 1955 school reading book ignored the concept of Anschluss ('union'): Austria was literally presented as a victim of German ''military'' aggression, just like Poland or France.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}} Books of 1950s and 1960s mentioned the Holocaust rarely and in a reduced form of a minor episode.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=202}} The topic of a traditional Austrian anti-Semitism and its role in the events of 1938-1945 were never discussed; from the authors' point of view the persecution of Jews had been an exclusive consequence of Hitler's personal animosity.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=202}} In the 1960s a typical clich\u00e9 of Austrian school programmes was an indispensable comparison of the Holocaust and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] or sometimes [[Katyn massacre]]. But the description of the catastrophes in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were more prominentt than the description of the events inside Austria itself.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|pp=202\u2013206}} School impressed the idea that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were not been any better than [[Axis powers]], and Nazi crimes were not anything extreme.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|pp=202\u2013206}}\n\nThe first textbooks to give a real, historical picture of events, not the myth, were published in Austria only in 1982 and 1983. Authors for the first time discussed the problem of anti-Semitism in their contemporary society and were first to admit that Hitlerite anti-Semitism had national, Austrian roots.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=202}} Other textbooks of 1980s continued to diligently reproduce the \"victim\" myth. They mentioned the existence of concentration camps, but their description was reduced to just a ''political'' prosecution of a ''political'' enemies of Hitler;{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=204}} the books considered the camps as a place where consolidation of the national elite has happened, a personnel department of the Second Republic in its own way.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=141}} The Holocaust was mentioned but was never classified as [[genocide]];  there were no absolute figures of exterminated people: Austrian school invented the \"Holocaust without Jews\".{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=205}} Only in 1990s authors of textbook admitted the real scale of the crimes, but kept the comparison of the Holocaust with Hiroshima. The two catastrophes still co-existed and were continuously compared, and Austrians who committed evil acts were still presented as passive executors of foreign will.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=209}}\n\n== Historical role ==\n\nAll the countries that suffered under Nazi power tried more or less to forget their own past after the war.{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=208}} Ones that had a resistance movement glorified it, forgetting about [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|collaborationism]]. Others, like Austria, preferred to consider themselves victims of the foreign aggression,{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=208}}{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}} although Austria, itself, did have a [[Austrian Resistance|resistance movement]] (The Resistance in Austria, 1938\u20131945 Radom\u00edr Luza, University of Minnesota Press, 1984). According to the opinion of American politologist David Art, the Austrian \"white lies\" about being a \"victim\" served four important purposes:\n\n* For the first time in modern history the two rival political forces \u2013 conservatives and social democrats \u2013 united around this issue. The common rhetoric of being a \"victim\" allowed the country to forget the [[Austrian Civil War|Civil War]] of the 1930s; mutual silence about the sins of the past helped to establish trust relationships between the two parties. The \"big coalition\" of conservatives, social democrats, church and trade unions, formed in the 1940s ruled the country for almost half a century;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}}\n* The recognition of all Austrians as \"victims\" allowed the integratione of the former Nazis (1/6 of all adults in the country{{sfn|Bekes|2015|p=308}}) into social and political life;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=109}}\n* Distancing from the German \"occupiers\" was essential to build Austrian national identity.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}} Austrians of 1920s-1930s considered themselves Germans and being a part of the Reich for 8 years just confirmed their beliefs.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}} Politicians of 1940s understood that the so called \"Austrian nation\" never existed, but they needed an ideology to form a core of national identity \u2013 the \"victim theory\" was the one to solve the problem;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}}\n* The \"victim theory\" allowed the postponmento and delay of restitution for half a century.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=108}} Industrial assets that had been taken from Jews during Hitler times and nationalized by the Second Republic, became the part of an economical foundation of postwar Austria.{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}}\n\n== Dismantling of the myth ==\n\n=== Waldheim affair ===\n\nIn 1985 the \u00d6VP political party nominated the former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UNSG]] [[Kurt Waldheim]] for the federal president election.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=115}} During WWII Waldheim [[Kurt Waldheim#Military service in World War II|served as an intelligence officer]] in the Wehrmacht within the occupied territories of the USSR, Greece and Yugoslavia. West German and later Austrian and American journalists and the [[World Jewish Congress|WJC]] accused Waldheim of being a member of Nazi organizations and of passive co-operation in punitive actions in the Balkans.{{sfn|Art|2005|pp=118, 132}} Waldheim denied all the accusations and insisted that the campaign of defamation has been directed not towards him in person, but towards all his generation.{{sfn|Art|2005|pp=118, 121}} The president of WJC [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.|Edgar Bronfman]] acknowledged this: \"The issue is not Kurt Waldheim. He is a mirror of Austria. His lies are of secondary importance. The real issue is that Austria has lied for decades about its own involvement in the atrocities Mr. Waldheim was involved in: deportations, reprisal murders, and others too painful to think about\".{{sfn|Art|2005|p=118}} The Waldheim affair captivated the country, an unprecedented discussion about the military past developed in the press.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=118}} At the beginning of it the conservatives, who absolutely dominated in Austrian media, {{sfn|Art|2005|p=121}} formulated a new \"victim theory\" that was the first in history to apply to the patriotism of Austrians.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=120}} From the right-wing's point of view both Austria and Waldheim personally became victims of the campaign of defamation by the world Jewry, therefore support for Waldheim should be a duty for all patriots.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=120}} The questions about Hitlerite past were interpreted as an attack against patriotic feelings of Austrians; the right-wingers insisted that during WWII Austrians behaved respectably, so digging the past up was unneeded and harmful.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=120}}\n\nThe electoral campaign of Waldheim was built on a call to Austrian national feelings. Waldheim won the elections in the second round of voting, but he was not able to perform his main responsibility as the president of Austria \u2013 diplomatic representation.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=117}} The USA and later European countries boycotted Waldheim.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=117}} Austria got a reputation of a promoter of Nazism and a foe to Israel. European organisations continuously criticised the country for its support of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].{{sfn|Pick|2000|pp=197\u2013199}} In order to rehabilitate the president, the Austrian government founded an independent commission of historians. In February 1988 they confirmed accusations against Waldheim: while not being the direct executor or the organizer of war crimes, it was impossible for him not to know about them.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=117}} The direct result of the Waldheim affair in home policy was the defeat of the social democrats and the factual break-up of the postwar two-party system.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=119}} The[[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Green Party]] appeared on the political scene and the radical right-wing [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] under [[J\u00f6rg Haider]] grew in strength. The system of mutual taboos collapsed and politicians were no more obliged to keep silence about rivals' affairs.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=119}}\n\n=== Left-wing opposition ===\n\n[[File:Wien - Innere Stadt - Mahnmal gegen Krieg und Faschismus - Stra\u00dfen waschender Jude.jpg|thumb|right|240px|\"A Jew forced to clean the street\" \u2013 a part of the memorial against wars and fascism at Albertinaplatz, 1988.]]\n\nDomestic opposition to the ideology represented by Waldheim arose from the circles of liberal-left intellectuals, far from the political power of the influential mass media.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=130}} During the latter decades of the 20th century the left movement mobilised.

A year later public apologies were made by the new conservative president [[Thomas Klestil]].{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}}\n\nThe \"victim theory\" had now been completely abandoned,{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=89}} at least at the level of the highest organs of government. Nobody has doubted the will of Vranitzky and Klestil, but sceptics doubted if the Austrian nation was ready to share their position.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=200}} Conservative politicians had no desire to support this new ideology{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=200}} and the influence of FP\u00d6 party swiftly increased. The unification of the left and right happened only in 2000 during another crisis in foreign politics caused by the FP\u00d6's electoral victory.{{sfn|Berger|2012|pp=116}} This time Austria was not only under the pressure from the US and Jewish organisations but also the European Union.{{sfn|Berger|2012|pp=117\u2013118}} Unexpectedly, Austria's integration in the EU appeared to be more vulnerable than in the 1980s.{{sfn|Berger|2012|pp=117\u2013118}} Politicians had to make concessions once again: under the insistence of Klestil the leaders of the parliamentary parties signed another declaration on the Austrian responsibility and approved a new roadmap towards satisfying the claims of victims of National Socialism.{{sfn|Berger|2012|pp=116}} The work of the Austrian Historical Commission ({{lang-de|\u00d6sterreichische Historikerkommission}}) resulted in admission of the economical \"aryanisation\" of 1938\u20131941 as a part of the [[Holocaust]] (that was equal to unconditional consent for restitution);{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=93}} Under the [[Washington Agreement (2001)|Washington Agreement]] signed with Austrian government and industry, Austria admitted its debts towards Jews ($480 mln) and [[Ostarbeiters]] ($420 mln).{{sfn|Karn|2015|pp=100\u2013101}} For the first time in Austrian history, this programme of restitution was fulfilled within the shortest possible time.{{sfn|Berger|2012|pp=116}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book|last1=Poltavsky|first1=M.

According to the interpretation of this slogan by the founders of the Second Austrian Republic, the ''[[Anschluss]]'' which occurred in 1938 was an act of military aggression by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Austrian statehood had been interrupted and therefore the newly revived Austria of 1945 could not and should not be considered responsible for the [[Nuremberg trials|Nazis' crimes]] in any way. The \"[[victim theory]]\" which was formed by 1949 ({{lang-de|Opferthese, Opferdoktrin}}) insisted that all of the Austrians, including those who strongly supported [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], had been unwilling victims of the Nazi regime and were therefore not responsible for its crimes.\n\nThe \"victim theory\" became a fundamental myth in Austrian society. It made it possible for previously bitter political opponents \u2013 i.e. the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|social democrats]] and the [[Austrian People's Party|conservative Catholics]] \u2013 to unite and bring former Nazis back into social and political life for the first time in [[History of Austria|Austrian history]]. For almost half a century, the Austrian state denied the existence of any continuity between it and the political regime which existed in Austria from 1938\u20131945, actively kept up the self-sacrificing myth of Austrian nationhood, and cultivated a conservative spirit of national unity. Postwar [[denazification]] was quickly wound up; veterans of the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Waffen-SS]] took an honorable place in society. The struggle for justice by the actual victims of [[Nazism]] \u2013 first of all [[Jews]] \u2013 was deprecated as an attempt to obtain illicit enrichment at the expense of the entire nation.\n\nIn 1986, the election of a former Wehrmacht intelligence officer, [[Kurt Waldheim]], as a [[List of Federal Presidents of Austria|federal president]] put Austria on the verge of international isolation. Powerful outside pressure and an internal political discussion forced Austrians to reconsider their attitude to the past. Starting with the political administration of the 1990s and followed by most of the Austrian people by the mid-2000s, the nation admitted its collective responsibility for the crimes committed during the Nazi occupation and officially abandoned the \"victim theory\".\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{Main|Anschluss|German nationalism in Austria|German Confederation|German Question|Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|280px|A map of the German Confederation.]]\nThe idea of grouping all [[Germans]] into a nation-state country had been the subject of debate in the 19th century from the ending of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the ending of the [[German Confederation]]. The [[Habsburgs]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] favored the ''Gro\u00dfdeutsche L\u00f6sung'' (\"Greater German solution\") idea of uniting all German-speaking peoples into one-state. On the other hand, the ''Kleindeutsche L\u00f6sung'' (\"Lesser German solution\") sought only to unify the northern German states and not include Austria; this proposal was largely advocated by the inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Geiss|first=Imanuel|title=The Question of German Unification: 1806-1996|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415150491|page=38}}</ref> The Prussians defeated the Austrians in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866 which ultimately excluded Austria and the Austrian Germans from Germany. [[Otto von Bismarck]] established the [[North German Confederation]] which sought to prevent the Austrian and Bavarian Catholics from forming any sort of force against the predominantly Protestant Prussian Germany. He used the [[Franco-Prussian War]] to convince other German states, including the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] to fight against the [[Second French Empire]]. After Prussia's victory in the war, he swiftly [[Unification of Germany|unified Germany]] into a nation-state in 1871 and proclaimed the [[German Empire]], without Austria.<ref>{{cite book|author=James J.

During its existence, the German-speaking Austrians hoped for the empire to dissolve and advocated an ''Anschluss'' with Germany. Following the dissolution of the empire in 1918, the rump state of [[Republic of German-Austria|German-Austria]], was created. Immediately following the publication of humiliating terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] a drive for unification with Germany appeared, but its practical actions were strictly suppressed by [[Triple Entente|victory states]].

During 1942\u20131943 the attitude of the Allies to the Austrian question changed: the leaders of the USSR had not suggested any new scheme, while the British took into serious consideration the future Austria.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=26}} On September 26, 1942 Eden declared Churchill's plan of creation of a \"Danube confederation\" composed of former Austria, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia \u2013 a vast buffer state that would have separated Western Europe from the USSR.{{sfn|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1973|p=138}}{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} In the Spring of 1943, a 34 year old civil servant in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign office]] [[Geoffrey Harrison]] deveoped a plan for the post-war organisation of Austria, which subsequently became the official British policy in regard to the Austrian question.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=27, 33}} Harrison's viewpoint was that recreation of an independent but weak Austria within the borders of the First Republic was only possible with the readiness of the Western allies to support the new state for many years long.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=31}} Harrison did not believe in the ability of the Austrians to self-organize nor in the probability them rising in armed resistance against the regime.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=138\u2013139}} The best solution according to British point of view would have been a strong confederation of Danube states with Austria included de jure as an equal member, but de facto as a cultural and political leader.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|pp=31\u201332}} It was not possible to create such a union in the immediate post war Europe; an independent Austria would have to be created first, and it should have been provided with political guarantees and financial support. Only afterwards a political union could have been developed step-by-step.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=33}}\n\nSoviet historiography of 1970s called the British project an attempt to \"push through the idea of a new Anschluss\".{{sfn|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1973|p=138}} As M. A. Poltavsky wrote, the Allies pursued the aim to \"create a conglomeration of regions in Europe that would have become a constant seat of conflicts\".{{sfn|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1973|p=138}} There are two points of view on the motives of British politicians in the contemporary western historiography.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} The traditional one considers their actions solely as an instrument to protect British concerns and to oppose the USSR in the postwar German break up.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} According to the alternative point by R. Keyserling, the British were mainly guided by erroneous utopian plans to foment a mass resistance against Nazi regime in Austrian lands, to disrupt German Reich from the inside and to create a convenient springboard for attack from the South.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}}{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|p=157}} Both the points of view support that in 1943 British as well as American politics mistakenly thought that Germany has been ready to collapse under pressure from the Soviet troops or from people's indignation from the inside of Reich.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=132\u2013133}}{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=27}}\n\n=== Text endorsements ===\n\nAt the end of May 1943 Harrison's plan was approved by the British cabinet,{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=33}} but by June [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] had let the Foreign Office know that any association or confederation of Danube states were not acceptable to the USSR.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} Molotov's deputy, [[Solomon Lozovsky]], decried such a union calling it \"the instrument of anti-Soviet politics\".{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} The British did not abandon the plan, so on August 14, 1943 Eden sent the Harison's project of the \"Declaration on Austria\" to Moscow and Washington. The text started by stating that \"Austria was the first free country to fall victim to Nazi aggression\u2026.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=33}} Again, facing resistance of Soviet diplomats the British started to back down. According to Soviet insistence the project lost any mention of association with neighbouring states and [[Atlantic Charter]], the \"Austrian nation\" was replaced with an unambiguous \"Austria\", \"Nazi aggression\" \u2013 with \"Hitlerite aggression\".{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} The British negotiations with the Americans were not any less difficult.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|p=145}}\n\nThe [[Moscow Declarations#Declaration on Austria|Moscow Declaration on Austria]] became the result of this haggling between the Allied ministers.{{sfn|Steininger|2012|p=36}} It was adopted on September 30th and published on November 1st, 1943. Despite all the edits made, the phrase \"the first victim\" remained practically untouched: \"Austria, the first free country to fall a victim to Hitlerite aggression, shall be liberated from German domination\u2026\". The text was finished with a strict reminder, which was insisted by Stalin, that Austria \"has a responsibility, which she cannot evade, for participation in the war on the side of Hitlerite Germany\" ([[:s:en:Moscow Declarations#Declaration on Austria|full text]]). According to Stalin's addendum the responsibility was not lying on the shoulders of certain people, groups or parties, but the society in whole; there was no way for an Austrian to escape from collective responsibility.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} Stalin, like Churchill, had also considered Austria to be a buffer between Soviet and Anglo-American spheres of influence, and [[Communist International#Dissolution|has not been in a hurry to carry out]] the \"[[export of revolution]]\".{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} His short-term goal was to exploit the surviving Austrian industrial, human and natural resources; probably that's why Stalin insisted on the stricter wording concering responsibility.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=19}} The authors are unlikely to have suspected \"the first victim\" would become an Austrian national theme, which would be carefully cultivated and protected, and determine Austrian foreign policy for many years.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=18}} Moreover, they didn't know that another part of the Declaration \u2013 the Austrian responsibility \u2013 would die on the vine.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=18}}\n\n=== Response of belligerent Austrians ===\n\nDifferent historical schools admit that defeats in 1943 gave rise to doubt amongst the Austrians about the future of the Reich and helped the spread of separatist sentiments.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} But they disagree on the role of this sentiment in history. According to the official post-war Austrian point of view the defeat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] started a fully fledged \"national awakening\".{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} Soviet historians insisted that in 1943 a new stage of [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] began in Austria, and the Moscow Declaration proved to be an \"important factor that influenced the Austrian nation\".{{sfn|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|1973|p=135}} Contemporary Western historians believe that there is no reason for drawing firm conclusions about \"awakening\" or \"resistance\".{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=186}} It goes without saying that antihitlerite and separatist sentiments had been spreading both in Vienna and remote places of Austria, but nearly in the same degree as in other lands of the Reich.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|pp=186, 188, 193}} War defeats, Italian withdrawal from war, Anglo-American bombings,    streams of refugees and prisoners facilitated this, but Western historians deny the influence of the Moscow Declaration. Evan Bukey admits that the Declaration inspired the Austrian underground, but neither increased their forces nor helped to spread separatist sentiments.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} R. Keyserlingk wrote that the Declaration brought the Allies more harm than good.{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=159\u2013160}} The operation of British propagandists among Austrian soldiers at the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian front]] failed :{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=36}} the Moscow Declaration has not influenced the fighting spirit of German troops and, probably, merely was a great help for Goebbels' [[counterpropaganda]].{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|pp=159\u2013160}}\n\nAustria was far behind the lines of belligerent Germany and the reaction of Austrian civilians on the Moscow Declaration was twofold.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} On one hand, people made a false conclusion that the status of \"the first victim\" will help Austria to avoid allied bombings.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} On the other hand, \"Moscow\" in the title was unmistakably associated not with the western allies, but with uncompromising [[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}} People, in whole, were indifferent to the news and did not support any anti-Hitler opposition groups.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=208}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=104}} During 1943\u20131944 the number of arrests increased, but 80% of arrested were foreign workers, whose number was 140 thousand in Vienna alone.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=205}} During 1944, as the military and economical landscape got worse, dissatisfaction increased among Austrians too, but not with the Hitler regime, but with the stream of refugees, especially Protestants, \"from the North\".{{sfn|Bukey|2002|pp=197, 198, 206}} Internal conflicts did not undermine the fighting spirit of the nation. Quite the contrary, the success of the Allies and reactivation of air bombings of Austria only consolidated its population around the figure of the Fuehrer.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=209}}{{sfn|Keyserlingk|1990|p=163}} During the unsuccessful [[20 July plot]] people of Vienna fully supported Hitler.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=213}}\n\n== Declaration of 'Victimhood' ==\n[[File:Heldendenkmal der Roten Armee, Schwarzenbergplatz Wien 3.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[Soviet War Memorial (Vienna)|Heroes' Monument of the Red Army in Vienna]]. The phrase \"\u2026in battle against the German fascist invaders\" carved on the stone tablet in front of the monument, from the Austrian politicians' point of view, confirmed innocence of Austrians.{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=210}}]]\n\nOn April 13, 1945 the Soviet troops [[Vienna Offensive|captured Vienna]]. Two weeks later, on April 27, the Provisional Government, formed by the Soviet forces under [[Karl Renner]], promulgated the \"Proclamation of the Second Republic of Austria\", which literally reprinted the text of the Moscow Declaration.{{sfn|Steininger|2008|pp=43\u201344}} Renner, who had previously been an active supporter of the Anschluss,{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=44}} still considered it a historical necessity, and  expressed his regret over the forced separation of Austria and Germany under the pressure of the Allies in his address to the nation. The majority of Austrians agreed with him.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=227}} But the proclamation of April 27, which was addressed not so much to the nationals as to the victory states, declared the opposite: events of 1938 were not the result of agreement between equal parties or expression of the popular will, but the result of \"an uncovered external pressure, a terrorist plot by own National Socialist [Nazi] minority, deception and blackmail during talks, and then \u2013 an open military occupation \u2026 The Adolf Hitler's Third Reich deprived people of Austria of their power and freedom to express their will, led them to a senseless and pointless massacre, which no one Austrian has not wanted to take part in.\"<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.cvce.eu/en/collections/unit-content/-/unit/02bb76df-d066-4c08-a58a-d4686a3e68ff/19940f1c-07c9-41b6-a443-0f0b74c15042/Resources#a49eaade-2468-46fd-80ad-000d471beb0b_de&overlay | title=Proclamation of the Second Republic of Austria (Vienna, 27 April 1945) | publisher=Le Gouvernement du Grand-Duche de Luxembourg | quote=}}</ref>{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}}\n\nThe proclamation of April 27 gingerly repudiated the claim of the Moscow declaration about Austria's own contribution to its liberation: since, as the fathers of the Second Republic asserted, during 1938\u20131945s the Austrian statehood had been temporarily interrupted, the revived Austria should not have been responsible for crimes of \"invaders\".{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=18}}{{sfn|Uhl|1997|pp=65\u201366}} In May\u2013June 1945 the Provisional Government recorded this proposition in an official \"doctrine of the occupation\" ({{lang-de|Okkupationsdoktrin}}).{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=18}} All the guilt and responsibility for the crimes of occupation regime was laid at the door of Germany \u2013 the only successor of the Hitlerite Reich.{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=18}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=25}} The position of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Austria on the Jewish question became a practical consequence of this doctrine: as there had not been Austrians to persecute Jews, but German occupiers, then \"according to the international law Austrian Jews should submit their claims for reparations not to Austria, but to German Reich\".{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=16}} The Foreign Minister of Austria [[Karl Gruber]] organized the compilation and publishing of \"{{ill|Red-White-Red Book|de|Rot-Wei\u00df-Rot-Buch}}\" in order to persuade the victorious Allied Powers.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=229}}{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=19}} The intent of the Austrian politicians, in publishing this collection of real documents and \"historical comments\" that were selectively compiled, was to persuade the victorious Allied Powers of the forced nature of the Anschluss (that was true) and also in a mass rejection of Hitler regime by Austrians (that was not true).{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=229}} The book was planned to have more than one volume. But the second volume, the \"story of Austrian resistance\", was not published: according to the official version not enough archive evidence was found.{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=19}} The authors affirmed, for instance, that in 1938 70% of Austrians had not simply been against Anschluss, but they were said to feel a \"fanatic animosity\" against it.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=229}} This is how the myth was established to later become an ideological foundation of the postwar Austria.{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=13}}{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=19}}\n\nFounders of the Second Republic probably had a moral right to consider themselves to be victims of political repressions.{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=14}} Twelve of the seventeen members of the Cabinet of [[Leopold Figl]], that headed the government in December 1945, were persecuted under Dollfuss, Schuschnigg and Hitler. Figl himself was imprisoned in [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]{{sfn|Steininger|2008|p=14}} and for this reason he was insolent towards emigrants who had \"escaped from difficulties\".{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|p=97}} So this is not surprising that the myth of \"the road to Dachau\" ({{lang-de|Der Geist der Lagerstrasse}}) followed \"the first victim\" myth:{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}} according to this legend during their imprisonment Austrian politicians came up with the agreement to stop interparty squabbles and to unite forever for the sake of building a new and democratic Austria.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|pp=25, 26}} Representatives of the major parties of the First Republic \u2013 [[Austrian People's Party|conservatives]], [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|social democrats]] and [[Communist Party of Austria|communists]] \u2013 did unite, but only in the beginning of April 1945.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|pp=25, 26}} According to the contemporary point of view, the politicians were united not because of conscious choice, but for the need to survive in harsh postwar conditions and intentional pressure from the [[Allied-occupied Austria|Allied occupational powers]].{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|pp=25, 26}} The statement about \"all-nation unity\" of all Austrians in the cause of post-war reconstruction, being essential for the country to survive and revive, became the third fundamental myth. In actual fact not less important for Austria to survive was the political and [[Marshall Plan|financial support from the USA]].{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=26}}\n\n== Evolution of 'Victimhood' ideology ==\n\n=== Anti-fascist period ===\nAn anti-fascist spirit dominated Austrian public politics for two post-war years. Propaganda of the feats of the Austrian resistance proved to the Allies the contribution made to the defeat of Nazism, which was required from Austrians by the Moscow Declaration. The other task of anti-fascist propaganda was to find a new ideology that could be relied on by a morally and financially exhausted nation.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104}} Anti-fascist rhetoric, forced from above, ran through the whole social life of Austria. Broken chains appeared on the [[coat of arms of Austria]] as a symbol of liberation of Austria from \"foreign occupation\" by Germany,{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}} memorial tablets and modest temporary monuments in honour of perished anti-fascists were installed in towns{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=209}} (the only big monument of this period, [[Soviet War Memorial (Vienna)|Heroes' Monument of the Red Army in Vienna]], was erected due to insistence of the USSR).{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=210}} Propaganda at all levels praised feats of a few anti-fascist heroes, but carefully avoided the topics of Austrian Jews and extermination camps.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=43}} The \"victim theory\" of this period, that ended not later than 1949, was based on four statements:{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}}\n* the Anschluss of 1938 has not been a union of the German nation, but a violent seizure of Austria by a foreign aggressor;\n* 1938\u20131945 should be considered a period of foreign occupation;\n* despite having been supressed by the occupiers, the Austrian resistance made a prominent contribution to the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition;\n* Austrian soldiers of the Wehrmacht were forced to serve under a threat of cruel terror.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=41}}\n\nAn informal ideology constructed from an anti-fascist openly left position was adopted by the Union of Concentration Camps Prisoners ({{lang-de|KZ-Verband}}).{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} This organisation pursued an aim to take control of the government and insisted that only active anti-fascists should be considered true victims of the regime thus closing their doors to \"passive victims\" \u2013 above all Jews who returned from the camps.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} [[Simon Wiesenthal]] accused KZ-Verband of continuing the \"only for Aryans\" practice that was accepted in Austrian parties before Anschluss \u2013 of copying Nazi [[Identification in Nazi camps|division of inmates into \"upper\" and \"lower\" categories]].{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} The position of KZ-Verband determined the contents of the first Austrian laws about aid to Nazi victims.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=31}} The Austrian government agreed not to offer them compensation, but solely an allowance and not for everyone - just to active participants of the resistance movement.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=32}} On the initiative of both social democrats and conservatives, this law was extended to victims of the Dollfuss-Schuschnigg regime (except National Socialists). The \"passive victims\", especially emigrants, were not eligible for the allowance.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=32}} The legislators followed simple interests and helped only those from whom they could expect political assistance.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104}} Several thousands of surviving Jews were of no interest, as opposed to hundreds of thousands of front-line soldiers and Nazis.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104: \u00abthe Jewish victims could not be politically instrumentalized\u00bb}}\n\n=== Change of direction ===\n\nAlready in 1946 it became clear that leftist anti-fascist propaganda was not being accepted in Austrian society, so by 1947 its time was over.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104}}{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=44}} Prisoners, who returned from allied detention, were surprised to find that Austrians \"forgot\" about the years of Hitler's regime. A patriotic upsurge appeared in the country and replaced bitter memories.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=229}} In 1947 the Allies began the mass liberation of captivated Austrians and Austrian government restored half a million of \"less tainted\" ({{lang-de|Minderbelastete}}) members of the former NSDAP (Nazi party) to their civil rights.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=44}} From that moment a political struggle for the votes of former Nazis and veterans became a governing trait of Austrian political life. [[Austrian People's Party|Conservatives]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|social democrats]] rejected anti-fascist rhetoric, while communists, who supported it, quickly lost their political weight. In the beginning of 1947 they lost their places in government, the police closed the 'KZ-Verband' at the end of that year.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|pp=24, 31}} [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat|\"February 1948\" events in Czechoslovakia]] and threat of \"export of revolution\" deprived communists of all their former influence.{{sfn|Bischof|2004|p=20}} A three-party coalition changed to a classical two-party system; the \"[[Federation of Independents]]\" now took the role of a small third political force.  The grouping - created under social democrats sponsorship, \u2013 was a union of former Nazis, a virtual successor of Austrian branch of NSDAP (Nazi party), who were banned to join the \"large\" parties at that time.{{sfn|Riekmann|1999|p=84}} The marginalization of the communists, who really had been the backbone of the insignificant Austrian resistance, meant a political defeat of anti-fascists as a whole.{{sfn|Niederacher|2003|p=22}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=19}} The communists failed to enter the governing elite, their past endeavours appeared to be not needed in the contemporary internal Austrian politics; they were however occasionally remembered in communication with western diplomats.{{sfn|Niederacher|2003|p=22}}\n\nParty ideologists realized that the anti-fascist policy did not resonate in Austrian society so they found the way out through the propagation of a conservative view of an Austrian \"national identity\".{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=43}} The \"Book of Austria\" published by the government in 1948 stated that Austria has been a country of simple, peaceful people of high culture, kind Catholics famous not for their wars or politics but for their ancient traditions.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=43}} In place of an internal enemy (Nazism), the new ideology took on the familiar foreign enemy \u2013 Bolshevism.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=44}} The image of \"innocent victimhood\", mostly addressed to the victory states and anticipating the expected near-term withdrawal of the occupying troops, was a good fit for internal policy too. The \"victim theory\" assumed two forms: one for internal and one for foreign use.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|pp=43, 45}} Austrians were still exploiting the slogan of the Moscow Declaration about being \"Hitler's first victim\" in their foreign politics. But inside Austria it was transformed into the newest unifying myth that all the Austrians, without any exception, were all victims.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|pp=44, 45}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=27}} As a political expedient all sections of society were sequentially included to the list of the victims. Former Nazis were included to the myth as \"victims\" who have been deluded and deceived by the foreign tempter. Soon after the Federal Elections of 1949 ({{lang-de|Nationalratswahl in \u00d6sterreich 1949}}), they were officially recognized as \"victims\" of denazification together with those who they themselves victimized.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}} In 1949 Rosa Jochmann, ideologist of social democrats, anti-fascist of the immediate past and former prisoner of [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp|Ravensbr\u00fcck]], presented the new doctrine in this way:\n<blockquote>We all were the victims of fascism. A soldier who has come through the war in its worst form at the front was the victim. The population of the home front, who has been afraid of waiting for air-raid alarm and who has been dreaming of getting rid of bombing horror, was the victim. Those who had to leave their motherland were the victims \u2026 and finally we, unprotected victims of the SS, inmates of prisons and camps, were the victims.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}}</blockquote>\n<blockquote>{{lang| de | Opfer des Faschismus waren wir alle.

Austrian society rejected claims from these groups and portrayed them as attempts to enrich themselves at the expense of ''all'' the \"Nazis' victims\".{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}} The existence of these groups itself was an 'inconvenience': they reminded the great mass of Austrians about their criminal past, hence their erasure from the collective memory.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}} By 1949 installation of memorials to heroes of the resistance was no longer desirable, at least at the provinces. And by the beginning of the 1950s it was identified as being an antagonistic Communist propaganda.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=50}} Some of the previously installed monuments were removed (e.g. common graves in KZ Ebensee and Sankt-Florian{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=53}}), other were redesigned to replace \"provocative\" texts with \"neutral\" ones (e.g. memorial tablet in [[Innsbruck]] at the place of death of Franz Mair (Widerstandsk\u00e4mpfer) that was edited twice \u2013 the first time at the alleged request of German tourists, the second time \u2013 at the request of local Catholics{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=53}}). The ideas of anti-fascists, who were \"undermining the foundations\" while hundreds of Austrians were performing their \"sacred duty\" (even if under the banners of \"German occupiers\"), were finally discredited and condemned.{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=214}}\n\n=== Revanche ===\n\n[[File:BurghardBreitnerMattsee01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Burghard Breitner memorial in [[Mattsee]].

The peak of their construction was in the years 1949\u20131950s.{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=214}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=27}} Mass meetings of veterans became commonplace. The ban of wearing of German military uniform, that had been introduced in 1945, was demonstratively violated everywhere.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=530}} The Provisional Government nervously watched the rise of nationalism. On the one hand, veterans in Nazi uniform provoked the occupational powers.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=530}}; on the other hand, Austrian veterans made common cause with their German counterparts. The border of Austria and the [[Germany|FRG]] was practically open threatening a new, spontaneous Anschluss that was disturbing for the Allies too.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=531}} The government tried to prevent the statements of pro-German activists in the federal media,{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=530}} but did not dare to prosecute their political wing \u2013 the \"Union of Independent\".{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=533}} In the presidential elections of 1951 the former Nazi and the candidate of the \"Union\" Burghard Breitner got more than 15% of votes.<ref name=BB51/>\n\nIn 1955 Austrians managed to solicit the Allies to exclude the provisions of Austrian responsibility for Hitlerite crimes from the [[Austrian State Treaty]]. Earlier Israel has renounced its claims to Austria.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|pp=15\u201316}} After the sovereignty had been recovered and the occupational troops been pulled out, the Austrian conservative rhetoric reached its climax.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}} At last Austrians could openly express their attitude to the results of WWII: according to the \"victim theory\" of that period (1955-1962) the invasion of the victory states in 1945 was not a liberation, but a hostile occupation that superseded Hitlerite one.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}} From this point of view Austria had been a \"victim\" not only of Hitler, but also of the victorious occupiers.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=46}} The first of federal politicians to express this opinion in public was Figl during the celebrations of signing the Austrian State Treaty.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}}\n\nAustrian politicians thought that ultra-right forces would have quickly lost their influence in an independent state, but despite their estimations the veteran movement increased rapidly and took the role of a defender of the society from the \"red threat\"{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=534}} and a new commentator of the state ideology.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=27}} The distinction between the [[Austrian Armed Forces]] and the veteran societies, as it seemed to foreign observers, was smoothed away: employed officers openly wore Hitlerite uniform,{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=536}} the veterans claimed to have a right to carry arms and to create an armed volunteer corps.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=537}} Social democrats, who created the \"Union of Independent\" in 1949, were the first to realize the threat, but conservatives from the [[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]] prevented the attempts to restrain the veterans.{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=540}} Only in 1960 conservatives became concerned with an unpredictable behaviour of people dressed in the Wehrmacht uniform so Austria banned to wear [[Swastika]].{{sfn|Berg|1997|p=540}}\n\n=== Conciliation ===\n\nThe fifteen years of [[Leopold Figl]] and [[Julius Raab]]'s conservative governments maintained a full and uncompromising denial of guilt of Austria and the Austrians in Hitlerite crimes.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=94}} In 1961 the power passed to the socialist government under [[Bruno Kreisky]]. Over the next several years (not later than 1962{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=95}}-1965{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}}), as the first post-war generation entered the social life, the state ideology softened. A process to return the Resistance heroes to the public conscience began. It was followed by a rival campaign of ultra-rightists with the opposite intent.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=57}} A political dialogue within the firmly consolidated and inflexible ruling elite was still not possible: protesting sentiments started to manifest themsleves in in both cultural and scientific spheres.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=120}} In 1963 historians and anti-fascists founded the national archive of the Resistance, in 1964 the federal government approved the construction of the first memorial for the victims of concentration camps in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]].{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} Austrian society interpreted these cautious steps as a challenge for the dominating ultra-right views{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=58}} and resisted such \"attempts to blacken the past\". During the shooting of a musical film [[The Sound of Music]], the plot of which unfolds just the times of the Anschluss and immediately after, the Authorities of [[Salzburg]] forbade the producers to decorate the streets of the city with Nazi symbols insisting that \"there had never been Nazis in Salzburg\".{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=104}} They retreated only after the producers threatened to use the true newsreels of the Nazi processions in Salzburg.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=104}} The film had a worldwide success, but failed in Austria.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=102}}\n\nThe death of a 67-year old anti-fascist [[Ernst Kirchweger]], beaten to death on March 31, 1965 during a demonstration against Nazi professor [[Taras Borodajkewycz]] catalysed change.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}}{{sfn|Art|2005|p=111}} The subsequent demonstrations of protest were unexpectedly supported by all the federal-level politicians{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} The elite no longer had any need for the politics of the ultra-right. Moreover, being afraid of a spontaneous movement to an authoritarian dictatorship, the elite preferred to distance themselves from the ultra-right.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} In the same year the first memorial for anti-fascists constructed by the federal powers was opened in [[Hofburg]].{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=56}} By the beginning of the 1970s the \"victim theory\" had mutated again. Anti-fascists were now returned to the official pantheon, but honouring of the Wehrmacht soldiers was still predominant.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=57}} Open anti-Semitism surrendered its positions slowly: according to the 1969 poll the genocide of Jews has been firmly approved by 55% of [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] electorate, 30% of [[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]] electorate and 18% of [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SP\u00d6]] electorate (the question was \"Do you agree that during 1938-1945 the Jews got their come-uppance?\"; the results of the \"firmly agree\" answer are given here{{sfn|Pelinka|1989|p=255}}); by 1985 these proportions decreased by 45%, 25% and 16% respectively.{{sfn|Pelinka|1989|p=255}} All the political parties viewed the \"everyday life\" during the Nazi era with considerable tolerance, and they subsequently shaped it, intentionally or not, into legitimacy and even prestige.{{sfn|Pelinka|1989|p=255}}\n\nThe consensus reached in the 1960s was maintained into the following decade. The [[Protests of 1968]] in Vienna, jokingly called a \"tamed revolution\" ({{lang-de|Eine Zahme Revolution}}), had little consequences.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}} The post-war generation of Austrians, as compared to Germans of the same age, has appeared to be passive and has not tried to review the past in the same active manner; this generation did not direct politicians, but rather followed them.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=121}} The ruling social democrats, with the knowledge of Kreisky, continued both secret and obvious cooperation with former Nazis.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}} Episodic protests against Nazi officials gave no results. In 1970 a minister of Kreisky's government,  a former Untersturmf\u00fchrer of the SS Johann \u00d6llinger, was exposed by the West German press and had to resign.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=114}} Instead Kreisky (a Jew himself, who escaped to Sweden in 1938{{sfn|Art|2005|p=113}}{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=25}}) appointed another former Nazi in his stead [[Oskar Weihs]].{{sfn|Art|2005|p=114}} In 1975 the case of a political ally of Kreisky, [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] president [[Friedrich Peter]], who had been an officer in the [[1 SS Infantry Brigade]] during WWII, was a turning point.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=59}} Austrian politicians solidly supported Peter and condemned [[Simon Wiesenthal]] who had exposed him. According to the Opinion Polls this viewpoint was supported by 59% of Austrians.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=115}} Kreisky blamed Wiesenthal for aiding and abetting [[Gestapo]] and called Austrians to reconciliation \u2013 all of them, as the Chancellor said, were the Nazis' victims.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=114}} The limit of criticism was discovered.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=59}}\n\n== Practical implementation ==\n\n=== End of denazification ===\nDenazification in Austria in comparison with other counties was soft and smooth: there was nothing like the internal ideological conflict, leading to the civil war in [[Greece]], or the political repressions experienced in Eastern Europe and [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=145}} Researchers pick out 3 or 4 stages of denazification:\n* April \u2013 May 1945: the occupying powers took sole charge of the [[lustration]] and criminal prosecution of former Nazis;\n* May 1945 \u2013 February 1946: Austrian \"people's courts\" ({{lang-de|Volksgericht}}) worked simultaneously with the above;\n* February 1946 \u2013 May 1948: Austrian powers carried out denazification alone.{{sfn|Deak|2006|pp=138\u2013139}}\nDuring the whole period \"people's courts\" tried 137 thousand cases and passed 43 capital sentences.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=24}}\n\nThe American occupiers conducted denazification firmly and consistently:{{sfn|Deak|2006|pp=130\u2013131, 139}} the bigger part of 18 thousand prosecuted Nazis was convicted in their sector.{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=139}} During the whole period of the occupation the Soviet powers arrested and prosecuted approximately 2000 Austrians, 1000 of them were removed to the USSR for trial and penal consequences, about 200 were executed (for \"espionage\", as a rule). Many more Nazis were detained by the Soviet powers and then handed to Austrian authorities.{{sfn|Bekes|2015|pp=22-23}} In the beginning, the Soviet powers were prepared to \"whitewash\" the \"less tainted\" Nazis with the hope that they would help to reinforce the Austrian communist party resources.{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=139}} But after the latter was defeated at the November elections in 1945, the Soviet powers abandoned the idea to \"export the revolution\" to Austria and ceased to rely on the Austrian communist party.{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=139}} The British sector of occupation, [[Carinthia]], was the one with the largest part of Nazis within the population. During the elections of 1949 rehabilitated Nazis made 18,8 % of Carinthia electorate; this compared with 9.9% in Vienna and 8.7% in [[Lower Austria]] and [[Burgenland]].{{sfn|Pelinka|1989|p=251}} Tensions between the bodies that prosecuted Hitlerites, and economic powers, that actively recruited former Nazi industrial and commercial managers, were never ending in the British sector.{{sfn|Knight|2007|pp=586\u2013587}} Mass lustration and post-war economic restoration appeared to be incompatible: there was not enough spotless people to fill all the urgent vacancies.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=93}}{{sfn|Knight|2007|pp=586\u2013587}} One third of judges in the \"people's courts\" were former Nazis;{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=140}} 80%, according to the Soviet information, of the [[gendarmerie]] of the British sector were former Nazis.{{sfn|Bekes|2015|pp=309\u2013310}} Austrian powers regularly reported about \"full denazification\" of one or another department, but in reality the \"cleaned out\" Nazis just were transferred from one position to another.{{sfn|Bekes|2015|pp=309\u2013310}} Political parties, including the Communists, actively accepted Nazis under the their patronage and protected them from the occupational powers and rival parties using the principle \"do not touch ours or we will attack yours\".{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|p=97}}\n\nAfter the [[Cold War]] started, the Austrian government used the dissension between the former Allies to promote a reconsideration of the value of denazification.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=93}} In May 1948 it was discontinued and a 9-year \"period of amnesties\" of former Nazis started.{{sfn|Deak|2006|p=139}} The victory states preferred civil peace and stability to righting a wrong and secretly agreed with the Austrian viewpoint.{{sfn|Deak|2006|pp=145\u2013146}}{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=93}} In 1955 \"people's courts\" were dismissed, Nazis' cases were passed to [[General jurisdiction|courts of general jurisdiction]], that in 1960 become notorious for verdicts of not guilty in resonant cases.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=24}} In mid-70s the prosecution of Nazis was officially stopped.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=24}}\n\n=== Denial of financial restitution ===\n\nIn the second half of 1945 about 4500 surviving Jews returned to Vienna.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=105}} Renner and his government, using the \"victim theory\" as a cover, refused to return them their property seized during the Nazi regime. All the responsibility to help former camp inmates was laid on to the [[Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien|Vienna Israelite Community]] and the\"[[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]]\".{{sfn|Bukey|2000|p=231}}{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=105}} According to the Financial Aid Law of July 17, 1945 Austria only supported \"active\" (political) prisoners, but not \"passive\" victims of ethnic cleansing.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=104}} This support was limited to a modest allowance, there was no question of compensations for losses. Politicians justified this rejection of restitution both with ideological clich\u00e9s and the real weakness of the new state that was established from the ruins of the defeated Reich.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}} According to Figl all that had  happened in Austria was similar to a natural disaster. Austria was not capable of either recouping the losses, or even easing the miseries of people who had suffered during those years.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=106}}\n\nUntil the end of 1990s public policy of the Second Republic in terms of restitution was defined by the \"victim theory\". Procrastination of legislative decisions on the matter and bureaucracy during their administration became an unwritten practical rule. The first to formulate it was the Minister of Internal Affairs [[Oscar Helmer]] (one of few politicians who have admitted the responsibility of Austrians) in 1945: \"Ich bin daf\u00fcr, die Sache in die L\u00e4nge zu ziehen\" (\"I think that this question should be dragged out\").<ref>Helmer announced this on a closed session of the provisional government. For the first time these words were published by Robert Nite in 1988. His work provoked a new round of political discussion about Austrian evasion of responsibility.{{harvnb|Art|2005|p=108}}{{harvnb|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=29}}</ref> All the legislative decisions concerning restitution were passed only under pressure from the allied occupational powers and later \u2013 after 1955 \u2013 by the US and Jewish social organizations.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=308}} Austrian legislation has developed in fits and starts from one foreign policy crisis to another.{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=122}} In the beginning Austrians resisted and tried to develop another consensual decision, haggled for mutual concessions,{{refn|1=For instance, in 1952 Austria made the recognition of Israel conditional on withdrawal of Israel's material charges to Austria{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=100}}}} and then silently sabotaged the decision.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=311}} Successful completion of legislative initiatives to recognise rights of one or another group was determined by the political weight of its activists:{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|pp=35, 36\u201337}} for half a century the priority was to get pensions and allowances for Wehrmacht veterans. Jews and Gypsies got formal recognition in 1949,{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=34}} [[Doctors' trial|medical crimes]] victims \u2013 only in 1995, homosexuals and asexuals \u2013 in 2005.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=35}}\n\nAs a result, Austrian law that regulated restitution to victims turned out to be a complicated and controversial \"patchwork quilt\" made of  a multitude of acts on separate cases.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=308}} The law of 1947 about social assistance to the victims of repressions had been corrected 30 times during 50 years.{{sfn|Bailer|1997|p=107}} For some incidental points like the restitution of confiscated property Austrians formed a fair and fully-fledged legal basis as early as 1947. The other ones, like the lost rights of rented apartments,{{refn|1=During 1938\u20131939 no less than 59 thousand apartments occupied by Jews were \"aryanised\" in Vienna alone. The restitution of the lost rights to rent as such was rejected by all the generations of Austrian politicians under the pretext that it should have required eviction of tens of thousands of new tenants therefore leading to mass disorders. Only in 2000 Austria agreed to refund the lost rights to rent with 7000 USD for every lost apartment{{sfn|Bailer|2011|pp=313-315}}}} were left without any decision.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=309}} All these laws referred not to [[public law]], but to [[Civil law (area)|private civil law]].{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=308}} Plaintiffs were obliged to prove their rights in Austrian civil courts that had an adverse policy (except a short period in the end of the 1940s).{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=308}}{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=99}} Even when the federal government had a fair mind to settle another dispute,{{refn|1=E.g. the campaign of the Austrian Ministry of Culture to return several thousand pieces of art (1966\u20131972){{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=319}}}} the state apparatus had no time to try all the claims.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=311}} Probably neither politicians nor ordinary officials realised the real scale of Hitler's repressions.{{sfn|Bailer|2011|p=311}}\n\n=== Rewriting of history ===\n\nFor the Second Republic to survive it was necessary for the Austrians to establish their own national identity, and this needed to be created.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}}{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|pp=94\u201395}} As far back as the 1940s, a new, particular history of Austria had been urgently composed to satisfy this purpose: it introduced into existence a unique Austrian nation that differed from the German one.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}} The heroes' pantheon of this history was made up of people that had no connection with Germany within the 20th century, i.e. [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria|Leopold the Glorious]] or [[Andreas Hofer]].{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=95}} In 1946 a celebration of the 950-year anniversary of the ancient [[name of Austria]] ({{lang-de|Ostarrichi}}) was right on the button.

The consensual opinion of Austrian academics was that a common language could not be the determining factor.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=108}}\n\nDuring the first post-war decades historical perspectives within Austria, like the society as a whole, was separated into two-party columns \u2013 conservative and social-democratic,{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=97-98}} who however together wrote the consensual (\"coalitionist\", {{lang-de|Koalitionsgeschichtsschreibung}}) history under administration of the party supervisors.{{sfn|Ritter|1992|p=113}} Probably there was no alternative during those years: simply no humanitarian or ideological schools existed outside of the party camps.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|p=98}} Both the schools fabricated the [[contemporary history]] in their own way, supporting the all-nation \"victim\" myth.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=95, 98}} Conservative historians hid [[Leopold Kunschak]]'s anti-Semitism, social democrats were silent about Renner's sycophancy before Stalin and Hitler.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=95, 98}} The competing groups never tried to expose each other, they continued to mutually respect the party legends and taboos for 3 decades.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=99}} [[Anton Pelinka]] thought that denying and silencing the historical reality allowed for the first time in history, a consolidation of society and healing of the wounds of the past.{{sfn|Pelinka|1997|pp=99}}\n\nIn the 1970s historians, following the political order, focused on investigation of the interwar period; the Nazi regime being interpreted as absolution from sins of the First Republic and still within the boundaries of the \"victim theory\".{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=59}} Authors of the standard \"History of Austria\" (1977) Gorlich and Romanik stated that WWII belonged to world history, it was not an Austrian war because Austria as a state did not participate in it.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=48}} Along with this, Austrian patriots knew that the path to Austrian national revival laid through Hitler's defeat.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=48}} Austria's own history was considered separate to a common one with Germany;{{sfn|Ritter|1992|p=113}} by 1980 the belief that a special, \"non-German\" national identity of Austrians had long existed, became firmly established.{{sfn|Ritter|1992|p=113}} The Austrian lineage of [[Odilo Globocnik]], [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], [[Adolf Eichmann]] and other Nazi criminals was suppressed: the historians called them German occupiers.{{sfn|Uhl|2006|p=45}} The only existing (as of 2007) [[monograph]] about denazification in Austria (Dieter Stiefel, 1981) described it as an unfounded and incompetent intervention of the victors into home affairs.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=572}} Left-wing historians, in their turn, criticised the Allies for supposed suppression of a spontaneous anti-fascist movement, which had no appreciable influence in reality.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=572}}\n\n=== School syllabi ===\n\nOne of the methods to consolidate the ideology became school syllabi,{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=109}} where the \"victim\" myth was closely interwoven with the myth about a special, non-German identity of Austrians.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|pp=111}} The highest goal of the Austrian school system became a patriotic education in a spirit of national union that required forgetting the immediate past and forgiving the past sins of all compatriots.\n\nTextbooks presented the Anschluss as an act of German aggression against innocent \"victims\" and methodically shifted blame to other countries, who gave Austria up during the hard times.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}} The first textbooks blamed the western countries for [[Appeasement#The conduct of appeasement, 1937\u201339|appeasement of Hitler]].{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}} In the 1960s the USSR temporarily became the main villain whom ''Austrians'' fought against in a ''just'' war.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=141}} Until the 1970s the existence of Austrian support for the Anschluss as well as Austrian Nazism was denied: according to the textbooks Austrian society was a solid mass, of which every member equally was a \"victim\" of foreign forces.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}}{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|pp=201, 202}} Authors of a 1955 school reading book ignored the concept of Anschluss ('union'): Austria was literally presented as a victim of German ''military'' aggression, just like Poland or France.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=139}} Books of 1950s and 1960s mentioned the Holocaust rarely and in a reduced form of a minor episode.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=202}} The topic of a traditional Austrian anti-Semitism and its role in the events of 1938-1945 were never discussed; from the authors' point of view the persecution of Jews had been an exclusive consequence of Hitler's personal animosity.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=202}} In the 1960s a typical clich\u00e9 of Austrian school programmes was an indispensable comparison of the Holocaust and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] or sometimes [[Katyn massacre]].

They mentioned the existence of concentration camps, but their description was reduced to just a ''political'' prosecution of a ''political'' enemies of Hitler;{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=204}} the books considered the camps as a place where consolidation of the national elite has happened, a personnel department of the Second Republic in its own way.{{sfn|Korostelina|2013|p=141}} The Holocaust was mentioned but was never classified as [[genocide]];  there were no absolute figures of exterminated people: Austrian school invented the \"Holocaust without Jews\".{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=205}} Only in 1990s authors of textbook admitted the real scale of the crimes, but kept the comparison of the Holocaust with Hiroshima. The two catastrophes still co-existed and were continuously compared, and Austrians who committed evil acts were still presented as passive executors of foreign will.{{sfn|Utgaard|1999|p=209}}\n\n== Historical role ==\n\nAll the countries that suffered under Nazi power tried more or less to forget their own past after the war.{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=208}} Ones that had a resistance movement glorified it, forgetting about [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|collaborationism]]. Others, like Austria, preferred to consider themselves victims of the foreign aggression,{{sfn|Uhl|2013|p=208}}{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}} although Austria, itself, did have a [[Austrian Resistance|resistance movement]] (The Resistance in Austria, 1938\u20131945 Radom\u00edr Luza, University of Minnesota Press, 1984). According to the opinion of American politologist David Art, the Austrian \"white lies\" about being a \"victim\" served four important purposes:\n\n* For the first time in modern history the two rival political forces \u2013 conservatives and social democrats \u2013 united around this issue. The common rhetoric of being a \"victim\" allowed the country to forget the [[Austrian Civil War|Civil War]] of the 1930s; mutual silence about the sins of the past helped to establish trust relationships between the two parties. The \"big coalition\" of conservatives, social democrats, church and trade unions, formed in the 1940s ruled the country for almost half a century;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}}\n* The recognition of all Austrians as \"victims\" allowed the integratione of the former Nazis (1/6 of all adults in the country{{sfn|Bekes|2015|p=308}}) into social and political life;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=109}}\n* Distancing from the German \"occupiers\" was essential to build Austrian national identity.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}} Austrians of 1920s-1930s considered themselves Germans and being a part of the Reich for 8 years just confirmed their beliefs.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}} Politicians of 1940s understood that the so called \"Austrian nation\" never existed, but they needed an ideology to form a core of national identity \u2013 the \"victim theory\" was the one to solve the problem;{{sfn|Art|2005|p=107}}\n* The \"victim theory\" allowed the postponmento and delay of restitution for half a century.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=108}} Industrial assets that had been taken from Jews during Hitler times and nationalized by the Second Republic, became the part of an economical foundation of postwar Austria.{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}}\n\n== Dismantling of the myth ==\n\n=== Waldheim affair ===\n\nIn 1985 the \u00d6VP political party nominated the former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UNSG]] [[Kurt Waldheim]] for the federal president election.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=115}} During WWII Waldheim [[Kurt Waldheim#Military service in World War II|served as an intelligence officer]] in the Wehrmacht within the occupied territories of the USSR, Greece and Yugoslavia. West German and later Austrian and American journalists and the [[World Jewish Congress|WJC]] accused Waldheim of being a member of Nazi organizations and of passive co-operation in punitive actions in the Balkans.{{sfn|Art|2005|pp=118, 132}} Waldheim denied all the accusations and insisted that the campaign of defamation has been directed not towards him in person, but towards all his generation.{{sfn|Art|2005|pp=118, 121}} The president of WJC [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.|Edgar Bronfman]] acknowledged this: \"The issue is not Kurt Waldheim. He is a mirror of Austria. His lies are of secondary importance. The real issue is that Austria has lied for decades about its own involvement in the atrocities Mr. Waldheim was involved in: deportations, reprisal murders, and others too painful to think about\".{{sfn|Art|2005|p=118}} The Waldheim affair captivated the country, an unprecedented discussion about the military past developed in the press.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=118}} At the beginning of it the conservatives, who absolutely dominated in Austrian media, {{sfn|Art|2005|p=121}} formulated a new \"victim theory\" that was the first in history to apply to the patriotism of Austrians.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=120}} From the right-wing's point of view both Austria and Waldheim personally became victims of the campaign of defamation by the world Jewry, therefore support for Waldheim should be a duty for all patriots.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=120}} The questions about Hitlerite past were interpreted as an attack against patriotic feelings of Austrians; the right-wingers insisted that during WWII Austrians behaved respectably, so digging the past up was unneeded and harmful.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=120}}\n\nThe electoral campaign of Waldheim was built on a call to Austrian national feelings. Waldheim won the elections in the second round of voting, but he was not able to perform his main responsibility as the president of Austria \u2013 diplomatic representation.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=117}} The USA and later European countries boycotted Waldheim.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=117}} Austria got a reputation of a promoter of Nazism and a foe to Israel. European organisations continuously criticised the country for its support of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].{{sfn|Pick|2000|pp=197\u2013199}} In order to rehabilitate the president, the Austrian government founded an independent commission of historians. In February 1988 they confirmed accusations against Waldheim: while not being the direct executor or the organizer of war crimes, it was impossible for him not to know about them.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=117}} The direct result of the Waldheim affair in home policy was the defeat of the social democrats and the factual break-up of the postwar two-party system.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=119}} The[[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Green Party]] appeared on the political scene and the radical right-wing [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] under [[J\u00f6rg Haider]] grew in strength. The system of mutual taboos collapsed and politicians were no more obliged to keep silence about rivals' affairs.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=119}}\n\n=== Left-wing opposition ===\n\n[[File:Wien - Innere Stadt - Mahnmal gegen Krieg und Faschismus - Stra\u00dfen waschender Jude.jpg|thumb|right|240px|\"A Jew forced to clean the street\" \u2013 a part of the memorial against wars and fascism at Albertinaplatz, 1988.]]\n\nDomestic opposition to the ideology represented by Waldheim arose from the circles of liberal-left intellectuals, far from the political power of the influential mass media.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=130}} During the latter decades of the 20th century the left movement mobilised. In 1992 they called out more than 300 thousand people to demonstrate against J\u00f6rg Haider.{{sfn|Art|2005|p=132}} Scandals around Waldheim and Haider in a universities ended with the victory of the liberal-left school and a full revision of the former ideological guidelines.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=574}} Authors of the generation of 1990s investigated the evolution of old prejudices and stereotypes (first of all anti-Semitism), disputed the role of the Resistance in the history of the country and analysed immoral, in their opinion, evasion by Austrian politicians by not admitting the responsibility of the nation.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=574}} Attention of the researchers switched from the acts  of individual Austrian politicians to previous campaigns against Gypsy and homosexuals.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=29}} Critics of this school (Gabriele Matzner-Holzer, Rudolf Burger and others) noticed that the left-wing authors tended to judge people of the past, using moral norms of the end of the 20th century, and have not tried to clearly ascertain if it ever was really possible to repent in such a criminal society ({{lang-de|Tatergesellschaft}}) steeped in Nazism as the Austria of the 1940s.{{sfn|Knight|2007|p=575}}\n\nIn the 1980s, the topic of Nazi crimes started appearing regularly on television.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=30}} Victims of Nazism who survived to the 1980s and who were previously afraid of speaking out, started to regularly appear on the screen both as witnesses of the past and as heroes of documentaries.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=30}} In 1988 the memorial against wars and fascism ({{lang-de|Mahnmal gegen Krieg und Faschismus}}) was opened under the walls of \"[[Albertina]]\"; in 1995 a public exhibition about the Wehrmacht ({{lang-de|Wehrmachtsaufstellung}}) became the event of the year and started a discussion of the previously untouchable topic of the almost half a million Austrians who fought on Hitler's side.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=30}} A change of social sentiment resulted from the Austrian media turnaround: admission of the criminal past replaced the previous denial.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=30}}{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=89}} At the beginning of the 1990s collective responsibility was admitted by only a small circle of intellectuals, politicians and left-wing youth; by the mid-2000s the majority of Austrians had gradually joined them.{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=89}}\n\n=== Acknowledgement of liability ===\n\nThe abandonment of the \"victim theory\" by the Austrian ''state'' and gradual admittance of the responsibility began in 1988.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=36}} Austria contributed to an existing fund of for Nazi victims, established a new fund and for the first time in history made payments for benefit of emigrants, and widened the scope of legally recognised victims (in particular Gypsy and [[Carinthian Slovenes]]).{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=36}} These actions of the state were prompted both by changes in Austrian society and by the unparalleled crisis in foreign politics.{{sfn|Embacher|Ecker|2010|p=36}} During the whole Waldheim's term of office (1986\u20131992) the international situation of Austria deteriorated; governments of the US and Israel joined the pressure made by the [[Jewish diasporas]] as they did not wanted to admit the Nazi country, which had supported [[Yasser Arafat]] and [[Muammar Gaddafi]], to the world political stage.{{sfn|Pick|2000|pp=197\u2013199}}\n\nAs early as 1987 [[Hugo Portisch]], advisor of the [[Chancellor of Austria|federal chancellor]] [[Franz Vranitzky]], recommended the government to immediately and unconditionally admit the responsibility of Austria and to apologize to the world Jewry; Vranitzky concurred this opinion, but had no courage to act.{{sfn|Pick|2000|pp=197\u2013199}} Only in July 1991, one year before the end of Waldheim's term, when the political influence of Vranitzky and social democrats has noticeably increased,{{sfn|Berger|2012|p=112}} the chancellor made a public apology on behalf of the nation and admitted its responsibility (but not the guilt) for the crimes of the past.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=197}}{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}} But neither Americans nor Israelis were impressed by this cautious confession made inside the Austrian Parliament.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=200}} Things started to move only after Vranitzky officially visited Israel in 1993;{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=200}} during his visit he admitted the responsibility not solely of the nation, but also the ''state'' but with a condition that the concept of a collective guilt was not applicable to Austrians{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}}. A year later public apologies were made by the new conservative president [[Thomas Klestil]].{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=88}}\n\nThe \"victim theory\" had now been completely abandoned,{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=89}} at least at the level of the highest organs of government. Nobody has doubted the will of Vranitzky and Klestil, but sceptics doubted if the Austrian nation was ready to share their position.{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=200}} Conservative politicians had no desire to support this new ideology{{sfn|Pick|2000|p=200}} and the influence of FP\u00d6 party swiftly increased. The unification of the left and right happened only in 2000 during another crisis in foreign politics caused by the FP\u00d6's electoral victory.{{sfn|Berger|2012|pp=116}} This time Austria was not only under the pressure from the US and Jewish organisations but also the European Union.{{sfn|Berger|2012|pp=117\u2013118}} Unexpectedly, Austria's integration in the EU appeared to be more vulnerable than in the 1980s.{{sfn|Berger|2012|pp=117\u2013118}} Politicians had to make concessions once again: under the insistence of Klestil the leaders of the parliamentary parties signed another declaration on the Austrian responsibility and approved a new roadmap towards satisfying the claims of victims of National Socialism.{{sfn|Berger|2012|pp=116}} The work of the Austrian Historical Commission ({{lang-de|\u00d6sterreichische Historikerkommission}}) resulted in admission of the economical \"aryanisation\" of 1938\u20131941 as a part of the [[Holocaust]] (that was equal to unconditional consent for restitution);{{sfn|Karn|2015|p=93}} Under the [[Washington Agreement (2001)|Washington Agreement]] signed with Austrian government and industry, Austria admitted its debts towards Jews ($480 mln) and [[Ostarbeiters]] ($420 mln).{{sfn|Karn|2015|pp=100\u2013101}} For the first time in Austrian history, this programme of restitution was fulfilled within the shortest possible time.{{sfn|Berger|2012|pp=116}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book|last1=Poltavsky|first1=M.

It was her twelfth novel, and was initially serialized in 1920 in four parts, in the magazine ''[[Pictorial Review]]''. Later that year, it was released as a book by [[D. Appleton & Company]]. It won the [[1921 Pulitzer Prize|1921 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]], making Wharton the first woman to win the prize.<ref>Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''.

Wharton wrote the book in her 50s, after she had established herself as a strong author, with publishers clamoring for her work.\n\n[[File:The Age of Innocence - Reynolds.jpg|thumbnail|right|''[[The Age of Innocence (painting)|The Age of Innocence]]'', a character study by the Englishman [[Joshua Reynolds]] completed in either 1785 or 1788, is believed to have been the inspiration for the title of Wharton's novel.]]\n\n== Background ==\n''The Age of Innocence'', which was set in the time of Wharton's childhood, was a softer and gentler work than ''[[The House of Mirth]]'', which Wharton had published in 1905. In her autobiography, Wharton wrote of ''The Age of Innocence'' that it had allowed her to find \"a momentary escape in going back to my childish memories of a long-vanished America... it was growing more and more evident that the world I had grown up in and been formed by had been destroyed in 1914.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Backward Glance: An Autobiography |last=Wharton |first=Edith |publisher=The Curtis Publishing Co. |year=1933 |isbn=|location=New York |pages=56}}</ref> Scholars and readers alike agree that ''The Age of Innocence'' is fundamentally a story which struggles to reconcile the old with the new.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Edith Wharton's Old New York Society |last=Zihala |first=Maryann |publisher=University Press of America |year=2002 |isbn= |location=New York |pages=33}}</ref>\n\nWharton was raised in the old world of rigid and proper New York society which features in the story. She had spent her middle years, including the whole of [[World War I]], in Europe, where the devastation of a new kind of mechanized warfare was felt most deeply. As explained by Millicent Bell in the Cambridge companion to Wharton, \"''The Age of Innocence'' was composed and first read in the aftermath of [[Theodore Roosevelt|[Theodore] Roosevelt]]'s death and in the immediate wake of World War I. We frame the ending remembering the multiple losses... not only the loss of Roosevelt but the destruction of the prewar world and all that Wharton valued in it.\"<ref name=\"BellCambridge\">{{Cite book |title=Cambridge Companion to Wharton |last=Bell |first=Millicent |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn= |location=Cambridge |pages=20}}</ref>\n\n''The Age of Innocence'' centers on an upper-class couple's impending marriage, and the introduction of the bride's cousin, plagued by scandal, whose presence threatens their happiness. Though the novel questions the assumptions and morals of 1870s New York society, it never develops into an outright condemnation of the institution. The novel is noted for Wharton's attention to detail and its accurate portrayal of how the 19th-century East Coast [[American upper class]] lived, as well as for the social tragedy of its plot. Wharton was 58 years old at publication; she had lived in that world and had seen it change dramatically by the end of World War I.\n\nThe title is an ironic comment on the polished outward manners of New York society when compared to its inward machinations. It is believed to have been drawn from the popular painting ''A Little Girl'' by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]] that later became known as ''The Age of Innocence'' and was widely reproduced as the commercial face of childhood in the later half of the 18th century.<ref>[[Martin Postle|Postle, Martin]].

Yet he finds reason to doubt his choice of bride after the appearance of Countess Ellen Olenska, May's exotic and beautiful 30-year-old cousin. Olenska strikes Archer as the opposite of the innocent and ignorant May Welland. Ellen has returned to New York from Europe after scandalously separating herself (per rumor) from a disastrous marriage to a Polish count. At first, Ellen's arrival and its potential taint on the reputation of his bride-to-be's family disturbs Newland, but he becomes intrigued by the worldly Ellen, who brazenly flouts New York society's fastidious rules. As Newland's admiration for the countess grows, so do his doubts about marrying May, a perfect product of Old New York society; his match with May no longer seems the ideal fate he had imagined.\n\nEllen's decision to divorce Count Olenski causes a social crisis for the other members of her family, who are terrified of scandal and disgrace. Living apart can be tolerated, but divorce is unacceptable. To save the Welland family's reputation, a law partner of Newland asks him to dissuade Countess Olenska from going through with the divorce. He succeeds, but in the process comes to care for her. Afraid of falling in love with Ellen, Newland begs May to accelerate their wedding date, but she refuses.\n\nNewland tells Ellen he loves her; Ellen corresponds, but is horrified that their love will aggrieve May. She agrees to remain in America, separated but still married to Count Olenski, only if they do not sexually consummate their love. Newland receives May's telegram agreeing to wed sooner.\n\nNewland and May marry. He tries unsuccessfully to forget Ellen. His society marriage is mediocre, and the social life he once found absorbing has become empty and joyless. Though Ellen lives in Washington and has remained distant, he is unable to cease loving her. Their paths cross while he and May are in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. Newland discovers that Count Olenski wishes Ellen to return to him, but she has refused, although her family wants her to reconcile with her husband and return to Europe. Frustrated by her independence, the family has cut off her money, as the count had already done.\n\nNewland desperately seeks a way to leave May and be with Ellen, obsessed with how to finally possess her. Despairing of ever making Ellen his wife, he urges her to become his mistress. Then Ellen is recalled to New York City to care for her sick grandmother, who accepts her decision to remain separated and agrees to reinstate her allowance.\n\nBack in New York and under renewed pressure from Newland, Ellen relents and agrees to consummate their relationship. However, Newland then discovers that Ellen has decided to return to Europe. Newland makes up his mind to abandon May and follow Ellen to Europe when May announces that she and Newland are throwing a farewell party for Ellen. That night, after the party, Newland resolves to tell May he is leaving her for Ellen. She interrupts him to tell him that she learned that morning that she is pregnant; she reveals that she had told Ellen of her pregnancy two weeks earlier, despite not being sure of it at the time. The implication is that May did so because she suspected the affair and that this is Ellen's reason for returning to Europe. Hopelessly trapped, Newland decides to remain with May and not to follow Ellen, surrendering his love for the sake of his child.\n\nTwenty-six years later, after May's death, Newland and his eldest son are in Paris. The son, learning that his mother's cousin lives there, has arranged to visit Ellen in her Paris apartment. Newland is stunned at the prospect of seeing Ellen again. On arriving outside the apartment building, Newland sends up his son alone to meet Ellen, while he waits outside, watching the balcony of her apartment. Newland considers going up, but in the end decides not to; he walks back to his hotel without seeing her. Newland's final words about the love affair were \"It's more real to me here than if I went up.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Age Of Innocence|last=Wharton|first=Edith|publisher=Black & White Classics|year=2015|isbn=9781508475576|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Major characters==\n\n=== Newland Archer ===\nThe story's protagonist is a young, popular, and successful lawyer living with his mother and sister in an elegant New York City house. Since childhood, his life has been shaped by the customs and expectations of upper-class New York City society. His engagement to May Welland is one in a string of accomplishments. At the story's start, he is proud and content to dream about a traditional marriage in which he will be the husband-teacher and she the wife-student. His life changes when he meets Countess Ellen Olenska. Through his relationship with her\u2014first friendship, then love\u2014he begins questioning the values on which he was raised. He sees the sexual inequality of New York society and the shallowness of its customs, and struggles to balance social commitment to May with love for Ellen. He cannot find a place for their love in the intricate, judgmental web of New York society. Throughout the story's progress, he transgresses the boundaries of acceptable behavior for love of Ellen: first following her to Skuytercliff, then Boston, and finally deciding to follow her to Europe (though he later changes his mind). In the end, though, Newland Archer finds that the only place for their love is in his memories. Some scholars see Wharton most projected onto Newland's character, rather than Ellen Olenska.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Critical Reception of Edith Wharton|last=Killoran|first=Hellen|publisher=Camden House|year=2001|isbn=|location=Rochester|pages=90}}</ref>\n\n=== May Welland ===\nNewland Archer's fianc\u00e9e, then wife. Raised to be a perfect wife and mother, she follows and perfectly obeys all of society's customs. Mostly, she is the shallow, uninterested and uninteresting young woman that New York society requires. When they are in St. Augustine, though, May gives Newland a rare glimpse of the maturity and compassion he had previously ignored. She offers to release him from their engagement so he can marry the woman he truly loves, thinking he wants to be with Mrs. Rushworth, a married woman with whom he had recently ended a love affair. When he assures May that he loves only her, May appears to trust him, at least at first. Yet after their marriage, she suspects that Newland is Ellen's lover. Nonetheless, May pretends to be happy before society, maintaining the illusion that she and he have the perfect marriage expected of them. Her unhappiness activates her manipulative nature, and Newland does not see it until too late. To drive Ellen away from him, May tells Ellen of her pregnancy before she is certain of it. Yet there still is compassion in May, even in their mediocre marriage's long years after Ellen's leaving. After May's death, Newland Archer learns she had always known of his continued love for Ellen; as May lay dying, she told their son Dallas that the children could always trust their father, Newland, because he surrendered the thing most meaningful to him out of loyalty to their marriage. May is a picture of Innocence.\n\n=== Ellen Olenska ===\nMay's cousin and Mrs. Manson Mingott's granddaughter. She became a countess by marrying Polish Count Olenski, a European nobleman. Her husband was allegedly cruel and abusive, stole Ellen's fortune and had affairs with other women. When the story begins, Ellen has fled her unhappy marriage, lived in Venice with her husband's secretary, and has returned to her family in New York City. She is a free spirit who helps Newland Archer see beyond narrow New York society. She treats her maid, Nastasia, as an equal, offering the servant her own cape before sending her out on an errand. She attends parties with disreputable people such as Julius Beaufort and Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, and she invites Newland, the fianc\u00e9 of her cousin May, to visit her. Ellen suffers as much as Newland from their impossible love, but she is willing to live in emotional limbo so long as they can love each other at a distance. Ellen's love for Newland drives her important decisions: dropping divorce from Count Olenski, remaining in America, and offering Newland choice of sexual consummation only once, and then disappearing from his life. Her conscience and responsibility to family complicate her love for Newland. When she learns of May's pregnancy, Ellen immediately decides to leave America, refusing Newland's attempt to follow her to Europe, and so allow cousin May to start her family with her husband Newland. The reception of Ellen's character has changed over time. From a willful temptress to a fabulously independent woman, far ahead of her time, one thing is for certain: \u201cEllen has only to walk alone across a drawing room to offend its definitions.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Wharton|last=Bell|first=Millicent|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=32}}</ref>\n\n=== Mrs. Manson Mingott ===\nThe matriarch of the powerful Mingott family, and grandmother to Ellen and May. She was born Catherine Spicer, to an inconsequential family. Widowed at 28, she has ensured her family's social position through her own shrewdness and force of character. She controls her family: at Newland's request, she has May and Mrs. Welland agree to an earlier wedding date. She controls the money\u2014withholding Ellen's living allowance (when the family is angry with Ellen), and having niece Regina Beaufort ask for money when in financial trouble. Mrs. Mingott is a maverick in the polite world of New York society, at times pushing the boundaries of acceptable behavior, such as receiving guests in her house's ground floor, though society associates that practice with women of questionable morals. Her welcoming Ellen is viewed skeptically, and she insists the rest of the family support Ellen. Mrs. Mingott was inspired by Edith Wharton's own portly great-great-aunt, Mary Mason Jones, who is said to have given rise to the phrase \"[[Keeping up with the Joneses]]\", due to her belief that fashionable society would always strive to keep up with her.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/realestate/real-estate-of-edith-whartons-the-age-of-innocence.html?_r=1|title=New York Times|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=Jan 2, 2014|work=A Pair of Bluebloods With Blueprints Real Estate of Edith Wharton\u2019s \u2018The Age of Innocence\u2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613024035/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/realestate/real-estate-of-edith-whartons-the-age-of-innocence.html?_r=1|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Mrs. Augusta Welland ===\nMay's mother, who has raised her daughter to be a proper society lady. May's dullness, lack of imagination, and rigid views of appropriate and inappropriate behavior are a consequence of this influence. Augusta has effectively trained her husband, the weak-willed Mr. Welland, to conform to her desires and wishes. Mrs. Welland is the driving force behind May's commitment to a long engagement. Without her mother's influence, May might have agreed sooner to Newland's request for an earlier wedding date. After a few years of marriage, Newland Archer foresees in May the attributes of his mother-in-law \u2014 a woman who is stolid, unimaginative, and dull. Later he comes to experience the same molding by May which was imposed upon Mr. Welland.\n\n== Minor characters ==\n*'''Christine Nilsson''': A famous singer who performs in an opera on the night of Archer and May's engagement. She sings in the same opera two years later.\n* '''Mrs. Lovell Mingott''': May and Ellen's aunt, and the daughter-in-law of Mrs. Manson Mingott.\n* '''Lawrence Lefferts''': A wealthy young man and a member of Archer's social circle. He is considered the expert on manners. Archer believes that Lefferts is behind New York society's rude refusal to attend the welcome dinner for Ellen. According to Archer, Lefferts makes a big show of his morality every time that his wife, Mrs. Gertrude Lefferts, suspects that he is having an affair.\n* '''Sillerton Jackson''': The expert on the families that make up New York society. He knows who is related to whom, and the history of every important family. Mrs. Archer and Janey invite him over for dinner when they want to catch up on gossip.\n* '''Julius Beaufort''': An arrogant British banker who tries to have an affair with Ellen. He even follows her to Skuytercliff during the weekend that Archer goes to visit Ellen. His banking business eventually fails, and he leaves New York society in disgrace. His downfall is probably inspired by  the [[Panic of 1873]].\n* '''Regina Beaufort''': Julius Beaufort's wife and Mrs. Manson Mingott's niece. She comes to Mrs. Mingott to ask for a loan when her husband's bank fails. Her visit causes Mrs. Mingott to have a stroke.\n* '''Janey Archer''': Archer's dowdy, unmarried sister who never goes out and relies on Archer. She and her mother invite guests to dinner so they can gossip about New York society. Janey disapproves of Ellen, because she is unconventional and independent, and does not simply tolerate her husband's abuse.\n* '''Mrs. Adeline Archer''': Archer's widowed mother. She does not get out to events often, but loves to hear about society. She and Janey strongly believe in the values of New York society. Like Janey, she views Ellen with suspicion. Henry van der Luyden is her cousin. She is said to be based partly on Edith Wharton's own mother, Lucretia Rhinelander.\n* '''Mrs. Lemuel Struthers''': A woman on the fringes of New York society. She is treated with mistrust and scorn until Ellen befriends her. She eventually becomes popular; at the end of the novel, May thinks it appropriate to go to her parties.\n* '''Count Olenski''': Ellen's husband, a dissolute aristocrat who drove Ellen away with neglect and misery. At first, Count Olenski is content to let Ellen go. Later, though, he sends his secretary to America to ask Ellen to return, with the stipulation that she only appear as his hostess occasionally. He never appears in the story, but is described as half paralyzed and very pale, with thick feminine eyelashes. He constantly cheats on Ellen, and a veiled remark of Lefferts' implies that he copulates with men, too. What other abuses and infidelities he commits are unknown, but he seems quite malicious.\n* '''Sophy Jackson''': Sillerton Jackson's unmarried sister. She is a friend of Janey and Mrs. Archer.\n* '''Louisa and Henry van der Luyden''': Cousins of the Archers, and the most powerful people in New York society. They only mingle with people when they are trying to save society. Mrs. Archer goes to the Van der Luydens after New York society snubs Ellen. They invite her to a very exclusive party in honor of the Duke of St. Austrey to show society that they support her. They are said to be based on the [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselaers]], who were cousins of Edith Wharton.\n* '''Duke of St Austrey''': An English Duke. A cousin of the Van der Luydens, he is the guest of honor at a dinner party thrown by them. Both Ellen and Archer find him dull.\n* '''Nastasia''': Ellen's Italian maid. She invites Archer and the other guests to wait in Ellen's sitting room.\n* '''Mr. Letterblair''': The senior partner of Archer's law firm. He gives Archer the responsibility of talking Ellen out of her plans to divorce the Count.\n* '''Mrs. Rushworth''': The vain married woman with whom Archer had an affair before his engagement to May.\n* '''Ned Winsett''': A journalist. He and Archer are friends, despite their different social circles. He is one of the few people with whom Archer feels that he can have a meaningful conversation. Ned Winsett challenges Archer to think of things outside society.\n* '''Reggie Chivers''': An important member of society. Archer spends a weekend at their country home on the Hudson River.\n* '''Marchioness Medora Manson''': The aunt who took Ellen to Europe as a child.

He fascinates Archer with his life story and intellect. Later, Archer learns that he was Count Olenski's secretary and the man who helped Ellen escape her marriage. The count sends him to Boston to try to convince Ellen to return to Europe.\n* '''Blenker family''': The unfashionable, socially inferior family with whom the Marchioness and Ellen stay while in Newport. They are the guests of honor at Mrs. Emerson Sillerton's party, and seem to be a clever, kind bunch.\n* '''Dallas Archer''': May and Archer's eldest child. He takes his father on a trip to Europe. Through Dallas, Archer learns that May felt sorry for his empty heart after Ellen left.\n* '''Fanny Beaufort''': Dallas Archer's fianc\u00e9e and the daughter of Julius Beaufort and his second wife. She asks Dallas to visit Ellen while he and Archer are in Paris.\n\n== Themes  ==\nOne of the most prominent themes that can be seen throughout the text is the idea of wealth and social class. The characters take pride in their social standings and those that come from \"old money\" feel threatened by those that are coming from \"new money\". The characters' lives revolve around staying up to date on the latest fashion, gatherings, appearances, etc. Being accepted by this high society is the most important thing to the people in this novel and they're willing to do anything to be accepted. Being accepted by high-class acquaintances is another common theme that is displayed throughout this novel. Another theme that is clear in the novel is love, whether it be the love between Newland Archer and May Wellend, or the undeniable love and lust between Newland Archer and Ellen Olenska. Newland Archer's infatuation with May Welland's innocence can't be missed in the beginning scenes of the novel. The theme of innocence changes throughout the novel, as May states she is pregnant only to ensure that Ellen stays away from Newland.\n\n== Reception ==\nSome believe that ''The Age of Innocence'' was one of Wharton's best pieces of literature. If people disagreed that it was her best novel, they certainly couldn't disagree that it was Wharton's most famous novel. Many believe that much of Wharton's own life came through in her work. \"Ms. Wharton often employed dichotomy in her own life: her role as socialite and author, woman of old New York and European maverick, and her life as spouse or beloved. Compartmentalizing her life\u2019s roles prevented her from having to compromise the distinct qualities of each paradigm. Similarly, in ''The Age of Innocence'', Ellen and May are completely opposite representations of life and culture in the 1870\u2019s who cannot happily coexist together.

It was her twelfth novel, and was initially serialized in 1920 in four parts, in the magazine ''[[Pictorial Review]]''. Later that year, it was released as a book by [[D. Appleton & Company]]. It won the [[1921 Pulitzer Prize|1921 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]], making Wharton the first woman to win the prize.<ref>Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''.

Wharton wrote the book in her 50s, after she had established herself as a strong author, with publishers clamoring for her work.\n\n[[File:The Age of Innocence - Reynolds.jpg|thumbnail|right|''[[The Age of Innocence (painting)|The Age of Innocence]]'', a character study by the Englishman [[Joshua Reynolds]] completed in either 1785 or 1788, is believed to have been the inspiration for the title of Wharton's novel.]]\n\n== Background ==\n''The Age of Innocence'', which was set in the time of Wharton's childhood, was a softer and gentler work than ''[[The House of Mirth]]'', which Wharton had published in 1905. In her autobiography, Wharton wrote of ''The Age of Innocence'' that it had allowed her to find \"a momentary escape in going back to my childish memories of a long-vanished America... it was growing more and more evident that the world I had grown up in and been formed by had been destroyed in 1914.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Backward Glance: An Autobiography |last=Wharton |first=Edith |publisher=The Curtis Publishing Co. |year=1933 |isbn=|location=New York |pages=56}}</ref> Scholars and readers alike agree that ''The Age of Innocence'' is fundamentally a story which struggles to reconcile the old with the new.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Edith Wharton's Old New York Society |last=Zihala |first=Maryann |publisher=University Press of America |year=2002 |isbn= |location=New York |pages=33}}</ref>\n\nWharton was raised in the old world of rigid and proper New York society which features in the story. She had spent her middle years, including the whole of [[World War I]], in Europe, where the devastation of a new kind of mechanized warfare was felt most deeply. As explained by Millicent Bell in the Cambridge companion to Wharton, \"''The Age of Innocence'' was composed and first read in the aftermath of [[Theodore Roosevelt|[Theodore] Roosevelt]]'s death and in the immediate wake of World War I. We frame the ending remembering the multiple losses... not only the loss of Roosevelt but the destruction of the prewar world and all that Wharton valued in it.\"<ref name=\"BellCambridge\">{{Cite book |title=Cambridge Companion to Wharton |last=Bell |first=Millicent |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn= |location=Cambridge |pages=20}}</ref>\n\n''The Age of Innocence'' centers on an upper-class couple's impending marriage, and the introduction of the bride's cousin, plagued by scandal, whose presence threatens their happiness. Though the novel questions the assumptions and morals of 1870s New York society, it never develops into an outright condemnation of the institution. The novel is noted for Wharton's attention to detail and its accurate portrayal of how the 19th-century East Coast [[American upper class]] lived, as well as for the social tragedy of its plot. Wharton was 58 years old at publication; she had lived in that world and had seen it change dramatically by the end of World War I.\n\nThe title is an ironic comment on the polished outward manners of New York society when compared to its inward machinations. It is believed to have been drawn from the popular painting ''A Little Girl'' by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]] that later became known as ''The Age of Innocence'' and was widely reproduced as the commercial face of childhood in the later half of the 18th century.<ref>[[Martin Postle|Postle, Martin]].

Yet he finds reason to doubt his choice of bride after the appearance of Countess Ellen Olenska, May's exotic and beautiful 30-year-old cousin. Olenska strikes Archer as the opposite of the innocent and ignorant May Welland. Ellen has returned to New York from Europe after scandalously separating herself (per rumor) from a disastrous marriage to a Polish count. At first, Ellen's arrival and its potential taint on the reputation of his bride-to-be's family disturbs Newland, but he becomes intrigued by the worldly Ellen, who brazenly flouts New York society's fastidious rules. As Newland's admiration for the countess grows, so do his doubts about marrying May, a perfect product of Old New York society; his match with May no longer seems the ideal fate he had imagined.\n\nEllen's decision to divorce Count Olenski causes a social crisis for the other members of her family, who are terrified of scandal and disgrace. Living apart can be tolerated, but divorce is unacceptable. To save the Welland family's reputation, a law partner of Newland asks him to dissuade Countess Olenska from going through with the divorce. He succeeds, but in the process comes to care for her. Afraid of falling in love with Ellen, Newland begs May to accelerate their wedding date, but she refuses.\n\nNewland tells Ellen he loves her; Ellen corresponds, but is horrified that their love will aggrieve May. She agrees to remain in America, separated but still married to Count Olenski, only if they do not sexually consummate their love. Newland receives May's telegram agreeing to wed sooner.\n\nNewland and May marry. He tries unsuccessfully to forget Ellen. His society marriage is mediocre, and the social life he once found absorbing has become empty and joyless. Though Ellen lives in Washington and has remained distant, he is unable to cease loving her. Their paths cross while he and May are in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. Newland discovers that Count Olenski wishes Ellen to return to him, but she has refused, although her family wants her to reconcile with her husband and return to Europe. Frustrated by her independence, the family has cut off her money, as the count had already done.\n\nNewland desperately seeks a way to leave May and be with Ellen, obsessed with how to finally possess her. Despairing of ever making Ellen his wife, he urges her to become his mistress. Then Ellen is recalled to New York City to care for her sick grandmother, who accepts her decision to remain separated and agrees to reinstate her allowance.\n\nBack in New York and under renewed pressure from Newland, Ellen relents and agrees to consummate their relationship. However, Newland then discovers that Ellen has decided to return to Europe. Newland makes up his mind to abandon May and follow Ellen to Europe when May announces that she and Newland are throwing a farewell party for Ellen. That night, after the party, Newland resolves to tell May he is leaving her for Ellen. She interrupts him to tell him that she learned that morning that she is pregnant; she reveals that she had told Ellen of her pregnancy two weeks earlier, despite not being sure of it at the time. The implication is that May did so because she suspected the affair and that this is Ellen's reason for returning to Europe. Hopelessly trapped, Newland decides to remain with May and not to follow Ellen, surrendering his love for the sake of his child.\n\nTwenty-six years later, after May's death, Newland and his eldest son are in Paris. The son, learning that his mother's cousin lives there, has arranged to visit Ellen in her Paris apartment. Newland is stunned at the prospect of seeing Ellen again. On arriving outside the apartment building, Newland sends up his son alone to meet Ellen, while he waits outside, watching the balcony of her apartment. Newland considers going up, but in the end decides not to; he walks back to his hotel without seeing her. Newland's final words about the love affair were \"It's more real to me here than if I went up.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Age Of Innocence|last=Wharton|first=Edith|publisher=Black & White Classics|year=2015|isbn=9781508475576|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Major characters==\n\n=== Newland Archer ===\nThe story's protagonist is a young, popular, and successful lawyer living with his mother and sister in an elegant New York City house. Since childhood, his life has been shaped by the customs and expectations of upper-class New York City society. His engagement to May Welland is one in a string of accomplishments. At the story's start, he is proud and content to dream about a traditional marriage in which he will be the husband-teacher and she the wife-student. His life changes when he meets Countess Ellen Olenska. Through his relationship with her\u2014first friendship, then love\u2014he begins questioning the values on which he was raised. He sees the sexual inequality of New York society and the shallowness of its customs, and struggles to balance social commitment to May with love for Ellen. He cannot find a place for their love in the intricate, judgmental web of New York society. Throughout the story's progress, he transgresses the boundaries of acceptable behavior for love of Ellen: first following her to Skuytercliff, then Boston, and finally deciding to follow her to Europe (though he later changes his mind). In the end, though, Newland Archer finds that the only place for their love is in his memories. Some scholars see Wharton most projected onto Newland's character, rather than Ellen Olenska.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Critical Reception of Edith Wharton|last=Killoran|first=Hellen|publisher=Camden House|year=2001|isbn=|location=Rochester|pages=90}}</ref>\n\n=== May Welland ===\nNewland Archer's fianc\u00e9e, then wife. Raised to be a perfect wife and mother, she follows and perfectly obeys all of society's customs. Mostly, she is the shallow, uninterested and uninteresting young woman that New York society requires. When they are in St. Augustine, though, May gives Newland a rare glimpse of the maturity and compassion he had previously ignored. She offers to release him from their engagement so he can marry the woman he truly loves, thinking he wants to be with Mrs. Rushworth, a married woman with whom he had recently ended a love affair. When he assures May that he loves only her, May appears to trust him, at least at first. Yet after their marriage, she suspects that Newland is Ellen's lover. Nonetheless, May pretends to be happy before society, maintaining the illusion that she and he have the perfect marriage expected of them. Her unhappiness activates her manipulative nature, and Newland does not see it until too late. To drive Ellen away from him, May tells Ellen of her pregnancy before she is certain of it. Yet there still is compassion in May, even in their loveless marriage's long years after Ellen's leaving. After May's death, Newland Archer learns she had always known of his continued love for Ellen; as May lay dying, she told their son Dallas that the children could always trust their father, Newland, because he surrendered the thing most meaningful to him out of loyalty to their marriage. May is a picture of Innocence.\n\n=== Ellen Olenska ===\nMay's cousin and Mrs. Manson Mingott's granddaughter. She became a countess by marrying Polish Count Olenski, a European nobleman. Her husband was allegedly cruel and abusive, stole Ellen's fortune and had affairs with other women. When the story begins, Ellen has fled her unhappy marriage, lived in Venice with her husband's secretary, and has returned to her family in New York City. She is a free spirit who helps Newland Archer see beyond narrow New York society. She treats her maid, Nastasia, as an equal, offering the servant her own cape before sending her out on an errand. She attends parties with disreputable people such as Julius Beaufort and Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, and she invites Newland, the fianc\u00e9 of her cousin May, to visit her. Ellen suffers as much as Newland from their impossible love, but she is willing to live in emotional limbo so long as they can love each other at a distance. Ellen's love for Newland drives her important decisions: dropping divorce from Count Olenski, remaining in America, and offering Newland choice of sexual consummation only once, and then disappearing from his life. Her conscience and responsibility to family complicate her love for Newland. When she learns of May's pregnancy, Ellen immediately decides to leave America, refusing Newland's attempt to follow her to Europe, and so allow cousin May to start her family with her husband Newland. The reception of Ellen's character has changed over time. From a willful temptress to a fabulously independent woman, far ahead of her time, one thing is for certain: \u201cEllen has only to walk alone across a drawing room to offend its definitions.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Wharton|last=Bell|first=Millicent|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=32}}</ref>\n\n=== Mrs. Manson Mingott ===\nThe matriarch of the powerful Mingott family, and grandmother to Ellen and May. She was born Catherine Spicer, to an inconsequential family. Widowed at 28, she has ensured her family's social position through her own shrewdness and force of character. She controls her family: at Newland's request, she has May and Mrs. Welland agree to an earlier wedding date. She controls the money\u2014withholding Ellen's living allowance (when the family is angry with Ellen), and having niece Regina Beaufort ask for money when in financial trouble. Mrs. Mingott is a maverick in the polite world of New York society, at times pushing the boundaries of acceptable behavior, such as receiving guests in her house's ground floor, though society associates that practice with women of questionable morals. Her welcoming Ellen is viewed skeptically, and she insists the rest of the family support Ellen. Mrs. Mingott was inspired by Edith Wharton's own portly great-great-aunt, Mary Mason Jones, who is said to have given rise to the phrase \"[[Keeping up with the Joneses]]\", due to her belief that fashionable society would always strive to keep up with her.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/realestate/real-estate-of-edith-whartons-the-age-of-innocence.html?_r=1|title=New York Times|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=Jan 2, 2014|work=A Pair of Bluebloods With Blueprints Real Estate of Edith Wharton\u2019s \u2018The Age of Innocence\u2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613024035/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/realestate/real-estate-of-edith-whartons-the-age-of-innocence.html?_r=1|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Mrs. Augusta Welland ===\nMay's mother, who has raised her daughter to be a proper society lady. May's dullness, lack of imagination, and rigid views of appropriate and inappropriate behavior are a consequence of this influence. Augusta has effectively trained her husband, the weak-willed Mr. Welland, to conform to her desires and wishes. Mrs. Welland is the driving force behind May's commitment to a long engagement. Without her mother's influence, May might have agreed sooner to Newland's request for an earlier wedding date. After a few years of marriage, Newland Archer foresees in May the attributes of his mother-in-law \u2014 a woman who is stolid, unimaginative, and dull. Later he comes to experience the same molding by May which was imposed upon Mr. Welland.\n\n== Minor characters ==\n*'''Christine Nilsson''': A famous singer who performs in an opera on the night of Archer and May's engagement. She sings in the same opera two years later.\n* '''Mrs. Lovell Mingott''': May and Ellen's aunt, and the daughter-in-law of Mrs. Manson Mingott.\n* '''Lawrence Lefferts''': A wealthy young man and a member of Archer's social circle. He is considered the expert on manners. Archer believes that Lefferts is behind New York society's rude refusal to attend the welcome dinner for Ellen. According to Archer, Lefferts makes a big show of his morality every time that his wife, Mrs. Gertrude Lefferts, suspects that he is having an affair.\n* '''Sillerton Jackson''': The expert on the families that make up New York society. He knows who is related to whom, and the history of every important family. Mrs. Archer and Janey invite him over for dinner when they want to catch up on gossip.\n* '''Julius Beaufort''': An arrogant British banker who tries to have an affair with Ellen. He even follows her to Skuytercliff during the weekend that Archer goes to visit Ellen. His banking business eventually fails, and he leaves New York society in disgrace. His downfall is probably inspired by  the [[Panic of 1873]].\n* '''Regina Beaufort''': Julius Beaufort's wife and Mrs. Manson Mingott's niece. She comes to Mrs. Mingott to ask for a loan when her husband's bank fails. Her visit causes Mrs. Mingott to have a stroke.\n* '''Janey Archer''': Archer's dowdy, unmarried sister who never goes out and relies on Archer. She and her mother invite guests to dinner so they can gossip about New York society. Janey disapproves of Ellen, because she is unconventional and independent, and does not simply tolerate her husband's abuse.\n* '''Mrs. Adeline Archer''': Archer's widowed mother. She does not get out to events often, but loves to hear about society. She and Janey strongly believe in the values of New York society. Like Janey, she views Ellen with suspicion. Henry van der Luyden is her cousin. She is said to be based partly on Edith Wharton's own mother, Lucretia Rhinelander.\n* '''Mrs. Lemuel Struthers''': A woman on the fringes of New York society. She is treated with mistrust and scorn until Ellen befriends her. She eventually becomes popular; at the end of the novel, May thinks it appropriate to go to her parties.\n* '''Count Olenski''': Ellen's husband, a dissolute aristocrat who drove Ellen away with neglect and misery. At first, Count Olenski is content to let Ellen go. Later, though, he sends his secretary to America to ask Ellen to return, with the stipulation that she only appear as his hostess occasionally. He never appears in the story, but is described as half paralyzed and very pale, with thick feminine eyelashes. He constantly cheats on Ellen, and a veiled remark of Lefferts' implies that he copulates with men, too. What other abuses and infidelities he commits are unknown, but he seems quite malicious.\n* '''Sophy Jackson''': Sillerton Jackson's unmarried sister. She is a friend of Janey and Mrs. Archer.\n* '''Louisa and Henry van der Luyden''': Cousins of the Archers, and the most powerful people in New York society. They only mingle with people when they are trying to save society. Mrs. Archer goes to the Van der Luydens after New York society snubs Ellen. They invite her to a very exclusive party in honor of the Duke of St. Austrey to show society that they support her. They are said to be based on the [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselaers]], who were cousins of Edith Wharton.\n* '''Duke of St Austrey''': An English Duke. A cousin of the Van der Luydens, he is the guest of honor at a dinner party thrown by them. Both Ellen and Archer find him dull.\n* '''Nastasia''': Ellen's Italian maid. She invites Archer and the other guests to wait in Ellen's sitting room.\n* '''Mr. Letterblair''': The senior partner of Archer's law firm. He gives Archer the responsibility of talking Ellen out of her plans to divorce the Count.\n* '''Mrs. Rushworth''': The vain married woman with whom Archer had an affair before his engagement to May.\n* '''Ned Winsett''': A journalist. He and Archer are friends, despite their different social circles. He is one of the few people with whom Archer feels that he can have a meaningful conversation. Ned Winsett challenges Archer to think of things outside society.\n* '''Reggie Chivers''': An important member of society. Archer spends a weekend at their country home on the Hudson River.\n* '''Marchioness Medora Manson''': The aunt who took Ellen to Europe as a child.

Beaufort's bank failure eventually ruins Mrs. Manson's fortune, and she moves back to Europe with Ellen.\n* '''Dr. Agathon Carver''': A friend (and possible love interest) of the Marchioness Manson. Archer meets him at Ellen's house.\n* '''Du Lac aunts''': Archer's elderly aunts. They offer their country home to May and Archer for their honeymoon.\n* '''Mrs. Carfry''': An English acquaintance of Janey and Mrs. Archer. She invites Archer and May to a dinner party while they are on their European wedding tour.\n* '''M. Rivi\u00e8re''': The French tutor of Mrs. Carfry's nephew. He fascinates Archer with his life story and intellect. Later, Archer learns that he was Count Olenski's secretary and the man who helped Ellen escape her marriage. The count sends him to Boston to try to convince Ellen to return to Europe.\n* '''Blenker family''': The unfashionable, socially inferior family with whom the Marchioness and Ellen stay while in Newport. They are the guests of honor at Mrs. Emerson Sillerton's party, and seem to be a clever, kind bunch.\n* '''Dallas Archer''': May and Archer's eldest child. He takes his father on a trip to Europe. Through Dallas, Archer learns that May felt sorry for his empty heart after Ellen left.\n* '''Fanny Beaufort''': Dallas Archer's fianc\u00e9e and the daughter of Julius Beaufort and his second wife. She asks Dallas to visit Ellen while he and Archer are in Paris.\n\n== Themes  ==\nOne of the most prominent themes that can be seen throughout the text is the idea of wealth and social class. The characters take pride in their social standings and those that come from \"old money\" feel threatened by those that are coming from \"new money\". The characters' lives revolve around staying up to date on the latest fashion, gatherings, appearances, etc. Being accepted by this high society is the most important thing to the people in this novel and they're willing to do anything to be accepted. Being accepted by high-class acquaintances is another common theme that is displayed throughout this novel. Another theme that is clear in the novel is love, whether it be the love between Newland Archer and May Wellend, or the undeniable love and lust between Newland Archer and Ellen Olenska. Newland Archer's infatuation with May Welland's innocence can't be missed in the beginning scenes of the novel. The theme of innocence changes throughout the novel, as May states she is pregnant only to ensure that Ellen stays away from Newland.\n\n== Reception ==\nSome believe that ''The Age of Innocence'' was one of Wharton's best pieces of literature. If people disagreed that it was her best novel, they certainly couldn't disagree that it was Wharton's most famous novel. Many believe that much of Wharton's own life came through in her work. \"Ms. Wharton often employed dichotomy in her own life: her role as socialite and author, woman of old New York and European maverick, and her life as spouse or beloved.
