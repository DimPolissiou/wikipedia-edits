Czech victims and those transiting the country are trafficked to Western Europe and the United States, sometimes via third countries. Internal trafficking occurs from low employment areas to Prague and regions bordering [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. Ethnic [[Romani People|Roma]] women are at the highest risk for internal trafficking, and almost always are trafficked by a relative or someone known to them previously.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/47255.pdf|title = 2005 \"Trafficking in Persons Report\"|accessdate = 5 October 2006|author = US Department of State|authorlink = United States Department of State|date = 3 June 2005}}</ref>  There have recently been unconfirmed reports of Roma children as young as 13 who have either sold themselves or been sold by others for acts of prostitution in Brno, the second largest city in the Czech Republic, where drug abuse among Roma teenagers is alarmingly prevalent.\n\nThe Government of the Czech Republic fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. In 2004, the Czech Government strengthened its anti-trafficking legislation and turned its pilot victim assistance program into a nationwide government-funded program. While enforcement statistics improved during the reporting period, sentences imposed on traffickers remained low.\n\n===Prosecution===\nThe Czech police increased its capacity to investigate and convict traffickers over the reporting period, although the overall numbers of cases prosecuted pursuant to anti-trafficking legislation remained low and sentences imposed remained weak. Amendments to the Czech Penal Code went into effect in November 2004, making all forms of trafficking illegal, including labor exploitation and internal trafficking. Maximum trafficking penalties were increased from 12 to 15 years, with a minimum penalty of two years. In 2004, Czech authorities investigated 30 individuals and prosecuted 19 under the trafficking statutes. The courts convicted 12 traffickers under those statutes, an increase from five in 2003. Of the 12 convicted, three received unconditional prison sentences of three to five years, and nine received conditional or suspended sentences. Police training curricula included segments on trafficking, and a new internal website for police provided trafficking awareness information. While no government officials were indicted or convicted for complicity in trafficking, allegations continued about the involvement of individual border police officers facilitating illegal border crossings. Czech law enforcement conducted joint anti-trafficking investigations with Germany, Slovakia, Austria, Poland, and Ukraine in 2004.\n\n===Protection===\nThe Czech Government continued to improve trafficking protection and assistance. In November 2004, the Model of Support and Protection of Victims of Trafficking in Persons was expanded to a permanent, government-funded program that is open to all foreign and Czech victims. This program involves close cooperation between the government and NGOs, and allows the victims a 30-day reflection period to receive assistance and consider whether to assist in prosecuting their traffickers. From January 2004 to January 2005, 14 trafficking victims \u2014 including one forced labor victim \u2014 took part in the program. Many victims chose to apply for asylum, which allows them legal status in the Czech Republic until their cases are decided \u2014 a process which can take months or years. The government houses victims and potential victims applying for asylum with other at-risk groups in guarded asylum centers to prevent unwanted contact with traffickers. The government funded several NGOs and international organizations for sheltering and care of victims; two of the Czech Republic's principal organizations provided shelter to 68 trafficking victims in 2004.\n\n===Prevention===\nThe Ministry of Interior is currently collaborating with IOM to produce a demand-reduction campaign targeting clients of commercial sex outlets along the Czech-German border area. A government-fund-ed NGO conducted awareness campaigns among potential trafficking victims at schools and asylum centers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to provide trafficking information to applicants for Czech visas from identified trafficking source countries. The Crime Prevention Department continued awareness programs at schools. In addition to the Czech National Action Plan on trafficking adopted in 2003, the government in July 2004 adopted a plan to combat commercial sexual abuse of children.\n\n==Failed legalization attempt==\nProstitutes in the Czech Republic work in a legal grey area, neither explicitly legal nor illegal, which makes it difficult for the state to control disease, the sex-slave trade and underage prostitution.\n\nThe Czech government has attempted to legalize and regulate prostitution, but these efforts have failed.\n\nIn 2005, the Czech government approved a law to license prostitutes and confine the trade to certain areas as part of an effort to curb prostitution and reduce organized crime.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-111248506.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140610052402/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-111248506.html|url-status=dead|archive-date = 10 June 2014|title = Czech Republic to License Prostitution|accessdate = 23 March 2012|agency = Associated Press|authorlink = Associated Press|date = 21 July 2005|work = SFGate.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/czech-republic-moves-to-legalise-prostitution-1.245503|title = Czech Republic moves to legalise prostitution|accessdate = 23 March 2012|agency = Associated Press|authorlink = Associated Press|date = 4 July 2005|work = Independent Online}}</ref> However, the law needed the approval of the parliament and the parliament failed to approve it.\n\n\"The assumption is that it is unrealistic to effectively ban prostitution,\" the ministry proposal said. \"It is only possible ... to set rules so the public does not perceive prostitution as a serious public order problem or health risk.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20040428-0821-czech-prostitution.html|title = Czech govt backs plan to make sex trade legal|accessdate = 4 October 2006|agency = Reuters|authorlink = Reuters|date = 28 April 2004|website = SignOnSanDiego.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070225045212/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20040428-0821-czech-prostitution.html|archivedate = 25 February 2007|df = }}</ref>\n\nThe plan called for prostitutes to buy licenses, undergo monthly health checks, pay taxes and have health insurance.

We believe that such action would be a terrible mistake for the country as a whole and, in particular, for the women and children of the Eastern Europe region who will be victims of the Czech Republic sex trade ... We are certain that legalizing prostitution within the Czech Republic will not curb abuses such as child prostitution and enslaving sex trafficking. Organized crime controls the \"industry\" and, in a legalized regime, it will have an enhanced capacity to do so ... Brothels are sexual gulags for women and girls ... A decision to accommodate traffickers, pimps, and organized crime's slave trade in girls and women [is] an act unworthy of Czechs' traditions of fighting for their own freedom. It is an act we will resist with every democratic means available to us, and will fight in Congress and our legislatures, through our organized women's movements and from tens of thousands of church and synagogue pulpits. At a minimum, we are determined that our efforts will in financial terms alone, be more costly to the Republic \u2014 and not in terms of tourism alone \u2014 than any hypothetical financial gains claimed. We close by urging you to reject the calls for legalization that sully the reputation of the Czech Republic and dishonor its history.

Ever since the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[Velvet Revolution]] (1989) led to the creation of the two independent states Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]], [[prostitution]] has been flourishing and has contributed its share to the region's booming tourist economy. It is widespread in [[Prague]] and areas near the Republic's western borders with [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].

Most of the country's prostitution centers in the Northern Bohemia and Western Bohemia regions and in the capital city. Brothels line the country's roads to Austria and Germany, the source of many customers.

Czech victims and those transiting the country are trafficked to Western Europe and the United States, sometimes via third countries. Internal trafficking occurs from low employment areas to Prague and regions bordering [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. Ethnic [[Romani People|Roma]] women are at the highest risk for internal trafficking, and almost always are trafficked by a relative or someone known to them previously.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/47255.pdf|title = 2005 \"Trafficking in Persons Report\"|accessdate = 5 October 2006|author = US Department of State|authorlink = United States Department of State|date = 3 June 2005}}</ref>  There have recently been unconfirmed reports of Roma children as young as 13 who have either sold themselves or been sold by others for acts of prostitution in Brno, the second largest city in the Czech Republic, where drug abuse among Roma teenagers is alarmingly prevalent.\n\nThe Government of the Czech Republic fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. In 2004, the Czech Government strengthened its anti-trafficking legislation and turned its pilot victim assistance program into a nationwide government-funded program. While enforcement statistics improved during the reporting period, sentences imposed on traffickers remained low.\n\n===Prosecution===\nThe Czech police increased its capacity to investigate and convict traffickers over the reporting period, although the overall numbers of cases prosecuted pursuant to anti-trafficking legislation remained low and sentences imposed remained weak. Amendments to the Czech Penal Code went into effect in November 2004, making all forms of trafficking illegal, including labor exploitation and internal trafficking. Maximum trafficking penalties were increased from 12 to 15 years, with a minimum penalty of two years. In 2004, Czech authorities investigated 30 individuals and prosecuted 19 under the trafficking statutes. The courts convicted 12 traffickers under those statutes, an increase from five in 2003. Of the 12 convicted, three received unconditional prison sentences of three to five years, and nine received conditional or suspended sentences. Police training curricula included segments on trafficking, and a new internal website for police provided trafficking awareness information. While no government officials were indicted or convicted for complicity in trafficking, allegations continued about the involvement of individual border police officers facilitating illegal border crossings. Czech law enforcement conducted joint anti-trafficking investigations with Germany, Slovakia, Austria, Poland, and Ukraine in 2004.\n\n===Protection===\nThe Czech Government continued to improve trafficking protection and assistance. In November 2004, the Model of Support and Protection of Victims of Trafficking in Persons was expanded to a permanent, government-funded program that is open to all foreign and Czech victims. This program involves close cooperation between the government and NGOs, and allows the victims a 30-day reflection period to receive assistance and consider whether to assist in prosecuting their traffickers. From January 2004 to January 2005, 14 trafficking victims \u2014 including one forced labor victim \u2014 took part in the program. Many victims chose to apply for asylum, which allows them legal status in the Czech Republic until their cases are decided \u2014 a process which can take months or years. The government houses victims and potential victims applying for asylum with other at-risk groups in guarded asylum centers to prevent unwanted contact with traffickers. The government funded several NGOs and international organizations for sheltering and care of victims; two of the Czech Republic\u2019s principal organizations provided shelter to 68 trafficking victims in 2004.\n\n===Prevention===\nThe Ministry of Interior is currently collaborating with IOM to produce a demand-reduction campaign targeting clients of commercial sex outlets along the Czech-German border area. A government-fund-ed NGO conducted awareness campaigns among potential trafficking victims at schools and asylum centers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to provide trafficking information to applicants for Czech visas from identified trafficking source countries. The Crime Prevention Department continued awareness programs at schools. In addition to the Czech National Action Plan on trafficking adopted in 2003, the government in July 2004 adopted a plan to combat commercial sexual abuse of children.\n\n==Failed legalization attempt==\nProstitutes in the Czech Republic work in a legal grey area, neither explicitly legal nor illegal, which makes it difficult for the state to control disease, the sex-slave trade and underage prostitution.\n\nThe Czech government has attempted to legalize and regulate prostitution, but these efforts have failed.\n\nIn 2005, the Czech government approved a law to license prostitutes and confine the trade to certain areas as part of an effort to curb prostitution and reduce organized crime.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-111248506.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140610052402/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-111248506.html|url-status=dead|archive-date = 10 June 2014|title = Czech Republic to License Prostitution|accessdate = 23 March 2012|agency = Associated Press|authorlink = Associated Press|date = 21 July 2005|work = SFGate.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/czech-republic-moves-to-legalise-prostitution-1.245503|title = Czech Republic moves to legalise prostitution|accessdate = 23 March 2012|agency = Associated Press|authorlink = Associated Press|date = 4 July 2005|work = Independent Online}}</ref> However, the law needed the approval of the parliament and the parliament failed to approve it.\n\n\"The assumption is that it is unrealistic to effectively ban prostitution,\" the ministry proposal said. \"It is only possible ... to set rules so the public does not perceive prostitution as a serious public order problem or health risk.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20040428-0821-czech-prostitution.html|title = Czech govt backs plan to make sex trade legal|accessdate = 4 October 2006|agency = Reuters|authorlink = Reuters|date = 28 April 2004|website = SignOnSanDiego.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070225045212/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20040428-0821-czech-prostitution.html|archivedate = 25 February 2007|df = }}</ref>\n\nThe plan called for prostitutes to buy licenses, undergo monthly health checks, pay taxes and have health insurance. Annual licenses would have only be issued to Czechs and other [[European Union]] nationals older than 18 who had no criminal record. It would have been illegal to operate without a license, and those who refused to register would have been prosecuted and would have faced fines. Soliciting sex would have been banned near schools, playgrounds, churches and cemeteries.\n\nThe general opinion is that while prostitution should be legal and sex workers registered, politicians seem unwilling to take a stand and many doubt that workers would register in the first place.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.provokator.org/magazine/content/view/139/26/|title = How much is that girlie in the window?

We believe that such action would be a terrible mistake for the country as a whole and, in particular, for the women and children of the Eastern Europe region who will be victims of the Czech Republic sex trade ... We are certain that legalizing prostitution within the Czech Republic will not curb abuses such as child prostitution and enslaving sex trafficking. Organized crime controls the \"industry\" and, in a legalized regime, it will have an enhanced capacity to do so ... Brothels are sexual gulags for women and girls ... A decision to accommodate traffickers, pimps, and organized crime's slave trade in girls and women [is] an act unworthy of Czechs' traditions of fighting for their own freedom. It is an act we will resist with every democratic means available to us, and will fight in Congress and our legislatures, through our organized women's movements and from tens of thousands of church and synagogue pulpits. At a minimum, we are determined that our efforts will in financial terms alone, be more costly to the Republic \u2014 and not in terms of tourism alone \u2014 than any hypothetical financial gains claimed. We close by urging you to reject the calls for legalization that sully the reputation of the Czech Republic and dishonor its history. Please take a leadership role in resisting the trade in women and children and please, in a manner consistent with your traditions, maintain the Republic as a model for human rights and democracy.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nationalreview.com/hughes/hughes200405110833.asp|title = Don't Legalize|accessdate = 2006-10-04|last = Hughes|first = Donna M.|date = May 11, 2004|website = National Review Online|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906095328/http://www.nationalreview.com/hughes/hughes200405110833.asp|archivedate=2008-09-06}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Organisations helping the prostitutes==\n* \"Rozko\u0161 bez rizika\" (R-R, ''Bliss Without Risk'') is a small [[non-governmental organization]], founded in 1992 and funded mainly by the state and municipalities.

The mother, Jeanne Dielman (whose name is only derived from the title and from a letter she reads to her son), [[prostitution|has sex with male clients]] in her house daily for her and her son's subsistence. Like her other activities, Jeanne's sex work is part of the routine she performs every day by rote and is uneventful. But on the second and third day, Jeanne's routine begins to unravel subtly, as she overcooks the potatoes that she's preparing for dinner, and drops a newly washed spoon. These alterations to Jeanne's existence prepare for the climax on the third day, during which she murders a client.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Delphine Seyrig]] as Jeanne Dielman\n* [[Jan Decorte]] as Sylvain Dielman\n* [[Henri Storck]] as the first client\n* [[Jacques Doniol-Valcroze]] as the second client\n* Yves Bical as the third client\n\n==Production==\nAfter establishing herself as a major film director with ''[[Je, tu, il, elle]]'' (1974), Akerman said that she \"felt ready to make a feature with more money\" and applied for a grant from the Belgian government for financial support, submitting a script that Jane Clarke described as portraying \"a rigorous regimen [constructed] around food&nbsp;... and routine bought sex in the afternoon\". This script would only be the rough basis for ''Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles'' because after Akerman received the government grant of $120,000 and began production, she threw the script out and began a new film instead.<ref name=Wakeman>Wakeman, John.

It gives recognition to that kind of woman\".<ref name=Wakeman /> Akerman used an all female crew for the film, which she later said \"didn't work that well - not because they were women but because I didn't choose them. It was enough just to be a woman to work on my film&nbsp;... so the shooting was awful\". Akerman further stated that \"a hierarchy of images\" that places a car accident or a kiss \"higher in the hierarchy than washing up&nbsp;... And it's not by accident, but relates to the place of woman in the social hierarchy&nbsp;... Woman's work comes out of oppression and whatever comes out of oppression is more interesting. You have to be definite.

{"title_page": "Lord Chamberlain's Men", "text_new": "{{short description|16th-century English playing company associated with William Shakespeare}}\n{{More footnotes|date=December 2017}}\n'''The Lord Chamberlain's Men''' was a company of actors, or a \"[[playing company]]\" (as it then would likely have been described), for which [[Shakespeare]] wrote during most of his career. [[Richard Burbage]] played most of the lead roles, including [[Hamlet]], [[Othello]], [[King Lear]], and [[Macbeth]]. Formed at the end of a period of flux in the theatrical world of London, it had become, by 1603, one of the two leading companies of the city and was subsequently patronized by [[James I of England|James I]].\n\nIt was founded during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth the first of England]] in 1594 under the [[patronage]] of [[Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon]], then the [[Lord Chamberlain]], who was in charge of court entertainments. After Carey's death on 23 July 1596, the company came under the patronage of his son, [[George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon]], for whom it was briefly known as '''Lord Hunsdon's Men'''.  When George Carey in turn became Lord Chamberlain on 17 March 1597, it reverted to its previous name. The company became the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] in 1603 when [[James I of England|King James]] ascended the throne and became the companys patron. The company held exclusive rights to perform Shakespeare's plays.\n\n==Playhouses await wot\n[[Image:The Old Globe.jpg|thumb|right|Print, based on Hollar's 1644 Long View of London, of the 1614 second [[Globe Theatre]]]]\nFrom 1594 the players performed at [[The Theatre]], in [[Shoreditch]]. Problems with the landlord caused the company to move to the nearby [[Curtain Theatre]] in 1597. On the night of 29 December 1598, The Theatre was dismantled by the Burbage brothers, along with William Smith, their financial backer, [[Peter Street (carpenter)|Peter Street]], a carpenter, and ten to twelve workmen. The beams were then carried soupth of the river to [[Southwark]] to form part of their new playhouse, the [[Globe Theatre]]. Built in 1599, this theatre was destroyed in a fire on 29 June 1613. The Globe was rebuilt by June 1614 and finally closed in 1642. The company also toured Britain, and visited France and Belgium.\n\nA modern reconstruction of the original Globe, named \"[[Shakespeare's Globe]]\", opened in 1997 near the site of the original theatre.\n\n==Personnel==\n{{main|King's Men personnel}}\nThe initial form of the Chamberlain's men arose largely from the departure of [[Edward Alleyn]] from [[Lord Strange's Men]] and the subsequent death of [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby|Lord Strange]] himself, in the spring of 1594. Yet the ultimate success of the company was largely determined by the Burbage family. [[James Burbage]] was the impresario who assembled the company and directed its activities until his death in 1597; his sons Richard and [[Cuthbert Burbage|Cuthbert]] were members of the company, though Cuthbert did not act. This connection with the Burbages makes the Chamberlain's Men the central link in a chain that extends from the beginning of professional theatre (in 1574, James Burbage led the first group of actors to be protected under the 1572 statute against rogues and vagabonds) in Renaissance London to its end. In 1642, the King's Men were among the acting companies whose activities were ended by [[Parliament's prohibition of the stage]].)\n\nThe Chamberlain's Men comprised a core of eight \"sharers\", who split profits and debts; perhaps an equal number of hired men who acted minor and doubled parts; and a slightly smaller number of [[boy player]]s, who were sometimes bound apprentices to an adult actor. The original sharers in the Chamberlain's were eight. Probably the most famous in the 1590's to the 1600's was [[William Kempe]], who had been in the company of the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]] in the 1580s, and had later joined the King's Men. As the company's clown, he presumably took the broadest comic role in every play; he is identified with Peter in the [[book size|quarto]] of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and probably also originated Dogberry in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and Bottom in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. Kempe has traditionally been viewed as the object of Hamlet's complaint about extemporising clowns; whether this association is right or wrong, Kempe had left the company by 1601. Another two sharers from Strange's Men had a long-standing association with Kempe. [[George Bryan (16th-century actor)|George Bryan]] had been in Leicester's Men in the 1580s, and at [[Elsinore]] with Kempe in 1586; because he is not mentioned in later Chamberlain's or King's Men documents, it is assumed that Bryan retired from the stage in 1597 or 1598. (Bryan lived on for some years; in the reign of [[King James I of England|James]], he is listed as a [[Groom of the Chamber]], with household duties, as late as 1613.) [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], another Leicester's veteran, retired in 1600 and died in 1603. Both Bryan and Pope came to the company from Lord Strange's Men.\n[[Augustine Phillips]] also came from Strange's Men. He remained with the troupe until his death in 1605.\n[[Image:St Leonards Memorial.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial to Tudor actors buried in [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch|Shoreditch church]] \u2013 including [[James Burbage]] and his sons, [[Richard Burbage]] and [[Cuthbert Burbage]], among others]]\nTwo younger actors who came from Strange's, [[Henry Condell]] and [[John Heminges]], are most famous now for collecting and editing the plays of Shakespeare's [[First Folio]] (1623). Both were relatively young in 1594, and both remained with the company until after the death of King James; their presence provided an element of continuity across decades of changing taste and commercial uncertainty.\n\n(Some scholars have theorised that the company maintained its original eight-sharer structure, and that as any man left, through retirement or death, his place as sharer was filled by someone else. So, Bryan was replaced by [[William Sly]], ca. 1597; Kempe was replaced by [[Robert Armin]], ca. 1599; Pope was replaced by Condell, ca. 1600.<ref>Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion'', pp. 90\u201391.</ref> But this scheme, while possible, is not proven by the available evidence.)\n\nThe two sharers who would contribute the most to the Chamberlain's Men did not come from Strange's Men. Shakespeare's activities before 1594 have been a matter of considerable inquiry; he may have been with [[Pembroke's Men]] and [[Derby's Men]] in the early 1590s. As a sharer, he was at first equally important as actor and playwright. At an uncertain but probably early date, his writing became more important, although he continued to act at least until 1603, when he performed in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus]]''.\n\nNo less important was [[Richard Burbage]]. He was the lead actor of the Chamberlain's Men, who played [[Hamlet]] and [[Othello]], and would go on to play [[King Lear]] and [[Macbeth]] in the new reign of King James, among many other roles. Though relatively little-known in 1594, he would become one of the most famous of Renaissance actors, achieving a fame and wealth exceeded only by Alleyn's.\n\nAmong the hired men were some who eventually became sharers. [[William Sly]], who performed occasionally with the [[Admiral's Men]] during the 1590s, acted for the Chamberlain's by 1598, and perhaps before; he became a sharer after Phillips's death in 1605. [[Richard Cowley]], identified as Verges by the [[book size|quarto]] of ''Much Ado About Nothing'', became a sharer in the King's Men. [[Nicholas Tooley]], at one point apprenticed to Burbage, stayed with the company until his death in 1623. [[John Sincler]] (or Sincklo) may have specialised in playing thin characters; he seems to have remained a hired man. John Duke was a hired man who went to [[Worcester's Men]] early in James's reign.\n\nAt least two of the boys had distinguished careers. [[Alexander Cooke]] is associated with a number of Shakespeare's female characters, while [[Christopher Beeston]] went on to become a wealthy impresario in the seventeenth century.\n\n===Later sharers===\nThe core members of the company changed in both major and minor ways before James's accession. The most famous change is that of Will Kemp, the circumstances of which remain unclear. Kempe was among the stakeholders in the Globe property, and he may have performed in that theatre in its first year. His famous morris dance to [[Norwich]] took place during Lent, when the company lay idle; not until the hastily added epilogue to ''Nine Days' Wonder'' (his account of the stunt) does he refer to his plan to return to individual performances. He may have had a hand in the [[bad quarto]]s of ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[The London Prodigal]]'', in which the clown parts are unusually accurate.\n\nWhatever the reason for his departure, Kempe was replaced by [[Robert Armin]], formerly of [[Chandos's Men]] and an author in his own right. Small and fanciful, Armin offered significantly different options for Shakespeare, and the change is seen in the last Elizabethan and first Jacobean plays. Armin is generally credited with originating such characters as Feste in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', Touchstone in ''[[As You Like It]]'', and the fool in ''King Lear''.\n\nThus, by 1603 the core of the troupe was in some respects younger than it had been in 1594. Bryan, Pope, and Kempe, veterans of the 1580s, had left, and the remaining sharers (with the probable exception of Phillips), were roughly within a decade of 40.\n\n==Repertory and performances==\nShakespeare's work undoubtedly formed the great bulk of the company's repertory. In their first year of performance, they may have staged such of Shakespeare's older plays as remained in the author's possession, including ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', as well as ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''. ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' may have been the first play Shakespeare wrote for the new company; it was followed over the next two years by a concentrated burst of creativity that resulted in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and the plays in the so-called second [[tetralogy]]. The extent and nature of the non-Shakespearean repertory in the first is not known; plays such as ''[[Locrine]]'', ''[[The Troublesome Reign of King John]]'', and [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' have somewhat cautiously been advanced as likely candidates. The earliest non-Shakespearean play known to have been performed by the company is [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'', which was produced in the middle of 1598; they also staged the thematic sequel, ''[[Every Man Out of His Humour]]'', the next year.\n\nOn the strength of these plays, the company quickly rivalled Alleyn's troupe for preeminence in London; as early as 1595 they gave four performances at court, followed by six the next year and four in 1597. These years were, typically for an Elizabethan company, also fraught with uncertainty. The company suffered along with the others in the summer of 1597, when the uproar over ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]'' temporarily closed the theatres; records from [[Dover]] and [[Bristol]] indicate that at least some of the company toured that summer. The character of [[Falstaff]], though immensely popular from the start, aroused the ire of [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]], who objected to the use of the character's original name (Oldcastle), which derived from a member of Cobham's family.\n\nIn the last years of the century, the company continued to stage Shakespeare's new plays, including ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', which may have opened the Globe, and ''[[Hamlet]]'', which may well have appeared first at the Curtain. Among non-Shakespearean drama, ''A Warning for Fair Women'' was certainly performed, as was the Tudor history ''[[Thomas Lord Cromwell]]'', sometimes seen as a salvo in a theatrical feud with the Admiral's Men, whose lost plays on [[Thomas Wolsey|Wolsey]] date from the same year.\n\nIn 1601, in addition to their tangential involvement with the Essex rebellion, the company played a role in a less serious conflict, the so-called [[War of the Theatres]]. They produced [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''Satiromastix'', a satire on Ben Jonson that seems to have ended the dispute. Somewhat uncharacteristically, Jonson does not appear to have held a grudge against the company; in 1603, they staged his ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus]]'', with dissatisfying results. They also performed ''[[The London Prodigal]]'', ''[[The Merry Devil of Edmonton]]'', and ''The Fair Maid of Bristow'', the last a rarity in that it is a Chamberlain's play that has never been attributed in any part to Shakespeare.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain's Men, and its individual members, largely avoided the scandals and turbulence in which other companies and actors sometimes involved themselves. Their most serious difficulty with the government came about as a result of their tangential involvement in the February 1601 insurrection of the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. Some of Essex's supporters had commissioned a special performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' in the hope that the spectacle of that king's overthrow might make the public more amenable to the overthrow of Elizabeth (who later remarked, \"I am Richard II, know ye not that?\"). Augustine Phillips was deposed on the matter by the investigating authorities; he testified that the actors had been offered 40 shillings more than their usual fee, and for that reason alone had performed the play on 7 February, the day before Essex's uprising.<ref name=\"bate256\">{{cite book|last=Bate|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Bate|title=Soul of the Age|publisher=Penguin|location=London|date=2008|pages=256\u201386|isbn=978-0-670-91482-1}}</ref> The explanation was accepted; the company and its members went unpunished, and even performed for Elizabeth at [[Whitehall]] on 24 February, the day before Essex's execution.\n\nThe following year, 1602, saw [[Christopher Beeston]]'s rape charge.

[[Richard Burbage]] played most of the lead roles, including [[Hamlet]], [[Othello]], [[King Lear]], and [[Macbeth]]. Formed at the end of a period of flux in the theatrical world of London, it had become, by 1603, one of the two leading companies of the city and was subsequently patronized by [[James I of England|James I]].\n\nIt was founded during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth the first of England]] in 1594 under the [[patronage]] of [[Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon]], then the [[Lord Chamberlain]], who was in charge of court entertainments. After Carey's death on 23 July 1596, the company came under the patronage of his son, [[George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon]], for whom it was briefly known as '''Lord Hunsdon's Men'''.  When George Carey in turn became Lord Chamberlain on 17 March 1597, it reverted to its previous name. The company became the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] in 1603 when [[James I of England|King James]] ascended the throne and became the companys patron. The company held exclusive rights to perform Shakespeare's plays.\n\n==Playhouses==\n[[Image:The Old Globe.jpg|thumb|right|Print, based on Hollar's 1644 Long View of London, of the 1614 second [[Globe Theatre]]]]\nFrom 1594 the players performed at [[The Theatre]], in [[Shoreditch]]. Problems with the landlord caused the company to move to the nearby [[Curtain Theatre]] in 1597. On the night of 29 December 1598, The Theatre was dismantled by the Burbage brothers, along with William Smith, their financial backer, [[Peter Street (carpenter)|Peter Street]], a carpenter, and ten to twelve workmen. The beams were then carried south of the river to [[Southwark]] to form part of their new playhouse, the [[Globe Theatre]]. Built in 1599, this theatre was destroyed in a fire on 29 June 1613. The Globe was rebuilt by June 1614 and finally closed in 1642. The company also toured Britain, and visited France and Belgium.\n\nA modern reconstruction of the original Globe, named \"[[Shakespeare's Globe]]\", opened in 1997 near the site of the original theatre.\n\n==Personnel==\n{{main|King's Men personnel}}\nThe initial form of the Chamberlain's men arose largely from the departure of [[Edward Alleyn]] from [[Lord Strange's Men]] and the subsequent death of [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby|Lord Strange]] himself, in the spring of 1594. Yet the ultimate success of the company was largely determined by the Burbage family. [[James Burbage]] was the impresario who assembled the company and directed its activities until his death in 1597; his sons Richard and [[Cuthbert Burbage|Cuthbert]] were members of the company, though Cuthbert did not act. This connection with the Burbages makes the Chamberlain's Men the central link in a chain that extends from the beginning of professional theatre (in 1574, James Burbage led the first group of actors to be protected under the 1572 statute against rogues and vagabonds) in Renaissance London to its end. In 1642, the King's Men were among the acting companies whose activities were ended by [[Parliament's prohibition of the stage]].)\n\nThe Chamberlain's Men comprised a core of eight \"sharers\", who split profits and debts; perhaps an equal number of hired men who acted minor and doubled parts; and a slightly smaller number of [[boy player]]s, who were sometimes bound apprentices to an adult actor. The original sharers in the Chamberlain's were eight. Probably the most famous in the 1590's to the 1600's was [[William Kempe]], who had been in the company of the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]] in the 1580s, and had later joined the King's Men. As the company's clown, he presumably took the broadest comic role in every play; he is identified with Peter in the [[book size|quarto]] of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and probably also originated Dogberry in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and Bottom in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. Kempe has traditionally been viewed as the object of Hamlet's complaint about extemporising clowns; whether this association is right or wrong, Kempe had left the company by 1601. Another two sharers from Strange's Men had a long-standing association with Kempe. [[George Bryan (16th-century actor)|George Bryan]] had been in Leicester's Men in the 1580s, and at [[Elsinore]] with Kempe in 1586; because he is not mentioned in later Chamberlain's or King's Men documents, it is assumed that Bryan retired from the stage in 1597 or 1598. (Bryan lived on for some years; in the reign of [[King James I of England|James]], he is listed as a [[Groom of the Chamber]], with household duties, as late as 1613.) [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], another Leicester's veteran, retired in 1600 and died in 1603. Both Bryan and Pope came to the company from Lord Strange's Men.\n[[Augustine Phillips]] also came from Strange's Men. He remained with the troupe until his death in 1605.\n[[Image:St Leonards Memorial.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial to Tudor actors buried in [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch|Shoreditch church]] \u2013 including [[James Burbage]] and his sons, [[Richard Burbage]] and [[Cuthbert Burbage]], among others]]\nTwo younger actors who came from Strange's, [[Henry Condell]] and [[John Heminges]], are most famous now for collecting and editing the plays of Shakespeare's [[First Folio]] (1623).

He worked hard to win the custom of the local farmers and also became involved in the local community playing sport and being elected as a Councillor at 23. He married Edna, a St Walburg girl and after 7 years in 1969, they moved to Edmonton.<ref name=\"Group\" />\n\nOver the next thirteen years he pursued various business and career opportunities. He was the commission bulk agent for Esso in Edmonton from 1972 through 1981, and served as Chairman of the Esso Agents Prairie Region Advisory Board. During his tenure, this became the largest Esso Agency in Canada. In 1983, anticipating the de-regulation of the crude oil and natural gas markets, Nichols and two associates founded Northridge Canada Inc. which became Canada's largest privately held crude oil and natural gas trading company. Northridge was ultimately sold to [[TC PipeLines|TransCanada Pipelines]]. In 1985, he created Gasland Oil, with its head office in Edmonton. Gasland grew to have over 50 branded petroleum outlets in Western Canada, many with convenience stores and other customer facilities. He sold substantially all of Gasland's petroleum marketing business in 1996 to [[Husky Energy]], but retained Gasland Properties Ltd., he has therefore shifted his focus to developing that company's various holdings.<ref name=\"Group\" />\n\nIn May 2002, he was inducted into the Alberta Business Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gasland.com/cal-nichols.php|title=Profile of Cal Nichols, C.M.|last=|first=|date=|website=Gasland Properties Ltd|publisher=|access-date=14 October 2016}}</ref>  He was awarded the Queens Golden Julnilee Medal  <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=4150&t=6&ln=Nichols|title=Golden Jubilee Medal|last=|first=|date=|website=The Governor General of Canada|publisher=|access-date=14 October 2016}}</ref> created in 2002 to commemorate the 50th anniversary to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to the throne and awarded to persons who had made outstanding contributions to both their own community and to Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.gg.ca/honours/medals/hon04-qegj_e.asp|title=Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal|last=|first=|date=|website=Honours|publisher=|access-date=14 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, he was named to the [[Order of Canada]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/nichols-bandura-named-to-the-order-of-canada|title=Nichols, Bandura named to the Order of Canada 28 December 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=Edmonton Journal|publisher=|access-date=10 October 2016}}</ref> which was established in 1967 to acknowledge citizens who have \"...{{nbsp}}outstanding achievement, dedication to the community and service to the nation.\"  He was appointed a Member (C.M.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=15922|title=Order of Canada Appointments 26 December 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=The Governor General of Canada|publisher=|access-date=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nNicols summed up his own life view as [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]]\n\n<blockquote>I believe in being rewarded for superior effort, harder work, ... you should benefit from that, but in the process of benefiting, you should never forget where you came from, and how can I use my good fortune to help those who are less fortunate.

The Oilers were owned [[Peter Pocklington]], who decisions regarding the team had disillusioned fans including a threat to move the team to the United States. In 1994 in return for taxpayer funds being used to refurbish the home ground [[Peter Pocklington|Pocklington]] had agreed that local buyers would be given the right to purchase the team for cnd$100 before he could sell it to an American buyer.  The [[Edmonton Oilers|Oilers]] were in financial difficulties but could receive league assistance if they could sell 13,000 seasons tickets and 90 percent of corporate boxes. In 1996, Nichols co-chaired the Friends of the Oilers (FOTO) ticket drive campaign and mainly through his efforts the 13,000 season tickets deadline was reached.  In 1997, when the franchise was put up for sale, he  spearheaded the bid from a local ownership group EIG made up of 37/38 investors by co-ordinating raising the $60 million in equity required to purchase the team.
