{"title_page": "Hindu mythological wars", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2015}}\n'''Ancient Hindu wars''' are the [[battle]]s described in the [[Hindu texts]] of ancient [[India]]. These battles depicted great [[hero]]es, [[demon]]s, celestial weapons and [[supernatural]] beings. Major wars were fought with the aim of upholding the ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness that brought [[prosperity]] to [[human]]ity) over ''[[Adharma]]'' (wickedness that causes humanity to suffer). The purpose of the wars is often described as the removal of demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursued war with ambition (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted. But, when this time comes, war is taught to be a matter of great personal and social importance, where every man who belongs to the warrior caste must do his duty, exemplifying courage, [[honor]], and fearsome prowess against all odds and even at the cost of his life.\n\nThe major Hindu gods, including [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], often engage in war, either in the form of [[Avatars]] or in their true form. They and many Hindu heroes use ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' \u2013 celestial weapons with fearsome supernatural power \u2013 to aid them in battle.\n\n[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|375px|The Battle of Kurukshetra, fought between the [[Kaurava]]s and the [[Pandava]]s, recorded in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.]]\n\u0905\u0924\u0940\u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0925\u0940 - \u092a\u0930\u0936\u0941\u0930\u093e\u092e, \u092e\u0947\u0918\u0928\u093e\u0926 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902\u0915\u093f \u092f\u0947 \u0968 \u092f\u094b\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u091c\u094b \u092c\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924 , \u0928\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0923 \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930, \u092a\u0936\u0941\u092a\u0924\u093f \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u091a\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0924\u0947 \u0925\u0947/\n\u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0925\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902\u0915\u093f \u0935\u094b \u0928\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0923 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923 \u0905\u0935\u0924\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u0948 \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0939\u094b\u0902\u0928\u0947 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928 \u0936\u093f\u0935, \u0917\u0923\u0947\u0936, \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u0947\u092f \u0915\u094b \u092d\u0940 \u092f\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948 /\n\n==In Vedic literature==\n\n===Indra and Vritra===\nThe central battle in the ''Vedas'' is between [[Indra]] and [[Vritra]], and the defeat of the demon Vritra leads to the liberation of rivers, cattle and ''[[Ushas]]'' ([[dawn]]/light). While this battle does reinforce the timeless good v/s evil theme, close examination of various hymns and verses in the [[Rigveda]] suggest this might have been an allegorical account of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system.<ref>[http://rigvedaanalysis.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/vrtra-myth-the-bharadvaja-version/ A record of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system?]</ref>\n\nAnother important battle is the historic [[Battle of the Ten Kings]], alluded to in the [[Rigveda]], in which the [[Tritsu]] clan, led by [[Sudas]], defeat the [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Puru]] confederation of ten [[Indo Aryan]] clans.<ref name=\"schmidt1980\">Schmidt, H.P.

Both races are technically equal, possessors of great religious and martial powers, but the Devas are committed to the worship of the [[Supreme Being]] and the practice of [[virtue]]. The Asuras have atheistic and devious tendencies that grow over time.

The king whose authority is contested must prove himself in battle or accept the imperial supremacy of the challenging king. When the horse returns safely after the period of time, the main sacrifice is performed, and the king, if successful in obtaining dominance over other kings, is crowned ''Emperor of the World''. The ''Ashwamedha'' allows the opportunity to maintain peace if the kings do not choose to contest the sacrificial horse. In the [[Mahabharata|Mahabharat]] era, [[Arjuna]] alone had conquered the whole world for the sake of ''Ashwamedha Yagya'' of his brother.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m14/m14085.htm|title=Digivijaya of Arjuna}}</ref>\n*''[[Rajasuya]]'': Considered the ultimate sacrifice, the king performing the sacrifice must openly challenge every king in the world to accept his supremacy or defeat him in battle. If and when the king returns successfully, having beaten all other known rulers, the performance of the sacrifice will send him to the abode of [[Indra]]. It was performed by king [[Yudhishthira]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' epic.

Rama was extremely powerful warrior and had knowledge of usage of many celestial astras. Rama single-handedly slayed the 14,000 demon hordes of [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] (in one hour, according to the ''Ramayana''), the demons [[Maricha]] and [[Subahu]], Ravana's chief commander [[Prahasta]] and is responsible for the ultimate killing of [[Ravana]] himself.\n*[[Lakshmana]] : He was also very powerful like his brother. He was incarnation of Sheshnag. He controlled his sleep for 14 continuous years and slayed extremely powerful demons including [[Atikaya]] and [[Indrajit]].\n*[[Hanuman]] : He was son of Kesari and Anjana. He was one of the [[Rudras]] of Shiva. He was first trained by Sun god Surya and later Shiva himself mentored him. Later he became [[Vanara]] minister of [[Sugriva]]. He is the greatest devotee of [[Rama]], famous for his unerring service, absolute loyalty and great feats of courage. Hanuman is responsible for killing many demons, as well as burning the city of Lanka. His strength is given by his father [[Vayu]], and by virtue of the boons bestowed on him by various Gods, no astra & weapon could harm him. He can transform into any size & shape as he desired. He was also well expert in using celestial astras. He also possessed Mohini astra, Raudra astra etc. \n*[[Ravana]]: blessed by his fearsome 10,000 year [[tapasya]] to be the most powerful being on earth, invulnerable to every God, demon and living being, save man. Although an expert on the [[Vedas]], a great king, and a great devotee of [[Shiva]], he is the Emperor of evil due to his patronage of demons, murder of kings and humiliation of the Gods headed by Indra.\n*[[Indrajit]] : He was first-born son of mighty [[Ravana]]. Originally his name was Meghanada. He was master of illusion war techniques. He became the possessor of several supreme celestial weapons. Through penance, he obtained a boon from Brahma : he could be killed by a common man who could control his sleep for 12 years continuously. He defeated [[Indra]] and arrested him. Then Brahma appeared and asked him to free Indra. Meghanada did as Brahma directed and was then granted boon : he would never be killed in any battle, until his Yagna (fire-worship) of his native goddess Nikumbala was disturbed and destroyed. On the completion of the Yagna, a supreme celestial chariot would appear, boarding which, Indrajit would become unkilled in any battle. But Brahma also cautioned him that whosoever would destroy this yagna, would also kill him. He was killed by [[Lakshmana]].\n*[[Kumbhakarna]]: the gigantic brother of Ravana is a fearsome monster-demon who sleeps for six months at a stretch, rising for only one day and then returning to his slumber. Kumbhakarna can slay hundreds of warriors by the sweep of his hand or step of his foot.

He performed incredible feats like defeating Gandharva King Chitrasena and Nivatakavachas (whom Ravana and Indrajit combinely failed to defeat and made truce). Arjuna is the only invincible warrior on the Earth. It is said that only Mahadeva (Lord Shiva) had ability to beat Arjuna in battle.\n*[[Ashwatthama]]:the son of [[Drona]], one of the eight [[chiranjivi|chiranjeevi]]s . He is a great warrior. [[Aswatthama|Ashwathama]] and [[Kripa]] are believed to be the lone survivors still living who actually fought in the Kurukshetra war.

He was known to be an aggressive warrior. He was brutally killed by [[Bhima]].\n*[[Bhishma]]: the most consummate warrior trained by [[Parashurama]], Bhishma is indestructible by any warrior (except Lord Parshuram, Lord Krishna, Lord Balrama, Arjuna and Abhimanyu).

In the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]], he is called Paramatman or Parameshwara (the highest form of God), and is periodically reborn as an [[Avatar]] upon earth in order to destroy evil and bring deliverance to the pious. He is also the refuge of the Devas in their battles against Asuras. The most martial Avatars include [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], [[Mohini]], [[Vamana]], [[Parshurama|Parshuram]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Kalki]]. He is also considered to be the first God, 'Adideva'. He is beyond birth, death, time. He is beyond all. In battle, the avatars of Vishnu are aided by a variety of ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' or celestial weapons. His two human avatars, Parashuram and Rama, were fearsome warriors and possessed many celestial weapons that accompany the past times of Vishnu. Krishna also used a few of these weapons in Mahabharata. These include:\n\n*''[[Kaumodaki]]'': The divine [[Gada (mace)|mace]] weapon of Vishnu; invincible and without parallel; Krishna slayed demon Dantavakra with it.\n*''Kodandam'': The bow of [[Rama]], 7th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Nandaka]]'': The sword of Vishnu\n*''[[Narayanastra]]'': Narayanastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Vaishnavastra. The personal missile weapon of Vishnu in his [[Narayana]] (Naraina) form, this ''astra'' lets loose a powerful tirade of millions of deadly missiles simultaneously. The intensity of the shower increases with resistance. The only solution is total submission before the missile; only then will it cease. The Narayanastra was first used by Rama in the ''Ramayana''. Then, thousands of years later, this astra was again used by [[Ashwatthama|Ashwathama]] in the [[Kurukshetra War]] against the [[Pandava]] army.\n*''[[Parashu]]'': The axe of [[Parashurama]], 6th avatar of [[Vishnu]], given by [[Shiva]].\n*''[[Sharanga (Hindu mythology)|Sharanga]]'': The celestial bow of Vishnu. \n*''Sharkha'': The bow of [[Krishna]], 8th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Sudarshana Chakra]]'': The magical ''Chakra'', a spinning disc with sharp outer spears. It is the most powerful Shastra in the universe, and without any parallel. The Chakra was famously designed by Vishwakarma for Vishnu. The Sudarshan flies at the command of Krishna, spinning away to tear off the heads of his opponents, or to perform any function desired by Vishnu. It was most famously used by [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n*''[[Vaishnavastra]]'': Vaishnavastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Narayanastra. The personal missile weapon of [[Krishna]], once fired it cannot be thwarted by any means, save by the will of [[Vishnu]] himself. [[Krishna]] gave this astra to his cousin [[Arjuna]].\n[[File:Shiva as the Lord of Dance LACMA.jpg|thumb|250px|11th-century statue of Shiva performing the dance of destruction.]]\n\n===Shiva===\n{{Main|Shiva}}\nMahadeva literally means \"Highest of all gods\".

He is the spouse of [[Shakti]]. He also is represented by Mahakala and Bhairava. Shiva is often pictured holding the [[damaru]], an hourglass-shaped drum, along with his [[trishula]], a [[trident]]-staff. His usual [[mantra]] is [[Om Namah Shivaya|''Om Namah Shivaya'']].<ref>Elizabeth Gilbert (2007). Eat, Pray, Love, p. 133.</ref>  Shiva is also considered as the God Of Gods.

Assigned with destroying all of the universe at the end of time, Shiva is one of the most fearsome warriors and unconquerable. [[Tandava]] is the dance of the destroyer, which he performs over the body of a demon. Shiva employs his power to kill the [[Asura]] Tripura, destroying the flying three cities of Tripura. In battle, Shiva and his Avatars deploy formidable weapons controlled by him. Some of these are:\n\n*''Arrow of Shiva'': It can destroy creation. Returns to the quiver after being used.\n*''[[Chandrahas]]'': Sword of [[Ravana]] granted by [[Shiva]] as a boon.\n*''Ekasha Gada'': The mace of [[Shiva]].

Modern speculation has equated its destructive nature to be similar to that of a [[nuclear weapon]], it has been used multiple times in Ramayana, Indrajit used it against Hanuman, Lakshmana asked permission to use it against Indrajit, which Rama declined, Lakshmana used it to kill Atikaya,  Rama used it as final arrow to kill Ravana. In the epic Mahabharata, it is said that the weapon manifest with the single head of Brahma as its tip.

It is thought that the Brahmashirsha is the evolution of the Brahmastra, 4 times stronger than Brahmastra. \"It blazes up with terrible flames within a huge sphere of fire. Numerous peals of thunder were heard, thousands of meteors fell and all living creatures became terrified with great dread.

In some texts it is called Brahma-dhanda astra, the weapon created by [[Saptarishi]]'s to counter any weapon ever created, even that of [[Trimurti]]'s. The rishi of this weapon is [[Para Brahman]]. It is said to be the most difficult astra to obtain. Capable of destroying entire universe in a blink of an eye. [[Vishvamitra]] used all kinds of divine weapons against sage [[Vashistha]], even [[Pashupatastra]], but the Brahma-dhanda astra of [[Vashistha]] neutralized and swallowed all [[astra (weapon)]] of Vishwamitra proving that Brahma-dhanda astra is the most powerful of all astras.<ref name=\"Bala Khanda Sarga 56\">{{cite web | url=http://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1093926-bala-kanda-sarga-56/ | title=Brahmadhanda astra | accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>\n*''[[Pashupatastra]]'': In Hinduism, it is believed that Pashupatastra is the most devastating weapon, as it is the weapon of the consort of the God head Mahadeva, i.e. Mahakali.

These battles depicted great [[hero]]es, [[demon]]s, celestial weapons and [[supernatural]] beings. Major wars were fought with the aim of upholding the ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness that brought [[prosperity]] to [[human]]ity) over ''[[Adharma]]'' (wickedness that causes humanity to suffer). The purpose of the wars is often described as the removal of demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursued war with ambition (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted. But, when this time comes, war is taught to be a matter of great personal and social importance, where every man who belongs to the warrior caste must do his duty, exemplifying courage, [[honor]], and fearsome prowess against all odds and even at the cost of his life.\n\nThe major Hindu gods, including [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], often engage in war, either in the form of [[Avatars]] or in their true form.

When the horse returns safely after the period of time, the main sacrifice is performed, and the king, if successful in obtaining dominance over other kings, is crowned ''Emperor of the World''. The ''Ashwamedha'' allows the opportunity to maintain peace if the kings do not choose to contest the sacrificial horse.

In the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]], he is called Paramatman or Parameshwara (the highest form of God), and is periodically reborn as an [[Avatar]] upon earth in order to destroy evil and bring deliverance to the pious. He is also the refuge of the Devas in their battles against Asuras. The most martial Avatars include [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], [[Mohini]], [[Vamana]], [[Parshurama|Parshuram]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Kalki]]. He is also considered to be the first God, 'Adideva'. He is beyond birth, death, time. He is beyond all. In battle, the avatars of Vishnu are aided by a variety of ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' or celestial weapons. His two human avatars, Parashuram and Rama, were fearsome warriors and possessed many celestial weapons that accompany the past times of Vishnu. Krishna also used a few of these weapons in Mahabharata. These include:\n\n*''[[Kaumodaki]]'': The divine [[Gada (mace)|mace]] weapon of Vishnu; invincible and without parallel; Krishna slayed demon Dantavakra with it.\n*''Kodandam'': The bow of [[Rama]], 7th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Nandaka]]'': The sword of Vishnu\n*''[[Narayanastra]]'': Narayanastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Vaishnavastra. The personal missile weapon of Vishnu in his [[Narayana]] (Naraina) form, this ''astra'' lets loose a powerful tirade of millions of deadly missiles simultaneously. The intensity of the shower increases with resistance. The only solution is total submission before the missile; only then will it cease. The Narayanastra was first used by Rama in the ''Ramayana''. Then, thousands of years later, this astra was again used by [[Ashwatthama|Ashwathama]] in the [[Kurukshetra War]] against the [[Pandava]] army.\n*''[[Parashu]]'': The axe of [[Parashurama]], 6th avatar of [[Vishnu]], given by [[Shiva]].\n*''[[Sharanga (Hindu mythology)|Sharanga]]'': The celestial bow of Vishnu. \n*''Sharkha'': The bow of [[Krishna]], 8th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Sudarshana Chakra]]'': The magical ''Chakra'', a spinning disc with sharp outer spears. It is the most powerful Shastra in the universe, and without any parallel. The Chakra was famously designed by Vishwakarma for Vishnu. The Sudarshan flies at the command of Krishna, spinning away to tear off the heads of his opponents, or to perform any function desired by Vishnu. It was most famously used by [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n*''[[Vaishnavastra]]'': Vaishnavastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Narayanastra. The personal missile weapon of [[Krishna]], once fired it cannot be thwarted by any means, save by the will of [[Vishnu]] himself.

[[Tandava]] is the dance of the destroyer, which he performs over the body of a demon. Shiva employs his power to kill the [[Asura]] Tripura, destroying the flying three cities of Tripura.

She holds the trident of Shiva, the ''Chakra'' of Vishnu, the ''Vajra'' of Indra, the ''Gada'' of Yamaraj.\n\n==Celestial Weapons==\n{{citations needed|date=March 2020}}\nAn ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' is a weapon that is to be hurled at an enemy. Examples include arrows from bows. A ''[[shastra]]'' is a personal weapon, like swords and maces, that must be constantly operated by the warrior.\n\n*''[[Brahmastra]]'': Embedded with the mystical force of [[Brahma]], this weapon releases millions of missiles, great fires and a destructive potential capable of extinguishing all creation, if not used by and aimed only at a celestial fighter. Modern speculation has equated its destructive nature to be similar to that of a [[nuclear weapon]], it has been used multiple times in Ramayana, Indrajit used it against Hanuman, Lakshmana asked permission to use it against Indrajit, which Rama declined, Lakshmana used it to kill Atikaya,  Rama used it as final arrow to kill Ravana. In the epic Mahabharata, it is said that the weapon manifest with the single head of Brahma as its tip. In Mahabharata era Parasurama, Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Kripa, Ashwatthama, Arjuna, Yudhishtir and several Maharathi's possessed the knowledge to invoke this weapon.\n*''[[Brahmashirsha astra]]'': A weapon capable of greater destruction than the ''Brahmastra''. It can burn all creation to ashes once discharged, Arjuna and Ashwathama both used it against each other after the Mahabharata war. Capable of killing even heavens. Was used by Ashwatthama on Parikshit. It is thought that the Brahmashirsha is the evolution of the Brahmastra, 4 times stronger than Brahmastra. \"It blazes up with terrible flames within a huge sphere of fire. Numerous peals of thunder were heard, thousands of meteors fell and all living creatures became terrified with great dread. The entire sky seemed to be filled with noise and assumed a terrible aspect with flames of fire. The whole earth with her mountains and waters and trees trembled.\" When it strikes an area it will cause complete destruction and nothing will ever grow, not even a blade of grass for the next 12 years. It will not rain for 12 years in that area and everything including metal and earth becomes poisoned.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m10/m10012.htm www.sacred-texts.com]</ref> In the epic Mahabharata, it is said that the weapon manifest with the four heads of Brahma as its tip.In Mahabharata era sage Agnivesha, Drona, Ashwatthama, Arjuna possessed the knowledge to invoke this weapon.\n*''[[Brahmanda astra]]'': This is the most powerful weapon of Brahma. It was first used by sage Vashishtha against vishwamitra's (who was King Vishwarath at that time) Brahmashirsha, as only Brahmanda astra can stop Brahmashirsha astra, it was also used by sage Piplad against [[Shani]] to avenge his father's death.In the epic Mahabharata, it is said that the weapon manifest with the all five heads of Brahma as its tip.Brahma earlier lost his fifth head when he fought with Siva.This weapon is said to possess the power to destroy entire solar system or brahmand, the 14 realms according to Hindu cosmology. In some texts it is called Brahma-dhanda astra, the weapon created by [[Saptarishi]]'s to counter any weapon ever created, even that of [[Trimurti]]'s. The rishi of this weapon is [[Para Brahman]]. It is said to be the most difficult astra to obtain. Capable of destroying entire universe in a blink of an eye. [[Vishvamitra]] used all kinds of divine weapons against sage [[Vashistha]], even [[Pashupatastra]], but the Brahma-dhanda astra of [[Vashistha]] neutralized and swallowed all [[astra (weapon)]] of Vishwamitra proving that Brahma-dhanda astra is the most powerful of all astras.<ref name=\"Bala Khanda Sarga 56\">{{cite web | url=http://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1093926-bala-kanda-sarga-56/ | title=Brahmadhanda astra | accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>\n*''[[Pashupatastra]]'': In Hinduism, it is believed that Pashupatastra is the most devastating weapon, as it is the weapon of the consort of the God head Mahadeva, i.e. Mahakali. Mahadeva literally means \"Highest of all gods\" and Mahakali means \"Goddess who is beyond time\". This weapon was granted to [[Arjuna]] by Shiva. It is the most destructive and foreboding weapon in ''Mahabharata''. It was first used by Shiva for the destruction of tripura.  It is capable of destroying entire multiverse. In Ramayana, [[Vishvamitra]] possessed this mighty weapon. In Mahabharat era, Apart from Arjuna no one possessed this weapon.\n*''[[Narayanastra]]'': Invincible and painful, this ''astra'' is unconquerable except by total submission, this astra was used by Krishna against Shiva, when Shiva was fighting on behalf of the evil Banasura, when shiva charged his personal Pashupatastra on Krishna, Krishna used this to make Shiva fall asleep, allowing him to move past him and cut off Banasura's arms but at the request of Shiva does not kill Banasura.\n*''[[Vaishnavastra]] '' : One of the most powerful astras, this cannot be stopped by anyone except its creator, [[Vishnu]]. Vaishnavastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Narayanastra. The personal missile weapon of [[Krishna]], once fired it cannot be thwarted by any means, save by the will of [[Vishnu]] Himself. [[Krishna]] gave this astra to his cousin [[Arjuna]]. Rama, Krishna, Arjuna possessed this weapon.\n[[File:Shiva as the Lord of Dance LACMA.jpg|thumb|250px|11th-century statue of Shiva performing the dance of destruction.]]\n*''Nagastra'': The snake weapon used by Indrajit against Rama and Lakshmana, used by [[Karna]] against Arjuna.\n*''Nagapasham'': is the celestial weapon equal to ''Nagastra\".\n*''Garudastra'':The eagle weapon to counter against the ''Nagastra''.\n*''[[Anjalikastra]]'': The personal weapon of [[Indra]].

Indra granted it to [[Karna]] during the [[Mahabharata#The battle at Kurukshetra|Kurukshetra war]], in Mahabharata it was used by karna to kill Ghatotkacha.\n*''[[Vajra]]'': The thunderbolt weapon of [[Indra]], who is the God of thunder and lightning, akin to [[Zeus]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].,<ref>Sarat Chandra Das (1902), A Tibetan-English dictionary with Sanskrit synonyms, Bengal Secretariat Book Dep\u00f4t</ref> this weapon was made from the bones of sage [[dadhichi]] and it was used by Indra to slay demon called Vritra. Later, Indra gave his Vajra to his son Arjuna. Apart from Indra, only [[Arjuna]] possessed it.\n*''Agneyastra'': The fire weapon, created by [[Agni]], master of the flames\n*''[[Varunastra]]'': The water weapon, created by [[Varuna]], master of the oceans\n*''Vayavastra'': The wind weapon, created by [[Vayu]]\n*''Samvarta'': Weapon belonging to [[Yama]] used by [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] to annihilate thirty million gandharvas in a moment, tearing them to pieces.\n*''Sammohanastra'': Would cause entire hosts/armies to collapse in a trance. It was used by Arjuna to collapse the entire army of Kuru Maharathis including Duryodhan, Drona, Kripa, Ashwatthama, Dushasan, and Karna.\n*''Twashtastra'': When used against a group of opponents (such as an army), would cause them to mistake each other for enemies and fight each other.\n*''Sooryastra'': Create a dazzling light that would dispel any darkness about and dry up water bodies.\n*''Sabda vedastra'': This weapon prevents an opponent from turning invisible. Used by Arjuna against the Gandharva king Chitrasena.\n*''Gandharvastra'': Created by Gandharva King Chitrasena (who defeated the combined force of Duryodhan and made Karna flee the battlefield). He gave it to Arjuna.\n*''Mayastra'': Dispel any form of maya or sorcery in the vicinity. It was possessed by [[Arjuna]].\n*''Manavastra'': Created by Manu, it could overcome supernatural protections and carry the target hundreds of miles away. Can inspire humane traits in an evil being. This weapon was used by Rama on Maricha.\n*''Bhaumastra'': Created by Goddess Bhumi Devi, the weapon could create tunnels deep into the earth and summon jewels.\n*''Indrastra'': Created by the God Indra, it would bring about a 'shower' of arrows from the sky.\n\nThe three potential astras are Vaishnavastra, Pashupatastra and Brahmanda astra. However, these astras cannot harm four principle gods i.e. [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], and [[Devi]] as they are the supreme manifestation of the divine.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{HinduMythology}}\n\n[[Category:War in mythology]]\n[[Category:Hindu mythology|Wars]]\n[[Category:Hinduism and violence|Mythological wars]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4043:51e:8905:dbab:dd08:c00b:cd37", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_mythological_wars"}

It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[shooter game|shooter]]-[[survival game]] for up to four players to fight off [[zombie]]-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a free-to-play [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. The first two-game modes were released in 2017 as [[early access]] titles and ''Creative'' was released on December 6, 2018. ''Save the World'' is available only for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], while ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' released for those platforms, in addition for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.\n\nWhile the first two games have been successful for Epic Games, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' became a resounding success \u2013 drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming a [[cultural phenomenon]].\n\n==Game modes==\nCurrently, ''Fortnite'' is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine and has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.\n\n* ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'' is designed as player-versus-environment game, with four players cooperating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like \"husks\". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that help to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.\n* ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' is a player-versus-player battle royale game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players [[skydive|airdrop]] from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and attack other players, eliminating them. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.\n* ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' is a sandbox game mode, similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' in that players are given complete freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges and more. \n\nIn the first two modes, players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within ''Save the World'' this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In ''Battle Royale'', this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe.  Players are encouraged to be very inventive in designing their fortifications in ''Creative''.\n\nAll game modes are set to be free-to-play titles, although as of 2019, ''Save the World'' is in early access and requires purchase to play.<ref>{{cite news | title=Fortnite Save the World Is 50 Percent Off During Fortnite Lunar New Year Sale 2019 | last1=Alwani | first1=Rishi | publisher=Gadgets360 | date=February 5, 2019 | url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-save-the-world-is-50-percent-off-during-fortnite-lunar-new-year-sale-2019-1988900 }}</ref> The first two games are [[video game monetization|monetized]] through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in ''Save the World''.

Further, Epic was looking to get into the [[games as a service]] model, and brought in Chinese publisher [[Tencent]] to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the departure of several executives, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]], who had been a key part of ''Fortnite''{{'}}s development.

It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[shooter game|shooter]]-[[survival game]] for up to four players to fight off [[zombie]]-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a free-to-play [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. The first two-game modes were released in 2017 as [[early access]] titles and ''Creative'' was released on December 6, 2018. ''Save the World'' is available only for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], while ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' released for those platforms, in addition for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.\n\nWhile the first two games have been successful for Epic Games, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' became a resounding success \u2013 drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming a [[cultural phenomenon]].\n\n==Game modes==\nCurrently, ''Fortnite'' is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine and has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.\n\n* ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'' is designed as player-versus-environment game, with four players cooperating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like \"husks\". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that help to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.\n* ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' is a player-versus-player battle royale game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players [[skydive|airdrop]] from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and attack other players, eliminating them. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.\n* ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' is a sandbox game mode, similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' in that players are given complete freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges and more. \n\nIn the first two modes, players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within ''Save the World'' this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In ''Battle Royale'', this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe.  Players are encouraged to be very creative in designing their fortifications in ''Creative''.\n\nAll game modes are set to be free-to-play titles, although as of 2019, ''Save the World'' is in early access and requires purchase to play.<ref>{{cite news | title=Fortnite Save the World Is 50 Percent Off During Fortnite Lunar New Year Sale 2019 | last1=Alwani | first1=Rishi | publisher=Gadgets360 | date=February 5, 2019 | url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-save-the-world-is-50-percent-off-during-fortnite-lunar-new-year-sale-2019-1988900 }}</ref> The first two games are [[video game monetization|monetized]] through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in ''Save the World''.
