She moved to [[Los Angeles]] the following year to venture into [[Secularity|secular]] music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers [[Glen Ballard]], [[Dr. Luke]], and [[Max Martin]]. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]] and [[Columbia Records]], she signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Capitol Records]] in April 2007.\n\nPerry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, ''[[One of the Boys]]'', a [[pop rock]] record containing the singles \"[[I Kissed a Girl]]\" and \"[[Hot n Cold]]\". The former track also sparked controversy for its themes of lesbianism. Her third album, ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' (2010), ventured into [[disco]], and was her first record to top the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

(song)|E.T.]]\", and \"[[Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)]]\", while \"[[The One That Got Away (Katy Perry song)|The One That Got Away]]\" reached number three on the chart. The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number one songs in the U.S., and the second overall after [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]''. In 2012, Perry re-issued the album as ''[[Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection]]'', which produced the songs \"[[Part of Me (Katy Perry song)|Part of Me]]\" and \"[[Wide Awake (song)|Wide Awake]]\". Her next record was ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013), which became her second to top the U.S. charts. It is influenced by pop and dance, and she became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on [[Vevo]] with the videos for its songs \"[[Roar (song)|Roar]]\" and \"[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]\". She followed this with 2017's ''[[Witness (Katy Perry album)|Witness]]'', which delved into [[electropop]] and became her third album to chart at number one in the U.S. \"[[Chained to the Rhythm]]\" was the album's most successful single, breaking [[Spotify]]'s record at the time for most first-day streams for a song by a female artist.\n\nPerry has [[List of awards and nominations received by Katy Perry|received various awards]], including four [[Guinness World Records]], five [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], five [[American Music Awards]], a [[Brit Award]], a [[Juno Award]], and thirteen [[Grammy Award]] nominations.

After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in [[gospel music]] as a teenager. Perry signed with [[Pamplin Music|Red Hill Records]] and released her debut studio album ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]'' under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to [[Los Angeles]] the following year to venture into [[Secularity|secular]] music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers [[Glen Ballard]], [[Dr. Luke]], and [[Max Martin]]. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]] and [[Columbia Records]], she signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Capitol Records]] in April 2007.\n\nPerry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, ''[[One of the Boys]]'', a [[pop rock]] record containing the singles \"[[I Kissed a Girl]]\" and \"[[Hot n Cold]]\". The former track also sparked controversy for its themes of lesbianism. Her third album, ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' (2010), ventured into [[disco]], and was her first record to top the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It peaked at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with the singles \"[[California Gurls]]\", \"[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]\", \"[[Firework (song)|Firework]]\", \"[[E.T. (song)|E.T.]]\", and \"[[Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)]]\", while \"[[The One That Got Away (Katy Perry song)|The One That Got Away]]\" reached number three on the chart. The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number one songs in the U.S., and the second overall after [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]''. In 2012, Perry re-issued the album as ''[[Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection]]'', which produced the songs \"[[Part of Me (Katy Perry song)|Part of Me]]\" and \"[[Wide Awake (song)|Wide Awake]]\". Her next record was ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013), which became her second to top the U.S. charts. It is influenced by pop and dance, and she became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on [[Vevo]] with the videos for its songs \"[[Roar (song)|Roar]]\" and \"[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]\". She followed this with 2017's ''[[Witness (Katy Perry album)|Witness]]'', which delved into [[electropop]] and became her third album to chart at number one in the U.S. \"[[Chained to the Rhythm]]\" was the album's most successful single, breaking [[Spotify]]'s record at the time for most first-day streams for a song by a female artist.\n\nPerry has [[List of awards and nominations received by Katy Perry|received various awards]], including four [[Guinness World Records]], five [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], five [[American Music Awards]], a [[Brit Award]], a [[Juno Award]], and thirteen [[Grammy Award]] nominations. She has been included in the annual ''[[Forbes]]'' lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011\u20132019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. She is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]], having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled ''[[Katy Perry: Part of Me]]'' in 2012, and voiced [[Smurfette]] in the 2011 film ''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'' and [[The Smurfs 2|its sequel]] in 2013.

They continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.\n\nRutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women's basketball programs, owning a 6-4 all-time [[bowl game|bowl]] record and appearing in a [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|National Final]] in 2007, respectively. In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home [[HighPoint.com Stadium]] on the [[Busch Campus of Rutgers University|Busch Campus]], and the basketball teams play at [[Louis Brown Athletic Center]] on [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston Campus]]. Both venues and campuses are located in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], immediately across the [[Raritan River]] from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]]. The university also fields rising men's basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers' fan base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], not to mention its alumni base, which is the largest in the state.\n\nRutgers' satellite campuses in Camden and Newark each field their own athletic programs. The [[Rutgers\u2013Camden]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Camden Scarlet Raptors|Scarlet Raptors]]. The [[Rutgers\u2013Newark]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Newark Scarlet Raiders|Scarlet Raiders]]. The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].\n\nSeton Hall, unlike Rutgers and Princeton, does not field a football team. Its men's basketball team, however, is one of the Big East's storied programs, New Jersey's most successful representative in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] by number of wins, the state's only men's basketball program to reach a modern [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|National Final]], and plays its home games at [[Prudential Center]] in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] approximately four miles from the university's [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] campus. The Pirates, while lacking as large an alumni base as the state university, have a large well of support in the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the [[Jersey Shore]]. The annual inter-conference rivalry game between Seton Hall and Rutgers which alternates between Newark and Piscataway, the Garden State Hardwood Classic, has been renewed through 2026.<ref>https://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2018/04/30/rutgers-seton-hall-basketball-garden-state-hardwood-classic/563768002/</ref>\n\n===Other schools===\nThe state's other Division I schools include the [[Monmouth Hawks|Monmouth University Hawks]] (West Long Branch), the [[NJIT Mens Soccer|New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders]] (Newark), the [[Rider University#Athletics|Rider University Broncs]] (Lawrenceville), and the [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey#Athletics|Saint Peter's University Peacocks and Peahens]] (Jersey City).\n\n[[Fairleigh Dickinson Knights|Fairleigh Dickinson University]] competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the [[Northeast Conference]] and NCAA Division I. The College at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the [[Middle Atlantic Conferences#Freedom Conference|Middle Atlantic Conferences' Freedom Conference]] and NCAA Division III.\n\nAmong the various Division III schools in the state, the [[Stevens Tech Ducks football|Stevens Institute of Technology]] Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men's lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.\n\n==High school sports==\nNew Jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]].(NJSIAA) <ref>[http://www.njsiaa.org/ NJSIAA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>'<ref>[http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ New Jersey High School News and Sports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418224118/http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ |date=2009-04-18 }}. iHigh.com, Inc \u2013 The High School Internet Network.

They continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.\n\nRutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women's basketball programs, owning a 6-4 all-time [[bowl game|bowl]] record and appearing in a [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|National Final]] in 2007, respectively. In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home [[HighPoint.com Stadium]] on the [[Busch Campus of Rutgers University|Busch Campus]], and the basketball teams play at [[Louis Brown Athletic Center]] on [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston Campus]]. Both venues and campuses are located in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], immediately across the [[Raritan River]] from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]]. The university also fields rising men's basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers' fan base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], not to mention its alumni base, which is the largest in the state.\n\nRutgers' satellite campuses in Camden and Newark each field their own athletic programs. The [[Rutgers\u2013Camden]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Camden Scarlet Raptors|Scarlet Raptors]]. The [[Rutgers\u2013Newark]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Newark Scarlet Raiders|Scarlet Raiders]]. The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].\n\nSeton Hall, unlike Rutgers and Princeton, does not field a football team. Its men's basketball team, however, is one of the Big East's storied programs, New Jersey's most successful representative in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] by number of wins, the state's only men's basketball program to reach a modern [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|National Final]], and plays its home games at [[Prudential Center]] in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] approximately four miles from the university's [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] campus. The Pirates, while lacking as large an alumni base as the state university, have a large well of support in the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the [[Jersey Shore]]. The annual inter-conference rivalry game between Seton Hall and Rutgers which alternates between Newark and Piscataway, the Garden State Hardwood Classic, has been renewed through 2026.<ref>https://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2018/04/30/rutgers-seton-hall-basketball-garden-state-hardwood-classic/563768002/</ref>\n\n===Other schools===\nThe state's other Division I schools include the [[Monmouth Hawks|Monmouth University Hawks]] (West Long Branch), the [[NJIT Mens Soccer|New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders]] (Newark), the [[Rider University#Athletics|Rider University Broncs]] (Lawrenceville), and the [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey#Athletics|Saint Peter's University Peacocks and Peahens]] (Jersey City).\n\n[[Fairleigh Dickinson Knights|Fairleigh Dickinson University]] competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the [[Northeast Conference]] and NCAA Division I. The College at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the [[Middle Atlantic Conferences#Freedom Conference|Middle Atlantic Conferences' Freedom Conference]] and NCAA Division III.\n\nAmong the various Division III schools in the state, the [[Stevens Tech Ducks football|Stevens Institute of Technology]] Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men's lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.\n\n==High school sports==\nNew Jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]].(NJSIAA) <ref>[http://www.njsiaa.org/ NJSIAA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>'<ref>[http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ New Jersey High School News and Sports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418224118/http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ |date=2009-04-18 }}. iHigh.com, Inc \u2013 The High School Internet Network.
